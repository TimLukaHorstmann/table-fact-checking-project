Check the attendance for each week with a game at mile high stadium:\n   - For row 2 (week 2), the attendance is 62669 which is larger than 52169.\n   - For row 3 (week 3), the attendance is 62975 which is larger than 52169.\n   - For row 6 (week 6), the attendance is 63431 which is larger than 52169.\n   - For row 7 (week 7), the attendance is 57961 which is not larger than 52169. However, this doesn't invalidate the claim because we are only interested in weeks with an attendance > 52169.\n   - For row 9 (week 9), the attendance is 62703 which is larger than 52169.\n   - For row 11 (week 11), the attendance is 63151 which is larger than 52169.\n   - For row 13 (week 13), the attendance is 58170 which is larger than 52169.\n\n4. Count how many of these weeks have an attendance larger than 52169: There are 6 such weeks (rows 2, 3, 6, 9, 11, 13).\n\n5. Compare with the claim: The number of weeks (8) that have a game site of mile high stadium is greater than or equal to the number of weeks (6) with an attendance larger than 52169.
