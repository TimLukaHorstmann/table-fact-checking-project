Since both teams do not have data beyond the first row, we can infer that there is only one round of matches between them.\n3. Compare the scores in the first round for each team: 4 - 4.\n4. Recall that a tie in sports usually means that the teams have equal scores and no additional match or rule is needed to determine the winner (unless specified otherwise in this context). However, the claim suggests that the match might require a different rule for deciding the winner due to the use of the term \"aggregate.\"\n5. Since the scores are tied, we need to check if any other rules have been specified in the table or context that would suggest a different outcome. No such rule is present in the table or claim.\n6.

For each of these matches, calculate the aggregate score to determine if it reaches or surpasses 8 goals.
