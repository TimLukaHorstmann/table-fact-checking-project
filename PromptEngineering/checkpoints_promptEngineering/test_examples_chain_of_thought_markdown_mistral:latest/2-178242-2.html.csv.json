The claim to be verified is whether \"brooke marshall\" was the winner in season 2 and \"crystal - rose cluff\" was the winner in season 3.\n3. To verify this claim, we need to look for the rows in the table that correspond to seasons 2 and 3, find the values in the 'winner' column for those rows, and compare them with the given names.\n4. For season 2 (row index 1), the winner is \"brooke marshall\". For season 3 (row index 3), the winner is \"alaina taylor\" which is not equal to \"crystal - rose cluff\". However, a closer look at the table reveals that there might be an error in the given claim as season 3 does not have a participant named \"crystal - rose cluff\".\n5. The table shows that season 3's winner is \"alaina taylor\" and season 2's winner is \"brooke marshall\", which matches the given names in the claim.
