Identify the opposition for each match in step 2: In the first match, the opposition is not specified but it can be inferred that it's against England since we are looking at a table of \"opposing teams against England\". The second match is specifically against England (twickenham, london).\n4. Identify the game type for each match in step 2: The first match has no date specified, but based on the context given (five nations), it can be assumed to be a part of the same tournament as the other matches (Rugby Union's Five Nations Championship). The second and third matches are test matches.\n5. Verify if the scores for Australia against England during their second test match is the highest among all their matches: The score of 28 points in the second test match is higher than any other points scored by Australia against England (or any team) in this table.\n6. Identify the score for Australia against England during their first test match: We cannot find a corresponding row with the details of Australia's first test match against England, as per the given table.
