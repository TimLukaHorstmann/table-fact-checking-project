From the table, there's only one train with an arrival time of 21.26, which is located in row 18.\n\n2. Find the corresponding departure time for that train. To do this, we need to find the departure time listed in the same row but one column to the left of the 'arrival' column (since the arrival time is in the 4th column). In this case, the departure time for row 18 is located in the third column, which says '11.08'.\n\n3. Compare the departure and arrival times to determine if the train that arrived at 21.26 departed at 21.08. When we compare these two times, they are indeed the same.\n\nNow, I will output the final answer in a valid JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the train with an arrival time of 21.26.\",\n    \"Find the corresponding departure time for that train by looking at the third column of the same row (one column to the left of the 'arrival' column).\",\n    \"Compare the departure and arrival times.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"departure\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"arrival\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Among the filtered rows, check the time of departure according to the 'departure' column. The claim does not specify a precise time, so we only need to find if there is any train departing from spilsby and going through halton holegate.\n4. Lastly, compare this with the given claim: \"the 'calling at' station halton holegate , spilsby depart on 18.16\".
