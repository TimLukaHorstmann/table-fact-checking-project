Observe the team for this game, it should be associated with LeBron James and Mo Williams. In the table, the game with the team listed as \"miami heat\" matches this requirement.\n3. Look for a column that indicates the high points scored on this date by LeBron James and Mo Williams together. The relevant column is \"score\". The value in the cell corresponds to the sum of individual scores, so we find 34 (LeBron's score) + x (Mo Williams's score).\n4. Search for another row where LeBron James and Mo Williams are present again, this time as the players with the highest points scored on that day. This information is not explicitly provided in the table, but since they were the highest scorers on November 14, we know their combined score on a different date can't exceed the one found for November 14.\n5. Based on steps 1-4, if the sum of LeBron James and Mo Williams's scores on November 14 is greater than or equal to 21 (which it is not), then the claim is FALSE.

The value for this cell is \"w 111 - 104 (ot)\" indicating the final score of the game was 111 points won by the team.\n3.
