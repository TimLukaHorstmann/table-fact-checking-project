    "resp": "Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the names in the table to compare with the name mentioned in the claim (in this case, there is no exact match for the name associated with the TD count of 209). However, we can see that Jim Hart has a completion count of 2590 and attempts of 5069, which results in a completion percentage of approximately 51.1%. We also note that the QB rating is 66.6 for an unknown player.\n\n2. Since there's no exact match for the name with 209 TDs, we can look for players who have the same QB rating (66.6) and compare their TD count to see if it is close to 209. In this table, only one player (Jim Hart) has a QB rating of 66.6, but his touchdown count does not match the claimed number (209).\n\n3. Since Jim Hart's TD count doesn't match the claimed number and there is no exact match for the name with 209 TDs in the table, we can infer that the player who scored 209 touchdowns did not have a QB rating of 66.6.\n\nNow, let's present our answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the name associated with each row in the table.\",\n    \"Look for any matching names or QB ratings to the claimed number/rating.\",\n    \"Compare the TD count and QB rating of players who have a close match (same QB rating, in this case) to the claimed number/rating.\",\n    \"Conclude based on our comparison that the player who scored 209 touchdowns did not have a QB rating of 66.6.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"completions\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attempts\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"completion %\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"qb rating\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"TDs\" }\n  ]\n}",
