Each row of the table represents a different team, with columns detailing the overall record, specific records at Austin (UT's home venue), opponent's venue, neutral site, last 5 meetings, last 10 meetings, current streak, and the result of the most recent game.\n3. The claim is about whether the table shows scores on different locations for each game between UT and a different team.\n4. To verify this claim, we need to check if there are entries in the table where the location (overall record, Austin, opponent's venue, neutral site) differs across rows for games against the same team.\n5. By comparing rows for each team in the \"texas vs\" column, we can see that different locations are provided for various teams, such as:\n   - Baylor: Austin (UT's home), opponent's venue, neutral site\n   - Colorado: Austin, opponent's venue, neutral site, UT's home\n   - Iowa State: Austin, opponent's venue, neutral site, ISU's home\n   - etc.\n6.
