From the table, we can see that there is one row with 'charlotte' as the 'team' and the date of the game is April 3rd (row index 1).\n3. Check if the value in the 'score' column for this row indicates a win for Charlotte. In this case, the score is 97 - 92 (overtime) and Charlotte has a higher score, so it is considered a win.\n4. Check the 'record' column to see if it matches the expected record of 40 - 36 after a win. The value in the 'record' column for this row is 40 - 36 (which matches our claim).\n5.

    "resp": "1. Identify the player mentioned in the claim: The player referred to in the claim is Michael Beasley.\n\n2. Search the table for rows where the 'team' column matches the team where Michael Beasley was playing at the time (since we know he only played with one team during the games listed in the table): In this case, we can see that Michael Beasley played for two teams - Miami Heat and Minnesota Timberwolves. However, since the games mentioned in the table are all from when he was with the Miami Heat, we will focus on those rows.\n\n3. Verify whether Michael Beasley is listed as the highest scorer in any of these rows: We can see that in row 71, 79, and 81, Michael Beasley is listed as the highest scorer for his team. However, we need to find out if there are other instances where he is still the highest scorer but not explicitly mentioned in the 'score' column (because it includes more than one player with the same score).\n\n4. Check for overlapping scores: In row 71 and 81, we see that Dwyane Wade and Michael Beasley both have 23 and 23 points respectively. However, since the claim specifically asks for when \"Michael Beasley\" is the highest scorer, we can consider these instances as not relevant to our search.\n\n5. Identify the row where Michael Beasley has the highest score: The only remaining relevant row is row 79, where Michael Beasley scored 31 points and he is listed as the highest scorer.\n\n6. Verify whether the score in this row matches the score mentioned in the claim (w 97 - 92 (ot)): In row 79, the score is l 98 - 105 (ot), which does not match the score mentioned in the claim (w 97 - 92 (ot)).\n\nThe final answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the player in the claim\", \"Search the table for rows where the 'team' column matches the team of the player in the claim\", \"Verify whether Michael Beasley is listed as the highest scorer in any of these rows\", \"Check for overlapping scores\", \"Identify the row where Michael Beasley has the highest score\", \"Verify whether the score in this row matches the score mentioned in the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 79, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]\n}",
