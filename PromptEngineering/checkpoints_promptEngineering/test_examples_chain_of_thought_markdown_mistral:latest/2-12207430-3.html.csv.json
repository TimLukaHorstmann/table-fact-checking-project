    "resp": "Here are the steps in my reasoning:\n1. Identify the team and date mentioned in the claim: The team is the Toronto Blue Jays, and the date is May 12th.\n2. Find the corresponding row in the table for that team and date: In this table, rows represent games, with each row showing the details of a single game. The team and date specified match the ones in row number 12.\n3. Check the record column in the found row: The Record value in row 12 is \"18 - 12\".\n4. Determine if the outcome of the game affects the record: In this case, the game was a loss for the Toronto Blue Jays (score 3 - 1).\n5. Check if there are any other games on May 12th that affect the record as well: No other games were played on May 12th.\n6. Combine the findings from steps 3 and 4 to determine whether the claim is true or false: The loss decreases the Blue Jays' record by one game, so their new record would be \"18 - 13\". However, in step 3, we found that the current record was already \"18 - 12\", which matches our calculated result. Therefore, the loss did not affect the record, and the team's record remains at \"18 - 12\".\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team and date mentioned in the claim.\",\n    \"Find the corresponding row in the table for that team and date.\",\n    \"Check the record column in the found row.\",\n    \"Determine if the outcome of the game affects the record.\",\n    \"Check if there are any other games on May 12th that affect the record as well.\",\n    \"Combine the findings from steps 3-5 to determine whether the claim is true or false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Record\" }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "1. Identify the team that the Kansas City Royals faced after May 12th. In this table, the Royals played against the Blue Jays only on May 11 and May 14.\n\n2. Check if there's a game after May 12th where the Royals have a record of 18 - 12 or higher. The attendance data in the table suggests that there was no game between May 13th and May 20th, so we can focus on games after May 20th. In this table, the Royals' highest win-loss record is 18-12 on May 14 (after facing the Blue Jays), but there's no game with a higher win-loss record or later than May 14 that involves the Royals and the Blue Jays.\n\n3. Combine the steps to determine if the claim is true or false. The claim is about a date when the Kansas City Royals beat the Blue Jays with a record of 18 - 12 or higher after May 12th, but in this table, there's no such game.
