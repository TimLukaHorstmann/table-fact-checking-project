We can see from the 'uefa cup' column that all players have more than or equal to 10 appearances (Michael Dawson, Paul Robinson, Pascal Chimbonda, Jermain Defoe, and Robbie Keane all have more than 10).\n3. Next, we need to find out if there is any player who has less than 4 appearances at the League Cup.\n4. Again, we can see from the 'league cup' column that all players have more than or equal to 4 appearances (except for the case of 'goalkeeper' Paul Robinson who has only 3, but as there are no goalkeepers with less than 4 appearances in this table, this does not affect our claim).\n5. Since all players in the table meet both conditions (more than or equal to 10 UEFA cup appearances and more than or equal to 4 League cup appearances), it implies that there is no team in the Premier League with less than 10 appearance at UEFA and less than 4 at the League Cup.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check if any player has less than 10 appearances at UEFA cup\",\n    \"Check if any player has less than 4 appearances at League cup\",\n    \"Since all players meet both conditions, there is no team in the Premier League with less than 10 appearance at UEFA and less than 4 at the League Cup\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"uefa cup\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"league cup\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"uefa cup\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"league cup\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"uefa cup\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"league cup\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"uefa cup\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"league cup\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"uefa cup\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"league cup\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The total number of appearances for Michael Dawson in the Premier League is 57 (as shown in the 'total' column).\n3. Finally, compare the total number of appearances found in step 2 with the number given in the claim (44).

Check the number of appearances for each player at the FA Cup: The table shows that Michael Dawson, Paul Robinson, Pascal Chimbonda, Jermain Defoe, and Robbie Keane have 6, 4, 4, 5, and 5 appearances respectively in the FA cup.\n2. Check the number of appearances for each player at the Premier League: The table shows that Michael Dawson, Paul Robinson, Pascal Chimbonda, Jermain Defoe, and Robbie Keane have 37, 38, 33, 33, and 27 appearances respectively in the Premier League.\n3. Check if there's a player with less than 6 FA cup appearances, 33 Premier League appearances, and more than 5 UEFA Cup appearances: Only Robbie Keane meets all these conditions (he has 5 FA cup appearances, 33 Premier League appearances, and more than 5 UEFA Cup appearances).\n4.
