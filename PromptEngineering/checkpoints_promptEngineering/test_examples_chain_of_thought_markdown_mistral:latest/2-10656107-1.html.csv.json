We filter these based on the condition that the \"Team\" column contains \"Boston Celtics\", which leaves us with 5 rows: rows 25, 26, and 27 for his games in Boston, and rows 28 and 28 (repeated due to a mismatch in birthdate) for his game against the Orlando Magic (which is not the Boston Celtics).\n5. Compare dates: Among these rows, we need to find the earliest date. Rows 26, 27, and 28 have different birthdates, but row 25 has a date that is earlier than all of them. Specifically, it is on January 13th, 1989 (3-18-1988 in the table format).\n6.

This is because in the initial dataset, \"Steals\" were listed as \"Assists\" and \"Blocks\" were not included.\n\n2. Check the values of \"Assists\" for each row to find out the number of steals for each player.\n\n3. Next, check if there are any missing values (indicated by '?') in the \"Assists\" column. If so, we cannot make a definitive conclusion as those rows would be left out from our comparison. However, in this case, there are no missing values.\n\n4. Now compare the number of steals for each player to find which one has the highest number. In this dataset, Lebron James has 3 assists (which we assume represents steals) in row 28, while other players have fewer.\n\n5. Check if any player also has a higher number of blocks than Lebron James. To do this, check the values of \"Blocks\" for each row and compare them with James's value of zero blocks (indicated by '?' as no blocks were recorded for him). Among all the players in the dataset, only one player (Hakeem Olajuwon) has a non-zero number of blocks. However, his total blocks are less than James's steals.\n\n6. Final answer: Since Lebron James has the highest number of steals among all the players and no other player has more blocks, it can be concluded that \"Lebron James has the highest number of steals and blocks than any other player.\"\n\nHowever, the dataset does not include records for blocks for most of the players, making a definitive comparison impossible.
