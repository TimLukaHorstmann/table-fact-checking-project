    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. First, we need to identify which rows of the table correspond to the builder 'hudswell clarke'. This can be found by checking the builder column.\n2. Next, we need to find out if any row for hudswell clarke has rr numbers before 1914. To do this, we will compare the year column of each row for hudswell clarke with the year 1914.\n3. We then look at the rows where the builder is 'hudswell clarke' and the year is less than 1914. From the table, there are two such rows: one in 1911 with rr nos 15, 18 - 22 and another in 1916 with no rr nos listed.\n4. However, we are specifically interested in continuous ranges of rr numbers. The 1911 row has a range 15, 18 - 22, but the claim specifies '15 and 18 - 22'. Since 15 is not part of the given range (18-22), this row does not satisfy the claim.\n5. The 1916 row has no rr numbers listed, so it also doesn't satisfy the claim.\n6. Therefore, the table does not have a row that satisfies the condition 'the rr number of hudsweel clarke before 1914 be 15 and 18 - 22'.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows corresponding to hudswell clarke\",\n    \"Check if any row for hudswell clarke has rr numbers before 1914\",\n    \"Compare the year column of each row for hudswell clarke with the year 1914\",\n    \"Look at rows where builder is 'hudswell clarke' and year < 1914\",\n    \"Check if the rr numbers in these rows satisfy the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"rr nos\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"rr nos\" }\n  ]\n}",
