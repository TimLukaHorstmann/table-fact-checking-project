    "resp": "Here is the reasoning process:\n1. First, examine the table to identify drivers associated with the Williams - BMW constructor.\n2. Next, check the 'constructor' column of each row to determine if any driver listed is from the Williams - BMW team. The relevant rows are those of Ralf Schumacher (row 5), Jenson Button (row 18) and Jenson Button again under a different race (row 20).\n3. Now, check the 'time / retired' column for these identified drivers to determine if any have a time greater than zero. The only driver from Williams - BMW with a time greater than zero is Ralf Schumacher (row 5), and his time is +37.311.\n4. Lastly, compare the claimed 'time / retired' of +37.311 to the actual time for any driver in the Williams - BMW team. The actual time for a driver from this team is +37.311 (Ralf Schumacher), which matches the claim.\n\n   Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\n       \"Identify drivers associated with Williams - BMW\",\n       \"Check 'constructor' column for each driver\",\n       \"Find relevant rows of drivers from Williams - BMW\",\n       \"Check 'time / retired' column for these drivers\",\n       \"Compare the claimed 'time / retired' to the actual time\"\n     ],\n     \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       {\n         \"row_index\": 5,\n         \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }",
