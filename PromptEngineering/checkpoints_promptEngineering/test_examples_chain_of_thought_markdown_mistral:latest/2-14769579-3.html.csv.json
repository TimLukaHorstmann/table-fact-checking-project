Find the row corresponding to 2002: Since we know that the year is 2002, we look for the row where the year matches '2002'. In this table, it is the 7th row.\n\n3. Check if Hiroshi Yamamoto won the bronze medal in 2002: To do this, we compare the name in the 'location' column (as we know that if Hiroshi Yamamoto won a medal in 2002, he must be from the location mentioned in this row) with the names in the 'bronze' column of the same row. In this case, it is \"hiroshi yamamoto\", which matches the name we are looking for (Hiroshi Yamamoto).\n\n4. Confirm the location is India: Since Hiroshi Yamamoto won a bronze medal in 2002, the location he was from should be relevant to the claim. The claim mentions that this happened in \"India\". In this table, we can see that \"new delhi\" (which could be considered as a part of India) is not mentioned as the location where any medals were won by Hiroshi Yamamoto after 2002.\n\n5. Final Answer: Based on the above reasoning, we find that Hiroshi Yamamoto did win the bronze medal in 2002 (as per the table).
