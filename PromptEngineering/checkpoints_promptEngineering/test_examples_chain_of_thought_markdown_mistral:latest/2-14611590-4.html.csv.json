    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. First, understand the claim. The claim states that all players in the top 5 of 1995 had earnings over $7 million.\n2. Identify the relevant columns from the table. In this case, we need the country column (to determine which year corresponds to 1995) and the earnings column (to check if they have more than $7 million).\n3. Since all players in the table are ranked, it implies that these are the top 5 players of some years. To find out the exact year for each player, we would need additional information such as their career span or the specific tournament(s) they won. However, without this data, we cannot definitively say if these players were the top 5 winners in 1995.\n4. Even if we knew that these players were from 1995, we still couldn't answer the question definitively because some players may not have won tournaments in 1995 and thus their earnings might be lower than $7 million in that year.\n5. Therefore, based on the given table, it is impossible to determine if the claim is true or false.\n\nSince we cannot determine the truth of the claim with the information provided, the answer will be as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Determine relevant columns\",\n    \"Recognize that without additional data, we cannot determine which year corresponds to these players\",\n    \"Understand that even if we knew the years, the claim cannot be answered definitively because some players might not have won in 1995\",\n    \"Conclude that it is impossible to determine the truth of the claim with the information provided\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"earnings\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"earnings\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"earnings\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"earnings\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"earnings\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
