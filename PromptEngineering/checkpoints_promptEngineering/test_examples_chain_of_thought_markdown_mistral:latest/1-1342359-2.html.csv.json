In this case, we have columns for district, incumbent, party, first elected, result, and candidates.\n2. The \"district\" column contains the districts of Alabama, and the \"incumbent\" column lists the representatives for each district.\n3. To check whether William B Oliver represents Alabama's 6th district, we should look for a row in the table where both the district and incumbent match \"Alabama 6\" and \"William B Oliver,\" respectively.\n4. If such a row exists, it would confirm that William B Oliver does indeed represent Alabama's 6th district. If no such row is found, then he doesn't represent Alabama's 6th district.\n5.
