Next, we find the row where the away team score is exactly 3.8 (26) and the home team score is greater than or equal to 5.12 (42). This will help us identify the match for which the crowd would be larger than 23135 if both teams played at that venue.\n3. We observe that the fourth row of the table matches these conditions as it describes a game between fitzroy and geelong with away team score (Geelong) being 8.7 (55) and home team score (Fitzroy) being 5.11 (41). However, the crowd for this match was 13802 which is less than our required number (23135).\n4. We continue to check other rows but we do not find any that meet the conditions specified in the claim.\n\nSince no such match on May 7th, 1960 can be found in the table, the crowd at a game on that day would not have been larger than 23135 for an away team score of 3.8 (26) and a home team score of 5.12 (42).\n\nHere's my output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find the row corresponding to the given date, Identify the row where the away team score is exactly 3.8 (26) and the home team score is greater than or equal to 5.12 (42), Observe if the crowd for this match is larger than 23135.\", \"No such match on May 7th, 1960 can be found in the table.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
