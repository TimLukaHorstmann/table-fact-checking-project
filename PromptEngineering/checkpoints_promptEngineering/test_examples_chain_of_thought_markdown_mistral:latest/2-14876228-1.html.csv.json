    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to find the teams that are positioned higher than 10. In our table, there are no teams in positions higher than 10 (positions 1-9), so we only need to consider these teams.\n\n2. Next, for each of these teams, we'll check the \"scored\" column to see if it's zero or not. If a team has scored zero goals, then the claim is true for that particular team.\n\n3. We find that none of the teams in positions 1-9 (cerro porte\u00f1o, guaran\u00ed, nacional, 3 de febrero, 12 de octubre, tacuary, libertad, sportivo luque\u00f1o, general caballero zc, olimpia) have scored zero goals.\n\n4. Since all the teams in positions higher than 10 (1-9) haven't scored zero goals, and according to the claim, we are looking for a situation where the total number of scores for these teams is zero, therefore the claim \"the total number score of the team position higher than 10 be zero\" is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the teams that are positioned higher than 10\",\n    \"Check each team's 'scored' column to see if it's zero or not\",\n    \"If a team has scored zero goals, then the claim is true for that particular team\",\n    \"Repeat for all the teams that are higher than 10 and check if their total scores are zero\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"scored\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"scored\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"scored\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"scored\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"scored\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"scored\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"scored\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"scored\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"scored\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"scored\" }\n  ]\n}",
