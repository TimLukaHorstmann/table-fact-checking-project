    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the team we are looking for, which is \"cup noodle - honda\".\n2. Determine the machine they used, which is nsr250 (in both 1993 and 1994).\n3. Find all rows where the team matches our criteria and the machine is nsr250. In this table, there are two such rows (1993 and 1994).\n4. Check the \"points\" column for these rows to see if any of them have less than 8 points. Both 1993 and 1994 have more than 8 points.\n5. Since none of the found rows meet the requirement of having less than 8 points, it means that \"cup noodle honda\" did not use nsr250 and had less than 8 points.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify team 'cup noodle - honda' and machine 'nsr250', find all relevant rows, check the 'points' column for these rows to see if any have less than 8 points.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"machine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"machine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
