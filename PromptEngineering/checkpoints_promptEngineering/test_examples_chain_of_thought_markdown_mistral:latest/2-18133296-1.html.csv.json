Find the governments where the Kadima party was a part of, as per the claim.\n3. Check if there is any row that has \"Kadima\" as the party under the \"party\" column and a non-zero value in the \"governments\" column (indicating the government number).\n\nAfter examining the table:\n\n1. The list of ministers includes a minister named Tzipi Livni who belongs to the Kadima party.\n2. In her row, under the \"party\" column, it is mentioned as \"Kadima\", and under the \"governments\" column, it shows \"31\".\n3. Therefore, there exists a government (number 31) that has the Kadima party.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify ministers and their parties, find governments with the Kadima party, check if there is any row that has 'Kadima' as the party under the 'party' column and a non-zero value in the 'governments' column.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"party\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"governments\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's my reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the government number associated with each minister and compare it with the claimed government number (31).\n2. Check the table for any row where the 'government' column matches the claimed value (31).\n3. If a match is found, then the claim is TRUE as the start of government 31 occurred before 18 January 2006 (the date associated with it in the table).\n4. If no match is found, then the claim is FALSE as there was no government starting before 18 January 2006 with a number equal to 31.\n\nNow let's check the table:\n\n1. Find the row containing the claimed government number (31)\n2. Inspecting the table, we find that the minister \"tzipi livni\" belongs to government 31 and its term start is \"18 January 2006\".\n\nSince there's a match for the claimed value in the table, the claim is TRUE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify government number associated with each minister\", \"Check if any row matches the claimed government number (31)\", \"If yes, then claim is true\", \"If no, then claim is false\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"government\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"term start\"}]\n}",
