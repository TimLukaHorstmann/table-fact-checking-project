    "resp": "Here's the reasoning:\n1. Check the date of the game mentioned in the claim, which is January 18.\n2. Find the corresponding cell in the table for the date (row_index=18) and the team record (column_name=\"Wins\", \"Losses\", \"Overtime Losses\").\n3. The team record before the game on January 18 will be the last record of the Chicago Blackhawks in the table, as each row represents a new day. In this case, it is the row with index 17 (January 15).\n4. Look at the last cell of the 17th row under the \"Wins\" column to determine the number of wins before January 18.\n5. Check the value in the cell with row_index=17 and column_name=\"Wins\", which is 16.\n6. Recall that the claim states that after the game on January 18, the record becomes \"13 - 11 - 3\". Comparing this with the calculated win count for before the game (step 4), we see that it matches (16=13).\n7. However, we also need to consider the number of losses and overtime losses. The number of losses for the Chicago Blackhawks before January 18 can be found by looking at the cell with row_index=17 and column_name=\"Losses\", which is 11 (the same as in the claim). For overtime losses, we look at the corresponding cell, but it is not mentioned in the table. Since there are no overtime losses in this case, we can assume that the record remains unchanged for overtime losses as well.\n8. Therefore, since both wins and losses match, the entire record (wins, losses, and overtime losses) will remain the same after the game on January 18, which contradicts the claim.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check date of game mentioned in the claim\",\n    \"Find corresponding cell in table for the given date\",\n    \"Determine team record before game mentioned in the claim\",\n    \"Compare the calculated team record before the game with the team record provided in the claim\",\n    \"Consider the number of losses and overtime losses to verify consistency across all categories\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Wins\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Losses\" }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n1. Identify the game on January 6 from the table. The relevant cell is [row_index: 18, column_name: \"Result\"]. In this game, the result for Chicago Blackhawks is a loss against Boston Bruins (4 - 3).\n2. Update the record of Chicago Blackhawks after this game. To do so, we sum up their wins (17), losses (4) and ties (3) and store this information as a JSON object. The relevant cell for their wins is [row_index: 3, column_name: \"Wins\"], for their losses is [row_index: 3, column_name: \"Losses\"] and for their ties is [row_index: 3, column_name: \"Ties\"]. The updated record is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n  \"wins\": 17 - 1, // 16\n  \"losses\": 4 + 1, // 5\n  \"ties\": 3, // same\n}\n```\n\n3. Combine the updated wins (16), losses (5) and ties (3) to get the new record for Chicago Blackhawks: 16 - 5 - 3 = 8 - 10 - 3.\n4. Compare the claimed record with the calculated record. The claim is that after the game on January 6, the record becomes 9 - 10 - 3.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, identify the current record for the Chicago Blackhawks from the provided table. The last game listed is on March 19th. However, we need to find the record up until January 18th. We can count the number of wins (W), losses (L), and ties/overtime losses (T) in this range.\n\n2. Counting from the beginning of the table:\n   - Number of Wins (up to Jan 18): 16 (from row indices 0-53, excluding rows 44, 51, and 57 since those correspond to games after January 18)\n   - Number of Losses (up to Jan 18): 13 (from row indices 6, 22, 29, 36, 40, 45, 48, 52, and 56)\n   - Number of Ties/Overtime losses (up to Jan 18): 2 (from row indices 3 and 47)\n\n3. The format for the relevant cells would be:\n   [\n     { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"W\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"L\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"T\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 47, \"column_name\": \"T\" }\n   ]\n\n4.
