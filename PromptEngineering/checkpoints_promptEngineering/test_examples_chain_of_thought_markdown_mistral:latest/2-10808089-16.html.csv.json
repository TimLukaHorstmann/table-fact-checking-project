Identify the column names to find the date, home team, and away team for each row:\n    - Column name for date: \"date\"\n    - Column name for home team: \"home team\"\n    - Column name for away team: \"away team\"\n\n2. Iterate through each row of the table (row_index) to check if the date and the home or away teams match the claimed date and teams (August 13th, 1966, Collingwood as home team, North Melbourne as away team):\n    - If the \"date\" in a given row equals \"13 august 1966\", compare the \"home team\" and \"away team\" to Collingwood and North Melbourne respectively.\n      - If both are true for a row, that means the claim is correct, so store the row_index in the relevant_cells list.\n      - If any comparison is false, move on to the next row.\n\n3. If no row matches the claimed date and teams after iterating through all rows, the claim is false, so add nothing to the relevant_cells list.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the column names for date, home team, and away team\",\n    \"Iterate through each row of the table to check if the given date and teams match any of the rows\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
