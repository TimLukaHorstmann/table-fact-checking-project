Identify the team and year in question from the claim: The team is not specified but based on the division names, it seems plausible to assume that the team belongs to the \"bafl\" league. The year in question is 2007.\n\n2. Find the row corresponding to the year 2007 and the relevant team's division: In this table, there are two divisions for 'bafl' in the given years. However, since we don't know the specific team, we can't narrow it down further based on the information provided.\n\n3. Verify the number of wins and losses in 2007: Even though we can't definitively identify the team at this point, we can compare the total wins (9) and losses (1) in 2007 against all the teams in that year's division(s).\n\n4. Calculate the winning percentage for 2007: Winning percentage is calculated as the number of wins divided by the total number of games played (wins + losses + ties). In this case, the winning percentage would be 9/10 = 0.9 or 90%.\n\n5. Identify if promotion occurred in 2007: We see that the team in question was promoted to division 1 north in 2007 (as noted in the table).\n\nSince we can't definitively identify a specific team from the given information, but we can confirm that a team had a winning percentage of 90% and got promoted, it is not possible to say with certainty if this claim is true or false for any particular team.
