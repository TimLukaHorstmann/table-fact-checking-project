Each row represents a different candidate, and each column shows their respective financial metrics during the third quarter (3q) of the election cycle.\n2. The relevant columns for our claim are \"cash on hand\", \"total debt\", and \"after debt\". These columns represent the amount of cash a candidate has in hand at the end of the third quarter, their total debt, and their net worth (cash on hand minus total debt).\n3. In the case of Duncan Hunter, we can see that his \"cash on hand\" is 132741 and his total debt is 82741.\n4. The claim states that there should be 132741 left in hand after debt of 82741, which corresponds to Hunter's data in the table.\n5. To verify whether this claim is true or false, we simply compare the \"cash on hand\" with the sum of \"cash on hand\" and \"total debt\".
