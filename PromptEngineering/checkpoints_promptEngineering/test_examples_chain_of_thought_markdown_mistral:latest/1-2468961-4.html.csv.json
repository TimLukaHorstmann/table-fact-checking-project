    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Identify the total number of episodes in the series by counting the rows in the table. There are 68 rows, so the last row (episode number 68) will be the final episode in the series.\n2. The claim states that the title of the 56th episode is \"Sister Act\". Therefore, we need to find out if there exists an episode titled \"Sister Act\" before the 56th episode (row 56).\n3. Count the episodes with titles in alphabetical order from the first row (episode number 1) up to the row just prior to the 56th episode (row 55). In this case, there are 55 episodes. This means that if we start counting at episode number 1 and stop at episode number 55, we have accounted for all the episodes except for the last one (episode number 68).\n4. Check the title of the 56th episode. Since it is not specified in the table, we cannot check this directly. However, since there are only 3 episodes left after the 55th episode (rows 56, 57, and 58), and their titles are already listed as \"Sister Act\", \"hog wild\", and \"down and out in port washington\" respectively, we can conclude that none of these titles match \"Sister Act\".\n5.
