In our table, the Widnes Vikings have a pts agst value of 220.\n4. Compare the pts agst value of the second-placed team (Widnes Vikings) with the rest of the teams in the table to see if any team has a higher score against them.\n\nIn this case, the Widnes Vikings have the second-lowest points score against them, as all other teams have higher scores. However, the claim states \"the widnes viking place second while have the highest point score against them\", which is not true according to our analysis of the table.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Determine position for each team, Identify team with second highest position, Check pts agst values, Compare pts agst values of the second-placed team with other teams\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"pts agst\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"pts agst\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"pts agst\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"pts agst\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"pts agst\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"pts agst\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"pts agst\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"pts agst\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"pts agst\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
