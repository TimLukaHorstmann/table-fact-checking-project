    "resp": "Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the driver who has the second best score in qualifier 2: In our table, we see that Justin Wilson scored 58.410 in qualifier 2, and Alex Tagliani scored 59.483 (the highest score). Since the scores are in increasing order within each column, we can infer that the second best score in qualifier 2 was 58.410 by Justin Wilson.\n\n2. Determine the overall best score: To find the overall best score, we compare the best scores from both qualifiers for each driver. In our table, we see that some drivers have identical best scores between their two qualifying runs (e.g., Will Power and Simon Pagenaud), while others do not (e.g., Justin Wilson's best score is in qualifier 1). To find the overall best score for all drivers, we sort the table by the best column in ascending order and take the smallest value. In our case, that would be Will Power with a score of 58.403.\n\n3. Compare the second-best qualifier score of Justin Wilson with the overall best score: Since we have determined that the second-best qualifier score for Justin Wilson is 58.410 and the overall best score (the smallest score in the table) is 58.403, we can see that Justin Wilson's second-best qualifier score is not the lowest overall.\n\nHowever, since the claim asks whether Justin Wilson has the \"second best score of the second qualifier to move up to number 3 overall,\" and we have determined that Justin Wilson's second-best qualifier score (58.410) is indeed the second-best among all drivers for qualifier 2, we can say that the claim holds true for this part but not for the entire statement.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the driver who has the second best score in qualifier 2.
