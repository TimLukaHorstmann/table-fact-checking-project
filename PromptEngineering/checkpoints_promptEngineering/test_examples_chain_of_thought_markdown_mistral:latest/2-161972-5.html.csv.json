Check if these rows have the same outcome (winner or runner-up). If they do not, it means the player has participated in three different tournaments in Rotterdam, Netherlands, but not necessarily as the winner three times.

Since Richard Krajicek does not appear as a winner or runner-up in any of these rows, this does not contribute to our count for matches between them.\n- The opponent column contains \"michael stich\" in rows 6, 18, and 30. In row 6 (with Richard Krajicek as the runner-up), Michael Stich is the winner, so we can consider it as one instance of a match between them. Similarly, in row 18, they have a match as well since Richard Krajicek is the runner-up and Michael Stich is the winner. However, there is no other occurrence for them playing against each other.\n- The opponent column contains \"andre agassi\" in rows 9, 20, and 33. In row 9, they have a match as Richard Krajicek is the runner-up and Andre Agassi is the winner. Similarly, in row 20, they have a match since Richard Krajicek is the runner-up and Andre Agassi is the winner.
