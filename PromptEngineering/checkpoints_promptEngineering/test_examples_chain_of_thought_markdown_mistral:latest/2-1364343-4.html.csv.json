First, understand that the table provided deals with regional Catholic populations, not roles within the Church hierarchy such as archbishops or bishops.\n2. The claim is about the role of archbishop/bishop in relation to the 12 apostles, which is a matter of Church history and doctrine, not population data. Therefore, the table doesn't provide any direct information related to the claim.\n3. However, we can infer that the roles of archbishops and bishops in the modern Catholic Church are part of its hierarchical structure, which is modeled on the apostles, who were the original disciples and leaders of the Church. The succession of the apostle Peter is particularly significant in this context as he is traditionally considered the first Pope.\n4. Since the roles of archbishops and bishops are part of the hierarchical structure that models the apostles, one could argue that they are successors of the apostles in a symbolic or spiritual sense. However, this interpretation is not explicitly stated in the table or the claim, and it relies on understanding the historical and doctrinal context of the Catholic Church.\n5.
