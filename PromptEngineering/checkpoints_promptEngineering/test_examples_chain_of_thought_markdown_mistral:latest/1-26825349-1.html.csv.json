Look for the original air date of this episode, which is found in cell at row 83 and column \"original air date\", i.e., May 7, 2009.\n3. Determine the number of the episode, as we need to verify if it's the 24th episode.

Look for all episodes in the table to see if there exists another with the same production code but a different original air date (to ensure that our chosen episode isn't part of a multi-part episode with a combined air date). In our table, we can find the production code \"4aky19\" in rows 72 and 83. However, both rows have the same original air date, which means that either episode 72 or 83 could be considered as part of a multi-part episode (since the production code is unique for each part but not the air date). In order to verify that, we need to check if there are any episodes with the same production code and lower row indices.\n5. Check all the rows above our chosen episode (rows 1 through 78) to see if there exists an episode with the same production code but a different original air date. Since we did not find any such episodes, it is possible that both episodes 72 and 83 belong to the same multi-part episode.\n6. To confirm whether our chosen episode (row 83) is the 24th episode or part of a multi-part 24th episode, we should look at its position within the season (since a multi-part episode is usually shown as one continuous story and not split across different episodes in the same season). In the table, it appears that row 83 belongs to the last 6 rows of the table, which are labeled as \"Season 1.\" Given that Season 1 contains only 25 episodes (as can be verified by counting all the rows within the \"Season 1\" segment), it is possible that our chosen episode is part of a multi-part 24th episode, and it would still count towards the overall 24 episodes.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify episode with 8.62 viewers.
