Next, we check if there are any other matches played on these exact dates at other venues to ensure that we are comparing the correct matches. However, from the table, we see that there are no other matches scheduled for those specific dates.\n\n3. Since the two venues have matches on the same date and there are no other matches on that date at other venues, it means we are comparing the match played at Estadio Campo Desportivo with the match played at Xianghe Sports Center.\n\n4. To determine if the results are the same, we compare the 'result' column for these two matches. From the table, we see that the result of the match at Estadio Campo Desportivo was 5 - 1 and the result of the match at Xianghe Sports Center was 2 - 2.\n\n5.
