Scan the table to find any row that matches the year and event specified in the claim (2009, Paul Hunter Classic). This will help us determine if there's a direct match for the claim.\n   3. From step 2, we can see two rows with the year 2009 and one of them is the Paul Hunter Classic event.\n   4. In these two rows, check the \"opponent in the final\" column to find out if the opponent in either of these events was Jimmy White.\n   5.

Determine the years when the Paul Hunter Classic took place - From the table, the event occurred in 2008 and 2009.\n3. Check if Jimmy White was an opponent in the final of the Paul Hunter Classic after 2009 - From the table, there are two entries for the Paul Hunter Classic, one in 2008 and one in 2009. In both cases, Jimmy White is listed as a winner, not an opponent. However, in 2009 he was indeed a participant (as seen from his name being associated with the event), but he was not listed as the opponent in the final.\n4. Compare the given year (after 2009) with the years found in step 2 - Since the Paul Hunter Classic did not take place after 2009, there can be no instance where Jimmy White is the opponent in the final of the Paul Hunter Classic after 2009.\n\nThe answer to the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells:\n[\n  { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"outcome\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\" }\n]\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the event\",\n    \"Determine the years it took place\",\n    \"Check if Jimmy White was an opponent after 2009\",\n    \"Compare the given year with the found years\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"outcome\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\" }\n  ]\n}",
