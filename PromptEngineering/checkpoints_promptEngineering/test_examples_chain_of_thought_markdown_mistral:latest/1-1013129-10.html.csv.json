    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, we need to find the row that corresponds to Aniket Dhadphale from the table. This can be done by scanning the \"player\" column for a match with Aniket Dhadphale. In this case, we find him in row 245.\n\n2. Next, we look at the \"nhl team\" column to determine which NHL team Aniket Dhadphale plays for. From row 245, we can see that he plays for the San Jose Sharks.\n\n3. Now, we need to check if the United States is listed as his nationality in the table since the claim states that he is from the United States. To do this, we look at the \"nationality\" column for row 245. From our observations, his nationality is indeed listed as the United States.\n\nWith these three steps, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 245,\n    \"column_name\": \"player\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 245,\n    \"column_name\": \"nhl team\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 245,\n    \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n  }\n]\n\nThe final answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.

Find the row corresponding to Mark Polak in the table: Since the claim mentions Mark Polak, we start by locating his information in the table. We find him on row index 251.\n3. Check the position column for Mark Polak: To verify if Mark Polak is a centre, we look at the position column (column 4) of the row where he appears (row index 251).\n4. Check the pick column for Mark Polak: Next, to see if Mark Polak has a pick of 260, we check the pick column (column 1) of the same row where he appears (row index 251).\n5.
