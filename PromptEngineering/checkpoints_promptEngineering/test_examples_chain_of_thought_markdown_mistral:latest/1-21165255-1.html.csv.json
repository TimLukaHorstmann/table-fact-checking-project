Locate the corresponding row in the table that has the row_index as 62. The cell of interest here is the one with column name 'no in season'.\n\n3. Read the value from the identified cell to find the season number for the given episode, which should be found in the 'no in season' column for row index 62.\n\n4. Compare the found season number with the expected season number provided in the claim (19).\n\nWith this reasoning process, we can now output the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row number for which we need to find the season number.\",\n    \"Locate the corresponding row in the table that has the row_index as the identified row number.\",\n    \"Read the value from the cell of interest, which is the one with column name 'no in season' for the identified row.\",\n    \"Compare the found season number with the expected season number provided in the claim.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 62,\n      \"column_name\": \"no in season\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
