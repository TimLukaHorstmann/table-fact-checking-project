Check the column named \"series\" for this row, which contains the series score (1 - 3 in this case).\n3. Compare the series score found in step 2 with the claim's expected series score (1 - 4).\n\nThe claim is comparing game 4 and the series score at that point. Since the table shows that game 4 took place on April 25, and the series score at that time was indeed 1 - 3, we can see that the claim \"game 4.0, series 1 - 4 be on april 25\" is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON format for the output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify game 4 by its row index.\",\n    \"Check the 'series' column in the identified row to get series score (1 - 3).\",\n    \"Compare the series score with the expected series score in the claim.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"series\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
