Finally, we need to determine the team's record based on the score from game 44. The 'record' column shows the win-loss-tie record for each team at the end of each month.

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. First, we identify the row corresponding to the Boston Bruins game (row 5 in the table). The game number for this row is 47.\n2. We then check if there's another row with a game number greater than or equal to 47 (in this case, only one more row with game number 48 exists).\n3. In that new row (row 6), we look at the \"score\" column which shows the score of the Boston Bruins in their 48th game. Since the value is '0 - 0 ot', it implies that the game was a tie or overtime, and no official win or loss is recorded for the team.\n4. The \"record\" column shows the total number of wins, losses, and ties up to the point before the most recent game. In this case, it indicates '27 - 11 - 9' before the 48th game.\n5. Since we have observed that a tie or overtime was played in the 48th game (which is not reflected in the record), we know that after accounting for the result of the 48th game, the updated total wins for Boston Bruins should be '27' + (number of wins from the 48th game which is currently unknown) and other stats should adjust accordingly.\n6. As a result, if we were to add the number of wins from the 48th game (which we do not know at this moment), the record would be updated. Since we don't have information on the outcome of the 48th game, it is impossible to confirm whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE at this point.\n\nThe final answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row corresponding to Boston Bruins' 48th game\",\n    \"Check if there are more rows with a game number greater than or equal to 47\",\n    \"Examine the score and record columns for the relevant row\",\n    \"Determine that the outcome of the 48th game is not reflected in the current data\",\n    \"Recognize that the updated record would change based on the outcome of the 48th game\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"INSUFFICIENT_DATA\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}",
