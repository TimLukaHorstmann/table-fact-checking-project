From the table, we see that Terry Austin, Colin Russell, Brian Stanton, and Kevin Stonehouse are listed as forwards.\n3. Next, we need to check how many of these forwards played during the 1982-82 season. To do this, we will look at the 'total apps' column, which represents total appearances in all competitions.\n4. By counting the number of appearances (excluding parentheses if any) for each forward, we find that Terry Austin has 4 appearances, Colin Russell has 49 appearances, Brian Stanton has 50 appearances, and Kevin Stonehouse has 5 appearances.\n5. Summing up these appearance numbers, we get a total of 4 + 49 + 50 + 5 = 108 appearances.\n6. Since all four forwards played during the 1982-82 season, we can say that they played together during that particular season.\n7.
