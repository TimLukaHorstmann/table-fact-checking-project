To do this, we look for drivers who have a constructor listed as \"tyrrell - ford\". In our table, there are two such drivers: Mika Salo and Jos Verstappen.\n\n2. Next, we check if these two drivers are the ones mentioned in the claim. The claim states that both Mika Salo and Jos Verstappen were driving for Tyrrell - Ford cars. Since we've identified both of them as drivers of a Tyrrell - Ford car, our hypothesis is that they did indeed compete with Tyrrell - Ford cars.\n\n3. To validate this hypothesis, we don't need to look at any other cells in the table because we have found the necessary information in just one cell (the constructor column for Mika Salo and Jos Verstappen).\n\nNow, let's present the answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify drivers who were competing with Tyrrell - Ford cars.

Since both drivers completed the same number of laps and neither retired, the race finish order is determined by their grid positions (lower grid position means earlier start and potentially better chance to finish ahead).\n5.
