The Notre Dame Basilica has the earliest start year (1829) and the latest end year (1928). No other building in the table has years that overlap this time frame.\n\n2. Next, we check if there are any buildings with a greater height within the given time frame. The height is provided in both meters and feet. We convert all heights to meters for comparison purposes. To do this, we divide the feet by 3.28084 (1 foot = 0.3048 meters).\n\n   Notre Dame Basilica: 69 / 226 = 69 * 0.3048 = 20.757 m\n\n   No other building has a height less than or equal to 20.757 meters during the time frame of 1829 to 1928.\n\n3. Finally, we confirm that the Notre Dame Basilica had the most years as the tallest building from 1829 to 1928. The number of years as the tallest is provided in the \"years as tallest\" column. The Notre Dame Basilica has 99 years, which is greater than any other building's duration as the tallest.\n\nIn summary:\n- The Notre Dame Basilica was the tallest building from 1829 to 1928.\n- No other building during that time frame had a height less than or equal to the Notre Dame Basilica's height.\n- The Notre Dame Basilica had more years as the tallest building compared to any other building.\n\nThe final answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify buildings with start and end years between 1829 - 1928\",\n    \"Compare heights of identified buildings during the given time frame\",\n    \"Confirm which building had the most years as the tallest\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"height m / ft\" }\n  ]\n}",

Compare the number of floors for each building: both buildings have 47 floors according to the table.\n4. Determine the height difference between the two buildings when Tour de la Bourse took the title of tallest building from Place Ville Marie:\n   - Height difference is provided in the claim as 6/20 meters or approximately 0.3 meters (or 1 foot) in height.\n5. Check if this height difference is valid considering the timeline when each building was considered tallest:\n   - The table shows that during the period of time when Place Ville Marie was considered tallest, it stood at a height of 188/617 meters (or approximately 12 stories less than Tour de la Bourse).\n6. Confirm if the new height of Place Ville Marie after the title change could be 12 stories lower (or approximately 36.5 meters, or 122 feet - 188/617 * 12) and still leave a difference of 0.3 meters (or 1 foot) with Tour de la Bourse:\n   - 188/617 * 12 = 115.9 m, which is close to 115.5 m if rounded down to the nearest whole meter. This value is not exactly equal to the original height of Place Ville Marie minus 12 floors (which would be approximately 171.5 m), but it is a reasonable assumption considering that heights may not be always perfectly accurate in the table.\n7. Since it is reasonable to assume that the height difference between Place Ville Marie and Tour de la Bourse remained relatively consistent during this period, we can conclude that Tour de la Bourse took the title of tallest building from Place Ville Marie in 1964 by a height difference of approximately 0.3 meters (or 1 foot).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the buildings involved in the claim\",\n    \"Determine the years when each building was considered tallest\",\n    \"Compare the number of floors for each building\",\n    \"Determine the height difference between the two buildings when Tour de la Bourse took the title of tallest building from Place Ville Marie\",\n    \"Check if this height difference is valid considering the timeline when each building was considered tallest\",\n    \"Confirm if the new height of Place Ville Marie after the title change could be 12 stories lower and still leave a difference of 0.3 meters with Tour de la Bourse\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"height m / ft\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"height m / ft\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"height m / ft\" }\n  ]\n}",
