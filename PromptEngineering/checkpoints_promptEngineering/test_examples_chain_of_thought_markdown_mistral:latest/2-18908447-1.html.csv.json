    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the specific player we are looking for in the table: Jim Obradovich.\n2. Find out his pick number to determine whether it falls within the specified range (before pick 183 but after round 2).\n3. Look for Jim Obradovich's row in the table, and extract the \"pick\" value from that row.\n4. Compare the extracted pick value with the given conditions:\n   - The number is greater than or equal to 27 (the player picked in round 2) because we want picks made after round 2.\n   - The number is strictly less than 183, to ensure that the pick falls before pick 183.\n5. If the extracted pick value satisfies both conditions, then the claim is true. Otherwise, it is false.\n\nRelevant cells:\n- [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}] - This cell contains the pick number of Jim Obradovich, which we'll use for comparison.\n- [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"}] - This cell tells us the position of Jim Obradovich. We compare this with the required position in the claim later on.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Identify the player and his position, pick number from table.\\n2. Check if pick number is greater than or equal to the pick made in round 2 (27).\\n3. Check if pick number is strictly less than 183.\\n4.

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the relevant columns for determining the claim: pick and position (since the claim mentions a pick number and a position).\n2. Determine the row corresponding to Jim Obradovich by looking up his name in the table. We find him in row 5, with a pick value of 158 and position \"tight end\".\n3. Observe that the pick value for Jim Obradovich is 158 which is greater than 2 (round 2). This means Jim Obradovich was picked after round 2.\n4. However, the claim also mentions that he plays the tight end position. The position listed for Jim Obradovich is indeed \"tight end\".\n5. Since Jim Obradovich was picked in a round greater than 2 but his position matches what's specified in the claim, we cannot conclude whether he was picked before round 2 or not based on the information provided. However, it is clear that he was picked as a tight end.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify relevant columns: pick and position\", \"Find row for Jim Obradovich\", \"Observe pick value and position\", \"Compare pick value with round 2\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"position\"}]\n}",
