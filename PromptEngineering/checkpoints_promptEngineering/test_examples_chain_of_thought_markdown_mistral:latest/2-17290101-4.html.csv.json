Since there are only two players with scores that add up to 139 (71 + 68 = 139 for Billy Casper and 69 + 71 = 140 for Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, Ben Hogan), it seems likely that the claim is not true as there are more than two players with a score of 139.\n  2. However, we need to note that the scores listed in the table are not necessarily final. The \"+ 1\" or \"+ 2\" next to some players' scores indicate that they might have penalties added to their total score. Therefore, it is possible that after adjusting for these penalties, Billy Casper's score might not be exactly 139 anymore.\n  3. Check the table again to find out if Ernie Vossler or Dow Finsterwald have any penalties (indicated by \"+ X\" next to their scores).\n  4. If neither Ernie Vossler nor Dow Finsterwald has a penalty, then our initial assumption that there are more than two players with a score of 139 is incorrect, and the claim is true. However, if either one of them has a penalty, we would need to adjust their scores accordingly and compare their new adjusted scores with other players to determine whether they are still the only ones with a score of 139 or not.\n  5. In this case, there are no penalties for Ernie Vossler or Dow Finsterwald. So let's check the relevant cells:\n       - Billy Casper (row_index=1, column_name=\"score\") = \"71 + 68\"\n       - Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, Ben Hogan (rows t2, score) = \"71 + 69\"\n  6. Adjust Billy Casper's score by adding the par value (which is given as 1). His new adjusted score would be 71 + 68 + 1 = 140.\n  7. Now compare Billy Casper's adjusted score with Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, and Ben Hogan's scores: their scores are all 140. Since Ernie Vossler and Dow Finsterwald have a score of 142 before adjusting for penalties, they no longer meet the requirement of having a score equal to or less than 139.\n  8.
