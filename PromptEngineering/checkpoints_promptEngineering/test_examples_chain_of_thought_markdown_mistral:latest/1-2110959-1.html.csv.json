Each row represents a different season for a team, with columns for games played, wins, losses, ties, points, win percentage (pct %), goals scored (goals for) and goals conceded (goals against). The team's standing is also provided at the end of each row.\n\n2. Next, I need to identify how the win percentage (pct %) is calculated. Since it's a decimal value, we can assume that it represents the ratio of wins to total games played for each season (wins/games).\n\n3. To determine whether the claim is true or false, I will compare the win percentages from all seasons and find the smallest value. In this table, the lowest win percentage can be found in the 1950-51 season with a value of 0.491 (row_index = 4).\n\n4. Finally, I will compare this smallest value with the value provided in the claim for the 1958-59 season (769), which is significantly different from 0.491.\n\nSince the win percentage given in the claim does not match any of the values in the table, my final answer would be:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Understand table structure\", \"Identify how pct % is calculated\", \"Compare all pct % values to find the smallest\", \"Compare the smallest value with the one provided in the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pct %\"}]\n}",
