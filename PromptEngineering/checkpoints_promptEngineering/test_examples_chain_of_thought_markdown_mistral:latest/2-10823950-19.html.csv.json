Assuming this is indeed an error and one of these games should actually have been played on August 9, we will continue the analysis with the available data: all the matches took place on August 8, 1981.\n3. To evaluate the claim, we need to find out which team had the largest away attendance for a game on that date. We do this by looking at the \"crowd\" column and comparing values between teams that played as an away team (essendon, collingwood, st kilda, hawthorn, carlton).\n4. We then compare the crowds for each of these teams:\n   - Essendon had a crowd of 15,411\n   - Collingwood had a crowd of 21,237 (the largest so far)\n   - St Kilda had a crowd of 15,943\n   - Hawthorn had a crowd of 8058 (smaller than the current maximum)\n   - Carlton had a crowd of 24,287 (which exceeds the current maximum)\n\nSince Carlton has a larger attendance than Collingwood, they are the team with the largest away attendance on August 8, 1981.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify games played on August 8, 1981\", \"Check which teams played as an away team\", \"Compare crowds of the respective teams to determine the largest attendance for an away game\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}]\n}",
