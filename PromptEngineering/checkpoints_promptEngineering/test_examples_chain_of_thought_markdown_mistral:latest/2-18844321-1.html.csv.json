Count the matches that occurred in November and December: There are 7 matches in November and 6 matches in December (wales to scotland not included because it's a test match).\n6.

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, identify all the teams that played against Cambridge University (as indicated by the \"against\" column). This includes Cambridge University itself, as it's considered a single team playing two matches, but for our purposes we will consider both games separate. So the teams to look at are: Cambridge University (row 1), West Wales XV (row 3), London Counties (row 5), Munster (row 6), England (row 11).\n2. Then, check the \"score\" column for matches against Cambridge University for each of these teams. Since there's no explicit score column in the table, we need to infer the scores from the numbers that appear under the \"against\" column for each match where Cambridge University is the opposing team. In this case, the number represents the points scored by Cambridge University against the given team.\n3. From the table, we can see that the scores are as follows: 12 (Cambridge University vs itself in game 2), 7 (vs West Wales XV), 12 (vs London Counties), 12 (vs Munster), and 6 (vs England). Only two teams scored exactly 12 points against Cambridge University: London Counties and Munster.\n4. However, since Cambridge University is playing twice (once as the home team and once as the away team), it should not be considered twice when looking for teams that scored exactly 12 against Cambridge University. Therefore, the correct number of teams scoring exactly 12 points against Cambridge University is 2 - 1 (since we counted Cambridge University itself twice).\n5. Finally, check that the answer matches the claim. Since there are 2 teams that score exactly 12 against Cambridge University after accounting for Cambridge University playing twice, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe final JSON output would look like this:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify teams playing against Cambridge University\",\n    \"Check scores of these teams against Cambridge University\",\n    \"Infer scores from numbers under 'against' column for matches where Cambridge is the opposing team\",\n    \"Account for Cambridge University playing twice\",\n    \"Check that answer matches claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opposing team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opposing team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opposing team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opposing team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opposing team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
