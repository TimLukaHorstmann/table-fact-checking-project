Next, we look through the table to find the highest 'point score' or win by a team in a single game. To do this, we check for rows where the first column (tie no) is not \"replay\", because replay games are extensions of earlier matches and don't represent individual game results.\n3. In our table, we find multiple draws (1 point for each team), but no clear winner with 3 points (a win). However, one team, leek town, did have a 'score' of 4 - 0 in the replay against chester city.

Since there is no score given for the replay of the Fulham vs. Cambridge United match (row 9), we cannot definitively say if it's the highest scoring shutout game.
