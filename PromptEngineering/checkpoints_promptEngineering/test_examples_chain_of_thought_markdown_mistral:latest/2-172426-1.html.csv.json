Check the column \"name dates\" to find out when she was born and when she became a princess royal. In this case, she was born in 1897 and became a princess royal in 1932.\n   3. To see if she married before the age of 12, we need the information about her marriage date and husband. These can be found in the columns \"date married\" and \"husband dates\". In this case, Mary was married to henry Lascelles (row 6) on 1922.\n   4. To check if Mary married before she was 12, subtract 12 from the year of her marriage. In this case, that would be 1922 - 12 = 1910.\n   5. Since the age of princess Mary at the time of her marriage (1910) is greater than 12, it indicates that she did not marry before the age of 12.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify row corresponding to princess Mary\", \"Check 'name dates' for birth and becoming a princess royal\", \"Find husband and marriage date\", \"Calculate age at marriage\", \"Compare calculated age with 12\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date married\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"}]\n}",

In row 7, she has the title \"princess royal\" from 1950 to the present, and there are two dates under the column \"name dates\". This indicates that Princess Anne is still holding the title as of the current date (implied).\n\n2. Check if there are multiple entries for her husband(s) in the table. We can find her husband information in rows 6, 7, and 8, since they have a column \"husband dates\". If there were two different individuals with husband dates, it would indicate that she had two husbands.\n\n3. Analyze each of the husbands' date ranges:\n   - In row 6, we see Henry Lascelles, 6th earl of Harewood, with a date range of 1882 - 1947. This indicates that he passed away before Princess Anne was even born (as she was born in 1950).\n   - In row 7, we see Mark Phillips with no defined end date, but the start date is given as 1973 - 1992. Since this time period includes part of Princess Anne's title period (from 1987 to present), it suggests that they were married during this period.\n   - In row 8, we see Sir Timothy Laurence with a start date of 1992, which is after the end of Mark Phillips' marriage to Princess Anne (1992). This indicates that Sir Timothy Laurence is her second husband, if we consider their marriages chronologically.\n\n4. Based on our analysis, it appears that Princess Anne has two husbands in a chronological sense: Mark Phillips and Sir Timothy Laurence.
