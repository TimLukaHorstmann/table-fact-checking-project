Next, we check if the ensign appeared continuously from 1973 to 1982 by examining the 'year' column. Although some years (1975-1977 and 1979-1980) have more than one entry for the car, there are gaps in the sequence of years where the car is not present (1974, 1978, and 1981).\n\n3. Finally, we confirm that the ensign raced in F1 cars by observing that all the entries have 'f' or 'g' for tyres, which are typically used in F1 races. However, even though the ensign raced in F1 cars, it did not appear continuously from 1973 through 1982. Hence, the claim is false.",

The earliest and latest years with 'ensign' in the chassis column are 1973 and 1982. We can consider a timeframe of 6 consecutive years starting from 1975 (since there is no 1974 entry for ensign) and ending in 1980.\n2. The relevant rows for our selected car model are:\n   - row_index: 3, column_name: chassis ('ensign n174 ensign n175')\n   - row_index: 4, column_name: chassis ('ensign n174 ensign n176')\n   - row_index: 5, column_name: chassis ('ensign n177')\n   - row_index: 6, column_name: chassis ('ensign n177')\n   - row_index: 7, column_name: chassis ('ensign n177 ensign n179')\n   - row_index: 8, column_name: chassis ('ensign n177 ensign n180')\n   - row_index: 9, column_name: chassis ('ensign n180')\n\n3. The tyres used by this car model consistently during the timeframe are 'g'.\n4. We can see that in the selected timeframe (1975 to 1980), the ensign racing scored points only in two years: 1977 and 1977.\n\nSince the claim required a 6-year run on Goodyear tyres with points being earned in at least 3 of those years, it is FALSE according to this table.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the timeframe for the claim (6 consecutive years)\",\n    \"Find the rows related to the car model mentioned in the claim ('ensign')\",\n    \"Determine if there is consistency in tyre types during the selected timeframe\",\n    \"Check if points were scored within the 6-year period\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"chassis\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"tyres\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"chassis\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tyres\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"chassis\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"tyres\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"chassis\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tyres\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"chassis\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"tyres\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"chassis\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"tyres\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"chassis\" }\n  ]\n}",
