    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the years we are interested in, which is 2009 from the claim.\n2. Scan through the table to find all songs released in 2009. We can see that \"kingdom of rust\", \"winter hill\", and \"andalucia\" were released in 2009.\n3. Count the number of songs released in 2009, which is 3.\n4. Compare this count with the claim: \"in 2009, doves release more than 5 song\". Since there are only 3 songs released in 2009, they did not release more than 5 songs in that year.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the year of interest (2009 from the claim), scan through the table to find all songs released in 2009, count the number of these songs (3), compare this count with the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"release date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"release date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"release date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"release date\" }\n  ]\n}",
