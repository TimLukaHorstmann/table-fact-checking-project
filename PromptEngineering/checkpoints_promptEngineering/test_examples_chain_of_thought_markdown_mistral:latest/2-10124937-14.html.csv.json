    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n   1. Identify the team for which we need to check if the 1st leg score and the 2nd leg score are the same. In this case, it's Bolton Wanderers.\n   2. Locate the row in the table that corresponds to Bolton Wanderers. The row number is easily identifiable as it contains \"bolton wanderers\" in the first column.\n   3. Inspect the 1st leg score for Bolton Wanderers by looking at the cell where the row index is equal to the current one (first row) and the column name is \"1st leg\". The value in this cell is \"1 - 2\".\n   4. Now, inspect the 2nd leg score for Bolton Wanderers by looking at the cell where the row index is equal to the current one (first row) and the column name is \"2nd leg\". The value in this cell is also \"1 - 2\".\n   5. Compare the values obtained in steps 3 and 4. If they are equal, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false. In this case, the 1st leg score (1 - 2) is equal to the 2nd leg score (1 - 2), so the claim is true.\n\n   Final answer:\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\n       \"Identify the team for which we need to check if the scores are the same.\",\n       \"Locate the row in the table that corresponds to the given team\",\n       \"Inspect the 1st leg score for the current team\",\n       \"Now, inspect the 2nd leg score for the current team\",\n       \"Compare the values obtained from steps 3 and 4\"\n     ],\n     \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\" },\n       { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\" }\n     ]\n   }",
