Since the claim is about a match in the 2008 belarusian premier league, we will focus on the rows where 'agg' matches with one of these tournaments.\n\n2. Filter out the irrelevant rows: We filter out all the rows that do not belong to the 2008 belarusian premier league (i.e., the rows where tournament name is not \"2008 uefa intertoto cup\"). This leaves us with the first round, second round, and first qualifying round of the 2008 - 09 uefa cup.\n\n3. Find matches in the filtered set: Now we look for matches where 'agg' is 4-1.

The table shows that cracovia vs shakhtyor soligorsk and sturm graz vs shakhtyor soligorsk took place in the first round of this competition.\n\n3. Compare the goal scores: According to the table, the score for the match between cracovia and shakhtyor soligorsk was 1 - 5, while the score for sturm graz vs shakhtyor soligorsk was 0 - 2. Since the claim is about the highest goal scored by shakhtyor soligorsk in the first round of the 2008 uefa intertoto cup, we compare the total goals scored by shakhtyor soligorsk in each match. In this case, shakhtyor soligorsk scored 5 goals against cracovia and 2 goals against sturm graz.\n\n4.
