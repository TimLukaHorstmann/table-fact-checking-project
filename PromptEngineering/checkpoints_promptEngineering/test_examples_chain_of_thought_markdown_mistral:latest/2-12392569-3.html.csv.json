First, we will check if there are any bronze medals awarded to either the United Kingdom or Canada in the table.\n   4. To do that, we look at the \"bronze\" column for rows corresponding to these two nations (United Kingdom and Canada).\n   5. If there is a positive number in the \"bronze\" column for any of these two rows, then it would mean one or more bronze medals were won by either of these countries.\n   6. Let's see if we find 1 as the count in the \"bronze\" column for either the United Kingdom or Canada:\n      - For the United Kingdom, there is no value in the \"bronze\" column (row_index=9), indicating they did not win any bronze medals.\n      - For Canada (row_index=8), there is a value of 1 in the \"bronze\" column, which means they won 1 bronze medal.\n   7.
