Check for rows where the opponent scored goals (rows with a result other than \"win\" or \"draw\").

The eleventh and twelfth rows (rows 10 and 11) both have a win result, so they are not relevant.\n9. The thirteenth row (row index: 12) has a draw result and a zero score in the score column. This game meets our criteria of having a zero point score and ending in a draw.\n10. Finally, we find another instance in the eighteenth row (row index: 17), which also matches our criteria.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that there are at least two games (thirteenth and eighteenth rows) with a total of zero point score and ending in a draw.\n\nHere is the final JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find games where score equals 0 and result is a draw\",\n    \"Examine each row that has 'draw' in the result column and check if the score column also has 0 for that particular game\",\n    \"Start from the top of the table and work our way down\",\n    \"Check all rows until finding matches or reaching the end\",\n    \"Record the relevant games with their row indexes\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
