To do this, we need to look for the \"previous conference\" column and compare it with the \"conference\" that the schools joined later (either calumet or independent in our table).\n\n2. Check the rows that have the Calumet Conference as their current conference or previous conference. These are the schools that we should focus on since the claim is about being a part of the Calumet conference before joining.\n\n3. Examine the \"year joined\" column to determine when each school first became a member of their current conference.\n\n4. Based on this information, we can find out if any school was previously part of the Calumet Conference by comparing the year they joined with other conferences and their \"previous conference\".\n\n5. Compare the years when each school joined its current conference with the year the Calumet Conference was formed (1970). If a school joined the Calumet Conference after 1970, then it could not have been part of this conference before joining. Conversely, if a school joined the Calumet Conference prior to 1970, then it is likely that it had been previously a part of the Calumet Conference.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relevant cells and output our final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the conferences each school was previously a part of before joining.\",\n    \"Focus on the schools that were part of the Calumet conference or joined it after its formation in 1970.\",\n    \"Examine the 'year joined' column to determine when each school first became a member of their current conference.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"conference\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"year joined\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"conference\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, there are two schools (Chesterton and Portage) that were previously part of the Calumet Conference before joining since they are currently in the Calumet Conference and joined before 1970. The other school, Crown Point, joined after 1970 so it cannot be considered as having been a member of the Calumet Conference before joining.",
