This will give us potential candidate countries for the latest expansion.\n3. Compare the years in which Carrefour entered these potential candidate countries to determine if there are any ties or if one year is later than the others. Since the claim mentions \"the most recent market expand\", we are looking for the country where Carrefour opened its store last.\n\nBased on the table provided, the relevant rows (countries where Carrefour first opened a store) are: France (1960), Greece (1991), Albania (2011), Bulgaria (2009), Macedonia (2012), Georgia (2012), Italy (1993), Spain (1973), Turkey (1993), and Cyprus (2006). Comparing the years, we see that both Georgia and Macedonia opened their first Carrefour store in 2012. However, since the claim is asking for \"the most recent market expand,\" we need to look for the country where Carrefour entered after these two countries.\n\nThe 'first store' column shows us the year of the first store opening for each country.
