Identify the relevant rows: We need to find the row that corresponds to 'sewda'. In this table, the row index for 'sewda' is 20.\n\n3.

Compare the data: To check if 'sewda' has the second lowest number of electorates, we need to find a constituency with a lower number of electorates. If no other constituency has a lower number, then 'sewda' does not have the second lowest number and thus the claim is false.\n\n5. Scan the table: We scan the rest of the rows (excluding the total row) to find a constituency with a lower number of electorates. The next row we encounter after 'sewda' is for 'bhander', which has 139600 electorates (row_index=21). This means that at least one constituency (namely, 'bhander') has a higher number of electorates than 'sewda'.\n\n6.
