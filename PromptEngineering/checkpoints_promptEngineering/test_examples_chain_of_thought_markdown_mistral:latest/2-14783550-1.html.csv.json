The relevant cells for China are row 1 with columns \"gold\", \"silver\", \"bronze\", and \"total\", and for Thailand, they are in row 5.\n   2. From the table, we can see that China won a total of 53 medals, while Thailand won a total of 11 medals.\n   3. To determine whether Hong Kong (HKG) has won more than 11 total medals (Thailand's total), we need to find the total number of medals Hong Kong won and compare it with Thailand's total. The relevant cell for Hong Kong is in row 4 with the \"total\" column.\n   4. From the table, we can see that Hong Kong won a total of 15 medals.\n   5. Comparing the number of medals won by China (53) and Thailand (11), we know that Hong Kong (15) has indeed won more than Thailand (11).\n   6. To answer the original claim, we compare the total medals won by each country in the specified sport (wushu). The total number of medals won by China is not explicitly given for wushu, but since it includes all medals and they have more than Thailand's total, it can be inferred that China has also won more medals in wushu.\n   7. Therefore, Hong Kong has indeed won 4 more total medals (than Thailand) for wushu, as the table only presents data for one sport, but since they have won more total medals than Thailand overall, it can be reasonably assumed that they have also won more medals in wushu.\n\nThe final answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the total number of medals for China and Thailand.\",\n    \"Compare the total number of medals won by each country.\",\n    \"Check if Hong Kong has more than Thailand's total number of medals.\",\n    \"Infer that since Hong Kong has a higher overall medal count, they likely have more wushu medals as well.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\" }\n  ]\n}",
