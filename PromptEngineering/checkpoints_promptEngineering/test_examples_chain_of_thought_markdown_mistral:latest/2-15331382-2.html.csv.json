In the table, the week number corresponds to the leftmost column. Thus, the week number for this game is 11.\n2. Check all other games' attendance numbers in the table to find the lowest value. The table lists games from week 1 to week 17. Since there are no entries for weeks with numbers less than or equal to 11 (as our game of interest is in week 11), we only need to compare the game attendance numbers from week 12 onwards, as they represent higher points in the season when more fans may have attended games.\n3. Compare the attendance number for the game on November 21, 2004 (row index 10) with the attendance numbers for all other games in weeks 12 to 17 (rows 12-17). In this case, the attendance number for the game on November 21, 2004 is 46905. Compare it with the attendance numbers for the remaining games:\n   - Week 12: Kansas City Chiefs - 77447\n   - Week 13: Denver Broncos - 65395\n   - Week 14: Tampa Bay Buccaneers - 65858\n   - Week 15: Cleveland Browns - 72489\n   - Week 16: Indianapolis Colts - 57330\n   - Week 17: Kansas City Chiefs (again) - 64920\n\n4.

If we find a lower attendance value, then our claim is true; if not, our claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells:\n- { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" } (november 28, 2004 game's attendance)\n- All other rows in the table with the \"attendance\" column (to compare against the November 28 game's attendance)\n\n   Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim's condition: Check if the game on November 28, 2004 has the least amount of crowd attendance\",\n    \"Iterate through each row in the table excluding the header row\",\n    \"Compare the 'attendance' column value for the given date ('november 28 , 2004') with every other 'attendance' value\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" }\n  ]\n}",
