Next, we need to identify the row where the average vote per candidate is 1416:\n   - The relevant row for the average vote per candidate 1416 is the fifth row since it has a value of 1416 in the \"average votes per candidate\" column.\n\n3. Now, we need to find the corresponding value for the average % of total vote per candidate in this row:\n   - The corresponding value for the average % of total vote per candidate in the fifth row is 3.29, which can be found in the \"average % of vote per candidate\" column of the fifth row.\n\n4. Lastly, we compare the calculated value with the given claim to determine if it's true or false:\n   - The given claim is that the average % of vote per candidate be 3.29% when the average vote per candidate be 1416.
