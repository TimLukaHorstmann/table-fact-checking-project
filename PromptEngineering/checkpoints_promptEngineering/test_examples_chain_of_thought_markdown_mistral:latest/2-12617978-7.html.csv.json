From the table, we see that the episode 3 involves only two people: James Seddon (the entrepreneur) and Richard Farleigh (one of the dragons). This means that Richard Farleigh was present in this episode.\n   3. To check if he was the only dragon to investigate in this episode, we need to verify if there were any other dragons involved but did not investigate (i.e., did not invest) in this particular deal. For this, we would look for other dragons who appear in row_index 3 of the 'investing dragon(s)' column, but their names do not appear anywhere in that row under the 'entrepreneur(s)' column. However, since Richard Farleigh invested in this episode (as shown in the table), we don't need to check for other dragons who did not investigate.\n   4.
