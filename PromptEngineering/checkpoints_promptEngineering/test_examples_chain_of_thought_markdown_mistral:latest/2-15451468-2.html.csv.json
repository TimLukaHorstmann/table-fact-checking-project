The table contains information about each week, including date, opponent, result, game site, attendance.\n2. Look for the maximum value in the \"attendance\" column, which represents the total number of attendees for each game. This is essential as we are comparing different attendance numbers.\n3. Iterate through each row and check the corresponding attendance value.\n4. Compare the current attendance value with the previously found maximum attendance. If the current one is larger, update the maximum value.\n5. Once you have checked all rows, compare the maximum value with the number provided in the claim (62936). If they are the same, the claim is true. Otherwise, the claim is false.\n\nIn this case, let's check the table:\n- Row 1 attendance: 62936\n- No other attendance values are larger than 62936 (either directly or when compared to previous maximums found).\n\nSo, the claim \"62936 be the highest attendance for the whole week\" is TRUE.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"1.
