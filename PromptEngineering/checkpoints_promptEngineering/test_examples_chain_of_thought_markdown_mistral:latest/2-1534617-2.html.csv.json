    "resp": "Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the event we are interested in, which is \"autumn gold\".\n2. Find the corresponding results for each year from the table. The year we are interested in is 2011 - 12, so we look at the column labelled \"2011 - 12\".\n3. Observe that the result for \"autumn gold\" in the row labelled \"2011 - 12\" is \"q\".\n4. Compare the observed result with the claim. The claim states that the \"autumn gold grand slam event result was an 'c'\" for the year 2011-12. Since the actual result is not 'c' but 'q', the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's my final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the event: autumn gold\",\n    \"Find the corresponding results for each year from the table\",\n    \"Observe the result for 'autumn gold' in 2011-12 is 'q'\",\n    \"Compare the observed result with the claim\",\n    \"The actual result is not 'c', but 'q'\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"2011 - 12\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
