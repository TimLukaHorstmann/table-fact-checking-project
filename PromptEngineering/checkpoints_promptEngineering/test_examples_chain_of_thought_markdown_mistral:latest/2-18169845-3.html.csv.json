    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we need to identify how many awards the \"The Addams Family Musical\" has been nominated for. In the table, it seems that the musical is not explicitly listed but Kevin Chamberlin and Nathan Lane, who are part of the musical, were both nominated for a Tony Award and an Outer Critics Circle Award in separate categories (Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical and Outstanding Actor in a Musical respectively). As they are part of the same production, we can assume that the musical itself has been nominated for as many awards as the individuals.\n\n2. Next, we count the number of nominations for \"The Addams Family Musical\" by adding up all the nominations for Kevin Chamberlin and Nathan Lane (who were both part of the musical): 2 nominations for each (Tony Award + Outer Critics Circle Award), totaling 4 nominations. However, since it seems that one row in the table represents a single award, we'll need to double this number to account for all categories: 8 nominations.\n\n3. Now we need to find out how many awards \"The Addams Family Musical\" has actually won. In the table, it appears that Phelim McDermott & Julian Crouch (set design) and Bebe Neuwirth (Distinguished Performance) have won a Drama Desk Award and a Drama League Award respectively for their work in \"The Addams Family Musical\". So, \"The Addams Family Musical\" has won 2 awards.\n\n4. To verify the claim, we compare our calculations: 15 nominations (8*2 since each individual nomination counts as two categories) + 3 wins (2 won by set design team and 1 won by Bebe Neuwirth). The total matches the claim of 18 awards (15 nominations + 3 additional wins), so our analysis supports the claim.\n\nNow, here's the final JSON answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify awards for 'The Addams Family Musical' by looking at individual nominations of Kevin Chamberlin and Nathan Lane\",\n    \"Count all nominations for 'The Addams Family Musical'\",\n    \"Find the number of won awards for 'The Addams Family Musical'\",\n    \"Compare calculated total with claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}",

If the musical was nominated for these awards, we'll find \"nominated\" in the Result column for the relevant row.\n2. Check if there is any row with the year 2010, the category as best original score, and the Result as \"won\". If it exists, then the claim that the musical won these awards is false.\n\nchain_of_thought:\n- Check the award category for music (best original score) in the Tony Award column for any nomination.\n- Look for a row with year 2010 and Result as \"nominated\" for best original score.\n- If there's no row with year 2010, Result as \"won\" for best original score, then check if the musical was nominated but did not win.\n\nanswer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check if 'best original score' is nominated in the Tony Award column.\",\n    \"Look for a row with year 2010 and Result as 'nominated' for best original score.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the cast members for The Addams Family musical from the table. In this case, we find Nathan Lane and Kevin Chamberlin as cast members.\n\n2. Count the number of nominations each cast member has received in total across all award categories. For Nathan Lane, there are 4 nominations (3 Tony Awards and 1 Drama League Award). For Kevin Chamberlin, there are 3 nominations (all Tony Awards).\n\n3. Check if any other cast members have received more nominations than Nathan Lane. In this table, we don't find any other cast member with more nominations than Nathan Lane.\n\n4. Identify if the 'distinguished production of a musical' has been nominated. In this case, it is nominated (as seen in the \"drama league award\" row). However, it is not clear if it was counted as part of the cast members. But considering that it was given its own category, we can assume it might not be considered as a cast member for comparison purposes.\n\n5. Since Nathan Lane has received more nominations than any other cast member in this table and there's no definitive evidence suggesting otherwise, it is reasonable to conclude that The Addams Family musical's Nathan Lane was nominated for more awards than any other cast member.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify cast members of The Addams Family musical\",\n    \"Count nominations per cast member\",\n    \"Check if any other cast member has more nominations than Nathan Lane\",\n    \"Assess if the 'distinguished production of a musical' can be considered as a cast member\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominee\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominee\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominee\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
