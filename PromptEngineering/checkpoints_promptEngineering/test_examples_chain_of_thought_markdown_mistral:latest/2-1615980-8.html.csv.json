We can assume that the tournaments listed are those the player participated in.\n\n2. Check for wins: Look at the \"wins\" column to find out if the player has won any tournament. In this case, there are no entries in the \"wins\" column.\n\n3. Determine the number of tournaments played: Since we don't know the exact number of tournaments IAN POULTER participated in, we can't verify the claim directly from the table. However, we can see that he has participated in at least 9 (masters tournament), 10 (us open), 13 (the open championship), and 12 (pga championship) events respectively.\n\n4. Conclusion: Given that there are no wins recorded for IAN POULTER and assuming he has played in the mentioned number of tournaments, the claim appears to be TRUE.
