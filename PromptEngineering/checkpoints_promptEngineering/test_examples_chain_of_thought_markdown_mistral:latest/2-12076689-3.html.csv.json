    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Check the table to find a row where the attendance matches the given number (18084). Since we are looking for a game with 18084 attendees, we need to scan the \"attendance\" column for this value.\n2. Locate the corresponding record and score in the same row of the table, as they will give us information about the win-loss status (score and loss columns) and the current record (record column).\n3. Once we have identified the relevant game, compare the current record given in the table to the one given in the claim. If both records match, then the claim is true; if not, the claim is false.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find the row where attendance = 18084\", \"Look for the corresponding score, loss, and record in the same row\", \"Compare the found record to the one given in the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 29,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 29,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 29,\n      \"column_name\": \"loss\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 29,\n      \"column_name\": \"record\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. First, we need to identify the game for May 6th from the table. The opponent for May 6 is Yankees and the score provided for May 6 is not matching with any of the scores in the \"score\" column.\n2. However, if we look at the \"score\" column again more closely, we can see that the format for some rows (like May 5) has a space between the numbers while others (like May 6 and May 7) do not have a space. If we format the score of May 6 similarly (i.e., as \"6 - 1\"), it matches with the score in the table.\n3. So, based on this, we can infer that the game on May 6 was indeed played against the Yankees and the score was 6 - 1, not 9 - 7 as claimed.\n\nHere's the final JSON answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the game for May 6 from the table.\",\n    \"Notice that the format of the scores in some rows is different.
