    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is true or false:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the structure of the table and what each column represents. The columns are \"round\", \"name\", \"position\", \"school\", and \"signed\". The school name indicates where each player goes to college. The \"signed\" column indicates whether a player has signed or not for that college.\n\n2. We are given a claim about the University of Southern California (USC) having no twin from 1967 under the \"signed\" category in their list. To verify this, we need to find the row(s) where the school name is the University of Southern California and the \"signed\" column value is neither yes nor null (as a 'no' or not signing is considered as not being in the list).\n\n3. We then search for the relevant cell(s) in the table, looking for the row with the school name equal to \"University of Southern California\".\n\n4. After examining all rows, we find only one row (row_index=5) where the school name is \"university of southern california\", and the \"signed\" column value is \"no twins - 1967\". This means that the player named John Herbst did not sign with USC in 1967, but there's a note about no twins.\n\n5. Since the \"signed\" column value for John Herbst from USC indicates \"no twins - 1967\", it does not contradict the claim that USC has no twin-1967 listed under the signed category, but also doesn't confirm the claim due to the presence of a note about the absence of twins. However, we can still conclude that the absence of a \"yes\" value in the \"signed\" column for any player from USC supports the claim when considering only players without such notes.\n\nFinally, here is the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Examine table structure to understand its columns and values\",\n    \"Find the relevant cell(s) by searching for the row with the school name equal to 'University of Southern California'\",\n    \"Determine if the 'signed' column value confirms or contradicts the claim based on the absence or presence of 'yes' in the 'signed' column\",\n    \"Conclude that the absence of a 'yes' value in the 'signed' column for any player from USC supports the claim when considering only players without such notes\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"school\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"signed\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
