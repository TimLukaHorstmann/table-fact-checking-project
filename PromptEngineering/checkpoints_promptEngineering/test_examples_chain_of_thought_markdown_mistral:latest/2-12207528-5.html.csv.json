To identify the games played by the Blue Jays, we look for rows where the \"opponent\" column does not contain \"athletics\", \"angels\", \"mariners\", \"royals\", or \"rangers\".

This represents 3 games played against the Royals during the given time frame.\n5. Previously, we counted 16 games played by the Blue Jays against their opponents (athletics, angels, mariners), so to find out how many total games the Blue Jays played in July, we add the number of games they played with other teams (3) to the number of games played with their opponents (16).\n6.
