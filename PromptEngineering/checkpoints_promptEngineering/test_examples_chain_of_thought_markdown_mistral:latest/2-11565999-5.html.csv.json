The song title for this track is in the \"song title\" column. Thus, we look at the value for the \"song title\" column in the 8th row (track 9) and find that it is 'just a little bit'.\n\nSince the given claim matches the value found from the table, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the table containing song information\",\n    \"Find the row in the table corresponding to track 9\",\n    \"Determine the value of the 'song title' column for that row\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"song title\"}\n  ]\n}",

Find the row that corresponds to track number 23 in the table. Since the first row has index 0, we look for the 22nd row (index 21 if counting from 0).\n3. Examine the \"song title\" column of the selected row to determine if it matches the claimed title.\n4.
