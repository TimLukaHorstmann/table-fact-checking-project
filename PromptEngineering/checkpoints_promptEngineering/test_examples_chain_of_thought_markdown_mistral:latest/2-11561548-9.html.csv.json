However, we also note that daedalusx64 is listed under PSP for its current version, but it doesn't specify the platform for its previous versions. Since there's no clear indication that it only runs on PSP and not on either Windows or Xbox, we will consider it as a potential candidate.\n4. Now, let's check if any other emulator shares the same system as these candidates (nintendo 64). The only emulators listed under nintendo 64 are 1964, cen64, daedalusx64, mupen64, mupen64plus, n64js, project64, sixtyforce, and ultrahle.\n5. We already identified 1964, project64, and potentially daedalusx64 as running on both Windows and Xbox. Among the remaining emulators, only cen64 is not listed under either Windows or Xbox, so it can be excluded from consideration.\n6. We now have three emulators (1964, project64, and potentially daedalusx64) that run on both Windows and Xbox.
