Check if the livery in the found row matches the livery provided in the claim (it should be 'ew' or any variant that can be considered equivalent).\n5.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. First, we need to find the rows in the table that match the locomotive classes of ScotRail, which is BR CO - CO class 47. We can see that there are three locomotives with this class (rows 9, 10, and 11).\n2. Next, since we are asked about the livery of ScotRail, we need to look at the 'livery' column for these rows. However, the 'livery' for these locomotives is not BR BO - BO class 20 as stated in the claim.\n3. Since none of the locomotives with BR CO - CO class match the livery described in the claim, we can conclude that the statement \"the description of livery of scotrail be br bo - bo class 20\" is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find rows with BR CO - CO class locomotives\", \"Check the 'livery' column for these rows to see if it matches BR BO - BO class 20\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"livery\"}, {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"livery\"}, {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"livery\"}]\n}",
