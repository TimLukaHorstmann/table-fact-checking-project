    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. Check the table for the row where the place is t6.\n2. Find the columns for player, country, score to par, money.\n3. Determine if the player in t6 is from Australia (as per the claim). Since the player in t6 is Seve Ballesteros and he's not from Australia, this condition of the claim is FALSE.\n4. However, check if the place t6 has a money greater than 17333 and +8 as the to par. For this, compare the total score (in our table, it's 288) with the par value (+8), which means they are over par by 8 strokes. Then, check if the \"money\" column for t6 has a value greater than 17333. In our table, the money for t6 (Seve Ballesteros) is 22000, which is indeed greater than 17333.\n5.
