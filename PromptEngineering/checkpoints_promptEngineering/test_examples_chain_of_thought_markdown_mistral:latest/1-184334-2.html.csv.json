The row with \"s barangay\" as 51 belongs to \"santa cruz\".\n2. Next, we look for the population (2010 census) value of the same row. The population in the \"santa cruz\" row is given as 115747.\n3.

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n   1. Check the table for a row where the area (has) column value is 66.11 (as required by the claim). No such row exists in the table, so first we need to find the nearest value greater than or equal to 66.11. The closest match is intramuros with an area of 67.26.\n   2. Since we have found a match, we can now check if the population (2010 census) for that district matches the value given in the claim (12985).
