Check if there are any other players who have gone to 'apoel fc' in the same transfer window (winter) and from the same country (Portugal). By scanning through the table, we find that \"paulista\" also went to 'kerkyra' in summer and was later transferred to 'wis\u0142akrak\u00f3w' in summer, but no direct transfer to 'apoel fc' is recorded. However, \"paulo costa\" has a row where he is going to 'anorthosis famagusta' during the winter, but with a loan agreement and then later transferred to 'apoel fc'.
