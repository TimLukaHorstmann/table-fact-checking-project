    "resp": "Here are the steps of my reasoning:\n1. First, I look for the row where the opponent is Washington Redskins, as that is the team they played after week 3.\n2. The date for the game against Washington Redskins is October 9, 1960, which can be found in the second column and fourth row of the table.\n3. Comparing this date to the dates of the games before it (weeks 1, 2, and 3), I notice that October 9, 1960 is after the date for week 3.\n4.
