The relevant rows in this case are:\n   - awu (bull), row 1, column \"singular\"\n   - hhampa (wing), row 5, column \"singular\"\n   - lama (lie), row 6, column \"singular\"\n   - hlan\u00e3 (python), row 7, column \"singular\"\n\n3. We compare each of these singular rows with the predicate \"tlanka\". However, none of them match as their plural forms are not \"xweer (a) du\".\n\n4. In conclusion, the claim is FALSE because there is no matching singular form for \"xweer (a) du\" that would result in \"tlanka\" as its plural form.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify subject and predicate\",\n    \"Subject: xweer (a) du, Predicate: tlanka\",\n    \"Since xweera does not have a specific gender, compare with all singular rows without specified gender\",\n    \"Compare each singular row with the predicate but none match as their plural forms are not 'xweer (a) du'\",\n    \"Conclusion: The claim is FALSE\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"singular\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"plural\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"meaning\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"singular\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"plural\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"singular\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"singular\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"singular\"}\n  ]\n}",
