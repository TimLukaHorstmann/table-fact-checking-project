In this case, the fighter's name is not explicitly given but we can identify him by looking at the records (wins and losses). Since he has two wins, one by \"tko (head kick and punches)\" against Paul weremecki and another by \"decision (split)\" against Gary padilla, our focus will be on these rows.\n\n2. Find the row where the fighter won against Paul weremecki to see the method of victory. In this table, the win against Paul weremecki is in the 18th row with the \"method\" column as \"tko (head kick and punches)\".\n\n3. Find the row where the fighter won against Gary padilla to see the method of victory. In this table, the win against Gary padilla is in the 19th row with the \"method\" column as \"decision (split)\".\n\n4. Compare the methods of victory mentioned in steps 2 and 3 to those stated in the claim. The claim mentions that the fighter won against Paul weremecki with the method tko (head kick and punches) and won against Gary padilla with the method decision (split). From our table analysis, we find that both conditions are indeed true.\n\n5.
