Find the row corresponding to the date November 17: In the table, look for the row where the 'date' column matches 'november 17'. The matching row is row 8.\n\n3. Check if the team playing at home on that day is New Jersey: In the eighth row, the 'home' column indicates 'new jersey'. This confirms that a game played by New Jersey occurred on November 17.\n\n4. Check if the team they were playing against on that day was Philadelphia: In the eighth row, the 'visitor' column does not indicate 'philadelphia'. However, since the home team is New Jersey, their opponent would be listed as the visitor. To find out who the opponent was, we check the previous game played by the visiting team (since the opponent changes with each game) and see if they had a match against Philadelphia on November 17. In the seventh row, it shows that New Jersey played Philadelphia on November 16, so on November 17, the visitor would be playing at home, which is Philadelphia based on our analysis of the home team being New Jersey.\n\n5. Confirm if the attendance on that day was 19621: In the eighth row, the 'attendance' column indicates '19621'.
