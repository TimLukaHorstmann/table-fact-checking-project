Next, we want to find the row corresponding to the school year 2004 - 05. The first row indicates the school year from 1988 - 89.

The row with the index 16 represents the school year 2004 - 05.\n\n3. Finally, we compare the name of class a in the row with index 16 with the given claim \"garden city\".
