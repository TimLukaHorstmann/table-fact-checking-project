    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine the validity of the claim:\n\n1. First, we need to find the venue for each match in the table and compare them.\n2. Then, for each venue found, we will look up the crowd size to compare them.\n3. After comparing all venues' crowd sizes, we can determine which one had the biggest crowd.\n4. If that venue is Victoria Park, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\nNow, let's find the relevant cells and their values for each step:\n\n1. We need to look at the \"venue\" column:\n   - row 1: Brunswick Street Oval\n   - row 2: Windy Hill\n   - row 3: Victoria Park\n   - row 4: Punt Road Oval\n   - row 5: Kardinia Park\n   - row 6: Lake Oval\n\n2. Next, we will look at the \"crowd\" column for each venue found:\n   - row 1 (Brunswick Street Oval): 18544\n   - row 2 (Windy Hill): 27283\n   - row 3 (Victoria Park): 27419\n   - row 4 (Punt Road Oval): 23200\n   - row 5 (Kardinia Park): 26523\n   - row 6 (Lake Oval): 22850\n\n3. Compare the crowd size for each venue:\n   - Victoria Park (row 3) has a higher crowd size (27419) than Brunswick Street Oval (row 1, 18544), Windy Hill (row 2, 27283), Punt Road Oval (row 4, 23200), Kardinia Park (row 5, 26523), and Lake Oval (row 6, 22850)\n\n4.
