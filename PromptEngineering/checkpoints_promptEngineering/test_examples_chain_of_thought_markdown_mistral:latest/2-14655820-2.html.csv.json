Look for the opponent and venue that appear only once in the table (as this would indicate a unique match where the highest attendance might have occurred).\n4. Compare the attendances for these specific games to find out if one of them has the highest attendance value.\n\nRelevant Cells:\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n]\n\nThe opponent for row 2 is \"baltimore colts\" and the venue is \"memorial stadium\". These values appear only once in the table. The game on September 22 against Baltimore at Memorial Stadium is the only instance of these values in the table, so we compare this game's attendance with the rest of the games to determine if it has the highest attendance value.\n\nNow let us look for the attendance column where the row index matches our relevant cell and find the value: 41252.\n\nThe next step is to iterate over each row in the table again, this time looking for the maximum attendance:\n- Row 1: 56267 (L)\n- Row 2: 41252 (W - our potential highest attendance)\n- Row 3: 47292 (W)\n- Row 4: 56267 (L)\n- Row 5: 47499 (W)\n- Row 6: 50623 (L)\n- Row 7: 51775 (L)\n- Row 8: 56267 (L)\n- Row 9: 46567 (W)\n- Row 10: 47924 (W)\n- Row 11: 56267 (W)\n- Row 12: 42030 (L)\n- Row 13: 47475 (L)\n- Row 14: 10020 (L)\n\nThe highest attendance value in the table is 56267, and it appears twice. However, since we have already identified a game with a potentially higher attendance value of 41252, we compare this value to the games with 56267 attendance:\n- The game on September 22 against Baltimore at Memorial Stadium (row 2) has an attendance of 41252.\n- The games with 56267 attendance are from row 1 and 8, but these have the same opponent (Minnesota Vikings). Since the attendance values for this opponent are different, we cannot compare them based solely on the opponent. To make a final decision, we would need to know if the September 22 game against Baltimore was played at Lambeau Field or Memorial Stadium in Green Bay, as it is possible that the venue could have affected the attendance and potentially led to higher attendance for the game against Baltimore than one of the games against Minnesota.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively say whether the claim \"the packer game with the highest attendance was against baltimore on september 22\" is TRUE or FALSE, as there is insufficient data to compare the potential effect of different venues on attendance.\n\nFinal JSON output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Compare each row's opponent and venue to find unique instances.\",\n    \"Identify the game(s) with a potentially higher attendance value than the rest.\",\n    \"Iterate over the entire table to compare all games' attendance values.\",\n    \"Determine if the game with the potentially higher attendance value is indeed the highest attendance game.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"INSUFFICIENT DATA\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}",
