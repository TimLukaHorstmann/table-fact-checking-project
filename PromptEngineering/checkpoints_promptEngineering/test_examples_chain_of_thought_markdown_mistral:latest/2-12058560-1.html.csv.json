The team's score (10) subtracted by the opponent's score (8) results in a difference of 2 points, not 42 points.\n\nSince there are no instances where the team's result shows a clear indication of a large margin of victory (a difference of at least 40 points), the given claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"<described above>\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"result\" }\n  ]\n}",
