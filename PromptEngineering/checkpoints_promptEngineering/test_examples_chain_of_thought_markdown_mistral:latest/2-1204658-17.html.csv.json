The home team according to the claim is Richmond, which is present in the table.\n2. Check if the score of the home team (Richmond) as per the claim matches with the score for Richmond in the table. The score for Richmond in the table is 4.17 (41). According to the claim, it's also 4.17 (41). Therefore, they match.\n3. Check if the away team mentioned in the claim (Carlton) is present in the table and its score matches with the score for Carlton as an away team in the table. In the table, Carlton appears as the opponent of Richmond, and their score is 6.12 (48). According to the claim, it's also 6.12 (48). Therefore, they match.\n4. Check if the venue for both teams in the table matches the venues mentioned in the claim. In the table, the venue for Richmond is punt road oval and for Carlton as an away team, there is no explicit mention of the venue since it's considered the \"away\" venue. However, according to the claim, Richmond plays at punt road oval, which aligns with what we see in the table.\n5. Check if the date mentioned in the claim matches with any of the dates in the table.
