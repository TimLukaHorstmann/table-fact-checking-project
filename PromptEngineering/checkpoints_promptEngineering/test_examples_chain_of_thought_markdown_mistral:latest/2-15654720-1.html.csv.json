Verify the values for each column for the given season:\n   a. \"events\" column: The value should be 7 according to the claim. From the table, we can see that the value in the 1st row under the \"events\" column is indeed 7.\n   b. \"cash\" column: The value should be 6 according to the claim. From the table, we can see that the value in the 1st row under the \"cash\" column is also 6.\n   c. \"match play\" column: The value should be less than 13 according to the claim. From the table, we can see that the value in the 1st row under the \"match play\" column is 2, which is smaller than 13.\n\nAfter examining all the conditions specified in the claim, we find that they are met in the provided table for the given season (2002 - 2003).
