Find the row related to symphony towers: Since we are looking for the building associated with the year 1989, I will look for a row where the \"year\" column is equal to 1989.\n\n4. Check the rank of the found row: Once I have identified the row corresponding to the symphony towers, I will verify if its rank (indicated by the \"rank\" column) is indeed 2.\n\n5.
