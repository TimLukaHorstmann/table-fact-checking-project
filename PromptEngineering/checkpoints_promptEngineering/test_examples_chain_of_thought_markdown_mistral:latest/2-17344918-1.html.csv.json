    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the year for which the claim of a 4 - 1 2nd leg score is made. In the case of this claim, it is not specified which year, so we will have to look at every row in the table.\n\n2. Next, for each year, we check if the 2nd leg column matches the given score (4 - 1). Since the claim does not specify the team involved, we compare this score with all rows that contain a 4 - 1 score in the 2nd leg column.\n\n3. By analyzing the table, we find the year 2004 has a row where the 2nd leg column shows a 4 - 1 score (in the 2006 row, it is shown as a 4 - 2 score, but there's an additional column indicating that this was a penalty shootout).\n\n4. We also notice that for the year 2004, the team 'san jos\u00e9 de los arroyos' won with a 4 - 3 aggregate score and the 1st leg had a 0 - 2 score, as mentioned in the table. However, since the claim only specifies the 2nd leg score and not the aggregate or 1st leg scores, this discrepancy does not affect our comparison of the 2nd leg score (4 - 1).\n\n5. Since we found a match for the given score in the 2nd leg column (4 - 1) in the year 2004, we can conclude that the claim is correct for this year.\n\n   Final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the year for which the claim of a 4 - 1 2nd leg score is made (if not specified, look at every row in the table).\",\n                       \"For each year, compare the 2nd leg column with the given score (4 - 1) to find any matches.\",\n                       \"Inspect the matching rows to confirm that the given score indeed corresponds to the correct year.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"year\"}, {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}]",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to check the claim:\n\n1. Identify the year for which we need to verify if the 1st leg was 4 - 1. In this case, it's for the year 2004.\n2. Look at the table column named \"year\" to find the row that corresponds to 2004. The relevant row is row_index=35 (since rows are indexed from 0).\n3. Check the cell in the row with index 35 and column named \"1st leg\". The value of this cell should tell us if the 1st leg was 4 - 1 for the year 2004.\n\nBased on these steps, we can find the relevant cells as follows:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the year for which the claim is made (2004),\"\n                      \"Find the corresponding row in the table (row_index=35),\"\n                      \"Check the value of the cell in the column '1st leg' in the found row.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"}]\n}",

This will give us the years when San Pedro finished as a runner-up since we know they cannot be winners in those years.\n2. From the remaining rows, check if there exists any 2nd leg score that is equal to '3 - 0'.\n\nNow, let's analyze the table:\n\n1. There are two rows where San Pedro appears as the runner-up: 1984 and 1996. We eliminate these rows.\n2. After eliminating the given years, there remains only one relevant row left with the 2nd leg score '3 - 0' in the table (year 1998).\n\nIn summary, since we found a match where the second leg score is '3 - 0' and San Pedro was the runner-up in that year (1998), our claim is TRUE.\n\nThe final answer will be:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find rows with winner column containing San Pedro to find years where San Pedro finished as a runner-up.\",\n    \"Eliminate these rows from the table.\",\n    \"Check if there exists any remaining row with a 2nd leg score of '3 - 0'.\",\n    \"Analyze the table and verify that we found a match for '3 - 0' in year 1998.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\" }\n  ]\n}",
