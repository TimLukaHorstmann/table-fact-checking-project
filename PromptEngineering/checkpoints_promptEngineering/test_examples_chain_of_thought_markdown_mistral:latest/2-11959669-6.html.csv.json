Find the score column for that row: The score column in the table contains the points scored by each team, and in this case, the value for the 'Charlotte' row is '108 - 100', which translates to 100 (since it represents their own points).\n4. Compare the found score with other scores in the table: To find the lowest point, we need to compare this score with the scores of all other teams in the table. In our table, there are rows for Cleveland, LA Clippers, Minnesota, San Antonio, Indiana, New York, Denver, Golden State, Phoenix, Portland, and another LA Clippers, but not Charlotte itself. The scores for these teams range from 88 to 118. Since we are only comparing with other team's points, the score of Charlotte (100) is still a valid comparison.\n5.

Final answer: Since the score of 100 for Charlotte is not lower than any other team's score in the table, we can conclude that the claim \"the lowest point for Charlotte be allen (23)\" is FALSE because the points scored by Charlotte (100) are higher than the claimed lowest point (23).\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the team whose lowest point we are trying to find: Charlotte.
