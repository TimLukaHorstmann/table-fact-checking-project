Determine the number of locomotives built for 'c3' by finding the row with class 'c3', identifying the number in the 'no built' column. The value is 10.\n3. Determine the number of locomotives built for 'i1' by finding the row with class 'i1', identifying the number in the 'no built' column. To do this, we need to find the total number of 'i1' locomotives and subtract the ones that have already been built before 1906 (since the table starts from 1905). The relevant rows for this are 'i1', 'i2', 'i3', 'i4'. We can see that the total number of 'i1' locomotives built by 1906 is 20 + 10 + 27 + 5 = 62. By subtracting the 'no built' value for the first 'i1' (which has already been built), we get 62 - 20 = 42.\n4. Compare the number of locomotives built for 'c3' and 'i1'. If 42 is greater than 10, then the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's output our answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the number of locomotives built for each class 'c3' and 'i1'.\",\n    \"Determine the number of locomotives built for 'c3'.\",\n    \"Determine the number of locomotives built for 'i1'.\",\n    \"Calculate the total number of 'i1' locomotives built by 1906.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"no built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"no built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"no built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"no built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"no built\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the claim is true because there are indeed 10 more locomotives built for 'i1' than 'c3'.",
