To check this, we will look for any rows in the table where the name \"Jehan Mubarak\" appears as a partner in a partnership under the column 'partnerships'.\n3. We observe two such rows: 7th and 8th. The 7th row has Jehan Mubarak partnered with Gayan Wijekoon, and the 8th row has him partnered with Chaminda Vaas.\n4. To confirm if these are the teams that finished in the 9th and 10th place, we will look for rows where 'wicket' is neither 1st nor 2nd (since those were the highest runs scored). The team that scored 73 runs in the 6th wicket has a higher score than the team that scored 45 runs in the 7th wicket. Therefore, we can infer that the team with Jehan Mubarak and Gayan Wijekoon (Row 7) finished higher (i.e., not in the 10th place).\n5. Since there are no other rows where Jehan Mubarak appears as a partner, the remaining row to check is the one with the team that scored 40 runs in the 8th wicket (Row 8).\n6. Checking this row, we observe that it is lower than Row 7, which implies that this team finished below the team with Jehan Mubarak and Gayan Wijekoon (i.e., not in the 9th place either).\n7. Since there were no other rows where Jehan Mubarak appeared as a partner after the 8th row, it can be concluded that he was part of both the teams that finished in the 9th and 10th places (Row 7 and Row 8).\n\nHere is the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Understand the claim\",\n    \"Find rows where Jehan Mubarak appears as a partner\",\n    \"Identify teams based on 'wicket' and runs\",\n    \"Check if each team finished in the 9th or 10th place\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"partnerships\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"partnerships\" }\n  ]\n}",
