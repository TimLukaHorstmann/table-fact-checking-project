The relevant cell is the last one (row index 25, column name \"points\").\n2. From this cell, we can see that the Coquitlam Adanacs have a total of 1177 points over all seasons listed in the table.\n3. Next, I will check if the number of seasons for which the points are calculated is equal to 45 (as stated in the claim). We can count the number of rows corresponding to Coquitlam Adanacs, and it turns out that there are indeed 45 rows for this team.\n4. Lastly, I will compare the total number of points calculated from the table with the number given in the claim. They match, so both values are equal.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Examine the 'points' column for Coquitlam Adanacs\", \"Check that the number of seasons corresponds to 45\", \"Compare the total points with the number given in the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"points\"}]\n}",

Verify if the number of losses in each season is exactly 13:\n    - For 1977: The number of losses is 12, which doesn't satisfy the condition since it's not equal to 13.\n    - For 1978: There is no row for this year as it seems to be a mistake in the table (it should have been 25 games instead).\n    - For 1989: The number of losses is 9, which doesn't satisfy the condition since it's not equal to 13.\n\nThe final answer based on this analysis would be:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Check seasons specified in the claim and find corresponding rows\\nVerify if the number of games is more than 18 and less than 26\\nVerify if the number of losses is exactly 13\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}",
