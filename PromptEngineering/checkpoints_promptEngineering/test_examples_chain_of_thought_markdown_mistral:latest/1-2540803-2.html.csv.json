Understand what the table represents: The table provides information about various oils, including total fat content, specific types of fats (saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated), and their smoke points. Vegetable shortening is also included, but it's hydrogenated, which means its composition and properties differ from natural oils.\n3. Compare the data for suet: In this table, we can find the information about suet in the rows with a header \"suet\". The smoke point of suet is given as \"200degree (400degree)\".\n4. Check if there are any other rows that contain a smoke point value: Going through the rest of the table, we don't find any other rows that have a smoke point value listed.\n5. Make a conclusion based on the claim and comparison: Since suet is the only material in this table with a smoke point value listed, it can be said that it's unique in this context according to the given claim.\n\nWith these steps, we can conclude that suet is the only material to have a smoke point among the provided oils (and vegetable shortening).\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim\", \"Understand table content\", \"Compare suet data\", \"Check for other smoke points\", \"Make conclusion\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"smoke point\"}]\n}\n```",
