To do this, we look for a row where \"replaced by\" is Daniel Uberti and the \"date of vacancy\" is Dec 29, 2008 or the same day as someone else's appointment.\n\n2. Next, we need to find out if Nelson Ancheta was appointed manager on Dec 29, 2008. To do this, we look for a row where \"date of appointment\" is Dec 29, 2008 or the same day as someone else's vacancy and the \"appointed to\" team is Nelson Ancheta.\n\n3. By examining the table, we see that Daniel Uberti was replaced by Nelson Ancheta (row 4: \"replaced by\" column), but the \"date of vacancy\" for Daniel Uberti is Dec 29, 2008 (row 8: \"date of vacancy\" column). This indicates that Daniel Uberti was sacked on Dec 29, 2008.\n\n4. We also see that Nelson Ancheta took over as manager on the same day, specifically in row 7 (\"date of appointment\": Dec 29, 2008), which is the vacancy date for Daniel Uberti (row 8: \"date of vacancy\").\n\nThe claim is TRUE.
