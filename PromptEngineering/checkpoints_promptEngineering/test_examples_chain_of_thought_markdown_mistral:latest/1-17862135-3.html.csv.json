Extract the number of dances from the found row: In the row corresponding to 'warren & kym', there is a column named \"number of dances\". The value in this cell is 16.\n\n4.

    "resp": "Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. First, I need to identify the couple mentioned in the claim - \"rocco & karina\". In the table, they are located in row 11.\n2. Next, I check if the total points scored by this couple match the given number (89). From the table, I can see that it does.\n3. Then, I need to find out how many dances they have performed. In the table, the number of dances for \"rocco & karina\" is mentioned in the \"number of dances\" column of row 11. It's 5.\n4.
