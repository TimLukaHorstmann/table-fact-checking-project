In this case, it does not specify, so we assume it represents all medals won by each nation across different sports.\n2. Next, we look for the number of silver medals won by Brazil (bra). The table shows that Brazil won 7 silver medals in total games.\n3. Then, we identify the total number of silver medals awarded across all nations to check if the percentage matches the number of silver medals Brazil won. In this case, there are 23 silver medals awarded in total.\n4. To find out the percentage of silver medals won by Brazil, we divide the number of silver medals won by Brazil (7) by the total number of silver medals (23). This gives us a decimal value of approximately 0.304 or 30.4% when multiplied by 100.\n5. We compare this percentage to see if it matches the proportion of silver medals won by Brazil in the table. In the table, Brazil has 7 silver medals out of a total of 23 silver medals, which is also approximately 30.4%.\n6. Since the percentage we calculated (30.4%) and the proportion in the table (30.4%) are similar, it suggests that the claim might be true.
