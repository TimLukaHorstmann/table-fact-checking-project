Next, we need to find if there exists a row where Montreal is the 'visitor' and the score column shows a 4-2 score (as per the claim). We see that in the 5th row, Montreal is the visitor with a score of 1 - 3 against Ottawa.

    "resp": "Here's my reasoning:\n1. To determine if the claim is true, we need to compare the home scores of each team during the month and find the maximum score.\n2. We will iterate through each row in the table representing a match where a team played at home.\n3. In this table, only one team (Montreal) played at home, so we will compare its scores with other teams' scores when they were away.\n4. Identify the dates when Montreal was playing at home and note down their respective scores.\n5. For comparison purposes, also note the highest score during the month when other teams were playing away.\n6. If the maximum score when Montreal played at home is greater than or equal to the highest score of other teams while they were away, then the claim is true.\n7. Let's iterate through the relevant rows and find the scores:\n   - Row 2 (Boston vs Ottawa): 2 - 3 (Score for Montreal when it was playing at home)\n   - Row 4 (Ottawa vs Boston): 2 - 1 (Score for Montreal when it was playing at home)\n   - Row 6 (Toronto vs Ottawa): 1 - 5 (Score for Montreal when it was playing at home)\n   - Row 8 (Washington vs Ottawa): 4 - 1 (Highest score of other teams while they were away)\n   - Row 10 (Montreal vs Ottawa): 1 - 3 (Score for Montreal when it was playing at home)\n   - Row 15 (Buffalo vs Ottawa): 2 - 3 (Score for Montreal when it was playing at home)\n   - Row 19 (Ottawa vs Montreal): 4 - 2 (Score for Montreal when it was playing at home)\n   - Row 21 (Ottawa vs Buffalo): 2 - 4 (Score for Montreal when it was playing at home)\n   - Row 22 (Pittsburgh vs Ottawa): 6 - 5 (Highest score of other teams while they were away)\n8. Based on the comparison, we can see that the highest score when Montreal played at home is 4 - 2, and the highest score of other teams while they were away is 6 - 5. Since the score for Montreal at home (4 - 2) is greater than the highest score of other teams while they were away, the claim is TRUE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Compare scores when Montreal played at home with the highest score of other teams while they were away\", \"Identify dates when Montreal was playing at home and their respective scores\", \"Iterate through relevant rows to find the scores\", \"Compare the scores, if the maximum score for Montreal at home is greater than or equal to the highest score of other teams while they were away, then the claim is true\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]\n}",
