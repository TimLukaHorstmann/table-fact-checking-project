Examine the table to see if there is a row corresponding to round 4. If so, check the kickoff date in that row.\n3. Observe that the table does have a row for round 4 (r4), but it doesn't specify the kickoff date explicitly. Instead, it lists another match (r4 replay) immediately following r4 which does have a kickoff date (1990 - 01-31).\n4. Consider whether the kickoff date for the immediate subsequent match can be inferred as the kickoff date for the previous match (r4). In this context, it seems reasonable to infer that the match listed as r4 replay was a replay of the original r4 match and thus they likely share the same kickoff date.\n5. Since there is no explicit information about the kickoff date for r4 in the table, we cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, if we assume that the kickoff date of the r4 replay can be used as a proxy for the original r4 match, then the claim \"1990 - 01 - 29\" would not be correct as the kickoff date for r4 replay is actually \"1990 - 01-31\".\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the round for which we are checking the kickoff date.\", \"Examine the table to see if there is a row corresponding to the given round.\", \"Observe that the table does have a row for the given round, but it doesn't specify the kickoff date explicitly.\", \"Consider whether the kickoff date for the immediate subsequent match can be inferred as the kickoff date for the previous match.\", \"Since there is no explicit information about the kickoff date for r4 in the table, we cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"kick off\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"kick off\"}]\n}",
