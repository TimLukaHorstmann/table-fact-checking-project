If, after checking all rows, there is no change in the res value (i.e., all subsequent rows still have 'win' or we reach the end of the table), then the claim is not true as the fighter did not lose any matches after their first win.\n\nNow let's apply this reasoning to the table:\n\n1. The first 'win' row is at row_index=20 (res='win', record='1 - 0').\n2.
