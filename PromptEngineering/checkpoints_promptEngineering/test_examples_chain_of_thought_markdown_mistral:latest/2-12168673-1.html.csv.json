Check the table rows for the year 2012 (the latest year in our table) to find out who the owner(s) of 'blueeyesintherin' were at that time.\n   3. In the row corresponding to 2012, the \"owner\" column mentions 'self / king / morgenson / travis, et al'. This means that there are multiple owners listed for this horse.\n   4. Look for any of these names in previous rows of the table (prior to 2012) to see if any of them appear as owners before 2009 (the earliest year in our table).\n   5. In the row corresponding to 2009, the \"owner\" column mentions 'westrock stables'. This name is not one of the names listed for 'blueeyesintherin' in 2012.\n   6.
