In the table, there are two entries for the year 2000; let's refer to them as row_1 and row_2 respectively.\n\n2. For both rows related to the year 2000, check the candidate in each case. Both candidates in both rows are john atta mills, but he had two different shares of votes.\n\n3. Compare the share of votes for the two rows. The first row (row_1) has a lower share of votes at 43.3%, while the second row (row_2) has a slightly higher share of votes at 44.8%.\n\n4. Analyze the outcome of each election based on the provided information. In both rows related to the year 2000, the 'outcome of election' column shows that there was a second round election in both cases. Since we are trying to determine if the specific second election of 2000 had an NDC opposition as its outcome, and it is evident that both elections were not final but rather required a second round, this claim cannot be verified accurately based on the provided information alone.\n\n5. Final answer: The claim requires more context or accurate data to determine its validity.

Since there are two rows with different vote counts and shares of votes for 2000, we can infer that it was indeed a second round election.\n5. The share of votes for Jerry Rawlings in both rows is greater than 50%, indicating he won his respective elections (either directly or indirectly through a runoff).\n6. To determine if the claim \"jerry rawlings win the 2000 (2nd) election\" is true, we need to focus on the row with the '(2nd)' label in the year column since that's where the second-round election took place. In this case, it's the 2000 (2nd).\n7. Compare the share of votes for Jerry Rawlings in the 2000 (2nd) row with other candidates in the same year, to ensure he had the highest share of votes in that round. Since there are no other rows for candidate John Atta Mills or any other candidate in the year 2000, it's impossible to compare shares of votes directly.
