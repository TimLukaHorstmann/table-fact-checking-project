Check the result column for any game where the Washington Redskins scored 40 points or more (since we are looking for a defeat). Since there are no games where the Washington Redskins scored 40 points or more, this is the first checkpoint and it fails.\n\n3. However, since the claim states \"their worst loss\" (without specifying the team), we need to look at other teams' losses as well. To do that, find games where the opponent scored more points than any score recorded against Washington.\n\n4. Look for the maximum score achieved by an opponent in the table, which is 42 points by the Dallas Cowboys. Check if there are any games where the score difference between the two teams is at least 23 (the score difference between Washington and Dallas, i.e., 42 - 17).\n\n5. Find all games where the opponent's score is greater than 17 + 23 = 30 points (since Washington lost to Dallas by 25 points, any game with a difference of at least 25 points or more would qualify as worse losses for Washington).\n\n6. Check if there are any such games involving the Washington Redskins. In this case, yes, there is one game where the Washington Redskins lost to the Dallas Cowboys by 42 - 31, which has a score difference of 11 points greater than their loss to the Washington Redskins (42 - 17).\n\n7.

Determine the number of games won initially (the opening 4-game win streak): Scan the table and count the number of rows where the \"result\" column indicates a win. For the first 4 rows, the team won all the games.\n\n3. Identify the games after the initial 4-win streak: Subtract 4 from the total number of rows in the table (16) to get the number of rows that come after the initial streak, which is 12.\n\n4. Determine how many wins are among these 12 games: Scan through the remaining 12 rows and count the number of wins. In this case, there are 9 wins (rows 5 to 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, and 16).\n\n5. Check if the count of wins matches the claim: Compare the number of wins found in step 4 with the requirement in the claim that the team won 5 out of 6 games. If the number is greater than or equal to 5 but less than 6, it means that they had a stretch where they won at least 5 out of 6 games, excluding an opening 4-game win streak. In this case, the count of wins (9) is indeed greater than or equal to 5 but less than 6, so there was such a stretch.\n\nRelevant Cells:\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n]\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the key aspect of the claim\",\n    \"Determine the number of games won initially\",\n    \"Identify the games after the initial 4-win streak\",\n    \"Determine how many wins are among these 12 games\",\n    \"Check if the count of wins matches the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}",
