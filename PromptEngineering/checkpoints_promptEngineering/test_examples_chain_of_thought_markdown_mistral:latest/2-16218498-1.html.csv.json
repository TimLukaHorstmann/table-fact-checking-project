The 4th game refers to 'cd el\u00e1 nguema' versus 'primeiro de agosto' and the 6th game refers to 'port autonome' versus 'sporting clube da praia'.\n2. Determine the scores for each game.

For the 6th game, it was 0 - 0 in both legs, making the total score 0 + 0 = 0 goals.\n3. Compare the scores of the two games.

    "resp": "Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. First, identify the teams from the table to find their respective aggregate scores (agg). To do this, for each team, add up the scores from both legs of their game.\n2. Next, compare these aggregate scores to determine which one is the highest among all the teams.\n3. Analyze the table row by row and calculate the aggregate scores:\n   - Saint Louis FC: 1-3 (first leg) + 1-4 (second leg) = 2-7\n\n4. Compare these calculated aggregate scores with the aggregate scores of other teams:\n   - Botswana Defence Force XI: 1-2 (first leg) + 0-1 (second leg) = 1-3, lower than Saint Louis FC\n   - Arsenal (Maseru): 4-0 (first leg) + 1-0 (second leg) = 5-0, lower than Saint Louis FC\n   - CD El\u00e1 Nguema: 2-6 (first leg) + 0-3 1(second leg) = 2-9, lower than Saint Louis FC\n   - LPRC Oilers: 2-3 (first leg) + 1-3 (second leg) = 3-6, lower than Saint Louis FC\n   - Asc Police: 2-2 (first leg) + 1-1 (second leg) = 3-3, lower than Saint Louis FC\n   - Port Autonome: 0-0 (first leg) + 0-0 (second leg) + penalty shootout score (1-3), lower than Saint Louis FC\n   - Saint George SA: 2-4 (first leg) + 0-3 (second leg) = 2-7, equal to Saint Louis FC, but since the initial claim is about the highest combined agg, this comparison can be skipped.\n   - Saint Louis FC (already compared earlier): 2-7\n   - Young Africans: 1-3 (first leg) + 1-4 (second leg) = 2-7, equal to Saint Louis FC, but since the initial claim is about the highest combined agg, this comparison can be skipped.\n   - Sahel SC: 4-2 (first leg) + 2-1 (second leg) = 6-3, lower than Saint Louis FC\n   - Tourbillon FC: 1-1 (first leg) + 1-1 (second leg) = 2-2, lower than Saint Louis FC\n\n5.
