    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the college(s) that left twice, once in 1974 and again in 1989. From the table, we see that only one college meets this criteria: Lenoir-Rhyne University (row_index 6).\n2. Next, check if there's a conference change for the given cell in both years of departure. In our case, we need to find if there was a conference change in 1974 and again in 1985 (the second time Lenoir-Rhyne University left).\n3. From the table, we see that in 1974, Lenoir-Rhyne University was part of the Southern Conference (SAC), but there's no conference change entry for 1985 since the university was already not listed after 1974.\n4. However, upon closer inspection, it is evident that Lenoir-Rhyne University joined the SAC again in 1985 and then left in 1989 (according to the \"joined\" and \"left\" columns).\n5. Now, we need to find if there's a conference change for the given cell in 1989, which is Lenoir-Rhyne University's second departure from the SAC. In this case, since the university did not rejoin another conference after leaving the SAC in 1989, there's no conference change entry for that year.\n6. Lastly, we need to check if the American Amateur Athletic Conference (AAC-naia) was one of the conferences Lenoir-Rhyne University joined during their existence. Unfortunately, there is no evidence in the table to suggest that Lenoir-Rhyne University ever belonged to the AAC-naia conference.\n\nBased on our reasoning:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify colleges that left twice (1974 and 1989).\",\n    \"Check for conference changes in both departure years.\",\n    \"Find conference changes for Lenoir-Rhyne University in 1974 and 1989.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"joined\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"left\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"current conference\" }\n  ]\n}",
