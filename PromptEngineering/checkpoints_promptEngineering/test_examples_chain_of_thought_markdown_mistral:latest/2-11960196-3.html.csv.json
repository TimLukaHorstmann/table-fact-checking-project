First, I identified the player whose name appears most frequently in the 'high points' and 'high rebounds' columns, as those are the criteria for the claim. In this case, it's 'dalembert' in the 'high rebound' column and 'iguodala' in the 'high points' column.\n2. Next, I compared the values of the rows where 'dalembert' appears in the 'high rebounds' column to see if he has the highest number of rebounds overall. In this case, dalembert has 16 rebounds in row 3 and no other row shows a higher number.\n3. Then, I compared the values of the rows where 'dalembert' appears in the 'team' column to see if he scored more points on any of those games than the highest points value in the table. In this case, dalembert has 23 points in row 3, which is higher than the highest points value (20 by Miller) in the table.\n4. Based on steps 2 and 3, it can be concluded that 'dalembert' does have the highest number of rebounds and also the highest number of points among all games, meeting both criteria for the claim.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify player with most appearances in high points and high rebounds columns\", \"Compare rows where 'dalembert' appears in high rebound column to see if he has highest number of rebounds overall\", \"Compare rows where 'dalembert' appears in team column to see if he scored more points than the highest points value in table\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\" }\n  ]\n}",
