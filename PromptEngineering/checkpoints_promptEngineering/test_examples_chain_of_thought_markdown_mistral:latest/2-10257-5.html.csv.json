Second, we need to check if there's another row where Geelong appears as an opponent and the score is specified.

This does not match the claimed score.\n   - The eighth row (row_index 7) has Geelong as the opponent again, but this time against North Melbourne in the year 1996 with scores of 7.10 (52) for VFL and 23.18 (156) for North Melbourne. This also does not match the claimed score.\n3. Lastly, we need to check if there's another opponent with a score that matches the claimed score. We find one such instance: The first row (row_index 1) has Collingwood as the opponent, with scores of 1.9 (15) for VFL reserves and 8.10 (58) for Collingwood. This is exactly the claimed score.\n4.
