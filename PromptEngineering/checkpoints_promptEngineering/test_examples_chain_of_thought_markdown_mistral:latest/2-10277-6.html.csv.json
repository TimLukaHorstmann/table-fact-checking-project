Next, we search the table for a row where the 'year' column matches 1999 and the 'project' column matches 'bulworth'.\n3. If such a row is found, it means that 'bulworth' was released in 1999, and we can then evaluate whether it was nominated or not based on the 'result' column.\n4. In this case, since the table does not contain a row where both the year and project match '1999' and 'bulworth', respectively, we cannot find any evidence to confirm that 'bulworth' was nominated in 1999.\n\nBased on the reasoning process above, our final answer is as follows:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the year and projects from the table\",\n    \"Search for a row where the year matches '1999' and project matches 'bulworth'\",\n    \"If such a row exists, evaluate the result (nominated or won)\",\n    \"No row with these conditions was found in the table\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

Find the row of 'The Untouchables' in the table: Row index for 'The Untouchables' is 1 as it appears at the second row with a year value of 1988.\n\n3. Identify the relevant cells: The only cell related to calculating the average is the year of 'The Untouchables'. The other rows are not necessary for this calculation since we are looking for the average only for this specific project. So, the relevant cells are:\n   [ { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\" } ]\n\n4. Calculate the average: Since we only have one data point (the year of 'The Untouchables'), we don't need to calculate an average. The single value we are looking at is already the average year for 'The Untouchables'.\n\n5. Compare the calculated average with the claim: 1988 (the year of 'The Untouchables') matches exactly with the claim, which states that the average year for 'The Untouchables' is 1988.\n\n   The final answer in JSON format:\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\n       \"Identify the claim\",\n       \"Find the row of 'The Untouchables'\",\n       \"Identify the relevant cells\",\n       \"Calculate the average using the identified cell\",\n       \"Compare the calculated average with the claim\"\n     ],\n     \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\" }\n     ]\n   }",

Since there exists a row with the year 1995 (row_index=2), find out if 'bulworth' is the director of the project in this row.

If yes, proceed to step 5; otherwise, conclude that the claim is FALSE as there is no evidence for 'bulworth' being nominated in 1995.\n5. Since 'warren beatty' is indeed the director for the year 1999 (row_index=4), find out if 'bulworth' (project) was nominated or won (column_name: \"result\") in the same year. If 'won', it contradicts the claim as nomination is not the same as winning; if 'nominated', proceed to step 6; otherwise, conclude that the claim is FALSE as 'bulworth' was neither nominated nor won in 1995.\n6. Since there is no row for 'bulworth' in 1995 (contrary to the claim), find out if there exists a row for 'bulworth' in any other year with \"nominated\" as the result.
