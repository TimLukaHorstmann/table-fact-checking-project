I am looking for the row of data that corresponds to the movie \"star wars episode II : attack of the clones\".\n3. From the table, I find this row at index 4 (since the first row is numbered as rank 1). The title matches, so we can be sure we are looking at the correct film.\n4. To answer the claim that \"george lucas is the director for star wars episode II : attack of the clones\", I look at the \"director (s)\" column in the row of data corresponding to this movie.\n5. The value in the \"director (s)\" column for this row is \"george lucas\".\n6. Since the value matches with the name we are looking for, it can be concluded that \"george lucas\" was indeed the director for star wars episode II : attack of the clones.\n\nNow let me provide you with the JSON object:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the table and the claim to be evaluated\",\n    \"Find the row in the table that corresponds to 'star wars episode II : attack of the clones'\",\n    \"Check if the value under the 'director (s)' column matches 'george lucas'\",\n    \"Confirm that the match indicates that George Lucas directed Star Wars Episode II\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"director (s)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Compare the claim with the extracted information: The claim mentions Barry Sonnenfeld as the developer for Universal Pictures, which contradicts the extracted information that George Lucas was the developer and it was distributed by 20th Century Fox / Lucasfilm, not Universal Pictures.\n4.
