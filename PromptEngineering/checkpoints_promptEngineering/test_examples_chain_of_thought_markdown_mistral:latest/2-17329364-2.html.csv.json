    "resp": "Here are the steps to reason through the claim:\n\n1. Identify the team for which we need to find the outgoing manager. In this case, it's Team Necaxa.\n2. For each row in the table, check if the team matches with the target team (Necaxa). If yes, move on to step 3; if no, skip that row and continue checking for other rows.\n3. For the matching row, find the column where the manager's status of departure is indicated. In this case, it's the \"outgoing manager\" column.\n4. Check if the value in the \"outgoing manager\" column for the given row matches with the claim. In this case, the value for Team Necaxa is \"salvador reyes\".\n5. If the values match (as they do here), the claim is TRUE. If not, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBased on the above reasoning:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the target team for which we need to find the outgoing manager\",\n    \"Iterate through each row of the table\",\n    \"For a matching row, check the 'outgoing manager' column value\",\n    \"Compare the value from step 3 with the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
