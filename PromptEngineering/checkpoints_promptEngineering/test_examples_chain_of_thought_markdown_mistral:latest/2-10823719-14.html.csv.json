In this case, it's the 4th row (index 3, counting from 0) as the away team score for fitzroy is 65 (1st row), hawthorn is 74 (2nd row), collingwood is 101 (4th row), and geelong is 100 (5th row).\n\nGiven our analysis, we can conclude that the highest score of the away team in this season was indeed scored by Collingwood.
