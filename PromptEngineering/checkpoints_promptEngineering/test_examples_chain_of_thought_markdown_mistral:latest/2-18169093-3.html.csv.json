In this case, there are four groups of players tied for first place (t1), three groups tied for third place (t3), and one group tied for ninth place (t9).\n3.

    "resp": "Here are the steps in my reasoning:\n\n1. First, I will look for the scores at the top of the table. These players appear to have finished with a score of 70 (Vicente Fernandez and Nick Job) or 71 (+1 from par) (Iso Aoki, David Graham, Tony Jacklin, Johnny Miller, Simon Owen, Hal Sutton, Howard Clark, Ben Crenshaw, David Jagger, Mark James, Greg Norman, Arnold Palmer, Bill Rogers, Sam Torrance).\n\n2. Since there are players who have finished with a score of 71 (+1 from par), and the scores in a golf tournament are always rounded up to the nearest whole number (e.g., if a player finishes at -1 under par, their final score would be 69), it is unlikely that the win score was exactly 70 or 71, as there were players who tied for these exact scores.\n\n3. I will now look for any players with a score of 72 (+2 from par). If there are players who finished with this score and some of them have an 'a' next to their name, this indicates that they are professionals (represented by the original player in the tournament), while those without an 'a' would be amateur players. In a professional golf tournament like the Open Championship, only the professional players compete for the title, and the amateurs do not win the tournament.\n\n4. I will look at rows 9-12 of the table, as these contain players with a score of 72 (+2 from par). All of these players are professionals, except for David Jagger (who does not have an 'a' next to their name). Since amateurs cannot win professional golf tournaments, David Jagger is not relevant to determining whether the win score was 72.\n\n5. I will now check if any player with a score of 72 (+2 from par) has a lower score in the \"to par\" column (indicating that they finished closer to par than the eventual winner). If there is a player with a score of 72 and a lower \"to par\" score, then it is possible that the win score was not 72. However, I see that all players with a score of 72 (+2 from par) have an 'e' in the \"to par\" column, which indicates that they are even with par or further away (i.e., finished the tournament at par or higher).\n\n6. Since there are no players who finished closer to par than the players with a score of 72 (+2 from par), it is likely that the win score was 72.
