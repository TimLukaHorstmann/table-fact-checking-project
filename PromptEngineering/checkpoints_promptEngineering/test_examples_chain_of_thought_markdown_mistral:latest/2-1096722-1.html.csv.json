    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that there are 10.6 million viewers for episode part four that have a run time of 24:57.\n\n2. Verify the data in the table: Check each row to find the details about each episode, including the title, broadcast date, run time, number of viewers, and archive format.\n\n3. Find the relevant row: The claim refers to episode part four, so we look for the row where the \"episode\" column has the value \"part four\".\n\n4. Compare the details: In the found row, check if the values match with what's given in the claim (24:57 run time and 10.6 million viewers).\n\n   Final answer:\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Verify the data in the table\", \"Find the relevant row\", \"Compare the details\"],\n     \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"episode\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"run time\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"viewers (in millions)\"}]\n   }",
