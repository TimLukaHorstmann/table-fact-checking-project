We start with the first row (ends), checking the name \"bennie oosterbaan mike tully\". We find their schools are \"michigan\" and \"dartmouth\". This does not match the claim since Bennie Oosterbaan and Mike Tully did not attend Nebraska or Pittsburgh.\n3. Next, we move to the second row (tackles), checking the names \"ed weir ralph chase\". We find their schools are \"nebraska\" and \"pittsburgh\", which matches the claim for Ed Weir. However, Ralph Chase attended Pittsburgh, not Nebraska. So this row only partially matches the claim.\n4. Continuing with the table, we see that Carl Diehl, Ed Hess, Edward L McMillan, Benny Friedman, Andy Swede Oberlander, and Ernie Big Dog Nevers do not attend Nebraska or Pittsburgh, so they also do not match the claim.\n5. Finally, we return to the row with Ed Weir, since he is the only player who attended Nebraska. However, Ralph Chase did not attend Nebraska as stated in the claim.
