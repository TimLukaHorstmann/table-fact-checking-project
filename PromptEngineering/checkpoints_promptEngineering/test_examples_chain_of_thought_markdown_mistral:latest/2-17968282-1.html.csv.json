    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the team we are interested in, which is Hurac\u00e1n. We need to find the average, points, and specific seasons (1991 - 92 and 1993 - 94) for this team.\n\n2. Scan through the table row by row until we find the row that contains Hurac\u00e1n's data. We can see that it is the third row starting from the top, labeled as \"hurac\u00e1n\".\n\n3. In this row, check for the columns corresponding to 1991 - 92 and 1993 - 94 seasons. The relevant cells are:\n   a) [row_index=2, column_name=\"1991 - 92\"]: This cell contains \"40\".\n   b) [row_index=2, column_name=\"1993 - 94\"]: This cell contains \"43\".\n\n4. Compare the values found in steps 3a and 3b with the claim's expected values (40 for 1991-92 and 43 for 1993-94). The claim's first value, \"40\", matches the value found for Hurac\u00e1n in the table for the 1991-92 season. Similarly, the second value, \"43\", also matches the value found for Hurac\u00e1n in the table for the 1993-94 season.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the team (Hurac\u00e1n), find the relevant rows and columns (1991 - 92 and 1993 - 94), compare the found values with the claim's expected values\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1991 - 92\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1993 - 94\"}]\n}",

We find that there is no such match in the table.

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the claim's key components: The claim states that 36 teams from the 1991-92 season have a smaller points total in the 1993-94 season, and one of those teams is estudiantes de la plata.\n\n2. Determine the criteria for comparing seasons: Since the comparison is between points total, we will look for teams that have fewer points in the 1993-94 season compared to their points total in the 1991-92 season.\n\n3. Check if any team from the 1991-92 season has less than 34 points in the 1993-94 season: By scanning the table, we can observe that several teams have fewer points in 1993-94 compared to 1991-92. However, none of them are lower than 34 points.\n\n4. Confirm if estudiantes de la plata has less points in 1993-94 compared to 1991-92: In the table, we can see that estudiantes de la plata had 38 points in both the 1991-92 and 1993-94 seasons. Since their points total did not decrease, they do not meet the criteria for being one of the 36 teams mentioned in the claim.\n\n5. Compare the number of teams with fewer points in 1993-94 compared to 1991-92 to the claimed number (36): Since we found no team with less than 34 points in 1993-94, there are strictly fewer than 36 teams that meet this criterion.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim components\", \"Determine comparison criteria\", \"Check for teams with less than 34 points in 1993-94\", \"Confirm estudiantes de la plata's points total\", \"Compare the number of teams to claimed number\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"points\" }\n  ]\n}",
