Check the table column 'character' to see if the provided character exists in the table. If it does, proceed to step 3. Otherwise, the claim is FALSE and there is no need for further steps. In this case, nick lucas is present in the table, so we proceed to step 3.\n3. Find the row corresponding to 'nick lucas' (row index) in the table.\n4. From the row found, check if there are multiple characters with the same name in the table by comparing all the rows in the 'character' column. If there are multiple characters with the same name, the claim is FALSE and there is no need for further steps. In this case, there is only one character named nick lucas, so we proceed to step 5.\n5. Check if the character is part of the main cast by looking at the 'main cast seasons' column of the corresponding row. If it has entries in this column, the character is considered a main cast member. In this case, nick lucas has entries for seasons 1 - 2 under the 'main cast seasons' column, so we proceed to step 6.\n6. Since the character is part of the main cast and appears in all seasons (according to the 'recurring cast seasons' column), it can be concluded that nick lucas is indeed one character on the show.
