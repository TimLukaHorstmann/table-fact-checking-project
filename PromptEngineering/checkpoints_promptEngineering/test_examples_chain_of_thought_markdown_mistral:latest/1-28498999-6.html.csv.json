Calculate the number of observations (rows) for each player. In this case, there is only one observation per player.\n3. Since both players have exactly one observation, we can directly find their average by dividing their respective total points by 1 (i.e., no need to sum up their total points and divide by 2).\n    - Matt Kuchar's average: 4935 / 1 = 4935\n    - Dustin Johnson's average: 4299 / 1 = 4299\n4.
