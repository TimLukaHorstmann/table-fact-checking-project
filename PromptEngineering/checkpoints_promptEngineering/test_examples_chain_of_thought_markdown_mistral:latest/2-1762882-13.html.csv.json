    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the competition columns that might correspond to a league season. The Scottish Football Season for 2003-04 would have competitions such as the Scottish Premier League (SPL) or the Scottish Cup, which are not listed in the table. However, the abbreviations \"ecqg5\" and \"ecqpo\" could potentially be league groups within these competitions, but without further context, we cannot confirm this.\n2. Check if there are any 0-0 scores (draws) that would result in no points being scored. A draw does not mean a team scores 0 points; it means they get one point each. In the table provided, there are no 0-0 draws.\n3. Look for rows where the score is a loss (a score where the opponent scores more goals). If Scotland lost all their games, it could potentially mean they scored 0 points in the season. However, the table does not provide information on whether these were league or friendly matches. In friendly matches, points are not awarded.\n4. Consider the possibility that \"ecqg5\" and \"ecqpo\" might be groups of a league competition within which Scotland did not score any points (as in they lost all their games). However, without further information about these competitions or the rules for points allocation, we cannot confirm this.\n\nFinal answer: {\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify potential league competitions, Check for draws and losses, Consider the possibility of a zero-point scenario in specific competitions\"],\n  \"answer\": \"NOT SURE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}",
