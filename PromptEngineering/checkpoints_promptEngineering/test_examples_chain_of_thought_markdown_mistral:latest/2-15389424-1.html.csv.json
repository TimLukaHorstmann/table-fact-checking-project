So, Corinthians has 30 points and S\u00edrio has 26 points.\n4. Find out how many games each team lost. Since losses are calculated as the difference between games played and points earned, we subtract the number of wins from the total games played. For Corinthians, this would be 18 - 2 (wins) = 16 and for S\u00edrio, it would be 18 - 3 (wins) = 15.\n5. Compare the number of wins between the two teams to determine if S\u00edrio won more games than Corinthians lost.
