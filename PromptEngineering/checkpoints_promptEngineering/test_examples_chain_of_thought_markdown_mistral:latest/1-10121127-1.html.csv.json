Verify the columns of interest for the claim: The columns that are relevant to the claim are \"number of australians involved\" and \"australian role\", as we're interested in knowing if there were any Australians involved in this mission.\n4. Examine the values of the identified columns for the corresponding row: For the first row, the number of Australians involved is 4 and their role was military observers. However, since the operation name doesn't correspond to the operation title mentioned in the claim, there seems to be a discrepancy.\n5. Final answer: To provide an accurate answer, I cannot confirm or deny the claim as it appears to be based on an inconsistency within the table. If we were to consider the operation name (un consular commission) and use the information from the table, the answer would be \"FALSE\".
