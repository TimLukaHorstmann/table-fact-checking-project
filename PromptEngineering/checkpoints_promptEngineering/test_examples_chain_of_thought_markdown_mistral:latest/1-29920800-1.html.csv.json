The claim is about the first episode of the TV series \"Hot in Cleveland\". However, we do not have enough information to confirm whether this is indeed the name of the TV series as it's not listed in the table.\n3. If we assume that the first row represents the first episode of a TV series named \"Hot in Cleveland\" (which is not confirmed), we need to find the episode with the highest US viewers (million).\n4. Compare the values in the \"us viewers (million)\" column for each row.\n5. The first row has the value 4.75 million, which is the maximum among all the values in this column.\n6. Since the first episode of a TV series, if we assume it's \"Hot in Cleveland\", seems to have the highest US viewers (million), the claim could be true.
