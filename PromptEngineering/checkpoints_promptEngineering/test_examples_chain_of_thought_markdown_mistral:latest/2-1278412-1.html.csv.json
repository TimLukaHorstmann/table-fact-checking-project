Since there's no row with the year column equal to '2011', I will check if any of the teams had a row without the year specified (assuming that means they were playing in that year).\n5. If I can't find any such team for 2011, then the claim is FALSE since there's no team list for 2011 given in this table.

In this table, we see that the New York Jets are listed for 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007, and the New Orleans Saints are listed for 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011. Since we're looking for data in 2008, I will focus on the row corresponding to that year (row_index=5).\n\n2. Next, I compare the team name in the given year with the team mentioned in the claim. If they match, then we can proceed to verify the rest of the data for that row. In this case, the team in 2008 is \"new orleans saints\", which matches the team in the claim.\n\n3. Now, I will compare the values for each statistical category (solo, sacks, int yds, and total tackles) in the given year with those stated in the claim. If they match, then the claim is true. In this table, for 2008:\n   - The number of solo tackles for the New Orleans Saints is 32 (row_index=5, column_name=\"solo\"), which does not match the claimed value of 98.\n   - The number of sacks for the New Orleans Saints in 2008 is 0 (row_index=5, column_name=\"sacks\"), which does not match the claimed value of 1.\n   - The number of interception yards for the New Orleans Saints in 2008 is 1 (row_index=5, column_name=\"int yds\"), which does not match the claimed value of 8.\n   - However, the total tackles for the New Orleans Saints in 2008 is 132 (row_index=5, column_name=\"tackles\"), which matches the claimed value of 132.\n\nSince the number of solo tackles, sacks, and interception yards do not match the values stated in the claim, I conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant Cells:\n[\n  {\"row_index\":5,\"column_name\":\"solo\"},\n  {\"row_index\":5,\"column_name\":\"sacks\"},\n  {\"row_index\":5,\"column_name\":\"int yds\"},\n  {\"row_index\":5,\"column_name\":\"tackles\"}\n]\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row corresponding to the given year for the New Orleans Saints.\",\n    \"Compare the team name in that row with the team stated in the claim.\",\n    \"Check each statistical category (solo, sacks, interception yards, and total tackles) in that row against the claimed values.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\":5,\"column_name\":\"solo\"},\n    {\"row_index\":5,\"column_name\":\"sacks\"},\n    {\"row_index\":5,\"column_name\":\"int yds\"},\n    {\"row_index\":5,\"column_name\":\"tackles\"}\n  ]\n}",
