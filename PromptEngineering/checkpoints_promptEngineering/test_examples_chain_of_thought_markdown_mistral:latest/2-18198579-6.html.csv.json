    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. First, I need to find the total earnings for each year from 2004 to 2013 as shown in the 'earnings' column.\n2. Since the earnings are not available for years before 2006 (as indicated by 'n/a'), I will start from 2006 and sum up the earnings for each year until 2013.\n3.
