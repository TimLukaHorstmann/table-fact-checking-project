The winner in row 7 is kanto gakuin university (column name \"winner\").\n3. Verify if the title corresponds to the stated season. In this table, the titles correspond to the years, and the number after the year denotes details about the match. Since the stated season is 2000 - 1 (i.e., 40th overall match), the title should be 37th for the previous match (row index 6). However, it should be noted that there is no explicit \"title\" column in the table provided.\n4. Check if the attendance is available. For this particular match (row 7), the attendance is not provided (column name \"attendance\").\n5. Compare the findings with the claim. The winner for the stated season was kanto gakuin university, which matches the claim. However, the title should be 36th according to our reasoning in step 3 but it's not explicitly mentioned in the table. Also, the attendance is not available as per the table, which corresponds with the claim as well.\n\nSince we found that the winner and the attendance are consistent with the claim, but the title is not explicitly mentioned, we will provide an ambiguous answer for this particular case:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the season given in the claim\",\n    \"Check the winner for that season\",\n    \"Verify if the title corresponds to the stated season\",\n    \"Check if the attendance is available\",\n    \"Compare the findings with the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"PARTIALLY TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"winner\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" }\n  ]\n}",
