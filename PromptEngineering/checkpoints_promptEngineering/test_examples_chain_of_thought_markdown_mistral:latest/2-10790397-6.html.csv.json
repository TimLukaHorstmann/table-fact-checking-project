The table has 6 rows (games) with 6 columns (home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, date).\n\n2. Look for the row in the table that corresponds to the venue named \"punt road oval\". In this case, it's the second row.\n\n3. Check the value of the \"crowd\" column for the row corresponding to \"punt road oval\". The value is 30000.\n\n4. Compare the crowd value for the \"punt road oval\" with the other venues in the table, looking for venues with a higher crowd size. In the table, there's only one venue (\"western oval\") that has a lower crowd size (20000) compared to \"punt road oval\".\n\n5. Compare the crowd values of \"punt road oval\" and \"western oval\", noting that 30000 is greater than 20000.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, we can conclude that the claim is true: \"punt road oval have a crowd of 30000, the biggest with western oval next at 20000\".\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Read the table to understand its structure and data.\",\n    \"Find the row that corresponds to 'punt road oval'.\",\n    \"Check the value of the 'crowd' column for the found row.\",\n    \"Compare the crowd value with other venues in the table, looking for venues with a higher crowd size.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
