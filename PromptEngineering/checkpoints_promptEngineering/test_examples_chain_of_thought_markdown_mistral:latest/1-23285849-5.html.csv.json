Since the first game is not included in the table (as it's on November 1), we can assume that Carmelo Anthony has played 15 games during November.\n\n2. Next, let's find out how many times Carmelo Anthony was the leading scorer in these games. We look at the \"score\" column for each row and compare them to see if any other player scored more points than Carmelo Anthony on a particular game.\n\n3. After examining all rows in the table, we notice that Carmelo Anthony is the leading scorer in 12 out of 15 games played during November (rows 3-5, 7-11, 13-16). In row 9, it was a tie between Carmelo Anthony and another player, so this game doesn't count towards our answer.\n\n4.

For each game at the Pepsi Center, find the \"location attendance\" column to get the respective attendance values: 15823, 15319, 21409, 19141, 16446, 19359, 16307, 19155.\n3. Compare each attendance value with 19000. If the attendance for a game is greater than or equal to 19000, then that game's attendance at the Pepsi Center is over 19000.\n4.

Row 4 has 'anthony carter', so we don't count that one for Ty Lawson. Rows 1, 2, 3, 8, 11, 14, 15 have Ty Lawson as the only player or tied with another player under high assists.\n3.
