    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the row corresponding to June 13 in the table. This row has 'phillies' in the opponent column, '4 - 3' in the score column, and 'spoljaric (0 - 3)' in the loss column.\n2. Compare the value from the record column for this row with the claim. The record value is '30 - 32', while the claimed record for June 13 is '29 - 32'.\n3. Comparing the two values shows that they are not identical, but they differ by the number of wins (31 vs. 29). Since the number of losses (3) and the number of games played against Athletics (0) in both cases match, the difference can only be due to the number of games won against other opponents.\n4. Since the record for June 13 is not found in the table, there is no direct comparison between them. However, based on our reasoning, if we consider a hypothetical additional game won on June 13 (making the score '5 - 3' instead of '4 - 3'), it would match the claimed record ('29 - 32').\n\nSince there is no direct comparison between the record from the table and the claimed record, we cannot definitively say whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE. However, if a hypothetical game were to be added on June 13 resulting in '5 - 3', then the record for that day would match the claimed record.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the row corresponding to June 13\", \"Compare the value from the record column for this row with the claim\", \"Analyze the difference between the two values\", \"Consider a hypothetical additional game won on June 13 to see if it matches the claimed record\"],\n  \"answer\": \"INSUFFICIENT_DATA\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"record\"}, {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]\n}",
