In this case, it is the row with index 8 (since the dates start from \"sept 2\" and \"oct 22\" is the eighth game).\n3. Check the column \"streak\". The value for this date (\"Oct 22\") is \"lost 2\", indicating that the streak was lost at some point before this game.\n4. However, we are not asked about when the streak was first lost, but whether \"Oct 22\" be the date the streak was lost at 7. To determine this, we need to compare the value of the column \"streak\" for the previous game (if any) with the one for the given game (\"Oct 22\").\n5. Since there is no row before row 8 in the table (the dates start from \"sept 2\"), there is no previous game to compare with. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine whether \"Oct 22\" was the date the streak was lost at 7.\n\nIn conclusion:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the date for which we are checking the claim (Oct 22).\", \"Find the row corresponding to the given date in the table.\", \"Check the column 'streak'.\", \"Compare the value of the column 'streak' for the previous game with the one for the given game ('Oct 22').\", \"Since there is no row before row 8 in the table, we cannot definitively determine whether 'Oct 22' was the date the streak was lost at 7.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"streak\"}]",
