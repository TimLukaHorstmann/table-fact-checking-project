Check if there exists a row where the 'team' is either 'saskatchewan roughriders' or 'montreal alouettes' (since the player might have been traded from Montreal) and the 'player' name is Nathan Hoffart.\n\n3. Inspect each row to see if it matches the criteria from step 2. The third row has 'team' as 'saskatchewan roughriders' and 'player' as Chris Best, which does not match our condition.
