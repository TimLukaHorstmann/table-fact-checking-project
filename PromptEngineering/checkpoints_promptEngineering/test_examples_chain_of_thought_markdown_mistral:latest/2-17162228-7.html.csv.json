In the table, there are three players (ernie els, colin montgomerie, loren roberts) with a score of 279 and 'playoff' in the money column.\", This indicates that they are tied for first place after the tournament and will proceed to a playoff to determine the winner.\n      \"3. However, to find out if there is another tie for first place, we need to compare their scores with the rest of the players.\",\n      \"4. We see that curtis strange has a score of 280, so he is not tied for first place.\",\n      \"5. We then look at the next group of players (john cook, clark dennis, greg norman, tom watson) who are tied for 6th place with a score of 283.\",\n      \"6. In this group, we find jeff sluman and duffy waldorf with a score of 284.
