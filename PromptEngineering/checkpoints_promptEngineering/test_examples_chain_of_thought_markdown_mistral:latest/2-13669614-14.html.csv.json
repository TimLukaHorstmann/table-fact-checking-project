    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the pitcher who played in the 7th inning, and check if there is any mention of record-setting for that pitcher in the table.\n2. Loop through each row in the table to find the pitcher in the 7th inning. The row with \"milwaukee braves\" has the pitcher who pitched in the 7th inning, and the row with \"chicago white sox\" also has a pitcher who pitched in the 6th inning. However, neither of these rows mention any record-setting event.\n3. The remaining rows are from the teams \"minnesota twins\", \"los angeles dodgers\", \"boston red sox\", and \"arizona diamondbacks\". The row with \"minnesota twins\" does not specify the exact inning, but we can assume that pitcher Dan Pfister did not set a record in the 11th inning.\n4. The row with \"los angeles dodgers\" mentions Jon Adkins and Trevor Hoffman, but it is the 9th inning, not the 7th. Similarly, the row with \"boston red sox\" mentions Chase Wright, but it's the 3rd inning, not the 7th.\n5. The last row has the team \"arizona diamondbacks\", and the pitcher mentioned is Dave Bush. There is no mention of a record being set for this pitcher in the table.\n6. Since we have not found any evidence of a record-setting pitcher in the 7th inning in the table, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the final JSON output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the pitcher who played in the 7th inning\",\n    \"Check if there is any mention of record-setting for that pitcher\",\n    \"Loop through each row to find the pitcher in the 7th inning\",\n    \"Eliminate irrelevant rows\",\n    \"Check for a record-setting pitcher in the remaining rows\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pitcher\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"inn\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pitcher\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"inn\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pitcher\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"inn\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"pitcher\" }\n  ]\n}",
