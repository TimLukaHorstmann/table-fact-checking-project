Find all rows corresponding to Oklahoma City Thunder games from March 2009 in the table:\n   - row_index 60, team: Dallas, location: Ford Center, record: 15-45\n   - row_index 61, team: Washington, location: Ford Center, record: 16-45\n   - row_index 62, team: New Orleans, location: New Orleans Arena, record: 16-46\n   - row_index 63, team: Philadelphia, location: Ford Center, record: 17-46\n   - row_index 64, team: Sacramento, location: Arco Arena, record: 18-46\n   - row_index 65, team: Denver, location: Pepsi Center, record: 18-47\n   - row_index 66, team: Phoenix, location: US Airways Center, record: 18-48\n   - row_index 67, team: San Antonio, location: Ford Center, record: 19-48\n   - row_index 68, team: Chicago, location: Ford Center, record: 19-49\n   - row_index 69, team: Utah, location: Ford Center, record: 19-50\n   - row_index 70, team: Minnesota, location: Target Center, record: 20-50\n   - row_index 71, team: LA Lakers, location: Ford Center, record: 20-51\n   - row_index 72, team: Toronto, location: Air Canada Centre, record: 20-52\n   - row_index 73, team: Boston, location: TD Banknorth Garden, record: 20-53\n\n3. Find the number of times Russell Westbrook recorded more than zero assists in those games:\n   - In rows 60, 61, 62, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, and 71-73, the value of 'assist' for Russell Westbrook is greater than zero.\n   - Row 70 and 73 do not have values for assists. However, since there are no other players with more assists in those games, it can be assumed that Westbrook still led in assists during those matches even though the data is missing.\n   - In row 63 and 69, other players had more assists than Westbrook, so he did not lead the team in those specific games.\n\n4. Count the number of times Russell Westbrook had more assists than any other player:\n   - 12 out of the 15 games (excluding rows 63 and 69) have values for assists where Westbrook led the team in this category.\n\n5. Compare the count from step 4 with the claim: The claim is that Russell Westbrook lead the OKC Thunder in assists 10 times during March of 2009.

    "resp": "1. Identify the team for which Nick Collison plays, in this case, it's Oklahoma City Thunder (since the table does not contain the abbreviation 'OKC', we can assume that 'Oklahoma City' represents 'OKC').\n2. Determine the month and year of the games by looking at the 'date' column to find March 2009 games. The table contains game numbers from 60 to 74, which are within the range of days in March (from 1st to 31st) in 2009.\n3. Check if there are consecutive 6 games where Nick Collison is the leading scorer for the Oklahoma City Thunder. To do this, we look at the 'team', 'score' columns and compare them for each game from the first row to the sixth row below (since we already identified March 2009 games).\n4. In the given table, we can see that in Games 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, and 67, Nick Collison's points are: 18, 0, 11, 0, 0, and 21. To be the leading scorer for his team, he needs to have the highest score in each of these games. Unfortunately, this is not the case as his highest score is 21 (in Game 72) while his teammate Kevin Durant scored 31 points in Game 74 (which is after the 6 consecutive games).\n5. Since Nick Collison did not have the highest score in 6 consecutive games, our final answer is that \"the claim is FALSE.\"\n\n{\n\"chain_of_thought\": [\n  \"Identify the team for which Nick Collison plays\",\n  \"Determine the month and year of the games\",\n  \"Check if there are consecutive 6 games where Nick Collison is the leading scorer for the Oklahoma City Thunder\",\n  \"Compare his points in each game from the first row to the sixth row below (since we already identified March 2009 games)\",\n  \"Confirm that he does not have the highest score in 6 consecutive games\"\n],\n\"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n\"relevant_cells\": [\n  { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n]\n}",
