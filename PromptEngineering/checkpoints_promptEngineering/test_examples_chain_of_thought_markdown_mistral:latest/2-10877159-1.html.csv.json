Find the relevant row: To check if the claim is true or false, we need to find the row in the table that corresponds to \"san sebasti\u00e1n\". In this case, it's the second row with the city name \"san jer\u00f3nimo\" which is a mistake as the correct city should be the third row (with the city name \"san sebasti\u00e1n\").\n4.

Find the row corresponding to the city with 91385 dwellings in 2007: From the table, we can see that no city has a population of exactly 91385. However, the closest match is the total row which represents the combined data for all cities. The total number of dwellings in 2007 is 91385.\n3. Check if the elevation msl is provided for this row: In the table, we can see that the elevation msl is only provided for individual cities, not for the total row. Therefore, there is no elevation msl value in this table for the city with 91385 dwellings in 2007.\n4.

Check if the density and area match: In this row, we can see that the density is 279.2 and the area is 103.34 km square. Since the claim states a density of 955.6, it does not match the data for san sebasti\u00e1n in the table.\n   4.

Check if there is a row with the correct area: We can see that the second and third rows have an area close to 89.44 km square (san sebasti\u00e1n has 89.44 km square, but other cities have smaller areas).
