    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the show (nominated work) that was nominated for a drama award in 2009. In this table, we see multiple musicals from different years. We need to find the one that was nominated in 2009.\n\n2. Scan through the table looking for shows that were nominated in 2009. The show \"shrek\" is listed in the year 2009 and it has been nominated for various awards such as Tony, Drama Desk, Drama League, Outer Critics Circle, etc.\n\n3. Determine if any of these nominations were a \"drama award\". In this case, there is no category explicitly labeled as a \"drama award\" in the table. However, we can infer that for the shows listed in 2009, \"distinguished performance\" (Drama League Award), \"outstanding actress in a musical\" (Outer Critics Circle Award and other awards), and \"best performance by a leading actress in a musical\" (Tony Award) could be considered as \"drama awards\" or awards for a dramatic musical.\n\n4.
