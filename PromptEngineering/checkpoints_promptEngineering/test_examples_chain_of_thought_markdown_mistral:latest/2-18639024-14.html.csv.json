    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, identify the players who played for Melbourne Victory from the table. We can find them by looking for rows where the \"games\" column has a value greater than zero, as that indicates they have played in the league. From the given table, we see that the following players were part of Melbourne Victory:\n   - enza barilla (2008 - present)\n   - louisa bisby (2008, 2010 - present)\n   - caitlin friend (2009 - present)\n   - tal karp (2008 - 2009)\n   - marlies oostdam (2008 - present)\n   - jodie taylor (2010 - present)\n   - katie thorlakson (2009)\n   - brittany timko (2008)\n\n2. Next, we need to find out if any of these players have been active for a total of 2 years. To do this, we can look at the \"years\" implicitly represented by the start and end dates of their playing career in the table. We will consider a player as being active during each year between their first appearance (if any) and their last appearance.\n\n   - enza barilla started in 2008 and is still active, so she has been active for at least 13 years (2008 to present).\n   - louisa bisby appeared both in 2008 and again from 2010 onwards. However, the table doesn't specify an end date, so we can assume that she is still active. Thus, she has been active for at least 7 years (2008, 2010 - present).\n   - caitlin friend started in 2009 and is still active, so she has been active for at least 12 years (2009 to present).\n   - tal karp was active from 2008 to 2009, which covers a total of 2 years.\n   - marlies oostdam started in 2008 and is still active, so she has been active for at least 14 years (2008 - present).\n   - jodie taylor started in 2010 and is still active, so she has been active for at least 12 years (2010 - present).\n   - katie thorlakson was active in 2009, which covers a total of 1 year.\n   - brittany timko was active in 2008, which also covers a total of 1 year.\n\n3. Finally, we can verify that tal karp and katie thorlakson are the only players who were active for a total of 2 years (tal karp from 2008 to 2009, katie thorlakson in 2009).\n\nNow let's present the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify players who played for Melbourne Victory by looking at the 'games' column.\",\n    \"For each player, determine their active years based on the start and end dates of their playing career.\",\n    \"Check if any of these players have been active for a total of 2 years\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"games\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"years\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"years\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"years\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"years\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"years\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 45, \"column_name\": \"years\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 51, \"column_name\": \"years\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 60, \"column_name\": \"years\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
