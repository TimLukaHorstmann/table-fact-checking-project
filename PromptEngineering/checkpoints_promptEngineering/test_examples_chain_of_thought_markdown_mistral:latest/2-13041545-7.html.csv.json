The game was played on August 31 against Houston Astros.\n3. Look for the attendance value for this specific game. In the same row, the attendance is given in column 'attendance' and has the value '36438'.\n4. Compare the attendance values for all games with a score of '3 - 5' to check if there are any higher ones. Since there is only one game with this score and its attendance is '36438', it means that no other game has a higher attendance with a score of '3 - 5'.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the scores that are '3 - 5' in the table.\",\n    \"Find the attendance value for this specific game (row index 40).\",\n    \"Compare the attendance values for all games with a score of '3 - 5' to check if there are any higher ones.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 40,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
