    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to understand that par for each hole in golf is typically 4 strokes, so an even par means no penalty strokes were taken on a round.\n2. Next, we look at the table to find Arnold Palmer's score. His score can be found in row 7 with the \"player\" column (row_index=7, column_name=\"player\"). His total score is 145 (77+68) which can be found in the \"score\" column (row_index=7, column_name=\"score\").\n3. We then compare his score to par. Since even par for a round of golf is 72 strokes and Arnold Palmer has scored 145 strokes, he is above par by 73 strokes (145-72=73).\n\nBased on the reasoning steps above, here is the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Understand that even par means no penalty strokes were taken on a round.
