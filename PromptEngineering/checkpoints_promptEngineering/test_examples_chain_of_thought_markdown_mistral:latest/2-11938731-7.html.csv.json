Players who have a number less than 2 in the \"tackles\" column are the ones we're interested in, as these players meet the condition specified in the claim (having fewer than 2 tackles).\n4. We find that only two players in this table have fewer than 2 tackles: Lee Larsen and Willis Yates.\n5. To verify if there is only 1 player who has fewer than 2 tackles, we count these players.\n6. Counting the number of players reveals that there are indeed only 2 players with fewer than 2 tackles (Lee Larsen and Willis Yates).\n7. Therefore, the claim \"there be only 1 player who have fewer than 2 tackles for the 1987 Pittsburgh Gladiators\" is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check all rows in the table\",\n    \"Find players with fewer than 2 tackles by comparing 'tackles' column values to 2\",\n    \"Count the number of players with fewer than 2 tackles\",\n    \"Compare the count to 1\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"tackles\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"tackles\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
