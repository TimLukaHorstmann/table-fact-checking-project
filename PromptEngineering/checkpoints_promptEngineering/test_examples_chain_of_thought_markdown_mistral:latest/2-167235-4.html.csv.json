Determine the relevant data: To answer the question, we need to find the birth and death years of each prime minister listed in the table and compare them with Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's birth and death year.\n\n3. Extract the birth and death years from the table for each prime minister:\n   - Kostaq Kota (1st time): born 1889, died 1949\n   - Pandeli Evangjeli (2nd time): born 1859, died 1939\n   - Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri (1st time): born 1872, died 1963\n   - Kostaq Kota (2nd time): born 1889, died 1949\n\n4. Compare the birth and death years of each prime minister with Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's:\n   - Kostaq Kota (1st time) and (2nd time) have a later death year than Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri, but they also have a later birth year. Comparing their term dates shows that they were not prime ministers during the years 1872-1963.\n   - Pandeli Evangjeli died in 1939, before the given year range (1872-1963).\n\n5.

First, I identify the individuals who served as Prime Ministers from 1928 to 1939, which are Kostaq Kota (twice), Pandeli Evangjeli, and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri.\n2. Next, I check if there were multiple times any of these individuals served as Prime Minister during the specified period.\n    - Kostaq Kota was Prime Minister twice in this time frame: from 5 September 1928 to 5 March 1930 and from 9 November 1936 to 8 April 1939.\n    - Pandeli Evangjeli served during two periods: from 6 March 1930 to 16 October 1935 and no second term is listed within the given time frame.\n    - Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri served only once, from 22 October 1935 to 9 November 1936, which does not overlap with any other periods mentioned.\n3. I then evaluate whether Pandeli Evangjeli was the only Prime Minister who served for the first time during this period.
