    "resp": "Here are the steps in my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the columns that could potentially be relevant to the claim, since the claim mentions \"round\". The relevant columns are 'pick' (which contains the draft number) and 'round'.\n2. Check if there are any rounds with more than one pick by comparing consecutive picks within each round. If a round has two or more picks with consecutive numbers, it means that round had multiple draft picks.\n3. Iterate through the table and check if there is a round with multiple picks.\n\nNow let's examine the relevant cells:\n- For 'round 1': pick 6 (eric curry)\n- For 'round 2': pick 34 (demetrius dubose)\n- For 'round 3': pick 60 (lamar thomas), pick 82 (john lynch)\n- For 'round 4': pick 91 (rudy harris), pick 104 (horace copeland)\n- ... (the rest of the table is not relevant for our analysis since we have already found a round with multiple picks)\n\nThe relevant cells for this analysis are:\n\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n]\n\nAs we can see, 'round 3' has two consecutive picks (60 and 82), which means that the Bucaneers indeed have a round with multiple draft picks.\n\nNow we can provide the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify relevant columns, Check for rounds with multiple picks by comparing consecutive picks within each round.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}",
