    "resp": "1. Identify the row corresponding to the date 'november 16' in the table. This row has the index number 8.\n2. Check the column named 'date' for this row, which contains the value 'london'. However, the table header indicates that this column is actually named 'location'. Since the value doesn't match any location name listed in the table, it seems there might be an error or mislabeling.\n3. As we cannot confirm the date from the provided data, it is impossible to verify if the given score for November 16 ('123 - 126') is accurate without additional information about the game played on that day.\n\nSince we cannot definitively answer the claim using only the given table, here's our response in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify row corresponding to 'november 16'.\",\n    \"Check if date matches any listed dates.\",\n    \"Determine if score can be confirmed with provided data.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"INSUFFICIENT_DATA\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
