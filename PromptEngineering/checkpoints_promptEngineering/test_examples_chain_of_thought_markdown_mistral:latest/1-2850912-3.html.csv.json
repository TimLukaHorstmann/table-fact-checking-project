Find the row for \"david mclay\": Scroll through the table until we find the row with \"david mclay\" under the player column. In this case, it's row 43.\n3. Check the position of the row: Since we are looking for the fourth pick, we want to know the number of rows before this one (including the first row). In our table, there are 62 rows in total and the \"david mclay\" row is at index 43. Therefore, the number of rows before it is 42.\n4. Determine the pick position: Compare the number of rows before the \"david mclay\" row with the desired pick position (in this case, 4). If these two numbers match, then our claim is true; otherwise, it's false. Since 42 (number of rows before \"david mclay\") does not equal 4 (the desired pick position), we have to check for the possibility that there might be headers in the table.\n5. Account for headers: If there are headers in the table, subtract one from the number of rows before the \"david mclay\" row. In this case, assuming there is a header, the new number of rows would be 41. Now compare this number with the desired pick position (still 4). Since 41 does not equal 4, our claim is still false even after considering potential headers.\n6.
