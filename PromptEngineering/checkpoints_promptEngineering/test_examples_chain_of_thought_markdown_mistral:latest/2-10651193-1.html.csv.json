    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning for the given claim:\n\n1. Check the table to find any players from Tennessee State (in the \"school / club team\" column).\n2. Identify their corresponding round numbers (from the \"round\" column, if they exist in the table).\n3. Compare these round numbers with the number 261 (as specified in the claim) to check whether any of the players from Tennessee State have a rank lower than 261.\n\nAfter checking the table:\n- The relevant players from Tennessee State are John Henry Smith (row 10, \"player\" column) and none other.\n- John Henry Smith's round number is 10 (according to the \"round\" column).\n- Since John Henry Smith's rank (10th round) is not lower than the specified value (261), no player drafted from Tennessee State has a rank lower than 261.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Identify any players from Tennessee State in the table.\\n2. Find their corresponding round numbers.\\n3. Compare these round numbers with the number specified in the claim.\\n4. Determine whether any of the players from Tennessee State have a rank lower than 261.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"round\" }\n  ]\n}",
