    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the team of interest, which is the San Francisco Warriors.\n2. Check each row for the column \"opponent\" to see if it matches the team of interest.\n3. If the opponent in a given row matches the team of interest, check the \"record\" column for the corresponding match result.\n4. Since the record is recorded as wins-losses, the number of wins should be equal to 1 (since we know the total number of games played by this team is 5) minus the number of losses in that row.\n\nNow, let's find the relevant rows where the opponent matches San Francisco Warriors:\n\n| date       | h / a / n   | opponent               | score          | record   |\n|:-----------|:------------|:-----------------------|:---------------|:---------|\n| october 20 | h           | san francisco warriors | 98 - 115       | 1 - 4    |\n| october 23 | n           | baltimore bullets      | 109 - 101      | 2 - 4    |\n| october 24 | h           | philadelphia 76ers     | 93 - 111       | 2 - 5    |\n\nAs we can see, there are three rows where the opponent is San Francisco Warriors. Among these, the only row that provides relevant information about their record in matches is the one on October 20 (row index 4). In this row, the \"score\" column shows a loss for the Warriors, and the \"record\" column indicates 1 win and 4 losses.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify team of interest: San Francisco Warriors\", \"Check each row for opponent\", \"If opponent matches, check record column for match result\", \"Find relevant rows where opponent is the Warriors\", \"From the relevant rows, choose the one that provides information about the Warriors' record (October 20)\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"}]\n}",

Count the number of wins when the game status is \"h\": Looking at the table, we can see that for rows 1, 3, 6, and 8, the corresponding values in the \"record\" column are 0-1, 1-2, 2-5, and 2-7 respectively. Since a win contributes +1 to the record, we count the total number of wins by summing these values: 0+1+2+2 = 5\n\n5.
