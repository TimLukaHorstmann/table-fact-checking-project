In row 13 (chelsea vs arsenal), Arsenal scored 1 goal which is less than 2, so this does not meet the condition of scoring more than 2 goals.\n16. In row 14 (bradford park avenue vs burnley), Bradford Park Avenue scored 2 goals which are more than 2 goals.\n17. In row 15 (southport vs blackpool), neither team scored more than 2 goals.\n18. In row 16 (leeds united vs newcastle united), Leeds United scored 4 goals which are more than 2 goals.\n\nThe claim is that \"in only 5 games do either team score more than 2 goals\". After analyzing all the games, we found that 6 games met this condition: rows 4, 7 (since they played a replay), 8, 11 (since they played a replay), 12, and 16. So, the answer is FALSE.\n\n   Here's the final output in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Count the number of rows where at least one team scored more than 2 goals.\",\n    \"Examine each row to determine if either team scored more than 2 goals.\",\n    \"In row 1, neither team scored more than 2 goals.\",\n    \"In row 2, neither team scored more than 2 goals.\",\n    \"In row 3, neither team scored more than 2 goals.\",\n    \"In row 4, Blackburn Rovers scored more than 2 goals.\",\n    \"In row 5, neither team scored more than 2 goals (however, they played a replay and Sunderland scored 3 goals in the replay).\",\n    \"In row 6, neither team scored more than 2 goals.\",\n    \"In row 7, neither team scored more than 2 goals (however, they played a replay and Wolverhampton Wanderers scored 4 goals in the replay).\",\n    \"In row 8, Sheffield United scored more than 2 goals.\",\n    \"In row 9, neither team scored more than 2 goals.\",\n    \"In row 10, Portsmouth scored 1 goal which is more than 2, but less than 3, so this does not meet the condition of scoring more than 2 goals.\",\n    \"In row 11, neither team scored more than 2 goals (however, they played a replay and Wolverhampton Wanderers scored 4 goals in the replay).\",\n    \"In row 12, Everton scored 6 goals which are more than 2 goals.\",\n    \"In row 13, Arsenal scored 1 goal which is less than 2, so this does not meet the condition of scoring more than 2 goals.\",\n    \"In row 14, Bradford Park Avenue scored 2 goals which are more than 2 goals.\",\n    \"In row 15, neither team scored more than 2 goals.\",\n    \"In row 16, Leeds United scored 4 goals which are more than 2 goals.\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": \"FALSE\"\n}",
