Second, we look for the row that corresponds to position 7 to find the values for the relevant columns. In this case, the row with index 6 represents Corinthians.\n3. Third, we compare the values in the relevant columns of the selected row to check if they match the claim's values. The difference value (column named \"difference\") for this row is 2, which matches the claim.\n4. Fourth, we verify if the loss count (column named \"lost\") for this row is 5. However, the loss count in the table is 5, not matching the claim of 7 losses.\n5. Lastly, we check the value for the column named \"against\" to confirm if it's indeed 27. In our selected row (corresponding to Corinthians), the value is also 27, which matches the claim.\n\nThe answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Check position of Corinthians in the table\", \"Find the relevant row based on the position\", \"Compare values from the relevant columns with the claim's values\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"difference\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"against\" }\n  ]\n}",

From the rows corresponding to each team, find the row that has the team name as 'S\u00e3o Paulo'.

The points for S\u00e3o Paulo is given by the value in the cell where row_index = 6 and column_name = 'points'.\n4. Compare the found value with the claim.

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. First, we need to identify which teams have lost 4 games. From the table, no team has lost 4 games.\n2. Since there is no team that has lost 4 games, it means that no such team can have a difference of less than 24 because loss and difference are closely related in this context (the difference is the total points minus the losses).\n3.
