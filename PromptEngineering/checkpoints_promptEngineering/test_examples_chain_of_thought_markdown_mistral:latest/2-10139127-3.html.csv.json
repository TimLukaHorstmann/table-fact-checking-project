In the table, we can see that these two nations are located at row indices 11 and 12 respectively. The bronze medal count for each nation is shown in the 'bronze' column.\n\n2. For Panama, the bronze medal count is given as '1'. For Trinidad and Tobago, the bronze medal count is also '1'.\n\n3. Since we are asked to find if both countries have a total of 3 bronze medals, we simply need to add up their individual counts (1+1). The sum equals 2, which is not equal to 3.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find the row indices for Panama and Trinidad and Tobago in the table, then find their bronze medal count by looking at the 'bronze' column.\", \"Add up the bronze medal counts for both countries.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}, {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}]\n}",
