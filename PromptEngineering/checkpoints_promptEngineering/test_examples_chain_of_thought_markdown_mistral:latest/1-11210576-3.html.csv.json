In the given row for christian de la fuente, the value under the \"duration\" column is \"hard time - legal\".\n4. Determine the range of episodes covered by the duration. To do this, look at the first and last rows with episode numbers (episode count). The first number in the duration (\"hard time\") corresponds to a row number, which can be found by looking up the name of the first episode in column \"first episode\". In this case, it is the 18th row. Similarly, find the row number for the last episode in the duration (\"legal\") by finding its name in the \"final episode\" column. In this case, it is the 25th row.\n5. Compare the range of episodes covered by christian de la fuente's duration (18 - 24) with the given claim's range (02x03 - 03x05).
