    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the team mentioned in the claim (Warrington Town). In our table, it can be found in row 4 with column name \"team\".\n2. Next, we determine the position of this team in the table. From the table, Warrington Town is located in the 4th row, so it is in position 4.\n3. Now, we want to check if the goal against value (column \"goals against\") for this team matches the one provided in the claim (45 goals against). In our table, the \"goals against\" value for Warrington Town can be found in row 4 with column name \"goals against\".\n4. We compare the calculated values from steps 2 and 3: position = 4 and goal against = 45. The values match the ones provided in the claim (position = 4, goal against = 45).\n\nThe final answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team mentioned in the claim.\",\n    \"Determine the position of this team in the table.\",\n    \"Check if the 'goals against' value for this team matches the one provided in the claim.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goals against\" }\n  ]\n}",
