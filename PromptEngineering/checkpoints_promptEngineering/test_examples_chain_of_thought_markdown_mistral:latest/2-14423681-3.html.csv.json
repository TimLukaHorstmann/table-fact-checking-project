All bronze medals have a total medal count greater than 1 (for example, Bahamas with 17 total medals) or have at least 1 silver medal (for example, Cuba with 18 silver medals). Therefore, the claim is TRUE since there are no instances where a bronze medal has more than 1 total medal, fewer than 1 silver medal, and a rank of 8.",
