    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. First, I need to understand what the claim is asking for: The claim states that there is no defensive end pick and an overall smaller than 2.\n\n2. Next, I will look through the table column by column to find the defensive end position (column \"position\").\n\n3. Then, I will check if there is a row where the value in the \"position\" column equals \"defensive end\".\n\n4. After that, I will go through the table again, this time looking for rows where the value in the \"overall\" column is less than 2.\n\n5. If I find a row with \"defensive end\" in the \"position\" column and an overall smaller than 2, then the claim is FALSE. If there are no such rows, then the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's check the table:\n\n- In the \"position\" column, the only row where the value is \"defensive end\" is row 2 (tony brackens).\n\n- For the overall values in the table, there are no entries less than 2. The smallest overall is 3 (kevin hardy in round 1 and aaron beasley in round 3), which is not less than 2.\n\nSince we did not find any defensive end pick with an overall smaller than 2, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Check if there is a row where 'position' column equals 'defensive end'.\", \"Check if there is a row where 'overall' column is less than 2.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
