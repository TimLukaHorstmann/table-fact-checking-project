Determine how many rounds are present in the knockout stage by counting the rows from the start of the \"knockout phase\" section until the end. There are 4 rounds: round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and final.\n3. Check if all these rounds have draw dates either in August 2010 or March 2011 by looking at the \"draw date\" column for each row corresponding to the knockout stage. The rounds of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and final all have their draw dates either in August 2010 (none) or March 2011 (final).\n4. However, note that there are additional round(s) within the knockout phase (specifically, the first leg and second leg of each match), but these do not have separate \"draw date\" entries in the table. The table only provides the draw dates for the first legs of the matches that take place in August 2010 and March 2011.\n5. Since the claim is asking about the number of rounds in the knockout stage with a draw date, it seems reasonable to interpret this as considering only the \"draw date\" for each round without accounting for any additional legs within that round. With this interpretation, all the rounds of the knockout stage have their draw dates either in August 2010 or March 2011, fulfilling the claim.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the phase where the knockout stage is located\",\n    \"Determine how many rounds are present in the knockout stage\",\n    \"Check if all these rounds have draw dates either in August 2010 or March 2011\",\n    \"Note that there may be additional legs within each round, but the claim only considers 'draw date' for each round\",\n    \"Conclude that all the rounds of the knockout stage have their draw dates either in August 2010 or March 2011\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"draw date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"draw date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"draw date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"draw date\" }\n  ]\n}",
