Next, we need to find the player from Minnesota. This can be done by comparing the college of each player with the given college (Minnesota).\n\n3. After identifying the player from Minnesota, we need to check if their team is New York. This information can be found in the 'team' column corresponding to the row where the player from Minnesota was found.\n\n4. If the team of the player from Minnesota is indeed New York, then the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, the claim is FALSE.\n\nReferring to the table, we find that the player from Minnesota (Carl Elleer) plays for the Buffalo team. Since the team for Carl Elleer is not New York, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON format of the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify teams in table by reading 'team' column, find player from Minnesota (Minnesota college), check if team for this player is New York\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"college\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
