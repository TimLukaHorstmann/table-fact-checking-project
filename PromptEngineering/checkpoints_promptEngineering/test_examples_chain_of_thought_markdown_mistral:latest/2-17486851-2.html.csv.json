Examine the 'moving to' column for Paulo Costa's row: The 'moving to' value for Paulo Costa is not explicitly stated as Anorthosis Famagusta.\n4. Look for any indications of a move during the transfer window in other relevant columns: The 'transfer window' value for Paulo Costa is winter, which does not align with the claim that he is moving during the summer transfer window.\n5.

In this table, only one row has the name 'paulo costa', and it does not mention Trofense under the \"moving to\" column. However, the claim states that Paulo Costa moved to Trofense during the summer transfer window, so I'll look for any other indications of a move to Trofense in the table.\n\n2. Second, I will look at the type of move for each player mentioned in the \"type\" column. If it's 'contract termination' or 'loan return', this could potentially indicate a new contract with another club (including Trofense). In this case, three players have a 'contract termination': z\u00e9 carlos, kapsis, and daskalakis. However, none of them moved to Trofense.\n\n3. Third, I will check for any clues in the \"transfer window\" column. The summer transfer window is mentioned for gre (machlas), cyp (makrides, louka, daskalakis, kapsis), and bra (z\u00e9 carlos). However, none of these players are moving to Trofense.\n\n4. Fourth, I will check the \"source\" column as it might provide information about where a player is coming from. Since Paulo Costa's source is apoelfccomcy, there's no indication that he came from Trofense.\n\n5.

Look for any row where the 'name' is 'paulo costa' and the 'type' is 'retirement'.\n3. Since there's no such row in the table, check if a player can have a different type at a new club. Players may change their status when moving to another team (e.g., from contract to retirement).\n4. Check for any row where the 'name' is 'paulo costa', but the 'type' column does not specify retirement, and there's information about them moving to a new club in the 'moving to' column. This would indicate that the player could be changing their status.\n5. Find the relevant row where 'name' is 'paulo costa' and 'moving to' indicates a move to 'anorthosis famagusta'.\n6. Since we have found a player moving to another club, it is possible that his status has changed at the new club.
