The maximum number of points in the table is 55, which is less than 51. Therefore, no team has 51 points or more.\n2. Secondly, we will check the number of losses for each team to see if any team with fewer than 51 points has more than 5 losses. We note that a team can have up to 17 losses in this league. However, since no team has 51 points or more, it means that no team with less than 51 points and more than 5 losses exists in the table.\n3. Finally, we will check if there is any contradiction in our reasoning. We do not find any.\n\nAnswer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check for teams with 51 or more points\",\n    \"Identify teams with more than 5 losses if they have less than 51 points\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

    "resp": "Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n1. First, I will identify the teams that have drawn a match and also lost more than 3 matches.\n2. Then, for these teams, I will find their total points to check if they have earned 1 point out of a possible 49 (2 points for a win).\n3. If any team fulfills both conditions (drawn and lost > 3), then the claim is false; otherwise, the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the table to find the relevant cells:\n- Teams with a drawn match have \"drawn\" column greater than 0.\n- Teams that lost more than 3 matches have \"lost\" column greater than 3.\n\nRelevant Cells:\n[\n  { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drawn\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lost\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"lost\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"lost\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"lost\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"lost\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"lost\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"lost\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"lost\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"lost\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"lost\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"lost\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"lost\" }\n]\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified teams with drawn matches and losses greater than 3.
