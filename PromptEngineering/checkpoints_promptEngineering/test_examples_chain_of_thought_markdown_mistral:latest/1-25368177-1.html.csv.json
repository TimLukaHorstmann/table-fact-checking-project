    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the total points for each team from the 'total points' column. The top team, auckland aces, has 24 points while the bottom team, otago volts, has 13 points.\n2. Calculate the point difference between the two teams by subtracting the total points of the bottom team from that of the top team. This gives us (24 - 13) = 11 points.\n3. The net run rate is used to separate teams with equal points in case of a tie. So, let's find the net run rates for both teams. The net run rate for auckland aces is 0.596 while that for otago volts is 0.411.\n4. Since the net run rate of auckland aces (0.596) is higher than that of otago volts (0.411), we cannot have a tie based on points and net run rates alone.\n5. However, the claim does not ask for a tie but rather a point difference of 0.522 between the two teams.
