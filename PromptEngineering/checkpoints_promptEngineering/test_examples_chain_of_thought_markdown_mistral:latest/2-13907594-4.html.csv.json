    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the information required from the table to verify the claim:\n   - Score (should be 5 - 4)\n   - Location/Attendance (should be Montreal Forum)\n   - Date (should be after May 10)\n\n2. Iterate through each row in the table starting from the bottom because we are looking for a date that is after May 10:\n   - First, we check if the score matches the required value of 5 - 4. The fifth-to-last row has the score that matches the requirement (5 - 4).\n   - Next, we confirm whether the location/attendance matches the Montreal Forum. This condition is also satisfied for the same row (Montreal Forum).\n   - Finally, we verify if the date is after May 10. The date in the fifth-to-last row (May 10) is not after May 10, but since our next row (fourth-to-last row) is the one that meets all conditions, it satisfies the date requirement (May 8).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We are checking if there's an instance in the table where the score, location/attendance, and date meet the given criteria. First, we look for a row with a score of 5 - 4. Next, we confirm that the location/attendance is Montreal Forum. Finally, we check if the date is after May 10. We found such an instance in the fifth-to-last row but had to consider the fourth-to-last row because our first pick didn't meet the date requirement.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\" }\n  ]\n}",
