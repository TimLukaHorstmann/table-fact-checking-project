The only player meeting this criteria is Dave Valentine (row index: 2).\n   2. Check if the international debut for Dave Valentine was a Rugby Union (RU) Five Nations game against Ireland. The row with the player \"Dave Valentine\" (row index: 2) shows that his RU international debut was indeed a Five Nations match against Ireland.\n   3. Determine if the cross code debut for Dave Valentine was an Rugby League (RL) 1st Test between Great Britain and Australia. The row with the player \"Dave Valentine\" (row index: 2) shows that his RL international debut was, in fact, a test against Australia.\n   4. Compare the two events on October 9th, 1948 for Dave Valentine, as described in the claim. The cross code debut was an RL 1st Test between Great Britain and Australia (as per the table), and the international debut was a RU Five Nations match against Ireland (as per the table).

For David Rose, the cross-code debut is on 13 nov 1954, but again, this date corresponds to his Rugby League World Cup debut.\n\n4. Check Dave Valentine's international and cross-code debut dates. For Dave Valentine, the RU Five Nations game against Ireland was in 1947 (not provided in the table, but can be deduced from \"ru five nations v ireland\"), and his cross-code debut was on 9 oct 1948 in the RL 1st Test Great Britain v Australia.\n\n5.
