Check the gender column for the given school: In the table, we can find the 'gender' of each school. For the row corresponding to \"lynmore primary school\", it is 'coed'.\n3. Determine if the student body is co-educational (coed): If the 'gender' column for a school is 'coed', it indicates that the student body is co-educational. Since 'coed' is what we see for \"lynmore primary school\", we can conclude that it has a co-educational student body.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the school in question: lynmore primary school\", \"Check the gender column for the given school: 'coed'\", \"Determine if the student body is co-educational (coed): yes, since it's 'coed', we can conclude that it has a co-educational student body\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"gender\"}]\n}\n```",

Check the 'gender' column for the identified school. If it says 'coed', then the school is coeducational (it is).\n3. Check the 'area' column for the identified school. Since 'rotorua district' appears in the 'area' row, we can infer that kaharoa school is located within the Rotorua District.\n4. Finally, check the 'decile' column for the identified school. If it says '9', then the decile of the kaharoa school is 9 (it isn't, but since I cannot determine the exact value from the given table, I will label this step as indeterminate).\n\nSince we know that the school is coed and located in the Rotorua District (which are aspects covered by the claim), I cannot definitively verify whether the decile of the kaharoa school is 9 using only the provided data. However, the claim states that the 'kaharoa school in the rotorua district' should be coed and have a decile of 9, and we can confirm that it is indeed coed (but not determine the decile value).\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify school name in table\", \"Check 'gender' column for identified school\", \"Check 'area' column for identified school\", \"Check 'decile' column for identified school\"],\n  \"answer\": \"Partially true\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 106, \"column_name\": \"school\"}, {\"row_index\": 106, \"column_name\": \"gender\"}, {\"row_index\": 106, \"column_name\": \"area\"}]\n}",
