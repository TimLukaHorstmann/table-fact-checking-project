In 2010, Polona played in Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open, Indian Wells, Miami, Madrid (not held), Beijing, Premier 5 (Doha, Rome, Toronto, Cincinnati, Tokyo), and had matches in Olympic Games and Summer Olympics. In 2011, Polona played in the same tournaments except for Madison Open, which was not held that year.\n\n3. Count the number of wins for each tournament in both years.

Using this information, we see that in 2008, the year-end ranking was 243 and in 2011, the year-end ranking was 80.\n\n3. To compare the ranks, we subtract the lower rank from the higher rank (80 - 243) for 2011, and (243 - 80) for 2008. This gives us a difference of 163 for 2008 and -163 for 2011.\n\n4.
