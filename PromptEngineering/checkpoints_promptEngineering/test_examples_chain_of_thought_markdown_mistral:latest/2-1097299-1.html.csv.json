From the table, we see that there are 8 appointments made by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n3. Count the number of appointments where the judge has 10 or more years until their mandatory retirement (as per the claim).\n4. We can find these judges by looking at the \"years until mandatory retirement\" column: anabelle rodr\u00edguez (6 years), edgardo rivera garcia (11 years), erick kolthoff caraballo (17 years), luis estrella mart\u00ednez (27 years), and rafael mart\u00ednez torres (15 years). There are 5 such appointments.\n5. Compare the number of appointments made by Luis Fortu\u00f1o with the number of appointments that have more than 10 years until mandatory retirement.\n6.

To do this, filter the rows based on the 'appointeed_by' column with the value \"sila mar\u00eda calder\u00f3n\". This will give us 6 rows (Anabelle Rodr\u00edguez, Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton, Liana Fiol Matta, Erick Kolthoff Caraballo, Mildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco).\n2. Identify the total number of justices in the table by counting the total number of rows in the table (10 rows).\n3. Subtract the number of justices appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n from the total number of justices to get the number of justices appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o (10 - 6 = 4).\n4. Check if this number matches the number of justices appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o, as listed in the table for each justice (Anabelle Rodr\u00edguez, Edgardo Rivera Garcia, Luis Estrella Mart\u00ednez, Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n).

The year Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton was appointed is 2004.\n3. Since the claim states that \"none of the judge last more than a year as chief justice\", if the term of Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton as chief justice is more than one year, then the claim is false.\n4. To check if Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton served for more than one year as chief justice, I will compare the current year with the year he was appointed. If the difference between these two years is greater than 1, it means that more than a year has passed, and thus, the claim is false.\n5. To get the current year, I would typically use an external source or function to determine the current year, but since this is a hypothetical exercise, let's assume the current year is 2021.
