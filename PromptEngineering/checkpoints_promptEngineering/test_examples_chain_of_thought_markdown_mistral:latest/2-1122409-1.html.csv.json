    "resp": "1. First, locate the row in the table that contains Silvio Moser's information. In this case, we see him under the 'driver' column with a constructor of Brabham - Ford and having completed 9 laps.\n2. Next, check if there is any information regarding retirement or failure to complete the race due to an oil leak in the table. The relevant columns are 'time / retired', 'laps' and any other possible related columns such as 'reason for retirement'. In this case, we find that Silvio Moser did retire after completing 9 laps but there is no explicit mention of the reason being an oil leak. However, it's important to note that the information about the cause of retirement or failure is not given in this table, so we can only confirm that he retired (indicated by the 'retired' value under the 'time / retired' column).\n3. Given that the claim states \"Silvio Moser retire after 9 lap with an oil leak,\" it implies that both the retirement and the cause of retirement should be mentioned in the table. However, since the table does not specify the reason for Silvio Moser's retirement as being due to an oil leak, we cannot confirm the claim as true based on this data.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Locate Silvio Moser in the table\",\n    \"Check if there is any information about retirement or failure with an oil leak\",\n    \"Assess if the given claim can be confirmed by the provided table\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"laps\" }\n  ]\n}",
