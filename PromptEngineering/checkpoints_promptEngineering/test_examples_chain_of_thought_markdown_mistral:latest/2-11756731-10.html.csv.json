Now let's check whether 'elli' made the decision when Nashville was home:\n    - On April 10, Nashville was home but 'elli' didn't make the decision (row index 0).\n    - On April 18, Nashville was home and again 'elli' didn't make the decision (row index 4).\n    - There is one more row with Nashville as the home team on April 20, but since we haven't found a case where 'elli' made the decision when Nashville was home before this row, we can safely stop checking.\n\n6.

Therefore, we will check if any of the remaining rows correspond to the conditions in the claim (score 2 - 2, attendance 17113, and Detroit as the visiting team).\n4. Check row index 2: The score is \"2 - 4\" which is not equal to 2 - 2, the home team is Nashville instead of Detroit, and the attendance is 20066 instead of 17113.
