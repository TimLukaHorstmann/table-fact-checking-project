Compare the date to the week numbers provided in the first column (Week). The week number for each row corresponds to the row index plus one (since we start counting from 1 instead of 0).

However, a closer inspection reveals that there is no Week 14 listed in the table. This indicates an error in the table as the dates and weeks are not correctly aligned.
