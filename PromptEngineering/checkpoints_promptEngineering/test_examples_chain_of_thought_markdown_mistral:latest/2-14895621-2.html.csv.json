Since there are no such rows, we will have to check if they competed together by any chance without explicitly mentioning their names as partners.\n\n2. In this table, we can see three different types of tournaments: world championships, Asian games, and other open tournaments. We need to check whether they participated in the same tournament (regardless of the year or venue) since '1985' is not mentioned explicitly for any partnership.\n\n3. Analyze the rows where both \"hwang sun\" and \"kang haeng\" are involved:\n   - The first row mentions \"world championships\", but neither of their names appears as partners, so it can be ruled out.\n   - The second and third rows show that they have competed together at the Asian games in 1982 (row 2) and an other open tournament in India open in 1985 (row 4). Since we do not see any mention of \"world championships\" involving both players, it is impossible to determine if they partnered for the first time in a world championship at Calgary, Canada.\n\n4. The claim asks specifically about the 1985 world championship in Calgary, Canada, but our analysis so far shows that they did not compete together in any world championships in 1985 (or any other year).

However, considering that there are other types of events like Asian Games and Other Open Tournaments in the table, we should verify if this event could be the world championship.\n   - Venue: The claim mentions the India Open as the venue of their first partnership.\n\n3. Analyze the table:\n   - Inspect all the rows to check if there's a row matching the conditions mentioned in step 2. Note that the specific event type may not match \"world championship\" exactly but could be another significant competition like an open tournament.\n   - The table shows three different types of events, and in each one, Kang Haeng partners with someone else (himself) for the world championships, asian games, and other open tournaments.
