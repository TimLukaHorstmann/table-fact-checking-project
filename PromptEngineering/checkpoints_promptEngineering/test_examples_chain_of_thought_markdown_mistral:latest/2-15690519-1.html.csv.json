This is row number 5, as indicated by the value 5 in the first column (\"draw\").\n3. Inspect the fifth column of the row (\"rank\"), which contains the rank associated with the song \"this time\". The value is 8th, as represented by \"8th\" in the table.\n4. Compare the found rank with the claim's condition: the claimed rank is lower than 8th (specifically, it should be less than 8). However, we found that the actual rank of the song \"this time\" is 8th, not lower.\n5.
