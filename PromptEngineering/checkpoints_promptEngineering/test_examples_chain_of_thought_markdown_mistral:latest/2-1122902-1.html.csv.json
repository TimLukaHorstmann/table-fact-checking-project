This is necessary because a driver cannot be considered the fastest if they did not complete the full race.\n3. If no other driver has completed the same number of laps, Alain Prost is the driver who has completed the most laps, and thus he must have won the race. Therefore, we can conclude that if Alain Prost's retirement time (1:35:13.284) is the fastest among all drivers in the table, he would indeed be the fastest driver who has won the race.\n\nNow let's check the table:\n\n- No other driver has completed the same number of laps as Alain Prost (67).\n- We can see that Michele Alboreto and Nelson Piquet have a '+' sign in their retirement time columns, which means they retired before completing all 67 laps. The same goes for other drivers with '+' signs in the retirement time column.\n- Ren\u00e9 Arnoux has a longer retirement time than Alain Prost (1:01.430), so he is not faster.\n- Riccardo Patrese retired one lap earlier, but since we don't have information about his lap times, we cannot compare their speeds. However, based on the fact that Alain Prost completed more laps, it can be inferred that Alain Prost was likely faster at some point during the race.\n- The remaining drivers (Andrea de Cesaris, Mauro Baldi, Thierry Boutsen, Fran\u00e7ois Hesnault, Derek Warwick, Jo Gartner, Teo Fabi, Nigel Mansell, Patrick Tambay, Eddie Cheever, Philippe Alliot, Jonathan Palmer, Jacques Laffite, Elio de Angelis, Stefan Johansson, Keke Rosberg, Ayrton Senna, Marc Surer, Gerhard Berger, and Piercarlo Ghinzani) either did not complete the race or had a collision, so they cannot be compared with Alain Prost in terms of speed.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify driver (Alain Prost)\",\n    \"Find other drivers who have completed the same number of laps\",\n    \"Check if any of those drivers have a faster retirement time\",\n    \"Compare Alain Prost's retirement time with others\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\" }\n  ]\n}",
