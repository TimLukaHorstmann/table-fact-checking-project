The table consists of seven columns (home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, date) listing the results of AFL games played on 11 May 1957.\n2. Look for a row where the \"home team\" column's value is \"collingwood\". This would indicate that Collingwood was the home team in one of the matches.\n3. Since there are no rows where the \"home team\" column's value is \"collingwood\", we cannot find any evidence to suggest that Collingwood played as the away team on 11 May 1957.\n4. Compare this observation with the claim, which states that Collingwood play as the away team on 11 May 1957. Since no row in the table matches this claim, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\nIn JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify table structure and contents\",\n    \"Look for a row where 'home team' column's value is 'collingwood'\",\n    \"Check if found row exists\",\n    \"Compare the result with the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

If we assume that the claim refers to a match in any year, then we need to find out if there was an opponent for Essendon who scored 13.11 (89) at Princer Park. In the table, the away team score for Essendon is 80, not 89.\n3.
