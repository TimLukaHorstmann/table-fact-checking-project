According to the table, only two sovereigns have a \"viscount\" title: xiong yan the elder from Chu and xiong yong from Chu.\n\n2. Next, I compared these two viscounts (xiong yan the elder and xiong yong) to determine if they are the same person or not. Since their names are different, it is reasonable to assume that they are not the same person.\n\n3. Finally, since each sovereign has a unique title, I compared the titles of xiong yan the elder (viscount) and xiong yong (also viscount).
