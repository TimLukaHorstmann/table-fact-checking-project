In this case, Vince Carter played in all 16 games as indicated by the game numbers (from 3 to 16).\n2. Next, we need to check how many times Carter scored the highest points for the Raptors in each game. To do this, we compare the 'score' column with the highest value under the same row ('high points' column) and verify if Carter was responsible for that high score.\n3. In a total of 16 games, we observe that in 12 games, Vince Carter scored the highest points for the Raptors (game numbers 3 to 5, 7 to 9, 11, 13, and 15).\n4.
