Find James Hunt's row in the table: Search for the row containing \"james hunt\" as the driver.\n4. Check the grid value in James Hunt's row: Compare the grid value from his row with the claimed grid value of 2.\n5. Count the number of laps completed by James Hunt: Count the number of laps mentioned in the 'laps' column for James Hunt's row to determine if it matches the claimed 73 laps.\n6.

Look at the \"time / retired\" column to check if there is a \"+ X laps\" notation indicating retirement due to retiring from the race after completing more laps than the winner.

Next, we note the laps column for that row, which indicates 73 laps completed by James Hunt.\n3. We compare this value with the claim that James Hunt has less than 72 laps. Since 73 (the actual number of laps) is greater than 72, we know that the claim is false in this case.\n4. The grid column specifies the starting position of each driver.
