The table does not contain a column for names, so we cannot directly search for him. However, we can identify the nominees by looking at the \"nominated for\" and \"nominated\" columns, as those indicate someone was nominated for an award.\n2. Check each row of the table to see if Kristofer Martin is one of the nominees or winners in any of the categories. In the first three rows, the nominee or winner is listed under the \"nominated for\" or \"result\" column and it is not Kristofer Martin.\n3. In the fourth row, we find that \"tween academy : class of 2012\" was nominated, but this does not directly indicate if Kristofer Martin was part of it. So, we cannot confirm if he was nominated in this category.\n4. In the fifth row, we see that there is no direct information about who won or was nominated for the \"german moreno youth achievement award\". However, since it says \"won\", we can infer that someone won this award. Without further information, we cannot confirm if Kristofer Martin won this award.\n5. In the sixth row, we find that there is no relevant information regarding Kristofer Martin.\n6. In the seventh row, there is no direct information about who was nominated or won in the \"most liked loveteam with joyce ching\" category, so we cannot confirm if Kristofer Martin was involved.\n7. Since we have not found any clear evidence that Kristofer Martin was nominated for 3 acting awards in 2012 or won the \"german moreno youth achievement award\", we cannot confirm the claim to be either TRUE or FALSE with certainty based on this table alone.
