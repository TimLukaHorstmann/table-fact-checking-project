This will help us find all fossil discoveries made in China.\n2. From these rows, check if any of them have an author named Fr\u00f6bisch Fr\u00f6bisch. This will help us identify if there are any discoveries in China with this specific author.\n3. If a discovery in China is found to be authored by Fr\u00f6bisch Fr\u00f6bisch, the next step would be to check if that discovery is associated with the Jiufotang formation.
