From this list, find out the season number where the last episode directed by him is located.\n3. Compare this season number with the smallest season number in the table to determine if William Malone directed after season 6.\n\nBased on the provided table, we can see that William Malone directed \"heartbreak hotel\" (season 2), \"lucky stiff\" (season 6), and \"easy come, easy go\" (season 15). Since season 6 is the latest season where he directed an episode, we compare this with the smallest season number in the table (season 1).\n\nTo find relevant cells:\n- Row_index: [2, 4, 14] (These are the rows where William Malone directed)\n- Column_name: [\"director (s)\"] (This is the column we focused on to analyze the claim)\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We identified the episodes directed by William Malone and compared them with the smallest season number in the table to determine if he directed after season 6.

    "resp": "1. Identify the claim: The claim is that \"funhouse\" was directed by \"al katz and gilbert adler\".\n\n2. Find the row corresponding to \"funhouse\": In this table, each series has its own row with information such as season, title, director(s), writer(s), original airdate, etc. The row for \"funhouse\" is row 39 since its series number is 39.\n\n3. Check the column corresponding to the claim: To verify if the claim holds true, we need to look at the 'director (s)' and 'writer (s)' columns in the row identified above.\n\n4. Compare the values found against the claim: In the \"funhouse\" row, the director is \"gilbert adler\", and one of the writers is also \"al katz\". This means that at least one part of the claim (\"gilbert adler\") is true, but it remains to be seen if there was more than one director.\n\n5. Check for multiple directors: In this table, a director is usually listed with only their name, not the phrase \"and another person\". However, in some cases like \"interior loft\" and \"interior loft later\", the same series has two rows with slightly different titles but the same creators. This suggests that both may have been directed by the same person or different people. So we cannot definitively say if there was more than one director for \"funhouse\".\n\nSince we found at least one part of the claim to be true, and since we cannot conclusively prove or disprove the other part due to the ambiguity in how multiple directors are listed, it is not possible to provide a definitive TRUE or FALSE answer.
