    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning:\n1. First, I need to find the row corresponding to 'hunan', 'zhangjiajie' and 'wulingyuan'. In this table, there are two rows that match 'hunan' and 'zhangjiajie', but none that match 'wulingyuan'. However, 'wulingyuan' is a part of 'zhangjiajie' prefecture (according to the first row), so I can consider the population data from the row that matches 'zhangjiajie'.\n2. Next, I need to find the Tujia population for the matched row. In this case, the matching row is the second row where province='hunan' and prefecture='zhangjiajie'. The Tujia population for this row is 399906.\n3. Now I need to find the total Tujia population in China. This can be obtained by summing up all the 'tujia population' values from each row of the table. By doing so, I get a total of 7140825.\n4. Finally, I need to check if the population for the matched row (399906) is equal to 0.52% of the total Tujia population in China. To do this, I multiply the population for the matched row by 100 and then divide the result by the total Tujia population, then compare the result with 41910.\n\nHere is my final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the row that matches 'hunan' and 'zhangjiajie'.\",\n    \"Get the Tujia population for the matched row.\",\n    \"Sum up all the Tujia populations from each row of the table to find the total Tujia population in China.\",\n    \"Check if the population for the matched row is equal to 0.52% of the total Tujia population in China.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tujia population\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\" }\n  ]\n}",

Note the Tujia population for this specific location, which is 388035.\n3. Find the total Tujia population of China by adding up all the % of China's Tujia population values from each row. This will give us a total of approximately 673112 (summed from 13 rows).\n4. Calculate the percentage of the Tujian population that Lichuan represents by dividing the Tujia population of Lichuan (388035) by the total Tujia population in China (673112), which gives us a decimal value of 0.5734 or 57.34% when multiplied by 100.\n5.
