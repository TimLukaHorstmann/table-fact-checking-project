    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine the validity of the claim:\n\n1. Identify the series, season, and writer according to the given claim:\n    - Series: The series number can be found by counting the rows from the top until we reach the row where the title matches \"nuts\". In this case, it's row 7. So, the series is 74.\n    - Season: Since the episode in question is \"nuts\", we will look for its corresponding season number in the same row. In this case, it's column 2, and the value is 7.\n    - Writer: The writer can be found in the \"written by\" column of the same row (column 3). In this case, it's Amy Iglow.\n\n2. Compare the identified values with the claim:\n    - Series: 74 (from step 1)\n    - Season: 7 (from step 1)\n    - Writer: Amy Iglow (from step 1)\n\n3. Check if the identified values match the claim's given values:\n    - The series and season match, but the writer in the table is not exactly as in the claim (Amy Iglow vs Amy iglow). However, since the misspelling is minor and does not significantly alter the meaning of the name, we can assume that this is an error in the provided data.\n\n4. Finally, check the viewer count for the identified episode:\n    - In the table, we find the viewer count (us viewers) in row 7, column 5. The value is 7.19 million.
