Search through the table to find all rows where the \"team\" column matches ligier gitanes.\n3. Check if there are any multiple occurrences of ligier gitanes in a single year since the claim refers to points earned in a specific year (1989).\n4. Look at the points columns for the ligier gitanes rows to see if there is a value that matches 37.\n5. Verify that these points were earned in 1989 by checking that the \"year\" column in the relevant row(s) also equals 1989.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team from the claim: ligier gitanes\",\n    \"Search through the table for rows where 'team' matches ligier gitanes\",\n    \"Check if there are any multiple occurrences of ligier gitanes in a single year to avoid counting points twice\",\n    \"Look at the points columns for the ligier gitanes rows\",\n    \"Verify that these points were earned in 1989 by checking the 'year' column in the relevant row(s)\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that a Renault v10 engine was used during 2 races in 1991.\n\n2. Find relevant years and engines: Narrow down the table to only the rows where the year is 1991 and the engine is a Renault v10. This will give us two teams, Williams and Ligier, as both had cars with Renault v10 engines in that year.\n\n3. Check for multiple appearances of these teams: To find out if a Renault v10 engine was used during 2 races in 1991, we need to see if either Williams or Ligier appear more than once in the table for that year.\n\n4. Analyze the results: In the year 1991, both teams appear twice (once for each car model). So, each team used a Renault v10 engine in one race. However, neither team appears to have used a Renault v10 engine in two separate races within the same year.\n\n5. Draw the conclusion: The claim is FALSE as a Renault v10 engine was not used during 2 races in 1991.\n\nThe final answer will be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Find relevant years and engines\", \"Check for multiple appearances of these teams\", \"Analyze the results\", \"Draw the conclusion\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"engine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"engine\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
