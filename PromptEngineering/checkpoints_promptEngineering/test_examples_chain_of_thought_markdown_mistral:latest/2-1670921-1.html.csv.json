    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, identify the rows in the table where the batting partner(s) include Mahela Jayawardene. In our table, rows 3, 4, and 6 match this criterion.\n\n2. Next, determine the venue for each of these matches. For row 3, it's Colombo; for row 4, Karachi; and for row 6, Ahmedabad.\n\n3. Now compare the venues to find if there's a match between any pair that took place in Karachi. Only the fourth row corresponds to Karachi.\n\n4. Finally, check if the runs scored by Mahela Jayawardene in these matches (in this case, Thilan Samaraweera) are 437 runs exactly. For the fourth row, they indeed score 437 runs.\n\nBased on our analysis:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find rows where Mahela Jayawardene is a batting partner\",\n    \"Narrow down to matches with the same venue (Karachi)\",\n    \"Confirm if the runs scored by Mahela Jayawardene in that match are 437\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"runs\" }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to answer the claim:\n\n1. Identify the claim's subject and target: The subject of the claim is \"mahela jayawardene and thilan samaraweera\" and the target is the runs they scored together.\n2. Verify if the table contains a row with the batting partners as \"mahela jayawardene and thilan samaraweera\": Yes, there is such a row (4th row).\n3. Check if the number of runs in that row matches the target number (195): No, the number of runs in the 4th row (with wicket 4) is 437, not 195.\n4. Since the number of runs in the given row does not match the claim's target number and there are no other rows with the same batting partners, the claim is false.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Step 1: Identify the subject (batting partners) and target (runs together)\",\n    \"Step 2: Verify if the table contains a row with the specified batting partners\",\n    \"Step 3: Check if the number of runs in that row matches the target number\",\n    \"Step 4: Compare the result of step 3 with the claim's target number\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wicket\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"runs\" }\n  ]\n}",
