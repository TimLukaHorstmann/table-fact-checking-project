In this case, it's the last column, which doesn't have a header but includes numerical values.\n2. To find the game with the lowest attendance, we compare the attendance numbers for each row and select the one with the smallest value.\n3. The rows have valid attendance data (non-NaN values) except for the row 5, as it has no date or opponent specified. Since we can't consider this row in our comparison, we only consider the other 16 rows.\n4. After comparing all the valid rows (except row 5), we find that the smallest attendance value is in row 14: `43363`.\n5. Check which stadium corresponds to this lowest attendance value. In this case, it's alltel stadium because the relevant cell for this game (row 14 and column \"stadium\") has the value `alltel stadium`.\n\nSince we found that the game with the smallest attendance was played at alltel stadium, our final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the attendance column\",\n    \"Find the game with the smallest attendance in the table\",\n    \"Check which stadium corresponds to this game\",\n    ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"}\n    ]\n}\n```",
