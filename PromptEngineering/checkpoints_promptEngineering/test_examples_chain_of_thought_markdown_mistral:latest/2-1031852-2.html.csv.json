Identify the manager and season for which the post-season record needs to be checked, as stated in the claim: The manager is \"brian buchanan\" and the season is \"2013\".\n\n2. Search through the table for a row with the manager's name \"brian buchanan\" and the season \"2013\".\n\n3. Observe that there is a row in the table with the manager's name \"brian buchanan\" and the season \"2013\", but the post-season record column (marked as 'post - season record') for this row is empty, indicating that there was no post-season record for this team.\n\n4. Compare the observed result with the claim: The claim stated that Kansas City has no post-season record in 2013. Since the table indicates that there was indeed no post-season record (as it's empty), the claim is consistent with the facts presented in the table.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Check manager and season from the claim\", \"Search for a row matching the provided manager and season\", \"Observe that the post-season record column is empty for the matching row\", \"Compare the observed result with the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"}, {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"manager\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to understand what the table represents. It shows the record of managers for various seasons in Houston, including their win percentage (win %), post-season record, post-season win percentage, MLB affiliate, and a symbol (\u2666) denoting playoff appearances.\n\n2. The claim is \"Houston have no post-season record\".\n\n3. We need to check if there are any rows in the table with non-empty values for both \"post - season record\" and \"post - season win %\".\n\n4. In the given table, we don't find any such rows where both \"post - season record\" and \"post - season win %\" have a value (either numeric or symbol).
