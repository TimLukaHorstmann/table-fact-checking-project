    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to identify all the rows where the opponent team is 'san diego chargers'. This can be found in the \"opponent\" column. In our table, it appears once at row index 3.\n2. Next, we need to find the corresponding attendance for each game where the opponent is 'san diego chargers'. This is provided in the \"attendance\" column. For this team, it's 13000, which can be found in row index 3.\n\nNow let's consider the claim: \"before week 6, attendance at san diego charger game total 13000\". Since week 6 is at row index 6 and our 'san diego chargers' game attendance is at row index 3, we can compare these two rows (week and attendance) to determine if the claim is true or false.\n\nHere's the output in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows where opponent is 'san diego chargers'.\",\n    \"Find the corresponding attendance for each game where the opponent is 'san diego chargers'.\",\n    \"Compare the attendance at the 'san diego chargers' game (week 3) with week 6 to determine if the claim is true or false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" }\n  ]\n}",
