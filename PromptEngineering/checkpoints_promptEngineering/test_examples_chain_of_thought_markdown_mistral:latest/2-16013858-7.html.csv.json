The dates seem to be sequential for two weeks (11th to 20th June, then 25th to 17th July), which suggests it could be a single season but more data is needed to confirm this. However, since no specific year is given in the table, we cannot definitively say if it represents the 2001 season.\n\n2. Next, let's check if there are matches decided in three sets or less. From the table, you can see that each row indicates a match with five sets played (set 1 to set 5). To determine if a match was decided in three sets or less, we look for rows where any of the first four sets resulted in a win for both teams (indicating a straight-set win), and the total score in those three sets is less than the total score in all five sets.\n\n3. Now, let's check if there are 14 such matches:\n   - For example, let's look at the match on jun 11: Score is 3-0, but the total for set 1 (25-15) plus set 2 (25-21) and set 3 (25-23) is already greater than the total score for all five sets (75 - 59). Therefore, this match does not count towards our requirement.\n   - Similarly, we can check the other matches one by one and find that none of them have three sets with a combined score less than the total score of all five sets.\n\n4.

Next, count the number of such instances (i.e., rows) where the score is 3 - 0. From the table provided, there are 6 instances of a final score of 3 - 0.\n\n3.

Since there are 6 instances where the score is 3 - 0 and 21 instances where it's not, we calculate the difference between these two numbers to see if any other scores combine for more wins than the 3-0 score has individually. The result of this calculation shows that the 3 - 0 score has a higher number of wins (6) compared to all other scores combined (21).\n\n5. Lastly, we need to ensure that the condition \"except 1 - 3\" is met. To verify this, count the number of instances where the score is 1 - 3. From the table provided, there are 4 instances of a final score of 1 - 3. By adding these 4 instances (1-3 wins) to the total number of instances where it's not 3 - 0 (21 instances), we find that this combination still has fewer wins than the 3-0 score (6 + 21 = 27, which is less than 3-0's 6 wins).\n\nWith all the steps completed, let us now present our final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find instances where the score was 3 - 0\",\n    \"Count the number of such instances (i.e., rows)\",\n    \"Calculate the total number of instances where the scores are not 3 - 0\",\n    \"Compare the number of instances where the score is 3 - 0 with all other scores combined\",\n    \"Verify that the condition 'except 1 - 3' is met\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}",
