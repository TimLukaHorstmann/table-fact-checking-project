    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the claim: After 2012, the winner's share was never less than $15000.\n\n2. Next, we compare each row's \"year\" column with 2012 (the year before which the claim is referring to). If the year is greater than 2012, we check the \"winner 's share\" column for a value less than or equal to $15000.\n\n3. We traverse through the table row by row starting from the second row (since the first row contains headers):\n    - For row index 2 (year = 2011), the winner's share is $14000, which is less than $15000, so the claim is false for this year.\n    - For row index 3 (year = 2012), the winner's share is $15000, so the claim holds true for this year.\n    - For the remaining rows, the winner's share is always greater than or equal to $15000.\n\n4. The final answer can be determined by checking if there are any violations of the claim in the table.
