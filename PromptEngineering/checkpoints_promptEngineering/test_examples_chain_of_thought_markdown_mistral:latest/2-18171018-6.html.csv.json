    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Identify the player for whom we want to find the placing - in this case, it's Gil Morgan.\n2. Check the table row corresponding to Gil Morgan (row 10). The place is not provided but we can see he has a score of 211 (-2 to par).\n3. Compare his score with others in the table. To do this, find all players who have the same score as Gil Morgan (-2 to par).\n4. Check for any rows where the player's country is the same as Gil Morgan (United States). Since all ties share the same position, it is enough to check one of them.\n5. Look at the rows with the same score and country as Gil Morgan. There is one such row: gil morgan (row 10) himself.\n6. Confirm that he shares the same place in the table as the others with -2 to par, which means they are tied for the placing indicated by their relative position in the table. In this case, they are tied for 7th place.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the player (Gil Morgan) and find its row\",\n    \"Check the score of the player (-2 to par)\",\n    \"Compare the score with others in the table\",\n    \"Find all players who have the same score as Gil Morgan (-2 to par)\",\n    \"Check for any rows where the player's country is the same as Gil Morgan (United States)\",\n    \"Confirm that they share the same place in the table and are tied\",\n    \"Conclude that Gil Morgan represents the United States and ties for 7th place with -2 to par\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
