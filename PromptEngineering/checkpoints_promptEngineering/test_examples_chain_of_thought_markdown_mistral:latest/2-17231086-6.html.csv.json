Next, count the total number of players in the table. There are 12 players.\n3. To determine if a majority is from the United States, we need to find out whether more than half of the players are from that country. In this case, since there are three under-par players and nine others (which can be considered \"above par\" or not under par), having more than half would mean having more than six players (i.e., 12/2 = 6).\n4.

Since there's only one player from Japan with a score of 281, and we are asked to calculate the average score, I can deduce that the average score for players from Japan would simply be the individual score (281) divided by the number of players (1).
