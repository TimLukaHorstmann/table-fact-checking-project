Identify the columns that contain information about episodes: 'no in series', 'no in season', 'title', 'directed by', 'written by', 'original airdate', 'production code'.\n2. Since we are looking for the 15th episode of the third season, first find the episodes of the third season by filtering the table based on the 'no in season' column equal to 3. This will give us a subset of the original table.\n3. Then, sort this subset of the table in ascending order by the 'no in series' column to arrange the episodes chronologically within the third season.\n4. Identify the row where the value in the 'no in series' column is equal to 15. This will give us the episode we are looking for.\n5.

Each row contains information about a specific episode, including its title, director, writer, original airdate, production code, and their corresponding positions within the series and season.\n\n3. Find the relevant rows related to season 3: Since we are looking for episode 12 of season 3, we need to find the row where \"no in season\" is equal to 12. However, there's no such row in our table since seasons start from 1. Therefore, our claim does not correspond to any row in this table.\n\n4.

This gives us episode 29 + 3 = episode 32.\n\n2. Next, we find the production code for this episode by looking at the row that corresponds to episode 32 in the table (since the no in series column indicates the order of episodes within a season).

Determine the relevant columns for this claim: Since we are looking for the director of episode 12 in season 3, the relevant columns are 'no in season', 'directed by'.\n4. Identify the row of interest: Episode 12 is not explicitly stated in the table, but considering that seasons typically have 13 episodes and counting from season 3, episode 12 would correspond to row 12 (as the 12th number in a series starting from 1). However, since the table doesn't show all episodes, it is not possible to definitively identify the row of interest without more information.\n5. Check if there is any inconsistency or ambiguity in the claim: The claim does not mention the season number explicitly, but it is generally assumed that when referring to \"episode 12\", it is in the context of a particular series or season. In this table, it seems that the episodes are ordered by their production code, which could correspond to season and episode numbers (e.g., 306 for season 3, episode 6).\n6.
