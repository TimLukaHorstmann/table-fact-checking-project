If the wining team's score is less than the losing team's score by less than 10 points, then the claim is true. The score in row 3 shows a victory for New Orleans (w 87 - 78 (ot)). To find out if the difference is less than 10 points, subtract the winning team's score from the losing team's score: 100 (Lakers) - 87 (New Orleans) = 13. Since 13 is not less than 10, this is not the game where the Lakers won by less than 10 points.\n\n3. To confirm that we found the correct game in the table, check if row 3 has the date \"April 22\" and the location \"staples center 18997\". Both these conditions are met, so our search for the game on April 22 is valid.\n\n4.

In this case, it's the fourth row (index 3).\n3. Look at the \"team\" column for the team of the player whose points we are interested in (kobe bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers).

Compare kobe bryant's points for this game (17) with other rows in the table to see if there is a higher value among kobe bryant's games. We notice that the highest value for kobe bryant's points is indeed 34 (on April 17), which is higher than 17.\n6. To verify whether the claim mentions a second-highest value, we look for another row in the table where kobe bryant has scored the same number of points as he did on April 24 (17). We do not find any such rows.\n7. Since the claim states that kobe bryant had his team high in points on April 24, which is true for this game, and it also mentions a second-highest value (without specifying whether it needs to be exact or just within the same value), we must verify if there is another row where kobe bryant scored the highest number of points.
