First, I identify the claim's two main components: the year (1988) and the class (250cc), as well as the comparison between the points scored in these years (221 vs 78).\n\n2. Next, I look for the relevant rows in the table that match the provided year and class from the claim to see if there is a corresponding number of points. This will allow me to verify the validity of the first part of the claim (221 points in 1988 for the 250cc class).\n\n3. In this table, I find one relevant row for the year 1988 and the class 250cc (row_index=4), with a value of 221 for the \"points\" column. This indicates that the player indeed scored 221 points in 1988 for the 250cc class, as claimed.\n\n4. Now, I repeat the same process to see if there is any row that matches the year (1989) and the class (250cc) from the claim, to verify the second part of the claim (78 points in 1989 for the 250cc class).\n\n5. In this table, I find one relevant row for the year 1989 and the class 250cc (row_index=6), with a value of 98 for the \"points\" column. This indicates that the player scored 98 points in 1989 for the 250cc class, which is not the same as the number claimed (78).\n\nGiven these findings, I will provide the following JSON response:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the year and class from the claim\", \"Find relevant rows in the table that match the provided year and class\", \"Verify if the points scored in those years match the claimed values\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}",
