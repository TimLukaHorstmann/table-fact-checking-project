Find out which team was the leader's team in each race by matching the winner's team with the 'leader's team' column.\n   - Row 8 shows that Quick Step - Davitamon was the leader's team in Z\u00fcri - Metzgete (paolo bettini won and he is from the same team).\n   - Row 10 does not provide information about the leader's team for Paris - Tours, but we can proceed with the assumption that teams remain constant for each rider throughout the season.\n4.

Since Paris - Tours does not have information about the leader's team, we cannot confirm if Quick Step - Davitamon was the leader's team.
