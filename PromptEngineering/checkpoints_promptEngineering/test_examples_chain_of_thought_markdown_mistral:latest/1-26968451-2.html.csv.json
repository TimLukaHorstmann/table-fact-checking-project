    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The table provides information about various series, seasons, titles, directors, writers, and original air dates.\n2. To determine whether the claim \"michael lembeck directed series number 39\" is true or false, we need to find a row where the director is \"michael lembeck\" and the series number (as a row index) is 39.\n3. We start by looking at the series column to find the series numbers. The table doesn't have a series column that shows explicit numbers, but based on the pattern of increasing numbers in the first column (which seems to be related to the TV shows), we can infer that each row represents a different series.\n4. We then look for the director by checking if the \"directed by\" column matches \"michael lembeck\".\n5. By inspecting the table, we find a row where the \"directed by\" column equals \"michael lembeck\" and the title is \"flying solo\". The row index of this series is 39.\n6. Therefore, since the director of the series number 39 (row index) is indeed michael lembeck, our final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find the series numbers from the table, check if there's a row where the 'directed by' column equals 'michael lembeck', and find the corresponding series number for this row.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 39, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"}]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to verify the claim:\n1. Identify the series number 39 from the table. In this case, it corresponds to the row with index 38 (as the first row has index 0).\n2. Check the column \"written by :\" for the identified series number. The value in this cell for series number 39 is \"leslie rieder\", which is not equal to \"michael lembeck\".\n3. Since the written by value does not match with michael lembeck, it means that series number 39 was not written by michael lembeck.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer in a valid JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify series number 39 from the table\",\n    \"Check the 'written by :' column for the identified series number\",\n    \"Compare the value in the 'written by :' cell with 'michael lembeck'\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 38, \"column_name\": \"written by :\" }\n  ]\n}",
