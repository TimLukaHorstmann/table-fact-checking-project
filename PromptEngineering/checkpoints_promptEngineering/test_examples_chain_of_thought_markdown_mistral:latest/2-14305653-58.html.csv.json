From the filtered rows, check if any of the results match the format specified in the claim (a score of 2:1).\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row 1: {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"city\"} - This is where we find that the Yugoslavian team played in Sarajevo.\n- Row 2: {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"city\"} - This is where we find that the Yugoslavian team played in Belgrade.\n- Row 3: {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"city\"} - This is where we find that the Yugoslavian team played in Borovo.\n- Row 4 and Row 5 do not provide information about cities, but since they involve Romania (an opponent from rows with a city for the Yugoslavian team), we consider them relevant.\n\nSince there are multiple rows where the team is Yugoslavia, we cannot make a definitive conclusion based on the provided table alone. However, it seems that some of the games played by the Yugoslavian national team were friendly matches and others were part of the 1982 World Cup Qualifier (wcq). If we assume that the claim refers only to friendly matches, then the claim is FALSE since there are no rows in the table indicating a win by the score of 2:1 in friendly matches for the Yugoslavian national team.\n\nHowever, if we consider all matches, regardless of the type of game, then the claim can be verified TRUE because there is one row with the results \"2:1\" for a match involving the Yugoslavian national team (Row 0).\n\nIn summary, the final answer depends on whether the claim refers to friendly matches or all games.
