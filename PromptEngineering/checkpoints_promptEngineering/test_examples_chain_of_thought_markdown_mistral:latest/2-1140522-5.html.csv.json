If we assume the claim to be true, then the power output of the 'frs - 16' model in 'b - b' wheel arrangement built in 1952 should have been provided somewhere in the table.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the specific row that corresponds to the given criteria in the table. The claim mentions a `ff20 prr class` built in `1952`, but it doesn't mention the wheel arrangement or the builders model, so we will ignore these for now.\n\n2. In the table, there are two rows with `ff20 prr class` and at least one of them is built in 1952 (rows 3 and 4). We'll consider both these rows as potential matches.\n\n3. To find a match for the claim, we now need to check if either of these rows has a `wheel arrangement` of `b - b`. In row 3, the `wheel arrangement` is `a1a - a1a`, which doesn't match the requirement. However, in row 4, the `wheel arrangement` is not specified, so it could potentially match `b - b` (since we don't have any information to contradict this possibility).\n\n4. The claim also mentions \"power of ... build in 1952,\" but the table does not provide power output for that specific year. Instead, the table gives total produced which might give us a clue about the power if the production number is tied to power output (this isn't stated explicitly, so we can only assume this relation).\n\n5. Since we cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim without more information about the relationship between the `total produced` and `power output`, I would recommend checking additional data sources or clarifying with the provider of the table to get a conclusive answer.\n\n   Output:\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\n       \"Identify specific row that corresponds to the given criteria\",\n       \"Consider both potential matches (rows 3 and 4)\",\n       \"Check if either row has wheel arrangement of b - b\",\n       \"Confirm or deny claim based on power output and total produced relationship\"\n     ],\n     \"answer\": \"INSUFFICIENT_DATA\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wheel arrangement\" },\n       { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wheel arrangement\" }\n     ]\n   }",
