A set of back-to-back games means two games played on consecutive days.\n2. Scan through the table and identify any pairs of games that are separated by only one day (in terms of the \"date\" column).\n3. Look for game dates where the difference between them is exactly 1 day. In this case, that would mean looking at game dates that share a month and a year but have consecutive day numbers.\n4. Check if there are any pairs of games that meet these conditions. If we find two such pairs, then we can verify the claim.\n\nNow let's analyze each pair of games:\n\n1) Game 36 (January 4) and Game 37 (January 5): The difference in dates is exactly 1 day, so these are back-to-back games.\n2) Game 40 (January 13) and Game 41 (January 15): The difference in dates is exactly 2 days, not 1, so these are not back-to-back games.\n3) Game 42 (January 18) and Game 43 (January 20): The difference in dates is exactly 2 days, not 1, so these are not back-to-back games.\n4) Game 48 (January 29) and Game 49 (January 30): The difference in dates is exactly 2 days, not 1, so these are not back-to-back games.\n\nNow let's verify the claim:\n\n- There are two pairs of back-to-back games found: Games 36 and 37, and Games 42 and 43. However, only one pair needs to be considered because we are looking for a set of two consecutive sets of back-to-back games.\n- The first pair (Games 36 and 37) does not have another pair immediately following it. Therefore, the second pair (Games 42 and 43) is the only relevant set of consecutive pairs.\n\nThe claim states that there is a set of two back-to-back games on January 4 through the 5th, and another set on January 22 through the 23rd.
