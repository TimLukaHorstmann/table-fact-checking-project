No such rows exist in the provided table as the earliest date is 1973 (Row 2) and the latest date is 2008 (Row 6).\n3. Calculate the frequency of each type within the filtered range: '4wdh' appears once (Row 2) and 'bo - bodh' also appears once (Row 1).\n4. Compare the frequency of both types to determine if 'type 4wdh' is used more often than 'type bo - bodh'. In this case, 'type 4wdh' is used once, while 'type bo - bodh' is also used once. Since neither count exceeds the other, they cannot be considered as one being used more often than the other within the specified range.\n5.
