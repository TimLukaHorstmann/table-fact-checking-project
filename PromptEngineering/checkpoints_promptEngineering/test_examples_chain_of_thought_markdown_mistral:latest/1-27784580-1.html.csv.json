Find the row number of the episode with the earliest broadcast date. In our example, that would be row index 1 (since the first row is for ep 1 and we want the one with the earliest broadcast date).\n3. Identify the title of the next episode in the table (in this case, it's '\u3042\u308a\u3048\u306a\u3044\u30ad\u30b9', which is on row index 2).\n4. Determine if there are any gaps between the given dates to check for a 7-day difference. In our example, the gap between the broadcast dates of episodes 1 and 2 is not exactly 7 days.\n5. Compare the broadcast date of the identified next episode (episode 2) with the expected date if there was a 7-day gap after the earliest broadcast date (May 17 , 2010 should be the expected date for a 7-day gap). In our example, May 17 , 2010 is not equal to the actual broadcast date of episode 2 (May 17 , 2010).\n6. Based on the comparison made in step 5, determine whether the claim is true or false.
