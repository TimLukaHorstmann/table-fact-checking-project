Determine the number of games played by ipatinga: The table shows that the position of ipatinga is 20, so we can see from the table that it has played 38 games (since the row header indicates game positions).\n2. Count the number of losses suffered by ipatinga: From the table, we can see that in row 20, ipatinga has lost 21 games against other teams.\n3. Check if ipatinga has drawn more than 8 games: In the same row (20), it is indicated that ipatinga drew 8 games. To determine whether it drew more than 8 games, we simply compare this number to the one obtained in step 3 (which is 21).\n4. Compare the results from steps 2 and 3: If the number of losses (21) is greater than the number of draws (8), then it means ipatinga has lost more than 14 games and drawn less than 8 games, as required by the claim.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Determine the number of games played by ipatinga\",\n    \"Count the number of losses suffered by ipatinga\",\n    \"Check if ipatinga has drawn more than 8 games\",\n    \"Compare the results from steps 2 and 3\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"lost\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"drawn\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Check if ipatinga played less than 30 games: To find out how many games ipatinga played, check the 'played' column in the table. For ipatinga, this value is also found in row 20 and is 38.

Check if ipatinga lost 17 games: In the 'lost' column for ipatinga (row 20), we find that they have played and lost 21 games.
