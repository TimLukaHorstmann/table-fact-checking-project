    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that Toronto lost to Cleveland on November 24, 20XX (overtime).\n\n2. Look for a row in the table that matches the given date and teams (Toronto and Cleveland):\n   - If we find such a row, then look at the 'score' column to confirm if it shows a loss for Toronto.\n   - If no row is found, then the claim is false as there is no game on November 24 between Toronto and Cleveland in this table.\n\n3. Scroll through the table to find the row with 'team' equal to 'toronto' and 'location attendance' equal to 'air canada centre', since that's where the Toronto Raptors play their home games, and look at the 'date'.\n\n4. Find the next row (in sequence) with 'team' equal to 'cleveland' and 'location attendance' equal to a stadium other than 'air canada centre' or any non-numeric value for 'location attendance', since it is unlikely that both teams play in the same location in consecutive games.\n\n5. Compare the dates of these two rows to find out if they are consecutive and, if so, confirm if the difference is equal to November 24 (or one team's date minus the other gives November 24).\n\n6. If the dates match (either directly or by subtracting), look at the 'score' column in the row for Cleveland to see if it indicates a win for them and a loss for Toronto.\n\n7. Based on the findings from steps 3-6, determine whether the claim is true or false.\n\n   Here is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim's components (team, date, and score).\",\n                          \"Look for a row with 'team' = Toronto and 'location attendance' = air canada centre.\",\n                          \"Find the next row with 'team' = Cleveland.\",\n                          \"Compare the dates to see if they are consecutive.\",\n                          \"Check if the difference between dates is equal to November 24.\",\n                          \"If dates match, check the score column for a loss by Toronto.\"],\n     \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n                        {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n                        {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n                        {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n                        {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]\n   }",
