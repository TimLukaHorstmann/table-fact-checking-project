Check the population values: Pennfield has a population of 2322, while Saint Stephen has a population of 2113.\n4. Calculate the difference between the two populations: 2322 - 2113 = 209.\n5. Since the result is positive (209), if we want to find out whether pennfield's parish has a population of 219 more than saint stephen's parish, we should add 219 to the difference calculated in step 4. However, since the original claim doesn't include the word \"more\", we are actually looking for whether the population of pennfield is at least 219 greater than that of saint stephen.\n6. Check if the result (209 + 219 = 428) is greater than or equal to the difference between the populations of pennfield and saint stephen (which is 209).
