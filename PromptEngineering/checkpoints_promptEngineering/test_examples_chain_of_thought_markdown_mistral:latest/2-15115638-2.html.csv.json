Given that the claim's date matches the one in the second row of the table (May 29, 1977 is a day before May 30, 1982), we can compare this specific row to check if it satisfies the claim.\n2. Next, we need to verify whether the margin of victory listed for this tournament matches the one specified in the claim. In the table, the second row shows that the margin of victory for the lady keystone open on May 29, 1977 was 1 stroke.\n3.
