In this case, it's the \"navajo indian reservation.\"\n\n2. Check if there is any row in the table related to the \"navajo indian reservation\" for the year 1979. The relevant cell for this step would be at row_index = 1 and column_name = \"1979\".\n\n3. Compare the value of the identified cell with the given threshold (54.2). In this case, the value in the cell is higher than 54.2, which is 47.3.\n\nThe reasoning process can be summarized as follows:\n\n- The reservation of interest is the \"navajo indian reservation\" located in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah.\n- In the year 1979, the population for this reservation was 47.3.\n- This number is higher than the given threshold (54.2), which means that the claim is FALSE.\n\nHowever, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the provided claim as it asks about a condition where the population should be \"higher than 54.2\" but in the year 1979 for Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah (which is the \"navajo indian reservation\"), the population was lower than 54.2.\n\nTo provide a valid JSON response, we'll provide the reasoning process but mark the final answer as FALSE since the claim is not accurate given the provided table data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the reservation that falls within Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah\",\n    \"Check if there is any row in the table related to the 'navajo indian reservation' for the year 1979\",\n    \"Compare the value of the identified cell with the given threshold (54.2)\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"1979\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Check the values for these rows in the 2000 column of the table. The values are 46.5 (navajo), 52.6 (san carlos), and 52.8 (pine ridge).
