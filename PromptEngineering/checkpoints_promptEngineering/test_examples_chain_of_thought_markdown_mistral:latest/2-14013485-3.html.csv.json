Compare the earliest year for each coach to determine if FE Schofield started coaching earlier than any other coach: By looking at the \"years\" column, we can see that FE Schofield's tenure started in 1909. To find out if anyone started coaching earlier, we would need to check the row_index of each coach (the first row index is 1 for this table).\n5. Check the row_indices of coaches with only one row: Since FE Schofield has only one row and it starts in 1909, there are no other rows with an earlier start year to compare to.\n6.
