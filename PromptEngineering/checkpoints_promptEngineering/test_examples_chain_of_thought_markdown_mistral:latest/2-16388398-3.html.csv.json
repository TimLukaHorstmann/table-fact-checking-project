Then, I identify which teams are the away teams in these matches. To do this, I find out the opponent of each St Kilda match. In the second and fourth rows, Melbourne is the opponent. In the fifth row, it's Adelaide, but since we already found two instances where Melbourne is the away team when playing against St Kilda, we don't need to consider this third instance further.\n3. Finally, I compare the found instances with the given claim. The claim states that Melbourne should be the away team when the home team is St Kilda.
