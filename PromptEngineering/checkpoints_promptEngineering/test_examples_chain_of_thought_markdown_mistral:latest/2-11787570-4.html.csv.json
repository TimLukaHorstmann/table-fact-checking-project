We can assume all players listed here are the ones from the Rattlers team since there's no other context provided.\n\n2. To check if any player had an average over 10 yards per reception, we will look at the \"avg\" column to find players with a value greater than 10. The players who meet this condition are Trandon Harvey, Jeremiah Pope, Atnaf Harris, and Kevin McKenzie.\n\n3. However, we also need to consider the second part of the claim: \"2 with only 2 yard\". This suggests that there should be two players who had an average of exactly 2 yards per reception.\n\n4. We can find these players by looking for rows where both \"avg\" is equal to 2 and the player's name (row index) isn't among the ones found in step 2 (i.e., it shouldn't be a player who had an average over 10 yards per reception). The players that meet this condition are Craig Moore, William Fields, Zach Rupp, Albrey Battle, Vince Amey.\n\n5. After examining the relevant cells for these six players (Craig Moore, William Fields, Zach Rupp, Albrey Battle, Vince Amey, and Justin Taplin since he was mentioned in step 4 but doesn't meet the condition), we can see that Craig Moore has an average of exactly 2 yards per reception.\n\n6.
