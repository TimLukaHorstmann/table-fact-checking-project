Next, we check if there are any other players in the table with the same score as 'nick price' (row_index 9). By comparing the 'score' column, we see that all players have different scores.\n4.

In this table, the score column shows the total scores after each round and the to par column shows the number of strokes above par for that player. The player with the lowest total score will have the highest negative value in the to par column.\n\n2. Compare the to par values for all players in the table. In this case, Mark Brooks (-11) and Kenny Perry (-11) have the same to par value, indicating they have the lowest scores.\n\n3. Since we are comparing who tied for having the lowest to par, it doesn't matter that there might be other players with the same total score but a different number of strokes above or below par.\n\n4. As a final check, verify that Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry are indeed in a tie for the lowest to par by comparing their scores in the table. They are both listed in the first two rows with a score of 277 and -11 to par, confirming they are tied.\n\nThe relevant cells for this analysis are:\n- {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"} (Mark Brooks)\n- {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"} (Kenny Perry)\n- {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"} (Mark Brooks' to par value)\n- {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"to par\"} (Kenny Perry's to par value)\n\nThe final answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify players with the lowest score (taking into account deviation from par), compare their to par values, and verify that they are indeed in a tie for the lowest to par by comparing their scores.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}]\n}",
