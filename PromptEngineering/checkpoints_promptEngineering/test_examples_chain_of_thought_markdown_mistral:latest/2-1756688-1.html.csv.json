Therefore, Nathan Ablett played for Geelong for 4 seasons.\n3. Next, we need to check if he played for 3 years. To do this, we convert the number of seasons into years since one season equals four quarters (or 24 weeks). So, 4 seasons equal 16 weeks * 4 = 64 weeks. Since a year has approximately 52 weeks, we divide the total weeks by 52 to find out how many full years he played for Geelong, which gives us 1.23 years. However, since you cannot have a fraction of a year, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1 year.\n4.
