Looking at the 'crowd' column, we find collingwood had 34000 spectators and richmond had 14.13 (97), so it does not have a crowd value yet. To compare, Essendon vs Fitzroy had 17500, Melbourne vs South Melbourne had 23025, St Kilda vs North Melbourne had 20500, and Hawthorn vs Footscray had 26000 spectators.\n2. Collingwood played against Richmond in the third row of the table.\n3. Now that we have identified the game (Collingwood vs Richmond), we check its crowd value which is 34000. We see that this is higher than any other crowd values found in step 1, so it has the largest crowd among all games in the table.",

Start by reading the table to understand its structure and content, where each row represents a match played on the same day in 1954 between different AFL (Australian Rules Football) teams. The table includes details such as team names, scores, venue, crowd size, and date.\n\n2. To evaluate the claim, we need to find out which team scored the most points in a single match. Points are calculated by adding the home team's score and away team's score for each match (as both teams contribute to the total points).\n\n3. Examine each row of the table:\n   - Melbourne vs South Melbourne: 15.21 (111) + 14.5 (89) = 196\n   - Essendon vs Fitzroy: 22.13 (145)\n   - Collingwood vs Richmond: 11.8 (74) + 14.13 (97) = 191\n   - Carlton vs Geelong: 12.20 (92) + 11.16 (82) = 194\n   - St Kilda vs North Melbourne: 10.12 (72) + 9.24 (78) = 160\n   - Hawthorn vs Footscray: 10.9 (69) + 11.12 (78) = 177\n\n4. The row for Essendon vs Fitzroy has the highest total points, which is 22.13 (145) + 7.12 (54) = 199 points.\n\n5. Compare this result with other rows to confirm that it's indeed the maximum score in the table:\n   - 199 > 196 (Melbourne vs South Melbourne)\n   - 199 > 191 (Collingwood vs Richmond)\n   - 199 > 194 (Carlton vs Geelong)\n   - 199 > 160 (St Kilda vs North Melbourne)\n   - 199 > 177 (Hawthorn vs Footscray)\n\n6.
