To confirm whether he piloted the bluebird k7 on 14 May 1959, we need to search for a row where both 'pilot (s)' is 'donald campbell' and 'date' is '14 may 1959'.\n4. After searching through the table, we find that the relevant row is:\n\n| craft             | pilot (s)                           | location          | date              |\n|:------------------|:------------------------------------|:------------------|:------------------|\n| bluebird k7       | donald campbell                     | coniston water    | 14 may 1959       |\n\n5.
