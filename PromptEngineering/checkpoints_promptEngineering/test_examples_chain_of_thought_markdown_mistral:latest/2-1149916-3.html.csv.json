Look for a row in the table where the \"year\" column matches the specified year (1973).\n3. Check if there is a driver's name in the same row as the matching year.\n4. Determine whether the driver's name is Denny Hulme.\n5. If steps 2-4 are satisfied, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the year in the claim (1973); locate a row with the matching year; check if there's a driver's name; determine whether that driver's name is Denny Hulme.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"driver\"}]\n}",
