Find the row corresponding to the \"custom house tower\" in the table: The given table has a column labeled \"name\". The claim refers to the \"custom house tower\", so we find the row with this name. This row has a row index of 4.\n3. Determine the value of the \"floors\" column for the \"custom house tower\": The \"floors\" column is in the last column of the table. For the row with the index 4 (which corresponds to the \"custom house tower\"), we find that there are 32 floors.\n4. Calculate the number stated in the claim: The claim states that the custom house tower has 30 - 2 floors. If we subtract 2 from 30, we get 28, not 32 as found in step 3.\n5. Compare the calculated value with the table value: Comparing the calculated number (28) with the number in the table (32), they do not match.\n6. Output the final answer and relevant cells: Since the calculated number does not match the number in the table, the claim is FALSE.
