    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the context: The table provided shows the results of football matches from the Macedonian 2000 cup (assuming it's a typo and meant 2000 season). We are looking for teams that have a tie aggregate score in their matches.\n\n2. An aggregate score is the sum of goals scored by each team across two legs of a match. If the total goals for both games are equal, then the match (and therefore the aggregate) is tied.\n\n3. Let's scan the table row by row to find any ties:\n   - In the first row, Sloga Jugomagnat won 2-1 against Pobeda in the aggregate. So, no tie here.\n   - In the second row, Pelister and Sileks had a draw (5-5) in the first leg. However, Sileks won the second leg 3-5, making the aggregate score 8-10 for Sileks, so no tie here either.\n   - In the third row, Rabotni\u010dki and \u0160kendija hb had a draw (3-3) in the first leg after extra time, but Rabotni\u010dki won the second leg 1-2 (aet), making the aggregate score 4-5 for Rabotni\u010dki. No tie here.\n   - In the fourth row, Belasica beat Bregalnica \u0160tip 7-2 in the aggregate. No tie here.\n   - In the fifth row, Karaorman and Borec MHK had a draw (4-4) in the first leg. However, Borec MHK won the second leg 1-4, making the aggregate score 5-8 for Borec MHK. No tie here either.\n   - In the sixth row, Vardar beat Napredok 7-1 in the aggregate. No tie here.\n   - In the seventh row, Alumina lost to Ba\u0161kimi 2-4 in the aggregate. No tie here.\n   - In the eighth row, Cementarnica beat Mad\u017eari Solidarnost 8-0 in the aggregate.

    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the total score for the first leg of all games. In the table, we can see that each game consists of two teams playing against each other with a result reported for both teams (with the exception of one team where only aggregate score is provided). Each team from a game has a corresponding first leg score.\n\n2. Calculate the sum of the first leg scores for each game and then sum those results to obtain the total for all games in the 1st leg.\n\n3. Compare the calculated total with the claim's total to determine whether it matches or not.\n\nNow, let's find the relevant cells:\n\n- For each game, we are interested in the first leg scores of both teams (i.e., the agg column for team 1 and the 1st leg column for team 2). In case a team only has an aggregate score, we don't use that.\n\nWith this information, let's calculate the total for all games in the first leg:\n\n- For sloga jugomagnat vs pobeda, it is 2 (sloga's 1st leg score) + 0 (pobeda's 1st leg score) = 2\n- For pelister vs sileks, we can't calculate the first leg total as only aggregate scores are provided.\n- For rabotni\u010dki vs \u0161kendija hb, it is 3 (rabotni\u010dki's 1st leg score) + 2 (\u0161kendija hb's 1st leg score) = 5\n- For belasica vs bregalnica \u0161tip, it is 6 (belasica's 1st leg score) + 0 (bregalnica \u0161tip's 1st leg score) = 6\n- For karaorman vs borec mhk, we can't calculate the first leg total as only aggregate scores are provided.\n- For vardar vs napredok, it is 5 (vardar's 1st leg score) + 1 (napredok's 1st leg score) = 6\n- For alumina vs ba\u0161kimi, it is 1 (alumina's 1st leg score) + 0 (ba\u0161kimi's 1st leg score) = 1\n- For cementarnica vs mad\u017eari solidarnost, it is 2 (cementarnica's 1st leg score) + 6 (mad\u017eari solidarnost's 1st leg score) = 8\n\nNow, let's sum these scores:\n2 + 0 + 5 + 6 + 0 + 6 + 1 + 8 = 23\n\nThe calculated total for all games in the first leg is 23.

However, since there is a penalty shootout result for this match which makes the final score 2-1 (1-3 p) for Sloga Jugomagnat, this row does not satisfy the condition.\n   - Row index 5: Rabotni\u010dki (team 1) vs \u0160kendija HB (team 2), aggregate score: 3-3 (for Rabotni\u010dki) and 1-2 (for \u0160kendija HB).
