    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Count the number of wins by Usui from the table. We can see that there are 5 rows with \"win\" under the result column for Usui.\n2. For each win, identify the method of victory. To determine if a win is by majority decision or unanimous decision, we need to check the number of rounds and the number of judges' decisions. In MMA events like those listed in this table, it is common that when there are no knockouts or submissions during a match, the judges decide on the winner based on points scored throughout the fight (also called a decision).\n   - If all three judges agree on the winner, it is considered a unanimous decision.\n   - If two judges agree and the third judge has a different opinion, it is considered a majority decision.\n3. Analyze each win to check if it's by majority or unanimous decision.\n   - Row 4: The round value is 2, and there are three rows with \"win\" in this event (rows 4, 5, and 6). Checking the next row (row 5), we can see that another fighter also had a win in this same event (10-6-1 vs. Shinya Kumazawa). In an event with multiple fighters competing, it's possible for more than one decision to occur at the same time. Since there is no information about the judges' decisions, we cannot tell if it was a unanimous or majority decision. However, since the current claim asks for \"only 1 of Usui's win be by majority decision,\" and this particular fight has multiple winners without knowing their individual judge scores, we can ignore this event for now.\n   - Row 6: The round value is 2, and there are three rows with \"win\" in this event (rows 6, 7, and 8). Similar to the previous case, we cannot determine if it was a unanimous or majority decision since there is no information about the judges' decisions.\n   - Row 9: The round value is 2, and there are three rows with \"win\" in this event (rows 9, 10, and 11). Checking the next row (row 10), we can see that another fighter also had a win in this same event (8-6-1 vs. Daisuke Ishizawa). In an event with multiple fighters competing, it's possible for more than one decision to occur at the same time. Since there is no information about the judges' decisions, we cannot tell if it was a unanimous or majority decision. However, since the current claim asks for \"only 1 of Usui's win be by majority decision,\" and this particular fight has multiple winners without knowing their individual judge scores, we can ignore this event for now.\n   - Row 12: The round value is 2, and there are three rows with \"win\" in this event (rows 12, 13, and 14). Checking the next row (row 13), we can see that another fighter also had a win in this same event (2-3 vs. Seigi Fujioka). In an event with multiple fighters competing, it's possible for more than one decision to occur at the same time. Since there is no information about the judges' decisions, we cannot tell if it was a unanimous or majority decision. However, since the current claim asks for \"only 1 of Usui's win be by majority decision,\" and this particular fight has multiple winners without knowing their individual judge scores, we can ignore this event for now.\n   - Row 15: The round value is 2, and there are three rows with \"win\" in this event (rows 15, 16, and 17). Checking the next row (row 16), we can see that another fighter also had a win in this same event (2-3 vs. Takeshi Matsushita). In an event with multiple fighters competing, it's possible for more than one decision to occur at the same time. Since there is no information about the judges' decisions, we cannot tell if it was a unanimous or majority decision. However, since the current claim asks for \"only 1 of Usui's win be by majority decision,\" and this particular fight has multiple winners without knowing their individual judge scores, we can ignore this event for now.\n   - Row 18: The round value is not provided for this event (it's shown as N/A). There are only two wins in this event, one for Usui (1-0 vs. Takahiro Ogawa) and another for another fighter (2-0 vs. Tomoki Kawano). Since there are only two fighters competing in this event, there can be at most one decision, which is likely a unanimous decision since both fighters have different records.\n4. Review the analyzed wins: we found that for Usui's wins in events with multiple fighters, we don't have enough information to determine if they were by majority or unanimous decisions (rows 4, 6, 9, 12, and 15). For one event with only two fighters (row 18), it seems likely that the win for Usui was a unanimous decision.\n5.
