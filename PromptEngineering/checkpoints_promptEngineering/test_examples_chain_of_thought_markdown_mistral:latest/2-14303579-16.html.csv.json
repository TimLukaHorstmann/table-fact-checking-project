Identify the claim: The claim states that Dave Hynek and Robin Lang, from the given table, were both part of the 1976-77 Philadelphia Flyers and are from Canada.\n\n2. Determine the relevance of the data in the table: Since the table lists players, their positions, nationalities, and previous teams (some of which may not be accurate as they represent junior or club teams), we will focus on the nationality column to determine if Dave Hynek and Robin Lang are from Canada.\n\n3. Check each player's nationality:\n   - Dave Hynek is listed as being from Canada.\n   - Robin Lang, unfortunately, is not explicitly mentioned in the table.\n\n4.
