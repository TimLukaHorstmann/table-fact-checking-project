No driver is explicitly named, but we can infer it from the teams that were associated with him during 1985 and 1986. He raced for \"motor racing developments ltd\" in 1985 with a \"brabham bt54\" chassis, and there is no team named \"barclay arrows bmw\" before 1986. Therefore, the driver associated with this data is Marc Surer.\n\n2. Next, check if he scored points in both years. In 1985, the row corresponding to that year has a chassis of \"brabham bt54\" and the team is \"motor racing developments ltd\". This matches our driver Marc Surer. The points column for this row contains \"5\", so he scored 5 points in 1985.\n\n3. In 1986, there is a team named \"barclay arrows bmw\" but no corresponding data for Marc Surer. Therefore, we can conclude that he did not score any points in 1986.\n\n4.

No instance of scoring 0 points has a year less than any of these instances.\n4. Since there are no instances where \"arrows racing team\" or \"barclay nordica arrows bmw\" scored more than 4 points in fewer than 1 year, it can be deduced that they never scored 4 points in 1 year less than the instances when they scored 0 points.\n5.
