    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find the language where the word \"Saturday\" is being sought. In this case, it's Croatian, as indicated by the claim.\n2. Next, we look for the row in the table that corresponds to the Croatian language. This would be the 10th row.\n3. Then, we search for the day of the week in the 7th column (Saturday) within the row that corresponds to the Croatian language.\n4. Finally, we compare the result with \"subota\", which is the value found at the intersection of the 10th row and the 7th column.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find the language where 'Saturday' is sought (Croatian), locate the corresponding row, find the day of the week in the 7th column for that row, and compare with the value 'subota'.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"Saturday\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n   1. Identify the claim: The claim states that \"subota\" is the Mongolian word for Sunday.\n   2. Search for the row that contains the word \"Sunday\" in the \"English\" column. However, there is no direct translation of \"Sunday\" provided in the table. Instead, we have to find the day that corresponds to Sunday's position (7th day) in each language.\n   3. Find the row for Saturday (6th day in English), as it is the day before Sunday. In this table, the Russian word for Saturday is \"\u0441\u0443\u0431\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\" (subbota).\n   4. Compare the found word \"\u0441\u0443\u0431\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\" with each Mongolian translation of the days, since the claim suggests that the Mongolian word for Sunday should be the same as \"subota\".\n   5. In the Mongolian row, there are two columns: one for numerical order and another for Tibetan order. Check both columns for a matching word.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim\", \"Find day before Sunday (Saturday)\", \"Search Mongolian words for days\", \"Compare found Russian word '\u0441\u0443\u0431\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430' with Mongolian words\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"English\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 19,\n      \"column_name\": \"Russian\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"Mongolian (numerical)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"Mongolian (Tibetan)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
