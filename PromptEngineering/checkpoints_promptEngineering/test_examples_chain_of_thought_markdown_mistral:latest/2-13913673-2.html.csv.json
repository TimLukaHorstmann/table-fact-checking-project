There are three such occurrences: April 23, April 24 for both the Royals and Yankees games, and April 25 for the Yankees game.\n3. Note that on April 24, there were two games against the Royals (one at 9 - 6 and another at 2 - 0). Both of these games occurred after the postponed game from April 23. This means that the April 24 games are not replacements for the postponed game on April 23, but separate games in their own right.\n4. Since there were two games on April 24 that were played and recorded (and not postponed), it is clear that only one game was actually postponed during the season: the April 23 match against the Royals.\n5.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n   1. We are looking for a match where the score is 7 - 2.\n   2. Go through each row of the table, starting from the first (march 31) and comparing the 'score' column with the target (7 - 2).\n   3. For the first two rows, the opponent is the white sox, and both scores are not 7 - 2. So we move to the next row (april 3).\n   4. The opponent on april 3 is still the white sox, but this time the score is 2 - 1, which does not match our target. Continue to the next row (april 4).\n   5. The opponent on april 4 is the athletics, and the score is 6 - 3, which also doesn't match our target. Proceed to the next row (april 5).\n   6. The opponent on april 5 is still the athletics, but this time the score is 6 - 1, which does not match our target. Continue to the next row (april 20).\n   7. The opponent on april 20 is the twins, and the score is 2 - 1 (10), which doesn't have a dash (-) between the numbers. So we move to the next row (april 22).\n   8. The opponent on april 22 is the royals, and the score is not 7 - 2. Skip this one and proceed to the next row (april 23).\n   9. On april 23, the game was postponed due to rain, so no score is available. Move on to the next row (april 24).\n  10. On april 24, there were two games against the royals, one with a score of 9 - 6 and another with 2 - 0. Neither match our target score. Continue to the next row (april 25).\n  11. The opponent on april 25 is the yankees, and the score is 6 - 4, which does not match our target. Proceed to the next row (april 26).\n  12. The opponent on april 26 is still the yankees, but this time the score is 4 - 3, which also doesn't match our target. Continue to the next row (april 27).\n  13. The opponent on apr 27 is again the yankees, and the score is 1 - 0, which still does not match our target. Proceed to the next row (april 28).\n  14. On april 28, the opponent is the yankees, but the score is 5 - 2, which again does not match our target. Finally, we reach the last row (april 29).\n  15. The opponent on the last row is the mariners, and the score is 7 - 2, which matches our target. So the match that has a 7 - 2 score was between the mariners and the yankees (row index: 28, column name: 'score').\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Look for rows where the 'score' column equals 7 - 2. Check each row starting from the first and compare the score. If not found, move to the next row until we find a match or reach the end.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [ { \"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": 'score' } ]",
