From the table, we see that she wrote \"Princess Party\" which is at row 39.\n2. Check who directed the episodes in the table. We can see that Michael Spiller directed most of the episodes, but not all of them. So, it's possible that he didn't direct \"Princess Party\".\n3. Cross-check the row where Elaine Ko wrote the episode to find out who directed it. In the same row (row 39), we don't see a director listed. This indicates that the episode was not directed by Michael Spiller.\n\nNow, let's present the answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the episode written by Elaine Ko.\",\n    \"Check who directed the episodes in the table.\",\n    \"Cross-check the row where Elaine Ko wrote the episode to find out who directed it.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 39,\n      \"column_name\": \"directed by\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
