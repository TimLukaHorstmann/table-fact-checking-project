However, I can check related models with similar names such as r6500, r6550, etc.\n2. Check for the \"name\" column to see if there are any models named \"sporter target\". This is not found in the table.\n3. If no model matches the name exactly, then check other models with similar names (e.g., sporter lightweight or ar - 15a2 government) that have the same characteristics as a sporter target (e.g., s - 1 stock, a2 receiver, etc.).\n4. For each row where we find similar names, check the \"fire control\" column to see if it's a1. In this table, only r6500 and r6700 have a2 in the fire control column, while none of the rows with similar names to sporter target have a1.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, my final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the model for sporter target, check for exact match and then similar models, find relevant details for each matching model (stock type, receiver type), compare fire control column\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"fire control\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"fire control\"},\n    ...
