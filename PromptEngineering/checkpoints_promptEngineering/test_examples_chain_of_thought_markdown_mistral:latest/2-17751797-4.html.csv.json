This information is not directly provided in the table, but we can infer it by finding the rows where the away team is \"Bolton Wanderers\".\n2. Since the away team is listed only once (row number 11), we look for a match with a score of 0-1 or 1-0. However, in the given table, there's no such row for Bolton Wanderers.\n3. There are replay matches indicated in the table, where the home and away teams from the original game switch places. If we consider this possibility, then we would look for a match where Bolton Wanderers were the home team and lost 1-0 (since we know they won 1-0 against Manchester United as their only appearance).
