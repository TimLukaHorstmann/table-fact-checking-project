In this table, they appear twice (rows 9 and 7).\n2. Check each attendance value for the Oakland Raiders matches, as those values determine whether or not their match with another team drew the highest attendance. The relevant cells for Oakland's matches are:\n   - Row 7: { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" } (24 games)\n   - Row 9: { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" } (38 games)\n3. Compare the attendance values for these two matches to determine which one had the highest value. In this case, we see that Oakland Raiders' match in row 7 has an attendance of 50015, while their match in row 9 has an attendance of 38463.\n4. Since the attendance for the first match (row 7) is higher than the second one (row 9), we can conclude that the Oakland Raiders' match against another team did draw the highest attendance during the 1968 season.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team that played against Oakland Raiders (rows 7 and 9)\",\n    \"Check each attendance value for the Oakland Raiders matches\",\n    \"Compare the attendance values to determine which match had the highest value\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" }\n  ]\n}",
