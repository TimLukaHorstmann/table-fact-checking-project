Unfortunately, the table does not explicitly provide the teams for each player. However, we can infer that since Rod McCurdy played against India (India is not a domestic Australian team), and the venue is in Launceston which is a city in Tasmania, it is possible that he represents Tasmania. Similarly, we can infer that Josh Marquet and Paul Hutchison represent Queensland as their matches were held within the state of Queensland.\n2. Determine the rank for each player: The table provides win-loss records (wins / total games) for each player. We need to compare these records to determine their ranks. The higher the ratio, the better the record. Based on the provided data, Rod McCurdy's record is 5/15 and Paul Hutchison's record is 5/27.\n3. Compare the rank positions: To check if one player ranks above another, we compare their win-loss ratios. If a player has a higher ratio, they have a better record and thus a higher rank. Comparing Rod McCurdy (5/15) with Paul Hutchison (5/27), it is clear that McCurdy's ratio is higher than Hutchison's, indicating that McCurdy has a better record.\n4.
