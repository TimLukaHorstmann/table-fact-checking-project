For each driver, verify if they completed exactly 60 laps by checking the 'laps' column. To complete exactly 60 laps, a driver should have 60 laps in their respective row.\n3. Count the number of drivers who completed exactly 60 laps. Since the total number of races is 25 and some drivers did not finish the race (indicated by '+' sign in the 'time / retired' column), we may need to exclude them from our count.\n4.
