    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim is that the composition of the amethyst is 99.99% silver with an issue price of 94.95 in the year 2008.\n\n2. Look for rows that match the year specified in the claim (2008) and the artist's name (konrad wachelko). Since there is no specific theme or composition mentioned, we will look at all rows that fit these criteria.\n\n3. In the table, we have only one row that matches the year 2008 and the artist konrad wachelko: \"amethyst crystal\". We can see its composition (99.99% silver) and issue price (not specified).\n\n4. Since there is no other row with the same year and artist, we can consider the 'amethyst crystal' as the only matching coin in 2008 for konrad wachelko.\n\n5. Compare the found composition with the one stated in the claim: The composition of the amethyst crystal (found) is indeed 99.99% silver, which matches the composition given in the claim (to be 99.99% silver).\n\n6. Since we didn't find any issue price for 'amethyst crystal' in the table, it doesn't match the issue price mentioned in the claim (to be 94.95).\n\nFinally:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim's components: year, theme, artist, composition, and issue price\",\n    \"Look for matching rows based on the provided year and artist\",\n    \"Check if the found row's theme (amethyst crystal) matches the one in the claim (amethyst)\",\n    \"Compare the found composition with the one stated in the claim\",\n    \"Check if the found issue price matches the one stated in the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"theme\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"composition\" }\n  ]\n}",

In this table, rows are numbered starting from 1, so the relevant row_index is 3 (since the first two rows don't match the given criteria).\n\n3. Determine the column containing the issue price for each coin. In this case, it's the \"issue price\" column. The relevant columns are constant across all rows, so there's no need to specify a column_name.\n\n4. Compare the value of the cell at row_index 3 and column_name 'issue price'. If the value is greater than 95, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false. In this case, the relevant cells are: [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"}].\n\n5.
