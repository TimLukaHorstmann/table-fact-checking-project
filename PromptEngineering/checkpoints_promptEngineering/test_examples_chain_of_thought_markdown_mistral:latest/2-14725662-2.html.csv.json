    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the game we are looking for from the table. The date or opponent alone does not uniquely identify a game, but the combination of both can be used to find it. In this case, we are searching for the game against Michigan. The dates and opponents don't help narrow down the search, as multiple games in the table are on the same day and against different opponents.\n2. We notice that there is a row with \"opponent\" as \"michigan\". We will check this row to see if it was played at Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis, MN.\n3. In the row where the opponent is Michigan, we can find the \"site\" column. This tells us where the game took place.\n4. The site for the game against Michigan is listed as \"michigan stadium ann arbor , mi\". This does not match our claim that the game took place at Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis, MN. However, it's important to note that the table only includes home games for this team, which are all played at Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis, MN (except for the Michigan game).\n5. Although the game against Michigan did not take place at Memorial Stadium as claimed, it is clear from the table that we can find the home games of this team at Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis, MN.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row corresponding to the game against Michigan.\",\n    \"Check the site column for the row corresponding to the game against Michigan.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"site\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
