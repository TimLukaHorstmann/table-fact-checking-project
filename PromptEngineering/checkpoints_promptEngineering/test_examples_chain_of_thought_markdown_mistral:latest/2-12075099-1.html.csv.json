From the given table, it can be seen that the \"opponent\" column has a value of \"pride\".\n2. Next, I need to determine if the Pride was an away team for the game held on June 18. To do this, I need to find out the location of each team's home stadium from the table and compare it with the location of the game held on June 18 (which is \"alumni stadium (kean university)\").\n3. Based on the information gathered in steps 1 and 2, I can check if the Pride played at a different stadium than their home stadium on June 18 to determine whether they were the away team or not.\n4. Finally, after confirming that the Pride was indeed an away team for the game held on June 18, I need to verify if their result for that game is 'w 11 - 10'. This can be found by matching the row index containing the Pride and the appropriate column name (result) from the table.\n\nWith this reasoning in mind:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find the team's name that corresponds to the 'Pride', Determine if the Pride was an away team for the game held on June 18 by comparing their home stadium with the location of the game held on June 18, Verify if the Pride's result for that game is 'w 11 - 10'\", \"Find the row index containing the Pride and the appropriate column name (result)\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home / away\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Identify the opponent for the game on July 14th from the table. We find it by looking at the date column where the value is 'july 14'. The opponent is not explicitly stated, so we move to step 2.\n\n2. Check if there's another row in the table with the same opponent as July 14 and different field locations. If yes, then the claim would be false since the opponent on that specific day should have been at a different location than bishop kearney field. However, there is no such row in our table.\n\n3. Since there's no other match for the same opponent with a different location on the given date or any other date, it means the opponent for July 14th could be any team that has played at bishop kearney field. Among all opponents listed in the table, only Cannons (on May 29 and July 30) have played at bishop kearney field.\n\n4. Compare the remaining dates when Cannons played at bishop kearney field (May 29 and July 30) with the date on which we're checking the opponent (July 14).
