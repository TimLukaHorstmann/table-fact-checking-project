Observe that in the 7th row (index 6 due to zero-based indexing), we find \"Denni Neufeld\" in the column named \"lead\". Since this table does not have a specific column named \"second\", we should look for \"Denni Neufeld\" in all columns to check if he is listed as a second.\n4. Scroll through each row again but this time pay attention to every cell containing Denni Neufeld's name.\n5. In the 7th row, we find that Denni Neufeld is not present in the \"second\" column. However, he is present in the \"lead\" column for the city named \"winnipeg\". We know that curling teams have a skip (or lead), second, third, and fourth player. So, even though Denni Neufeld is listed as a lead, this means he is still part of the team roster.\n6.
