We can do this by looking for rows where the \"district created\" column is true (in this case, all rows except for New York 1, 12, and 14).\n\n2. Next, we need to check if these newly created districts have an incumbent. To do this, we look at the \"incumbent\" column.

Finally, we compare the number of newly created districts without an incumbent with the total number of newly created districts.
