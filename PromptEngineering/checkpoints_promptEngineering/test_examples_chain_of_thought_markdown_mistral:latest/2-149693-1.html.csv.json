    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the final two competitors from the table. Since the table doesn't provide information about the competition order or ranking, we can only compare points scored.\n2. In the table, there are two entries with a score of 1 point: \"heel de wereld\" by Corry Brokken (row 2) and \"ma petite chatte\" by Fud Leclerc (row 7).\n3. The claim states that these were the final two competitors in the Eurovision 1958 song contest, so we need to verify if they are the entries with the lowest scores.\n4. In the table, we can see that there are other entries with lower points: \"nel blu dipinto di blu\" by Domenico Modugno has 13 points (row 1), \"dors , mon amour\" by Andr\u00e9 Claveau has 27 points (row 3), \"un grand amour\" by Solange Berry and \"lilla stj\u00e4rna\" by Alice Babs have 1 point each (rows 4, 5), but these entries are not the final two according to the claim.\n5. The remaining entries have higher scores than \"heel de wereld\" and \"ma petite chatte\". \"jeg rev et blad ud af min dagbog\" by Raquel Rastenni has 3 points (row 6), \"f\u00fcr zwei groschen musik\" by Margot Hielscher has 5 points (row 8), and \"die ganze welt braucht liebe\" by Liane Augustin has 8 points (row 9).\n6. Since the scores of \"heel de wereld\" and \"ma petite chatte\" are the lowest in the table, it is reasonable to assume that they were among the final two competitors in the Eurovision 1958 song contest.\n7. Finally, we compare this assumption with the claim: The final two competitors scored only 1 point each, which matches our findings from the table.\n\n   Final answer:\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify final two competitors by comparing points scored, since there's no information about competition order or ranking in the table.\", \"Verify if the entries with the lowest scores match the claim's description of the final two competitors.\", \"Compare the assumption with the given claim to determine its validity.\"],\n     \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"}]\n   }",
