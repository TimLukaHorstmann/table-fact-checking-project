The relevant cell is at row index: 0, column name: \"match\".\n2. Since the claim states that Tisha Venturini played 4 matches at Gavle, we need to find rows where both the match and location are Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup Final and Gavle respectively, with a total of 4 such rows.\n3. Check for each row in the table if Tisha Venturini is part of the lineup or a substitute. In this table, only players who start a match are listed in the \"lineup\" column, so we can assume that any player not listed in the lineup did not play in that match.\n4. Examine each row where both the match and location are Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup Final and Gavle, looking for Tisha Venturini in the \"lineup\" column. If we find 4 such rows with Tisha Venturini in the lineup, then our claim is true.\n5. Analyze each row in turn:\n   - Row 1 (the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup final match) contains no information about individual players, so we cannot determine if Tisha Venturini played in this match. This row does not count towards our total of 4 matches.\n   - Rows 1-3 are group stage matches at Gavle, but they do not have Tisha Venturini listed in the lineup, so they also do not contribute to our total of 4 matches.\n   - Row 4 is a quarter-final match at Gavle where Cromwell was substituted on, but there is no information about who started the match or who was on the bench. Therefore, we cannot determine if Tisha Venturini played in this match. This row does not count towards our total of 4 matches.\n   - Row 5 is a semifinal match at Vasteras where no individual players are listed in the lineup, so we cannot determine if Tisha Venturini played in this match.
