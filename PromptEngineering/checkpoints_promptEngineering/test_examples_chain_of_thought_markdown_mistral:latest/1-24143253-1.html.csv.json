To check the validity of this statement, we need to find their marriage year and compare it with the remaining couples in the table.\n3. From the table, we can see that Mona Graham and Karl Malden got married in the same row (row_index: 0) as their names are listed together.\n4. Since they both passed away in 1982 and 1996 respectively, their marriage likely started sometime before 1982.\n5. To find out when they got married, we would need additional information such as the exact year they got married. However, since the claim only states \"at just 71 years\", it implies that their marriage lasted until at least one of them passed away in 1982.\n6. We can see from the table that some couples have longer marriages than Mona Graham and Karl Malden (e.g., James Stewart and Gloria McLean were married for 45 years). Therefore, it's possible that Mona Graham and Karl Malden had a marriage shorter than 71 years, but since their marriage lasted until at least one of them passed away in 1982, the claim can be considered true if we interpret \"at just 71 years\" to mean a maximum length of 71 years.\n\nanswer: TRUE\nrelevant_cells: [{ \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Marriage Years (if known)\" }]",
