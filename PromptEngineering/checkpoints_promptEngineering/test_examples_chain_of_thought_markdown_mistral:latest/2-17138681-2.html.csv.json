    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim statement: The claim states that there be more than 12.42 million viewers for the entry with a rating / share of 3.2 / 8.\n\n2. Locate the relevant rows in the table based on the given condition (rating / share of 3.2 / 8). In this table, only one row fulfills this condition: row_index = 5.\n\n3. Compare the viewer count of the identified row to the claim value. The viewer count for the row with a rating / share of 3.2 / 8 is 12.42 (from column \"viewers (millions)\").\n\n4. Since the viewer count matches the claim value, we need to check if there could be other rows with greater values that are not accounted for in the claim statement. However, since the claim only asks about entries where the rating / share is exactly 3.2 / 8, there can be no other such entries to consider.\n\nIn summary:\n- The viewer count for the row with a rating / share of 3.2 / 8 (row_index = 5) matches the claim value (12.42 million).\n- There are no other rows in the table that meet the specific conditions mentioned in the claim statement.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the relevant row based on the given condition, compared the viewer count with the claim value and found a match. No additional rows were considered because the claim only pertained to entries with a specific rating / share.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"viewers (millions)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"rating / share (18 - 49)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
