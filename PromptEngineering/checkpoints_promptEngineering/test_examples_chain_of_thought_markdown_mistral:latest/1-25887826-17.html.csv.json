The total points scored by Cruz Azul are 153 and those for Guadalajara are 161.\n3. Subtract the number of points scored by Guadalajara from the number of points scored by Cruz Azul: 161 - 153 = 8.\n4. Convert the difference to decimal format: 8 / 10 = 0.8.\n5. Since the claim mentions \"about\", we need to find an approximation within 2 decimal places for the difference in points. In this case, 0.8 rounded to two decimal places is approximately 0.80.\n6.

Determine if Quer\u00e9taro has approximately 10 times less points than Am\u00e9rica: To do this, we need to find a factor of 10 that is close to the ratio between the two teams' points (i.e., 136 / 0 \u2248 x). In this case, since the numerator is non-zero, we can compare the values directly and see that Quer\u00e9taro has approximately zero points compared to Am\u00e9rica's 136 points.
