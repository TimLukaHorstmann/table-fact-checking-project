    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the week where the claim occurs, which is May 8 from the table.\n2. Determine the tier for that week, which is Tier I based on the data provided.\n3. Check the match results in the table for players who play each other and belong to Tier I on May 8. The claim lists two pairs of players: gigi fern\u00e1ndez & natalia zvereva, and conchita mart\u00ednez & patricia tarabini.\n4. Find the rows in the table where both players in a pair are listed as opponents in matches, and the tier is I on May 8. The first row matching this condition is for gigi fern\u00e1ndez & natalia zvereva, with row_index 5 and column name \"winner\" and \"runner - up\" respectively.\n5. Find another row where both players in the second pair (conchita mart\u00ednez & patricia tarabini) are listed as opponents, and the tier is I on May 8. No such row exists in the table. However, it's important to note that there is a row for conchita mart\u00ednez and another player (Patricia Tarabini) with the same match results as those mentioned in the claim, but it doesn't include patricia tarabini as \"runner - up\" since that spot is occupied by martina hingis.\n6. Check if there are any other semi-finalists for these matches. If the players listed as winners and runner-ups have the same semi-finalists mentioned in the claim, it strengthens the claim's validity. The relevant cells for the first match (gigi fern\u00e1ndez & natalia zvereva) include:\n   - row_index: 5, column name: \"semi finalists\": helena sukov\u00e1 mary pierce\n   - row_index: 6, column name: \"semi finalists\": helena sukov\u00e1 mary pierce\n7. Since we don't have enough information to definitively conclude that both conchita mart\u00ednez and patricia tarabini were semi-finalists (as per the claim), the claim is not strictly TRUE, but it can be considered partially true if we assume that patricia tarabini was one of the semi-finalists.\n\nThe final answer will be:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify week and tier, search for relevant matches in the specified week and tier, check opponents, winner/runner - up, and semi-finalists for those matches.\",\n  \"answer\": \"PARTLY TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"winner\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"semi finalists\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The week is on 9th May (there is no exact match but weeks 1st May and 8th May are close), semi-finalists are Helena Sukov\u00e1 and Mary Pierce, runner-up is Conchita Mart\u00ednez Patricia Tarabini, and the winner in question is Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Nat\u00e1lia Zvereva.\n\n2. Check if there is any row in the table where the week matches either 1st May or 8th May (as they are the closest), semi-finalists match Helena Sukov\u00e1 and Mary Pierce, runner-up matches Conchita Mart\u00ednez Patricia Tarabini, but winner doesn't match Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Nat\u00e1lia Zvereva.\n\n3. If no such row is found, then the claim is TRUE since the matching conditions of week, semi-finalists, and runner-up are satisfied with the corresponding rows, and the winner is also correct for those rows but we need to find the specific match.\n\nNow, let's check the table:\n\n- On week 1st May, there's no direct match in tier ii for Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Nat\u00e1lia Zvereva as the winner, but it matches with Conchita Mart\u00ednez instead.\n- On week 8th May, there's no direct match in any tier (i, ii, or iv) for Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Nat\u00e1lia Zvereva as the winner, but it matches with Arantxa S\u00e1nchez Vicario instead.\n\nSince there's no exact match where all conditions are satisfied, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells:\n[\n  { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winner\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"winner\" }\n]",

    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Identify the table's structure: It consists of five columns (week of, tier, winner, runner-up, semi finalists) and rows representing matches in different weeks and tiers.\n2. Determine the relevant week: The claim mentions \"22 may\", but it appears that the provided table has no direct match for this date as it only lists the days of the month (e.g., 1 may, 8 may, etc.). This makes it difficult to directly verify the claim using the given data.\n3. Examine possible connections: Since the table seems to be ordered chronologically, one could try to identify if \"22 may\" falls within a span of two weeks covered by the table (e.g., 15 may to 29 may covers 2 weeks). If so, we might find relevant information in those rows.\n4. Analyze the connected rows: In the given table, there are no rows that explicitly match \"22 may\". However, there is a range of rows from 22 May to 29 May (2 weeks), as mentioned in the claim.\n5. Find the corresponding matches: In these two weeks, we can find results for different tiers and players (tier iii and tier iii, respectively). There are no matches labeled as \"winner\" for \"22 may\", but there is a potential connection as one of the semi-finalists in the tier iii match on 22 May is sandrine testud.\n6. Determine the answer: Since we cannot directly confirm if 22 May was the winner for any specific match, our conclusion should be that we cannot definitively say whether the claim is true or false using this data alone.\n\n   Final answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify table structure\",\n    \"Determine relevant week\",\n    \"Examine possible connections\",\n    \"Analyze connected rows\",\n    \"Find the corresponding matches\",\n    \"Determine the answer\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"semi finalists\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
