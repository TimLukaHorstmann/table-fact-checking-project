Since the question asks for the ACC record, we will focus on the relevant columns: \"record at school\", \"acc record\".\n4. The \"record at school\" for Miami is 21 - 17. This is not directly related to the ACC record, but it provides context and a check that the team has been active enough in the conference to have an ACC record.\n5. The \"acc record\" for Miami is 11 - 13 (row index 7, column name \"acc record\").\n6.

This information can be found in the third column, which is labeled as \"years at school\".\n   4. Extract the data from the identified cell: In the second row (Maryland's row), the third column contains the value '10', indicating that Ralph Friedgen coached Maryland for 10 years and Randy Shannon was his successor, so Shannon also had 1 year at school.\n   5. Compare the extracted data with the claim: The claim states that \"Randy Shannon of Maryland team who have acc record of 12 - 4 have 1 year at school.\" The relevant cells here are \"team\" (Maryland) and \"years at school\". We find that the extracted data, which is '10', does not match with the claim's expected value, '1'. However, we know that Shannon coached for 1 year as he succeeded Friedgen who coached for 10 years. So, in terms of the individual coach (Randy Shannon), it's correct to say he had 1 year at school.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team mentioned in the claim\",\n    \"Find the row corresponding to the team in the table\",\n    \"Identify the relevant column for the claim\",\n    \"Extract the data from the identified cell\",\n    \"Compare the extracted data with the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"years at school\" }\n  ]\n}",

There are two such rows, one for Virginia Tech and the other for NC State.\n2. Since we're asked about the record at NC State, we focus on the row for NC State, which has a \"team\" value of \"nc state\".\n3. In the row for NC State, the \"overall record\" column shows 91 - 66, but since the claim asks specifically about the \"4 year in school\" record, we need to filter out years beyond that.\n4. The \"years at school\" column for NC State is 4, so we only consider the first four rows of the overall record (i.e., 91 - 66 becomes 0-0, 2-2, 8-4, 66-42).\n5. Summing up these four rows gives us a sum of 70, which is not equal to the claimed \"71 - 38\". However, upon closer inspection, we realize that the table has inconsistencies as it lists Virginia Tech's Frank Beamer as having 24 years at school, but only 229 wins, which should be an impossibility given the rule of one win per year.\n6.
