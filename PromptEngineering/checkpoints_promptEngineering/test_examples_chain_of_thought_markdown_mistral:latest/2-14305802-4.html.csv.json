The game number or ID is not provided, but we can assume it is one of the games in the table because the table lists all games played during a specific season.\n\n2. To find the Philadelphia Flyers' matches, we need to look for their opponent and compare the score to determine if they lost. Since no team's name is \"Philadelphia Flyers\", we cannot directly identify them from this table. However, we can cross-reference the games where the opponents won by 2 or more goals, as a two-goal loss indicates a defeat for that team.\n\n3. In this table, there are only three instances where an opponent won by at least 2 goals: rows 22 (LA Kings - 4 to 2), 26 (Chicago Blackhawks - 4 to 2), and 28 (Boston Bruins - 6 to 4).\n\n4. Analyze the game records for these three teams. The LA Kings have a record of 15 wins, 4 losses, and 3 ties, which corresponds to the score in row 22 where they won by 2 goals against an opponent who cannot be the Philadelphia Flyers (since their name is not mentioned).\n\n5.
