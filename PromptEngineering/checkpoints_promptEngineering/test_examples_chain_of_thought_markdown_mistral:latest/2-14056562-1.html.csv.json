The relevant cells for this would be all the rows where the event column is 'marathon'.\n2. In the table, there are four rows with the event type as 'marathon', but only one of them (row 3) has the position column filled. This means that out of the four 'marathon' events, only one occurred in a position where the position was recorded.\n3. Since no row has the year column equal to 2000 and the event type is 'marathon', we can conclude that the 'marathon' did not take place in the year 2000.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check which rows have the event type as 'marathon'.\",\n    \"Identify that there are four such rows, but only one has a filled position column.\",\n    \"Recognize that since no row has the year column equal to 2000 and the event type is 'marathon', the marathon did not take place in the year 2000.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"event\" }\n  ]\n}",

Find the row that corresponds to the third position in the table (position column).\n   - Since the positions are sorted in ascending order, we start from the lowest number and move upwards.\n   - The first row has a position value of 11th, which is not the third position, so we move to the next row.\n   - The second row has no position listed (represented by '-'), so we move to the next row.\n   - Finally, the third row has a position value of 3rd, and it matches our search criteria.\n\n3. Once we have found the relevant row, check if there is a finishing time mentioned in that row under the \"event\" column (marathon times are given for some but not all positions).\n   - In this case, the third row also has an event value of marathon and a corresponding finishing time of 2:12:53.\n\n4. Based on our analysis, we find that the third position does have a finishing time of 2:12:53.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim and relevant table columns\", \"Find the row corresponding to the third position\", \"Check if there's a finishing time in that row\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"notes\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
