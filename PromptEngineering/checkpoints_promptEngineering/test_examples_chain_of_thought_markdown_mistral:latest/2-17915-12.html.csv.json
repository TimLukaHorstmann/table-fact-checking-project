We find Lleyton Hewitt in rows with opponent indices [1, 5]. The year in row 1 is 2002 and the outcome is runner-up (not winner), so we can eliminate this row. In row 5, the year is 2003 and the outcome is runner-up as well, so we cannot use this row for now.\n2. There are no rows where Lleyton Hewitt is a winner with years 2002 or 2003.\n3.

In this table, there are 7 rows for Ilya Hewit's Master Series finals.\n\n2. Determine whether or not each match in these finals had a score that ends with \"4 points\". To do so, we need to analyze the score column and check if any of the scores end with a difference of 4 points (either in games or sets).\n\n3. Analyze the scores for each match:\n    - In row 1, the score is `6 - 7 (6 - 8) , 6 - 3 , 7 - 6 (7 - 5) , 6 - 7 (2 - 7) , 2 - 6`. This score does not end with a difference of 4 points.\n    - In row 3, the score is `5 - 7 , 6 - 7 (5 - 7)`. This score ends with a difference of 2 points in sets, so it does not meet the requirement.\n    - In row 5, the score is `2 - 6 , 4 - 6 , 4 - 6`. This score does not end with a difference of 4 points.\n\n4. Now we have checked 3 out of the 7 matches, and none of them meet the requirement. We need to check the remaining 4 matches to see if there are any exceptions.\n\n5. Analyze the scores for the remaining matches:\n    - In row 2, the score is `6 - 1 , 6 - 2`. This score does not end with a difference of 4 points.\n    - In row 4, the score is `6 - 7 (4 - 7) , 0 - 6 , 4 - 6`. This score does not end with a difference of 4 points.\n    - In row 6, the score is from a match that Ilya Hewitt won and we do not have information about the opponent's score. Since it is a winning match for Ilya, if it ended with a difference of 4 points, it would still meet the requirement even though we don't know the exact score. However, since we cannot confirm or deny that it meets the requirement without additional information, we will exclude this match from our analysis.\n\n6.
