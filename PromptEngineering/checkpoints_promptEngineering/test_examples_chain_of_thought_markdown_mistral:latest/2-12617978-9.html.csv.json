If any of the companies asked for exactly 200,000 pounds, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nNow, let's check the table:\n\n1. The companies in the table are: beach break live, Goldgenie (formerly Midas Touch), youdoodoll, gaming alerts, Concentrate Design, reestore, cush'n 'shade, hungryhousecouk, steri spray, Caribbean ready meals, fit fur life, jpm eco logistics, electroexpo, chocbox, red button design.\n2. The companies that asked for 200,000 pounds are gaming alerts and reestore (from episode 2) and caribbean ready meals (from episode 6).\n3.

For each entrepreneur in episode 7, find the amount of money requested from the corresponding column \"money requested\". The amounts for jerry mantalvanos & paul merker are 100000 in row index 10 and sammy french is also 100000 in row index 11.\n3. Compare the amounts requested by both entrepreneurs in episode 7. The amount requested by jerry mantalvanos & paul merker (100000) is not the highest among themselves since sammy french also requested 100000. However, if we compare their request with other episodes' entrepreneurs, it is indeed the highest for episode 7.\n\nIn summary, the claim is partially true as jerry mantalvanos & paul merker did not request the highest amount within episode 7 but they did request the highest amount in episode 7 compared to other episodes.\n\nThe final answer can be represented in a JSON object as follows:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify all rows related to episode 7\",\n    \"For each entrepreneur, find the 'money requested' amount\",\n    \"Compare the amounts requested by both entrepreneurs in episode 7\",\n    \"Compare their request with other episodes' entrepreneurs\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"money requested\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"money requested\" }\n  ]\n}",
