Next, find out the country of the player identified in step 1. In our table, the country of Charles Howell III is \"united states\".\n3. Compare the country found in step 2 with the claim made in the original question. The claim is that the home country of the 8th rank player is the United States.\n4. Since the country of the 8th rank player (Charles Howell III) found in step 2 matches with the claim, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nOutput:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the rank of the player we are interested in (the 8th rank).

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the row corresponding to the player whose reset points we are checking (in this case, vijay singh). The row index is 2, so the row number is 2.\n\n2. Check the column corresponding to \"reset points\". The column name is \"points\" in the given table.\n\n3. Compare the value at the intersection of the identified row and column from step 1 and 2. In this case, the value is 99000.\n\n4. Cross-check if there's any other information that might affect our conclusion. The claim does not mention any specific number of events related to vijay singh; however, in the table, we can see that vijay singh has 23 events.\n\n5. Since we found the exact value (99000) and the event count (23) mentioned in the claim, there's no reason to suspect any discrepancy.\n\nNow, let me provide the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify player for whom we are checking reset points\",\n    \"Find the row corresponding to the player (row index)\",\n    \"Check the 'points' column value at the identified row\",\n    \"Cross-check if there is any event count specific to the player in the claim\",\n    \"Compare the found value with the claimed number, taking into account the mentioned event count\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
