The 'result' value for the identified row is 'loss'.\n3. Since the game on September 27th resulted in a loss, we need to check if this loss affected the overall record of the team. In our table, the 'record' column shows that before this loss the record was 2 - 0. After the loss, the record becomes 2 - 1 (with two wins and one loss).\n4. Compare the expected record after the loss with the actual record from the table. The expected record is 2 - 1, and the actual record in the table is also 2 - 1.\n5.
