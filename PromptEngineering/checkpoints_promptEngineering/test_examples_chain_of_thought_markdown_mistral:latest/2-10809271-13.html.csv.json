Locate relevant data for Carlton and Prince Park from the table. To do this, look for rows where the \"home team\" is \"carlton\" and the \"venue\" contains \"prince park\".\n3. Verify if any such row exists in the table. In this case, there is a row with the home team as Carlton and venue as Prince Park.\n4. Determine the truth value of the claim based on the verification. Since we found a match, the claim is true.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Locate relevant data for Carlton and Prince Park from the table\", \"Verify if any such row exists in the table\", \"Determine the truth value of the claim based on the verification\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}]\n}",
