In this case, there's only one row that matches the specified year (the second row).\n2. Next, I look at the column named \"result\" in the identified row since that column will indicate whether the movie won or was nominated.\n3. The value in the \"result\" column for the 1999 row is \"won\". However, to check if it was nominated first, we need to find out if there's any other award related to the same category and film from that year.\n4. Since no other awards are listed for the 1999 favorite movie, I look at the nomination status of the other categories associated with the same movie in the table (e.g., favorite voice from an animated movie).\n5. For the same film (the rugrats movie) and year (1999), there is no award listed under \"favorite voice from an animated movie\", so it could not have been nominated for that category.\n6. At this point, since the movie did not win in any other relevant categories on the table, it follows that it was not previously nominated in the 1999 favorite movie category either.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the row where year matches 1999\", \"Check the 'result' column for the identified row\", \"Look for other awards related to the same movie and year\", \"If no award found, check if the movie was nominated in any relevant categories on the table\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\" }\n  ]\n}",
