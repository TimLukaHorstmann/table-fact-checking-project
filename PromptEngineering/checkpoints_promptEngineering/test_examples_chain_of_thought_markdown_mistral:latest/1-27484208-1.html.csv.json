Compare the world ranks provided in the table for each university in 2013, according to three different ranking systems (ARWU, QS, and WUR).\n2. For the University of Western Australia (UWA), its best rank in 2013 was in the ARWU with a rank of 91st. Its worst rank was in the WUR with a rank of 168th.\n3. For Durham University, its best rank in 2013 was also in the ARWU with a rank of 201 - 300th. Its worst rank was in the QS with a rank of 90th.\n4. Comparing the ranks, it can be observed that UWA's best rank (ARWU) is higher than Durham University's best rank. However, its worst rank (WUR) is also worse than Durham's worst rank (QS).\n5. To determine whether UWA \"do better\" overall, we should consider both the best and worst ranks. A university with a smaller gap between its best and worst ranks may be considered to have done better overall.\n6. In this case, the difference in the ranks for UWA (91st - 168th = 77) is larger than the difference for Durham University (201st - 90th = 111).\n7. Based on the information provided and comparing the best and worst ranks, it appears that Durham University has a smaller gap between its best and worst ranks in 2013 than UWA, suggesting that overall, Durham University did better in 2013 according to these rankings.\n\nNow let's output the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Compare world ranks for each university in 2013.\",\n    \"Find best and worst ranks for both universities.\",\n    \"Determine if the best rank of UWA is higher than Durham's best rank.\",\n    \"Determine if the worst rank of UWA is worse than Durham's worst rank.\",\n    \"Consider the gap between best and worst ranks to determine overall performance.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\" }\n  ]\n}",

For WUR: Dartmouth is ranked 126th while University of T\u00fcbingen is ranked 201 - 225th. Since 126 is lower than any value in the range 201 - 225, it means Dartmouth College ranks higher than University of T\u00fcbingen according to WUR.\n\n3. For ARWU: Dartmouth is ranked 151 - 200th while University of T\u00fcbingen is ranked 151 - 200th. Since the ranges overlap, it means they have the same ranking according to ARWU, but Dartmouth has a higher minimum value (151) compared to T\u00fcbingen's minimum (151), so Dartmouth still ranks higher.\n\n4. For QS: Dartmouth is ranked 113th while University of T\u00fcbingen is ranked 144th. It means that Dartmouth College ranks higher than University of T\u00fcbingen according to QS.\n\n5.

Identify the university mentioned in the claim: In this case, it's the \"University of T\u00fcbingen\" from Germany.\n2. Find the row associated with the identified university: This corresponds to the 6th row in the table (index starts at 0).\n3. Examine each world rank for the identified university across different ranking systems in 2013:\n   - World Rank by WUR (column named \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"): The rank is between 201 and 225, which means it's within the given range.\n   - World Rank by ARWU (column named \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"): The rank is also within the range of 151 to 200.\n   - World Rank by QS (column named \"world rank by qs , 2013\"): The rank is between 144 and 144, which means it's at the lower bound of the given range.\n\nSince the university of T\u00fcbingen does not have the worst rank in every single ranking according to the provided table, the claim is FALSE.\n\n   Here's the JSON output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the university mentioned in the claim\",\n    \"Find the row associated with the identified university\",\n    \"Examine each world rank for the identified university across different ranking systems\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n  ]\n}",
