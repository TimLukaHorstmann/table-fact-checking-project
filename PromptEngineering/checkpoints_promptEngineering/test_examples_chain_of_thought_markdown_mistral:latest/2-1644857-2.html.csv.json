    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Check the table for the country named 'Scotland'. The row index of Scotland is 2.\n2. In the 'stolen ends' column for Scotland, check the value. For Scotland (row 2), the value under the 'stolen ends' column is 10.\n3. Compare this value with 9 to determine if it is less than or equal to 9. The value of 10 is greater than 9.\n4. Check for the skip for Scotland. In the first column (country) for row 2, the value is 'david murdoch'. We do not need to compare this with any specific condition as we are looking for a skip named 'craig brown', which does not exist in our table.\n5. Since Scotland has more than 9 stolen ends and 'craig brown' is not a skip in the table, the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Check the table for the country named 'Scotland', compare its stolen ends with 9, check if 'craig brown' is the skip for Scotland\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"stolen ends\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"skip\"}]\n}",
