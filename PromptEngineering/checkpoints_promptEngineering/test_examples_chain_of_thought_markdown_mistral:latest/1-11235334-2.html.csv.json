Find relevant data in the table: We will look for the row containing the information about chapter six, which has an unnamed column value of 6.\n\n3. Check if the air date matches the claim: The air date for chapter six is listed as tbc (to be confirmed), so we do not have a definite answer yet.

Check if there are any conflicting information: In this case, there is no conflicting information found in the table.\n\n5. Final decision: Since the claim states that chapter six \"be air\" on October 27, 2008, but the actual air date for chapter six is not confirmed (tbc), we cannot definitively answer whether the claim is true or false.
