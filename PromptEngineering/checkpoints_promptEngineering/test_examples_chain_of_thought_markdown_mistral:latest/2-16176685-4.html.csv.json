For SI, we look at row 3 of the table since the rank is 3, and the column name is \"points\". The value is 234.\n\n4. Compare the scores: OS (259) > SI (234). This means that ondrej starosta scored more points than serge ibaka.\n\n5. Since we have found a difference in points, it directly affects their ranking. The player with more points ranks higher. In this case, ondrej starosta has more points, so he should naturally rank higher than serge ibaka.\n\n6. To confirm the ranking in the table, look at the \"rank\" column for both players. Ondrej starosta is ranked 4 and serge ibaka is ranked 3. This is inconsistent with our observation that ondrej should rank higher because of the difference in points scored.\n\n7.
