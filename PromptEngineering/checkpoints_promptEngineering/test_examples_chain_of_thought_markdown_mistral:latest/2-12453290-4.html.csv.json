Next, we look for the row in the table corresponding to that date. In this case, it's the 9th row with the opponent as \"cardinals\".\n3. Then, we check the score and loss columns for this row. The score, according to the claim, is 3 - 2 (10). This matches with the value in the table (5 - 3 becomes 3 after subtracting the number of runs for the Cubs, which is 2). The loss, as per the claim, should be (2 - 1) for player Eldred. In the table, we can find that the loss for this game is attributed to player Eldred with a value of 0, implying no loss in this particular game. However, the table doesn't show losses on a per-player basis. The total number of losses for the Cubs as a team at this point is 4.\n\nSince the claim only involves the score and not the player's loss, we can say that the score part of the claim matches with what's in the table.
