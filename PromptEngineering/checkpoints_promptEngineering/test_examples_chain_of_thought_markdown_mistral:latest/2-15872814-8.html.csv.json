First, locate the row in the table that corresponds to the game where Rafter Alston had high assists according to the claim (\"Atlanta\" with a score of \"w109 - 101 (ot)\"). In this case, we are looking for row number 75.\n2. Check the cell under the \"high assists\" column in that row. According to the table, Rafter Alston had 8 high assists during the game in Atlanta.\n3. Compare the result found with the claim. The claim states that \"Rafter Alston have 8 high assists\". Our comparison shows that the claim is correct as the number of high assists by Rafter Alston during the game in Atlanta was indeed 8.\n\nNow, let's provide our final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the row corresponding to the game mentioned in the claim.\",\n    \"Check the 'high assists' cell in that row.\",\n    \"Compare the number found with the number stated in the claim.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 75,\n      \"column_name\": \"high assists\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n   1. Identify the row that corresponds to the date mentioned in the claim, which is April 8. In our table, row index 5 represents April 8.\n   2. Check the values of columns \"game\" and \"score\" for this row (row 5). If the value under the \"game\" column is 'w 109 - 101 (ot)' and the value in the \"date\" column is indeed 'april 8', then our claim is true.\n   3. As we can see, the value for \"game\" in row 5 is 'w 109 - 101 (ot)', and the value for \"date\" is also 'april 8'. So, the score on April 8 was indeed 'w 109 - 101 (ot)'.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the row that corresponds to the date in the claim.

    "resp": "1. Identify the date for which we are checking if there is a game with a higher score than the one specified (W 109 - 101 (OT)). The given date is not present in the table, so we need to find dates later than April 18.\n\n2. Find the next game after April 18 by looking through the table chronologically from row 73 onwards (since row 72 has a date earlier than April 18). The first game that we encounter with a date later than April 18 is in row 81, which corresponds to April 19.\n\n3. Obtain the score for the game corresponding to April 19 by looking at the \"score\" column of row 81. This will tell us whether the score on April 18 (W 109 - 101 (OT)) was higher or lower than the score in the subsequent game.\n\n4. Analyze the score for the game on April 19 to determine if it is greater than the score on April 18. In this case, the score for the game on April 19 is 127 - 109 (OT), which is higher than W 109 - 101 (OT).\n\n5.
