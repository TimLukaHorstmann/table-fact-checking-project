In that row, check the 'game' column to confirm that it matches the game we are interested in, i.e., the game number 56. The game number is represented as the second value in the first cell of the row. Since it is 56, this confirms that the row corresponds to the correct game.\n3. In the same row, check the 'score' column to find the score for this game. The score is given in two parts: the team score (104 in this case) and the opponent's score (99 in this case), separated by a space followed by the result type (overtime in this case).\n4. Compare the obtained score (104 - 99) with the claim score (99 - 105 overtime). Since they do not match, we know that the scores are different.
