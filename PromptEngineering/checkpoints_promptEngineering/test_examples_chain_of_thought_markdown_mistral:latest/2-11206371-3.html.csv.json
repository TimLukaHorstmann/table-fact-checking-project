Next, check the column corresponding to each episode (column C) for the name of the episode to confirm if it matches \"blood is thicker then water\".\n3. Similarly, for red squirrels, we will find the episodes where they appeared (row 16), and then check the column corresponding to each episode to confirm if any of them match \"a hero's welcome\".\n4.
