Search for relevant rows: From the given table, we find two rows with 'airline' in the 'company' column: `klm asia` and `transaviacom`. But neither of these companies is incorporated in France or have a parent/group company from France. The only other row that includes 'airline' is `transaviacom france`, which is an associate of `transaviacom`, but it's not the principal activity. We don't find any rows where 'principal activities' and 'incorporated in' match the claim.\n4.

    "resp": "Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the meaning of the claim: The claim states that a subsidiary has an incorporation in Netherlands, principal activities of airline, and it belongs to Transaviacom.\n\n2. We then examine each row of the table to find a company that matches all three criteria:\n   - The type column should have \"subsidiary\".\n   - The incorporated in column should have \"Netherlands\".\n   - The principal activities column should have \"airline\".\n   - The group's equity shareholding column should have some relationship with Transaviacom (e.g., 100% owned by Transaviacom or has a lower percentage but is still part of the group).\n\n3. After examining each row, we find that 'transaviacom', 'high speed alliance' and 'klm asia' are subsidiaries incorporated in Netherlands, but their principal activities do not include airline. 'klm cityhopper uk' is a subsidiary incorporated in United Kingdom, so it does not match the condition of being incorporated in Netherlands.\n\n4. We finally find that 'kenya airways' is associated (not wholly-owned) and doesn't have Netherland incorporation or principal activities as an airline. So, it does not match the criteria either.\n\n5. The last company to examine is 'schiphol logistics park', but it is a joint controlled entity, not a subsidiary.\n\n6.
