In this case, it corresponds to row 10 (november 5, 1978 against chicago bears).\n2. Next, we check the result column of that specific row. If the value is '31 - 29', then the claim is true. However, in our table, the result for this game is 'w 31 - 29' which means Seattle Seahawks won by a score of 31-29.\n3. Since the value in our table does not match with the claim, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere is the final JSON object:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find the row where game site is soldier field\", \"Check if result matches the claim\", \"If yes, claim is true, else claim is false\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"}]",

    "resp": "Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the game played at Soldier Field based on the 'game site' column. In this table, we see one match played at \"soldier field\" (row 10).\n2. Find the week number when this game was played. The first row of the table shows us that week 10 was on November 5, 1978.\n3. Check if there's another game after week 10 with the same opponent (Chicago Bears) as the one played at Soldier Field. Scanning through the rows, we see that no other match is against the Chicago Bears after week 10.\n4. Since there are no matches against the Chicago Bears after week 10 and the game played at Soldier Field was won by the Seahawks (as indicated by 'w' in the result column), it implies that the result of the game played at Soldier Field was indeed w 31 - 29.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the game played at Soldier Field, find week number of this game, check if there's another game against same opponent after week 10, and compare the result with the one in the table.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"game site\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\" }\n  ]\n}",
