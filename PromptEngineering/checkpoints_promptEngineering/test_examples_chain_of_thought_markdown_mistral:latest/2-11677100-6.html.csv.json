Compare the claim with the data provided in the table: To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to find out who was picked first in the 2000 MLB draft and compare it with Adrian Gonzalez's row in the table.\n3. Extract relevant information from the table: In the table, there are 9 rows of players, each with their name, position, school, hometown, and the team that picked them in the 2000 MLB draft. To find out who was picked first, we need to look at the \"pick\" column (since it is not explicitly stated, we will infer it based on the row order).\n4. Analyze the extracted data: From step 3, we see that Adrian Gonzalez's row (row index 8) is the first row where the player's position and school are both \"infielder\" and \"eastlake high school,\" respectively. This indicates that he was picked before any other players in the table.\n5.
