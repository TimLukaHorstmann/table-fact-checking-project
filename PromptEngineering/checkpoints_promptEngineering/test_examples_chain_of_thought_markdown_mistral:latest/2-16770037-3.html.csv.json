To do this, we subtract the try difference from the expected value.\n\nIn our case: -4 (expected) - 20 (actual try diff) = -24\n\n4. Since -24 is not equal to 0 (the value that would indicate the claim is true), we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Search for a team where points against is 213, find Dinamo - Bucure\u0219ti in row 3.\\n2. Look up try difference of the found team in the 'try diff' column, which is 20 (in row 3).\\n3. Compare the calculated value (-4 - 20 = -24) with the expected value (0) and see that they are not equal.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [ {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points against\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"try diff\"} ]\n}",
