The relevant row is the one with \"samba / young hearts run free\" in the dance/song column, and \"dixon\" in the judge column.\n\n2. Check the total score for that row. In the given table, the total score for the row where dance/song is \"samba / young hearts run free\" is 38.\n\n3. Compare this total score with other rows to find out the placement. The row \"samba / young hearts run free\" has a total of 38 and there are two rows with the same total (12th row and 8th row). We need to check the other judges' scores for these two rows to determine the final placement.\n\n4. Check the relevant cells for the other judges' scores in the 12th and 8th rows. The relevant cells are:\n    - Row_index: 8, Column_name: horwood, goodman, tonioli: (9, 9, 10)\n    - Row_index: 12, Column_name: horwood, goodman, tonioli: (9, 8, 9)\n\n5. Sum the scores for each row to get the total for all judges. The sums are 36 and 34 respectively. Since the total score for the row \"samba / young hearts run free\" is higher (38), it comes in a higher position (second place).\n\n6. Check if Dixon gave a score of 10 to this song.

Check for any row in the table that matches 'samba / young hearts run free'. The relevant cell is row_index = 8.\n3. In the total column, we can see that the score for 'samba / young hearts run free' is 38. This indicates that Goodman indeed gave a score of 9 (since it sums up to 38 with three judges giving 9 each).\n4. To check if the dance was in second place, we need to compare the total scores across all dances. In this table, the total score for 'showdance / i like the way (you move)' is also 34. So, both dances have the same total score, and therefore they are tied for second place.\n5. Since Goodman gave a score of 9 to 'samba / young hearts run free' (which we verified in step 3) and it was tied for second place (as verified in step 4), the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim, verify Goodman's score, check if the dance was in second place\", \"Verify Goodman's score for samba / young hearts run free by checking the total score (38 = 9*4)\", \"Check if the dance was in second place by comparing total scores with other dances (tied for second place with showdance / i like the way (you move))\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total\"}, {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"total\"}]\n}",
