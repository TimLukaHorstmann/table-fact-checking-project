Determine their positions in those years. Looking at the table, we can see that Brooks Robinson was a third baseman in 1972, while Pete Rose was a third baseman in 1976 as well (though he switched to shortstop later in his career).\n\n3. Check if any other players won the award in those years. To do this, we would need additional information about which award is being referred to, such as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award or a Gold Glove award for defensive excellence. However, the table does not provide that information, so it's impossible to definitively determine if any other players won the award in 1972 and 1976.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to confirm if anyone else won the award in those years, we cannot say for sure whether the claim is true or false.

However, without specific confirmation about this assumption, we can't be completely certain.\n2. Check each row of the table for any clues related to the award. There are several pitchers in the table, but no column mentioning awards. This suggests that the data in the table does not include award information.\n3. Compare the number of unique pitchers to the maximum number of times an individual could have won the award (assuming 45 years of baseball history from 1971 to 2015). Since there are 28 unique pitchers in the table, and each player can theoretically win the award every year they pitched, we would expect to see at least one player with ten awards. However, since the data lacks award information, it's impossible to know if any player actually won ten awards.\n4.

If there are four consecutive years, it indicates that an outfielder won the award for 4 times consecutively.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relevant cells:\n\n|   year | player          | team                  | league   | position          |\n|-------:|:----------------|:----------------------|:---------|:------------------|\n|   1996 | kirby puckett   | minnesota twins       | american | outfielder        |\n|   1997 | eric davis      | baltimore orioles     | american | outfielder        |\n|   1998 | sammy sosa      | chicago cubs          | national | outfielder        |\n|   1999 | tony gwynn      | san diego padres      | national | outfielder        |\n\nWe see that there are four consecutive years with an outfielder, but it's not clear whether the same outfielder won the award in all those years.
