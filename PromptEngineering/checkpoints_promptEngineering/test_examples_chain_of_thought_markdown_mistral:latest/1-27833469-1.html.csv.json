From the table, we can see that the title \"sex , losers , and videotape\" is in row 110.\n   - Determine the season number for this episode. Since the title is listed under column 'title' and not under a specific season column (season numbers are given only up to 8 for the other episodes), we cannot find the exact season number directly from the table.

To check if a series belongs to a specific season, I will look for the 'season' column in the table.\n3. If we look at the first row which represents Series 93 (and the horse he rode in on), it is from Season 1 as indicated by the 'season' value '1'.\n4. Similarly, going through the entire table and checking the 'series' and 'season' columns, I find that series 101 belongs to row 101 with a 'season' value of '11'.\n5.

Therefore, to find episode number 12, we need to find the row where the series number is 12 or greater but less than 13.\n4.
