In this case, we are looking for episodes written by Erica Montolfo - Bura.\n2. Find the episodes in the table which match our condition (written by Erica Montolfo - Bura).

Identify the number of viewers for each episode from the 'us viewers (million)' column. For Erica Montolfo - Bura's episodes, we see that she wrote:\n   - Episode 2 with 1.81 million viewers (row index 1)\n   - Episode 8 with 1.92 million viewers (row index 8)\n   - Episode 17 with 2.21 million viewers (row index 17)\n4. Compare the episode written by Erica Montolfo - Bura with the highest number of viewers (1.81 million for episode 2). Since episode 2 has the required number of viewers, it is relevant to our claim.\n5. Confirm that the claim matches with the data found in the table. The claim states \"Erica Montolfo - bura write an episode which gain 1.81 million viewer\".

The column \"no in season\" for these rows are 9, 11, and 14 respectively.\n3. We then look for episodes written by Kenny Smith before row 110 (season 11). To do this, we simply compare the \"no in season\" values for all episodes written by Kenny Smith with numbers less than 11. In our case, only row 109 has a \"no in season\" value less than 11.\n4.
