    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, identify the column names for pick in each round and overall to compare their values with Edgerrin James.\n2. Second, find the row containing Edgerrin James by matching his name in the table (row 1).\n3. Third, check the \"pick\" column in the first round (row 1) to see if it matches 4, as per the claim.\n4. Fourth, check the \"overall\" column for row 1 to see if it matches 4.\n5. Finally, compare the values found from steps 3 and 4 with the claim statement.\n\nThe answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find the 'pick' in the first round, Find the 'overall' for Edgerrin James, Compare the values found with the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"overall\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
