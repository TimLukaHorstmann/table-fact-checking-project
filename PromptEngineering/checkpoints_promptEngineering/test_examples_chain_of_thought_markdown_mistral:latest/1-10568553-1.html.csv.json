In this table, we see that Route 123 intersects in both Plymouth and Rockland counties.\n2. From the given claim, we are looking for a location in Plymouth county where Route 123 intersects.\n3. Since the table only lists one road (hanover street) in Plymouth county that has no specific milepost, it does not provide information about which roads intersect at this point. However, there is another row for the same location (Rockland) where Route 123 is mentioned explicitly.\n4. Since we cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim using the given table, let's examine the context a bit more: The streets listed in the table are typically major roads or highways, and it seems unlikely that there would only be minor intersections for the specified locations without any mention of them in the table.\n5. In real-world road networks, it is not uncommon for roads to have multiple names or be known by different names in different municipalities. For example, Route 123 might continue as Hanover Street when it enters Plymouth county from Rockland.\n6. Given these considerations, the claim that \"hanover in plymouth county intersects route 123\" can tentatively be considered TRUE, but with some uncertainty due to the lack of specific information about the intersection points within Plymouth county.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the counties where Route 123 intersects.\", \"Find locations in Plymouth county where Route 123 intersects.\", \"Examine the context and real-world road networks for possible connections.\", \"Consider the possibility of different names for the same road in different municipalities.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"county\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"roads intersected\" }\n  ]\n}",
