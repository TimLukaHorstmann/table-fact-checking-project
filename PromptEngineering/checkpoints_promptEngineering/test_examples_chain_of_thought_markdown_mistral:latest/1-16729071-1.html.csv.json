Traverse through the table row by row starting from the top, until we reach the row that corresponds to the identified week number.\n3. In the current row (row_index=16), check the column names for \"attendance\". If found, extract its value (column_value).\n4. If the attendance value matches the one mentioned in the claim (60038), then the answer is TRUE. Otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nAfter following these steps, the output can be presented as follows:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify week number from the claim (15)\", \"Traverse through the table row by row to find the corresponding week\", \"Check if the attendance column exists and its value matches the one mentioned in the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "1. Identify the date of the game mentioned in the claim: The claim states that the game took place on November 4th.\n\n2. Find the row in the table corresponding to that date: In this table, each row represents a week, and the first column indicates the week number. We look for the row where the 'date' column equals 'november 4'. Since there is no exact match, we can infer that the game may be from any week whose date falls on November 4th.\n\n3. Compare the result of each game on November 4 with the claimed result: For each game on November 4, compare its 'result' value against the claimed result of \"w 10 - 3\". There are two games on November 4 in this table: rows 10 and 15.\n\n4. Check if any of the compared results match the claimed result: If any of the compared results equal the claimed result, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false. In this case, we can see that row 10 has a 'result' value of \"w 10 - 3\", which matches the claimed result.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the date mentioned in the claim: november 4.
