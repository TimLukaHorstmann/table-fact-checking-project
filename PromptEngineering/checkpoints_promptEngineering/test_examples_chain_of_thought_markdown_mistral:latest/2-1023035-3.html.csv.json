Check when Coveny started his career (first cell in the 'career' column) and find out the year when he had his first cap (first cell in the 'first cap' column). This tells us that he started his career in 1992 and played his first cap on 7th June 1992.\n3. Check when Coveny's most recent cap was (last cell in the 'most recent cap' column), which is 4th June 2006.\n4. Calculate the number of caps Vaughan Coveny played during his career by subtracting the year of his first cap from the year of his last cap. This will give us a total of 15 years.\n5. As there are 365 days in a year (ignoring leap years for simplicity), the number of caps in one year is approximately 365/15 = 24.33 caps per year on average. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a cap, we round this down to 24 caps per year.\n6. Since Coveny played his career for 15 years, he would have had 15 * 24 = 360 caps if the number of caps per year was constant. But as we can see from the table, Coveny's number of caps per year varied during his career.\n7. To check whether Vaughan Coveny played a cap during his second and third years of the team, we need to look at the difference between consecutive rows in the 'caps' column for the row corresponding to Coveny. The difference is 64 (Coveny's caps) - 0 (initial value before Coveny's row) = 64. This means that there are no caps recorded between Coveny's first and second year, indicating he did not play during his second year. Similarly, the difference between consecutive rows for the next two rows is 58 (the number of caps for Steve Sumner) - 64 (Coveny's caps) = -6, which again indicates no caps were recorded between Coveny's third and fourth years, indicating he did not play during his third year.\n8. Summarizing the findings from the previous steps, we can see that Vaughan Coveny indeed had a cap during his first year (1992), but did not have a cap during his second or third year of the team.
