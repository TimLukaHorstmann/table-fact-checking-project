    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the criteria for the claim: The claim states that the match was played on a clay surface and had a score of 4 - 6, 6 - 4, 3 - 6.\n\n2. Scan through the table to find rows matching the given score (4 - 6, 6 - 4, 3 - 6). There are no such rows in the table.\n\n3. Since there's no row that matches the specified score in the table, we can't verify whether the match was on a clay surface.
