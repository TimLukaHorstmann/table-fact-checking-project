Determine the requested information: The claim asks whether 2.3 million people in Africa saw the episode titled \"rabid\". Since there is no direct information about the episode's international viewers or any African viewers specifically, we need to determine if there is a reasonable way to infer this information based on the available data.\n\n3. Find relevant episodes: To do that, find the row in the table corresponding to the episode titled \"rabid\". In this case, it would be row 173 (since episode numbers start at 1 and end at 200, so 175-194 correspond to 173-192).\n\n4.

Unfortunately, none of the available columns provide this kind of information.\n\n5.
