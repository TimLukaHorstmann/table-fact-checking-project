Since both players have the same score, we need to check other columns such as 'to par' and 'money' to see if there are any differences between them that could affect their ranking in the tournament.\n4. Compare the 'to par' column values for Raymond Floyd (-4) and John Huston (-4). Both players have the same number of strokes over par, so they are still tied.\n5. Check the 'money' column values for Raymond Floyd ($38000) and John Huston ($38000). Both players have the same amount of money prize, so they are still tied.\n6.

So, based on the place value alone, John Daly appears higher than Bob Gilder.\n3. However, since the table does not explicitly show the places of players tied for positions lower than 1st, it's possible that Bob Gilder might be tied with other players for a position lower than 1st, which would mean he is ranked higher than John Daly according to their scores (if their scores are lower than John Daly's).\n4. To determine this, we need to compare the scores of Bob Gilder and John Daly. In the table, we can see that Bob Gilder has a total score of 283, while John Daly's total score is 276.\n5. Comparing their scores shows that John Daly has a lower score than Bob Gilder, which means that based on the scores, John Daly should rank higher than Bob Gilder.\n\nGiven this reasoning process, the claim \"bob gilder place higher than john daly\" is FALSE.\n\nRelevant Cells:\n- { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n- { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\" }",
