    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the team we are looking for, which is \"la salle\".\n2. Find all the rows where the team column matches the given one (\"la salle\"). In this case, there are 3 such rows (30, 31, and 35).\n3. Check the value in the record column for each of these rows. The record is composed of wins and losses. The number before the dash represents the wins, while the number after represents the losses.\n4. Inspect the values for the rows with \"la salle\": (24 - 6), (25 - 6), (26 - 7). This indicates that la salle has 24+25+26 = 75 wins and 6+6+7 = 19 losses.\n5. The total number of games for \"la salle\" is the sum of their wins and losses, which is 75 + 19 = 94 games played.\n6. To determine if they have 4 wins and only 1 loss, we need to find a combination of their wins and losses that equal 4 and 1 respectively.\n7. From the total number of wins (75) and losses (19), it is not possible to achieve exactly 4 wins and 1 loss without playing less than all their games. However, if we consider only the games listed in the table, we can see that they have won 3 out of the 4 games listed, with one loss.\n8. Since the claim refers specifically to the number of games listed in the table, and not their overall record, the claim is true for these games, but false if considering all their games played.\n\nNow, here's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the team we are looking for (la salle).\",\n                      \"Find all rows where the team matches la salle.\",\n                      \"Check the record column to find their wins and losses.\",\n                      \"Calculate their total games played by adding wins and losses.\",\n                      \"Determine if they have 4 wins and 1 loss.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
