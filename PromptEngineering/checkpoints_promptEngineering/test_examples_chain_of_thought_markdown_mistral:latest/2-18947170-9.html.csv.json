There are 3 such rows: mount Elgon, mount Moroto, and mount Kadam.\n2. Check if the highest prominence for these peaks is greater than or equal to 2458 (the value given in the table for mount Elgon). To do this, we will compare each peak's prominence with the value of 2458 and keep a running total if they meet the condition.\n3. For mount Elgon, the prominence is 2458, which meets the condition. However, since we are only counting peaks that meet or exceed this value, mount Elgon will not be considered further in this step.\n4. Move on to mount Moroto: its prominence is 1818, which does not meet the condition of being greater than or equal to 2458.\n5. Lastly, mount Kadam has a prominence of 1690, which also does not meet the condition of being greater than or equal to 2458.\n6. Since we found no peaks in Uganda with a prominence greater than or equal to 2458, we can conclude that there are less than or equal to 3 such peaks in Uganda.\n7. Now let's verify if there are more than 3 peaks in Uganda: since we found only 3 peaks (mount Elgon, mount Moroto, and mount Kadam) that do not meet the condition of having a prominence greater than or equal to 2458, the total number of peaks in Uganda cannot exceed 3.\n8. Lastly, we check if there are more than 3 peaks with a prominence greater than 2458.
