    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the tower we are looking for in the table by its drop height, which is 272 feet (or 272 inches as per the given units). No tower in the table matches this description exactly. However, we need to convert all drop heights to the same unit for comparison.\n\n2. Convert the drop height values to a common unit, such as centimeters (since the given units are feet and inches, we will convert both to centimeters). We can find 1 foot equals 30.48 cm, and 1 inch equals 2.54 cm. Using these conversions, we get:\n   - Canada's Wonderland drop height = 200 feet * 30.48 cm/foot + 20 inches * 2.54 cm/inch = 6096 cm\n   - Carowinds drop height = 100 feet * 30.48 cm/foot + 0 inches * 2.54 cm/inch = 3048 cm\n   - California's Great America drop height = 207 feet * 30.48 cm/foot + 0 inches * 2.54 cm/inch = 6291.88 cm\n   - Kings Dominion drop height (gyro drop) = 272 feet * 30.48 cm/foot + 0 inches * 2.54 cm/inch = 8351.36 cm\n   - Kings Island drop height (gyro drop) = 264 feet * 30.48 cm/foot + 0 inches * 2.54 cm/inch = 7995.52 cm\n\n3. Check if any tower's drop height matches the target value of 8351.36 cm after conversion. Only Kings Dominion's gyro drop has a converted drop height that matches this value.\n\n4. Now, find out when Kings Dominion opened the gyro drop by checking the \"opened\" column in the table. In this case, it opened on March 22, 2003.\n\nFinal answer: {\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the tower with a drop height of 272 feet\",\n    \"Convert all drop heights to centimeters for comparison\",\n    \"Find the row that matches the converted target drop height\",\n    \"Check the 'opened' column for the found row\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"drop height\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opened\" }\n  ]\n}",
