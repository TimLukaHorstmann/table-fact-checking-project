In this case, there's only one row with a 'starts' value of 4, which is in year 2000.\n\n2. Next, check the 'poles' column for the same row (year 2000). The 'poles' value for that row is 0.\n\n3. Therefore, when there is a start of 4 and a position of 46, the pole being 0 is correct according to the given data.\n\nOutput:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows where starts column value is 4\",\n    \"Check the poles column for the same row\",\n    \"Compare the found pole value with the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"starts\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"poles\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to analyze the claim:\n\n1. First, we need to find the number of poles for any team in the table, since the claim mentions one pole. In this case, there is only one row with \"poles\" equal to 1, which is at row index 20 (year 2004).\n\n2. Next, we need to find the number of starts for the same team at row 20 and if it equals 4. However, since there are no rows with a \"year\" value of 2004 in our table, this implies that there are no records available for that year. Therefore, we cannot verify the claim with the provided data.\n\n3. Since we cannot check whether the number of starts is 4 for the team having one pole, our final answer is indeterminate. We cannot say if the claim is true or false because we lack sufficient information to evaluate it.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the row index of a team with 1 pole.\",\n    \"Check if there exists another row for the same team (row_index) where starts equals 4.\",\n    \"Since there are no rows with the specified 'year' value, we cannot verify the claim.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"Indeterminate\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"poles\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"starts\" }\n  ]\n}",
