This can be done by finding all rows where the date falls within this range (1998-12-04 to 2009-12-31). There are 7 fights in total.\n\n2. Count the number of times Manny Pacquiao did not have any defenses during these fights. From the table, it seems that there are no rows indicating that he had defenses.\n\n3. Calculate the percentage by dividing the number of fights without defenses (obtained in step 2) by the total number of fights (obtained in step 1). In this case, it would be 7 fights without defenses / 7 fights = 100%, which is equal to 50% when expressed as a percentage.\n\n4.

Since it's followed by \"6 / 12\", it means Pacquiao was victorious in this bout.\n\n4. Confirm if it's the first TKO: Since we don't have any other rows with a TKO result and date prior to 2001, it can be concluded that the fight on June 23rd, 2001, was indeed Pacquiao's first TKO in a winning bout.\n\nFinally, here's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Find the row corresponding to 2001\", \"Check if the result is TKO and a win\", \"Confirm if it's the first TKO\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

For each opponent, check the 'result' column to find out whether the fight went the full 12 rounds or not. If it did, compare the scorecards to determine if there was a larger difference in any other bout.\n3. In this case, we notice that the fight with Ricky Hatton (row_index: 6) is a knockout in round 2, meaning there were no scorecards as it wasn't a full 12-round fight. We compare this to other fights where Pacquiao went the distance.\n4. From rows 1, 3, 5, and 7, we find that these bouts were decided by decisions (technical knockout or split decision). We compare the scorecards for these bouts against each other to see if there was a larger difference in final scoring points.\n5. Analyzing the scores for the fights with Marco Antonio Barrera (row_index: 4) and Juan Manuel Marquez (rows 5 and 6), we find that the fight against Juan Manuel Marquez resulted in a split decision, but there's no mention of the exact points. Therefore, we cannot compare these scores directly.\n6. Compare the points from the Barrera bout (tko 11 / 12) with the points from the Ledwaba bout (tko 6 / 12). Since this is a technical knockout and not a split decision, we can assume that Pacquiao won by a unanimous decision. The table does not provide exact scores, so we cannot compare them numerically.\n7. We see that there are no other full-round decisions listed in the table.

First, we need to identify the weight categories Manny Pacquiao fought in during the specified time period (1998 - 2009).\n2. We can observe the table and see that he started with the Flyweight category (112) on December 4th, 1998.\n3. Next, we move down the rows to find when he stopped fighting in this weight category. However, there's no row showing a change of weight class after the first row.\n4. Since we can't find a clear indication that Pacquiao switched to a different weight class during the specified time period, we can assume that he remained within the same weight category throughout these years.\n5. To verify this assumption, we check the last entry in our table which shows a fight on May 2nd, 2009 (Junior Welterweight - 140). Since we can't find any row indicating a change of weight class after this date, we can conclude that Pacquiao continued to fight within the same weight category.\n6. Finally, since the claim asks whether Pacquiao fought in the same weight category from 1998 to 2009, and our investigation indicates he didn't change his weight class during this time, we can determine that the claim is true.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, we checked the weight categories Pacquiao fought in during the specified time period (1998 - 2009).

    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the claim. It states that Manny Pacquiao had the biggest difference in score points during his bout with Marco Antonio Barrera.\n\n2. To determine this, we need to find the score differences between each of Pacquiao's fights and compare them. A larger difference indicates a bigger win by points. The score differences can be calculated by subtracting the opponent's rounds from Pacquiao's rounds. For example, in the first row, Pacquiao was knocked out in round 8 while his opponent lasted 12 rounds, so the difference is 4 rounds (Pacquiao's rounds - opponent's rounds = 8 - 12 = -4).\n\n3. We find the score differences for each fight:\n   - Pacquiao vs Chatchai Sasakul: Difference = Pacquiao's rounds - opponent's rounds = 8 - 0 = 8\n   - Pacquiao vs Lehlohonolo Ledwaba: Difference = Pacquiao's rounds - opponent's rounds = 6 - 6 = 0\n   - Pacquiao vs Marco Antonio Barrera: Difference = Pacquiao's rounds - opponent's rounds = 11 - 12 = -1\n   - Pacquiao vs Juan Manuel Marquez (1st fight): Difference = Pacquiao's rounds - opponent's rounds = 12 - 12 = 0\n   - Pacquiao vs David Diaz: Difference = Pacquiao's rounds - opponent's rounds = 9 - 3 = 6\n   - Pacquiao vs Ricky Hatton: Difference = Pacquiao's rounds - opponent's rounds = 2 - 12 = -10\n\n4. We compare the score differences to find the fight with the largest positive difference, as that would indicate a bigger win by points. In this case, the fight with the largest positive difference is Pacquiao vs Chatchai Sasakul (8 rounds).\n\n5. Lastly, we compare this difference with the one from the bout with Marco Antonio Barrera (-1 round), which is smaller. Since the difference for the fight with Barrera is smaller than that of the fight with Chatchai Sasakul, it means that Manny Pacquiao did not have the biggest difference in score points during his bout with Marco Antonio Barrera.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Understand the claim\",\n    \"Find the score differences for each fight\",\n    \"Compare the score differences to find the largest positive difference (indicating a bigger win by points)\",\n    \"Compare this difference with the one from the bout with Marco Antonio Barrera\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\" }\n  ]\n}",
