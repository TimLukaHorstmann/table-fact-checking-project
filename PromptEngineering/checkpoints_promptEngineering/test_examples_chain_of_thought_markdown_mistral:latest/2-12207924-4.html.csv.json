There are no other teams mentioned in this table that could possibly be the Blue Jays.\n4. Verify Jefferson's losses: To verify if Jefferson had any losses, we need to find rows where Jefferson is listed as the \"loss\" column and his team (the Mariners) plays against a different opponent. Looking at the table, there are several instances where Jefferson is listed as the \"loss,\" but the opponents are not the Blue Jays.\n5.
