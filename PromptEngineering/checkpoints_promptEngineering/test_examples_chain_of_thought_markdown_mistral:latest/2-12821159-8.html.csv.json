    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that \"rick huiskamp be a runner - up, finish up with a single-digit margin of victory\".\n2. Find the relevant row for rick huiskamp: To find this, we look at the 'runner - up' column and identify the row where the name is 'rick huiskamp'. This is the 3rd row in the table.\n3. Check if rick huiskamp is indeed a runner-up: The second column lists the tournament results, and we can see that in the 3rd row (the relevant row), rick huiskamp's name appears as the runner-up.\n4. Check the margin of victory for rick huiskamp: We look at the 'margin of victory' column for the same row (row 3). The value there is 10 strokes, which is not a single digit.\n5. Combine the results from steps 3 and 4: Since rick huiskamp was indeed a runner-up but did not finish with a single-digit margin of victory, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere is the output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim: 'rick huiskamp be a runner - up, finish up with a single-digit margin of victory'\",\n    \"Find the relevant row for rick huiskamp: Check the 'runner - up' column and find the 3rd row\",\n    \"Check if rick huiskamp is indeed a runner-up: Yes, he is listed as a runner-up in the 3rd row\",\n    \"Check the margin of victory for rick huiskamp: The value in the 'margin of victory' column (10 strokes) is not a single digit\",\n    \"Combine the results from steps 3 and 4: Since rick huiskamp was indeed a runner-up but did not finish with a single-digit margin of victory, the claim is FALSE\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"runner - up\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
