No direct information about the falcon shield's owner is provided, so we need to examine other columns for a connection.\n2. Notice that the knights who have no cart (e.g., wally and zeke) also do not have a shield animal listed, suggesting a possible correlation between having a cart and having a shield animal. However, this does not definitively prove it, as other knights like gallop and brick do have both a cart and a shield animal.\n3. Since we don't have enough information to establish a definitive connection between the cart and shield animal, let's focus on the knight with the falcon as their shield animal: wally.\n4. Wally's external weapon is not mentioned directly in the table, but we do know that his main weapons are daggers. In cases where a knight has multiple weapons listed (e.g., phil), only one of those is assumed to be the external weapon, as each knight can only wield one external weapon at a time.\n5. Examining other rows with known external weapons, we see that none of them are two shortswords.\n6.
