    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the peak we are looking for based on the claim. The claim mentions \"barurumea ridge\", but there seems to be no column named \"ridge\" in the table, so let's look for a peak whose name matches \"barurumea\".\n2. Searching the table, I found that the 23rd row corresponds to \"mount sarawaget\", which is located on \"new guinea\", and its elevation (m) is 4121, prominence (m) is 1701, col (m) is 2420, and there's no specific column named 'ridge'.\n3. Since the claim doesn't mention any other columns, we only need to check if there's a \"col\" with the value of 340. In this table, the \"col\" value for mount sarawaget is 2420.\n4. Comparing the claim's column value (340) with the actual value from the table (2420), we see that they are not equal.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the final answer can be represented as:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the peak in question.

    "resp": "Here is the reasoning step-by-step:\n   1. Identify the peak (mountain) whose prominence needs to be verified, which is \"bewani mountains high point\". However, the table does not specify the exact row number for this peak as it only mentions the country and island but not the mountain name. So, we need to search for peaks in the 'country' and 'island' columns that match our given data (in this case, Papua New Guinea and new guinea).\n   2. Compare each row in the table one by one where 'country' equals \"Papua New Guinea\" and 'island' equals \"new guinea\". We will check if any of these rows match the given peak name or have a prominence of 316 m (as per claim).\n   3. Once we find a row that matches our given data, compare the prominence value in that row with the value given in the claim (316 m). If they are equal, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n   4. To find relevant cells: If step 2 results in finding a matching row, that row's index will be our relevant cell(s). In this case, if we found a match for \"bewani mountains high point\" with a prominence of 316 m, then the relevant cell would be the row where 'country' equals \"Papua New Guinea\", 'island' equals \"new guinea\", and either 'peak' or 'prominence' columns have the value of our interest (e.g., 'peak' = \"bewani mountains high point\" or 'prominence' = 316).\n\n   Here is the final answer:\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\n       \"Find the peak whose prominence needs to be verified (bewani mountains high point)\",\n       \"Search for peaks in Papua New Guinea and new guinea\",\n       \"Compare each row where 'country' equals Papua New Guinea and 'island' equals new guinea\",\n       \"If a match is found, compare the prominence value with the claim's prominence (316 m)\",\n       \"If they are equal, the claim is true; otherwise, it is false\"\n     ],\n     \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": []\n   }",
