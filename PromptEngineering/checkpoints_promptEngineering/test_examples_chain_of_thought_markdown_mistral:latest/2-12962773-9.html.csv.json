From the table, we can see that Jan - Hendrik Jagla was born in 1981 and Dirk Nowitzki was born in 1978.\n2. Calculate the difference between the years of birth of these two players. In this case, the difference is (1978 - 1981) = -3 years. However, we know that a negative difference doesn't make sense in this context, so we'll take the absolute value: |-3| = 3.\n3. Compare this calculated difference with the claim that there is an 11 year differential between the youngest and oldest player.

First, we will check each player's height to see if they are taller than 2 meters (since the claim states that guards should be shorter than 2 meters). We note down these players in our mind or a temporary list as \"possible guards\".\n\n2. After identifying possible guards, we will then verify if their position is indeed 'guard'. If not, they would disprove the claim since the claim also states that everyone shorter than 2 meters should be a guard. We note down these players as \"disproof\" or contradictory evidence.\n\n3. Finally, we check if all remaining players (non-possible guards) are indeed guards, to verify the second part of the claim: everyone shorter than 2 meters be a guard. If not, this would disprove the claim.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to the given table and check each player:\n\n1. Identify possible guards (shorter than 2 meters): robert garrett (1.92m), stephen arigbabu (2.05m), steffen hamann (1.93m), demond greene (1.85m), pascal roller (1.85m)\n\n2. Check if possible guards are guards: mithat demirel is not a guard, which contradicts the claim. So, this disproves the claim. It's unnecessary to verify the second part of the claim since we have found a contradiction already.\n\nRelevant Cells:\n- { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"height\" } - mithat demirel height (1.8m)\n- { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\" } - mithat demirel position (guard)\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, we check each player's height to see if they are taller than 2 meters.
