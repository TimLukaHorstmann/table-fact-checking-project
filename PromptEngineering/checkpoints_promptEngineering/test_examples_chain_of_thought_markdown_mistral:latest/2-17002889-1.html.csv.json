Scan the table for rows containing the model name: In our table, we can see that there is a row labeled as \"18sq\".\n3. Check the 'crew' column in the identified row to see if it specifies the number of crew members. If there is only one crew member, it may suggest daggerboards, but with multiple crew members, skegs are more likely. In our table, the 'crew' value for \"18sq\" is not specified.\n4. As we don't have enough information from the table to definitively confirm or deny the claim, we cannot give a conclusive answer based on this table alone. However, considering that most boats with only one crew member in our table are daggerboards and boats with multiple crew members tend to be skegs, the lack of a specified crew value may slightly lean towards the possibility of skegs for \"18sq\".\n\nSince we don't have enough information from the provided table, it is not possible to give a definitive TRUE or FALSE answer.
