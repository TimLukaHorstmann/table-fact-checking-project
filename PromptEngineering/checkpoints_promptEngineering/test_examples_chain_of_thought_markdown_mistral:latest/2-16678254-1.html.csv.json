    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n   1. Verify the table's format: The table is properly formatted, with columns for week, date, opponent, result, record.\n   2. Identify the claim details: The claim states that \"week 8 on november 13 , 1949 have a w result with a score of 65 - 20\".\n   3. Locate the relevant row in the table: In the table, week numbers are listed as integers, and we know that week 8 corresponds to row index 8 (since counting starts from 1).\n   4. Check the result column for the relevant row: The result column for row 8 indicates \"w\", which means a win.\n   5. Check the score for the relevant row: The score is listed as 65 - 20 in row 8, which matches the claimed score.\n\nBased on this reasoning, here's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Verify table format\",\n    \"Identify claim details\",\n    \"Locate relevant row in the table (week 8)\",\n    \"Check the result column for the relevant row (w means win)\",\n    \"Check the score for the relevant row (65 - 20)\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
