    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine the validity of the claim:\n\n1. Identify the team names mentioned in the claim (\"penguins\" and \"blues\").\n2. Locate the rows in the table where the 'visitor' column matches either of the identified team names.\n3. Check if there is a match for both teams in a single row, as that would be the game referred to in the claim.\n4. Extract the data (attendance value) from the cell corresponding to the matched row (if it exists).\n5. Compare the extracted data with the attendance value given in the claim (\"9092\").\n\nThe relevant cells for this problem are:\n- { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"visitor\" }\n- { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" }\n\nAfter searching through the table according to the steps mentioned above, we find that the penguins and blues match in row 1, and their attendance value is given as 9092.\n\nHence, the final answer can be represented as:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the teams in the claim (penguins, blues), find rows where visitor matches either team\", \"Check if there's a match for both in a single row\", \"Extract attendance value from the matching row\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}]\n}",
