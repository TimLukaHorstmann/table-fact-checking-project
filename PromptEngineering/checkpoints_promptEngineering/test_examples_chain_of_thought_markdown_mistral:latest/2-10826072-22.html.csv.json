Check the crowd size for this home game. The relevant cell is in row 3 and column \"crowd\".\n3. Compare the obtained crowd size with a small number to determine if it's small or not. In this case, the crowd size for Essendon's home game is 12865. Comparing this number against a reasonable small crowd estimate (e.g., less than 10,000), we can say that 12865 is larger than our chosen small crowd threshold.\n4. Based on the comparison in step 3, conclude that the home game of Essendon did not have a small crowd.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the row for Essendon's home game\", \"Check the crowd size for this home game\", \"Compare the obtained crowd size with a small number to determine if it's small or not\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}]\n}",
