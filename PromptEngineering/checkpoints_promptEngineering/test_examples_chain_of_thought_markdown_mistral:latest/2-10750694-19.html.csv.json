In the first row of the table, North Melbourne scored 12.10 (82) while Hawthorn scored 8.11 (59), which means North Melbourne beat Hawthorn.\n2. The crowd size for the match between Hawthorn and North Melbourne is 6000 (found in the fourth column of the first row).\n3. Compare this with other matches, looking for a smaller crowd size: In the second row, Footscray had a crowd of 20723, in the third row Collingwood had 18753, in the fourth row St Kilda had 9000, and in the fifth row Richmond had 28000. Finally, Geelong had 49107 spectators (last row).\n\nComparing the crowd size of the match between Hawthorn and North Melbourne with other matches, we find that it is indeed smaller than all the others, which means the claim \"north melbourne beat hawthorn in front of the smallest crowd of the day\" is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Compare home team and away teams mentioned in the claim to determine winner\",\n    \"Find out the crowd sizes for each match, especially for the match involving Hawthorn and North Melbourne\",\n    \"Compare the crowd size for the match between Hawthorn and North Melbourne with other crowd sizes\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" }\n  ]\n}",

We will iterate through each row in the table and find the team with the highest score.\n3. For each team, we will compare their scores with Richmond's score. If a team has a higher score than Richmond, it means Richmond is not the highest scorer of the day. If no teams have a higher score, then Richmond must be the highest scorer of the day.\n4. We start from the first row (hawthorn) and compare its score with Richmond's score (8.11 vs 15.11). Since Richmond has a higher score, we move on to the next team (footscray). Comparing their scores (13.13 vs 15.11), Richmond still has a higher score.\n5. We continue this process for all teams in the table (collingwood, st kilda, and geelong) but find no team with a higher score than Richmond.\n6.
