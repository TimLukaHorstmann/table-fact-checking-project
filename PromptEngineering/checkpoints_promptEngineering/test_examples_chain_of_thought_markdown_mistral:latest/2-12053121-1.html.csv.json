Check if any of these ships entered service after 2003. The column for \"entered service\" gives us the year each ship was put into service. In this case, the year for `ms moby corse` is 2010, which is indeed later than 2003.\n3. Check if the knot value for any of these ships is less than 27. The column for \"knots\" gives us the speed of each ship in knots. In this case, the knot value for `ms moby corse` is 21, which is less than 27.\n4. Since all conditions are met (year built = 1978, entered service after 2003, and knot < 27), it means that there is at least one ship built in 1978 that meets the claim's criteria.\n\nNow, let me present the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify ships built in 1978\",\n    \"Check if they entered service after 2003\",\n    \"Check if their knot value is less than 27\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"built\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"entered service\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"knots\" }\n  ]\n}",

Check the entered service column for the row corresponding to 'ms moby corse'.\n5. Find the value in the entered service column for the row 'ms moby corse'.
