Identify the round where the Philadelphia Flyers made their only pick: From the table, we see that there's one entry for each round from 1 to 7, but not for rounds 2, 3 and 4. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the Philadelphia Flyers made their only pick in round 5 (row 5).\n\n2. Find all players selected in round 5: There are three players listed in row 6 and one in row 5 of the table. We need to determine if any of these four players could be the goaltender and American select from the 2002 draft that the Flyers picked.\n\n3. Determine the position of each player: All players are labeled with their positions, which can help us narrow down our candidates quickly. In this case, only one player (Dov Grumet - Morris) is a goaltender. The other three players in round 5 are defensemen.\n\n4. Check nationality and college for the goaltender: Since we found one potential candidate (Dov Grumet - Morris), it's essential to confirm if he was an American select and if he fits the criteria of being the only American in round 5. From the table, we see that Dov Grumet - Morris is from the United States.\n\n5. Cross-check with the other information provided: Finally, let's ensure there aren't any other players who meet these criteria but were selected in a different round or by a different team.
