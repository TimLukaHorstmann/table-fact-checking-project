In this case, it's Milwaukee Bucks as they are the only team with multiple entries in the table where Brandon Jennings has more than 0 assists.\n\n2. Check if there are at least 8 games in the table for Milwaukee Bucks. Since there are 15 rows and Brandon Jennings plays for the Bucks in 11 of them, we can see that there are enough games to verify the claim.\n\n3. For each game that Brandon Jennings played for the Bucks, find the number of assists he made. We will compare this value with the assists of other players in those same games to determine if Brandon had the highest number of assists in at least 8 games.\n\n4. Review the table row by row and compare the number of assists for each game that Brandon Jennings played for Milwaukee Bucks against the total assists in that game:\n   - Row 1, 12, 13, 15, and 16: Brandon Jennings had more assists than any other player in those games.\n   - Rows 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14: Brandon Jennings had the same number of assists as another player (Jennings and John Salmons both had 6 assists in rows 10 and 11). However, since we are looking for the highest number of assists and not just the leader, these still count towards our total.\n   - Row 8: Brandon Jennings had more assists than any other player except Earl Boykins (who also had 6 assists), but this game does not contribute to the claim since it is not a Milwaukee Bucks game.\n   - Row 13: Drew Gooden had 3 assists, which is less than Brandon Jennings' 4 assists, so this game contributes towards our total.\n\n5. Sum up the number of games where Brandon Jennings had more or equal assists than other players to verify if it's at least 8: 1 + 2 + 1 (since he tied with another player in rows 10 and 11) + 1 (row 13) = 5 + 1 = 6 games.\n\n6.
