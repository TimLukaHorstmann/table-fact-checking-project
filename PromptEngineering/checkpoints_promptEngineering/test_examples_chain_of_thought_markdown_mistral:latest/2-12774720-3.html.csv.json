Examining the table, I can see that Michael Kohlman played in Wimbledon in 1999 (1R), 2002 (2R), 2004 (1R), and 2010 (1R).

    "resp": "Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. First, I need to identify Michael Kohlmann's results across different years in the table. The column names represent the tournament years, and the rows are the tournaments themselves. Since we don't know which player \"Michael Kohlmann\" is, I can't directly look for his specific row. However, if we assume that the player's win-loss record doesn't change across different years for a given tournament, we can look for the rows with consistent 4 losses to find possible candidates.\n\n2. In the table, only one row (grand slam tournaments) has 4 losses in each year: \"1999\", \"2002\", \"2004\". Therefore, we have identified potential rows that Michael Kohlmann may be associated with.\n\n3. Now, I need to verify if there are any rows with a win-loss record of \"4 - 4\" across different years in the table. The win-loss record is shown in the last column for each row.\n\n4. We find that the \"grand slam tournaments\" row has a win-loss record of \"4 - 4\" in both \"1999\" and \"2004\". However, the win-loss record in \"2002\" is not specified in the table (only the number of rounds advanced is given), so we cannot definitively say that it's \"4 - 4\".\n\n5. Since the question asks about Michael Kohlmann's highest win-loss score, and we only have two confirmed instances of \"4 - 4\" for the grand slam tournaments in \"1999\" and \"2004\", there is no higher win-loss score to consider if it exists for other years.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify potential rows with consistent 4 losses, Find rows with a win-loss record of '4 - 4', Compare across different years\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"win - loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"1999\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2004\"}\n  ]\n}",
