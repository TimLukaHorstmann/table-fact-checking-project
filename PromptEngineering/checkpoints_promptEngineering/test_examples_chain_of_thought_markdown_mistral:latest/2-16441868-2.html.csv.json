Next, we need to find out the years associated with these entries. One of them has a year 1974, one has no year specified (but we can assume it's not 1974 as that entry already exists), and one is in 2001.\n3. Now, let us consider the labels for each entry. The entries without specific years have different labels, while the 2001 entry has 'sony' as its label. So we can conclude that the 2001 entry should have a different catalog number than the others to confirm it is the correct one.\n4. Finally, we look for the catalog numbers for each of the '1958 miles' entries. The 2001 entry has 'srcd - 98004' as its catalog number.\n\nanswer: TRUE\nrelevant_cells:\n[\n  { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"label\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"catalog\" }\n]",
