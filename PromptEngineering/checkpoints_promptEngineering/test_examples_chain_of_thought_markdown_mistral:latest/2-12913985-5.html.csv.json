There are 6 such players: Billy Kratzert, Ben Crenshaw, David Edwards, Greg Norman (though he is technically from Australia but he played under the US PGA Tour), Bernhard Langer (who was born and raised in Germany but later became a U.S. citizen), Gary Koch, Mark McCumber, Corey Pavin, and Bob Tway.\n2. Determine their scores after two rounds (to par). For Billy Kratzert, it is 140; for Ben Crenshaw, David Edwards, Greg Norman, Bernhard Langer, Gary Koch, Mark McCumber, and Corey Pavin, it is 142; and for Bob Tway, it is 143.\n3. Compare their scores to determine the top finisher from the United States. To do this, we arrange them in ascending order of their scores: Billy Kratzert (140), Ben Crenshaw, David Edwards, Greg Norman, Bernhard Langer, Gary Koch, Mark McCumber, Corey Pavin, and Bob Tway.\n4.

From the table, we can see that the score for Tsuneyuki Nakajima is 139 (row 3) and for Gary Koch is 143 (row 8).\n   2. To determine how many shots ahead Nakajima is from Koch, we subtract their scores. This gives us: 139 - 143 = -4. In other words, Koch has a higher score by 4 strokes.\n   3. Finally, to answer the claim, we compare the difference in score between Nakajima and Koch with the number of spots ahead specified in the claim (5). Since the difference in score is not greater than or equal to 5, it means that Tsuneyuki Nakajima did not finish 5 spots ahead of Gary Koch.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Compare scores of Tsuneyuki Nakajima and Gary Koch, subtract to find difference in score, compare the difference with the number of spots specified in the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]\n}",

Next, I look for the rows where the score is a single round (in other words, a score without any '+' symbol). This means I ignore the total scores like 139, 140, 142, etc., and focus on individual round scores like 68, 70, 71, 72, 73, 67, 69, and 74.\n3. After identifying the individual round scores, I compare them to find out who has the lowest score, as the claim is about finding the best single round with a lower score being better.\n4.

    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the players whose names match the ones given in the claim: David Edwards and Corey Pavin.\n2. Next, for each player identified in step 1, we look up their respective row numbers (indexes) in the table. For David Edwards, this is row 5; for Corey Pavin, this is row 10.\n3. After finding the row numbers of the players, we compare their score values to the par value given in the \"to par\" column of their respective rows. The \"to par\" value indicates how many strokes above par each player is.\n4. By looking at the scores for David Edwards (row 5) and Corey Pavin (row 10), we can see that both players' scores are equal to 142. We then compare these scores with their respective \"to par\" values, which are -2 for David Edwards and -1 for Corey Pavin.\n5. Finally, we check whether the differences between each player's total score and par match their given \"to par\" values. For David Edwards (-2) and Corey Pavin (-1), this condition is satisfied since 142 - 71 (his first score) = 71 and 143 - (69 + 72) = 71, which are both equal to their respective \"to par\" values.\n\n   The answer to the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the final answer and relevant cells:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify players in the claim: David Edwards and Corey Pavin\",\n    \"Find row numbers of each player: row 5 for David Edwards, row 10 for Corey Pavin\",\n    \"Compare scores to 'to par' values for each player\",\n    \"Check if differences between total score and par match the given 'to par' values\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"to par\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"to par\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
