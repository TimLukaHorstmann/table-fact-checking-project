We look at the 'wins' column to determine the number of victories for each position. Positions with 5 matches should have 5 or fewer loses because they win some of their matches. By inspection, only Position 1 has 5 wins and no loses, which means it wins all of its matches. However, there are other positions with fewer losses (4, 3, and 2), but since we're looking for the one that wins all of its matches, we focus on Position 1.\n\nThe claim is partially correct because every position has 5 matches, but only one of them (Position 1) wins all of them.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check if every position has 5 matches by examining the 'matches' column.\",\n    \"Ensure that there is only one position with a win in every match by inspecting the 'wins' and 'loses' columns.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"matches\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wins\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"loses\" }\n  ]\n}",
