This team appears twice, once in 2011 for British Formula Three with 170 points, and again in 2010 for Macau Grand Prix without any points mentioned (as points are not given for this series).\n\n2. Since we're interested in the row where Fortec Motorsport scored 170 points in the British Formula Three series, we will focus on that particular row. The relevant column names to examine are 'f / laps', which represents finishing/lapping positions, and 'points'.\n\n3. Examine the values for 'f / laps' and 'points' in the 2011 British Formula Three row: The value for 'points' is 170, and no value is provided for 'f / laps' (indicated as n/a). Since the claim asks if there were 2 finishing/lapping positions when Fortec Motorsport scored 170 points in British Formula Three series, it seems that we cannot find any direct evidence from the given table to answer this question.\n\n4. To provide a conclusive answer, it is essential to know whether having 170 points implies a specific number of finishing/lapping positions.
