    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the drivers from the table who belong to the American Spirit Team Johansson. This can be done by checking the \"team\" column for teams with 'american spirit team johansson'. The relevant drivers are Ryan Hunter - Reay and Jimmy Vasser, as per the rows with indices 24 and 25 respectively.\n\n2. Check the number of points for each driver. In our table, we can see that neither Ryan Hunter - Reay nor Jimmy Vasser have more than 2 points (they have 1 point in the table).\n\n3. Next, check the grid positions for both drivers. We can see that Ryan Hunter - Reay is at position 9 in the grid and Jimmy Vasser is at position 16. Both their grid positions are larger than 4.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.

    "resp": "Chain of thought:\n1. First, we need to identify the drivers on the Patrick Racing team from the table. They are 'patrick carpentier' and 'oriol servi\u00e0'.\n2. Next, we filter out these two drivers to check if they have fewer than 2 points. From the table, both 'patrick carpentier' and 'oriol servi\u00e0' have less than 2 points.\n3. We then check if their grid positions are larger than 4. 'patrick carpentier' has a grid position of 15 which is greater than 4. 'oriol servi\u00e0' does not have a specified grid position, so we cannot make a comparison with it at this moment.\n4. Since we found a driver from the Patrick Racing team (patrick carpentier) who has fewer than 2 points and grid larger than 4, we compare the remaining drivers to see if there are any more such cases. There are no other drivers on the table that meet this condition.\n5. Finally, we compare the two drivers 'patrick carpentier' and 'oriol servi\u00e0'. Since they both meet the conditions, but 'patrick carpentier' is the only one who has a specified grid position, he fits the claim more accurately. Therefore, we can say that there is at least one driver (patrick carpentier) on the Patrick Racing team who has fewer than 2 points and grid larger than 4.\n\nAnswer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
