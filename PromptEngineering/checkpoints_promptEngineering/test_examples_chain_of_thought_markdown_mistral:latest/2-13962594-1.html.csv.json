    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that all games at Shea Stadium had a total score less than 20 points.\n\n2. Locate the relevant data: From the table, we can see that all games taking place at \"shea stadium\" are relevant to this claim.\n\n3. Examine the relevant data: We need to check if the sum of the points from both teams (home and away) for each game at Shea Stadium is less than 20.\n\n4. Calculate the total score for each game: For each row where the \"game site\" column equals \"shea stadium\", add the values in the \"result\" column to find the total points for that game. Compare this sum with 20, if it's less then move on to the next game, otherwise reject the claim.\n\n5. Verify the result: Based on the calculations and comparisons from step 4, we can determine if the claim is true or false.\n\nIn this table, the total points for each game at Shea Stadium are as follows:\n- Game 1 (row 1): 23 + 7 = 30 (False)\n- Game 2 (row 2): 34 + 10 = 44 (False)\n- Game 5 (row 5): 9 + 7 = 16 (True)\n- Game 9 (row 9): 33 + 13 = 46 (False)\n- Game 11 (row 11): 28 + 20 = 48 (False)\n- Game 12 (row 12): 20 + 17 = 37 (False)\n- Game 13 (row 13): 24 + 23 = 47 (False)\n- Game 14 (row 14): 34 + 14 = 48 (False)\n\nSince at least one game has a total score greater than or equal to 20, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Locate relevant data\",\n    \"Examine the relevant data\",\n    \"Calculate total score for each game\",\n    \"Verify the result\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"game site\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"game site\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"game site\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"game site\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"game site\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"game site\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"game site\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"game site\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
