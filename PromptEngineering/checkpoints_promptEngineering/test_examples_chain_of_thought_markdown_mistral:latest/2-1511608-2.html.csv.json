Identify the claim's conditions: The net profit/loss for the year with -114000000 is -6.58 and the average number of employees for that year is larger than 31034.\n\n2. Find the row corresponding to the year -114000000: Since the table shows data from years 1999 to 2010, we can infer that the claim's year corresponds to the year 2001 as it is closest to -114000000.\n\n3. Compare the net profit/loss and basic EPS values for the identified row: In the table, the net profit/loss for the year 2001 is 2273000000 sek, which does not match -114000000 as per the claim. So, the first condition is FALSE.\n\n4. Compare the average number of employees with the provided threshold: In the table, the average number of employees for the year 2001 is 35640 (since we found it from the \"passengers flown\" column using the given ratio of employees per passenger). This value is larger than the threshold provided in the claim (31034), so this condition is TRUE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the conditions in the claim, find the year corresponding to the net profit/loss provided in the claim, compare the net profit/loss and basic EPS values, compare the average number of employees with the provided threshold.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"net profit / loss (sek)\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"basic eps (sek)\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"employees (average / year)\" }\n  ]\n}",
