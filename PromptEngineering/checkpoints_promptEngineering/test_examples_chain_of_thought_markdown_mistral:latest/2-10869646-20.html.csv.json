Iterate through each row in the table (i.e., each game) and compare their respective crowd sizes to the smallest one found in step 2. If at any point during iteration we find a game with an identical crowd size, then we have found a draw for the second smallest crowd.\n\nNow let's check the crowd sizes:\n- Row 1 (essendon vs north melbourne): 19229\n- Row 2 (collingwood vs richmond): 36729\n- Row 3 (carlton vs fitzroy): 13400\n- Row 4 (south melbourne vs geelong): 12176\n- Row 5 (Melbourne vs footscray): 17951\n- Row 6 (hawthorn vs st kilda): 21561\n\nThe smallest crowd size is found in row 4: 12176.
