Since the score on that row is 4 - 9, we know we have found the correct player. The row index in this table for Seo's match against Florida is 8.\n\n2. Now, let's find out if he lost the game. We can do this by checking if the score column has a negative value (indicating a loss). In our case, the score on row 8 is 3 - 0, which is not negative, so Seo did not lose that game.\n\n3. Finally, let's verify the attendance for the game where Seo played against Florida. We do this by looking at the \"attendance\" column of row 8.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the opponent for which we are looking for games where Leiter had a loss. In this table, there are multiple instances where Leiter lost a game, but we are interested in finding the game attended by 29,704 people with Chicago as the opponent.\n\n2. Check each row in the table to see if the opponent matches 'Chicago' and the loss is attributed to 'leiter (9 - 7)'. No such match is found.\n\n3. However, there are multiple instances where Leiter had a loss but the opponent is not specified ('<1000'). This could potentially include games against Chicago if they were home games for Atlanta. To find this out, we need to look at the other columns to determine if these matches were played between the two teams.\n\n4. In the 'date' column, we notice that there is a sequence of dates (13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th) where Leiter had a loss but no opponent is specified. We can cross-reference this with the 'attendance' column to see if it was an event attended by more than 29,704 people, as that would narrow down our search significantly.\n\n5. In the 'attendance' column, we find that there are no instances where the attendance is above 1000 (the minimum value for which an attendance figure is provided) on these dates. This indicates that it's unlikely that Leiter lost a game to Chicago on these dates with an audience of more than 29,704 people.\n\n6. Given that we cannot find the requested match in the table and that there are no instances where the attendance is high enough and the opponent is not specified as 'Chicago', we have to conclude that \"leiter (9 - 7) have the loss of the game attended by 29, 704 with chicago as opponent\" is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells for this reasoning are:\n[\n  { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" }\n]\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify opponent and look for games where Leiter had a loss with Chicago as the opponent\",\n    \"Check each row for matches\",\n    \"Consider instances where opponent is not specified but the match could be against Chicago\",\n    \"Cross-reference 'date' and 'attendance' columns to narrow down the search\",\n    \"Determine that there are no instances with high enough attendance where opponent is not specified as 'Chicago'\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" }\n  ]\n}",
