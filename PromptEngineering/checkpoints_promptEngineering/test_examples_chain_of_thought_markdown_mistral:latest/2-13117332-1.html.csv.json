In this case, we are looking for players who played at both the Brisbane International and China Open tournaments.\n\n2. Scroll through the table and find rows that match our condition. We find two players: Andrea Petkovic (row 3) and Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska (row 5). However, we are only interested in Andrea Petkovic since the claim mentions her specifically.\n\n3. Verify if there is any other evidence in the table that proves or disproves the claim. In our case, we see that Andrea Petkovic did play at the Brisbane International (row 3) but there is no row for China Open in the table.\n\n4. Cross-check the dates of the tournaments to ensure that if they played at both, the sequence would be plausible. In this case, we see that the Brisbane International was in January (2011), and the China Open was in October (2011). The order seems feasible, but we don't have direct evidence from the table.\n\n5. Since we didn't find any contradictory evidence in the table and the sequence of events seems plausible, we can say that it is possible that Andrea Petkovic played the China Open after playing at the Brisbane International, but we don't have direct evidence from this table to confirm it.\n\nNow, here is the output in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify players who could match the condition (played at both Brisbane International and China Open).\",\n    \"Find rows for these players in the table.\",\n    \"Verify if there is any other evidence in the table that proves or disproves the claim.\",\n    \"Cross-check the dates of the tournaments to ensure the sequence is plausible.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
