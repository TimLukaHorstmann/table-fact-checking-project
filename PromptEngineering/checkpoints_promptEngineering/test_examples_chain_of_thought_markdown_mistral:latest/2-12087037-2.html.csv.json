If every row has 42 entries, then it means no club has played more than 42 times as they all have the same number of games played.\n\nIn this case, since all the rows have 42 entries, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Check if all rows have the same number of rows (42), as it means no club has played more than 42 times.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {...
