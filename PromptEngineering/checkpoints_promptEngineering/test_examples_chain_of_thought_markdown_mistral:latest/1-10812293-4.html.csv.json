Check the column 'score' for this row to see who the highest scorer was in that game.\n3. The value in the 'score' column for row 28 is 24, which indicates TJ Ford scored 24 points on December 23rd.\n4. Since we have found a match where the score is equal to 24 and this is the maximum score for any game on that date, it implies that TJ Ford was indeed the highest scorer on December 23rd.\n\nThe final answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the game on December 23rd\", \"Check the 'score' column for this row\", \"Compare the value with other scores to determine if it is the highest\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]",
