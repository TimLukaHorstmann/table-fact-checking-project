    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we examine the table to understand its structure and content. The table contains information about weekly NFL games, including the date, opponent, result, attendance, and week number.\n\n2. Then, we look for the row that matches the week number specified in the claim (14). In this table, there are 14 rows corresponding to each week of the season.\n\n3. Next, we check if there's a date in the \"date\" column for the found row (week 14) that matches the date provided in the claim (\"september 26 , 1971\"). However, there are no matches between the date and week numbers.\n\n4. Finally, we verify if the attendance value for the found row (week 14) equals the attendance specified in the claim (57895). Since there is no such row with a match for the given week number, we don't need to perform this step.\n\nThe final answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Examine the table structure and content\",\n    \"Find the row that corresponds to week 14\",\n    \"Check if the date for found row matches with the given claim's date\",\n    \"Verify if the attendance value for the found row equals the given attendance\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
