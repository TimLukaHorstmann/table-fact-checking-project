If there are multiple rows matching the condition, I will check if they all have the same win-loss record (sum of wins minus sum of losses). In this case, since there is only one row that matches the condition, we can directly compare its win and loss values.\n4. Check the 'score' column to find out how many wins this team had on July 20 (in this case, it should be 14 as per the claim).\n5. Check the 'loss' column to find out how many losses this team had on July 20 (in this case, since the loss is not mentioned for that row, we cannot verify it directly from the table). However, if there were no losses for this date in the table, then it would imply a win-loss record of 14-0, which is different than the claimed record.\n6.
