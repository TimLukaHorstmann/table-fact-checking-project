Identify the number of rows in the table where the 'games' column equals 7, which is 8 (as there are 8 rows with the value \"7\" in the 'games' column).\n2. Check each row where 'games' equals 7 to find a match for the conditions specified in the claim:\n   - The number of drawn games should be 0 (in the 'drawn' column)\n   - The number of lost games should be 4 (in the 'lost' column)\n   - The point differential should be 19 - 19 (in the 'points difference' column)\n   - The total points should be 6 (in the 'points' column)\n3. Find out whether there is a match for the conditions specified in the claim among the rows where 'games' equals 7.\n\nThe relevant cells to consider are:\n- Row_index=1, Column_name='drawn' (since this row has values closest to the condition of drawn=0)\n- Row_index=1, Column_name='lost' (since this row has values closest to the condition of lost=4)\n- Row_index=1, Column_name='points difference' (since this row has values closest to the condition of point differential=19 - 19)\n- Row_index=1, Column_name='points' (since this row has values closest to the condition of points=6)\n\nBased on the table and my reasoning:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the number of rows where 'games' equals 7\",\n    \"Check each row for the specified conditions (drawn=0, lost=4, point differential=19 - 19, points=6)\",\n    \"Find out whether there is a match among the rows where 'games' equals 7\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"drawn\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"lost\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"points difference\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
