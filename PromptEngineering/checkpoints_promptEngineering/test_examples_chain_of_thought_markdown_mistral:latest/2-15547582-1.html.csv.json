Check if there exists a row where the industrial and commercial panel is greater than 1, the labour panel is greater than 1, the nominated by the taoiseach is less than 11, and the cultural and educational panel is smaller than 0.\n2. Examine each row of the table to check the conditions mentioned in step 1.\n3. Compare the values from the examination with the conditions:\n   - The 'industrial and commercial panel' should be greater than 1 for at least one party, but all values are 0 or less than 1.\n   - The 'labour panel' should be greater than 1 for at least one party where the industrial and commercial panel is greater than 1, but all such cases do not exist.\n   - The 'nominated by the taoiseach' should be less than 11 for at least one party, but all values are either equal to or greater than 9.\n   - The 'cultural and educational panel' should be smaller than 0 for at least one party where the nominated by the taoiseach is less than 11, but no such cases exist.\n\nSince none of the conditions in step 3 are met, the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Check if there exists a row where industrial and commercial panel > 1, labour panel > 1, nominated by taoiseach < 11, and cultural and educational panel < 0\", \"Examine each row of the table to check conditions\", \"Compare values with conditions: none of the conditions are met\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"industrial and commercial panel\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"labour panel\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"nominated by the taoiseach\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"cultural and educational panel\" }\n  ]\n}",
