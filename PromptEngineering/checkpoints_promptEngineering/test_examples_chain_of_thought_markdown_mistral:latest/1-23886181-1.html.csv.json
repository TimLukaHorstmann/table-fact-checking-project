Identify the claim: The claim states that Beijing Guoan is one of the 2 football clubs in Asia, and participated in the 2008 and 2010 seasons.\n\n2.

So far, the claim seems plausible.\n\n4. Verify if Beijing Guoan participated in the 2008 and 2010 seasons: To do this, we check the 'seasons' column for row 12 (Beijing Guoan). The seasons listed are 2008 and 2010.\n\n5. Compare the findings with the claim: The team from Asia that participated in the 2008 and 2010 seasons is Beijing Guoan, which also belongs to Asia.

Identify the claim's components: The claim states that \"fc basel 1893 be 1 of the 2 football club in asia, and participate in the 2008 an 2010 season\". This means we need to check if fc basel 1893 is associated with Asia and if it has participated in the seasons 2008 and 2010.\n\n2. Check for association with Asia: Scan through the table to find rows where \"continent\" equals 'Asia'. There is only one such row (row index 7, column name \"continent\"). The associated football club in that row is \"team japan\". However, we are looking for \"fc basel 1893\", which is not found. So far, fc basel 1893 does not seem to be associated with Asia.\n\n3. Check participation in seasons 2008 and 2010: Scan through the table again to find rows where the seasons column includes either '2008' or '2010'. There are several such rows, but we must now check if any of these rows have \"fc basel 1893\" in the football club column. Again, there is no such row.
