    "resp": "Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the structure of the table: each row represents a different player, their country, their score, and their position (place).\n2. To determine if `t2` is the place for a 66 score, we need to compare the scores in the 'score' column with 66.\n3. Looking at the table, we can see that only Kenny Perry has a score of 66 and he is placed in the first position (1). Since `t2` corresponds to positions 2 and above (as `t1` would be the first position), none of the players with scores lower than 66 could be in `t2`.\n4. Therefore, since no player in `t2` has a score of 66, it means that `t2` is not the place for a 66 score.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Understand table structure, compare scores to 66, check if any player in t2 has a score of 66\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
