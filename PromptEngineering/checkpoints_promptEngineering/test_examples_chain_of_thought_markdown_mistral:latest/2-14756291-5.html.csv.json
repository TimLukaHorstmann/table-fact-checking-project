    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the team we are analyzing, which is Bridgenorth. To do this, look for the row with 'bridgenorth' in the first column. In this case, it's the second row.\n2. Check the fourth column (wins) of the identified row to see how many wins Bridgenorth has. For Bridgenorth, there are 15 wins.\n3. Check the third column (losses) of the identified row to see how many losses Bridgenorth has. For Bridgenorth, there are 3 losses.\n4. Verify if the number of wins for Bridgenorth is greater than or equal to any other team in the table (column \"wins\"). By looking at the table, it can be seen that all other teams have fewer wins compared to Bridgenorth.\n5. Since there are no ties in the number of wins and losses, and Bridgenorth has a higher number of wins than any other team, we conclude that they indeed have the highest number of wins in the table.\n6. To confirm our conclusion, one could also verify that the sum of the rows (wins + losses) for all other teams is smaller than that of Bridgenorth (15 + 3 = 18), but this step is not strictly necessary to determine the claim's validity.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify 'bridgenorth', check wins and losses, compare with other teams\", \"Verify that Bridgenorth's wins are greater than other teams\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"losses\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n1. Identify the team we are looking for, which is George Town based on the claim.\n2. Find the row in the table corresponding to the team, in this case, it would be the 4th row since the first row represents Bridgenorth and so forth.\n3. Check the number of wins for George Town by looking at the \"wins\" column in the 4th row of the table.\n4. In the 4th row, under the \"wins\" column, we find that there are 9 wins for George Town.\n5. Check if the number of draws for George Town is less than 2 by looking at the \"draws\" column in the 4th row of the table.\n6. In the 4th row, under the \"draws\" column, we find that there are 1 draw for George Town.\n7. Compare the number of wins (9) and draws (1). Notice that 9 is greater than 8 and less than 2*8. Therefore, the number of wins (9) is less than or equal to 8 and the number of draws (1) is less than 2 as required by the claim.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find team mentioned in the claim\",\n    \"Identify corresponding row in the table\",\n    \"Check wins for that team\",\n    \"Check draws for that team\",\n    \"Compare number of wins and draws with requirements of the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wins\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"draws\" }\n  ]\n}",
