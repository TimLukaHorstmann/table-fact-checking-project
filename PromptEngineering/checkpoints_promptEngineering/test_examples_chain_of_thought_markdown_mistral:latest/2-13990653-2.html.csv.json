However, neither of the rows for \"chinatrust whales\" contains a player with the name \"Kao Lung - Wei\".\n5. As a result, we cannot confirm that \"chinatrust whale play against kao lung - wei\".\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Check if opponent's name matches 'chinatrust whales'.\", \"Find rows for 'chinatrust whales'.\", \"Check if any row contains player 'Kao Lung - Wei'.\", \"None of the found rows contain player 'Kao Lung - Wei.'\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"save\"},\n    // ...

In this table, there are two rows with the opponent as \"chinatrust whales\" (rows 3 and 5).\n2. Next, I look at the columns for the players' names. In both rows corresponding to \"chinatrust whales\", I find a player named \"pan wei - lun\". This means that both matches involving \"chinatrust whales\" had a player named \"pan wei - lun\".\n3. Now, I check the column for the score of each match. For the row corresponding to 3/22, the score is 7-9 in favor of chinatrust's opponent (the la new bears). For the row corresponding to 3/23, the score is 4-5, also in favor of chinatrust's opponent (against pan wei - lun).\n4. The claim states that \"pan wei - lun lose against chinatrust whale\". In both matches where \"pan wei - lun\" played against chinatrust whales, the score was in favor of chinatrust's opponents.

By looking through the table, I find that they played against Chinatrust Whales on 3/17 (row 1), but they did not have a save on this date. On 3/24, they lost again but without a save (indicating they did not play).
