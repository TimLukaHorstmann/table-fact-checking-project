However, there's no row in the table with a character name that matches 'Mr Perkins'. This suggests that Pauline Seville did not play Mr Perkins.\n2. Since Pauline Seville is listed in the table, we can find out which character she played. By examining the column \"Character\", we see that she played Martha Woodford.\n3. Next, we look for a row where the Character's name is 'Martha Woodford'. This character was played by Mollie Harris for 25 years (from 1970 to 1995), according to the table.\n4. We then compare this with the claim that Pauline Seville played Mr Perkins for 39 years in The Archers.
