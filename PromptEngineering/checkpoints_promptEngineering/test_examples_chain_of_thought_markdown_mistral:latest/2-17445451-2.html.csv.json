    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is true or false:\n\n1. Identify the opponent whose match duration is being questioned, which in this case is 'cleber luciano'.\n2. Scan through the table to find a row that matches the opponent's name in the 'opponent' column. In this table, there is only one row that matches ('win', '3 - 0', 'cleber luciano').\n3. Check if there is any information about the match duration in the given table. The relevant cell for the match duration is 'time'. For the matching row found above, the time is '7:57'.\n4. Compare the match duration obtained from step 3 with the claim given in the question. In this case, the match duration (7:57) matches exactly with the claim made.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the opponent whose match duration is being questioned\",\n    \"Scan through the table to find a row that matches the opponent's name in the 'opponent' column\",\n    \"Check if there is any information about the match duration in the given table\",\n    \"Compare the match duration obtained with the claim made in the question\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"time\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here is my reasoning:\n\n1. First, identify the events where TKO (cut) was used as a method of victory or defeat. From the table, we can see that TKO (cut) was used by opponents in two events: UFC 20 and EC 22.\n\n2. Next, filter these events to find occurrences in round 1. Since there are no instances where TKO (cut) occurred in round 1 in the UFC 20 event, we focus on the EC 22 event.\n\n3. Check the relevant row in the table for the Laverne Clark vs Cleber Luciano match from EC 22. If the round and time columns match with \"1\" and a time less than 1 minute, it would indicate that TKO (cut) happened in round 1 of the UFC 20 event.\n\n4. Finally, compare the filtered event and row to the original claim. If the filtered event matches the original event (\"UFC 20\") and the relevant row matches the conditions mentioned in the claim (round 1 and TKO (cut)), then the claim is true.\n\nThe JSON output will be:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify events where 'TKO (cut)' was used, Filter these events to find occurrences in round 1, Check relevant row for filtered event and compare with original claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"event\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"round\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"time\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
