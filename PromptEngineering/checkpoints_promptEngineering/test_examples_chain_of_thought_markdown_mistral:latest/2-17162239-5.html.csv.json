Compare the calculated difference with the given claim that \"Fred Funk's score be 6 stroke higher than Lee Janzen's score.\" The claim is satisfied if the difference between the two scores is equal to or greater than 6 strokes.\n\n4.

Notice that the table contains a column named \"place\", which is not included in the claim. However, it's important to look at it for context since it shows the ranking of the players.\n3. The \"place\" column shows that some players share the same rank (t4, t6, etc.), indicating ties for certain places, but it does not specify a rank for first place.\n4. Since the claim asks about first place, I need to determine if any player has a rank of 1, which there isn't in this table.\n5. However, the players that share ranks (t4, t6) have the same score and are tied for those places.\n6. To find out if there are ties for first place, I need to check if any player has a rank lower than 4 (since t4 indicates a tie for fourth place).\n7. There isn't any player with a rank lower than 4, meaning that all the players tied at 4th place or higher, and there is no player in first place.\n8.
