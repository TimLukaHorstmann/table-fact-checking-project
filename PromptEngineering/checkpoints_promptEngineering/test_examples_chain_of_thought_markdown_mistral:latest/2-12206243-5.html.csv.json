First, I count the number of games played against the Brewers to determine how many total games there should be if none were postponed due to snow. The table contains 6 games played against the White Sox and 7 games against the Royals, making a total of 13 games so far.\n\n2. I then count the number of games actually listed for the Brewers which is 4 games (april 4, 5, 6, 13).\n\n3. Since there are only 4 games listed against the Brewers, but we know that the team has played 7 games against them from our previous calculation, this means that at least 3 games must have been postponed due to some reason (other than cold weather since those were the ones rescheduled for later in the year).\n\n4. I scan through the table to find if any of these postponed games are due to snow.
