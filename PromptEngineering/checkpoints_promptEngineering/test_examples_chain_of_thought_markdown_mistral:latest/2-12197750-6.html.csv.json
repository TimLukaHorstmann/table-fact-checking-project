Determine the value of the row corresponding to 'dannevirke high school' in the 'roll' column. Since it is the seventh row in the table, we will refer to its index as 6 (since counting starts from 0). The cell for this row and column combination is at [6, \"roll\"].\n3. Get the value of the cell at [6, \"roll\"]. In our table, the roll value for 'dannevirke high school' is 476.\n4. Compare the obtained roll value with other roll values in the table to find the highest roll. This can be done by iterating through each row and comparing its roll value with the previously found value (in this case, 476). Since no other value in the 'roll' column is greater than 476, we can conclude that 476 is indeed the highest roll in the table.\n5. The claim states that at 476, the highest roll belongs to 'dannevirke high school'.
