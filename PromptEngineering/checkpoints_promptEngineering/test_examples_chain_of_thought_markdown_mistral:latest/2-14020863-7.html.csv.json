Scan through the table to find the row(s) for Greg Hart and Stephane Robidas:\n   - Row 8: Greg Hart is listed with nationality Canada and team Kamloops Blazers (since he was part of this junior team, we can infer that he played there).\n   - Row 7: Stephane Robidas is also listed with nationality Canada, but the team is Shawinigan Cataractes (qmjhl), not Kamloops Blazers.\n3. Check if both players are on the same team: As we found out in step 2, Greg Hart plays for the Kamloops Blazers and Stephane Robidas does not.\n4.
