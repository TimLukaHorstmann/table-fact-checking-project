Since the claim mentions a fighter who has won 3 times in 1995 at Itapeua, Brazil, we look for records that match these criteria.\n\n2. We scan through the records and find four wins (rows) in 1995, with all occurring at Itapeua, Brazil:\n   - Row 1: joa mendes, knockout (strikes), 1995, itapeua, brazil\n   - Row 2: larry reynolds, knockout (strikes), 1995, itapeua, brazil\n   - Row 3: hector rodriguez, knockout (strikes), 1995, itapeua, brazil\n   - Row 4: larry reynolds, knockout (strikes), 1996, itapeua, brazil (this record doesn't match the criteria since it is in 1996)\n\n3.

The claim states that the fighter has 2 losses with an opponent named \"junior h\u00e9ctor rodr\u00edguez\" and both methods being wins for the fighter.\n\n3.
