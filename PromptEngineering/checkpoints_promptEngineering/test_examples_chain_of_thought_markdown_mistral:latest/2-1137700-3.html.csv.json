Go through each row to determine if the constructor affiliated with any given win is Williams-Renault or Benetton-Renault (since those are the only constructor names mentioned in the table).\n3. If a win is associated with either of these constructors, mark that winning constructor as being affiliated with Renault.\n4. After going through all the rows, check if every constructor affiliation is with Renault or not.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify column of interest (winning constructor), go through each row to determine constructor affiliation, and check if every constructor is affiliated with Renault.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winning constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winning constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winning constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"winning constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"winning constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"relevant but not winning constructor (as per claim)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"winning constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"winning constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"winning constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"winning constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"winning constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"winning constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"winning constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"winning constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"winning constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"winning constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"winning constructor\"}\n  ]\n}",
