    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to identify all the rows where the venue is 'the stoop'. From the table, there are only two such rows: row 29 (index 28) and row 31 (index 30).\n2. Next, for each of these rows, we will look at the goal column (column 'goals') to see the number of goals scored by 'mcnamara'.\n3. For row 29, 'mcnamara' scored 6 goals according to the table.\n4. For row 31, 'mcnamara' scored 4 goals according to the table.\n5. The claim states that 'mcnamara' scores 3 goals when the venue is 'the stoop'.\n6. Comparing this to the data from step 4, it can be seen that the claim does not match any of the available data for 'the stoop'. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows where venue is 'the stoop'\",\n    \"'mcnamara' goal count for each row in 'the stoop'\",\n    \"Compare the goal count to the claimed goal count\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"goals\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"goals\" }\n  ]\n}",
