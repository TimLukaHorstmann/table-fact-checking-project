Step 3: To find out Gary Player's position after one round, we need to know how many players are in a tie for fourth place. Count the number of players tied with Gary Player by checking their countries in the 'country' column. Since they all belong to the United States, we can assume that there are at least 4 players tied (as it is impossible for more than half the field to be tied).
