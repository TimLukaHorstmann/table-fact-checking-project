    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the tournament in question: The claim pertains to the PGA Championship.\n2. Check the conditions on top-25, cuts made, and wins:\n   - For the PGA Championship, the number of times it finished top-25 is 4 (cell C4). If this value were less than 4, the claim would be false. Since the condition is met, we continue to check other conditions.\n   - The PGA Championship has made cuts 6 times (cell F4). The claim states that it should have cuts made 6 when top-25 is greater than 0. Since this condition is already verified, the number of cuts made matches the expected value.\n   - Check if the PGA Championship has any wins: The PGA Championship does not have any wins (cell B4).\n3. Compare the win count with the given condition: According to the claim, a tournament with 0 wins and a top-25 greater than 0 AND cuts made 6 should have a top-5 greater than 0. For the PGA Championship, the top-5 result is 1 (cell D4), which meets the given condition.\n\nWith all conditions satisfied, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the tournament in question\", \"Check conditions on top-25, cuts made, and wins\", \"Compare win count with given condition\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"B\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"D\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"C\"}]\n}\n```",
