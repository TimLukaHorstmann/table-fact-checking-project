    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The table presents a series of games for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from week 1 to week 16 of the 1985 season. Each row represents one game, with columns for week number, date, opponent, result (with win indicated by a W and loss by an L), kickoff time, game site, attendance, and record.\n2. The 'record' column shows the overall win-loss record for each week after that week's game is played. Each row represents a different week, and we can see the record change over the course of the season as games are won or lost.\n3. To determine if the team ended their 1985 season with a 2 - 14 record, we simply need to look at the 'record' column for the last game played in week 16 and the penultimate game played in week 15.\n4. In row 15, we see that the Bucs lost to the Green Bay Packers (indicated by an L), and their record is 2 - 13. In row 16, they lost again to the Green Bay Packers (another L), making their record 2 - 14.\n5.

Iterate through each row of the table (from row 1 to 16) that has the opponent's name different from the Buccaneers (row indexes 1-9 and 11-14). For each row, look at the 'result' cell, as this contains the score against the Buccaneers in that game.\n   3. Compare each score with the current maximum score found so far. Initialize the maximum score to a low value (e.g., -1) to ensure that we find the largest score in subsequent iterations.\n   4. Stop iterating once we reach the row where the opponent's name is the Buccaneers (row index 10). This row represents the game where the Buccaneers scored against another team, and it does not affect our search for the maximum score against the Buccaneers.\n   5. If at any point during the iterations, we find a score that is greater than the current maximum score, update the maximum score found.\n   6. At the end of the iteration, compare the maximum score found with the initial value (-1). Since our aim is to find the maximum score against the Buccaneers, if the final maximum score found is not -1, it indicates that we found a game where the opponent scored more than 62 points (since -1 is an initialized low value), and thus the claim is false.
