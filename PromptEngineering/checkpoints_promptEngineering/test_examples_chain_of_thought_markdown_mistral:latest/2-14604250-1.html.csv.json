However, since the claim asks about the \"first\" game in 2003, we need to check if there's another game before this one.\n5. Check if there's a game before the identified game: Since the row number of the first game is 1 and it involves the New York Jets as opponents, which are not the Atlanta Falcons, there isn't any other game before the Washington Redskins vs. Atlanta Falcons match.\n6. Combine the findings to determine if the claim is true or false: The identified game between the Washington Redskins and Atlanta Falcons was the second game of the 2003 season.
