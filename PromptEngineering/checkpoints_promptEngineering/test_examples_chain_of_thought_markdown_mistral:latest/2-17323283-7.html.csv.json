    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Check the table to find the game number for which we want to identify the opponent and record (game 75).\n2. Search the table row by row, starting from the top. In the sixth row, we find the game number (row_index 5) that corresponds to game 75.\n3. The opponent in this row is found in the third column (column_name \"opponent\"), which is \"minnesota north stars\".\n4. To confirm the record of the opponent for game 75, we look for the same team in the table again, but this time search for the row where the \"opponent\" column matches \"minnesota north stars\".\n5. We find the row in the eleventh position (row_index 10), which corresponds to game 75 as it was our initial starting point and we are moving downwards through the table.\n6. In this row, the record is found in the fifth column (column_name \"record\"), which is \"48 - 15 - 12\". However, since the claim states that the opponent for game 75 be the minnesota north stars with a record of 48 - 14 - 11, we must compare this claimed record to the one found in the table.\n7. Comparing the records, we find a discrepancy between the record stated in the claim (48 - 14 - 11) and the record from the table (48 - 15 - 12).\n8. Since there is a discrepancy, we mark our answer as \"FALSE\". The opponent for game 75 in the table is indeed the minnesota north stars, but their stated record does not match the one provided in the claim.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the final answer and relevant cells:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find game number 75 in the table\",\n    \"Identify opponent for game 75 from row 5, column 3 (opponent)\",\n    \"Check record of opponent found in step 2 by searching for their name again in the table\",\n    \"Compare the provided record in the claim with the one found in the table for the same opponent\",\n    \"Mark answer as FALSE due to discrepancy between records\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"record\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. To find the lowest game number after March 2, we need to focus on rows where the 'march' column value is greater than or equal to 3 (March 3 and beyond).\n2. We are looking for a row where the opponent is the Detroit Red Wings. In this table, the opponent is listed as \"detroit red wings\" without any space between words. So we should look for rows with 'opponent' column value matching exactly \"detroit red wings\".\n3. Examine each row in the table to find a match. The first instance of Detroit Red Wings as an opponent is on row 67, with a game number of 11.\n4. Continue checking the remaining rows: 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 75, and 76. None of these rows have an opponent matching \"detroit red wings\". However, we've reached the end of the table without finding a new instance of the Detroit Red Wings as an opponent.\n5. The 'march' column value for row 67 is indeed greater than or equal to 3 (it is 11), and it has the Detroit Red Wings as the opponent. Therefore, this is the lowest game number after March 2 with the Detroit Red Wing as the opponent.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Focus on rows where 'march' >= 3 and look for rows with an opponent matching exactly 'detroit red wings'.\",\n    \"Examine each row in the table to find a match.\",\n    \"Determine that the first instance of Detroit Red Wings as an opponent is on row 67 (game number 11).\",\n    \"Check remaining rows and confirm there are no new instances of the Detroit Red Wings as an opponent.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 67, \"column_name\": \"march\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 67, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" }\n  ]\n}",
