Next, find the writers of each episode in the filtered set. To do this, I will look at the \"written by\" column.\n\n4. Now, count the number of female writers among these episodes. This can be done by looking for female names (joanna lee, al schwartz & bill freedman, ruth brooks flippen) in the \"written by\" column.\n\n5. In this case, there are 3 episodes that were written by a woman (episodes 3, 7, and 9).\n\n6. Finally, compare the count of episodes written by women with the total number of episodes in the first season. If the count is more than 3, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false. In this case, we have found that there are indeed more than 3 episodes (exactly 3) written by a woman in the first season of The Brady Bunch.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the number of episodes in the table\",\n    \"Filter out only the episodes belonging to the first season (season = 101)\",\n    \"Find the writers for each episode in the filtered set by looking at the 'written by' column\",\n    \"Count the number of female writers among these episodes\",\n    \"Compare the count of episodes written by women with the total number of episodes in the first season\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"written by\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"written by\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"written by\" }\n  ]\n}",
