    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. First, we need to check each row in the table. We know the claim is about a home team score of 21.16 (142).\n\n2. We compare this number with the 'home team score' column in each row.\n\n3. If we find a match, we then need to identify if that particular row corresponds to 'fitzroy' as the 'home team'.\n\n4. If both conditions are met (matching home team score and home team), then the claim is true. Otherwise, it is false.\n\nNow, let's look at each row:\n\n- Row 1: footscray has a score of 7.8 (50) which does not match the claimed score (21.16 or 142). So this can be discarded.\n- Row 2: fitzroy has a score of 21.16 (142). However, it is listed as the home team. Since the claim is about a 'home team' score, this does not match the claim. So this can also be discarded.\n- Row 3: north melbourne has a score of 22.18 (150) which does not match the claimed score (21.16 or 142). So this can be discarded.\n- Row 4: hawthorn has a score of 20.20 (140) which does not match the claimed score (21.16 or 142). So this can be discarded.\n- Row 5: essendon has a score of 20.17 (137) which does not match the claimed score (21.16 or 142). So this can be discarded.\n- Row 6: swans do not have a score of 21.16 (142). So this can be discarded.\n\nSince we've discarded all rows without finding a match, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Compare each home team score with the claimed score (21.16 or 142).\",\n    \"Check if a matching home team score corresponds to 'fitzroy'.\",\n    \"Discard rows where the home team score does not match the claimed score.\",\n    \"Discard rows where 'fitzroy' is not the home team.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
