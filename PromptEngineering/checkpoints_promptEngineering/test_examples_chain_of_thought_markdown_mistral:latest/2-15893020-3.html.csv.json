    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the player for whom we need to find the average (Deon Kruis).\n2. Locate the row in the table that corresponds to Deon Kruis (row 14).\n3. Note that there are no values in the \"runs\" column for this player, indicating he has not scored any runs yet.\n4. In the \"average\" column, the value is marked as \"n/a\". This is because, according to cricket rules, the average can only be calculated when a player has faced multiple deliveries and either been out or retired hurt. Since Deon Kruis has not scored any runs yet, he does not have an average.\n5. Therefore, we cannot confirm if the claim that \"average be 0.1 for deon kruis\" is true as his average is currently marked as \"n/a\".\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify player (Deon Kruis)\",\n    \"Locate row in the table corresponding to Deon Kruis\",\n    \"Note that there are no runs scored by Deon Kruis\",\n    \"The average for Deon Kruis is marked as 'n/a'\",\n    \"Since the average cannot be calculated without a minimum of one delivery faced, it's impossible to confirm if the claim is true.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"runs\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"average\" }\n  ]\n}",
