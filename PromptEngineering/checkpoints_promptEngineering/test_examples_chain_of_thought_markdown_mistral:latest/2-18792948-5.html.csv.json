If the series for \"bell hoppy\" is 'mm', then the production number (found in the \"production number\" column) should match the claim's statement.\n\n4. In our selected row, the series indeed corresponds to 'mm'. The next step is to verify if the production number provided in the claim matches the one from the table for \"bell hoppy\".\n\n5.
