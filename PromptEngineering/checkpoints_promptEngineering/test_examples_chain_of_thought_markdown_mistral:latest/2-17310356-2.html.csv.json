Check the \"minister\" column for Giorgia Meloni: We see that Giorgia Meloni is listed as the minister for youth policies, which corresponds to the fifth row of the table.\n  3. Find the date when Giorgia Meloni took office: In the fourth column of the table (titled \"took office\"), we find that Giorgia Meloni took office on May 8th, 2008.\n  4. Check if Giorgia Meloni left office within 1 year: We need to find the date when Giorgia Meloni left office. In the fifth column of the table (titled \"left office\"), we see that she left office on November 16th, 2011.\n  5. Compare the dates and calculate the time difference: To determine if Giorgia Meloni left office within 1 year after taking office, we will compare these two dates. A simple way to do this is by finding out how many months have passed between these dates. November 2011 has 5 months (from May to November), so in total it's 6 months + 1 year = 17 months since she took office on May 8th, 2008.\n  6. Compare the calculated time difference with 1 year: The claim states that Giorgia Meloni left office within 1 year.
