    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the team for which we need to check the home record: The claim mentions 'boston'.\n\n2. Identify the column that shows the team's record at home: In this table, the \"record\" column shows the overall record of each team, but not specifically their home record. However, since teams play a majority of their games at home, we can infer the home record by comparing the number of wins and losses when playing at home (which should be more than away games).\n\n3. Identify rows where the 'visitor' column shows the team's name: In this table, there are two rows where the 'visitor' column has the team name 'boston'. These rows are the 2nd row with index 1 and the 16th row with index 15.\n\n4. Check the 'score' column in the identified rows: In both rows, the 'score' column shows a series of numbers representing the score of each game (e.g., 2 - 10 for the second row). To find the home record, we need to identify games where Boston was the home team. Since teams play their visitors, we can determine this by looking at the scores: Games with an even number of goals scored are home games because they end in a win or loss (e.g., 2 - 10 indicates Boston lost at home).\n\n5. Sum up the wins and losses to check if the inferred home record matches the claim: By analyzing the 'score' column for each identified row, we find that Boston lost 7 games at home (rows 1, 2, 8, 16) and won 4 games at home (rows 5, 15). The total number of home games is 11. If we calculate the record as wins-losses-ties, it would be 4 - 7 - 0 which equals 30 - 37 - 0. Since ties are not given in this table, we cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim with the information provided. However, if we assume that ties are not possible (which is a reasonable assumption for a win-loss record), then the calculated home record of Boston does not match the claimed home record of \"34 - 30 - 9\".\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team for which we need to check the home record\",\n    \"Identify the column that shows the team's record at home\",\n    \"Identify rows where the 'visitor' column shows the team's name\",\n    \"Check the 'score' column in the identified rows and find games where Boston was the home team\",\n    \"Sum up the wins and losses to check if the inferred home record matches the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"visitor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    ...
