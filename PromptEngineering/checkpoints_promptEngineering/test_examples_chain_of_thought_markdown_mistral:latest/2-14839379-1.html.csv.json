    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify models that have 90% capacity after one year, which are 'hr - 3utgb', 'bk - 3mcc', 'sanyo hr - 4utg', 'hr - 4utg', 'bk - 4mcc' and 'hr - 4utg'.\n2. For each model, find the row that contains the information about its capacity after three years. Since some cells are n/a, we can only make a conclusion for models where the capacity after three years is provided.\n3. Examine the capacities after three years for each of these models: 'hr - 3utgb' has >80%, 'bk - 3mcc' has >80%, 'sanyo hr - 4utg' has 70%, and 'hr - 4utg' does not have a cell for capacity after three years.\n4. Since we found that some of the models with 90% after one year have more than 80% after three years, we can conclude that not all models with 90% after one year will necessarily have 80% after three years.\n5.
