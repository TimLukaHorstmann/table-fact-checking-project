Check if that venue is the MCG (from the date and team names, we can infer that it's the Melbourne Cricket Ground).\n\nBased on these steps, here is my reasoning:\n\n1. The venues for each match are: arden street oval, glenferrie oval, victoria park, kardinia park, lake oval, and mcg (based on team names and date).\n2.
