In this table, there are no such rows. However, we can find a row with the closest value, which is row 3 for the season 2007-08.\n2. Verify if the 'rebounds per game' column also matches a value of 15.0 for the same row. In this case, the value in row 3 is 15.0.\n3.

Check the points per game for Selection 1. The points per game for this selection are 18.1.\n\n3. Compare the calculated points per game with the claimed value.
