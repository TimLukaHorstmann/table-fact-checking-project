Next, locate the row in the table that corresponds to Russia in the 'country' column and check if there is any data for 'international tourist arrivals (2012)' for this country.\n3. Inspect the 'international tourist arrivals (2012)' cell of the row corresponding to Russia, which has a value of 25.7 million.\n4. Compare the claim with the data in the table: The data in the table matches the claim exactly.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Locate the row for Russia\", \"Check if there's data for international tourist arrivals (2012)\", \"Compare the claim with the data in the table\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\"}]\n}",

First, identify the region that corresponds to China (the country with the highest number of international tourist arrivals in 2012) from the 'unwto region' column. In this case, it is 'asia'.\n2. Next, find the row for China in the table and note the number of international tourist arrivals for both 2011 and 2012. For 2012, it is 57.7 million and for 2011 it is 57.6 million.\n3. Compare the number of international tourist arrivals in 2011 and 2012 for China (the country in the 'asia' region).\n4. In this case, the number of international tourist arrivals in 2011 (57.6 million) is slightly less than the number in 2012 (57.7 million), but since we are looking for a strict comparison of whether the number in 2012 is less than that in 2011, our claim is not correct.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the region associated with the highest international tourist arrivals in 2012 (China's region = asia)\",\n    \"Find the row for China and note down the number of international tourist arrivals in both 2011 and 2012\",\n    \"Compare the number of international tourist arrivals in 2011 and 2012 for the 'asia' region (57.6 million in 2011 vs 57.7 million in 2012)\",\n    \"Determine if the claim is true based on the comparison\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2011)\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\" }\n  ]\n}",
