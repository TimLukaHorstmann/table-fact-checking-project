    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find Russia's row index (since it is a horizontal table). From the table, Russia is located on the 10th row.\n2. Next, we check the column name for the \"round of 16\" ranking. This column is labeled as \"round_of_16\".\n3. Now, we can find the value in the row index 10 and column name \"round_of_16\". However, there's no data provided in this cell because it's denoted by 'nan'.\n4. The claim states that Russia has a round of 16 ranking of 229, but we couldn't find the supporting evidence for this claim as the table does not provide this information for Russia.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find Russia's row index to locate relevant data\",\n    \"Identify the column name for round of 16 ranking\",\n    \"Locate Russia's value for round of 16 ranking using row index and column name\",\n    \"Compare the claim with the found value\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"round_of_16\" }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the ranking round rank column, which is where we find the relative positions of each nation during the ranking round.\n2. Compare the values for Russia and Italy from the \"ranking round rank\" column to determine their relative positions.\n3. Based on the given table, Russia has a ranking round rank of 10 and Italy has a ranking round rank of 9. This means Italy is placed just ahead (i.e., before) Russia in the ranking round rank scale.\n4. To answer the claim, we need to find out whether Russia is placed just behind (i.e., after) Italy or not. Since Italy is ahead of Russia, it means Russia is indeed placed just behind Italy in the ranking round rank scale.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the ranking round rank column and compare values for Russia and Italy\", \"Determine relative positions of nations based on comparison\", \"Conclude that Russia is just behind Italy since Italy is ahead of Russia in ranking round rank\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"ranking round rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"ranking round rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
