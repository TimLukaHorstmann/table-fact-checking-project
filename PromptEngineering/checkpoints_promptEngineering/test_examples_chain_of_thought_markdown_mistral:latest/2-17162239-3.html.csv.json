    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. First, we compare the player's name (Scott Hoch) from the first row of the table with each player's country (United States) from the third column of the table to check if they are from the United States. Since all players in the table are from the United States, this is a yes.\n2. Next, we compare the score of Scott Hoch (66) from the fourth row and first column of the table with the 'to par' value (-4) from the same row and column to check if his score is not under 66. Since -4 is less than 66, this is a no.\n3. Finally, we compare the two results: If Scott Hoch is from the United States (yes from step 1) but his score is not under 66 (no from step 2), then the claim \"Scott Hoch with a score under 66 be not from the united state\" must be FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells for this problem are:\n[\n  { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\" }\n]\n\nThe final answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"[1.
