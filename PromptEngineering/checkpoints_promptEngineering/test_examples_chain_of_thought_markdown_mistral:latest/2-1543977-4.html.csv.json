Then, I find the row that corresponds to Tiger Woods' participation, which is also in 1999, and check his position (team or individual).\n\n6. Tiger Woods is listed as an individual winner in 1999, meaning he didn't have a runner-up.\n\n7. Since Santiago Luna & Miguel Angel Martin are listed as runners-up in the same year (1999) and Tiger Woods is not their teammate or direct competitor within this tournament, they can be considered the runner-ups behind Tiger Woods, though not necessarily in a direct competition with him.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim, find the row for 1999, examine the 'runners-up' column, check Tiger Woods' position and confirm they are not his direct competitors within the tournament\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"runners-up\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"individual\" }\n  ]\n}",
