To do this, I will look for rows in the table where the 'game site' column mentions \"mile high stadium\".\n\n2. Based on the table provided, the following matches were played at Mile High Stadium: Week 1 (September 12 vs San Diego Chargers), Week 2 (September 19 vs San Francisco 49ers), Week 10 (November 21 vs Seattle Seahawks), Week 14 (December 19 vs Kansas City Chiefs).\n\n3. Now, I need to find the weeks corresponding to Week 12 and Week 14 in the table. To do this, I will count the number of rows before and after the matches played at Mile High Stadium that I identified in step 2.\n\n4. There are nine (9) games listed in total. Since there are two games played at Mile High Stadium (in weeks 1 and 2), there must be six other games left between Weeks 2 and 10, and four more games from Week 10 to the end of the season (Week 16).\n\n5. Counting six games forward from week 2 (which is week 8, week 9, week 10, week 11, week 12, and week 13), we find that week 12 occurs at the seventh row of the table, and counting four more games forward brings us to week 16.\n\n6. Comparing the weeks mentioned in the claim (Week 12 and Week 14) with our findings from step 5, we can see that both weeks are present in the table during the Denver Broncos' 1982 season.\n\n7. Finally, to confirm the answer, I will check that each of the relevant weeks corresponds to matches played at Mile High Stadium:\n   - Week 12 (row index 6) is listed as being played at Mile High Stadium\n   - Week 14 (row index 8) is listed as being played at Mile High Stadium\n\nNow, here's the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify matches played at Mile High Stadium, Count number of games before and after those matches to find weeks 12 and 14, Check that both weeks correspond to matches played at Mile High Stadium.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find the total attendance for each game in the season. We can do this by reading the \"attendance\" column of the table.\n2. Next, we need to find the attendance for week 16. This will be the value in row 7 (index 6) of the \"attendance\" column. In this case, it is 74192.\n3. Now, we need to compare the attendance for week 16 with the attendances for all other games in the season. To do this, we can simply look at the other values in the \"attendance\" column and compare them to 74192.\n4. After comparing all the values, we can conclude that 74192 is indeed the smallest attendance of all the games in the season.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find total attendance for each game by reading 'attendance' column\", \"Find attendance for week 16 (row 7)\", \"Compare the attendance for week 16 with attendances of all other games\", \"Conclude that week 16 has the least amount in attendance\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}]\n}",
