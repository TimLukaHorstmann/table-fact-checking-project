From the table, we can see that rank 5 (ruth - beatrice lang / michael zenkner) is from tsva, and rank 6 (carolin frenzel / clemens dialer) has a club name that seems to be split between tsva and ercf. However, it's important to note that the table indicates \"tsva / ercf\" as one entity for rank 6.\n\n2. Check if two contestants from the same club can be in different ranks in a championship. While there might be multiple teams within a club, the fact that they are still competing under the same club name implies they are part of the same organization.
