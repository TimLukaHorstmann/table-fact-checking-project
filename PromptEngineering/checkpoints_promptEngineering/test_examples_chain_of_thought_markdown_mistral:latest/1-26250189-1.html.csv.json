Identify the claim: The claim is about the song choice for the first solo performance, which is said to be \"for one time in my life\" by Stevie Wonder.\n\n2. Find the row corresponding to the first solo performance: We know that the first solo performance occurs during Hollywood week, so we look for rows with 'theme' as 'first solo performance'. There is only one such row, and its index is 2.\n\n3. Check the song choice in that row: The song choice for the row we found (index 2) is 'for once in my life', which matches the claim.\n\n4. Confirm the original artist of the song: In the same row, we find that the original artist of the song is Stevie Wonder, which also matches the claim.\n\nSince all parts of the claim are supported by data from the table, our final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Find the row corresponding to first solo performance\", \"Check the song choice in that row\", \"Confirm the original artist of the song\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"theme\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"original artist\"}]\n}",
