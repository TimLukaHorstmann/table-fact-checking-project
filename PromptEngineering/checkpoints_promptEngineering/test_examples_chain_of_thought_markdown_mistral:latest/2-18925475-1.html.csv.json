Find the corresponding rows in the table where this feature is mentioned: amt 1.0 (desktop), amt 2.0 / 2.1 (desktop), amt 2.0 / 2.1 (wireless), amt 3.0, amt 4.x, amt 5.x, amt 6.x\n3. Notice that the feature is only mentioned in rows for versions lower than amt 3.0. This means it's not explicitly listed for amt 3.0.\n4. However, the presence of a feature in a newer version often implies backward compatibility, meaning the feature may still be available in older versions.\n5. In this case, since there are no indications that the feature was removed or deprecated, it's reasonable to assume that it could still be available in amt 3.0.\n6. To confirm, I would need to inspect further documentation or code related to amt 3.0, but based on the information provided, it's not possible to definitively say whether the feature is available in this version.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the feature of interest\", \"Find its corresponding rows\", \"Notice absence from amt 3.0 row\", \"Consider backward compatibility\", \"Make a tentative assumption about availability based on lack of explicit deprecation\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\" (Assuming backward compatibility),\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"vlan settings for intel amt network interfaces\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"vlan settings for intel amt network interfaces\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"vlan settings for intel amt network interfaces (wireless)\"}]\n}",

This feature appears under 'amt 6.0 (desktop & mobile)' and 'amt 7.0 & 8.0 (desktop & mobile)'.\n2. Next, I will check if there is any version of AMT (Advanced Management Technology) prior to 6.0 that has this feature. Since the feature doesn't appear in any versions below 6.0, it can be inferred that this feature is not available for versions lower than 6.0.\n3.
