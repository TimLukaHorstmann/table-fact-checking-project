    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the row corresponding to rank 1 (row_index = 1).\n2. Check the total column for row 1 (column_name = \"total\"). The value is 22.\n3. Compare this total with the claim's requirement of more than 21. Since 22 > 21, the condition holds true.\n4. Identify the gold column for row 1 (column_name = \"gold\"). The value is 13.\n5. Verify that the total gold medal is 13 according to the claim. Since the identified gold value matches the claimed value of 13, it is consistent with the condition.\n6. As all steps are satisfied and the conditions hold true for both requirements (total more than 21 and total gold as 13), the claim is valid.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify row corresponding to rank 1\",\n    \"Check total column for this row\",\n    \"Compare total with claim's requirement of more than 21\",\n    \"Verify gold column value for this row\",\n    \"Confirm if total gold matches the claimed value\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\" }\n  ]\n}",
