Next, I find the score column (column name \"score\") in that specific row to see if there's a match with the claim of \"12 to 1\". In the second row, the score for Elon is indeed \"12 - 1\".\n\n3. To confirm that Elon played against Clemson, I look for rows where both teams appear in the champion and runner-up columns. The only such occurrence is in the first row, where Duke (the champion) plays against Elon (the runner-up). However, in this case, Elon's score is not \"12 to 1\" as claimed.\n\n4. In the second row (the only other row with Elon as the champion), there is no Clemson in either the champion or runner-up columns, but the score matches the claim.\n\nBased on this analysis, I can see that Elon scored \"12 to 1\" against another team in a match, but it was not against Clemson.

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is true or false:\n\n1. Identify the year for which we need to check if Clemson came third (i.e., lost to the runner-up, who in turn lost to the champion). In this case, since the claim is about 2005, we will focus on the 2005 row.\n\n2. Check who the champion and runner-up were for that year by looking at the \"champion\" and \"runner-up\" columns in the 2005 row. In this case, Elon is the champion (score: 12 - 1) and Clemson is the runner-up (score: 6 - 5).\n\n3. To determine if Clemson came third, we need to check if there is a team that lost to both Elon (the champion) and Clemson (the runner-up). In this table, semi-finalist teams are those who have lost in the semifinals but did not necessarily lose to the eventual champion or runner-up. For 2005, the semi-finalists were Western Carolina, Longwood, Embry-Riddle, and North Florida.\n\n4. Analyze each of these teams' results:\n   - Western Carolina lost to Duke (the team that didn't even reach the semifinals in 2005).\n   - Longwood lost to Elon (the champion), but they did not play against Clemson.\n   - Embry-Riddle did not lose to either Elon or Clemson, as they were eliminated by Miami (semi-finalist 1) in the semifinals.\n   - North Florida lost to Miami (semi-finalist 1) but also did not play against Clemson.\n\n5. Based on the analysis, it is clear that no team other than Elon and Clemson (the champion and runner-up respectively) has a loss record against both of them.
