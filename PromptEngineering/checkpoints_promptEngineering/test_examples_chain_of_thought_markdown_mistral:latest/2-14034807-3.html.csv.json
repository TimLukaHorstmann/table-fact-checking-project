    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Identify all the rows where the opponent column contains the Washington Capitals (to do this, look for any row where \"washington capitals\" appears).\n2. For each game involving the Washington Capitals, check the score to see if it matches a record that ends with 3-2-0. This means we need to find a row where the \"score\" column shows a win by one goal (either 5-4 or 4-3) and the current record is such that adding another game (with the same outcome) would result in a 3-2-0 record.\n3. Since the table only provides the final scores and records, we cannot determine the exact sequence of games to find out if any game with Washington Capitals as the opponent has a record ending with 3-2-0. However, we can observe that there are two rows where the Washington Capitals were the opponents: row 5 and row 7. In both cases, they lost by one goal (either Washington won 5-1 or Washington lost 5-3). As this table does not provide the exact sequence of games, we cannot definitively say whether there exists a game where Washington was the opponent and the record ends with 3-2-0.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify rows where the opponent is Washington Capitals, check scores to see if they match a 3-2-0 record (win by one goal), observe sequence of games to determine if there exists a game with Washington as the opponent and 3-2-0 record.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]\n}",
