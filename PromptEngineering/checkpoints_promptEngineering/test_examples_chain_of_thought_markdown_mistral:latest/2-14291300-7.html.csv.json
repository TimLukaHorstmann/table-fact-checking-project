Compare the values in the 'points' column to find repeated scores that indicate multiple opponents have the same number of points.\n   3. Check the first row (row_index 0) since it has the lowest value in the 'points' column, which is 59. Since this is a unique score, we hypothesize that there should be only one opponent with 59 points.\n   4. Check the remaining rows to confirm whether any team has the same number of points as the Toronto Maple Leafs (row_index 7). If found, it would contradict our hypothesis.

In our table, the earliest game that happened after March 13 is the one in row 72 with a 'march' value of 24. So there was no game on March 13 according to this table.\n   2. Secondly, we need to check if any team's opponent on March 13 had a total score of 63 points at that time. Since no game took place on March 13 as per our findings in step 1, there won't be an opponent with 63 points on that day.\n   3.

Identify all the opponents from the 'opponent' column in the table.\n- detroit red wings, california golden seals, minnesota north stars, pittsburgh penguins, new york rangers, toronto maple leafs, montreal canadiens, chicago black hawks\n2. Find their respective 'points' (score) in the table by matching them with their row indexes.\n- detroit red wings: 59, california golden seals: 60, minnesota north stars: 60, pittsburgh penguins: 61, new york rangers: 61, toronto maple leafs: 63, montreal canadiens: 66, chicago black hawks (the team in question): Not yet found.\n3. Compare the points to determine if any team has 63 points. The only opponent with 63 points is the toronto maple leafs, and we haven't checked chicago black hawks yet.\n4. Check the row for the chicago black hawks, which has a score of 67. This means that the Chicago Black Hawks have more than 63 points (specifically 67).\n5. Since no other team in the list had 63 points, and we found one team with more points, it is TRUE that the chicago black hawk be the only opponent with 63 points (they actually have 67 points).",
