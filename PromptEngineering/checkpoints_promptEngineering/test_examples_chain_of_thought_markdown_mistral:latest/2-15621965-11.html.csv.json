From the years in Orlando column, check which of these Nebraskan players have a year range that matches the given 2003 - 2004 and/or 2009. The player Tyronn Lue has a year range 2003 - 2004.\n3. Check if there is another player from Nebraska with a different year range. No other players from Nebraska are listed in the table.\n4.
