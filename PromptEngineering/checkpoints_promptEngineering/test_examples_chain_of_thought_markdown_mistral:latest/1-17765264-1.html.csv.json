    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we identify the team by looking at the table header. The rows contain data for a single team, so we can assume this team is the subject of our claim.\n2. Next, we look for the row where the attendance is 9928. In the table, there's only one row with that attendance: row_index=14.\n3. We then examine the \"record\" column in that row to find out the team's record when the attendance was 9928. The value in this cell is '4 - 8 - 1'.\n4. To determine whether the claim is true, we compare the record (4) and the position of this record within the sequence of records for the team (i.e., 14th game). If the number of wins (4) equals the number of losses plus ties up to the 14th game, then the claim is true.\n\nThe team's record when the attendance was 9928 is '4 - 8 - 1', which means the team had 4 wins, 8 losses, and 1 tie by that point in the season. Since we are considering only wins (ignoring losses and ties) to compare with the number of games played before the 9928 attendance game, it turns out that the team has 4 wins up to the 14th game. This is equal to the number of games played before the 9928 attendance game (14), so the claim is true.\n\nIn JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify team from table header\",\n    \"Find row with attendance=9928\",\n    \"Examine record value in found row\",\n    \"Compare wins count to the number of games played before the 9928 attendance game\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" }\n  ]\n}",
