    "resp": "Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the player in question, which is Ann Strother (row 5).\n2. Check where she was playing her previous WNBA team (column \"former wnba team\"). The value for this row is 'indiana fever'.\n3. Check if she is from Connecticut (column \"college / country / team\"). The value for this row does not specify a state, but it mentions 'connecticut' as a separate entity.\n4. Recall that players can change teams and states throughout their careers. Therefore, it's possible to have played on an Indiana team while being from Connecticut.\n5. Compare the current team (column \"new wnba team\") with the former one. The current team is 'atlanta dream', which is not the same as her former team ('indiana fever').\n6. Consider the claim: \"Ann Strother (g) player be from Connecticut and never play on indiana fever\". Since she has played for Indiana in the past, this statement contradicts the information given in the table.\n7.
