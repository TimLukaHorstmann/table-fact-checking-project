Search for a row in the table that matches the name of the event: For each row, compare the \"event\" column with the event specified in the claim (i.e., \"wff mma : pascua yaqui fights 4\").\n3. If a matching row is found, examine the \"location\" cell to check if it matches the location specified in the claim: The relevant location for this event is Tucson, Arizona, United States.\n4. Check the \"round\" and \"time\" cells in the matched row to confirm if they match the time given in the claim (i.e., 1 round lasting 1:25).\n\nNow, let's output the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the event to verify: wff mma : pascua yaqui fight 4\",\n    \"Search for a row with matching event name\",\n    \"Examine the 'location' cell of the matched row\",\n    \"Check the 'round' and 'time' cells in the matched row\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"round\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"time\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the fights associated with the Gladior Challenge event. There are two such fights, one with record 4 - 0 against Miguelito Marti (row index: 2) and another with record 2 - 0 against Sean Henry Barnett (row index: 4).\n\n2. Identify the fights associated with the Pascua Yaqui event. There is only one such fight, with record 1 - 0 against Michael Poe (row index: 5).\n\n3. Compare the duration of each fight by examining the 'round' and 'time' columns. For Gladitor Challenge fights, the number in the 'round' column indicates the round at which the fight ended (e.g., row index 2 shows a '1' in the 'round' column, indicating that the fight ended in the first round). The 'time' column for these fights is empty because they ended before any time elapsed beyond the initial round. For the Pascua Yaqui fight, however, there is a value in both the 'round' and 'time' columns (row index 5 shows '1' in the 'round' column and '1:25' in the 'time' column).\n\n4. Since the fights associated with the Gladior Challenge event ended without any time elapsing beyond the initial round, they are shorter than the Pascua Yaqui fight which had a recorded time of 1:25 (row index 5).\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify fights associated with Gladior Challenge and Pascua Yaqui events\", \"Compare duration by examining 'round' and 'time' columns\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}",
