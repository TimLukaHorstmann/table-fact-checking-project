However, we need to count the total number of unique languages and compare it with the English language to determine if English has the most songs.\n\n2. Count the number of unique languages in the table:\n   - Start by listing all the languages present in the table: montenegrin, hebrew, english, serbian, german, finnish, italian, imaginary, slovene, bosnian, armenian, romanian, catalan.\n   - There are 12 unique languages in total.\n\n3. Count the number of songs in English:\n   - From the table, we can see that there are 5 rows where the 'language' column is 'english'.\n   - To find out the total points for these songs, sum up the values in the 'points' column for these rows (23 + 104 + 96 + 36 + 42 + 22 + 22 + 106 + 42 + 22 + 72 + 135 = 682).\n\n4.

From the table, we see 8 songs scoring less than 100 (rows 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15).\n\n2. Count the total number of rows in the table. There are 19 rows in total.\n\n3. Compare the count from step 1 with half the total number of rows from step 2. If the count from step 1 is less than or equal to half the total, then the claim is true.\n\nThe calculation: 8 (count from step 1) <= 9.5 (half of 19) returns TRUE.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Count the number of songs scoring less than 100 points; Count the total number of rows in the table; Compare the counts\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
