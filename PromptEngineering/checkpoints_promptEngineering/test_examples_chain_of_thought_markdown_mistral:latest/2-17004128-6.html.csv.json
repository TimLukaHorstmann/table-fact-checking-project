We compare each row's \"tie no\" value with 8.\n\n2. In the given table, the row with \"tie no\" 8 is the one with the team names \"birmingham city\" and \"wrexham\".\n\n3. To determine whether this match was a tie (or replay), we compare the number of rows before it (ties or replays are usually marked in the table by a separate row after the original match). In this case, there are no such rows before tie no 8. So, this wasn't a tie or replay.\n\n4. Now, we look at the \"home team\" and \"away team\" columns of the row corresponding to tie no 8. The home team is \"birmingham city\" and the away team is \"wrexham\".\n\n5. To verify whether the attendance was for wrexham, we check if there's a matching date of the attendance with any other row where the away team is \"wrexham\". However, there are no such rows in the table, so we cannot definitively say that the given claim about attendance is true or false based on this table.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the row corresponding to tie number 8\",\n    \"Check if it's a tie or replay by comparing with other rows before it\",\n    \"Compare the home and away teams for the given row\",\n    \"Try to find a matching attendance date for the away team\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"tie no\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"home team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"away team\" }\n  ]\n}",

This would contradict the claim that \"chelsea be the away team, when they play leicester city\". Therefore, not the case for this scenario.\n4. However, in the table there is a replay match where Chelsea and Leicester City are playing against each other again, and Chelsea is listed as the home team.
