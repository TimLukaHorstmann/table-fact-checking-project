In this table, there are 5 rows where the result is 'w', which means the Saints won those games. So, we need to check if there are any more wins in the season that are not included in the table.\n3. To do this, I compare the total number of weeks in a standard NFL season (16) with the number of weeks represented in the table (15), as the last week is missing from the table.\n4. Since there are 11 weeks left (16 - 5) and the Saints won only 5 games, it's unlikely that there will be more wins outside the table, especially considering that they lost their last game of the season (the 16th week).\n5. Therefore, I conclude that there are indeed only 5 weeks in the 1985 season where the New Orleans Saints won.\n\nHere's my final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Count number of wins for the New Orleans Saints\",\n    \"Compare total number of weeks in a standard NFL season with the number of weeks represented in the table\",\n    \"Assess if there are any more wins outside the table\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\" }\n  ]\n}",

The highest score in this context means the largest positive number.\n3.

Check the 'opponent' column for these rows to see if the opponents were at home or away:\n   - Row 14 opponent is 'st louis cardinals'. Since there's no information about home/away game, it's not possible to determine whether this was a home or away game. However, we can confirm that row 15 opponent is 'san francisco 49ers', which was indeed a home game according to the table.\n4. Since row 14 opponent (st louis cardinals) cannot be confirmed as a home or away game, we need to consider only row 15 for our final answer.\n5. The result of row 15 is 'l 31 - 19', which indicates a loss.
