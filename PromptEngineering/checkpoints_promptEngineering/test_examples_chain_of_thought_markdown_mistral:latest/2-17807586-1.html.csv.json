All years show a prize of $5000 or $10,000.\n2. Check if there is any year between 2008 and 2009 where the prize was different from the usual amount. If so, it would mean that the prize for winning the national school scrabble championship didn't double during these years.\n3. However, no such change in the prize amount is observed between 2008 and 2009. The prize remains at $5000 in both these years.\n4.

    "resp": "Reasoning steps:\n1. First, I identify the prize amount across all years, which is consistently $10,000 except for 2007 and 2008 where it's $5,000. This suggests that there might have been a change in the prize money at some point.\n2. Next, I look for any changes in the event director across years since they could influence the prize money. However, all years share the same event director (Ben Greenwood or variants of his name).\n3. Since the location and the event director are consistent across years, it seems that other factors might have led to the change in prize money between 2007 and 2008.\n4. Lastly, I examine the years provided in the claim (2007 and 2008) to see if there's any difference in the prize amount during those years compared to other years. In this case, I find that both years have a lower prize amount than the rest of the years ($5,000 vs $10,000).\n5. Based on these observations, it appears that the prize for winning the national school Scrabble championship doubled from 2008 to 2009.
