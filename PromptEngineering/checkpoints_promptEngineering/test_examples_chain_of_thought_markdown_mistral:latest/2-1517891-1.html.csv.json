Understand the table structure: The table contains details of various matches from different competitions, with date, venue, score, result, and competition as columns. However, it does not contain information about which players were involved in each match.\n3. Search for relevant rows: Since we are looking for matches related to the 2002 World Cup qualification, we focus on rows where the competition column mentions \"2002 world cup qualification\". There are three such rows with row_indices 8, 10, and 11.\n4. Check the year of each match: For each relevant row, check the date of the match to find out if it was in 2000. In this case, none of the matches in rows 8, 10, and 11 occurred in 2000. The closest match is from September 2, 2000 (row 8), but it did not involve Joseba Etxeberria since the table does not provide player information.\n5. Final answer: Based on the above reasoning, we can conclude that the claim \"in 2000, Joseba Etxeberria did not win the 2002 world cup qualification\" is TRUE.
