Next, I search through the table for a row that contains this date in the \"date\" column.\n3. I find that the 2nd row of the table corresponds to September 13, 1992.\n4. In the same row, I check the \"attendance\" column to find the attendance for this particular game.\n5. The value in the \"attendance\" column for this row is 44851.\n6. Finally, I compare this value with the claim that \"September 13, 1992 have attendance more than 44851\". Since the attendance on September 13, 1992 is indeed greater than 44851, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the output in the requested JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the date for which we need to determine the attendance (September 13, 1992)\",\n    \"Search through the table for a row that contains this date in the 'date' column\",\n    \"Find that the 2nd row of the table corresponds to September 13, 1992\",\n    \"Check the 'attendance' column for this row and find that it is 44851\",\n    \"Compare the attendance value with the claim (44851 >= 44851)\",\n    \"Determine that the attendance on September 13, 1992 is indeed greater than 44851, but the claim is false since it suggests the opposite\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\" }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Examine the table to understand its structure, including headers for week, date, opponent, result, and attendance.\n2. Note that the result column shows the outcome of each game as a score, e.g., \"w 20 - 10\" means win with a score of 20-10.\n3. Check the rows to find a match for the claimed week (13) and the claimed score (19 - 16).\n4. Find that in row 13, the opponent is \"detroit lions\", and the result is \"w 24 - 21\". Since the claimed score (19-16) does not match this result (24-21), we can conclude that the claim is not correct.\n5.
