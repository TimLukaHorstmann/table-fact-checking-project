    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that \"d beadman be the jockey at rosehill and the weight be 57.5 kg\".\n\n2. Examine the table columns: We need to look for rows where the 'jockey' is 'd beadman' and the 'venue' is 'rosehill'.\n\n3. Search through the table: In the provided table, there are two rows that match our search criteria. They are at row indices 1 and 8. The rows are as follows:\n    - Row index 1: result = \"2nd\", date = \"24 aug 2002\", race = \"warwick stakes\", venue = \"warwick farm\", group = \"g2\", distance = \"1400 m\", weight (kg) = \"57.5\", time = \"1:21.85\", jockey = \"d beadman\", winner / 2nd = \"1st - defier\"\n    - Row index 8: result = \"won\", date = \"08 mar 2003\", race = \"apollo stakes\", venue = \"randwick\", group = \"g2\", distance = \"1400 m\", weight (kg) = \"58\", time = \"1:22.49\", jockey = \"d beadman\", winner / 2nd = \"2nd - hoeburg\"\n\n4. Determine the relevance of the found rows to the claim: Both rows contain 'd beadman' as the jockey, but only row index 8 (the second match) contains 'rosehill' as the venue and '57.5' as the weight. This row matches both conditions in the claim.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Identify the claim. 2. Examine the table columns. 3.

    "resp": "chain_of_thought:\n1. First, we need to check if there is a row in the table where both the 'jockey' column matches 'd beadman' and the 'weight (kg)' column has a value of 57.8 kg.\n2. We observe that the weight values are all integers and do not match the provided value of 57.8 kg, so we can eliminate the possibility of finding a match in the table as it stands.\n3. However, the closest weight in the table is 57.5 kg, which is less than 57.8 kg but close enough to raise the question of whether there might be some inconsistency or rounding errors in the data. If that were the case, it could potentially allow for a match between 'd beadman' and a race at Warwick Farm with a weight greater than 57.5 kg but less than 58 kg.\n4. However, upon further inspection of the table, we find no row where 'jockey' is 'd beadman' and 'venue' is 'Warwick Farm'. Since there is no such row, we can conclude that 'beadman was not the jockey at Warwick Farm and the weight was not 57.8 kg.'\n\nanswer: \"FALSE\"\nrelevant_cells: []",
