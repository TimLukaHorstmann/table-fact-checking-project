Check the table for the row corresponding to episode number 10: To find the episode number 10, we look for a row where the \"no in season\" column equals 10. In our table, the rows are ordered by the \"no in series\" column, so we can scan through the table from the first row (row index 0) until we reach the row with \"no in series\" equal to 10.\n3. Check the title of the corresponding episode: Once we have found the row corresponding to episode number 10, we will check the \"title\" column for that row. If the title is \"reflections\", then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Check the table for the row corresponding to episode number 10\", \"Check the title of the corresponding episode\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"title\"}]\n}",
