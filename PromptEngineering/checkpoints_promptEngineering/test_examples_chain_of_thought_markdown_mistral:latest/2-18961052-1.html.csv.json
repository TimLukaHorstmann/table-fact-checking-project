Check the table to find out how many times the position 'd' appears. Since all the players labeled as 'd' are in the same row, simply count the rows containing the 'd' label. In this case, there are 4 rows with 'd'.\n4. Similarly, count the number of instances for other positions. For goalkeepers (gk), there is only one player ('merrill moses'). For center backs (cb), there are 2 players ('peter hudnut' and 'jesse smith') and for forwards (cf), there are also 4 players ('ryan bailey', 'tim hutten', 'john mann', and 'john smith').\n5. Compare the count of 'd' instances with other positions to determine if it has more occurrences than any other position. In this case, 'd' appears 4 times, whereas 'gk', 'cb', and 'cf' each appear only 1 time.
