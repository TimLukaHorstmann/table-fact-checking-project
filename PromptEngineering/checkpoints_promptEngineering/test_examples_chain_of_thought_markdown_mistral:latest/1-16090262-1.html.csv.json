The columns indicate various details about each episode.\n\n2. In order to check the claim, we need to find the episode number 11 and compare it with the title \"the engagement ring\".\n\n3. We start by iterating through the rows of the table (from row 1 to 12). Each row represents an episode in order of airdate within season 7.\n\n4. When we reach row 6 (episode number 148), we see that the title is \"hacking stockman\" which does not match the claim's title.\n\n5. We continue iterating through the rows and when we reach row 9 (episode number 151), we see that the title is \"web wranglers\", which again, does not match the claim's title.\n\n6. In row 10 (episode number 152), we find \"superquest\" which doesn't match either.\n\n7. Finally, in row 11 (episode number 153), we find \"city under siege\" and in row 12 (episode number 154), we find \"super power struggle\". None of these titles match the claim's title.\n\n8.
