The high point for each game in the table is listed under the \"score\" column. In this case, there isn't a \"score\" for Detroit because they lost. Instead, the score lists the points scored by the opponent (Charlotte Hornets). However, under the team column, it shows that Morris Peterson had 20 points for Detroit in this game.\n\n4. Now let's check for high rebounds for each game. In the table, the highest rebounds for each game are listed under the \"high rebounds\" column. For the May 2 game, antonio davis had 12 rebounds.\n\n5.
