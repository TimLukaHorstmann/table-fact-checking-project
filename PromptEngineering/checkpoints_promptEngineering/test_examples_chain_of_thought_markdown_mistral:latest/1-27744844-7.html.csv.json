Since no player's name is explicitly mentioned as \"the king\", we assume it refers to a key player on the team. The table shows two players with significant contributions: Tyreke Evans and Demarcus Cousins.\n\n2. Check if either of these players played against Atlanta twice and Denver twice. We will evaluate each player separately.\n\n3. For Tyreke Evans:\n   - Count the number of games against Atlanta and Denver. There are 2 games against each team (rows 32, 33 and 30, 38). However, since the row index is not unique for a specific game but represents all games in the table, we need to check the 'team' column for consistency.\n   - Check the 'team' column for all rows where the 'score' is different for both teams (indicating a match between these two teams). For Tyreke Evans, the 'team' is \"denver\" in rows 30 and 38, and \"atlanta\" in rows 32 and 35. This meets our criterion of playing against both Atlanta and Denver twice.\n\n4. For Demarcus Cousins:\n   - Count the number of games against Atlanta and Denver. There are 1 game against each team (rows 31 and 33). However, since the row index is not unique for a specific game but represents all games in the table, we need to check the 'team' column for consistency.\n   - Check the 'team' column for all rows where the 'score' is different for both teams. For Demarcus Cousins, the 'team' is \"denver\" in row 30 and \"atlanta\" in row 39. This does not meet our criterion of playing against both Atlanta and Denver twice.\n\n5.
