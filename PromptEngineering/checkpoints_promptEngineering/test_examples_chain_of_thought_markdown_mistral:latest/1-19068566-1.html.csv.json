Third, check each episode for its production code. If any episode's production code matches 3t7461, then it means that Mairzee Almas did indeed direct the episode with that production code.\n\n4. Fourth, compare the resulting episodes against the one with production code 3t7461 to verify if they match in all aspects (title, us air date, etc.).
