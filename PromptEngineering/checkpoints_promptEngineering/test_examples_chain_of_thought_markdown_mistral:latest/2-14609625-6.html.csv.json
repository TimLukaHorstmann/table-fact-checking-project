    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the players in the table.\n2. For each player, calculate their touchdown count (from the 'touchdowns' column).\n3. Filter out the players whose average yards per attempt is less than 2.6 (from the 'average' column).\n4. Check if there are any players remaining after filtering.\n5. If there are players remaining, check their touchdown count to see if it equals 1.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify players in the table\", \"Calculate touchdowns for each player\", \"Filter out players with average less than 2.6\", \"Check if any players remain after filtering\", \"If yes, check their touchdown count\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"touchdowns\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"average\"}]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation: After filtering out players with average yards per attempt less than 2.6, we are left with two players: stephen davis and skip hicks. Both of these players have a touchdown count greater than 1 (Stephen Davis has 11 and Skip Hicks has 1). Therefore, the claim is TRUE for at least one player.",
