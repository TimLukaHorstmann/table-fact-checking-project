    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, identify the series for each season prior to 2002. The relevant rows are those with year less than 2002, i.e., rows 0, 1, 2, and 3. In these rows, the \"series\" column indicates that the seasons are Formula Renault 2.0 Brazil.\n\n2. Next, filter out the rows where there is a win. To do this, check if the \"wins\" column has any non-zero values. Since all the wins in the table are zero, we can conclude that all the rows meet this condition.\n\n3. Since the conditions (series being Formula Renault 2.0 Brazil and having no wins) hold for all relevant rows, we can say that the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells:\n[\n  { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"series\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"series\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"series\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"series\" }\n]\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the series for each season prior to 2002\",\n    \"Filter out rows where there is a win\",\n    \"Compare the remaining rows with the conditions in the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"series\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"series\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"series\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"series\" }\n  ]\n}",
