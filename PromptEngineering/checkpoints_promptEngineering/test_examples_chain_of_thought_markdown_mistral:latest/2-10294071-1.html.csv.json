    "resp": "Here are the steps for solving the problem:\n\n1. Identify the player we are looking for, which is Dragutin Mitic. We can find him by checking the names of players in the table.\n2. Determine the year of his debut. In the table, the \"debut\" column shows the year he started playing. For Dragutin Mitic, it's 1936.\n3. Find out how many ties he played in that same year. The number of ties is represented by the number of rows for a given player. However, we should only focus on the ties played during his debut year. In this case, since Dragutin Mitic has 29 rows (or 29 games played), all the games are considered as relevant for the calculation of ties during his debut year in 1936.\n4. Verify whether the total number of ties played in his debut year matches the claimed number (29.0). Since Dragutin Mitic has 29 games played and each game contributes one tie, it means he has exactly 29 ties played during his debut year.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the player (Dragutin Mitic).\",\n    \"Find the year of his debut (1936).\",\n    \"Count the number of rows for the given player (29 games played).\",\n    \"Assume that all games are relevant for calculating ties during the debut year.\",\n    \"Check if the total number of ties matches the claimed number (29.0).\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total w - l\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"ties played\" }\n  ]\n}",
