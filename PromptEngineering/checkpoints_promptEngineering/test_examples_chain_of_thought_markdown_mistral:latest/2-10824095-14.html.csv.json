Each row represents a match between two teams, specifying their scores, venue, and crowd attendance.\n\n2. Search for the row containing the home team of Essendon, which we know is listed under \"home team\". In this case, it's 'essendon'.\n\n3. Check if the relevant row found in step 2 has any cells with a value related to crowd (crowd size). In this case, the fifth cell of the row (since we use zero-based indexing) contains the information about the crowd size for each match, and it has the value '47656'.\n\nBased on the table contents and our reasoning steps, here is the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check structure of table\",\n    \"Identify row with home team 'essendon'\",\n    \"Examine if that row has any cells related to crowd size\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "1. Identify the claim: The claim states that there was a crowd of 74656 for Essendon's home team on 26 June 1982.\n\n2. Check the table for relevant data: We need to find the rows where the \"home team\" is Essendon and the \"date\" matches with 26 June 1982.\n\n3. Find the corresponding row: After searching the table, we see that there is only one row (row index 5) that meets our criteria - home team as Essendon and date as 26 June 1982.\n\n4. Check the \"crowd\" column in the found row: In this row, under the \"crowd\" column, we find the number of spectators for the Essendon game on 26 June 1982.\n\n5. Compare the found value with the claim: The value in the \"crowd\" column for Essendon's home team on 26 June 1982 is 47656, which does not match the claimed number of 74656 spectators.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim and its components\",\n    \"Find the relevant rows in the table based on the provided information\",\n    \"Check the 'crowd' column for the found row\",\n    \"Compare the found value with the claimed number\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
