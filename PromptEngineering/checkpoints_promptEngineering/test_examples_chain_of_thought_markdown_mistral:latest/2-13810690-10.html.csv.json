    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. The claim states that during only 2 games, either team held to zero points. This implies that there are exactly two games where neither team scored any runs (0-0).\n\n2. We need to examine each game in the table and compare the 'score' column for matches with a score of 0-0.\n\n3. To find relevant rows, we search for instances where both teams have scores less than 1, which would mean they scored 0 points.\n\n4. In the provided table, there are two instances where neither team scored:\n   - Row index 5 (september 5): opponent = mets, score = 3-0, which means the Phillies did not score a point in this game. However, the Philles were the home team, so it's not clear whether they should be considered as the \"other team\" that didn't score or not.\n   - Row index 6 (september 6): opponent = postponed due to weather, score = postponed due to weather, which doesn't provide information about scores for either team. So this game is not relevant.\n   - Row index 7 (september 2): opponent = nationals, score = 8-4. This means that the Phillies did score points in this game and are therefore not the \"other team\" that didn't score.\n\n5.
