Check for matches played at home - In the table, there are 6 rows representing matches. Out of these 6 rows, 3 rows have \"h\" in the 'h/a' column indicating a home game for Manchester United:\n   - Row index 1 (first knockout round second leg vs Internazionale)\n   - Row index 4 (quarter-final first leg vs Porto)\n   - Row index 6 (semi-final first leg vs Arsenal)\n\n3. Count the number of home games - There are 3 rows representing home games, as identified in step 2.\n\n4.
