    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "Here are the steps to reason through the claim:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the players who were selected in the 4th round of the draft. The rows with a pick number greater than or equal to 100 and less than 145 (since the rounds have 16 picks each) are potential candidates. In this table, rows 4, 5, and 7 meet these criteria.\n\n2. Next, we need to find out which of these players are from Michigan. We can identify a player as being from Michigan if their school / club team is \"michigan\". Only row 2, with Todd Collins, satisfies this condition.\n\n3. Lastly, compare the two players that meet our conditions (from round 4 and from Michigan) to see if they are the same. In this case, Todd Collins is the only player in both sets of criteria.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify players selected in the 4th round by checking pick numbers (rows 4, 5, and 7)\",\n    \"Filter these players to find those from Michigan (player's school / club team is 'michigan')\",\n    \"Compare the remaining players to see if there are any that meet both criteria\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
