We then look for the player that was picked in round 20, as stated in the claim. In our table, there is no player with a row index of 20.\n3. Next, we check if there are any players in subsequent rounds who were not listed because they were already removed from the table (e.g., due to reaching maximum picks for each round or an error). However, since the table only lists 21 players and no player was picked in round 20, it is unlikely that another player was missed.\n4. Finally, we compare this observation with the claim.
