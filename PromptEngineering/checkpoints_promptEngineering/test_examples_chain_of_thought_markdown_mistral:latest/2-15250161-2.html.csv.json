Since the table shows data for 'team' 'suzuki', it implies that Mitsuo Itoh competed for Suzuki team.\n\n2. We next determine the years between 1961 and 1967 where he competes. To do this, we look for non-zero values in the 'points' column. If there is no value, it indicates that Mitsuo Itoh didn't compete in that year.\n\n3. We find that Mitsuo Itoh competed in 1962 (both 50cc and 125cc), 1963 (50cc and 125cc), 1964 (both 50cc and 125cc), and 1966 (both 50cc and 125cc).\n\n4. We notice that he didn't compete in 1961, 1965, and 1967 from the table data. However, the claim mentions that he competed only once in these years.\n\n5. To determine if it's true that Mitsuo Itoh competed only once in those years, we check for the year-wise competition count by adding up the number of competitions per year for Mitsuo Itoh:\n   - In 1965: No points means no competition, so only one time.\n   - In 1967: No points means no competition, so only one time.\n\n6.

In 1967, Suzuki won one race in the 50cc class and one in the 125cc class (according to the 'wins' column).\n\n4.
