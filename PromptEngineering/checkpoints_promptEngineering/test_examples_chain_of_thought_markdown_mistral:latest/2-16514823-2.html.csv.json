    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to determine whether there exists a row in the table where both the date and opponents match the given claim (September 19th, 2015 and g\u00f6teborg). The date is not provided in the given format, but it can be seen that it follows the 'YYYY - MM - DD' pattern.\n\n2. We iterate through each row of the table to find a match for the opponent (g\u00f6teborg) and date (September 19th, 2015). In this case, we do not find such a match in the given table.\n\n3. Since we could not find any instance where g\u00f6teborg played on September 19th, 2015 according to the provided data, we conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check if the given date and opponent exist in the table\",\n    \"Iterate through each row to find a match for the opponent (g\u00f6teborg) and date (September 19th, 2015)\",\n    \"Since we did not find such a match, conclude that the claim is FALSE\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
