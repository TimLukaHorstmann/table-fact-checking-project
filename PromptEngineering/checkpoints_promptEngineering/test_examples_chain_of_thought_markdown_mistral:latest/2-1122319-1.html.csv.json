    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, scan the table to identify rows where the number of laps (`laps`) is 105, as that's the condition mentioned in the claim. In this table, only two drivers have completed 105 laps - lorenzo bandini (row 1) and richie ginther (row 2).\n\n2. Next, check if the time/retired column (`time / retired`) for these rows matches the value mentioned in the claim (+6.18). In the table, lorenzo bandini has a time of 2:06:18.23 and richie ginther's time is not explicitly given, but it indicates retirement with a '+' sign. However, the + sign followed by a number in this table represents additional laps completed rather than a time difference. Since we don't have any information about ginther's additional laps, we cannot confirm if both drivers meet the condition mentioned in the claim.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows where the number of laps is 105.\",\n    \"Check if the time/retired for these rows matches the value mentioned in the claim (+6.18).\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\" }\n  ]\n}",
