    "resp": "Here is my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, I will examine the table to find rows (nations) where the silver medal count equals 1 and the gold and bronze counts are 0. This condition represents countries that scored only one silver medal according to the claim.\n2. Since we are looking for a match with the conditions specified in the claim, I will focus on examining the \"silver\" and \"total\" columns because they directly relate to the number of silver medals a nation has won and the total number of medals it has won overall.\n3. By scanning the table from top to bottom, I find the row that meets the specified condition: \"ireland\" with 1 silver medal and 1 total medal. This indicates that Ireland has only scored one silver medal and no other medals as claimed.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Examine table to find rows where silver count equals 1 and gold and bronze counts are 0\", \"Focus on 'silver' and 'total' columns because they directly relate to the number of silver medals a nation has won and the total number of medals it has won overall\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 25,\n      \"column_name\": \"silver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 25,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
