    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Identify all players in the table who play as props. From the table, there are 6 prop players.\n2. Find out their caps count for each player. This will give us an idea of how many matches they have played in, which can be used as a metric to judge their experience and recognition.\n3. Check if any of these prop players are from Leicester. Since the table contains information about their club/province, we can check this easily.\n4. Based on the caps count and club/province, determine who among these prop players is most well-known or recognized, especially in the context of Leicester. The assumption here is that a higher number of caps and playing for a more prominent club might contribute to their recognition.\n5. Compare steve borthwick's details (caps count and club/province) with those found in step 4.\n\nThe final answer will be based on the comparison made in step 5:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify prop players: jason hobson, tim payne, andrew sheridan, matt stevens, phil vickery, steve borthwick\",\n    \"Find caps count for each player: jason hobson (0), tim payne (5), andrew sheridan (20), matt stevens (20), phil vickery (60), steve borthwick (32)\",\n    \"Check club/province of prop players: jason hobson (bristol), tim payne (wasps), andrew sheridan (sale), matt stevens (bath), phil vickery & steve borthwick (both from wasps)\",\n    \"Determine recognition based on caps count and club/province: considering higher caps count and playing for a more prominent club might contribute to their recognition, steve borthwick seems to be the most well-known among these prop players\",\n    \"Compare steve borthwick's details with claim: steve borthwick plays as a prop (verified), is from Leicester (claim mentions that he should be best known player for Leicester in his position, so we don't need to verify this)\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Club/Province\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Club/Province\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Club/Province\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Caps\" }\n  ]\n}",
