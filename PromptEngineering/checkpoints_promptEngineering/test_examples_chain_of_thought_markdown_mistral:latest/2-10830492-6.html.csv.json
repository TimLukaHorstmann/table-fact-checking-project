We can see that only one player (ayoub pourtaghi) made it to the final round according to the \"final\" column.\n2. Since there are 12 athletes listed in the table, half of them would be 6 athletes if all 12 athletes were able to advance through each round. However, since only one athlete advanced to the final round, it means that at most one-sixth (or 2 athletes) could have possibly made it to the final round.\n3. We then count how many players are left after the semifinals and found that there are no athletes listed in the \"final\" column for any row other than ayoub pourtaghi. Since the number of athletes remaining after semifinals is equal to the number who made it to the final round (1), it means that none of the 11 remaining athletes (other than ayoub) advanced past the semifinals.\n4. We now focus on the semifinal round and count how many athletes are listed in this column with \"did not advance\" as their result. In our table, all but one athlete (ayoub pourtaghi) have \"did not advance\". Since there are 11 athletes who did not advance to the final from the semifinals, it means that all of them (11 out of 12 athletes) also did not advance past the quarterfinals.\n5. We now count how many athletes are listed as having advanced from the quarterfinals based on their results in that column. In our table, only one athlete (ayoub pourtaghi) is listed as having advanced to the semifinals from the quarterfinals.\n6. Since all but one athlete did not advance past the quarterfinals and there were 12 athletes in total, it means that 11 athletes did not make it past the quarterfinals (the remaining athlete was ayoub pourtaghi).\n7. Comparing the number of athletes who advanced to the semifinals with the number of athletes who should have advanced if half of them made it through each round (half of 12 is 6), we see that only one athlete actually made it, which is less than what would be expected if half of the players made it through.\n8.
