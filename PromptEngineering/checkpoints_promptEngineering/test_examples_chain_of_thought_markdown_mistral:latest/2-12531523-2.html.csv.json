Locate the row corresponding to Tom Watson in the table. In this case, it's the 4th row with \"tom watson\" as the first column value.\n3. Check the \"total\" column for the value of Tom Watson's wins. The value for Tom Watson is 150 in the fourth row.\n4. Compare the given claim (Tom Watson's win total from 1976) with the obtained value from step 3. The claim specifies 1976 as the year, but we need to find out if Tom Watson won in 1976 or not.\n5. Since we don't have the year-wise wins for each player, we cannot confirm whether Tom Watson won in 1976 based on the provided table alone. However, we can say that the total number of wins for Tom Watson is 150 according to the table. So, we cannot verify the given claim (Tom Watson's win total from 1976) because there isn't enough information in the table to check whether he won in 1976 or not.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify player (Tom Watson), locate his row, find total wins, compare given claim with obtained value\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
