Identify the value we are looking for, which is a player with a \"pf\" (percentage of shots made) of 67 when their \"ends lost\" (number of ends they have lost) is equal to 40.\n   2. Scan through the table to find the rows where \"pf\" equals approximately 67 (since it's not an exact number, we'll look for values close to this). There are no such entries found after an initial scan.\n   3. Since we didn't find any exact match for the given condition, we compare the values of players whose pf is closer to 67 and \"ends lost\" is equal to or near 40.\n   4. We find the player \"deane horning\" from British Columbia with a \"pf\" of 72 and \"ends lost\" of 45. This value is quite close to our target condition.\n   5. The other players whose \"pf\" is relatively close to 67 and \"ends lost\" is near or equal to 40 are as follows:\n      - Rod Macdonald from Prince Edward Island with a \"pf\" of 67 and \"ends lost\" of 51 (above our target, but the closest so far)\n      - Mike Jakubo from Northern Ontario with a \"pf\" of 64 and \"ends lost\" of 48\n   6. Since Rod Macdonald's \"ends lost\" is closer to our target than Deane Horning's, we compare them further:\n      - We find that Rod Macdonald's \"ends won\" (41) plus his \"blanks ends\" (12) add up to 53, which is less than our target of 40.\n      - On the other hand, Deane Horning's \"ends won\" (47) plus his \"blanks ends\" (18) add up to 65, which is greater than our target of 40 but still closer compared to Rod Macdonald.\n   7.
