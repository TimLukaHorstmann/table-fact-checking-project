The table contains columns for 'inegi code', 'municipality', 'municipal seat', 'population (2010)', and 'area (km2)'.\n2. Next, identify the row that corresponds to 'mexicali' based on the municipality column. In this case, the row index is 2.\n3. Then, check the value of the 'inegi code' for the selected row. The inegi code for mexicali is given in the second column of the selected row.\n4. Check if the value of the 'area (km2)' for the same row matches the claimed area of 12,700 km. In this case, the actual area for mexicali according to the table is 13700 km2.\n5. Compare the inegi code and the area given in the claim with the values found from the table.\n\nThe answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Read and understand the table structure\",\n    \"Find the row for 'mexicali'\",\n    \"Check the value of 'inegi code' for the selected row\",\n    \"Check if the value of 'area (km2)' matches the claimed area\",\n    \"Compare both values with the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"inegi code\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"area (km2)\" }\n  ]\n}",
