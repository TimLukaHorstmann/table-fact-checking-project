    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. First, we examine the column 'home' from each row in the table to find out who was playing at home.\n2. We then compare this information with the claim that \"the game on march 8 be play by minnesota (home) and philadelphia (visitor)\".\n3. In the given table, we see that only one row corresponds to the date 'march 8'. From the 'home' column in that row, we observe that the team playing at home was 'minnesota'.\n4. Furthermore, from the 'visitor' column in the same row, we observe that the team visiting was 'philadelphia'.\n5. Comparing this with the claim, we see that both teams mentioned in the claim ('minnesota' and 'philadelphia') correspond to the home and visitor teams as given in the table for the date 'march 8'.\n6. Therefore, the game on march 8 was indeed played by minnesota (home) and philadelphia (visitor).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Examine the column 'home' from each row to find out who was playing at home.\",\n    \"Compare this information with the claim that 'the game on march 8 be play by minnesota (home) and philadelphia (visitor)'\",\n    \"Observe if both teams mentioned in the claim correspond to the home and visitor teams as given in the table for the date 'march 8'\",\n    \"Compare the information from the table with the claim.\",\n    \"Find that both teams match, indicating that the game on march 8 was played by minnesota (home) and philadelphia (visitor)\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"home\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"visitor\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
