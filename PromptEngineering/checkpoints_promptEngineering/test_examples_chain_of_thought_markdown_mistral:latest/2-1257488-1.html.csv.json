Locate the rows in the table that correspond to matches played on January 26, 2006. There's only one such row (row number 8).\n3. Examine the \"result\" column for this row. If the value is 2 - 1, then the claim is true.\n4. Check the \"result\" column for row 8: The value is indeed 2 - 1.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Locate rows matching the date in the claim\",\n    \"Check the 'result' column for these rows\",\n    \"Verify that the value matches the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
