From the table, there are no rows explicitly stating the team's name. However, we can infer that the 6th row with \"ottawa 67 's\" under \"club team\" is a reasonable match for Ottawa Senators since this is the only entry with an abbreviated version of the team name (67 stands for 1967, which was the year of their founding).\n2. Check the nationality of players in the Ottawa Senators row (row 6). The player's nationality is not explicitly stated in this particular row; however, we can see that Corey Cowick, who has 160 points overall, is from Canada.\n3. Consider whether there might be other draft picks by Ottawa Senators in the table. Since the table is sorted by round and overall points, it is possible that players with lower points were drafted before Cowick and are not included in this table. However, since we have no way of knowing whether any missing players are American or non-American, we cannot definitively conclude anything about the other potential picks.\n4.

One early round (2) and one late round (7).\n   - For Fr\u00f6lunda HC (Gothenburg) (sweden), there are two picks (rows 2 and 4).
