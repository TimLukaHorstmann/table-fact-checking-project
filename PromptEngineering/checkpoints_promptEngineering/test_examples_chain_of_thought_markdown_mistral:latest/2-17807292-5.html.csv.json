The score for a player is calculated by adding up the values under the \"score\" column. For example, Sergio Garcia's score is 69 + 73 + 69 = 211.\n3. Compare their scores:\n   - Sergio Garc\u00eda: 211\n   - P\u00e1draig Harrington: 211\n   - Charlie Wi: 211 (note that his score is not fully provided in the table; however, since all other players have a complete score and they are tied with him at +1 to par, it's reasonable to assume that he also has a total score of 211)\n4. Find their \"to par\" values: subtract the total scores from the number 200 (since the table indicates that this is the par for the tournament). For example, Sergio Garcia's \"to par\" value is 200 - 211 = -1.\n5. Compare their \"to par\" values:\n   - Sergio Garc\u00eda: -1\n   - P\u00e1draig Harrington: -1\n   - Charlie Wi (assumed to be -1 as well, given the information in the table)\n6.
