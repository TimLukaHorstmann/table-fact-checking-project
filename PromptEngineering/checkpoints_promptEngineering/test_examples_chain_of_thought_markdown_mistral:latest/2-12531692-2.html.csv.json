Identify the players that make up the 4th player ('no8'): m\u00e1rio telmo (Row 3, Column 'no8') and celia telmo (Row 3, Column 'no7').\n3. Check if Susana z\u00e9 Maria plays on the same team as m\u00e1rio telmo and celia telmo: By comparing the teams of these players across different days in the table, we find that they are always grouped together on the same team. However, it is important to note that the specific team names (e.g., 'telmo c\u00e9lia') do not appear until later in the table (Day 120).\n4. Identify the players that make up the 5th player ('no9'): C\u00e9lia susana (Row 2, Column 'no9').\n5. Check if Susana z\u00e9 Maria plays on the same team as C\u00e9lia susana: Similarly, by comparing their teams across different days in the table, we find that they are also always grouped together on the same team. Again, the specific team names do not appear until later in the table (Day 120).\n6. Combine the results from steps 3 and 5: Susana z\u00e9 Maria plays on the same team as m\u00e1rio telmo and celia telmo (the 4th player) AND Susana z\u00e9 Maria plays on the same team as C\u00e9lia susana (the 5th player).\n\n   Here's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify players 'susana z\u00e9 maria' and 'no8' (4th player) teams.\",\n    \"Compare their team compositions across different days to ensure consistency.\",\n    \"Repeat for the 5th player ('no9')\",\n    \"Combine results to check if they play on the same team.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"no7\" }, // celia telmo (4th player)\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"no8\" }, // m\u00e1rio telmo (4th player)\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"no9\" } // C\u00e9lia susana (5th player)\n  ]\n}",

Find out who 'no6' plays. We look for 'no6' in the table and find it on the 4th row where it is associated with 'celia paulo'.\n\n3. Now, we check if 'richardo v' (who was initially part of 'c\u00e9lia telmo') played against 'paulo' (associated with 'no6').

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify who telmo and paulo are from the table, as they have unique names. Telmo can be found in rows 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, and Pablo (Paulo) can be found in rows 4, 6, 8, and 10.\n2. From the table, we see that telmo and paulo have a common \"no\" number with neither of them, meaning they do not share any numbers with each other within the same row or column.\n3. Now, let's consider if telmo and paulo could be on the same team based on who they are associated with in the \"intruder\", \"nominated\", or \"evicted\" columns. However, these columns do not provide any clear connections between telmo and paulo as they are not directly related (e.g., one is an intruder, while the other is evicted on the same day).\n4. There are two possible connections: no6 and no9. But since neither telmo nor pablo share a common \"no\" number with either of them, we cannot confirm that they play on the same team as no6 or no9.\n5. After examining all possible connections within the given table, we cannot confirm that telmo and paulo are on the same team as no6 and no9.\n\nFinally, here's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify Telmo and Pablo in the table\",\n    \"Check if they share any common 'no' numbers within the same row or column\",\n    \"Examine possible connections through 'intruder', 'nominated', or 'evicted' columns\",\n    \"Check if Telmo and Pablo are on the same team based on their connections with no6 and no9\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"no\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"no\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"no\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"no\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"no\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"no\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"no\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"no\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"no\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"no\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"intruder\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"intruder\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"intruder\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"nominated\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"evicted\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"evicted\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"no6\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"no9\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"no9\" }\n  ]\n}",
