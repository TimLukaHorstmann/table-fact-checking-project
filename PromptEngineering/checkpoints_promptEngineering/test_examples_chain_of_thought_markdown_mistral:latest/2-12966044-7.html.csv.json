    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the conditions required to verify the claim:\n    - The date should be in September 2000. (We can check the \"date\" column)\n    - The crowd attendance should be 22506. (We can check the \"attendance\" column)\n    - The group position should be 3rd. (We can check the \"group position\" column)\n\n2. Loop through the table row by row and compare the values against the conditions.\n\nMy final answer is in the following JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the conditions required to verify the claim\",\n    \"Check the 'date' column for a match with September 2000\",\n    \"Check the 'attendance' column for a match with 22506\",\n    \"Check the 'group position' column for a match with 3rd\",\n    \"Loop through the table row by row and compare values against conditions\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"group position\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn the table provided, there is no match for the conditions specified in the claim. The row with the closest matching values (18 October 2000, attendance of 66313, and group position as 1st) does not have a date in September 2000 nor an attendance of 22506.",
