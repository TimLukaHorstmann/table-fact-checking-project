Identify this team's record before the second loss by looking at the \"record\" column for the first loss (row 6), which shows a record of 2 - 4.\n  3.

Check the record for each row - The record is indicated by the last column of the table (column 'record').

In this case, we find that the sum of '2 - 4', '7 - 8', and '7 - 9' equals '16 - 21'.\n5.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the team from the claim: The team is not explicitly mentioned in the table, but it can be inferred that it should be the same as the one associated with row 6 (orlando).\n\n2. Find the record of the team against Orlando: To do this, we will look for rows where the \"location\" column mentions Orlando and compare their records (the \"record\" column) to find if they have a 7-8 record against Orlando.\n\n3. Check the relevant row(s): In our case, there is only one row that matches the criteria: row_index=6, column_name=\"location\" contains 'orlando' and row_index=6, column_name=\"record\" contains '2 - 4'.\n\n4.
