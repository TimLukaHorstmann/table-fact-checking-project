There's no tournament or date matching these details in the table.\n2. The claim mentions a location (Auckland) but it doesn't specify if it should be the same as any existing tournament location in the table. Since there's no information suggesting this, we can assume that the claim is about the same tournament location as mentioned in the table.\n3. Check for the surface of the tournament at the specified date: \"October 10, 2004\". In the table, there's no row with a matching date. Therefore, we cannot find the playing surface for that specific date.\n4. However, since the claim does not specify any other tournament, and since it is reasonable to assume that if a tournament at Auckland occurred on October 10, 2004, it would be in the table (assuming the table contains all relevant tournaments), we can infer that there was no tournament at Auckland on October 10, 2004 according to the given table.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify tournament and date from claim\",\n    \"Check if the specified date exists in the table\",\n    \"Since the table contains all relevant tournaments (according to assumption), infer that there was no tournament at Auckland on October 10, 2004 according to the given table\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
