Then, I identified the row where the player's name was \"boo weekley\". In this table, row 10 contains his name.\n3. Next, I compared the score in row 10 (which is 67 + 72 + 72 = 211) with the scores of other players in the table to see if any player had a lower score.\n4. After checking all the rows, I found that no player had a lower score than \"boo weekley\".\n5. Since the claim states that \"boo weekley\" has a score of 211 and is in t10 place, I compared this with my findings from steps 3 and 4.\n6. The comparison confirms that \"boo weekley\" does indeed have a score of 211 and is in t10 place as stated in the table.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find the row containing 'boo weekley', compare his score with others, check if any player has a lower score, compare the positions of 'boo weekley' and the claim.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}",

In this case, his score (210) is identical to that of Bryce Molder and Thongchai Jaidee, who are both listed as t8.\n3. Determine if Bryce Molder's score is correct relative to par. To do this, we need to find the value in the \"to par\" column for Bryce Molder's row. However, the table does not provide this information for all players. Instead, it shows the number of strokes over/under par based on the final total of each player (e.g., +1 for \u00c1ngel Cabrera and Richard S Johnson).\n4. Since there is no \"to par\" value provided in the table for Bryce Molder, we cannot definitively say whether he is at par, above or below par.
