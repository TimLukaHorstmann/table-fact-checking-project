    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, compare the artist's name mentioned in the claim (\"maggie toal\") with the artists listed in the table.\n2. Second, check if there exists a row in the table where the \"artist\" column matches \"maggie toal\".\n3. Third, for that specific row found in step 2, find the cell in the \"song\" column and compare its value with the song mentioned in the claim (\"feed him with love\").\n4. Fourth, check if the numerical value in the corresponding cell of the \"points\" column of the same row matches the number of points given in the claim (no specific points were given in the claim).\n5. Fifth, find the cell in the \"place\" column for that same row and compare its position relative to other rows to see if it corresponds with the 7th place as mentioned in the claim.\n6. Sixth, compare the position of the cell in the \"place\" column with the number 7. If the two are equal or greater than 7 (indicating a lower rank), then the artist maggie toal does not have a draw of 7 for the song feed him with love.\n\nThe final answer can be found by comparing the position of the cell in the \"place\" column with the number 7:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Compare artist's name with those listed in the table\",\n    \"Find the row where the 'artist' matches the given name\",\n    \"Check the song mentioned in the claim with the song listed for that row\",\n    \"Ignore the points since no specific points were given in the claim\",\n    \"Compare the position of the cell in the 'place' column with 7\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"place\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
