    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the team referred to in the claim, which is the Evansville Triplets. In the table, look for a row with 'team' equal to 'evansville triplets'. No such row exists, but the closest match would be 'evansville triplets' from the 12th row, which is in the American Association league and not the Three-I League mentioned in the claim.\n\n2. Since the Evansville Triplets do not appear anywhere in the table as a member of the Three-I League, it is highly unlikely that they would have won championships in the specified years (1946, 1948, 1956, 1957) within this league.\n\n3. If the team was indeed in the Three-I League and won those titles, there would be a row in the table with 'team' equal to 'evansville triplets', 'league' equal to 'three - i league', and at least one of the years (1946, 1948, 1956, 1957) under the 'championships' column.\n\nThe claim is not supported by the provided data as there is no row that matches both the team and league specified in the claim.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Check for existence of Evansville Triplets in the table, verify if they are in Three-I League according to the claim, and look for championships during the specified years\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"league\" }, // The row closest matching the team 'evansville triplets'\n    // No relevant cell found as the Evansville Triplets do not appear in any Three-I League championship years.\n  ]\n}",
