Compare the 'name' column values provided (curtis brinkley and doug hogue) with the names in the table to verify if they exist. curtis brinkley and doug hogue are present in the table.\n2. For each player, find their respective average per game (avg / g). To do this, look for rows with matching 'name' values and sum the gain and loss columns, then divide by the number of games played (gp).\n   - For curtis brinkley: sum(gain) = 1193, sum(loss) = 29, gp = 12, so avg / g = 1193 + 29 / 12 = 97.0\n   - For doug hogue: sum(gain) = 232, sum(loss) = 0, gp = 11, so avg / g = 232 + 0 / 11 = 21.1\n3. Compare the 'long' column values provided (45 for curtis brinkley and 82 for doug hogue) with the corresponding long values in the table. The values match for each player:\n   - For curtis brinkley, the row matches with long = 45\n   - For doug hogue, the row matches with long = 82\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that curtis brinkley have an avg / g of 97.0 and doug hogue have an avg / g of 21.1 with a long of 45 and 82, which is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Compare 'name' values provided (curtis brinkley and doug hogue) with the names in the table to verify if they exist.\",\n    \"For each player, find their respective average per game (avg / g).\",\n    \"Compare the 'long' column values provided (45 for curtis brinkley and 82 for doug hogue) with the corresponding long values in the table.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"avg / g\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"long\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"avg / g\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"long\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
