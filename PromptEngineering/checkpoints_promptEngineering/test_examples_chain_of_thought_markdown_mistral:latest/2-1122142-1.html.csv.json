    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we identify the driver for whom we are verifying the claim: Cesare Perdisa.\n2. Next, we find the row corresponding to this driver in the table. The table includes columns for Driver, Constructor, Laps, Time / Retired, Grid.\n3. We compare the \"Retired\" value in the row with \"Cesare Perdisa\" with the given claim: \"+ 6 laps\".\n4. We find that the value for Cesare Perdisa is indeed \"+ 6 laps\", which matches the given claim.\n5. However, we also need to verify if the grid position (Grid column) in the table matches the one mentioned in the claim (18).\n6. We find that the grid position for Cesare Perdisa in the table is not specified. The given claim does not specify the constructor for Cesare Perdisa, but the table shows Maserati as his constructor. Since we cannot confirm the grid position without this information, we cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim.\n\nTherefore, our answer will be:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify driver\", \"Find row of driver in table\", \"Compare 'Retired' value with given claim\", \"Check if grid position matches claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"Partial Answer\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Retired\"}]\n}",
