    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning:\n\n1. First, I identify the row corresponding to 2012 in the table. In this case, it's the third row (since the year increases from left to right).\n\n2. Then, I look at the columns of interest specified in the claim: \"annual ridership\", \"rider per mile\", and \"stations\".\n\n3. In the third row, the values for these columns are 2.31154e+08 (which corresponds to 2,311,540,000 when converted from scientific notation), 7095, and 145 respectively.\n\n4. Lastly, I compare these values with the values given in the claim: 123219300, 4056, and 44 respectively.\n\nThe annual ridership (2.31154e+08) does not match the value specified in the claim (123219300), so the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the row corresponding to 2012, compare the values for annual ridership, rider per mile, and stations with those given in the claim.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"annual ridership\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"rider per mile\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"stations\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n1. First, we need to identify the lines (columns) from the table where the number of riders per mile exceeds 10,000.\n2. We can start by looking at the \"lines\" column to find rows that have more than one line (i.e., lines with indices greater than 1). This is because we assume that each line has its own unique set of stations and ridership data.\n3. From the table, we see that there are 5 lines, so we examine each line's ridership per mile data in the \"rider per mile\" column.\n4. By checking the values in the \"rider per mile\" column for each line, we find the following lines with more than 10,000 riders per mile:\n   - Line index 3 (row 6) has a rider per mile of 18,123\n   - Line index 7 (row 9) has a rider per mile of 4594\n   - Line index 11 (row 12) has a rider per mile of 9172\n   - Line index 13 (row 13) has a rider per mile of 18,123\n   - Line index 16 (row 14) has a rider per mile of 9115\n\n5. Since we have found five lines with ridership per mile exceeding 10,000, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the relevant columns: annual ridership (2012), rider per mile, opened, stations, lines\",\n    \"Focus on the lines column to find rows with more than one line\",\n    \"Examine each line's ridership per mile data in the 'rider per mile' column\",\n    \"Check if we can find at least five lines with ridership per mile exceeding 10,000\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"rider per mile\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"rider per mile\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"rider per mile\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"rider per mile\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"rider per mile\" }\n  ]\n}",
