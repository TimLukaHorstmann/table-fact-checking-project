In this case, only one row matches this condition, which is for 'central tablelands'.\n2. Next, check if the on-air date for this matching row is before 30 December 1989. In this case, the on-air date for central tablelands is indeed 30 December 1989.\n3. Finally, compare the transmitter location for the 'central tablelands' row with the one that has been claimed in the question (mount canobolas). In this case, the transmitter location for central tablelands is mount canobolas.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the row(s) with digital power of 570 kw and check on-air date, Compare the transmitter location with the one in the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"digital power\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"on - air date\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"transmitter location\"}]\n}",

Look for the row of the table that corresponds to the identified region. In this case, it would be the second row as the table headers are not counted.\n3. Check the CH 1 value of the row we found. In the Central Tablelands row, CH 1 is \"39 ( uhf )\".\n4. Confirm if the on-air date for CH 1 in the identified region is after 30 December 1989. In the Central Tablelands row, the on-air date for CH 1 is \"30 december 1989\", which is not strictly after the required date.
