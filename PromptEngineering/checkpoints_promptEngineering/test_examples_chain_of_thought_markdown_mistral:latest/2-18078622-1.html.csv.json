The first two entries have a year of 1977 and 1991, while the third one has a year of 1977, but it also includes both cd and lp format with a specific catalog number (cd: 88697339322 lp : suz5212.1).\n3. Since the table only contains information about vinyl (lp) and CD releases for all other albums, we can infer that the entry with both cd and lp format might be a re-release or a special edition.\n4. Check if there's any information about the record label for this album. The relevant cell is \"catalog\", but it doesn't provide us with the record label information.\n5. However, we do know that the album was released in 2008 according to its format (cd: 88697339322 lp : suz5212.1). This is important because it tells us about a later release, which could be a re-issue or re-mastered version.\n6. The claim states that \"dennis wilson's pacific ocean blue be the latest re - release from caribou record\". Since we don't have information in this table about the record label for this album, we can't confirm whether it was released by Caribou Records or not.

However, since 'ca' typically represents an album released in the United States and without specific information suggesting otherwise, it's reasonable to assume that this album was released before or at the same time as albums from the US in our table.\n4. For \"la (light album)\", the year is 1979 for the first instance and 1989 for the second instance. Since 'ca' is assumed to be from the United States, we can compare only the years with definitive numbers, which are 1979 and 1989.\n5.
