Look for rows where the column 'winning driver' matches the column 'fastest lap' driver (ignoring cases where both are the same driver).\n3. In this table, there are no such instances.\n4. Therefore, none of the drivers have both the fastest lap and won the race, except for themselves (as in the case of John Surtees at Belgian Grand Prix).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Examine the table to identify drivers who have both the fastest lap and won a race.\", \"Look for rows where the 'winning driver' matches the 'fastest lap' driver (ignoring cases where both are the same driver).\", \"In this table, there are no such instances.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\"}\n  ]\n}",
