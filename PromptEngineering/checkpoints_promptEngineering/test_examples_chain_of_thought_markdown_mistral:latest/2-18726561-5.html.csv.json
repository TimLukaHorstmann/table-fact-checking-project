All rows except the first one (row_index: 0) have dates after 14 February 1976 (row_index: [1-8, 10]). The game on row_index: 0 took place on 14 February 1976, so it meets the condition.\n2. Check each row to verify if there are any ties higher than 8 or below 1. Since all games have score values greater than 1 and less than 9 (since a tie is represented by two numbers, and the minimum value for a valid tie is 1-1), the claim that there be never a tie higher than 8 or below 1 is satisfied.\n3.

Neither of these teams has a match on the given date (18 February 1976).\n3.

Identify the key elements of the claim: The claim states that all games take place on or before 14th February 1976, or after that date and every game should be a tie between the 7th and the 1st game (inclusive).\n\n2. Examine the table structure: The table has two teams per row, a score for each team, a match number, and a date.\n\n3. Determine if all matches are before or after 14th February 1976: Look at the \"date\" column to verify the dates of the games. All the matches in the table occur either on 14th February 1976 or earlier (the first replay and subsequent replays have the same date as their initial match). No matches are after 14th February 1976 according to the provided table.\n\n4. Check if every game is a tie between the 7th and the 1st game: The \"score\" column shows results for each team in each match. According to the claim, we expect every score to be either a draw (tie) or a result between the 7th and 1st games (inclusive). Analyze the scores for each match, starting from the first one.\n- The first game, Leicester City vs Manchester United, is not a tie (1 - 2). Thus, it does not meet the condition of being a tie between the 7th and the 1st games.\n- The second game, Bolton Wanderers vs Newcastle United, is also not a tie (3 - 3). It does not meet the condition of being a tie between the 7th and the 1st games.\n- The third replay, which is considered as a separate game, Bolton Wanderers vs Newcastle United again, is not a tie (1 - 2). It does not meet the condition of being a tie between the 7th and the 1st games.\n- The fourth game, Wolverhampton Wanderers vs Charlton Athletic, is a win for one team (3 - 0), so it does not meet the condition of being a tie between the 7th and the 1st games.\n- The fifth game, West Bromwich Albion vs Southampton, is a draw (1 - 1). However, this match is not among the ones specified in the claim (between the 7th and the 1st games).\n- The sixth game, Derby County vs Southend United, is a win for one team (1 - 0), so it does not meet the condition of being a tie between the 7th and the 1st games.\n- The seventh game, Norwich City vs Bradford City, is not a tie (1 - 2). It does not meet the condition of being a tie between the 7th and the 1st games.\n- The eighth game, Chelsea vs Crystal Palace, is not a tie (2 - 3). It does not meet the condition of being a tie between the 7th and the 1st games.\n- The ninth game, Stoke City vs Sunderland, is a draw (0 - 0), but it is not among the ones specified in the claim (between the 7th and the 1st games).\n- The tenth game, Sunderland vs Stoke City (replay), is a win for one team (2 - 1), so it does not meet the condition of being a tie between the 7th and the 1st games.\n\n5.
