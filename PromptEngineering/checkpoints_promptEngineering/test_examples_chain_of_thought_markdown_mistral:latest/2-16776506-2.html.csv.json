These are: 'opponent in final', 'date', 'location' and 'surface'.\n   2. Next, scan through the table row by row to find a match for the date, location, and opponent specified in the claim. The relevant rows have the same values for these columns as the ones in the claim.\n   3. The first row where all three of those columns match is the 4th row (index starts at 0). The opponent in this row is 'mirielle dittmann', the date is '6 february 2000', the location is 'wellington new zealand', and the surface is 'hard'.\n   4.
