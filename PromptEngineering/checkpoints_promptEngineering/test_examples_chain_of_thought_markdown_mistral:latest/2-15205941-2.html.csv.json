    "resp": "Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n1. Compare the ranks of Ernst Happel and Helenio Herrera in the table. They both have a rank of 4.\n2. Since they share the same rank, we cannot determine which one is higher based solely on the information given in the table about their ranks.\n3. However, to check if there is any additional information that could help us resolve this claim, let's look at other relevant columns such as number of years won and clubs won by each manager.\n4. Comparing the number of years won, Helenio Herrera won in 1964 and 1965 while Ernst Happel won in 1970 and 1983. Since 1983 is later than 1965, we can say that Ernst Happel has a later winning year than Helenio Herrera.\n5. Comparing the number of clubs won, both have won for two different clubs but it's not specified which club they won more titles with in the table. However, since the claim only compares their ranks as managers and not their overall achievements, we can focus on the information about their ranks.\n6. Based on the comparison of the winning years, Ernst Happel has a later winning year than Helenio Herrera, which implies that he could have potentially won after Herrera's rank was assigned, thus placing him higher in the ranking.\n7.
