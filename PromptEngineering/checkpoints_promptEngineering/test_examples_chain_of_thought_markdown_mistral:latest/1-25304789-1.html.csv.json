It contains information about various episodes of a TV show, including the order they were aired (order), their titles (episode), the date they aired in the United States (us air date), ratings (rating), share (share), and other statistics like viewers and rank within their timeslot (rank).\n\n2. Our goal is to determine if the episode \"detour\" was shown after \"baby got bank\" but before \"a modest proposal\". We can achieve this by checking the 'order' column for the corresponding rows.\n\n3. In the table, we find that \"detour\" has an order of 4 and \"baby got bank\" has an order of 5. Comparing these values, \"detour\" has a lower order number than \"baby got bank\", indicating that it was shown before \"baby got bank\". On the other hand, \"a modest proposal\" has an order of 1, which is less than both \"detour\" and \"baby got bank\", meaning it was shown before both episodes.\n\n4.
