To find out how many more gold medals France has won compared to Germany, subtract the number of gold medals won by Germany from those won by France: G - H = 7 - 5 = 2.\n3.

In this case, for France: F_total = 14 (Gold + Silver + Bronze) and for Germany: H_total = 25.\n4.

From the table, we can see that the first 9 countries are listed and their total counts add up to 263 medals. Since the total number of countries in the table is 9, these are the top 9 countries.\n\n2. Check if there's any country from the top 10 (which we have already identified as the first 9 countries) that has only bronze or silver or gold but not at least one of each. We can see from the table that every country in the top 9 has at least one of each medal (gold, silver, and bronze).\n\n3. However, South Africa (row 7) is the only country in the top 10 that doesn't have a silver medal. But since it does have gold and bronze medals, it still has at least one of each type of medal.\n\n4.

First, calculate the total medal count for each country from the 'gold', 'silver', and 'bronze' columns to find the overall medal count for each nation. This will allow us to compare the proportion of silver medals in the overall medal count for each country.\n\n2. For Germany, we have 5 gold medals, 13 silver medals, and 7 bronze medals. The total medal count is 5 + 13 + 7 = 25. So, the proportion of silver medals in Germany's overall medal count is 13/25 = 0.52 or 52%.\n\n3. Now, we compare this percentage with a threshold of 50% (more than half) to determine whether the claim holds true for Germany.
