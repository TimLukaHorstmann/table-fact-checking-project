Next, find the date when 'hasty' was completed from the table (11 November 1936).\n3. Calculate the number of months between the two completion dates by converting them into YYYY-MM-DD format and using a date library or calculating manually considering each month has 30 days on average (ignoring leap years for simplicity). The result is 11 December 1936 - 11 November 1936 = 42 days, which translates to approximately one month.\n\nBased on the table and calculation, the 'hasty' was complete one month after 'hardy' was complete.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find the completion date of hardy (11 December 1936).

    "resp": "Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find the date when the 'hasty' ship was launched from the table. The launched column for hasty has the value \"5 may 1936\".\n2. Next, we need to find the date when the 'havock' ship was launched from the table. The launched column for havock has the value \"7 july 1936\".\n3. Convert both dates into a common format for comparison (in this case, YYYY-MM-DD). So, the launch date of hasty is 1936-05-05 and the launch date of havock is 1936-07-07.\n4. Compare the converted dates to see if havock was launched 2 months and 2 days after hasty. We know that 2 months from May is July, but we need to account for the extra day (June 30th). So, we check the difference between the number of days in these two months (May and July) which is 31 (for May) and 31 + 1 = 32 (for July) plus the extra day accounted for. Now, if we subtract 5 from this sum (as that's when hasty was launched), we get 77 (total days in July without accounting for the extra day) - 5 = 72. Adding back the extra day gives us 73 days between the launch dates.\n5. Finally, check if 73 days is equal to 2 months and 2 days. We can do this by dividing the number of days (73) by the number of days in a month (30 or 31 for convenience). If the quotient is 2 with a remainder of 1, then it's equivalent to 2 months and 1 day. However, since we have an additional day, the correct interpretation would be 2 months and 2 days.\n\nSince the number of days between the launch dates (73) matches our calculation for 2 months and 2 days, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the final output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the launch date for both hasty and havock ships from the table\",\n    \"Convert the dates into a common format (YYYY-MM-DD)\",\n    \"Calculate the difference in days between the two dates\",\n    \"Check if the calculated difference matches the number of days in 2 months and 2 days\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"launched\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"launched\" }\n  ]\n}",
