    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the position column to find out who are defensive tackles. In this table, only Corey Peters has a position of \"defensive tackle\".\n\n2. Filter out the rows for the identified player(s) with the specific pick number (19). There is only one row where the pick number matches the condition: Corey Peters in round 3.\n\n3. Check if there are any other players that meet the condition \"defensive tackle and pick number of 19\". Since we have found only one such player, it means he is the only defensive tackle with a pick number of 19.\n\nSo, based on the table provided:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows where position is 'defensive tackle'.\",\n    \"Filter rows where pick number matches 19.\",\n    \"Check if there are more players with the defined conditions.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\" }\n  ]\n}",
