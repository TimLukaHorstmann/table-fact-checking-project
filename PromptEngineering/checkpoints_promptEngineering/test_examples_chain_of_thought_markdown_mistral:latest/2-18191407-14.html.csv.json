However, the provided table does not show any information about the World Cup finals.\n3. Since we don't have explicit information regarding World Cup qualification, let's assume that winning an Olympic medal automatically qualifies a shooter for the World Cup final according to the rules of the sport. In this case, it is reasonable to expect that the claim would be true if the assumption holds valid.\n4. Finally, cross-check the information by finding other athletes who also won an Olympic medal and made it to the World Cup final (from the table or additional information). Since we don't have the necessary information in this table, it is not possible to verify our conclusion definitively.\n\nSince we can make a reasonable assumption based on the available information that winning an Olympic medal would qualify for the World Cup Final, and since du li won an Olympic gold medal, the claim could be considered TRUE (assuming the rules are as assumed).
