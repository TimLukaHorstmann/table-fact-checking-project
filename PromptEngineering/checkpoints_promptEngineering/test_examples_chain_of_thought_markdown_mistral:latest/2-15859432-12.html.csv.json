Search through the rows of the table for a row where both the \"spike\" column and the \"block\" column match the specified values.\n3. If such a row is found, then there would be at least one weight value associated with both 353 spike and 340 block.\n4. Iterate through each row in the table and compare the \"spike\" and \"block\" values to the specified ones (353 and 340).\n5.

The columns represent the names, dates of birth, height, weight, spike (spiking ability), and block (blocking ability) for each player.\n  2. Read the claim carefully: \"there be 94 weight value associate with 353 spike\". This implies that there should be a row in the table where the 'weight' is 94 and 'spike' is 353.\n  3. Scan through the table to find any such combination of values. The first relevant cell is row_index=6 (William Priddy) and column_name='weight'.
