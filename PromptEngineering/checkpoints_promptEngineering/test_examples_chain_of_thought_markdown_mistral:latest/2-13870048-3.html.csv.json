    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Identify the rows for Tom Reynolds (row 26) and Sherwood Boehlert (row 24).\n2. Check the 'elected' column for both representatives to find out when they were elected. Tom Reynolds was elected in 1998, and Sherwood Boehlert was elected in 1982.\n3. Calculate the difference between the years they were elected (1998 - 1982 = 16 years).\n4. Check if 10 years have passed after Sherwood Boehlert since Tom Reynolds was elected. Since it's been more than 10 years, we need to check for intervals of 10 years to see if there is a match.\n5. To do this, we find the next multiple of 10 that is greater than or equal to the difference calculated (next multiple of 10 after 16 = 20).\n6. Check if the current year minus the year Sherwood Boehlert was elected equals the found multiple of 10. This means we are looking for the current year - 1982 = 39 (since 39 mod 10 = 9 and 20 + 9 = 29).\n7. Check the 'status' column for Tom Reynolds to see if he is still running or not, since we are looking for a year that is exactly 39 years after Sherwood Boehlert was elected. The 'status' of Tom Reynolds is \"running\".\n8. Since Tom Reynolds is still running, we can compare the current year with the calculated year (20XX - 1982 = 39) to see if they match or are close enough (assuming a range of +/- 1 year). If they do, it means that Tom Reynolds was elected 10 years after Sherwood Boehlert.\n\nNow let's output the final answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the rows for Tom Reynolds and Sherwood Boehlert\",\n    \"Check the 'elected' column for both representatives\",\n    \"Calculate the difference between their election years\",\n    \"Check if 10 years have passed after Sherwood Boehlert since Tom Reynolds was elected\",\n    \"Find the next multiple of 10 that is greater than or equal to the difference calculated\",\n    \"Compare the current year with the calculated year\",\n    \"Check the 'status' column for Tom Reynolds\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 24,\n      \"column_name\": \"elected\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 26,\n      \"column_name\": \"elected\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 26,\n      \"column_name\": \"status\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
