The values in the first column of each row indicate the round number for the corresponding location.\n5. In row 11, the value in the first column is not provided (it's just a dash). However, since there are no empty rows in the table and the round numbers are consecutive, if \"jacksonville\" had a round different from 11, it would have been listed in one of the previous rows.\n6.
