    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim is that Chen Yanchong would be easy to beat, which means that she frequently loses matches (or has a poor win-loss record).\n2. Find all instances where Chen Yanchong was an opponent in the given table: The only row where Chen Yanchong appears as the opponent is the first row, indicating that she was the runner-up in the Mumbai tournament on March 3, 2004, and lost the match against our player.\n3. Analyze the win-loss record for each opponent: In this table, we only have information about two matches involving Chen Yanchong (the first row) as an opponent. She has lost one match (first row).\n4. Determine if the claim is supported: Since we have evidence of at least one loss by Chen Yanchong in the given table, it would be reasonable to consider her as someone who might be easy to beat, based on this limited data. However, having just two data points is not enough to definitively conclude that she is \"easy\" to beat, especially without knowing her overall win-loss record or performance against other opponents outside the provided table.\n5. Output final answer: Since we cannot make a definitive conclusion with only two data points, our answer should reflect this uncertainty.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim: Chen Yanchong might be easy to beat because she loses frequently.\",\n    \"Find all instances where Chen Yanchong was an opponent in the table: First row.\",\n    \"Analyze the win-loss record for each opponent: 1 loss, 0 wins.\",\n    \"Determine if the claim is supported: Limited data supports the claim but does not prove it definitively.\",\n    \"Output final answer: The claim cannot be definitively answered.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
