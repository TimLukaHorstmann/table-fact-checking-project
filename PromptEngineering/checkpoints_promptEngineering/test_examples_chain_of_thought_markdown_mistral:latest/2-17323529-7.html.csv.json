Find the row in the table that corresponds to game 40 (row index 40). The values under \"team\" and \"score\" columns are \"minnesota\" and \"l 86 - 94 (ot)\", respectively.\n3. Look for the column names that might have information relevant to the claim: \"high points\", \"high rebounds\", \"high assists\".\n4.
