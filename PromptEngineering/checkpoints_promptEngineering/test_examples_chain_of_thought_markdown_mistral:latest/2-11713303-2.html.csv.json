    "resp": "Here are the steps to analyze the claim:\n\n1. Identify the manager mentioned in the claim, Val\u00e8re Billen, and find his replacement in the table.\n2. Find any instances where the replaced manager is Val\u00e8re Billen (from step 1) and the manager who took his place is Dennis van Wijk.\n3. Check if there's any subsequent change of manager for the team that initially had Dennis van Wijk as a replacement for Val\u00e8re Billen.\n4. Determine if the manager who took over from Dennis van Wijk (from step 3) was Peter Voets and if this happened in the 2007-2008 season.\n\nBased on the table provided, the steps are followed as follows:\n\n1. Val\u00e8re Billen can be found in row 0 of the table.\n2. Dennis van Wijk is mentioned as a replacement for Peter Voets (who took over from Val\u00e8re Billen) in row 5, and Peter Voets is not mentioned as replacing anyone. However, we will check if there's any subsequent change of manager for the team that initially had Dennis van Wijk as a replacement for Val\u00e8re Billen.\n3. In row 6, it shows that Peter Voets was replaced by Dennis van Wijk (the same team where Val\u00e8re Billen was initially replaced by Dennis van Wijk).\n4. The date of appointment for Dennis van Wijk is 10 December 2007 and the date of appointment for Peter Voets is also 10 December 2007, which falls within the 2007-2008 season.\n\nSince all four conditions were met, it can be concluded that the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find Val\u00e8re Billen and his replacement in the table\",\n    \"Check if there's any instance where Val\u00e8re Billen was replaced by Dennis van Wijk\",\n    \"Verify if there's a subsequent change of manager for the team that initially had Dennis van Wijk as a replacement for Val\u00e8re Billen\",\n    \"Determine if the manager who took over from Dennis van Wijk (Peter Voets) and this happened in the 2007-2008 season\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"replaced by\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date of vacancy\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date of appointment\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date of appointment\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
