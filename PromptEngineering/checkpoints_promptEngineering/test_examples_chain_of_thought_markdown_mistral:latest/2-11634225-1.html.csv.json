Compare this information with other software that have 'various' as their cost in the same table.\n4. Inspect the table to find other software that have 'various' as their cost. We found the following ones: 'cdcheck', 'data digester', 'fastsum', 'teracopy', and 'winhasher'.\n5. Since 'beaversfv' does not fall under these 4 software with various costs, we need to investigate further.\n6. Upon closer examination, it appears that the table might be incomplete or inconsistent as there are some rows where the cost column has 'various' and others have specific values like 'free'. The 'beaversfv' row shows 'free', which can be considered as a form of \"various\" since there is no clear distinction between free and various costs.\n7.
