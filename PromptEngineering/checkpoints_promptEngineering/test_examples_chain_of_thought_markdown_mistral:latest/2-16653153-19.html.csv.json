Scan the table rows for the date \"December 4\": In this case, there is only one row matching the given date, which is the third row.\n\n3. Check if the venue column has any value for this specific row: The venue for the game on December 4 is mentioned as the \"cairns convention centre\" (CCC) in the third row.\n\n4. Determine if a game was played at the north shore event centre (NSEC): Since the claim does not specify the home or away team, we need to check if any other venue listed in the table matches the NSEC.
