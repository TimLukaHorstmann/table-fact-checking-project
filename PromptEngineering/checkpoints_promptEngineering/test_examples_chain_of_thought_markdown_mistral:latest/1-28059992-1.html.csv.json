Since there are no column names indicating the pick numbers, we need to find a pattern or common characteristic among the rows where the pick number is implicitly given (since it's a sorted list).\n\n2. Observe that the team columns seem to be alphabetically sorted. The picks within each team also appear to be in ascending order. For example, the first row shows Chad Folk as pick 1 for Toronto Argonauts. Since there is only one player listed per team and per position, we can infer that the pick number corresponds to the order of players listed for each team.\n\n3. Now that we have established the pattern, compare the positions and teams of Mark Farraway (Edmonton) and Chad Folk (Toronto). If Mark Farraway is before Chad Folk in terms of the implicit pick numbers within their respective teams, then the claim would be true.\n\n4. Check the table: The row for Mark Farraway (row index 8) shows him as a player for Edmonton. The row for Chad Folk (row index 1) shows him as a player for Toronto.
