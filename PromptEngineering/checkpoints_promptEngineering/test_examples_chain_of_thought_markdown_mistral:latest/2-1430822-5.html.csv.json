Check each row of the table for the team name and look for the season when they were champions.\n3. Observe that in the year 2010, the champion was 'rapax' and not 'barwa international campos team'. However, since 'rapax' is a sponsor or partner of a team (as indicated by the champion), it's possible that this partnership resulted in a win for 'barwa international campos team'.\n4. To confirm, look for any rows where 'barwa international campos team' appears as the team champion. No such row exists in the table.\n5. Since we cannot find any evidence of 'barwa international campos team' being champions in 2010 based on the given information, it means that the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe final answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the team to investigate (barwa international campos team)\", \"Check each row for the team name and look for champion year\", \"Observe that in 2010, the champion was 'rapax', but it's possible they were part of the same partnership\", \"Confirm by looking for rows where 'barwa international campos team' appears as the champion\", \"Since no such row exists, conclude that the claim is FALSE\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"champion\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"team champion\" }\n  ]\n}",
