This will help us narrow down our search for a world junior championship that has this note.\n2. From the filtered results, check the `year` column for any matching year '2006' to confirm if there is indeed a world junior championship with the note of 1500m in 2006.\n\nThe table shows two rows where the notes column mentions '1500 m'. One from the World Youth Championships in 2005 and another from the World Junior Championships in 2006.
