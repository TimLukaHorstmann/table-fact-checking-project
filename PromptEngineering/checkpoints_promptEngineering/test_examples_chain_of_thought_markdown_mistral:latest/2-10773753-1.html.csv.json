Check the number of unique teams listed in the table: Identify all the distinct home teams, which are geelong, fitzroy, collingwood, carlton, st kilda, Richmond, and footscray (away team for one match).\n   2. Count the number of unique teams to see if it matches the total number of teams in a league season: There are 7 unique teams listed.\n      3. Since there are no missing teams from the list and all teams compete at least once against each other, we can infer that every team has played against another team in this season.\n   4. To confirm that it is indeed a league season where every team competes against each other: In a round-robin tournament (like a football league season), there would be `(number of teams * (number of teams - 1)) / 2` matches. In our case, `(7 * 6) / 2 = 21` matches are expected. We can check if the number of unique matches in the table is equal to this number: There are 6 distinct matches in the table, which is less than the expected 21.\n      5. However, we cannot definitively say that there are only these 6 matches because not all matches for each team have been accounted for in the table. For example, a team may play twice at home and once away (or vice versa) against another team, but only one match is listed in the table. To prove the claim, we would need to see every match involving these 7 teams during the 1955 season.\n  6. Final answer: The claim can neither be confirmed nor denied with the provided information.
