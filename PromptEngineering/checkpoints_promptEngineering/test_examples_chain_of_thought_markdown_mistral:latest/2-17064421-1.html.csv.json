From the table, there are only two players (Gene Banks and Ed Rains) who have a round value of 2.\n   3. Since both players meet the condition, it's necessary to check if their pick values are equal to 28 or 30, as per the claim.\n   4. By examining the 'pick' column for these two players, we find that Gene Banks has a pick of 28 and Ed Rains has a pick of 30.\n   5. The claim states that both Gene Bank and Ed Rain should be the 2nd-round picks, which means their pick values should be equal to either 28 or 30. In this case, only Gene Banks matches the condition as he was picked 28th overall.\n   6. Therefore, it's incorrect to claim that both Gene Bank and Ed Rain were 2nd-round picks since only Gene Banks meets the specified criteria (picked in the 2nd round with a pick value of 28).\n\n   Final answer:\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Check players with round = 2\", \"Compare pick values of those players to 28 or 30\", \"Find that only Gene Banks meets the condition (picked 28th overall)\"],\n     \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}]\n   }",
