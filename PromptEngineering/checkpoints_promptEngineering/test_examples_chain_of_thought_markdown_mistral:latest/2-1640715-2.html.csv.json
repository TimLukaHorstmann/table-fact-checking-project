    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process step by step:\n\n1. First, we identify the number of starts for each year for Mike Skinner, as we are given the claim about his busiest race year. We know that the 'starts' column corresponds to the number of starts in each year.\n\n2. Next, we find Mike Skinner's row index by searching through the 'team (s)' column and finding any rows where a team associated with Mike Skinner is listed. Based on our table, we can see that Mike Skinner was part of Team Yellow Racing in 1999, 2000, and 2000 (according to the table's structure, it looks like he had two teams in 2000: 19 team yellow racing and 15 andy petree racing). However, we cannot definitively determine which team is Mike Skinner's since the table doesn't specify that.\n\n3. For each year that Mike Skinner was part of a team (1999, 2000, and potentially other years if he had more teams), we compare the number of starts in those years with the number of starts in 2006, which is the year we are told is the busiest. In this case, our table doesn't provide Mike Skinner's starts in any year except for 1987 and 1999-2003. However, if we assume that he didn't participate in racing from 1988 to 1991 (as no data is provided), we can infer that the number of starts in those missing years is zero.\n\n4. To check Mike Skinner's busiest year, we compare the number of starts in his known years with the number of starts in 2006:\n   - For 1999, Mike had 13 starts.\n   - For 2000, Mike had 8 starts (according to the table; assuming that he also had zero starts for team 15 andy petree racing, as there's no data provided).\n   - In 2001, Mike had 14 starts.\n   - For 2003, Mike had 1 start.\n   - And in 2006, Mike had 9 starts.\n\n5. Based on the comparison, we find that in 2006, Mike Skinner did have 9 starts, which is equal to or greater than his number of starts in any other known year (13, 8, 14, and 1).
