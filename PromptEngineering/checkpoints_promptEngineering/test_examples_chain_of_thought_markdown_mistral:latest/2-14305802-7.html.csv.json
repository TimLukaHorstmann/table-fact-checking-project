    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. First, we scan the table to find the game played on March 28th. The game number corresponds to the row index in the table. In this case, the game on March 28th is the one with a game number of 74.\n2. Then, we identify the opponent for that game by looking at the \"opponent\" column in the same row (74th row). The opponent for game 74 is Colorado Rockies.\n3. Based on this information, we can confirm that the claim is true as the opponent that played on March 28th was indeed the Colorado Rockies.\n\n   Final answer:\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\n       \"Find the game played on March 28th by looking at the 'date' column and identifying its corresponding row index.\",\n       \"Identify the opponent for that game by checking the 'opponent' column in the same row.\"\n     ],\n     \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       { \"row_index\": 74, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" }\n     ]\n   }",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to find the answer:\n\n1. The claim mentions that we should find the opponent on March 24th, but the table doesn't provide information about the dates. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact date from the given table. However, we can still compare the opponents listed in the table and check if \"colorado rockies\" is one of them.\n\n2. By scanning the 'opponent' column in the table, we see that \"colorado rockies\" appears twice: rows 67 (Atlanta Flames vs Colorado Rockies) and 49 (Colorado Rockies vs Toronto Maple Leafs). Since the claim doesn't specify any other details about the match, both games with Colorado Rockies as opponents are potential matches on March 24th.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The table does not provide information about dates.\",\n    \"However, we can compare the opponents listed in the 'opponent' column to check if 'colorado rockies' is one of them.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"UNKNOWN\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 67, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 49, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" }\n  ]\n}",
