Find the row corresponding to Marcus Marshall in the table. The row index of this driver can be found by looking at the table and identifying that Marcus Marshall is the 16th name in the list, so he corresponds to the row with an index of 15 (since the first row has an index of 0).\n3. Look for the 'best' column for the row corresponding to Marcus Marshall. The best time for a driver can be found by looking at the column labeled 'best'.\n4. Read the value in the 'best' cell for Marcus Marshall's row. In this case, the value is '59.2'.\n\nSince the value in the 'best' cell for Marcus Marshall's row is exactly what we are checking (i.e., 59.2), our final answer is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the driver for whom we are checking the best time\",\n    \"Find the row corresponding to Marcus Marshall in the table\",\n    \"Look for the 'best' column for the row corresponding to Marcus Marshall\",\n    \"Read the value in the 'best' cell for Marcus Marshall's row\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"best\" }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify all teams from the table. In this case, there are 5 distinct teams: forsythe racing, pkv racing, newman/haas racing, mi - jack conquest racing, and rocketsports racing.\n2. For each team except rocketsports racing, check if any driver has a qual 2 time of 58 and a best less than 57. In this case:\n   - Forsythe racing: Both Paul Tracy (57.419) and Mario Dom\u00ednguez (57.942) have a best less than 57, but neither has a qual 2 time of 58. So, no drivers from forsythe racing meet the condition.\n   - Pkv racing: Both Cristiano da Matta (57.424) and Jimmy Vasser (58.029) have a best less than 57, but neither has a qual 2 time of 58. So, no drivers from pkv racing meet the condition.\n   - Newman/haas racing: Both S\u00e9bastien Bourdais (57.559) and Oriol Servi\u00e0 (57.917) have a best less than 57, but neither has a qual 2 time of 58. So, no drivers from newman/haas racing meet the condition.\n   - Mi - jack conquest racing: Both Andrew Ranger (57.801) and Nelson Philippe (58.844) have a best less than 57, but neither has a qual 2 time of 58. So, no drivers from mi - jack conquest racing meet the condition.\n3.
