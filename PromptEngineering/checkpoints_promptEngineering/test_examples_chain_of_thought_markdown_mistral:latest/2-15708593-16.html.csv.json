First, we need to determine which shows are on at 8:00 pm, 9:00 pm, 10:00 pm, and check if there's a pattern or progression in the table for those slots. From the given data, it seems that the show playing at each time slot is repeated every hour (except for the last two entries which are local programming).\n\n2. Since we know that the shows are repeated every hour, we can deduce that if a show X was on at 8:00 pm, then it will be on at 9:00 pm as well. If X is not 'the bachelorette', then X should be playing at 9:30 pm, and the show at 10:00 pm will be something else (not 'the bachelorette').\n\n3. Now let's check if there's any show that was on at 8:00 pm and is 'the bachelorette'. In our table, we find 'the bachelorette' at the 8:00 pm slot.\n\n4. If 'the bachelorette' continues to be played every hour (as suggested by the pattern in the table), it will still be on at 9:00 pm and 10:00 pm as well. However, since we know that 'dating in the dark' is the show scheduled for 10:00 pm, and there seems to be no exception to this hourly pattern, 'the bachelorette' should not be playing at 10:00 pm.\n\n5.
