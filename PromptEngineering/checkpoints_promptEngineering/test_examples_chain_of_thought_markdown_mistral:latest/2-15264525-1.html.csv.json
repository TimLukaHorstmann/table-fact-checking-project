Since the claim specifies that the US should have no silver medals, we only consider gold and bronze medals in our comparison.\n4.

The total count of gold and bronze medals for the US is 5 + 0 = 5.\n5. We now compare this total with other nations' totals. Since other countries have some silver medals, their total medal counts will always be greater than or equal to that of the United States (ignoring silver medals in comparison).\n6.
