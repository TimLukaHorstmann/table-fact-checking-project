    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n   1. Identify the table column names to find the points (total) and tries (total number of scores in a match). In this case, the relevant columns are \"points\" and \"tries for\".\n   2. Look for the team that scored 21 points, as stated in the claim. From the table, no team has exactly 21 points.\n   3. However, it's important to note that the question asks about a team scoring 21 points, but there is no such team in the provided data.\n\nSince there is no team that scored 21 points according to the given data, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify columns with relevant information\",\n    \"Find the team that scored 21 points\",\n    \"Check if the 'tries for' value for the found team is 22\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"tries for\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n1. First, I will look for the row related to 'caerau ely rfc'. This can be found with a row_index of 8 (the second row starting from 0).\n2. Then, I will check the column corresponding to 'losing bonus' in the given row to see the number of losses for 'caerau ely rfc'. The losing bonus value is 4.\n3. Next, I will look for the number of draws for 'caerau ely rfc'. This can be found in the column corresponding to 'drawn', also in the given row. However, since there are no drawn games listed (the value is 0), I would need to verify if the word \"draw\" in the claim refers to the number of times they won a draw or simply the number of draws without considering wins.\n4. Since the number of losses and the drawing information from the table doesn't match with the claim, it's important to clarify what is meant by 'losing point' before making a final determination. In this case, assuming 'losing point' refers to the losing bonus (since that matches the context of the rest of the table), I can say that the number of losses for 'caerau ely rfc' corresponds to their losing bonus, which is 4.\n5. Now, since I cannot determine if they have drawn 12 games without further clarification, I will not confirm if the claim about drawing 12 games is true or false.\n\nHere's my final answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find row related to 'caerau ely rfc'.\",\n    \"Check losing bonus for 'caerau ely rfc'.\",\n    \"Verify the number of draws for 'caerau ely rfc'.\",\n    \"Determine if the term 'losing point' is consistent with the context of the table.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE (for losing bonus)\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"losing bonus\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"drawn\" }\n  ]\n}",
