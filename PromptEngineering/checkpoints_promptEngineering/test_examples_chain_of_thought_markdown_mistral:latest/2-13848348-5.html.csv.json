Identify the date for which we want to find the attendance: The claim specifies that the date is April 29, so we need to look at the row of data where the \"date\" column has the value \"april 29\".\n\n2. Find the row in the table corresponding to the specified date: Scroll through the table or search for the row index (index numbering starts from 1) with the date as \"april 29\". The correct row index is 29.\n\n3. Extract the relevant data for that row: From the row corresponding to the date \"april 29\", find the value in the \"attendance\" column. This will give us the attendance figure for April 29.\n\n4. Compare the extracted figure with the claim: Compare the attendance figure obtained in step 3 with the attendance claimed in the original statement, i.e., \"49194\".\n\n5. Output the final answer: If the extracted figure matches the claimed value, then the answer is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE. In this case, since the attendance for April 29 is indeed 49194, the answer would be TRUE.\n\nHere is the output in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the date for which we want to find the attendance (April 29), Find the row in the table corresponding to the specified date (row index 29), Extract the relevant data for that row (attendance value from the row with index 29), Compare the extracted figure with the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}]\n}",

Once we have found the row corresponding to April 9th, we need to check the value of the attendance column in that row. The attendance values are located in the fourth column of the table.\n\n3.

In other words, we need to find the attendance for the row following the row with \"tigers\" and \"6 - 2\".\n3. The row following the row with \"tigers\" is the row with \"indians\", as per the chronological order of the dates.
