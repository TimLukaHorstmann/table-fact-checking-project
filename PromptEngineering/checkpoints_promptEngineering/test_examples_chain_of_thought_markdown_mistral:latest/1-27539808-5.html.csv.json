    "resp": "1. Identify the game in question: The claim mentions \"december 1\", but the table only lists games on specific dates, not general days of the month. Therefore, we must find the game whose date is closest to December 1st.\n\n2. Compare the dates: By looking at the table, it appears that the first game (row index=0) took place on December 1st (column header \"december\"). However, since we cannot have a specific day of the month in the table, we must look for the closest match in sequence to December.\n\n3. Determine the location and attendance: Once we've identified the relevant game as the first one, we need to check its location and attendance details.\n\n4. Examine the relevant cells: The location of the first game is \"wells fargo center\" (row index=0, column name=\"location / attendance\"), and the attendance is 19684 (row index=0, column name=\"attendance\").\n\n5. Evaluate the claim: The claim mentions \"well fargo center (19684) be the location and attendance total from the game on December 1\". Since both the location (\"wells fargo center\") and the attendance (19684) match with the first game in our table, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the game in question based on its date\",\n    \"Compare the dates to find the closest match to December 1st\",\n    \"Determine the location and attendance for that game\",\n    \"Examine the relevant cells to confirm the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
