Determine the values of the \"points\" column for places 1 and 15:\n   - Place 1: The points associated with place 1 can be found by looking at the rows where the \"place\" column equals 1. In this table, there is only one row (row 1) with a \"place\" value of 1, and the \"points\" value for that row is 5.\n   - Place 15: The points associated with place 15 can be found by looking at the rows where the \"place\" column equals 15. In this table, there are four rows (rows 8, 15, 16, and 17) with a \"place\" value of 15, and their corresponding \"points\" values are 0, 0, 0, and 2 respectively.\n\n3. Compare the points of place 1 to the average of the points of place 15:\n   - To compare if place 1's points are over 30 higher than the points of those in place 15, we first need to find the average points for place 15. We calculate this by summing up the \"points\" values for the rows where the \"place\" column equals 15 and divide it by the number of such rows (i.e., 4). So, the average points for place 15 is (0 + 0 + 0 + 2) / 4 = 0.5.\n   - Then we compare this average (0.5) to the points of place 1 (5).
