Determine the outgoing manager of Burnley from the 'team' and 'outgoing manager' columns. In this case, it's Brian Law (row 10).\n3. Check if there's a corresponding incoming manager for Burnley. There isn't one in our table as the table doesn't show the incoming manager for all teams. However, we can see that a new manager, Eddie Howe, was appointed on row 14 (14 January 2011) which is after the departure of Brian Law on row 10 (29 December 2010).\n4. Since there's no incoming manager shown for Burnley in our table and the changeover occurred before any other team, we can deduce that Burnley remained without a manager between the departure of Brian Law and the appointment of Eddie Howe.\n5.

Check the position of Coventry City immediately before Andy Thorn's departure: In our table, Andy Thorn was replaced by Andy Thorn on 28 April 2011.
