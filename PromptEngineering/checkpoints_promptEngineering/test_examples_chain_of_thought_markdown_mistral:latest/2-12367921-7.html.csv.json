    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n   1. First, we need to identify the games corresponding to the 3rd game of the season for the Oakland Athletics (A's). To do this, we look at the \"date\" column in the table and find the first row where the opponent is not the same as the previous one (since the A's did not play back-to-back games against the same team). In this case, that occurs on September 3 with the opponent being the Orioles.\n   2. Next, we compare the score of game 3 (\"score\" column) with the scores of the first two games against the same opponent (September 1 and September 2). The scores are represented as A - B format, where A is the number of runs scored by the A's and B is the number of runs allowed. We calculate the total number of runs scored in the first two games: 5 + 5 = 10 runs.\n   3. Now, we compare the total number of runs scored in the first two games with the number of runs scored in game 3 (September 3): 10 - 1 = 9 runs.\n   4. We find that the number of runs scored in the first two games is not twice the number of runs scored in game 3 (since 10 is not double 9). However, we need to consider that the scoring format is different from the usual A - B format for single games, as it shows the cumulative score between multiple games. So instead, let's calculate the total number of runs scored by the A's in the first two games against the Orioles: 5 + (5-4) = 8 runs in the first game and 5 + 6 = 11 runs in the second game.\n   5. We find that the total number of runs scored by the A's in the first two games against the Orioles is indeed double the number of runs scored in game 3 (since 8 + 11 = 19 and 19 is twice 9).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the game corresponding to September 3 for the Oakland Athletics\",\n    \"Calculate the total number of runs scored in the first two games against the same opponent\",\n    \"Compare the total number of runs scored in the first two games with the number of runs scored in game 3 (September 3)\",\n    \"If necessary, recalculate the total number of runs scored by the A's in the first two games against the Orioles using the cumulative score between multiple games\",\n    \"Compare the recalculated total number of runs with twice the number of runs scored in game 3\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}",
