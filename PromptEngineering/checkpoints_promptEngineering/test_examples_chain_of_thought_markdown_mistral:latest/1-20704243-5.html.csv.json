Next, we look for the column 'written by' to find out who wrote this series. The written by column for this series is in cell D9.\n3. In cell D9, it is stated that 'the queen\u2019s gambit job' was written by 'm scott veach & rebecca kirsch'.\n4. Since the claim is \"series number 54 be written by m scott veach & rebecca kirsch\", we compare this with the information found in step 3. The claim matches with the information from the table.\n\nWith these steps, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\nHere's the output as a valid JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify series number 54\",\n    \"Find the column 'written by'\",\n    \"Locate the written by information for series number 54\",\n    \"Compare the claim with the information from step 3\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"written by\" }\n  ]\n}",

However, the claim also specifies the original air date of the episode. Check if the given date matches with any dates in the table for this particular row (series and season). In our table, the original air date for the \"the 10 li'l grifters job\" is \"july 3 , 2011\", which does match a date in the table.\n5. Since both parts of the claim have been verified separately but contradict each other (directed by being incorrect while original air date being correct), we cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim based on this information alone.
