Scan through the table to find a row where both the home team and away team match with the given team names.\n3.

    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the game we need to check from the table, which is the one played on November 29. This can be determined by looking for rows where the date column matches \"29 november\". In this case, there are two such rows (4th and 8th). We'll consider each of them.\n\n2. For the first game on November 29 between Adelaide 36ers and Wollongong Hawks, we check the venue column to see if it is the state sports center. It is not, so this game does not match our claim.\n\n3. For the second game on November 29 between Perth Wildcats and Melbourne Tigers, we check the venue column to see if it is the state sport center. The venue listed for this game is marrara stadium, which does not match our claim.\n\n4. Since neither of the games played on November 29 meets the criteria specified in the claim, we can conclude that the Melbourne Tigers' November 29 game was not at the state sports center.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the game to check by looking for rows where date = '29 november'\",\n    \"Check if the venue in each of the games is state sports center\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"venue\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
