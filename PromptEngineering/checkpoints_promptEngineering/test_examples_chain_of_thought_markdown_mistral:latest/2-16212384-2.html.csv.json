Look at the 'grid' column for that specific row and note the value, which is 1 in this case.\n4. Since the claim mentions the next rider with the lowest grid position follows Alvaro Bautista, we need to find the next row (in sorted order) where the 'rider' is not the same as our current rider and the 'grid' value is greater than or equal to 1.\n5. In the table, there are two other rows where 'manufacturer' is aprilia and 'time' is greater than Alvaro Bautista's time (indicating a higher position in the race). However, the 'grid' column shows grid positions 2 for Alex Debon and 3 for H\u00e9ctor Barbera. Since the claim states that the next rider with the lowest grid position follows Alvaro Bautista, we cannot move forward to check these rows because they have higher grid positions than Alvaro Bautista.\n6.
