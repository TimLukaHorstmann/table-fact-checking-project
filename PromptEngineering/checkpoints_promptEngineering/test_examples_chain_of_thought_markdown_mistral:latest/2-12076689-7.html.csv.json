    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. Check the table for any repeated opponent names. The opponents are listed across rows, so if a row is repeated, it means the team played against each other more than once.\n2. In this case, the 'opponent' column has two teams repeated multiple times: Indians and Mariners.\n3. Count the number of times each opponent is repeated to confirm the claim. If the count matches 9 for the Mariners, it will be confirmed that they played against the Rangers 9 times in the 2006 season.\n4. Count the rows with 'opponent' as 'mariners'. There are 10 such rows. However, since the first row represents a match on September 1 and the last row represents a match on October 1, there is an extra row because October 2 is not listed (the table starts from September 1 and ends on October 30). So, to find the number of actual matches against Mariners, we subtract 1 from the total number of rows.\n5. Subtracting 1 from 10 gives us 9.

To confirm that these games are different, we check if any pair of games share the same date, opponent, or loss information.\n4. We find that no pairs share the same date or opponent, and while two games have the same loss (i.e., 'zito' for Athletics on September 4th and 'byrd' for Indians on September 22nd), they are not the same game because their respective attendance numbers differ significantly (23949 vs 26284).\n5.
