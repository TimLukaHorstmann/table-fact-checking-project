Examine the 'goals per match' column for any values greater than 1.237 in the table.\n3. Find and analyze the rows where the 'goals per match' value exceeds 1.237: only the first three rows (Lionel Messi in seasons 2011/12 and 2012/13, and Ferenc Puskas in season 1959/60) meet this condition.\n4. Compare the ranks of these players to see if they all have the same rank or if any one of them has a lower rank: none of them share the same rank.\n5. Conclude that the claim is TRUE because at least one player (Ferenc Puskas in season 1959/60) has a 'goals per match' value greater than 1.237 and does not have rank 11 or higher.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the target value (1.237)\",\n    \"Examine the 'goals per match' column for any values greater than 1.237\",\n    \"Find and analyze the rows where the 'goals per match' value exceeds 1.237\",\n    \"Compare ranks of these players to see if they all have the same rank or if any one has a lower rank\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals per match\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals per match\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals per match\" }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we identify the player mentioned in the claim: Lionel Messi.\n2. Next, we check the seasons for which Lionel Messi played for Barcelona (the club mentioned in the claim). We see that he has multiple entries for different seasons.\n3. For each season, we compare the rank of Lionel Messi to ensure he is ranked 2 or higher, as claimed.\n4. Then, for the seasons where he is ranked 2 or higher, we check if he scored 73 goals.\n5. We see that in the 2011/12 season, Lionel Messi is indeed ranked 1, but he did score 73 goals.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify player and club from claim\", \"Check seasons for the given player\", \"Filter seasons where player rank is 2 or higher (or higher)\", \"Check if player scored 73 goals in filtered seasons\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}]\n}\n```",
