The claim suggests that these institutions should be located in Kentucky.\n2.

From the given table, we find seven colleges/universities from Kentucky: Bluefield College, Campbellsville University, Cumberland University, University of the Cumberlands, Georgetown College, Lindsey Wilson College, and University of Pikeville. Among these institutions, four are members of the Mid-South Conference (Bluefield College, Campbellsville University, Lindsey Wilson College, and University of Pikeville).\n4. Since all the Mid-South Conference member institutions we found are located in Kentucky, this implies that most (not all but a majority) of the Mid-South Conference institutions are located in Kentucky.\n5.
