The dates are listed in row 1 (7 September 2010), row 3 (6 October 2010), row 2 (7 June 2011), row 5 (10 August 2011), row 6 (11 September 2011), row 7 (7 September 2012), and row 8 (16 October 2012).\n\n2. Examine the competition column for each date to determine if they belong to the same stadium, specifically pusk\u00e1s stadium, budapest. The first and last dates do not have the same venue as the others, so we will focus on the remaining dates: row 3 (6 October 2010), row 2 (7 June 2011), row 5 (10 August 2011), and row 6 (11 September 2011).\n\n3. Check if all these dates share the same venue (stadio olimpico in San Marino or pusk\u00e1s stadium in Budapest). It is evident that they share the same venue, pusk\u00e1s stadium, budapest.\n\n4. Since all the remaining dates have the same stadium and are listed in order from earliest to latest, it means that the earliest date is indeed 7 September 2010 as stated in the claim, and the latest date is 16 October 2012. Furthermore, both these dates belong to competitions held at the pusk\u00e1s stadium, budapest, which matches the claim's statement that the earliest date be a competition at szusza stadium (another venue in Budapest) and the latest date be a competition at pusk\u00e1s stadium.\n\n5.
