Identify the team we are looking for - In this case, it's the Toronto Blue Jays (as the question refers to their attendance in May of the 1991 season). However, the table doesn't provide specific data for each game played by the Blue Jays, so I need to find out which games the Blue Jays were playing at home during this period.\n2. Determine the opponent for each day - By looking at the \"opponent\" column, we can see that the Toronto Blue Jays faced the Rangers (may 1, may 7, and may 8), the Royals (may 2 to may 5, may 13 to may 15, and may 17), the White Sox (may 9 to may 12, may 18, may 19, and may 20), the Athletics (may 21 to may 23), and the Angels (may 24 to may 31).\n3. Identify the home games - Since we're looking for attendance lower than 5000, it might be advantageous to look for games where the Toronto Blue Jays were playing at home because their attendance numbers are provided in the table.\n4. Check the dates for possible home games - By observing the dates in the \"date\" column and noting that the team is facing multiple opponents more than once, we can surmise that it's likely some of these repeated opponent matches were played at home (for example, may 1-may 5 might have been a series with the Royals, with game 1 being at home).\n5. Analyze the attendance numbers - Once we identify potential home games, we can check if any of them had an attendance lower than 50,000 (since all numbers provided are in thousands and exceed 50,000). If there is a number below 50,000, it would mean the game was played at home with less than 50,000 attendees.\n6. Find the relevant cells - In this case, we don't have enough information to identify specific rows (home games) that had an attendance of less than 50,000 because there is no indication in the table of which games were home or away for the Toronto Blue Jays.
