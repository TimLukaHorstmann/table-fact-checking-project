    "resp": "Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the player we are looking for: \"geremi\".\n2. Locate the row corresponding to this player in the table. In this case, the row index is 35 (from the bottom since row indices start at 0).\n3. Check the column names for this row. We are interested in the fourth column as it corresponds to the \"uefa champions league\" and the FIFA club world championship.\n4. Look up the values in the fourth column for the row index of geremi. The value is 0.\n5. Since the player geremi has 0 wins in the \"uefa champions league\", we look for possible wins in other competitions (i.e., the FIFA club world championship).\n6. Continue looking up the values in the fourth column for the row index of geremi but check the column name as well to ensure we are still on the correct row.\n7. Find that there is a 1 in the \"fifa club world championship\" column, which indicates that geremi has won one such competition.\n8. Recapitulate the findings: The player geremi has won 1 FIFA club world championship (as indicated by the value of 1 in the fourth row and third column) and no UEFA Champions League titles (as indicated by the value of 0 in the fourth row and second column).\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify player: geremi\",\n    \"Locate row index for geremi\",\n    \"Check values in all columns, focusing on UEFA champions league and FIFA club world championship\",\n    \"Recapitulate findings: geremi has won 1 FIFA club world championship and no UEFA Champions League titles\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 35,\n      \"column_name\": \"fifa club world championship\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 35,\n      \"column_name\": \"uefa champions league\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
