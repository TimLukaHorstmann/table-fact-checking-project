Here, the second column is labeled as 'no in season', which seems to represent the episode number within a season. The first column, 'no in series' appears to be the total episode number across all seasons.\n2. Then, we find the row that corresponds to the episode number 1 for the season. According to the table, there is only one episode with an episode number of 1 in the second column (in the row with 'no in season' as 1).\n3. We then check the original air date for this row, which is indeed 'january 3 , 1997'.\n4.
