This can be determined by checking the 'time / retired' column for any signs of a penalty or retirement (e.g., a plus sign + before the time, or any non-numeric value). From the table, only Gerhard Berger, Michael Schumacher, and Mika H\u00e4kkinen meet this criteria.\n\n3. Check if there are more drivers who completed 81 laps but have some other issue that prevented them from being counted in step 2 (e.g., accidents, collisions, mechanical failures, etc.). This can be done by looking at the 'time / retired' and relevant grid position columns to see if these issues are mentioned. From the table, there are no such drivers.\n\n4.
