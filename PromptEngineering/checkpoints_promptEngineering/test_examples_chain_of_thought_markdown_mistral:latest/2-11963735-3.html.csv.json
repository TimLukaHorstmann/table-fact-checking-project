The relevant cell for this is the one where \"trail blazers\" appears as the 'visitor'. The row index of this cell is 8 and the column name is 'home'.\n2. Check if they lost that game by looking at the 'score' column. In the row where 'trail blazers' is the visitor, the score shows '93 - 110', which indicates the Trail Blazers lost.\n3. Determine if their record would be 6 - 3 if they lose this game. The Trail Blazers had a record of 5 wins and 2 losses before this game (since they won their first 5 games and lost the 6th one against the Cavaliers). If they lose to the home team, their record becomes 5 wins, 3 losses, which is not equal to 6 - 3.\n4. Since the Trail Blazers losing to the home team does not make their record 6 - 3, the claim is FALSE.\n\nanswer: \"FALSE\"\nrelevant_cells: [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": 'home'}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": 'score'}]",
