Next, we need to compare the number of wins on each surface to determine if there is a pattern that suggests Kamke plays better on one surface over the other.\n3. In this table, I cannot find any information about matches Kamke played on grass surfaces. Therefore, I will only consider hard and clay court matches.\n4. After examining the table, it appears that Kamke has won 0 matches on hard courts (as a runner-up does not count as a win) but has won 1 match on a clay court. This indicates that Kamke may have played better on clay courts compared to hard courts in these specific instances.\n5. However, since there is only one data point for clay and multiple for hard, it's important to note that this conclusion is based on a small sample size, which might not be representative of Kamke's overall performance.\n6. To draw a more definitive conclusion, we would need a larger dataset containing matches played on both surfaces.\n7. Since the question asks about whether Kamke plays better on clay than hard courts, and our analysis suggests that he may have played slightly better on clay based on this small sample, we can tentatively conclude that Kamke might play better on clay courts compared to hard courts.
