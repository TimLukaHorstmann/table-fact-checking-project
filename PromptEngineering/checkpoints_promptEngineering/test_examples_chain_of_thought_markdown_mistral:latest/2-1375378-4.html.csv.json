Search for a row in the table where the 'metric value' (which represents avoirdupois value) equals 361.206 lb. No such row is found, so we cannot directly associate the given weight with any specific Russian measurement from this table.\n3. However, there is an interesting pattern observed across rows: the ratio between the metric and avoirdupois values follows a consistent trend (ratio = 1 for funt, ratio = 1/32 for lot, etc.). This suggests that there may be a systematic relationship between Russian measurements and their corresponding avoirdupois equivalents.\n4. The row with the closest ratio to 1 is '\u0431\u0435\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0446' (berkovets) which has a ratio of 400.
