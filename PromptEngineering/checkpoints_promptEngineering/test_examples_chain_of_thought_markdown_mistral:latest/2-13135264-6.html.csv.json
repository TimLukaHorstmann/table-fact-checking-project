To do this, calculate the point gap for each game by subtracting the score of the visiting team from the home team's score. For example, in the first row, the point gap is 4 - 1 = 3 for Detroit vs Carolina.\n4. Compare these calculated point gaps to find instances where two different games have the same point gap value. This will indicate a tie for the largest point gap during the season.\n\nBased on my reasoning and analysis of the table, here's the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the 'score' column to calculate point gaps between teams.\",\n    \"Iterate through each row to find instances where the point gap is the same for different games.\",\n    \"Calculate the point gap by subtracting the score of the visiting team from the home team's score.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}",
