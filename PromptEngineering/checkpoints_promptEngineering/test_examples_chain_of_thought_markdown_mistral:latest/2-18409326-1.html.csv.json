Next, we count the number of stations playing this format. Since there is only one such station, it means there is exactly one classic rock station.\n3. Finally, since the claim asks for more than one, we compare the count of classic rock stations to a quantity greater than 1. In this case, since there is only one classic rock station, the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify all stations playing 'classic rock'.\",\n    \"Count the number of such stations.\",\n    \"Compare the count to a quantity greater than 1.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"format\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
