The relevant column names are \"season rank\".\n\n2. Extract the row_index values corresponding to these years, i.e., 2 (for 2002) and 3 (for 2007).\n\n3. Look at the values in the \"season rank\" column for each of the specified rows. The ranks are 9th (for 2002) and 69th (for 2007).\n\n4. Compare the two rank values: If a lower number is obtained when looking at the rank of the 2002 season row compared to the rank of the 2007 season row, then Greg Pursley ranked higher in 2002 than 2007. In this case, we see that the rank for 2002 (9th) is lower than the rank for 2007 (69th), so Greg Pursley did indeed rank higher in 2002 than 2007.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify relevant columns: 'season rank', find row indices for the given years, compare the ranks\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":2,\"column_name\":\"season rank\"},{\"row_index\":3,\"column_name\":\"season rank\"}]\n}",
