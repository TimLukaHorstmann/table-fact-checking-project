To verify if our initial assumption is correct, we need to check if there exists another source providing the participation and score of ivor bueb during those years.

    "resp": "Here are the steps in my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that Ivor Bueb raced a Cooper T51 chassis 2 times in 1959.\n\n2. Determine if there is any row that matches the conditions:\n   - Year = 1959 (since the claim specifically states this year)\n   - Chassis = Cooper t51 (as per the claim)\n\n3. Check all rows in the table to see if they match the conditions.\n\n4. If there are any matching rows, check how many times the specific chassis has been raced according to the points column. Since points are not assigned for a race, if the points column is 0, it means the car raced but did not receive any points, i.e., it raced.\n\n5. If there are multiple rows with the same chassis and no points, it would mean that the car raced more than once in that year.\n\n6. Compare the results from step 5 with the claim.\n\nBased on this reasoning, let's analyze the table:\n\n1. There are two rows for Cooper T51 (rows with index 4 and 5) in 1959.\n2. Both rows have 0 points, indicating that these cars raced but did not receive any points.\n3. Since there are two such rows, it means the car raced twice in 1959 as per the table.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Determine matching conditions\", \"Check all rows against conditions\", \"Compare results with the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}]\n}\n```",
