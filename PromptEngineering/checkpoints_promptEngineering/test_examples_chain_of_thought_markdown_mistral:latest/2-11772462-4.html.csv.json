    "resp": "Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Check each row to find out whether a team named 'washington' (the capital) played against either 'ny rangers' or 'carolina'.\n2. In the table, we can see that in rows 1 and 5, the 'visitor' is 'washington'. Also, in row 1, the 'home' is 'ny rangers', which means it was a game between these two teams.\n3. In this game, the score is shown as '0 - 2'. Since the first number corresponds to the number of goals scored by the visitor ('washington') and it's zero, this matches the claim that the capital had a score of 0 in this game.\n4. Furthermore, in row 5, we see that the home team is 'carolina', which means it was another game between these two teams. However, in this game, the score for the visitor ('washington') is not zero but '0 - 5'. This does not match the claim that the capital had a score of 0 in this game against Carolina.\n5. Since we have found evidence that supports the claim for one of the games and evidence that contradicts it for another game, we need to consider whether both pieces of evidence are relevant to the claim. The claim only specifies 'against ny ranger and the carolina', so both the game against the NY Rangers (where the score was 0 - 2) and the game against Carolina (where the score was not 0 but 0 - 5) should be considered.\n6. Based on the information given in the table, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE for the game against the NY Rangers but FALSE for the game against Carolina.

    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. To check the claim, we need to find out if Olaf Kolzig lost every game he played except for one (the November 6 game against Atlanta).\n2. We can do this by checking the \"decision\" column for each row where the \"visitor\" is Kolzig and comparing it with the opponent's goalkeeper listed in the same row.\n3. If the decision value is a loss (e.g., Washington - 1, 0 - 2, 1 - 2, etc.), we mark that game as a loss for Olaf Kolzig. Otherwise, we consider it a win or tie.\n4. We then count the number of losses and check if it matches the total games minus one (indicating a single exception).\n5. To make it easier to compare, let's first list all games with their corresponding decisions:\n   - November 1: Washington - Kolzig (L) vs NY Rangers (W)\n   - November 2: Philadelphia - (W) vs Washington - Kolzig (L)\n   - November 5: Washington - Kolzig (L) vs Carolina (L)\n   - November 6: Washington - Kolzig (W) vs Atlanta (D)\n   - November 8: Washington - Kolzig (W) vs Ottawa (W)\n   - November 10: Washington - Kolzig (L) vs Tampa Bay (L)\n   - November 15: Washington - Kolzig (L) vs Florida (L)\n   - November 16: Washington - Kolzig (L) vs Tampa Bay (L)\n   - November 19: Florida - (W) vs Washington - Kolzig (L)\n   - November 21: Atlanta - (W) vs Washington - Kolzig (L)\n   - November 23: Washington - Kolzig (L) vs Philadelphia (L)\n   - November 24: Carolina - (W) vs Washington - Kolzig (L)\n   - November 26: Buffalo - (W) vs Washington - Kolzig (L)\n   - November 28: Florida - (W) vs Washington - Kolzig (L)\n   - November 30: Washington - Kolzig (L) vs Carolina (L)\n6. Now we can count the number of losses and compare it with the total games minus one:\n   - Number of losses: 14 (all games except for the November 6 game against Atlanta)\n   - Total games: 17 (including the November 6 game against Atlanta)\n   - Difference: 17 - 14 = 3\n7.
