    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that in 2008, the Lord of the Rings musical was nominated for 5 Laurence Olivier Awards in 5 different categories.\n\n2. Check the table for relevant information: We need to find out if there are 5 rows (representing 5 awards) for a single musical production in 2008 and if those awards are in 5 different categories.\n\n3. Analyze the table data: Looking at the table, we see that all the entries are related to the Laurence Olivier Award and there is no clear indication of a specific musical production being nominated multiple times within the same year. However, it appears that Rob Howell was nominated in two categories (set design and costume design).\n\n4. Make an assumption: Since the table does not provide clear information about the musical production, we'll make an educated guess and assume that all the nominations belong to a single musical production, given the year and award are consistent throughout the table. In this case, we would expect 5 distinct categories for the musical if it was indeed nominated in 5 different categories.\n\n5. Check for 5 distinct categories: Looking at the table again, we see that there are only 4 distinct categories (best new musical, best set design, best costume design, and best lighting design), as sound design is not a unique category within this particular table.\n\n6. Compare the findings with the claim: Since we found 4 distinct categories for the nominations, our assumption that the Lord of the Rings musical was nominated in 5 different categories is FALSE. It appears that the table does not support the given claim as stated.\n\nOutput:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Check the table for relevant information\",\n    \"Analyze the table data\",\n    \"Make an assumption\",\n    \"Check for 5 distinct categories\",\n    \"Compare the findings with the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"award\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"category\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"category\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"category\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"category\" }\n  ]\n}",
