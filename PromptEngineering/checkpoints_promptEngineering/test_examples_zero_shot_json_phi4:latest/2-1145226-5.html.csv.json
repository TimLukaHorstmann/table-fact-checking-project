    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the data in the given table for each player's \"drop\" statistic and their corresponding span of years.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"the greatest number of drop from 1 player happen over the span of only 1 year.\"\n   - We need to find if there is a player who has the highest \"drop\" value and whose playing span is exactly one year.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Columns:**\n   - The relevant columns for this analysis are \"span\", \"start\", and \"drop\".\n   - \"Span\" will help us determine the number of years each player played.\n   - \"Drop\" gives the number of drop goals scored by each player.\n   - \"Start\" might be useful to verify if a single year span can be inferred.\n\n3. **Evaluate Each Player:**\n   - We need to look at each row in the data section and check the values for \"span\", \"start\", and \"drop\".\n\n4. **Data Analysis:**\n\n   - **Row 0:** \n     - Span: \"1992 - 2000\" (9 years)\n     - Drop: 0\n     - Not relevant as span is more than 1 year.\n   \n   - **Row 1:**\n     - Span: \"2003 - 2012\" (10 years)\n     - Drop: 0\n     - Not relevant as span is more than 1 year.\n\n   - **Row 2:**\n     - Span: \"2003 -\" (more than 1 year, exact end not specified)\n     - Drop: 0\n     - Not relevant as span is more than 1 year.\n\n   - **Row 3:**\n     - Span: \"2000 - 2007\" (8 years)\n     - Drop: 0\n     - Not relevant as span is more than 1 year.\n\n   - **Row 4:**\n     - Span: \"2007 -\" (more than 1 year, exact end not specified)\n     - Drop: 0\n     - Not relevant as span is more than 1 year.\n\n   - **Row 5:**\n     - Span: \"2007 -\" (more than 1 year, exact end not specified)\n     - Drop: 1\n     - Not relevant as span is more than 1 year.\n\n   - **Row 6:**\n     - Span: \"2002 - 2005\" (4 years)\n     - Drop: 0\n     - Not relevant as span is more than 1 year.\n\n   - **Row 7:**\n     - Span: \"2002 - 2009\" (8 years)\n     - Drop: 4\n     - Not relevant as span is more than 1 year.\n\n   - **Row 8:**\n     - Span: \"2003 - 2004\" (2 years)\n     - Drop: 0\n     - Not relevant as span is more than 1 year.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The highest drop value is 4 by Chris Wyles, but his span is more than 1 year.\n   - No player has a drop goal count over the span of exactly one year.\n\n6. **Determine the Answer:**\n   - Since no player meets the criteria of having the greatest number of drops in a single-year span, the claim is FALSE.\n\n7. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - We need to consider all rows for \"span\" and \"drop\" to verify the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"drop\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"drop\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"drop\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"drop\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drop\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"drop\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"drop\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drop\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"drop\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
