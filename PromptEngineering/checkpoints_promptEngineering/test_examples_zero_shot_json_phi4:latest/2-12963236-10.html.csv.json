    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim \"1990 - 01 - 28 be the kickoff date for the round of r4,\" we need to examine the table data and identify which entries pertain to this specific condition. The relevant information involves both the \"round\" and \"kick off\" columns.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:**\n   - The claim is about two pieces of information:\n     - The \"round\" being \"r4\".\n     - The \"kick off\" date being \"1990-01-28\".\n\n2. **Examine the Table for r4:**\n   - Locate rows where the \"round\" column equals \"r4\". There are two entries for round 4 in the data:\n     - Row index 3 has \"round\": \"r4\", \"kick off\": \"1990 - 01 - 28\".\n     - Row index 4 has \"round\": \"r4 replay\", \"kick off\": \"1990 - 01 - 31\".\n\n3. **Check the Kick Off Date:**\n   - From the identified rows, check if any of them have the \"kick off\" date as \"1990-01-28\".\n   - Row index 3 matches with both conditions: \"round\": \"r4\" and \"kick off\": \"1990 - 01 - 28\".\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is supported by the data. The relevant cells for verification are from row index 3 in the columns \"round\" and \"kick off.\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"kick off\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
