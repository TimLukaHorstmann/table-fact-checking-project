    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim about Jim Maloney and Marshall Bridges being pitchers in the 7th inning of a game, we must carefully analyze the relevant cells in the provided table:\n\n1. **Claim Breakdown**: \n   - The claim states that \"Jim Maloney (2) Marshall Bridges be the pitcher in the 7th inning of the game.\"\n   - This involves checking:\n     - Whether Jim Maloney and/or Marshall Bridges are mentioned as pitchers.\n     - If this event took place in the 7th inning.\n\n2. **Relevant Columns**:\n   - The columns relevant to verify the claim are \"pitcher\" (to check for names) and \"inn\" (to confirm the inning).\n\n3. **Verification Process**:\n   - We need to find an entry where both Jim Maloney and Marshall Bridges appear in the \"pitcher\" column, and the value of the \"inn\" column is \"7th\".\n\n4. **Data Examination**:\n   - For each row, we examine the \"pitcher\" and \"inn\" values.\n   \n5. **Row Analysis**:\n\n   - Row 0: \n     - \"pitcher\": \"jim maloney (2) marshall bridges\"\n     - \"inn\": \"7th\"\n     - This matches both criteria: Jim Maloney and Marshall Bridges are listed as pitchers, and it took place in the 7th inning.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The conditions specified in the claim are fully supported by row 0 of the table.\n   \nTherefore, the claim is TRUE, with relevant information found in row index 0 for both \"pitcher\" and \"inn\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pitcher\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"inn\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
