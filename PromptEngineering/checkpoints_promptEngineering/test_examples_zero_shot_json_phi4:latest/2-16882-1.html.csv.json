Again, we need to verify this for the same set of companies.\n\nLet's evaluate the relevant data from the table:\n\n- **Cygnific**:\n  - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n  - Group's Equity Shareholding: 100%\n  - Principal Activities: Sales and service\n\n- **Epcor**:\n  - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n  - Group's Equity Shareholding: 100%\n  - Principal Activities: Maintenance\n\n- **KLM Catering Services**:\n  - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n  - Group's Equity Shareholding: 100%\n  - Principal Activities: Catering services\n\n- **KLM Cityhopper**:\n  - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n  - Group's Equity Shareholding: 100%\n  - Principal Activities: Airline\n\n- **KLM Equipment Services**:\n  - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n  - Group's Equity Shareholding: 100%\n  - Principal Activities: Equipment support\n\n- **KLM Financial Services**:\n  - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n  - Group's Equity Shareholding: 100%\n  - Principal Activities: Financing\n\n- **KLM Flight Academy**:\n  - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n  - Group's Equity Shareholding: 100%\n  - Principal Activities: Flight academy\n\n- **KLM Health Services**:\n  - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n  - Group's Equity Shareholding: 100%\n  - Principal Activities: Health services\n\n- **Martinair**:\n  - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n  - Group's Equity Shareholding: 100%\n  - Principal Activities: Cargo airline\n\n- **Schiphol Logistics Park**:\n  - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n  - Group's Equity Shareholding: 53% (45% voting right)\n  - Principal Activities: Logistics\n\n- **TransaviaCom**:\n  - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n  - Group's Equity Shareholding: 100%\n  - Principal Activities: Airline\n\nFrom this analysis:\n\n- No company incorporated in the Netherlands has a group's equity shareholding of 99%.\n- Only KLM Flight Academy, which is incorporated in the Netherlands, has \"flight academy\" as its principal activities.\n\nSince neither condition (99% shareholding and flight academy) is met simultaneously for any company, the claim is false.\n\nHere is the relevant JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
