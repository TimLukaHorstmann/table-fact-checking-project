    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"vivo (ti scrivo) obtain higher point than croire\" is true or false, we need to identify and compare the points received by these two songs from the provided table.\n\n1. Locate the row for the song \"vivo (ti scrivo)\":\n   - This can be identified in the \"song\" column with the entry `vivo (ti scrivo)`.\n   - From the data, we find that this is in row index 17.\n   - The \"points\" column for this row has a value of 52.\n\n2. Locate the row for the song \"croire\":\n   - This can be identified in the \"song\" column with the entry `croire`.\n   - From the data, we find that this is in row index 16.\n   - The \"points\" column for this row has a value of 90.\n\n3. Compare the points:\n   - \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" received 52 points.\n   - \"croire\" received 90 points.\n\nThe claim states that \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" obtained higher points than \"croire.\" However, from our comparison, we see that \"croire\" actually obtained more points (90) compared to \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" (52).\n\nThus, the claim is false. The relevant cells in this context are:\n- Row 17, Column \"points\" for \"vivo (ti scrivo)\"\n- Row 16, Column \"points\" for \"croire\"\n\nThe JSON response reflecting this analysis would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
