Since the data seems to list opponents rather than players themselves, we will assume that the player referred to by \"Magdalena Maleeva\" is playing all matches.\n\nLet's review each row for matches played on clay:\n\n1. **Row 2**: Surface is \"clay\", Opponent is \"rachel mcquillan\".\n2. **Row 3**: Surface is \"clay\", Opponent is \"ruxandra dragomir\".\n3. **Row 4**: Surface is \"clay\", Opponent is \"park sung-hee\".\n4. **Row 5**: Surface is \"clay\", Opponent is \"florencia labat\".\n5. **Row 6**: Surface is \"clay\", Opponent is \"amanda coetzer\".\n6. **Row 7**: Surface is \"clay\", Opponent is \"lena korobova\".\n7. **Row 8**: Surface is \"clay\", Opponent is \"evgenia kulikovskaya\".\n8. **Row 9**: Surface is \"clay\", Opponent is \"kateryna bondarenko\".\n9. **Row 10**: Surface is \"clay\", Opponent is \"elena likhovtseva\".\n\nBy examining the rows, we find that there are multiple matches (specifically, nine) listed as played on a clay surface.\n\nSince Magdalena Maleeva's name does not appear explicitly in the opponent list and no additional context suggests otherwise, it is reasonable to assume these records represent her matches given the focus of the claim.\n\nThus, since she has played more than two matches on clay (as shown by multiple rows with \"clay\" in the `surface` column), the claim is false.\n\nHere's the JSON output reflecting this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"Magdalena Maleeva always played in the World Group I edition,\" we need to examine each row in the table provided and verify whether the player mentioned is Magdalena Maleeva and if she participated solely in matches within the \"World Group I\" edition. Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data Points:**\n   - We are specifically interested in the \"edition\" and \"opponent\" columns to evaluate this claim.\n   - For each row, check if \"Magdalena Maleeva\" is listed as the opponent.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row for Magdalena Maleeva:**\n   - Scan through all rows under the \"data\" array:\n     - Check if \"Magdalena Maleeva\" appears in any of the \"opponent\" entries.\n     - If she does, verify that those matches were played within an edition classified as \"World Group I.\"\n\n3. **Analysis of Data:**\n   - Upon checking all rows:\n     - There is no row with \"opponent\" listed as \"Magdalena Maleeva.\"\n   - Since there are no appearances of Magdalena Maleeva in the table, she did not play any match within this data set.\n\n4. **Conclusion on Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Magdalena Maleeva always played in World Group I editions.\n   - As there is no evidence (i.e., no rows with her name) of her participation in any edition, we cannot confirm she participated exclusively in World Group I or any other group within this dataset.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - Since Magdalena Maleeva does not appear at all, the claim that she always played in \"World Group I\" is not applicable. Therefore, the statement cannot be validated as true based on available data.\n   - Hence, the answer is \"FALSE\".\n\nHere's how this conclusion can be represented in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\nNo specific cells are relevant since Magdalena Maleeva does not appear in any row of the table.",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we must check if Petra Schmitt was indeed Magdalena Maleeva's opponent four times in this dataset.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: \n   - We need to look for entries where the \"opponent\" column has the name \"Petra Schmitt\".\n   - Then, we need to verify whether there are corresponding entries where \"Magdalena Maleeva\" appears as an \"opponent\" four times.\n\n2. **Search for Petra Schmitt's Matches**:\n   - From the dataset, locate any row where the \"opponent\" is \"Petra Schmitt\".
