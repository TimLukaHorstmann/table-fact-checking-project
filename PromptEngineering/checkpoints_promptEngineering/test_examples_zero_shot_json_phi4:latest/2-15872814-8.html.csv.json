    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the game in Atlanta, we must verify two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. The game against Atlanta should have ended with a score of \"w 109 - 101 (ot)\".\n2. Rafer Alston should have had 8 high assists for that game.\n\nLet's examine each condition step-by-step using the relevant data from the provided JSON structure.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify the Row for the Game in Atlanta:**\n   - We need to find the row where the \"team\" is \"atlanta\". By examining the table, we locate:\n     ```json\n     [\n       74,\n       \"april 8\",\n       \"atlanta\",\n       \"w 109 - 101 (ot)\",\n       \"jalen rose (30)\",\n       \"morris peterson (14)\",\n       \"rafer alston (8)\",\n       \"air canada centre 14352\",\n       \"31 - 44\"\n     ]\n     ```\n   - This corresponds to row index **4** in the data array.\n\n2. **Verify the Game Score:**\n   - The \"score\" column for this game is \"w 109 - 101 (ot)\", which matches exactly with the claim.\n\n3. **Check Rafer Alston's High Assists:**\n   - In the same row, under the \"high assists\" column, it states \"rafer alston (8)\".\n   - This confirms that Rafer Alston had 8 high assists in this game.\n\nBoth conditions required by the claim are satisfied based on the data. Thus, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells to verify these aspects are from row index **4** and include:\n- The \"team\" column to confirm it was against Atlanta.\n- The \"score\" column to check the game's outcome and score.\n- The \"high assists\" column for verifying Rafer Alston's assists.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"w 109 - 101 (ot) be the score on April 8,\" we need to examine two specific pieces of data from the table: the game played on April 8 and its corresponding score.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant row**: \n   - We start by looking for the row where the date is \"april 8\". According to the JSON data, this corresponds to row index 3 in the `data` array.\n\n2. **Verify the game details**:\n   - In row index 3, under the column \"date\", we find \"april 8\" which matches our date of interest.\n   - Next, check the \"score\" column for the same row (row index 3). It should contain \"w 109 - 101 (ot)\" to support the claim.\n\n3. **Compare with the provided information**:\n   - The value in the \"score\" column at row index 3 is indeed \"w 109 - 101 (ot)\", which matches exactly what the claim states.\n   \nSince both conditions are satisfied, we can confirm that the claim is true based on the data from the table.\n\nThus, the JSON object representing our conclusion and relevant cells for verification is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to identify if there is a game played on April 18 and compare its score with the specified score \"w 109 - 101 (ot)\" from another game.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Date:**\n   - We are looking for a game played on April 18 in the table data.\n\n2. **Check for Games on April 18:**\n   - Review each row to find an entry with \"april 18\" under the \"date\" column.\n   - Upon inspection, there is no entry with \"april 18\" in the provided dataset.\n\n3. **Compare Scores (if applicable):**\n   - The claim involves comparing scores from April 18 and another game on April 8 (\"w 109 - 101 (ot)\").\n   - Since there is no record for a game on April 18, we cannot perform any score comparison.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Without a game on April 18, the claim cannot be verified as true or false based on the available data.\n   - Therefore, the claim is considered FALSE because it assumes the existence of a game that does not exist in the dataset.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nSince there is no entry for April 18, we only need to consider the row with the score \"w 109 - 101 (ot)\" from April 8 to understand what is being compared against.\n\n- **Row Index and Column Name:**\n  - The game on April 8 corresponds to row index 3 in the data array.\n  - We focus on the \"score\" column for this comparison.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
