    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"england cone time the most point against argentina\" is true or false, we need to break down and analyze the components of this statement.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim:**\n   - The claim seems to suggest that England scored the most points against Argentina.\n   - However, there is a typographical error in \"cone time.\" We interpret it as \"conceded the most points\" meaning England allowed Argentina to score more points than any other opposing team has done for Argentina.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Table:**\n   - The table includes columns such as \"opposing teams,\" \"against,\" \"date,\" \"venue,\" and \"status.\"\n   - To verify if England conceded the most points against Argentina, we need to look at the rows where \"Argentina\" is listed under the \"opposing teams\" column.\n\n3. **Relevant Data from Table:**\n   - Locate the row with Argentina as the opposing team:\n     - Row index 8: \n       - Opposing Team: Argentina\n       - Points Against: 0 (This indicates points conceded by England to Argentina)\n       - Date: 25/11/2000\n       - Venue: Twickenham, London\n       - Status: Test match\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - From the data in row index 8, England conceded 0 points against Argentina.\n   - Since 0 is the lowest possible score and not the highest, the claim that England \"conceded the most points\" is false.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - We only need to check the cells from row index 8 under columns \"opposing teams\" and \"against.\"\n\nThe final JSON output based on this analysis would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opposing teams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
