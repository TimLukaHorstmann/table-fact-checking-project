    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Rijeka's outgoing manager was Nenad Gra\u010dan,\" we need to identify relevant information from the table about Rijeka's outgoing manager.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row**: First, locate the row associated with the team \"Rijeka.\"\n\n2. **Check the Outgoing Manager Column**: Once the correct row is identified, examine the \"outgoing manager\" column for that row to see if it matches \"Nenad gra\u010dan.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Locate Rijeka's Row**:\n   - The table data shows a team named \"rijeka.\"\n   - This corresponds to the last entry in the provided data (row index 5).\n\n2. **Verify Outgoing Manager for Rijeka**:\n   - In row index 5, under the column \"outgoing manager,\" the name is listed as \"nenad gra\\u010dan.\"\n   - The escape sequence \"\\u0107\" represents the character \"\u010d\". Therefore, \"nenad gra\\u010dan\" translates to \"Nenad Gra\u010dan.\"\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the outgoing manager for Rijeka is indeed Nenad Gra\u010dan, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cell for verifying this claim is in row index 5 under the column \"outgoing manager.\"\n\nThe JSON response reflecting this analysis is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the relevant parts of the provided table:\n\n#### Claim:\n\"Ivan Pudar from team Hrvatski Dragovoljac be the outgoing manager for mutual consent.\"\n\nWe will check each condition in this claim against the data in the JSON table:\n\n1. **Manager Name: Ivan Pudar**\n2. **Team: Hrvatski Dragovoljac**\n3. **Manner of Departure: Mutual Consent**\n\n#### Steps to Verify:\n- We need to find a row where the \"team\" is \"hrvatski dragovoljac.\"\n- Within that row, check if the \"outgoing manager\" is \"ivan pudar.\"\n- Then verify that the \"manner of departure\" for this outgoing manager is \"mutual consent.\"\n\n#### Examination of Table:\n1. Look at each row where the team name matches \"hrvatski dragovoljac\":\n   - **Row 4**: Team is \"hrvatski dragovoljac,\" Outgoing Manager is \"damir bi\u0161kup,\" Manner of Departure is \"removed from position.\"\n   - **Row 5**: Team is \"hrvatski dragovoljac,\" Outgoing Manager is \"ivan pudar,\" Manner of Departure is \"removed from position.\"\n   - **Row 6**: Team is \"hrvatski dragovoljac,\" Outgoing Manager is \"ivan pudar,\" Manner of Departure is \"mutual consent.\"\n\n2.
