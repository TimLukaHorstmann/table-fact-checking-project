This column contains information about sets and potentially tie-breaks (in case of a 6-8 format) which can help determine the number of games.\n\n2. **Extract Data for Each Year:**\n   - For each entry, we will examine the \"year\" and corresponding \"score in the final\" to compute the total number of games played.\n   \n3. **Calculate Total Games:**\n   - Each set score in tennis is typically noted as (6-x), with x being the number of games won by the opponent. If a tie-break occurred, it's usually indicated as 7-6(x) or 8-6(x).\n   - Compute total games for each final:\n     - **1942:** Don Budge vs. Unknown\n       - Score: \"2-6, 2-6, 2-6\" \u2192 Games = (4+3) + (4+3) + (4+3) = 21 games.\n     - **1946:** Don Budge\n       - Score: \"6-3, 6-1, 6-1\" \u2192 Games = (7+4) + (7+2) + (7+2) = 29 games.\n     - **1947:** Don Budge\n       - Score: \"3-6, 6-3, 10-8, 4-6, 6-3\" \n         - For the third set with a score of \"10-8\", it's a tie-break set: Games = (5+6) + (7+5) + (9+8) + (4+7) + (7+4) = 61 games.\n     - **1948:** Jack Kramer\n       - Score: \"12-14, 2-6, 6-3, 3-6\" \n         - For the first set with a score of \"12-14\", it's an extended set: Games = (14+13) + (4+7) + (7+5) + (5+7) = 73 games.\n     - **1949 (Wembley Pro):** Jack Kramer\n       - Score: \"6-2, 4-6, 3-6, 4-6\" \u2192 Games = (7+5) + (6+7) + (5+7) + (6+7) = 50 games.\n     - **1949 (US Pro):** Don Budge\n       - Score: \"9-7, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5\" \n         - For the first set with a score of \"9-7\", it's an extended set: Games = (11+10) + (6+7) + (7+5) + (8+6) = 60 games.\n\n4. **Determine Maximum Number of Games:**\n   - The number of games for each championship is:\n     - 1942: 21 games\n     - 1946: 29 games\n     - 1947: 61 games\n     - 1948: 73 games (maximum)\n     - 1949 (Wembley): 50 games\n     - 1949 (US Pro): 60 games\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the most number of games were played in the 1947 championship, but from our calculations, the 1948 championship had the highest number of games played (73 games).\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - We need cells for \"year\" and \"score in the final\" to perform these calculations.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the only game that be play on an indoor surface be play before 1946,\" we need to examine the table data for matches played on an indoor surface and their corresponding years.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Indoor Matches:**\n   - We look at the \"surface\" column to find entries labeled as \"indoor.\"\n\n2. **Check the Year of Each Indoor Match:**\n   - For each match identified as \"indoor,\" we check its year from the \"year\" column.\n\n3. **Verify Against the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that if any indoor game is played, it must be before 1946.\n   - We need to ensure there are no entries with an \"indoor\" surface for years 1946 or later.\n\n### Examination of Data:\n\n- **Row 0:** \n  - Surface: Grass\n  - Year: 1942\n  - Not relevant as it is not indoor.\n\n- **Row 1:** \n  - Surface: Grass\n  - Year: 1946\n  - Not relevant as it is not indoor.\n\n- **Row 2:** \n  - Surface: Grass\n  - Year: 1947\n  - Not relevant as it is not indoor.\n\n- **Row 3:** \n  - Surface: Grass\n  - Year: 1948\n  - Not relevant as it is not indoor.\n\n- **Row 4:** \n  - Surface: Indoor\n  - Year: 1949\n  - Relevant because it's an indoor match and the year is after 1946.\n\n- **Row 5:** \n  - Surface: Grass\n  - Year: 1949\n  - Not relevant as it is not indoor.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that any game played on an indoor surface should be before 1946. However, there is a match in row 4 played on an indoor surface in the year 1949, which contradicts the claim.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Bobby Riggs win against Jack Kramer in the final\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table, we need to analyze the data provided.\n\nThe claim consists of two parts:\n1. Bobby Riggs won.\n2. The opponent was Jack Kramer.\n3. This occurred in a final match.\n\nWe will verify these conditions by examining the relevant columns: \"outcome,\" \"opponent in the final,\" and possibly \"pro slam championship\" to ensure it's a final event.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **Check for Bobby Riggs as a winner**:\n   - We need to find any row where \"Bobby Riggs\" is listed as having an \"outcome\" of \"winner.\"\n\n2. **Check if the opponent was Jack Kramer**:\n   - In those rows identified in step 1, check if \"Jack Kramer\" is listed under \"opponent in the final.\"\n\n3. **Ensure it's a final match**:\n   - The table does not explicitly mention whether these are finals or semi-finals, but since they are labeled as \"pro slam championship,\" we assume these matches are finals.\n\nNow, let's go through the data:\n\n- Row 0: Outcome is \"runner-up\" (not relevant).\n- Row 1: Winner is against Don Budge (not Bobby Riggs; not relevant).\n- Row 2: Winner is against Don Budge (not Bobby Riggs; not relevant).\n- Row 3: Runner-up against Jack Kramer (Bobby Riggs didn't win here; not relevant).\n- Row 4: Runner-up against Jack Kramer (Bobby Riggs didn't win here; not relevant).\n- Row 5: Winner is against Don Budge (not Bobby Riggs; not relevant).\n\nNo row in the table shows Bobby Riggs as a winner, and none lists Jack Kramer as an opponent in a final match won by Bobby Riggs.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim \"Bobby Riggs win against Jack Kramer in the final\" is FALSE.
