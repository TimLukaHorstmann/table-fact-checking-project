    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to evaluate two main conditions from it:\n\n1. **\"There be only 7 games in all the game\":**  \n   - This condition is about verifying if each row in the data represents a situation where exactly 7 games have been played.\n   - The relevant column for this check is \"games\", and we need to ensure every entry under this column equals 7.\n\n2. **\"On 4 occasions be there draw with never more than 1 game drawn\":**  \n   - This condition involves checking the number of rows where a draw has occurred (\"drawn\" column) and ensuring that it happens exactly 4 times, with each occurrence having at most 1 draw.\n   - The relevant column for this check is \"drawn\", and we need to count how many times the value in this column is greater than 0. Additionally, those values must not exceed 1.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions based on the data provided:\n\n### Step-by-step Evaluation\n\n#### Condition 1: Games Played\n- Check each row under the \"games\" column:\n  - Row 0: games = 7\n  - Row 1: games = 7\n  - Row 2: games = 7\n  - Row 3: games = 7\n  - Row 4: games = 7\n  - Row 5: games = 7\n  - Row 6: games = 7\n  - Row 7: games = 7\n\nAll rows confirm that exactly 7 games have been played, satisfying the first part of the claim.\n\n#### Condition 2: Draws Occurrences\n- Check each row under the \"drawn\" column to count how many times a draw has occurred:\n  - Row 0: drawn = 0 (no draw)\n  - Row 1: drawn = 0 (no draw)\n  - Row 2: drawn = 1 (one draw)\n  - Row 3: drawn = 1 (one draw)\n  - Row 4: drawn = 1 (one draw)\n  - Row 5: drawn = 0 (no draw)\n  - Row 6: drawn = 1 (one draw)\n  - Row 7: drawn = 0 (no draw)\n\nDraws occur in rows 2, 3, 4, and 6. This totals exactly 4 occasions with each occurrence having no more than 1 game drawn, satisfying the second part of the claim.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth conditions from the claim are fully supported by the data:\n\n- There are indeed only 7 games played in all rows.\n- There are exactly 4 instances where a draw occurs, and each has at most 1 drawn game.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two conditions based on the provided table:\n\n1. There should be exactly 10 points on two occasions.\n2. For these occasions where there are 10 points, the \"points difference\" must be either \"30 - 15\" or \"26 - 21\".\n\nLet's examine each row in the data column by column for relevance to the claim:\n\n- **Column \"games\":** This column contains only numbers representing the number of games played and is not relevant to verifying the claim.\n  \n- **Column \"drawn\":** Represents the number of drawn matches. Also irrelevant to the points or points difference.\n\n- **Column \"lost\":** Indicates the number of lost matches, which does not help verify the claim either.\n\n- **Column \"points difference\":** This column needs to be checked against the specified values \"30 - 15\" and \"26 - 21\".\n\n- **Column \"points\":** We need to check where this equals 10 for two occasions as per the claim.\n\nNow, let's go through each row of data:\n\n1. Row 0: Points = 14 (Not relevant)\n2. Row 1: Points = 10, Points Difference = \"26 - 16\" (Relevant due to points being 10 but not matching required differences)\n3. Row 2: Points = 9 (Not relevant)\n4. Row 3: Points = 9 (Not relevant)\n5. Row 4: Points = 7 (Not relevant)\n6. Row 5: Points = 4 (Not relevant)\n7. Row 6: Points = 3 (Not relevant)\n8. Row 7: Points = 0 (Not relevant)\n\nFrom the above analysis, there is only one occurrence of 10 points in row 1 with a \"points difference\" of \"26 - 16\", not matching either \"30 - 15\" or \"26 - 21\". Therefore, the claim that there are 10 points on two occasions and those occurrences have specific differences does not hold true.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are in row 1 for both \"points difference\" and \"points\".\n\nFinal JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
