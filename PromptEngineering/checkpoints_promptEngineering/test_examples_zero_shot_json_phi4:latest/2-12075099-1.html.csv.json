    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's carefully analyze the given information.\n\n### Claim:\n\"rattler be the opponent team at the bishop kearney field\"\n\nThe relevant aspects of this claim require us to focus on two main elements from the table: \n1. The \"opponent\" being \"Rattlers\".\n2. The \"field\" being \"bishop kearney field\".\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with \"opponent\":** \n   - We need to locate any row where the opponent is specified as \"rattlers\". \n\n2. **Check the \"field\" for those rows:**\n   - For each identified row, we need to check if the field matches \"bishop kearney field\".\n\n### Analysis of the Table:\n\nLet's examine the relevant rows in the table data.\n\n- **Row 6:**\n  - Date: July 9\n  - Opponent: Rattlers\n  - Home / Away: away\n  - Field: bishop kearney field\n  - Result: w 26 - 15\n\nThis row meets both conditions specified by the claim:\n- The opponent is \"Rattlers\".\n- The field is \"bishop kearney field\".\n\n- **Row 7:**\n  - Date: July 14\n  - Opponent: Rattlers\n  - Home / Away: home\n  - Field: villanova stadium\n  - Result: l 10 - 14\n\nThis row does not meet the condition of being at \"bishop kearney field\", although it has the opponent as \"Rattlers\".\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is supported by Row 6 where both conditions are satisfied.

However, let's also verify the location to be thorough:\n\nFinally, we check the field name for this date:\n- Field: \"villanova stadium\"\n\nThe field condition also fails as it is not \"bishop kearney field.\"\n\nSince both conditions (opponent and field) do not match the claim, we can definitively conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere are the relevant cells used to verify the claim:\n\n1.
