    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to check two specific pieces of information in the table for the year 1980:\n\n1. **Record**: The claim states that they finish with a record of \"18 - 12\". We need to verify this against the \"record\" column for the year 1980.\n2. **Seed**: The claim also mentions receiving an \"11 seed\". We must check this against the \"seed\" column for the same year.\n\nWe will locate the row corresponding to the year 1980 and examine these two columns:\n\n- **Row Index**: Since the data is given in chronological order, we can identify the first entry as the year 1980. This corresponds to `row_index` 0.\n- **Record Verification**: For the row at `row_index` 0, the \"record\" column should contain \"18 - 12\".\n- **Seed Verification**: For the same row, the \"seed\" column should contain \"11\".\n\nUpon checking:\n\n- The \"record\" for 1980 is indeed \"18 - 12\", which matches the claim.\n- However, the \"seed\" for 1980 is \"12\", not \"11\" as claimed.\n\nSince one part of the claim (the seed) does not match the table data, the entire claim is false. We need to return the relevant cells that were checked:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"seed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to check the relevant data from the provided table for the year 1996 and verify if it matches the conditions in the claim.\n\n1. **Claim Conditions:**\n   - Year should be 1996.\n   - The seed should be 2.\n   - The region should be southeast.\n\n2. **Table Analysis:**\n   - We need to find the row corresponding to the year 1996 in the table.\n   - Check the values for \"seed\" and \"region\" columns for that specific year.\n\n3. **Checking Relevant Data:**\n\n   From the data:\n   - Row with `year` = 1996 has:\n     - `\"record\": \"24 - 9\"`\n     - `\"seed\": 12`\n     - `\"region\": \"southeast\"`\n\n4. **Verification Against Claim:**\n   - The claim states that in 1996, they were the 2 seed of the southeast region.\n   - However, the data shows:\n     - Seed is `12`, not `2`.\n     - Region is correctly `southeast`.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the seed value does not match the claim (it should be 2 but is actually 12), the claim is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells to Verify Claim:**\n   - Row index for the year 1996 is `5` (zero-based indexing).\n   - Relevant columns are \"seed\" and \"region\".\n\nTherefore, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"seed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"region\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
