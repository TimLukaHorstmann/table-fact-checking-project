    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down each part of the claim and verify it against the table data for season 1991.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n\n1. **\"during season 1991\"**: \n   - We need to locate row corresponding to \"1991\".\n\n2. **\"west indies be the holder at the end of the series\"**:\n   - Check if \"holder at the end of the series\" is \"west indies\" for the 1991 season.\n\n3. **\"the host england be 5 and have the result of series drawn\"**:\n   - Verify that \"host\" is \"england\".\n   - Confirm that \"tests\" (number of matches) is 5.\n   - Check if \"series result\" is \"series drawn\".\n\n### Verification:\n\n1. **Locating Season 1991:**\n   - The row for season 1991 corresponds to the third item in the \"data\" array, which has a `row_index` of 13 (0-based index).\n\n2. **Holder at the End of the Series:**\n   - For `row_index` 13, the value under \"holder at the end of the series\" is \"west indies\".\n\n3. **Host and Tests:**\n   - For `row_index` 13, the \"host\" is indeed \"england\".\n   - The number of tests (matches) for this row is 5.\n\n4. **Series Result:**\n   - For `row_index` 13, the \"series result\" is \"series drawn\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAll parts of the claim are supported by the table data:\n- The host was England.\n- There were 5 tests in the series.\n- The series result was drawn.\n- West Indies held the title at the end of the series.\n\nTherefore, the entire claim is true. The relevant cells for verification include those related to \"host\", \"tests\", \"series result\", and \"holder at the end of the series\" for season 1991 (row index 13).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"host\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"tests\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"series result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"holder at the end of the series\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
