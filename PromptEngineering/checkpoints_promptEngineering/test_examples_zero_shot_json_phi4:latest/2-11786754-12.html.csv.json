    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, we must evaluate it based on the conditions provided:\n\n### Claim:\n\"5.3 be the average that have more than 0 touchdown and more than 135 yard\"\n\n### Conditions to Check:\n1. **More than 0 touchdowns**: This involves examining the \"td's\" column.\n2. **More than 135 yards**: This involves examining the \"yards\" column.\n\nWe need to check each row in the data to see if it satisfies both conditions (more than 0 touchdowns and more than 135 yards). If a player meets these criteria, we then verify if their average (from the \"avg\" column) is 5.3.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Rob Turner**: \n   - Yards = 171 (> 135)\n   - Td's = 4 (> 0)\n   - Avg = 10.6\n\n2. **Lenzie Jackson**:\n   - Yards = 171 (> 135)\n   - Td's = 0 (not > 0)\n\n3. **Kevin Ingram**: \n   - Yards = 135 (= 135, not > 135)\n   - Td's = 1 (> 0)\n\n4. **Robert Quiroga**:\n   - Yards = 16 (< 135)\n   - Td's = 2 (> 0)\n\n5. **Terrence Stubbs**:\n   - Yards = 12 (< 135)\n   - Td's = 0 (not > 0)\n\n6. **Josh Jeffries**:\n   - Yards = 58 (< 135)\n   - Td's = 3 (> 0)\n\n### Relevant Rows:\n\n- Only **Rob Turner** satisfies both conditions of having more than 0 touchdowns and more than 135 yards.\n- His average is 10.6, not 5.3.\n\nThus, the claim that \"5.3 be the average\" for players with more than 0 touchdowns and more than 135 yards is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row index for Rob Turner: 0\n  - Columns: \"yards\", \"td's\", \"avg\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"yards\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"td 's\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"avg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
