    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"during the 2008 - 09 Real Madrid CF season, Garc\u00eda and Agus both have loan return,\" we need to evaluate specific conditions against the provided table:\n\n1. **Identify Players**: We must locate entries for players named \"Garc\u00eda\" and \"Agus\" in the table.\n2. **Check Transfer Type**: Their transfer type should be \"loan return.\"\n3. **Transfer Window Alignment**: The transfer window should either relate to or encompass the 2008 - 09 season (commonly, summer refers to post-season transfers for the next year).\n4. **Temporal Constraints**: We need any temporal reference that matches with the 2008-09 season.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1. **Locate \"Garc\u00eda\" and \"Agus\":**\n   - Garc\u00eda is found in row index 5.\n   - Agus is found in row index 7.\n\n2. **Check Transfer Type:**\n   - For Garc\u00eda (row 5), the type is \"loan return.\"\n   - For Agus (row 7), the type is also \"loan return.\"\n\n3. **Transfer Window Alignment:**\n   - Both players have a transfer window listed as \"summer,\" which typically implies a post-season transfer, meaning these transfers would be relevant for the upcoming season starting in August 2009.\n   \n4. **Temporal Constraints:**\n   - There are no specific years listed for Garc\u00eda and Agus, only that their end is \"undisclosed.\" However, since both have a \"summer\" window, they could relate to any summer transfer period leading into a new season, including 2008-09.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the absence of specific years but the alignment with a \"summer\" transfer window for both players, it's plausible that these transfers could be related to the 2008-09 season.

Both players are from France.\n2. They were involved with Real Madrid during the 2008-09 season.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant information from the table:\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1. **Check Nationality:**\n   - We need to find entries for \"Lass\" and \"Faubert\" in the \"name\" column.\n   - For each, check if their nationality (\"nat\") is \"fra\" (France).\n\n2. **Verify Involvement with Real Madrid during 2008-09:**\n   - The table does not explicitly mention club names or seasons for each transfer/loan.\n   - We need to verify the timing of transfers or loans and see if it aligns with the 2008-09 season.\n\n### Relevant Data from Table\n\n1. **Lass:**\n   - Found in row 10:\n     - \"name\": \"lass\"\n     - \"nat\": \"fra\" (French)\n     - \"transfer window\": \"winter\"\n     - \"ends\": \"2013\"\n\n2. **Faubert:**\n   - Found in row 12:\n     - \"name\": \"faubert\"\n     - \"nat\": \"fra\" (French)\n     - \"type\": \"loan\"\n     - \"transfer window\": \"winter\"\n     - \"ends\": \"2009\"\n\n### Verification\n\n- **Nationality Check:**\n  - Both Lass and Faubert are from France (\"nat\": \"fra\").\n\n- **Timing with Real Madrid:**\n  - The table does not specify the club involved in these transfers or loans.\n  - Faubert's loan ends in 2009, which could align with the 2008-09 season.\n  - However, without explicit mention of Real Madrid, we cannot confirm their involvement with this club during that season.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe table does not provide information about the club involved in these transfers or loans. Therefore, we cannot conclusively verify if both players were associated with Real Madrid during the 2008-09 season based solely on the data provided.\n\nThus, the claim is **FALSE** due to insufficient evidence regarding their association with Real Madrid.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"nat\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"nat\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
