    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, let's break down and analyze each part of the claim using the provided table.\n\n**Claim Breakdown:**\n\n1. **\"dave stockton earn less money than lee trevino in 2002\":**\n   - We need to compare the \"earnings\" for Dave Stockton and Lee Trevino.\n   - From the table:\n     - Dave Stockton (row index 3) has earnings of 9,735,814.\n     - Lee Trevino (row index 4) has earnings of 9,616,404.\n   - Therefore, Dave Stockton earns more than Lee Trevino, not less.\n\n2. **\"but have 15 more win\":**\n   - We need to compare the \"wins\" for Dave Stockton and Lee Trevino.\n   - From the table:\n     - Dave Stockton (row index 3) has 14 wins.\n     - Lee Trevino (row index 4) has 29 wins.\n   - The difference in wins is 15, but Lee Trevino has more wins than Dave Stockton. Thus, Dave Stockton does not have 15 more wins.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- The first part of the claim is FALSE because Dave Stockton earns more than Lee Trevino.\n- The second part of the claim is also FALSE because Dave Stockton does not have 15 more wins; in fact, he has fewer.\n\nSince neither condition of the claim holds true, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- For earnings comparison:\n  - Row index 3, \"earnings\" for Dave Stockton.\n  - Row index 4, \"earnings\" for Lee Trevino.\n- For wins comparison:\n  - Row index 3, \"wins\" for Dave Stockton.\n  - Row index 4, \"wins\" for Lee Trevino.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
