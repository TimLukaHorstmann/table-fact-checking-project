    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to assess if the opponent for the first time in the 11th week was indeed the New Orleans Saints.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant data point**: We focus on row index 10 in the \"data\" array because it corresponds to the 11th week (as indexing starts from 0).\n\n2. **Check the opponent for Week 11**:\n   - The \"opponent\" column at row index 10 is `\"new orleans saints\"`.\n\n3. **Verify if this was the first time playing against them during the season**:\n   - We need to check all previous weeks (rows 0 through 9) and confirm that \"new orleans saints\" does not appear in any of those rows under the \"opponent\" column.\n   - Row indices 0-9 have opponents as follows: \n     - Week 1: Tennessee Oilers\n     - Week 2: Kansas City Chiefs\n     - Week 3: Atlanta Falcons\n     - Week 4: New York Jets\n     - Week 5: St Louis Rams\n     - Week 6: San Diego Chargers\n     - Week 8: Denver Broncos\n     - Week 9: Seattle Seahawks\n     - Week 10: Carolina Panthers\n     - Week 11: New Orleans Saints\n\n   Since \"new orleans saints\" only appears in week 11, this confirms it is their first encounter.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"the new orleans saint be the opponent for the first time in the 11th week\" is TRUE.
