Determine Pitchers vs. Non-Pitchers\n- The positions that indicate a pitcher are \"lhp\" (left-handed pitcher) and \"rhp\" (right-handed pitcher).\n- All other positions are considered non-pitchers.\n\n#### 2. Examine Each Player's Position:\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Name: Pat Harrison\n  - Position: INF (Infielder, a non-pitcher)\n  \n- **Row 2**: \n  - Name: William Camp\n  - Position: RHP (Right-handed Pitcher)\n\n- **Row 3**: \n  - Name: George Pugh\n  - Position: LHP (Left-handed Pitcher)\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Name: William Ferguson\n  - Position: 1B (First Baseman, a non-pitcher)\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Name: George Putz\n  - Position: 1B (First Baseman, a non-pitcher)\n\n#### 3.
