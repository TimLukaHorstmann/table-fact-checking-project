    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"during the 2007 - 08 Minnesota Wild season, Minnesota play at home more times than they play away,\" we need to count the number of games played at home versus those played away based on the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Columns**:\n   - The relevant columns for this analysis are \"visitor\" and \"home\".\n   - When a team is listed under \"visitor\", it indicates an away game.\n   - When a team is listed under \"home\", it indicates a home game.\n\n2. **Count Home Games**:\n   - Count the number of rows where \"minnesota\" appears in the \"home\" column.\n   \n3. **Count Away Games**:\n   - Count the number of rows where \"minnesota\" appears in the \"visitor\" column.\n\n### Analysis of the Data:\n\n- **Home Games**: \n  - Rows where \"minnesota\" is listed under \"home\":\n    - February 5\n    - February 7\n    - February 9\n    - February 10\n    - February 12\n    - February 14\n    - February 17\n    - February 19\n    - February 20\n    - February 24\n    - February 26\n    - February 27\n    - February 29\n  \n  Total home games = 13\n\n- **Away Games**:\n  - Rows where \"minnesota\" is listed under \"visitor\":\n    - February 2\n    - February 5 (already counted as home)\n  \n  Total away games = 1\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nMinnesota played more games at home (13) than away (1) during the specified period. Thus, the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells are those in the \"visitor\" and \"home\" columns for each row that contains a game involving Minnesota.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
