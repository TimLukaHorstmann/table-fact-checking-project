    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the andrean fighting '59ers have an enrollment of 587\" is true or false, we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. The school name should be \"andrean\".\n2. The enrollment number for that school should be 587.\n\nLet's go through the relevant cells in the table to check these conditions:\n\n- **Row 0**:\n  - **Column \"school\"**: The value is \"andrean\", which matches the school mentioned in the claim.\n  - **Column \"enrollment\"**: The value is 587, which matches the enrollment number specified in the claim.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied with the data from row 0. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- Row index 0, Column name \"school\"\n- Row index 0, Column name \"enrollment\"\n\nNow, let's format this information into a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
