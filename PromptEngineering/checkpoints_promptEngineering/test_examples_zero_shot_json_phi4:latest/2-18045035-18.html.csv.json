Thus, this part of the claim is also false.\n\n3. **\"The highest long be 58 by Doug Hague\":**  \n   - The \"long\" column contains: 45, 82, 39, 32, 58, 24, 9, 20.\n   - The highest value in this list is 82 (Doug Hogue), not 58. Thus, the claim about Doug Hague having the highest \"long\" with a value of 58 is false.\n\n4. **\"The lowest long be 20 by Andrew Robinson\":**  \n   - Again checking the \"long\" column: 45, 82, 39, 32, 58, 24, 9, 20.\n   - The lowest value in this list is 9 (Andrew Robinson), not 20. Therefore, this part of the claim is false.\n\nSince all parts of the claim are incorrect based on the data provided, the overall answer to the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow let's identify the relevant cells for verification:\n\n- **Gain Check:**\n  - Highest gain should be checked at Curtis Brinkley (row_index 0) and Doug Hogue (row_index 1).\n  - Lowest gain should be checked at Rob Long (row_index 5) and Andrew Robinson (row_index 6).\n\n- **Long Check:**\n  - Highest long should be checked at Doug Hogue (row_index 1) and Tony Fiammetta (row_index 4).\n  - Lowest long should be checked at Andrew Robinson (row_index 6) and Cam Dantley (row_index 7).\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"long\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"long\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"long\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"long\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
