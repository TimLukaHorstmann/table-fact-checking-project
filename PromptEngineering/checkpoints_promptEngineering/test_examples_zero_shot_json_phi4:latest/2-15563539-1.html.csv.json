However, John H Vandenbosch being Treasurer on the Socialist Ticket is correct.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe relevant cells for verification are:\n- For John H Vandenbosch: Row 5, Column \"socialist ticket.\"\n- For George K Shuler: Row 0, Column \"democratic ticket.\"\n\nGiven that one part of the claim is false, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"socialist ticket\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"democratic ticket\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify two specific pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. Whether George R Lunn is on the Democratic ticket for the position of Lieutenant Governor.\n2. Whether Franklin P Brill is on the Workers ticket for the same position.\n\nLet's break down these steps using the provided JSON structure:\n\n- **Table Structure**: The table is organized with \"columns\" listing different offices and tickets, and \"data\" providing the corresponding candidates for each office under each ticket.\n\n- **Identifying Relevant Rows**:\n  - We need to locate George R Lunn and Franklin P Brill in the table. Since they are associated with the position of Lieutenant Governor (as mentioned in the claim), we focus on the row where \"Lieutenant Governor\" is listed as the office.\n  \n- **Locating Data for Verification**:\n  - The first column contains office names. We find that \"lieutenant governor\" appears at index 1 in this list, which corresponds to row index 1 in the data array (since indexing starts at 0).\n\n- **Checking Democratic Ticket**:\n  - In row index 1 of the data array under the column \"democratic ticket\", we check if it lists \"george r lunn\".\n\n- **Checking Workers Ticket**:\n  - Similarly, in the same row index but under the column \"workers ticket\", we verify that it lists \"franklin p brill\".\n\nBy examining the table:\n\n- For row index 1 (Lieutenant Governor):\n  - Column \"democratic ticket\" contains \"george r lunn\".\n  - Column \"workers ticket\" contains \"franklin p brill\".\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied.
