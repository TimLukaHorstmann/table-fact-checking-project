    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim \"in 2003, the Washington Redskins played a 17-week schedule with 1 bye,\" we need to examine the provided table data.\n\n### Analyzing the Table Data\n\n1. **Number of Weeks**: The table has columns labeled from \"week\" 1 through 17, indicating there are 17 weeks represented in the dataset.\n\n2. **Games and Bye Week**:\n   - Each row corresponds to a game or a bye week.\n   - We need to count how many rows have valid data for games (i.e., non-empty opponent names and results) versus those that indicate a bye week (empty cells).\n\n3. **Identifying the Bye Week**:\n   - Row 8 has all columns marked as \"-\", indicating it is a bye week.\n\n4. **Counting Game Weeks**:\n   - Rows with valid game data are from weeks 1 through 7, and weeks 9 through 17.\n   - This totals to 15 weeks of games (7 weeks before the bye week and 8 weeks after).\n\n### Verifying the Claim\n\n- The claim states there is a total of 17 weeks with 1 bye. From our analysis:\n  - There are indeed 17 weeks in the table.\n  - Only one row (week 8) is identified as a bye week.\n  - This leaves 16 weeks accounted for games, but we see only 15 valid game entries due to an error or oversight in the table's data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is partially correct regarding the number of weeks and the presence of one bye. However, it inaccurately reflects the number of actual game weeks (should be 16 instead of 17).\n\nThus, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification\n\n- Row indices where games are played or a bye week occurs:\n  - Week 1 to 7: Valid games\n  - Week 8: Bye week\n  - Week 9 to 17: Valid games\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
