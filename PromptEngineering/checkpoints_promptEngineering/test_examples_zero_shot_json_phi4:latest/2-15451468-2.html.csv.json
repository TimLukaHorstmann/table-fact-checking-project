    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down the claim and match it against the data in the table.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n\"The New Orleans Saints played before Week 7 at Tulane Stadium.\"\n\n1. **Identify when the New Orleans Saints are mentioned:**\n   - Look for \"New Orleans Saints\" in the \"opponent\" column.\n\n2. **Verify if this game occurred before Week 7:**\n   - Check that the corresponding \"week\" is less than 7.\n\n3. **Confirm the location was Tulane Stadium:**\n   - Ensure the \"game site\" for this match is \"Tulane Stadium\".\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. Locate the entry with \"New Orleans Saints\":\n   - The entry is in Row Index 2, where:\n     - Week = 3\n     - Opponent = \"new orleans saints\"\n     - Game Site = \"tulane stadium\"\n\n2. Check if this game occurred before Week 7:\n   - Since the week number is 3, it indeed occurs before Week 7.\n\n3. Confirm that the game site was Tulane Stadium:\n   - The game site is listed as \"tulane stadium\", which matches the claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe conditions in the claim are fully supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the answer is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
