The notation \"(from [team])\" suggests that this is a trade, and if it says nothing like this, the pick is directly for the Ottawa Senators.\n\n2. **Check Nationality:** \n   - For each relevant row, examine the \"nationality\" column to determine if the player is American or non-American (i.e., not from the United States).\n\n3. **Count and Compare:**\n   - Count how many of these draft picks are from players who are non-Americans.\n   - Determine if this count constitutes a majority.\n\n**Analysis of the Table:**\n\n- Row 0: Jared Cowen, Nationality: Canada (non-American)\n- Row 1: Jakob Silfverberg, Nationality: Sweden (non-American)\n- Row 2: Robin Lehner, Nationality: Sweden (non-American)\n- Row 3: Chris Wideman, Nationality: United States\n- Row 4: Mike Hoffman, Nationality: Canada (non-American)\n- Row 5: Jeff Costello, \"from boston via phoenix\" implies he wasn't picked directly by the Senators.\n- Row 6: Corey Cowick, Nationality: Canada (non-American)\n- Row 7: Brad Peltz, Nationality: United States\n- Row 8: Michael Sdao, \"from edmonton\" implies he wasn't picked directly by the Senators.\n\n**Relevant Rows for Ottawa Senators Draft Picks:**\n- Row 0: Jared Cowen\n- Row 4: Mike Hoffman\n- Row 6: Corey Cowick\n\n**Count of Nationalities in Relevant Rows:**\n- Non-American: 3 (Canada)\n- American: 0\n\nSince all three relevant draft picks by the Ottawa Senators are non-Americans, this constitutes a majority.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim \"the majority of draft pick in 2009 for the ottawa senator be non - american\" is TRUE.

There were 9 draft picks by Ottawa.\n3. 3 of these draft picks were acquired via trade.\n\nLet's break down each condition:\n\n### Condition 1: Team Identification\n- **Ottawa**: We need to verify if any player listed as a pick by Ottawa has been mentioned in the table with Ottawa being their club team or associated through trades.\n\n### Condition 2: Number of Draft Picks\n- The total number of draft picks made by Ottawa should be 9. This is straightforward from the claim itself.\n\n### Condition 3: Trades for Picks\n- We need to identify which picks were acquired via trade and ensure that at least 3 such picks are involved in trades with other teams.\n\n#### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Ottawa's Picks**:\n   - From the table, we have one direct mention of \"Ottawa\" associated with player Corey Cowick:\n     - Row 6: \"corey cowick\", round 6, overall 160, club team \"ottawa 67 's (ohl)\".\n\n2. **Check for Trades**:\n   - We need to find any indication of trades involving Ottawa.\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 5 mentions a player acquired via trade: Jeff Costello, \"(from boston via phoenix)\", indicating he was traded from Boston through Phoenix before being picked by this team.\n     - Row 7 has Michael Sdao, \"191 (from edmonton)\", indicating he was acquired via trade with Edmonton.\n\n3. **Count the Trades**:\n   - Two players are noted as acquired via trades: Jeff Costello and Michael Sdao.\n   - We need to find one more traded pick attributed to Ottawa to satisfy the claim of 3 traded picks.\n\n4. **Verification Against Conditions**:\n   - While we have identified two trades, we do not have a third explicitly linked to Ottawa in the data provided.\n   - There is no further evidence in the table indicating that any additional players were acquired via trade by Ottawa.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- We only found 2 picks (Jeff Costello and Michael Sdao) acquired via trades. Since the claim states \"3 of Ottawa's 9 2009 draft picks were acquired via trade,\" we do not have sufficient evidence to support this statement based on the table data provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"club team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"less than half of the draft pick play on the left wing\" is true or false, we need to evaluate the data in the table with respect to the player positions.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Identify Total Number of Draft Picks:**\n   - Count all entries under the \"round\" column to get the total number of players drafted.\n   \n2. **Determine Players Playing as Left Wing (LW):**\n   - Examine the \"position\" column for each player and identify those with \"lw\" in their position.\n\n3. **Calculate Proportion:**\n   - Compute the proportion of players who play left wing (LW) relative to the total number of draft picks.\n\n4. **Evaluate Claim:**\n   - If the number of LW players is less than half of the total draft picks, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Total Number of Draft Picks:**\n   - The \"round\" column lists 9 entries (rows 0 to 8), indicating there are 9 players drafted in total.\n\n2. **Identify LW Players:**\n   - From the \"position\" column:\n     - Row 0: Jared Cowen, position is \"d\".\n     - Row 1: Jakob Silfverberg, position is \"rw / lw\". (Includes LW)\n     - Row 2: Robin Lehner, position is \"g\".\n     - Row 3: Chris Wideman, position is \"d\".\n     - Row 4: Mike Hoffman, position is \"c / lw\". (Includes LW)\n     - Row 5: Jeff Costello, position is \"lw\". \n     - Row 6: Corey Cowick, position is \"lw\".\n     - Row 7: Brad Peltz, position is \"lw\".\n     - Row 8: Michael Sdao, position is \"d\".\n\n   - LW players are in rows 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"more than half of Ottawa's draft picks were acquired by trade\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table provided in JSON format.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Draft Picks for Ottawa:**\n   - We first look for any entries that mention \"Ottawa 67's (OHL)\" as this indicates a pick associated with Ottawa.\n   - From the data:\n     - Corey Cowick is listed with \"ottawa 67 's (ohl)\" in column \"club team\".\n\n2. **Determine if These Picks Were Acquired by Trade:**\n   - We need to check if any of these picks have an indication that they were acquired via trade.\n   - This can be identified by looking for text like \"(from ...)\" or similar notations in the \"overall\" column, which indicates a trade.\n   - Corey Cowick's pick is listed as \"160\", with no mention of being traded.\n\n3. **Count and Compare:**\n   - Ottawa has 1 draft pick mentioned in the table.\n   - None of these picks indicate they were acquired by trade (no \"(from ...)\" notation).\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - Since there is only one draft pick for Ottawa, and none are marked as acquired via trade, it is impossible for more than half of Ottawa's draft picks to have been acquired by trade.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because none of Ottawa's draft picks were acquired by trade. Therefore, less than half (in fact, zero) of their picks were obtained through trades.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cells are those related to the player Corey Cowick from \"Ottawa 67's\" since he is the only pick associated with Ottawa in the table.\n- These cells include his position in the overall draft and his club team.\n\nHere is the JSON object reflecting this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"club team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Check how many rounds these players were picked in.\n3. Verify if there are two picks in more than half of those rounds.\n\nLet's go through the table:\n\n- **Round 1**: No entry for Ottawa Senators.\n- **Round 2**: No entry for Ottawa Senators.\n- **Round 4**: No entry for Ottawa Senators.\n- **Round 5**: No entry for Ottawa Senators.\n- **Round 6**: \n  - Player: Corey Cowick\n  - Club Team: \"ottawa 67's (ohl)\"\n  - This is one pick in round 6.\n- **Round 7**:\n  - Players: Brad Peltz, Michael Sdao\n  - Club Teams: Neither mentions Ottawa Senators.\n\nFrom this analysis:\n\n- The Ottawa Senators have only one draft pick in round 6 and none in the other rounds.\n- There are no rounds where the Ottawa Senators had two picks.\n- Therefore, they do not meet the condition of having two draft picks in more than half of the rounds (since they only participated in one round with a single pick).\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Row 5: \"corey cowick\" entry confirms one pick in round 6.\n- All other rows confirm no additional picks by Ottawa Senators.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"club team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
