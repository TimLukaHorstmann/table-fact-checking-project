    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding Rodney Stuckey leading the Detroit Pistons in point scoring during this period of the 2010-2011 season, we need to analyze the \"high points\" column for each game.\n\nThe relevant condition in the claim is that Rodney Stuckey should be listed as the player with the highest points scored in two different games. We will examine each row's data under the \"high points\" column and identify which players are recorded as having the highest points in each game.\n\nLet's go through the data:\n\n1. **Game 62**: High Points - Rodney Stuckey (25)\n2. **Game 63**: High Points - Austin Daye (22)\n3. **Game 64**: High Points - Tayshaun Prince (20)\n4. **Game 65**: High Points - Richard Hamilton (20)\n5. **Game 66**: High Points - Richard Hamilton (20)\n6. **Game 67**: High Points - Chris Wilcox (21)\n7. **Game 68**: High Points - Rodney Stuckey (24)\n8. **Game 69**: High Points - Tayshaun Prince (16)\n9. **Game 70**: High Points - Rodney Stuckey (22)\n10. **Game 71**: High Points - Richard Hamilton (27)\n11. **Game 72**: High Points - Richard Hamilton, Tayshaun Prince (15)\n12. **Game 73**: High Points - Richard Hamilton (23)\n\nFrom this analysis:\n- In Game 62, Rodney Stuckey leads with 25 points.\n- In Game 68, Rodney Stuckey leads with 24 points.\n- In Game 70, Rodney Stuckey leads again with 22 points.\n\nRodney Stuckey is recorded as the player leading in points in Games 62, 68, and 70. Therefore, he led the Detroit Pistons in scoring for three games during this period, not just two as stated in the claim.\n\nThus, the claim that Rodney Stuckey led the team in point scoring in two games is actually an understatement, as it occurs in three games. The claim is therefore TRUE since the condition of leading in at least two games is met.\n\nRelevant rows and column for verification:\n- Row 0, Column \"high points\"\n- Row 7, Column \"high points\"\n- Row 9, Column \"high points\"\n\nThe JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The relevant column for determining wins or losses is \"score\".\n\n2. **Check Each Game**:\n   - March 6, vs Washington: Detroit won by 11 points (113 - 102).\n   - March 16, vs Toronto: Detroit won by 14 points (107 - 93).\n   - March 18, vs New York: Detroit won by 4 points (99 - 95), not more than 10.\n   - March 26, vs Indiana: Detroit won by 12 points (100 - 88).\n\n3. **Count Wins Over 10 Points**: From the above analysis:\n   - The Pistons won against Washington and Toronto with margins over 10 points.\n   - They also won against Indiana with a margin of 12 points.\n\nThus, there are three games where Detroit won by more than 10 points during this period, not four as claimed.

Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Extract Attendance Data:**\n   - For each row corresponding to a game between March 1 and March 26, extract the attendance figure from the \"location attendance\" column.\n\n2. **Identify the Lowest Attendance:**\n   - Compare all extracted attendance figures to find the minimum value.\n   - Identify which date (and game) corresponds to this lowest attendance.\n\n3. **Verify Claim Details:**\n   - Check if the identified lowest attendance matches the claim that it occurred on March 20 against Atlanta at Philips Arena with an attendance of 17,580.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- Extracted Attendance Values:\n  - March 1: 11364\n  - March 2: 13122\n  - March 6: 17506\n  - March 9: 18581\n  - March 11: 18203\n  - March 12: 19155\n  - March 16: 15166\n  - March 18: 22076\n  - **March 20: 17580**\n  - March 23: 22076\n  - March 25: 19907\n  - March 26: 19216\n\n- Lowest Attendance:\n  - The lowest attendance figure is 11364 on March 1 against Milwaukee at the Bradley Center.\n\nSince the lowest attendance (11,364) occurred on March 1 against Milwaukee and not on March 20 against Atlanta, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells for verifying this are those containing attendance data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
