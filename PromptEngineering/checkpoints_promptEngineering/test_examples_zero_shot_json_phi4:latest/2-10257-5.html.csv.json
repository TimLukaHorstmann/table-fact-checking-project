    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two parts:\n1. All games listed were played at Kardinia Park except for one in 1924.\n2. The exception in 1924 was held at MCG.\n\nLet's analyze each entry:\n\n- **1922**: Venue is \"mcg\".\n- **1924**: Competition is marked as \"did not play\", so there's no venue to consider here.\n- **1932**: Venue is \"mcg\".\n- **1949**: Venue is \"mcg\".\n- **1951**: Venue is \"mcg\".\n- **1953**: Venue is \"mcg\".\n- **1971**: Venue is \"mcg\".\n- **1981**: Venue is \"mcg\".\n- **1996**: Venue is \"mcg\".\n- **1998**: Venue is \"mcg\".\n\nFrom this analysis:\n- All games that were played (i.e., not marked as \"did not play\") occurred at MCG.\n- The 1924 entry is an exception but only because the game was not played; it does not contradict the claim about venues.\n\nThe claim states that all venues are Kardinia Park except for 1924, which should be at MCG. However, the data shows all played games were at MCG, and 1924 had no venue due to cancellation.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells:\n- All entries where \"venue\" is specified (except for 1924 as it was not played).\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
