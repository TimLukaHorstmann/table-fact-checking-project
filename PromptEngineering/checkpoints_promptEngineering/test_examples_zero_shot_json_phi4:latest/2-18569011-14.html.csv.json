    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two main pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. Whether the athlete \"visa hongisto\" belongs to Finland.\n2. Whether this athlete is in lane number 9.\n\nLet's break down the verification process:\n\n- **Verification of Athlete and Nationality**:\n  - We look for an entry with the athlete name \"visa hongisto\".\n  - According to the data, there is an entry with \"athlete\" as \"visa hongisto\" and \"nationality\" as \"finland\". This confirms that Visa Hongisto is indeed from Finland.\n\n- **Verification of Lane Number**:\n  - For the same entry where \"visa hongisto\" is listed, we check the \"lane\".\n  - The data shows that \"visa hongisto\" is in lane number 3.\n  \nSince the claim states that \"visa hongisto from finland be in lane number 9\", but our verification shows that he is actually in lane number 3, the claim is false.\n\nThus, we identify two relevant cells for this verification:\n- The cell with \"athlete\" as \"visa hongisto\".\n- The corresponding cell with his \"nationality\" and \"lane\".\n\nBased on these observations, we construct the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"athlete\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lane\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
