    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to analyze the specific parts of the table relevant to the statement: \"paulistano lost as many games as s\u00edrio drew.\"\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Teams and Columns**:\n   - We are interested in two teams: \"paulistano\" and \"s\u00edrio\".\n   - For these teams, we need to look at the number of games they have lost and drawn respectively.\n   - The relevant columns for this comparison are:\n     - \"lost\" (for \"paulistano\")\n     - \"drawn\" (for \"s\u00edrio\")\n\n2. **Extract Data from Table**:\n   - Locate the row corresponding to each team:\n     - \"paulistano\" is at index 3 in the data array.\n     - \"s\u00edrio\" is at index 2 in the data array.\n\n3. **Retrieve Values for Comparison**:\n   - For \"paulistano\":\n     - Row index: 3\n     - Column: \"lost\"\n     - Value: 6 (indicating they lost 6 games)\n   \n   - For \"s\u00edrio\":\n     - Row index: 2\n     - Column: \"drawn\"\n     - Value: 4 (indicating they drew 4 games)\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that \"paulistano lost as many games as s\u00edrio drew.\"\n   - According to the data, \"paulistano\" lost 6 games and \"s\u00edrio\" drew 4 games.\n   - Since 6 is not equal to 4, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Compile Relevant Cells for JSON**:\n   - For \"paulistano\" (lost): `{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}`\n   - For \"s\u00edrio\" (drawn): `{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}`\n\nBased on the analysis above, here is the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
