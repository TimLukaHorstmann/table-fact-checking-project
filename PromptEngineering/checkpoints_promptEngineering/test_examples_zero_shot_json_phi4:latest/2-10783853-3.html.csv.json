    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"neither St Kilda nor Fitzroy get to play at Brunswick Street Oval,\" we need to examine the relevant data in the table.\n\nThe table is structured with columns: \"home team,\" \"home team score,\" \"away team,\" \"away team score,\" \"venue,\" \"crowd,\" and \"date.\" The claim focuses on whether either St Kilda or Fitzroy play at Brunswick Street Oval. Therefore, we are interested in checking:\n\n1. If either team (St Kilda or Fitzroy) is listed as the \"home team\" or \"away team\" for a match played at \"Brunswick Street Oval.\"\n\nLet's analyze the data row by row:\n\n- **Row 0:**\n  - Home Team: Fitzroy\n  - Away Team: St Kilda\n  - Venue: Brunswick Street Oval\n\nIn this row, we find that both Fitzroy and St Kilda are involved in a match at Brunswick Street Oval. This directly contradicts the claim.\n\nSince we found evidence in Row 0 that both teams do play at Brunswick Street Oval, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
