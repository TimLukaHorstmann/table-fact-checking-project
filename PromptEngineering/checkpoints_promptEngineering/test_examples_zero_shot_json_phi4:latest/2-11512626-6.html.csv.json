The claim has two components:\n\n1. On August 30, Mohler (1 - 10) took the loss.\n2. On August 31, Oquist (2 - 5) suffered the loss.\n\nLet's verify each part against the data in the table:\n\n- **August 30**: \n  - From the \"date\" column, find the row where the date is \"august 30\".\n  - Check the \"loss\" column for that row to see if it contains \"mohler (1 - 10)\".\n  - The relevant entry in the table is:\n    ```\n    [\n      \"august 30\",\n      \"athletics\",\n      \"4 - 3\",\n      \"mohler (1 - 10)\",\n      48308,\n      \"67 - 70\"\n    ]\n    ```\n  - This confirms that Mohler indeed took the loss with a record of (1 - 10).\n\n- **August 31**:\n  - From the \"date\" column, find the row where the date is \"august 31\".\n  - Check the \"loss\" column for that row to see if it contains \"oquist (2 - 5)\".\n  - The relevant entry in the table is:\n    ```\n    [\n      \"august 31\",\n      \"athletics\",\n      \"10 - 4\",\n      \"oquist (2 - 5)\",\n      48041,\n      \"68 - 70\"\n    ]\n    ```\n  - This confirms that Oquist indeed suffered the loss with a record of (2 - 5).\n\nBoth parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table.

There are no other dates in August with attendance less than 20,000.\n\nLet's examine the relevant data from the table:\n\n- **August 4**: The attendance is 15,230.\n- **August 5**: The attendance is 16,428.\n\nBoth of these figures are indeed less than 20,000, which supports the first part of the claim.

The pitcher with the record \"(6 - 6)\" in our data appears on August 27th against the Reds, not on August 25th.\n  \n- Additionally, there's no game mentioned against the Rockies on that date within the provided dataset.\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n- **ReMLINGER** was not involved in any game listed for August 25th.\n- The outcome did not include ReMLINGER taking a win on this date.\n- There is no game involving the Rockies on August 25th, which contradicts the claim's mention of an opponent.\n\nConclusively, the claim does not align with the table data. Therefore, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is \"FALSE\". The relevant cells that were checked are:\n\n1. Row index for date and opponents (August 25 entries).\n2. Entries in the \"loss\" column on August 25th.\n\nHere's the JSON object summarizing this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"loss\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
