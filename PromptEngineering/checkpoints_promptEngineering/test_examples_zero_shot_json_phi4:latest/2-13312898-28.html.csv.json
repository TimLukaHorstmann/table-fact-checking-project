Check if Curtis Dickey was picked in Round 2.\n2. Check if Randy Bielski was picked in Round 2.\n\nLet's examine each player's details from the data given:\n\n### Curtis Dickey\n- According to the first row of the \"data\" array:\n  - `round`: 1\n  - `name`: \"curtis dickey\"\n\nCurtis Dickey was picked in Round 1, not Round 2.\n\n### Randy Bielski\n- According to the last row (13th entry) of the \"data\" array:\n  - `round`: 12\n  - `name`: \"randy bielski\"\n\nRandy Bielski was picked in Round 12, not Round 2.\n\nSince neither Curtis Dickey nor Randy Bielski were picked in Round 2, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nWe need to identify the relevant cells for verification:\n- For Curtis Dickey: Row index 0, \"round\"\n- For Randy Bielski: Row index 12, \"round\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
