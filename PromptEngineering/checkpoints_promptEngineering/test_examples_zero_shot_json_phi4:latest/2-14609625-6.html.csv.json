Identify players whose \"average\" is less than 2.6.\n2. Check if these players have exactly 1 touchdown.\n\nLet's analyze each row in the data:\n\n1. **Player: stephen davis**\n   - Average: 4.0\n   - Touchdowns: 11\n   - The average is not less than 2.6, so this player does not meet the condition for further checking touchdowns.\n\n2. **Player: larry centers**\n   - Average: 5.4\n   - Touchdowns: 0\n   - The average is not less than 2.6, so this player does not meet the condition for further checking touchdowns.\n\n3. **Player: james thrash**\n   - Average: 8.2\n   - Touchdowns: 0\n   - The average is not less than 2.6, so this player does not meet the condition for further checking touchdowns.\n\n4. **Player: skip hicks**\n   - Average: 2.7\n   - Touchdowns: 1\n   - The average is not less than 2.6, so this player does not meet the condition for further checking touchdowns.\n\n5. **Player: brad johnson**\n   - Average: 2.6\n   - Touchdowns: 1\n   - The average is not less than 2.6 (it is equal to 2.6), so this player does not meet the condition for further checking touchdowns.\n\nAfter evaluating all players, no player has an \"average\" strictly less than 2.6. Therefore, there are no relevant players to check for having exactly 1 touchdown under the specified condition.\n\nSince no player meets the condition of having an average less than 2.6, we cannot find any instance where a player with such an average has exactly 1 touchdown. Thus, the claim is not supported by the data.\n\nThe final JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
