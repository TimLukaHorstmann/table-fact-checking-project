    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim about the table provided in JSON format, we need to examine two key components:\n\n1. Whether Steve Jones is the only player from the United States.\n2. Whether he is the only player with a total score of 154.\n\nLet's break down these components using the relevant data from the table:\n\n### Step 1: Verify if Steve Jones is the only player from the United States\n\n- **Steve Jones** is indeed listed as being from the United States, which matches part of our claim.\n- We need to check all players in the table to see if any other player is also from the United States.\n\nChecking each row:\n- Row 0: Player \"Ernie ELS\" - Country: South Africa\n- **Row 1**: Player \"Fuzzy Zoeller\" - Country: United States\n- **Row 2**: Player \"Curtis Strange\" - Country: United States\n- **Row 3**: Player \"Jack Nicklaus\" - Country: United States\n- **Row 4**: Player \"Steve Jones\" - Country: United States\n- **Row 5**: Player \"Hale Irwin\" - Country: United States\n\nFrom this, we can see that Steve Jones is not the only player from the United States. There are other players listed (Fuzzy Zoeller, Curtis Strange, Jack Nicklaus, and Hale Irwin) who are also from the United States.\n\n### Step 2: Verify if Steve Jones is the only player with a total of 154\n\n- **Row 4**: Steve Jones has a total score of 154.\n- We need to check all other rows to see if any other player has this same total score.\n\nChecking each row:\n- Row 0: Total score = 148\n- Row 1: Total score = 151\n- Row 2: Total score = 152\n- Row 3: Total score = 153\n- **Row 4**: Total score = 154 (Steve Jones)\n- Row 5: Total score = WD (Withdrew, not a numerical total)\n\nFrom this analysis, Steve Jones is indeed the only player with a total score of 154.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that \"Steve Jones be the only player from the United States and the only player with a total of 154.\" Based on our examination:\n- The first part of the claim (\"only player from the United States\") is false because there are other players from the United States.\n- The second part of the claim (\"only player with a total of 154\") is true.\n\nSince both parts must be true for the entire claim to be true, and one part is false, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells that support this conclusion are:\n- Row indices 1, 2, 3, and 5 under \"country\" (to verify other U.S. players).\n- Row index 4 under \"total\" to confirm Steve Jones' total of 154.\n  \nHere is the final JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
