    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim about the table provided in JSON format, let's analyze each component of the claim step by step:\n\n1. **Year**: The claim specifies \"in 2007\". We need to focus on the column labeled as \"fy07 millions\" which represents the fiscal year 2007 revenue from casinos.\n\n2. **Smallest Revenue**: The claim asserts that Elko had the smallest revenue in 2007, amounting to 283 million dollars.\n\n3. **County and Revenue Check**:\n   - We need to verify if Elko indeed had a revenue of 283 million dollars in 2007.\n   - Additionally, we must check other counties' revenues in 2007 to confirm that Elko's was the smallest.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n- **Elko's Revenue**: \n  - Locate the row where the county is \"elko\".\n  - Check the value in the \"fy07 millions\" column for this row.\n  - For Elko (3rd row, index 2), the revenue is 324 million dollars.\n\n- **Compare with Other Counties**:\n  - Clark: In the first row (index 0), the revenue is 10538 million dollars.\n  - Washoe: In the second row (index 1), the revenue is 1045 million dollars.\n  - South Lake Tahoe: In the fourth row (index 3), the revenue is 283 million dollars.\n  - Carson Valley: In the fifth row (index 4), the revenue is 120 million dollars.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim states that Elko had the smallest revenue with 283 million, but in reality:\n  - Elko's actual revenue was 324 million, not 283 million.\n  - South Lake Tahoe had a revenue of 283 million, which is less than Elko's and smaller than any other county except Carson Valley (120 million).\n\nTherefore, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Elko's revenue in 2007: Row index 2, Column \"fy07 millions\"\n- South Lake Tahoe's revenue in 2007: Row index 3, Column \"fy07 millions\" (to show it had a smaller amount than claimed for Elko)\n- Carson Valley's revenue in 2007: Row index 4, Column \"fy07 millions\" (it actually has the smallest revenue)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"fy07 millions\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"fy07 millions\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"fy07 millions\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
