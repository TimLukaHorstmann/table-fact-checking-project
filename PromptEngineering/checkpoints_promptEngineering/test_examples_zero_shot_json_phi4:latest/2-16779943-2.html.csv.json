A \"W\" at the beginning means a win for the Bengals.\n\n3. **Count Wins**: \n   - Go through each entry and count how many times the result starts with \"w\".\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - If there are exactly 3 wins, then the claim is TRUE.\n   - Otherwise, the claim is FALSE.\n\nLet's apply this to the data:\n\n- Row 0: Result = \"l 20 - 28\" (Loss)\n- Row 1: Result = \"l 10 - 27\" (Loss)\n- Row 2: Result = \"l 28 - 31\" (Loss)\n- Row 3: Result = \"l 13 - 20\" (Loss)\n- Row 4: Result = \"l 7 - 23\" (Loss)\n- Row 6: Result = \"l 10 - 14\" (Loss)\n- Row 7: Result = \"l 13 - 37\" (Loss)\n- Row 8: Result = \"l 20 - 23\" (Loss)\n- **Row 9**: Result = \"w 20 - 17\" (Win)\n- **Row 10**: Result = \"w 34 - 31\" (Win)\n- Row 11: Result = \"l 13 - 17\" (Loss)\n- Row 12: Result = \"l 13 - 15\" (Loss)\n- Row 13: Result = \"l 15 - 38\" (Loss)\n- Row 14: Result = \"l 20 - 27\" (Loss)\n- Row 15: Result = \"l 7 - 28\" (Loss)\n- **Row 16**: Result = \"w 33 - 30\" (Win)\n\nThe Bengals won in rows 9, 10, and 16.
