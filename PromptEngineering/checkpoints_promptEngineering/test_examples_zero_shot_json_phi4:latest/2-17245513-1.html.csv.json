    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to examine specific pieces of information in the provided table:\n\n1. The claim states that Peter Oosterhuis is at place \"t7\". We need to check if his entry has the \"place\" value as \"t7\".\n2. It also claims he wins \"$7500\". We need to verify if his \"money\" column matches this amount.\n\nLet's break down these steps using the table data:\n\n- Peter Oosterhuis is listed in row index 7 (considering zero-based indexing) with:\n  - Place: \"t7\"\n  - Money: \"$7500\"\n\nThe relevant cells that we need to check are from row index 7. Specifically, they pertain to the columns \"place\" and \"money\".\n\n1. For the \"place\" column at row 7, the value is \"t7\", which matches the claim.\n2. For the \"money\" column at row 7, the value is \"$7500\", also matching the claim.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied by checking these specific cells in the table. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nHere's the JSON response reflecting this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about Peter Oosterhuis in the provided table, we need to verify two main conditions:\n\n1. **Position Check:** Ensure that \"t7\" is indeed the place of player Peter Oosterhuis.\n2. **Money Amount Check:** Verify whether Peter Oosterhuis has a monetary value of 10875.\n\nLet's examine these step-by-step using relevant cells from the table:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Peter Oosterhuis' Position\n- Locate Peter Oosterhuis in the data:\n  - Row index 7 contains \"Peter oosterhuis\", with columns showing:\n    - Place (\"place\"): t7\n    - Money (\"money\"): 7500\n  \nThis confirms that his position is indeed \"t7\".\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Monetary Value for Peter Oosterhuis\n- For monetary value, check the \"money\" column in Row index 7:\n  - The recorded money for Peter Oosterhuis is 7500.\n\nThe claim states he has a monetary amount of 10875. However, from the table, we observe it's actually 7500.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on these checks:\n\n- **Position Condition:** TRUE (Peter Oosterhuis is at \"t7\").\n- **Monetary Amount Condition:** FALSE (He does not have 10875 but rather 7500).\n\nSince both conditions must be true for the claim to hold, and one condition fails, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells used in this verification are:\n- Row index 7, column \"place\" for verifying his position as \"t7\".\n- Row index 7, column \"money\" for verifying the monetary amount of 7500 instead of 10875.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
