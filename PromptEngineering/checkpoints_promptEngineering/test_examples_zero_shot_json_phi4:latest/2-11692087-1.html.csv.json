They have accumulated a total of 1177 points over these 45 seasons.\n\nLet's examine the relevant data in the table:\n\n- According to the row labeled \"total,\" there are indeed \"45 seasons\" listed, which corresponds to part one of the claim.\n  \n- The same \"total\" row shows that they have made \"1177 points.\" This matches exactly with part two of the claim.\n\nThus, both conditions required for the claim to be true are satisfied by the data in the \"total\" row. We will focus on this specific row and relevant columns:\n\n- Row index for the \"total\" row is 45 (as it's the last row before summarizing).\n- The relevant column names are \"season,\" \"team name,\" and \"points.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"the coquitlam adanacs have made 1177 points over 45 seasons\" is supported by the data. The relevant cells for verification include:\n\n1. Row index 45, Column \"season\": to verify the number of seasons.\n2. Row index 45, Column \"team name\": ensures consistency with the team in question.\n3.
