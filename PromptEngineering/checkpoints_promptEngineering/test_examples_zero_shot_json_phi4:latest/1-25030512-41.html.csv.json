We find only one incumbent (Mark Critz) who was not re-elected, and his situation is noted twice in the table, which still counts as a single event of not being re-elected.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since there is only one instance where an incumbent did not get re-elected, the claim that all but two incumbents were re-elected is false because it should state \"all but one\" instead.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant cells are those related to the outcomes in Pennsylvania 12 and all other rows for cross-verification of re-election status.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Mark Critz did not lose renomination; rather, he lost in the general election to a Republican opponent. Therefore, only one incumbent (Jason Altmire) did not win their party's renomination.\n\nThe claim states that \"only 2 incumbents for Pennsylvania do not win their party's renomination,\" but we found only one such case. Thus, the claim is false.\n\nHere is the relevant JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"only 4 incumbent house representatives for Pennsylvania were first elected before 2000,\" we need to examine the data in the table provided and focus on the relevant columns: \"incumbent\", \"first elected\", and \"district\" (to ensure they pertain to Pennsylvania). The task is to count how many incumbents listed have their \"first elected\" year prior to 2000.\n\nLet's analyze each row:\n\n1. **Pennsylvania 1**: Bob Brady, first elected in 1998.\n2. **Pennsylvania 5**: Glenn Thompson, first elected in 2008.\n3. **Pennsylvania 6**: Jim Gerlach, first elected in 2002.\n4. **Pennsylvania 7**: Pat Meehan, first elected in 2010.\n5. **Pennsylvania 9**: Bill Shuster, first elected in 2000.\n6. **Pennsylvania 10**: Tom Marino, first elected in 2010.\n7. **Pennsylvania 11**: Lou Barletta, first elected in 2010.\n8. **Pennsylvania 12** (Mark Critz): Mark Critz, first elected in 2010.\n9. **Pennsylvania 12** (Jason Altmire): Jason Altmire, first elected in 2006.\n10. **Pennsylvania 13**: Allyson Schwartz, first elected in 2004.\n11. **Pennsylvania 14**: Mike Doyle, first elected in 1994.\n12. **Pennsylvania 15**: Charlie Dent, first elected in 2004.\n\nNow we count those incumbents who were first elected before the year 2000:\n\n- Bob Brady: 1998\n- Mike Doyle: 1994\n\nThus, only 2 incumbents (Bob Brady and Mike Doyle) were first elected before 2000. \n\nThe claim states that there should be only 4 such incumbents.
