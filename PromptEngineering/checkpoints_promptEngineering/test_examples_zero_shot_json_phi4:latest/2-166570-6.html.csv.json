It should have been built before the year 2009.\n\nLet's examine these conditions using the provided table:\n\n### Step 1: Verify the Continent\n- We need to find the row where the structure is \"Omega Transmitter Chabrier\".\n- In the data, this structure appears in the second row.\n- The continent for this row is listed as \"Africa\".\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Year\n- Again, we refer to the second row where \"Omega Transmitter Chabrier\" is located.\n- The year of construction listed for this row is 1976.\n\nNow, let's evaluate these findings against the claim:\n\n- **Continent Check:** The structure \"Omega Transmitter Chabrier\" is indeed on the continent of Africa. This condition is satisfied.\n- **Year Check:** The structure was built in 1976, which is before 2009. This condition is also satisfied.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are met, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells to verify the claim are:\n- Row index 1 (second row), \"continent\" column: \"Africa\"\n- Row index 1 (second row), \"year\" column: 1976\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"continent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We'll look at the relevant column \"country.\"\n\n- For row index 2:\n  - The \"continent\" value is \"north america.\"\n  - The \"country\" value is \"united states,\" which, despite not matching exactly (\"united state\"), typically refers to the same entity.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim says, \"the country list for north america be the united state.\" While it refers to \"united state\" in singular form, the table lists \"united states,\" which is understood as referring to the same country.
