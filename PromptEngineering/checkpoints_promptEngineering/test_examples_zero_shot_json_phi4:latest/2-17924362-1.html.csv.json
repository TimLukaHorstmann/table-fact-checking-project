Since there's no direct contradiction regarding the year within the data, and assuming historical knowledge that Denver Broncos played in various stadiums during the 1970s, we proceed with the assumption that the dataset might pertain to a season around or including 1975.\n\n2. **Team**: The claim involves \"the Denver Bronco,\" which is consistent with how the Denver Broncos are referred to.

Scan the rest of the rows to ensure no other games mention OT.\n- All other games do not have \"(ot)\" in their results.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Only one game is marked as having gone into overtime: Row 11 (\"San Diego Chargers\").\n- Therefore, the claim that they went into overtime only two times is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nOnly one cell explicitly mentions an OT result.\n- Row Index: 10\n- Column Name: \"result\"\n\nHere's the JSON response reflecting this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to check several conditions:\n\n1. **Year**: The claim specifies \"in 1975,\" but the table does not contain a year column or context indicating the year of these games. Thus, this part cannot be verified from the given data.\n\n2. **Team**: The team mentioned in the claim is \"the Denver Broncos.\" In the table, all entries refer to \"mile high stadium,\" which is historically associated with the Denver Broncos. This suggests that the team playing at Mile High Stadium is indeed the Denver Broncos. \n\n3. **Finish the season with a win**: The last entry in the data corresponds to Week 14 (\"december 20\"), indicating the end of the season for this dataset.\n\n4. **Location**: According to the claim, the final game was played at \"the Miami Orange Bowl.\" We need to check if there is an entry where the Broncos (associated with Mile High Stadium) have a win at the Miami Orange Bowl.\n\n5. **Result**: The result should be a \"win\" for this claim to be true.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each relevant row in the table:\n\n- **Week 14**:\n  - Date: December 20\n  - Opponent: Miami Dolphins\n  - Result: L 13 - 14 (Loss)\n  - Game Site: Miami Orange Bowl\n\nThe Broncos did play at the Miami Orange Bowl, but they lost the game. Therefore, this does not satisfy the condition of finishing with a win.\n\nSince no other weeks involve the Denver Broncos playing at the Miami Orange Bowl and winning, we can conclude:\n\n- The claim that \"the Denver Broncos finish the season with a win at the Miami Orange Bowl\" is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Row 13 (Week 14) where it shows a loss at the Miami Orange Bowl.\n  \nThe JSON response reflecting this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We'll parse each entry to check if it represents a loss, then extract the number of points scored by Denver in that game.\n\nLet\u2019s go through the data:\n\n1. **Week 3:** Result is \"l 14 - 38\". Denver lost and scored 14 points.\n2. **Week 4:** Result is \"l 9 - 20\". Denver lost and scored 9 points.\n3. **Week 6:** Result is \"l 13 - 26\". Denver lost and scored 13 points.\n4. **Week 7:** Result is \"l 17 - 42\". Denver lost and scored 17 points.\n5. **Week 8:** Result is \"l 16 - 17\". Denver lost and scored 16 points.\n6. **Week 10:** Result is \"l 21 - 35\". Denver lost and scored 21 points.\n7. **Week 12:** Result is \"l 10 - 17\".
