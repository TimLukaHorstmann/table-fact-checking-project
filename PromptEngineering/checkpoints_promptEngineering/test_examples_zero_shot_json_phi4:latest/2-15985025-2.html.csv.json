    "resp": "To verify the claim \"David Bielkheden's highest record win in Stockholm, Sweden happened in the match against Diego Gonzalez,\" we need to check two conditions from the data provided:\n\n1. Identify all matches where David Bielkheden competed and won.\n2. Among these winning matches, identify those that took place in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nLet's evaluate each condition step-by-step using the table information:\n\n### Step 1: Determine All Winning Matches for David Bielkheden\n\nThe relevant column to look at is \"result,\" which shows whether a match was a win or loss. The rows with wins are as follows:\n- Row 0: Win against Diego Gonzalez\n- Row 3: Win against Steve Dawson\n- Row 4: Win against Josenildo Ramarho\n- Row 6: Win against Patrick Vallee\n- Row 7: Win against Tom Haddock\n- Row 8: Win against Valdas Pocevi\u010dius\n- Row 10: Win against Sigitas Antanavicius\n- Row 11: Win against Charles McCarthy\n- Row 12: Win against Kimmo Nurkse\n- Row 13: Win against Joni Kyllonen\n- Row 14: Win against Kai Rintakorpi\n\nThese are all the matches where Bielkheden achieved a win.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Wins in Stockholm, Sweden\n\nNext, we need to check which of these wins took place in \"Stockholm, Sweden.\" The relevant column here is \"location.\" We find:\n- Row 0: Location is \"stockholm, sweden\"\n- Row 6: Location is \"stockholm, sweden\"\n\nFrom the above evaluation, David Bielkheden won two matches in Stockholm, Sweden. These are against Diego Gonzalez and Patrick Vallee.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Highest Record Win\n\nNow, we need to assess which of these wins was his highest record win at that time:\n- For Row 0 (against Diego Gonzalez), let's check \"record\" before the match: \"6 - 1\"\n- For Row 6 (against Patrick Vallee), let's check \"record\" before the match: \"3 - 2\"\n\nSince a record of \"6 - 1\" indicates more wins than a record of \"3 - 2,\" the win against Diego Gonzalez was indeed Bielkheden's highest record at that point.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is supported by the data:\n- The match with Diego Gonzalez in Stockholm, Sweden, was David Bielkheden's highest record win up to that date.\n\nThus, the answer is \"TRUE.\" Below are the relevant cells used for verification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim, we must first analyze and verify each condition stated in it against the data provided.\n\n1. **Condition: David Bielkheden fought a total of 5 fights in Turku, Finland.**\n\n   - We need to identify all entries where:\n     - The \"location\" is Turku, Finland.\n     - The fighter involved is David Bielkheden.\n\n   After reviewing the data:\n   \n   - Row indices with location \"Turku, Finland\":\n     - 26: \"shooto sweden - initial collision\", Stockholm, Sweden (not relevant)\n     - 28: \"shooto finland - capital punishment\", Helsinki, Finland\n     - 29: \"ff 7 - finnfight 7\", Turku, Finland\n     - 30: \"shooto finland - capital punishment\", Helsinki, Finland\n     - 31: \"shooto finland - capital punishment 2\", Helsinki, Finland\n\n   Among these, only row indices 28 and 29 are in Turku, Finland:\n   \n   - Row 28 (X Win against Kimmo Nurkse)\n   - Row 29 (X Win against Joni Kyllonen)\n\n   Additionally, verify that David Bielkheden was the fighter involved. Since there is no explicit mention of names directly linked to rows, we assume this data pertains to his fights based on context.\n\n2. **Condition: 75% of these fights were wins.**\n\n   - Total number of relevant fights in Turku, Finland = 2 (rows 28 and 29).\n   - Wins out of these = 2.\n\n   Calculating the percentage:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Win Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Number of Wins}}{\\text{Total Fights in Turku, Finland}}\\right) \\times 100 = \\left(\\frac{2}{2}\\right) \\times 100 = 100\\%\n   \\]\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n\n   - The claim states \"5 fights\" but we identified only 2.\n   - While the percentage calculation (75%) is satisfied, it relies on having more fights than actually exist in Turku.\n\nTherefore, the claim that David Bielkheden fought a total of 5 fights in Turku, Finland, where 75% were wins, is incorrect based on the data provided. Only 2 fights occurred in Turku, and both were wins (100%).\n\nHence, the answer to the claim is \"FALSE\".\n\nThe relevant cells are those involved in verifying these conditions:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The fighter column lists \"Tommy Depret.\"\n2. The result column indicates a loss (\"x loss,\" \"y loss\") for David Bielkheden.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n- **Scan through the table** to find all entries with the outcome indicating a loss, specifically those labeled as \"x loss\" or similar, which denote fights involving David Bielkheden (since 'x' is the identifier used in this dataset for his matches).\n\n- **Check if Tommy Depret appears as an opponent in any of these losses.**\n\nLet's examine the relevant parts:\n\n1. **Row 19**:\n   - Opponent: \"shiko yamashita\"\n   - Result: \"x loss\" (indicating a loss for David Bielkheden)\n   - This does not match Tommy Depret.\n\n2. **Row 18**:\n   - Opponent: \"patrick vallee\"\n   - Result: \"x win\"\n   - This is a win, not relevant to the claim.\n\n3. **Row 17**:\n   - Opponent: \"steve dawson\"\n   - Result: \"x win\"\n   - Again, this is a win and not applicable here.\n\n4. **Row 16**:\n   - Opponent: \"josenildo ramarho\"\n   - Result: \"x win\"\n   - Another win for David Bielkheden.\n\n5. **Row 15**:\n   - Opponent: \"shiko yamashita\"\n   - Result: \"x loss\" (indicating a loss for David Bielkheden)\n   - No match with Tommy Depret.\n\n6. **Row 14**:\n   - Opponent: \"tommy depret\"\n   - Result: \"x loss\"\n   - This entry matches our criteria. It confirms that David Bielkheden lost to Tommy Depret.\n\nSince we have found an entry where David Bielkheden lost to Tommy Depret, the claim is supported by the data in row 14.\n\nThus, the relevant cell from the table for this verification is Row 14 under both the \"Opponent\" and \"Result\" columns.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
