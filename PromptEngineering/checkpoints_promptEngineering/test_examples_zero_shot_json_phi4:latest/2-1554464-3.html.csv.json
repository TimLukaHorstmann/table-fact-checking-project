The surface for these matches was carpet.\n\nLet's analyze the table data provided:\n\n- We are looking for rows where the opponent is \"mardy fish.\"\n- Check if there are any scores matching \"3 - 6, 4 - 6\" or \"1 - 6, 5 - 7\".\n- Verify if the surface for these matches was \"carpet.\"\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of relevant rows:\n\n1. **Row Index 8**:\n   - Opponent: \"mardy fish\"\n   - Score: \"7 - 5 , 3 - 6 , 4 - 6\" (This does not match the scores given in the claim)\n   - Surface: \"grass\"\n\n2. **No other rows** have Mardy Fish as the opponent.\n\nSince there are no matches where Mardy Fish beat Olivier Rochus with either score of \"3 - 6, 4 - 6\" or \"1 - 6, 5 - 7,\" we cannot verify the claim regarding the surface being carpet.
