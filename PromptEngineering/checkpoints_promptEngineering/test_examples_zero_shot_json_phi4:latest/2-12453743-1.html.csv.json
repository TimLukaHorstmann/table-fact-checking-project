    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. The INEGI code for Mexicali should be 2.\n2. The area of Mexicali should be 12,700 km\u00b2.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions using the data provided in the table:\n\n### Condition 1: INEGI Code\n- We look at the row where \"municipality\" is \"Mexicali\".\n- In the table, this corresponds to the second row (row index 1).\n- The \"inegi code\" for Mexicali in this row is 2.\n\nThis condition is satisfied.\n\n### Condition 2: Area\n- Again, we look at the row where \"municipality\" is \"Mexicali\".\n- In the table, the \"area (km\u00b2)\" for Mexicali is listed as 13,700.0.\n- The claim states that the area should be 12,700 km\u00b2.\n\nThis condition is not satisfied because 13,700 km\u00b2 does not equal 12,700 km\u00b2.\n\nSince one of the conditions in the claim is false, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells to verify the claim are:\n- The cell with \"municipality\" as \"Mexicali\" and \"inegi code\" as 2 (row index 1).\n- The cell with \"municipality\" as \"Mexicali\" and \"area (km\u00b2)\" as 13,700.0 (row index 1).\n\nHere is the JSON object representing the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"inegi code\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"area (km2)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
