    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"every team have several wins\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table, we need to assess if each team recorded in the data has more than one win in any series for a season.\n\nThe relevant column to verify this claim against is the \"wins\" column. Let's examine the data row by row:\n\n1. **Row 0:** \n   - Team: bvm minardi team\n   - Wins: 0\n\n2. **Row 1:** \n   - Team: bvm minardi team\n   - Wins: 0\n\n3. **Row 2:** \n   - Team: bvm minardi team\n   - Wins: 4\n\n4. **Row 3:** \n   - Team: bvm minardi team\n   - Wins: 0\n\n5. **Row 4:** \n   - Team: bvm minardi team\n   - Wins: 0\n\n6. **Row 5:** \n   - Team: manor motorsport\n   - Wins: 0\n\n7. **Row 6:** \n   - Team: manor motorsport\n   - Wins: 0\n\n8. **Row 7:** \n   - Team: bvm - target racing\n   - Wins: 3\n\n9. **Row 8:** \n   - Team: s fortec motorsport\n   - Wins: 0\n\nNow, let's evaluate the claim:\n\n- The \"bvm minardi team\" appears in rows 0 to 4 and has wins only in row 2 (with 4 wins).\n- The \"manor motorsport\" appears in rows 5 and 6 with no wins.\n- The \"bvm - target racing\" appears in row 7 with 3 wins.\n- The \"s fortec motorsport\" appears in row 8 with no wins.\n\nThe claim states that every team has several (more than one) wins. We see:\n\n- bvm minardi team: at least one instance of more than one win\n- manor motorsport: zero wins, not meeting the criteria of \"several\"\n- bvm - target racing: meets the criteria with 3 wins\n- s fortec motorsport: zero wins, does not meet the criteria\n\nSince both \"manor motorsport\" and \"s fortec motorsport\" do not have several wins (more than one win), the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this conclusion are those in the \"wins\" column:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
