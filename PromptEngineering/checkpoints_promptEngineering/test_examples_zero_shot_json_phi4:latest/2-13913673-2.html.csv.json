Each game has specific scores, losses, attendances, and records filled in without any note of being postponed.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- There is only one entry (April 23 against the Royals) that indicates a postponement.\n- The claim about there being just one postponed game and it occurring on April 23 against the Royals is accurate.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are those in Row 22 for all columns, as they contain information confirming the postponement of the game.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

This was the lowest scoring game in the dataset.\n\nLet's evaluate these step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Verify the Specific Game Score\n- Locate the row where \"date\" is \"april 27\" and \"opponent\" is \"yankees\".\n- Check if the \"score\" column for this row matches \"1 - 0\".\n\nFrom the data:\n- Row index 26 has \"date\": \"april 27\", \"opponent\": \"yankees\", and \"score\": \"1 - 0\".\n\n### Step 2: Verify it is the Lowest Scoring Game\n- Compare the total scores of all games in the dataset to ensure no other game had a lower combined score than 3 (since 1 + 0 = 3).\n\nLet's go through each relevant row:\n- Row index 0: \"score\": \"10 - 8\" \u2192 Total score = 18\n- Row index 1: \"score\": \"7 - 2\" \u2192 Total score = 9\n- Row index 2: \"score\": \"2 - 1\" \u2192 Total score = 3\n- Row index 3: \"score\": \"6 - 3\" \u2192 Total score = 9\n- Row index 4: \"score\": \"6 - 1\" \u2192 Total score = 7\n- Row index 5: \"score\": \"2 - 1\" \u2192 Total score = 3\n- Row index 6: \"score\": \"6 - 4\" \u2192 Total score = 10\n- Row index 7: \"score\": \"4 - 3\" \u2192 Total score = 7\n- Row index 8: \"score\": \"9 - 5\" \u2192 Total score = 14\n- Row index 9: \"score\": \"9 - 6\" \u2192 Total score = 15\n- Row index 10: \"score\": \"2 - 0\" \u2192 Total score = 2\n- Row index 11: \"score\": \"6 - 4\" \u2192 Total score = 10\n- Row index 12: \"score\": \"4 - 3\" \u2192 Total score = 7\n- Row index 13: \"score\": \"1 - 0\" \u2192 Total score = 1\n- Row index 14: \"score\": \"5 - 2\" \u2192 Total score = 7\n- Row index 15: \"score\": \"7 - 2\" \u2192 Total score = 9\n- Row index 16: \"score\": \"8 - 3\" \u2192 Total score = 11\n\nThe lowest total score is indeed 1, which occurs on April 27 against the Yankees.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied:\n- The game on April 27 against the Yankees had a score of 1 - 0.\n- It was the lowest scoring game in the dataset.\n\nThus, the claim is true.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about postponed games is true or false, we need to examine the table and specifically focus on entries where games were postponed.\n\n1. The claim states: \"out of the whole season, 3 games be postponed, 1 against the Mariners and 2 against the Royals.\"\n\n2. We will check each entry in the \"data\" array for indications of postponed games:\n   - The relevant column is either \"score\", \"loss\", or \"attendance\" since these columns reflect any postponements.\n\n3. Let's look at the entries:\n\n   - For April 23: \n     - Opponent: Royals\n     - All relevant columns (\"score\", \"loss\", \"attendance\") state \"postponed (rain) rescheduled for april 24\".\n     - This indicates one postponed game against the Royals.\n\n   - For April 24:\n     - Two games are recorded on this date against the Royals.\n     - The first entry's \"score\" is \"9 - 6\", indicating it was played, not postponed.\n     - The second entry's \"score\" is \"2 - 0\", also indicating it was played.\n\n   - No other entries in the table mention postponements.\n\n4. Conclusion:\n   - There is only one game recorded as postponed against the Royals on April 23.\n   - No games are listed as postponed against the Mariners or any other teams.\n\n5. Based on this examination, the claim that \"3 games be postponed\" and specifically \"1 against the Mariner and 2 against the Royal\" is not supported by the data in the table.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n\n- Row index 20 (April 23) for all columns (\"score\", \"loss\", \"attendance\") because it shows the postponement.\n  \nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Identify the row corresponding to the game against the Yankees.\n2. Check if the date is indeed April 29 for that game.\n3. Determine the attendance number for this specific game.\n4. Compare it with other attendance numbers across all games listed in the table.\n\nLet's proceed step by step:\n\n- **Locate Games Against the Yankees**: The rows where \"opponent\" is \"yankees\" are row indices 24, 25, 26, and 27.\n  \n- **Check Date for Each Game**:\n  - Row 24: April 25\n  - Row 25: April 26\n  - Row 26: April 27\n  - Row 27: April 28\n\nNone of these rows correspond to a game on April 29, which means there was no game against the Yankees on that date. Therefore, any claim about attendance for such a non-existent game is inherently false.\n\n- **Verify Attendance Figures**: The highest actual recorded attendance in the table is:\n  - Row 0: 41,872 (March 31 vs. White Sox)\n\nThe claim incorrectly refers to an attendance figure of 41,872 on April 29 against the Yankees, while this number actually corresponds to a game against the White Sox on March 31.\n\nGiven these findings, the relevant cells for verifying and refuting the claim are:\n\n1. Attendance of games against the Yankees (rows 24-27).\n2. Date check for each game against the Yankees.\n3.
