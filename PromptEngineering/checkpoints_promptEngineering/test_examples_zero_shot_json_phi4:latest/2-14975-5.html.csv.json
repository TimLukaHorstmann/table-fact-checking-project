    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's analyze it step by step using the relevant information from the table.\n\n### Claim Analysis\n\nThe claim states: \"more than 100 game be play for the series with the sawhorse dollar trophy.\"\n\nWe need to verify two main conditions based on this claim:\n1. Identify which team series has the \"sawhorse dollar\" trophy.\n2. Check if the number of games played in that series is more than 100.\n\n### Relevant Data from the Table\n\n1. **Identifying the Series with the Sawhorse Dollar Trophy:**\n   - The table provides the following column names related to trophies:\n     - `\"trophy\"`\n   - According to the data, the row corresponding to \"dartmouth - princeton\" lists \"sawhorse dollar\" as the trophy.\n\n2. **Checking Games Played for that Series:**\n   - We need to check the number of games played for the \"dartmouth - princeton\" series.\n   - The relevant column is `\"games played\"` which has a value of `\"90 games\"` for this row.\n\n### Verification\n\n- The series with the \"sawhorse dollar\" trophy is indeed \"dartmouth - princeton\".\n- The number of games played in this series is 90, which is not more than 100.\n\nSince the number of games (90) does not exceed 100, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- Row index 2, column \"trophy\" for identifying the trophy.\n- Row index 2, column \"games played\" for checking the number of games.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"trophy\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"games played\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
