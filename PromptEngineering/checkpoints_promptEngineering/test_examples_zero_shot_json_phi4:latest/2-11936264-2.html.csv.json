In this context, \"lowest rank\" implies that both teams have the same number of points and share the last position in the ranking.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant data:\n\n1. **Municipal Chorrillo:**\n   - Row index: 3\n   - Points (pts): 27\n\n2. **Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense:**\n   - Row index: 9\n   - Points (pts): 11\n\nThe table is ordered by rank, where the team with the highest points appears first. \n\n- Municipal Chorrillo has 27 points and is ranked 4th.\n- Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense has 11 points and is ranked 10th.\n\nSince these two teams have different numbers of points and occupy different positions in the ranking, they do not tie for the lowest rank. The team with the lowest rank in this table is indeed Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense, but there is no tie.\n\nThus, the claim is false. \n\nThe relevant cells to verify the claim are:\n\n- Municipal Chorrillo's points and row index.\n- Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense's points and row index.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points (pts)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points (pts)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if \"Arabe Unido\" has the highest number of points among all teams in the table, and whether this score is indeed 32.\n\nLet's break down the verification process:\n\n1. **Identify Points Column**: The relevant column for checking the number of points scored by each team is labeled \"points (pts)\".\n\n2. **Extract Data from Each Row**:\n   - We need to examine the \"points (pts)\" values across all teams in the table.\n   - Specifically, we should check that no other team has more than 32 points since \"Arabe Unido\" has 32 according to their row.\n\n3. **Verify Claim Against Table Data**:\n   - Team: San Francisco FC\n     - Points: 37 (row index 0)\n   - Team: Arabe Unido\n     - Points: 32 (row index 1, relevant for the claim check)\n   - Team: Tauro FC\n     - Points: 31 (row index 2)\n   - Team: Municipal Chorrillo\n     - Points: 27 (row index 3)\n   - Team: Atl\u00e9tico Chiriqu\u00ed\n     - Points: 26 (row index 4)\n   - Team: Alianza FC\n     - Points: 24 (row index 5)\n   - Team: Chepo FC\n     - Points: 23 (row index 6)\n   - Team: Sporting San Miguelito\n     - Points: 18 (row index 7)\n   - Team: Plaza Amador\n     - Points: 17 (row index 8)\n   - Team: Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense\n     - Points: 11 (row index 9)\n\n4. **Determine if the Claim is True**:\n   - From the data, we observe that \"San Francisco FC\" has more points (37) than \"Arabe Unido\".\n   - Therefore, Arabe Unido does not have the highest number of points in the table.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The claim is false because San Francisco FC has a higher point total (37) than Arabe Unido's 32 points.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells for Verification**:\n   - Row index 0, \"points (pts)\" to check if San Francisco FC has more points.\n   - Row index 1, \"points (pts)\" because it's directly related to the claim about Arabe Unido.\n\nThus, the final JSON output is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points (pts)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points (pts)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
