The \"location / attendance\" must match \"Wells Fargo Center (19684)\".\n2. The date of the game in December must be the 1st.\n\nLet's break down the relevant steps:\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the row corresponding to the game on December 1:\n  - Look at the \"december\" column to find a value of 1, which matches the specified date (December 1).\n\n- **Step 2**: Check if the location and attendance for this row match \"Wells Fargo Center (19684)\":\n  - Inspect the \"location / attendance\" column in the identified row.\n\nFrom the table data:\n- The game on December 1 is listed in the first row (`row_index` 0).\n- In this row, the \"december\" value is indeed 1.\n- The \"location / attendance\" for this row is \"Wells Fargo Center (19684)\".\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are met.

Whether game 32 indeed corresponds to a point total of 45.\n2. Whether this point total is the maximum compared to other games.\n\n**Step-by-step Verification:**\n\n1. **Identify Game 32's Points**:  \n   - Locate row corresponding to \"game\" value of 32 in the table. \n   - Find the column labeled \"points\".\n   - Check if the points for game 32 are indeed 45.\n\n2. **Verify Maximum Points**:\n   - Examine all rows in the \"points\" column.\n   - Determine the maximum value present among these entries.\n   - Confirm that this maximum is equal to or less than 45, thereby establishing whether game 32 holds the highest points.\n\n**Detailed Examination:**\n\n- For each row, observe the following relevant data:\n  - Row 26: Points = 34\n  - Row 27: Points = 36\n  - Row 28: Points = 38\n  - Row 29: Points = 39\n  - Row 30: Points = 41\n  - **Row 31**: Points = 43\n  - **Row 32**: Points = 45 (claim's focus)\n  - Row 33: Points = 47\n  - Row 34: Points = 49\n  - Row 35: Points = 49\n  - Row 36: Points = 49\n  - Row 37: Points = 51\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- From the examination, game 32 has a points value of 45.\n- However, there are other games with higher point values (47, 49, and 51), indicating that game 32 does not have the highest number of points in the dataset.\n\nTherefore, the claim is **FALSE**. \n\n**Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n\n- Game 32's points: Row 31, \"points\" column\n- Comparison rows' points:\n  - Row 32: Points = 45 (as per the claim)\n  - Rows with higher points than 45: \n    - Row 33: Points = 47\n    - Row 34: Points = 49\n    - Row 35: Points = 49\n    - Row 36: Points = 49\n    - Row 37: Points = 51\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 37, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
