This indicates a change since David 'Dave' Seville is no longer listed.\n\n3. **Determine Consistency**:\n   - The role of Alvin Seville appears consistently from 1987 to 2005, alongside Simon and Dave.\n   - From 2007 onwards, the listing only includes Alvin and Simon, suggesting a change in either actor or how roles are documented (e.g., no longer listing all three).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The absence of \"david 'dave' seville\" from 2007 suggests that there might be a different actor for Dave Seville or a change in the presentation.\n   - However, the claim specifically concerns Alvin Seville, and as long as \"alvin seville\" is consistently listed without mention of any other actors taking over his role, the consistency holds regarding the name.\n\n5. **Answer**:\n   - The actor playing Alvin Seville remains consistent across all entries from 1987 to 2011, even though there's a change in how roles are presented after 2006.\n   \nThus, the claim is supported by the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"role\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"role\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"role\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"role\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"role\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"role\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"role\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
