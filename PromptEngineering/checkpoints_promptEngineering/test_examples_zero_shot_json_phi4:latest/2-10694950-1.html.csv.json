Hence, we need to check if the numerical value of the distance exceeds 2000.\n\n4. **Convert Distance for Comparison**:\n   - Since distances are given in a format like \"1870.23 km\", extract the numeric part (i.e., 1870.23) and compare it with 2000.\n   \n5. **Determine Claim Validity**:\n   - If the distance is greater than 2000 km, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\n### Analysis for 1962:\n\n- In the table data, for the year \"1962\", we find:\n  - `[\"26 march - 8 april\", \"12\", \"1870.23 km\", \"edmundo de guzman ( phi )\"]`\n  \n- The distance is \"1870.23 km\", which numerically equals 1870.23.\n\n6. **Compare**:\n   - 1870.23 km < 2000 km\n\n7. **Conclusion**: \n   - Since 1870.23 km is not greater than 2000 km, the claim that the distance was over 2000 km in 1962 is FALSE.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"distance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe relevant cells are those at row index 8 with the columns \"year\" (to verify it's 1962) and \"distance\" (to check the value against the claim).",
