This player should have played for St Paul Saints (IHL), and his name should be Wayne Meredith.\n\nLet's go through the relevant steps:\n\n### Step 1: Check for a player from South Bend, Indiana\n- We need to examine the \"birthplace\" column to find players whose birthplace is \"South Bend, Indiana\".\n\nFrom the table:\n- **Wayne Meredith** has \"south bend , indiana\" as his birthplace. His row index is 13.\n\n### Step 2: Verify if this player played for St Paul Saints (IHL)\n- Next, we need to check if Wayne Meredith's entry in the column \"19631964 team\" matches \"St Paul Saints (IHL)\".\n  \nFrom the table:\n- For Wayne Meredith (row index 13), the \"19631964 team\" is listed as \"minneapolis , minnesota\". \n\n### Step 3: Verify the player\u2019s name\n- The claim also states that this player's name should be Wayne Meredith, which we have already identified in Step 1.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim requires there to be exactly one player from South Bend, Indiana who played for St Paul Saints (IHL) and is named Wayne Meredith.
