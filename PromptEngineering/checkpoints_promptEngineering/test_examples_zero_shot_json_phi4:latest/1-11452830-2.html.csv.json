According to the table, in row 4, the opponent is indeed listed as \"new orleans saints\".\n\n2. **Result**: The claim states that this was a losing game (\"l\"). In row 4 of the table, the result is marked as \"l 13 - 9\", confirming it was a loss.\n\n3. **Record before the game**: The claim specifies the record was \"1 - 3\" before this game. Before playing week 4 (row 4), the team's record from rows 1 to 3 is:\n   - Week 1: 0 - 1\n   - Week 2: 1 - 1\n   - Week 3: 1 - 2\n\n   After losing in week 3, their record became 1 - 2. Therefore, before the game against the Saints (week 4), the record was indeed \"1 - 2\". After losing to the Saints, it became \"1 - 3\".\n\n4. **Game Site**: The claim mentions that this game took place at the \"louisiana superdome\".
