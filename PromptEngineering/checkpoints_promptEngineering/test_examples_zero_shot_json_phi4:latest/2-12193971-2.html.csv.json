    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"elche cf have fewer than 40 goal against other team\" is true or false, we need to examine the table provided in JSON format and identify the relevant data for \"Elche CF.\"\n\n1. **Identify the Position of Elche CF**:  \n   - We look through the `data` list to find the entry where the club name matches \"elche cf\".\n   - In the given data, \"Elche CF\" is found at index 3 (row 4 when considering a typical 0-based index in programming).\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Column**:  \n   - We need the \"goals against\" column to verify the claim.\n   - According to the `columns` list, \"goals against\" is at index 8.\n\n3. **Check the Value**:  \n   - For \"Elche CF\" (at index 3 in the data), check the value under the \"goals against\" column (index 8).\n   - The value for \"goals against\" for Elche CF is `41`.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:  \n   - The claim states that \"Elche CF have fewer than 40 goals against other teams.\"\n   - Since the actual number of goals against is `41`, which is not less than `40`, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Compile Relevant Cells for Verification**:  \n   - We need to document the relevant cell used for verification, which involves the row index and column name.\n   - The relevant cell has a `row_index` of 3 (for \"Elche CF\") and a `column_name` of \"goals against\".\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false. Here's the JSON output reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goals against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim \"cd castell\u00f3n have 3 more loss than elche cf,\" we need to compare the number of losses for both teams as recorded in the table. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns and Rows:**\n   - We are interested in the column labeled \"losses\" since it records the number of losses each team has.\n   - For \"cd castell\u00f3n,\" look at row 5.\n   - For \"elche cf,\" look at row 4.\n\n2. **Extract Data for Comparison:**\n   - From the table:\n     - The entry for \"cd castell\u00f3n\" in the \"losses\" column is 12 (row 5, column \"losses\").\n     - The entry for \"elche cf\" in the \"losses\" column is 11 (row 4, column \"losses\").\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - According to the claim, \"cd castell\u00f3n have 3 more loss than elche cf.\"\n   - We calculate the difference in losses between the two teams:\n     - Difference = Losses of cd castell\u00f3n - Losses of elche cf\n     - Difference = 12 - 11 = 1\n\n4. **Determine Truth Value:**\n   - The claim states there should be a difference of 3, but we calculated a difference of only 1.\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - \"cd castell\u00f3n\" losses are found at row index 5, column name \"losses.\"\n   - \"elche cf\" losses are found at row index 4, column name \"losses.\"\n\nThe JSON object representing the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"losses\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
