These correspond to Bernie Kosar, Brian Sipe, Joe Montana, Otto Graham, Bill Nelsen, Norm Snead, Mike Phipps, Tim Couch, Bernie Kosar (again), Kelly Holcomb, Colt McCoy, Derek Anderson, and Brady Quinn.\n  - However, only those with more than 10 wins should be counted: Rows 0 through 12.\n\n- **Verification**:\n  - The claim states \"only 10 quarterbacks\" have more than 10 wins.

Identify Otto Graham's record:\n   - Look through the table to find \"otto graham\" in the name column.\n   - His row shows: wins = 2, ties = 2 (row index is 23).\n\n2. Identify Brady Quinn's record:\n   - Find \"brady quinn\" in the name column.\n   - His row shows: wins = 0, losses = 3 (row index is 18).\n\n3. Calculate the difference in wins:\n   - Otto Graham has won 2 games.\n   - Brady Quinn has won 0 games.\n   - Difference in wins = 2 (Graham) - 0 (Quinn) = 2.\n\nThe claim states that Otto Graham has won 44 more games than Brady Quinn. Our calculation shows a difference of only 2 games, not 44. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, we will list the relevant cells:\n\n- For Otto Graham:\n  - Wins column at row index 23.\n  \n- For Brady Quinn:\n  - Wins column at row index 18.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim that \"only 10 Cleveland Browns quarterbacks have won more than 30 games,\" we need to analyze the data provided in the table. Specifically, we focus on two columns: \"wins\" and \"losses.\" The row index will help us identify which quarterback's statistics are relevant for this evaluation.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**:  \n   - We only care about the number of wins each quarterback has achieved. Therefore, the relevant column is \"wins.\"\n\n2. **Count Quarterbacks with More Than 30 Wins**:  \n   - For each row (quarterback), we need to check if their win count exceeds 30.\n\n3. **Collect Data for Relevant Entries**:\n   - We go through each row and note down which quarterbacks have more than 30 wins along with the corresponding index in the data set.\n   \n4. **Verify the Count Against the Claim**:  \n   - After identifying all quarterbacks who meet the criterion (more than 30 wins), we verify if their count equals 10, as claimed.\n\n**Relevant Data Extraction:**\n\n- Row 0 (\"Brian Sipe\"): Wins = 112, Losses = 48 \u2192 More than 30 wins.\n- Row 1 (\"Mike Phipps\"): Wins = 21, Losses = 31 \u2192 Not more than 30 wins.\n- Row 2 (\"Bill Nelsen\"): Wins = 9, Losses = 25 \u2192 Not more than 30 wins.\n- Row 3 (\"Jim Bakken\"): Wins = 22, Losses = 38 \u2192 Not more than 30 wins.\n- Row 4 (\"Otto Graham\"): Wins = 104, Losses = 62 \u2192 More than 30 wins.\n- Row 5 (\"Norm Snead\"): Wins = 9, Losses = 15 \u2192 Not more than 30 wins.\n- Row 6 (\"Ken Anderson\"): Wins = 75, Losses = 47 \u2192 More than 30 wins.\n- Row 7 (\"Milt Plum\"): Wins = 16, Losses = 20 \u2192 Not more than 30 wins.\n- Row 8 (\"Bill Nelsen (second entry)\"): Wins = 4, Losses = 6 \u2192 Not more than 30 wins.\n- Row 9 (\"Don Strock\"): Wins = 21, Losses = 19 \u2192 Not more than 30 wins.\n- Row 10 (\"Sam Wyche\"): Wins = 24, Losses = 40 \u2192 Not more than 30 wins.\n- Row 11 (\"Bert Jones\"): Wins = 8, Losses = 15 \u2192 Not more than 30 wins.\n- Row 12 (\"Rick Mirer\"): Wins = 4, Losses = 13 \u2192 Not more than 30 wins.\n- Row 13 (\"Tim Couch\"): Wins = 19, Losses = 38 \u2192 Not more than 30 wins.\n- Row 14 (\"Brodie Croyle\"): Wins = 2, Losses = 10 \u2192 Not more than 30 wins.\n- Row 15 (\"Derek Anderson\"): Wins = 20, Losses = 25 \u2192 Not more than 30 wins.\n- Row 16 (\"Kelly Holcomb\"): Wins = 5, Losses = 12 \u2192 Not more than 30 wins.\n- Row 17 (\"Jeff Garcia\"): Wins = 6, Losses = 7 \u2192 Not more than 30 wins.\n- Row 18 (\"Brandon Weeden\"): Wins = 4, Losses = 13 \u2192 Not more than 30 wins.\n- Row 19 (\"Brian Hoyer (first entry)\"): Wins = 10, Losses = 2 \u2192 Not more than 30 wins.\n- Row 20 (\"Jake Delhomme\"): Wins = 6, Losses = 6 \u2192 Not more than 30 wins.\n- Row 21 (\"Seneca Wallace\"): Wins = 3, Losses = 8 \u2192 Not more than 30 wins.\n- Row 22 (\"Johnny Manziel\"): Wins = 2, Losses = 6 \u2192 Not more than 30 wins.\n- Row 23 (\"Baker Mayfield\"): Wins = 32, Losses = 14 \u2192 More than 30 wins.\n- Row 24 (\"Josh McCown (first entry)\"): Wins = 26, Losses = 19 \u2192 Not more than 30 wins.\n- Row 25 (\"Ty Detmer\"): Wins = 2, Losses = 2 \u2192 Not more than 30 wins.\n- Row 26 (\"DeShone Kizer\"): Wins = 1, Losses = 27 \u2192 Not more than 30 wins.\n- Row 27 (\"Case Keenum\"): Wins = 3, Losses = 6 \u2192 Not more than 30 wins.\n- Row 28 (\"Stefon Diggs (second entry)\"): Wins = 5, Losses = 11 \u2192 Not more than 30 wins.\n- Row 29 (\"Landry Jones\"): Wins = 2, Losses = 7 \u2192 Not more than 30 wins.\n- Row 30 (\"Drew Stanton\"): Wins = 3, Losses = 10 \u2192 Not more than 30 wins.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe quarterbacks with more than 30 wins are:\n- Row 0: Brian Sipe\n- Row 4: Otto Graham\n- Row 6: Ken Anderson\n- Row 23: Baker Mayfield\n\nIn total, only **four** quarterbacks have won more than 30 games. The claim states that there are ten such quarterbacks.\n\nTherefore, the statement is false.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": false,\n  \"relevant_rows\": [0, 4, 6, 23]\n}\n```",
