However, as long as there exists at least one instance where the engine was made before 1999, this condition is satisfied.\n\n### Condition 2: Power Check\n\n- We need to find rows with the `engine` value as \"m47d20\" and check their corresponding `power`.\n- From the data:\n  - Row 0: Engine is \"m47d20\", Power is \"100 kw (134hp) 4000\".\n  - Row 1: Engine is \"m47d20\", Power is \"85 kw (114hp) 4000\".\n\nThe second condition (power rating of \"100 kw (134hp) 4000\") holds true for row 0.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied in row 0, the claim is supported by this data entry. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- For verifying **Condition 1** and **Condition 2**, we need to look at the \"year\" and \"power\" columns in rows where the engine is \"m47d20\".\n- The relevant cells for row 0 are:\n  - `{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"}`\n  - `{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"power\"}`\n\nThus, we can conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"power\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

For this engine type and year combination, it must have a power of `90 kw (121hp) at 4000 rpm`.\n\nLet's go through the relevant parts of the data:\n\n- **Condition 1: Year check for `m47tu2d20`**\n  - Row 7 has an engine `m47tu2d20`, year `2004`.\n  - Row 8 has an engine `m47tu2d20`, year `2005`.\n  - Row 9 has an engine `m47tu2d20`, year `2004`.\n\nThus, the `m47tu2d20` engines were built in both 2004 and 2005.\n\n- **Condition 2: Power check for `m47tu2d20` in 2004**\n  - Row 7 has engine `m47tu2d20`, power `90 kw (121hp) at 4000 rpm`.\n  - Row 9 has engine `m47tu2d20`, power `120 kw (161hp) at 4000 rpm`.\n\nRow 7 matches the required condition for both the year and power specification.\n\nSince there is a row that satisfies both conditions in 2004, the claim is supported by the table.

We then need to identify the earliest year associated with this specific power specification.\n\nHere's how we can approach it:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: Look through each row to find entries where the \"power\" column matches \"90 kw (121hp) 4000\".\n\n2. **Extract Year Information**: For each of these rows, note down the year mentioned in the \"year\" column.\n\n3. **Determine Earliest Year**: Compare the years extracted from step 2 and identify the earliest one.\n\n4. **Compare with Claim**: The claim states that the earliest year should be 2003. We need to check if this is true based on our findings.\n\nLet's analyze the data:\n\n- Row 0: Power = \"100 kw (134hp) 4000\" - Not relevant.\n- Row 1: Power = \"85 kw (114hp) 4000\" - Not relevant.\n- Row 2: Power = \"100 kw (134hp) 4000\" - Not relevant.\n- Row 3: Power = \"85 kw (114hp) 4000\" - Not relevant.\n- Row 4: Power = \"85 kw (114hp) 4000\" - Not relevant.\n- Row 5: Power = \"110 kw (148hp) 4000\" - Not relevant.\n- **Row 6**: Power = \"90 kw (121hp) 4000\", Year = 2004\n- **Row 7**: Power = \"90 kw (121hp) 4000\", Year = 2005\n- **Row 8**: Power = \"120 kw (161hp) 4000\" - Not relevant.\n\nFrom the analysis, rows 6 and 7 have the power specification of \"90 kw (121hp) 4000\". The years associated with these rows are 2004 and 2005 respectively. Therefore, the earliest year is 2004.\n\nThe claim states that the earliest year should be 2003.
