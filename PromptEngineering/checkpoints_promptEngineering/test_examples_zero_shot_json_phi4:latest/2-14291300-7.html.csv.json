    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table data and check two main points:\n\n1. Identify games where the opponent was \"toronto maple leafs\".\n2. Verify if the \"points\" for these games match 63.\n\nLet's go through the steps of verification:\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Identify Opponent:**\n- We need to find rows in which the \"opponent\" column contains \"toronto maple leafs\".\n\nFrom the data:\n- Row 6: The opponent is \"toronto maple leafs\", and the points are 63.\n- Row 10: The opponent is \"toronto maple leafs\", and the points are 66.\n\n**Points Verification:**\n- In Row 6, the team scored 63 points in a game against the \"toronto maple leafs\".\n- In Row 10, the team scored 66 points in another game against the \"toronto maple leafs\".\n\nFrom this analysis:\n- The \"toronto maple leafs\" appear twice as an opponent.\n- Only one of these instances resulted in the team having 63 points (Row 6).\n\n**Check for Other Opponents:**\n- We need to ensure that no other opponents have exactly 63 points.\n\nFrom the data, we can see:\n- The only instance where \"points\" is equal to 63 occurs in Row 6 against the \"toronto maple leafs\".\n- No other rows show a points value of 63 for any other opponent.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that \"the toronto maple leaf be the only opponent with 63 point\". Our analysis confirms this because:\n- The only occurrence of 63 points is associated with games against the \"toronto maple leafs\".\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE. \n\nHere are the relevant cells for verification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
