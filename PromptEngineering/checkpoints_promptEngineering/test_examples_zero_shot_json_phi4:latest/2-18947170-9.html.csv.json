The elevation of Mount Kulal in Kenya.\n\nThe relevant column for checking this information is \"elevation (m)\" since it contains the data about each peak's height above sea level. We also need to ensure that the peaks are associated with the correct countries: Tanzania for Karenga and Kenya for Mount Kulal.\n\nLet's examine the table:\n\n- **Karenga**:\n  - According to the table, Karenga is listed under \"country\" as \"tanzania\".\n  - The elevation (m) for Karenga is given as 2279.\n  \n- **Mount Kulal**:\n  - According to the table, Mount Kulal is listed under \"country\" as \"kenya\".\n  - The elevation (m) for Mount Kulal is given as 2285.\n\nNow, let's verify these entries against the claim:\n\n1. Karenga in Tanzania has an elevation of 2279 m.\n   - The table confirms that Karenga is indeed in Tanzania and its elevation is 2279 m.\n\n2. Mount Kulal in Kenya has an elevation of 2285 m.\n   - The table confirms that Mount Kulal is indeed in Kenya and its elevation is 2285 m.\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are fully supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- For Karenga:\n  - Row index: 19\n  - Column names: \"country\" (to verify it is in Tanzania) and \"elevation (m)\" (to check its elevation).\n\n- For Mount Kulal:\n  - Row index: 18\n  - Column names: \"country\" (to verify it is in Kenya) and \"elevation (m)\" (to check its elevation).\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"elevation (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"elevation (m)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim about the table provided in JSON format, we need to evaluate two specific parts:\n\n1. The highest elevation claimed is 5895 meters with a peak in Tanzania.\n2. The lowest elevation claimed is 2848 meters located in Kenya.\n\nLet's verify these points using the data from the table:\n\n### Verification of Highest Elevation\n- We examine all entries under the \"elevation (m)\" column to find the highest value.\n- The highest value listed is 5895, corresponding to Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. This matches both parts of the claim regarding the peak and its location.\n\n**Relevant Cell for Highest Elevation:**\n- Row index: 0\n- Column name: \"elevation (m)\"\n- Column name: \"peak\"\n- Column name: \"country\"\n\n### Verification of Lowest Elevation\n- We examine all entries under the \"elevation (m)\" column to find the lowest value.\n- The lowest elevation listed is 2285 meters, which corresponds to Mount Kulal in Kenya. However, the claim states that the lowest should be 2848 meters, associated with Mount Ng'iro, also in Kenya.\n\n**Relevant Cells for Lowest Elevation:**\n- Row index: 19\n- Column name: \"elevation (m)\"\n- Corresponding value from the table is actually 2285, not 2848 as claimed.\n- Row index: 18\n- Column name: \"elevation (m)\"\n- This row corresponds to an elevation of 2848 meters for Mount Ng'iro in Kenya.\n\nSince the lowest actual elevation listed is different from what the claim states it should be, this part of the claim is false.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe verification shows that while the highest elevation and its corresponding peak location are correct according to the data, the lowest elevation stated in the claim does not match the table's information. Therefore, the claim as a whole is FALSE.\n\nHere is the final JSON response with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"elevation (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"peak\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"elevation (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"elevation (m)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The highest prominence for a peak in Uganda is 2458 meters, which satisfies the second condition of the claim.\n\nSince the first condition (\"more than 3 peaks\") is not met (only 3 peaks are listed), the entire claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nWe identify relevant cells that were checked to verify the claim:\n\n- For counting peaks in Uganda:\n  - Row 3: \"country\" and \"prominence\"\n  - Row 11: \"country\" and \"prominence\"\n  - Row 18: \"country\" and \"prominence\"\n\n- To confirm highest prominence:\n  - Row 3: \"prominence\"\n\nGiven these checks, the relevant cells are:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"prominence\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"prominence\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"prominence\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
