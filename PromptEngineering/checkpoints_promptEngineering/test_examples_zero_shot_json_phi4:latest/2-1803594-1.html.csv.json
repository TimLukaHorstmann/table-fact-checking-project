    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate the rankings for both the 1-year and 5-year columns in the table and identify if the lowest rank among these two columns is indeed 30.\n\nLet's examine each relevant column:\n\n- **\"1 - year ranking of 727\"**: This column contains the following values:  \n  - Centennial Collegiate Vocational Institute: 63\n  - Centre Dufferin District High School: 265\n  - Centre Wellington District High School: 330\n  - College Heights Secondary School: 717\n  - Erin District High School: 197\n  - Guelph Collegiate Vocational Institute: 16\n  - John F Ross Collegiate Vocational Institute: 181\n  - Norwell District Secondary School: 126\n  - Orangeville District Secondary School: 181\n  - Wellington Heights Secondary School: 371\n  - Westside Secondary School: 478\n\n- **\"5 - year ranking of 693\"**: This column contains the following values:\n  - Centennial Collegiate Vocational Institute: 22\n  - Centre Dufferin District High School: 281\n  - Centre Wellington District High School: 246\n  - College Heights Secondary School: 688\n  - Erin District High School: 148\n  - Guelph Collegiate Vocational Institute: 30\n  - John F Ross Collegiate Vocational Institute: 165\n  - Norwell District Secondary School: 343\n  - Orangeville District Secondary School: 194\n  - Wellington Heights Secondary School: 426\n  - Westside Secondary School: 343\n\nNow, let's identify the lowest rank from both columns:\n\n- The minimum value in the \"1 - year ranking of 727\" column is **16** (Guelph Collegiate Vocational Institute).\n- The minimum value in the \"5 - year ranking of 693\" column is **22** (Centennial Collegiate Vocational Institute).\n\nThe claim states that the lowest rank shown in either column should be 30. However, as we can see from our analysis:\n\n- The lowest rank across both columns is 16, not 30.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's list all relevant cells for verification:\n\n1.
