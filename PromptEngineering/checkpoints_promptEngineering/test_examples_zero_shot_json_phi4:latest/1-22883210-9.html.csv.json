    "resp": "To verify the claim that both the Golden State game and the Oklahoma City game were played at the AT&T Center with over 19,000 in attendance, we need to check specific columns for these games in the provided table data.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Games:**\n   - The game against \"Golden State\" is listed as row index 66.\n   - The game against \"Oklahoma City\" is listed as row index 68.\n\n2. **Check Location Attendance Conditions:**\n   - For both games, we need to check the \"location attendance\" column to ensure the location was AT&T Center and that attendance was over 19,000.\n\n3. **Verification for Golden State Game (Row Index 66):**\n   - \"Location Attendance\": \"at&t center 18581\"\n     - Location is \"AT&T Center\".\n     - Attendance is 18,581, which is over 19,000.\n   - Relevance: The location and attendance conditions are satisfied.\n\n4. **Verification for Oklahoma City Game (Row Index 68):**\n   - \"Location Attendance\": \"ford center 18203\"\n     - Location is not \"AT&T Center\"; it's Ford Center.\n     - Attendance condition does not matter since the location condition fails.\n   - Relevance: The location condition is not satisfied.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that both games were played at AT&T Center with over 19,000 in attendance.\n   - While the Golden State game satisfies both conditions, the Oklahoma City game does not satisfy the location condition (it was played at Ford Center).\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 66, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 68, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
