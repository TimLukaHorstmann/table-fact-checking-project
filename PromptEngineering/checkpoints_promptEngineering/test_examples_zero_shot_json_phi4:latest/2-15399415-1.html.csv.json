    "resp": "To verify the claim \"Olympic game held at Venice, Italy in 1984 have note 2:10:57,\" we need to check each part of the claim against the data provided in the table.\n\n1. **Event Type**: The claim mentions an Olympic game. We will look for entries with \"olympic games\" in the competition column.\n   \n2. **Year**: The year specified is 1984, so we need to find any entry corresponding to that year.\n\n3. **Venue**: According to the claim, the event was held in Venice, Italy. We'll check if there are any entries with \"venice, italy\" as the venue for an Olympic game in 1984.\n\n4. **Note/Time**: The claim states a note of \"2:10:57\". We need to verify if this matches the time mentioned in any relevant entry found.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions against the data:\n\n- Looking at the competition column, there is no entry for \"olympic games\" in 1984. The only Olympic event listed is from 1988.\n  \n- For the year 1984:\n  - There is an entry for \"new york city marathon,\" but it doesn't match the other conditions (competition type, venue, or note).\n\n- For \"venice, italy\":\n  - There's a record in 1988 for the \"venice marathon\" with a time of \"2:15:24\", not matching the claim.\n\n- The specific note \"2:10:57\" is found in the entry for the \"european championships\" held in Stuttgart, West Germany, in 1986. This does not correspond to an Olympic game nor matches any other conditions specified in the claim.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- There are no entries that match all parts of the claim: an Olympic game in Venice, Italy, in 1984 with a note \"2:10:57\".\n  \nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.
