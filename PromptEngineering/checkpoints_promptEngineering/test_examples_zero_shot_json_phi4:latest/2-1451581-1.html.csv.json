The rank of Shanghai Pudong International Airport.\n2. The total cargo load for Shanghai Pudong International Airport in metric tonnes.\n\nWe can find these details in the table by identifying the row where \"Shanghai Pudong International Airport\" is listed and then checking the relevant columns for this data.\n\n- **Rank Verification**: \n  - We need to check if the rank listed for \"Shanghai Pudong International Airport\" is indeed 3rd. According to the table, in the third entry (index 2), the rank column lists \"3\". Therefore, it confirms that Shanghai Pudong International Airport ranks 3rd.\n\n- **Total Cargo Verification**:\n  - We need to check if the total cargo load for this airport matches \"2939157 metric tonnes.\" In the same row as above, under the \"total cargo (metric tonnes)\" column, the value is indeed 2939157. This confirms that the claim about the cargo load is accurate.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data provided in the table, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table used to verify this claim are:\n- The cell at row index 2 and column \"rank\" (which shows \"3\").\n- The cell at row index 2 and column \"total cargo (metric tonnes)\" (which shows \"2939157\").\n\nHere's the resulting JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total cargo (metric tonnes)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The airport name is O'Hare International Airport.\n2. It holds the 17th rank based on total cargo handled.\n\nLet's break down the verification process:\n\n### Step 1: Verify the Rank\n- Look at the \"rank\" column to identify which row corresponds to rank 17.\n- According to the table, there is a row with rank 17:\n  - `row_index`: 16 (since indices are zero-based in programming contexts like JSON)\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Airport Name\n- Check if the airport at rank 17 is indeed \"O'Hare International Airport.\"\n- In the data:\n  - For `row_index` 16, the \"airport\" column specifies \"o'hare international airport.\"\n\n### Step 3: Verify Consistency with Cargo Data (Optional)\n- Although not explicitly required to verify the claim, we can check if other data aligns as expected:\n  - Confirm that the \"total cargo (metric tonnes)\" and \"% change\" values are present for consistency.\n  - For `row_index` 16, these values are 1512186 metric tonnes and \"3.0%,\" respectively.\n\nBy confirming both the rank and airport name match the claim's details, we establish the truth of the statement.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"airport\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object confirms that O'Hare International Airport does indeed rank 17th in total cargo as claimed.",
