    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"217 be the lowest 1st lbsc number with a lbsc name of granville\" is true or false, we need to carefully examine each relevant cell in the table.\n\nThe key elements of the claim involve:\n- Identifying entries with the `lbsc name` as \"granville\".\n- Comparing their `1st lbsc no`.\n\nSteps for verification:\n\n1. **Locate entries with `lbsc name` as \"granville\":**\n   - We need to check each row in the table where the column `lbsc name` is equal to \"granville\".\n\n2. **Extract and compare their `1st lbsc no`:**\n   - Once we have identified such rows, extract the `1st lbsc no` from these entries.\n   - Determine if any of these numbers are lower than 217.\n\nLet's go through the data:\n\n- For row with index 15:\n  - `lbsc name` is \"granville\".\n  - `1st lbsc no` is 216 (which is indeed lower than 217).\n\nSince we found an entry (\"granville\" with `1st lbsc no` of 216) that has a number lower than 217, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row index 15 for columns \"lbsc name\" and \"1st lbsc no\".\n- Row index 12 for column \"1st lbsc no\".\n\nHere's the JSON object with our conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"lbsc name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"1st lbsc no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"1st lbsc no\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
