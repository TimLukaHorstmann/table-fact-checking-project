Identify the row where the team is \"burnley\" and verify if the outgoing manager is \"brian laws\".\n2. Verify that in the same row, the position in the table at that time was \"9th\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - Search for the row where the team name is \"burnley\". This corresponds to `row_index` 12.\n\n2. **Verify Outgoing Manager:**\n   - Check the cell in column \"outgoing manager\" for `row_index` 12.\n   - The table states that the outgoing manager for \"burnley\" at this time is indeed \"brian laws\".\n\n3. **Verify Position in Table:**\n   - Check the cell in column \"position in table\" for `row_index` 12.\n   - The position listed is \"9th\", which matches the claim.\n\nSince both conditions (outgoing manager and position in table) match the details provided in the claim, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\n### JSON Response\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"position in table\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
