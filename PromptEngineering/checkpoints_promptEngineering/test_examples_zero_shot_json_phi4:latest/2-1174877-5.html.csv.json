    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the locomotive with number \"no 37413\", we need to verify two specific conditions from the table:\n\n1. The description should be \"br co - co class 37\".\n2. The livery should contain \"ew\".\n\nLet's examine each condition using the relevant data for \"no 37413\":\n\n- **Description Verification**:\n  - From the table, locate the row corresponding to \"no 37413\". This is found at `row_index` 10.\n  - Check the \"description\" column for this entry. It shows \"br co - co class 37\", which matches the claim.\n\n- **Livery Verification**:\n  - Again, using `row_index` 10 for \"no 37413\".\n  - Examine the \"livery\" column. The value is \"ews\".\n  - This contains \"ew\", satisfying the condition in the claim.\n\nBoth conditions are fully satisfied by the data provided in the table for \"no 37413\". Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"description\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"livery\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"the description of liveriy of scotrail be br bo - bo class 20\", we need to examine relevant information from the provided table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - The claim mentions \"scotrail\" and relates it to a specific locomotive type, \"br bo - bo class 20\".\n   - We must find the entries in the table that include \"scotrail\" in their livery description and check if any of them match \"br bo - bo class 20\".\n\n2. **Locate Scotrail Livery:**\n   - The table has a row where \"scotrail\" appears in the livery column, specifically for:\n     - Row index 10 (zero-based): `no 47643`, with description \"br co - co class 47\", and livery \"scotrail\".\n\n3. **Compare Locomotive Type:**\n   - The locomotive type in this row is \"br co - co class 47\".\n   - The claim states the type should be \"br bo - bo class 20\".\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The scotrail livery is associated with a different locomotive type (\"br co - co class 47\") than what is claimed (\"br bo - bo class 20\").\n   - Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - Row index 10 (scotrail livery entry): Relevant columns are \"description\" and \"livery\".\n\nThe final JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"description\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"livery\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
