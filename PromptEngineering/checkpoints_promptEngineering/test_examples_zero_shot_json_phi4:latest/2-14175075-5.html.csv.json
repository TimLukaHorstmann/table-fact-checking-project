    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"w gymnastics be the sport with the earliest date in 2007\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table:\n\n1. **Identify Sports and Dates**: We focus on the columns \"date\", \"sport\", and ensure that they pertain to the year 2007.\n\n2. **Filter by Year 2007**: Extract only the entries where the date is within the year 2007.\n\n3. **Locate \"w gymnastics\" Entry**:\n   - Check if there is an entry for \"w gymnastics\" in 2007 and note its date.\n   - The entry for \"w gymnastics\" is on February 22, 2008, which is not within the year 2007.\n\n4. **Find Earliest Date in 2007**:\n   - Compare all dates from the entries of 2007 to find the earliest one.\n   - The relevant entries are:\n     - September 4, 2007\n     - September 8, 2007\n     - September 9, 2007\n     - September 15, 2007\n     - November 10, 2007 (appears twice with different sports)\n     - December 5, 2007\n     - December 7, 2007\n     - December 8, 2007\n\n   - The earliest date is September 4, 2007.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since there is no \"w gymnastics\" entry in 2007 and the earliest sport event in 2007 occurred on September 4, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's list the relevant cells:\n\n- All entries from 2007 to determine the earliest date.\n- The specific row for \"w gymnastics\" to confirm it does not belong to 2007.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"sport\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
