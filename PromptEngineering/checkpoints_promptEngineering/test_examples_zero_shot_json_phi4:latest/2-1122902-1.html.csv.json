    "resp": "To evaluate the claim that \"there be 17 players who untimely retire during the 1984 European Grand Prix,\" we need to assess the table provided in JSON format and focus on identifying drivers who did not complete the full race distance (67 laps) and retired for any reason other than completing all laps.\n\nThe relevant columns from the table are:\n- \"laps\": to determine how many laps each driver completed.\n- \"time / retired\": to verify if a driver retired due to issues like \"ignition,\" \"overheating,\" \"gearbox,\" etc., indicating they did not finish.\n- The \"grid\" column will help us understand their starting position but is not directly relevant for determining retirement.\n\nTo determine the number of drivers who untimely retired:\n1. Count the drivers whose \"laps\" count is less than 67, as this indicates they did not complete the race.\n2. Ensure these drivers have a non-empty reason in the \"time / retired\" column (i.e., not just \"+ X time\" which denotes finishing the race).\n\nFrom the JSON data:\n- The total number of drivers listed is 23.\n- We need to count those with laps less than 67 and check their \"time / retired\" for any retirement reasons.\n\nHere's a breakdown of relevant entries:\n\n1. **Thierry Boutsen**: Laps = 64, Retired due to ignition\n2. **Derek Warwick**: Laps = 61, Retired due to overheating\n3. **Jo Gartner**: Laps = 60, Retired due to fuel system\n4. **Teo Fabi**: Laps = 57, Retired due to gearbox\n5. **Nigel Mansell**: Laps = 51, Retired due to engine\n6. **Patrick Tambay**: Laps = 47, Retired due to fuel system\n7. **Eddie Cheever**: Laps = 37, Retired due to fuel system\n8. **Philippe Alliot**: Laps = 37, Retired due to turbo\n9. **Jonathan Palmer**: Laps = 35, Retired due to turbo\n10. **Jacques Laffite**: Laps = 27, Retired due to engine\n11. **Elio de Angelis**: Laps = 25, Retired due to turbo\n12. **Stefan Johansson**: Laps = 17, Retired due to overheating\n13. **Keke Rosberg**: Laps = 0, Retired due to collision\n14. **Ayrton Senna**: Laps = 0, Retired due to collision\n15. **Marc Surer**: Laps = 0, Retired due to collision\n16. **Gerhard Berger**: Laps = 0, Retired due to collision\n17. **Piercarlo Ghinzani**: Laps = 0, Retired due to collision\n\nFrom the analysis above, there are exactly 17 drivers who retired for various reasons before completing all laps.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Nelson Piquet recording a faster full lap completion than Michele Alboreto is true or false, we need to analyze specific aspects of the data provided in the table:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim states that \"Nelson Piquet recorded a faster full lap completion than Michele Alboreto.\" This means we are looking for direct comparisons between their individual lap times.\n\n2. **Data Structure Review**: \n   - The relevant information from each driver's data would be in the \"time / retired\" column, as it shows their lap time or reason for retirement.\n   - Additionally, we need to consider how these times relate since they are shown with respect to the winner\u2019s (Alain Prost) time.\n\n3. **Extracting Relevant Data**:\n   - For Nelson Piquet: His time is \"+ 24.922\" over Alain Prost's winning lap time.\n   - For Michele Alboreto: His time is \"+ 23.911\" over Alain Prost's winning lap time.\n   \n4. **Interpreting the Time Data**:\n   - The times are given in relation to Prost\u2019s total race completion time, meaning these values indicate how much slower each driver was relative to Prost.\n   - A smaller positive number indicates a faster completion relative to Prost.\n\n5. **Comparison**:\n   - Nelson Piquet's \"+ 24.922\" is larger than Michele Alboreto's \"+ 23.911\", which means Piquet took more time than Alboreto to complete the race relative to Prost.\n   - Therefore, Piquet did not record a faster full lap completion compared to Alboreto.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the analysis, the claim is false because Nelson Piquet's recorded time was slower than Michele Alboreto\u2019s.\n\n7. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The cells relevant for this evaluation are those containing the \"time / retired\" information for both drivers: \n     - Row 2 for Michele Alboreto.\n     - Row 2 for Nelson Piquet.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
