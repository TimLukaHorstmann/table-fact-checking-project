According to the given JSON, this occurs at `row_index` 3.\n\n- **Step 2: Check Apps (Appearances) for Luca Toni**\n  - In `row_index` 3, under the \"apps\" column (index 6), we find the value is 258. This matches the claim's stated number of apps.\n\n- **Step 3: Check All-time Rank for Luca Toni**\n  - In `row_index` 3, under the \"all - time rank\" column (index 1), we find the value is 53. This matches the claim's stated all-time rank.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied by the data in the table, confirming that the statement about Luca Toni having 258 apps and an all-time rank of 53 is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n- \"apps\" at `row_index` 3\n- \"all - time rank\" at `row_index` 3\n\nNow we can construct the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"apps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"all - time rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
