Tobias Kamke didn't win any matches before playing in Canada.\n2. His first victory occurred when he played in Canada.\n\nTo evaluate these points, we need to look at the \"date\", \"tournament\" (specifically if it's in Canada), and \"outcome\" columns:\n\n1. Identify all rows where the outcome is \"winner\".\n2. Check if any of these winning matches took place before his first match in Canada.\n3. Verify that his first win was indeed during a tournament in Canada.\n\nLet's go through the data step-by-step:\n\n- **Row 0**: Outcome is \"runner-up\", irrelevant to the claim.\n- **Row 1**: Outcome is \"runner-up\", irrelevant to the claim.\n- **Row 2**: Outcome is \"runner-up\", irrelevant to the claim.\n- **Row 3**: Outcome is \"runner-up\", irrelevant to the claim.\n- **Row 4**: Outcome is \"winner\". The tournament location is Canada (\"Granby, Canada\"). This needs further verification against previous matches for timing.\n- **Row 5**: Outcome is \"winner\". This match was played in the US. Therefore, it invalidates the first part of the claim as Kamke had a win before playing in Canada.\n- **Row 6**: Outcome is \"winner\". This match also took place after Row 4's date and doesn't affect our analysis.\n- **Row 7**: Outcome is \"runner-up\", irrelevant to the claim.\n- **Row 8**: Outcome is \"winner\". The tournament location is Luxembourg. However, it occurred after Kamke's first Canadian victory.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Tobias Kamke won a match in Tiburon, US (\"row_index\": 5) before his first win in Canada.\n- Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells to consider are from row 4 (his first win in Canada), and row 5 (winning match prior to playing in Canada).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim that \"Kamke's first win be in Baton Rouge, LA, US,\" we need to examine relevant information about Kamke's wins in the provided table. Specifically, we should focus on finding the first instance where the outcome is \"winner\" and verify if this win occurred in Baton Rouge, USA.\n\n1. **Identify Rows with \"Winner\" Outcome:**\n   - We will look through each entry (row) to find instances where the outcome column states \"winner.\"\n\n2. **Determine Order of Wins:**\n   - Once we have identified rows where Kamke is a winner, we need to determine the chronological order based on the \"date\" column.\n\n3. **Verify Location of First Win:**\n   - For the first occurrence of a win (chronologically), check if the location specified in the \"tournament\" and \"opponent\" columns corresponds to Baton Rouge, LA, US.\n\n**Analysis of Table Data:**\n\n- Row 4:\n  - Outcome: Winner\n  - Date: 26 July 2010\n  - Tournament: Granby, Canada\n\n- Row 5:\n  - Outcome: Winner\n  - Date: 11 October 2010\n  - Tournament: Tiburon, US\n\n- Row 6:\n  - Outcome: Winner\n  - Date: 13 November 2011\n  - Tournament: Loughborough, UK\n\n- Row 8:\n  - Outcome: Winner\n  - Date: 16 September 2012\n  - Tournament: P\u00e9tange, Luxembourg\n\n**Chronological Order of Wins:**\n1. **26 July 2010:** Granby, Canada\n2. **11 October 2010:** Tiburon, US\n3. **13 November 2011:** Loughborough, UK\n4. **16 September 2012:** P\u00e9tange, Luxembourg\n\n**Verification of Claim:**\n\n- The first win chronologically is on 26 July 2010 in Granby, Canada.\n- The claim suggests the first win was in Baton Rouge, LA, US.\n\nTherefore, based on the table data, Kamke's first win was not in Baton Rouge, but rather in Granby, Canada. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\nTo verify this conclusion, we used these specific cells:\n\n- Row 4 (Granby Win):\n  - Column \"outcome\" and value \"winner\"\n  - Column \"date\" and value \"26 July 2010\"\n  - Column \"tournament\" and value \"Granby, Canada\"\n\n- Row 5 (Tiburon Win):\n  - Column \"outcome\" and value \"winner\"\n  - Column \"date\" and value \"11 October 2010\"\n  - Column \"tournament\" and value \"Tiburon, US\"\n\n- Row 6 (Loughborough Win):\n  - Column \"outcome\" and value \"winner\"\n  - Column \"date\" and value \"13 November 2011\"\n  - Column \"tournament\" and value \"Loughborough, UK\"\n\nThese cells helped determine the order of wins and verify that the first win was not in Baton Rouge.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
