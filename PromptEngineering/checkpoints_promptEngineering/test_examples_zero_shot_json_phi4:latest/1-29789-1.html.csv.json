    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to focus on the following parts of the table:\n\n1. Identify if there's a country in the \"Unwto region\" of Asia with 57.7 million international tourist arrivals for the year 2012.\n2. Check if the number of international tourist arrivals in 2012 (for that specific Asian country) is less than in 2011.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- We look at each row to find where \"unwto region\" is \"asia\".\n- The entry corresponding to China matches this criteria, with:\n  - International tourist arrivals for 2012: 57.7 million\n  - International tourist arrivals for 2011: 57.6 million\n\nNow, let's analyze the claim:\n- The claim states that in Asia, there were 57.7 million international tourists in 2012, and this number was less than in 2011.\n- From China's data:\n  - In 2012, tourist arrivals are indeed 57.7 million.\n  - However, in 2011, the tourist arrivals were 57.6 million.\n\nSince 57.7 million is greater than 57.6 million, the claim that \"57.7 million international tourist arrival (2012) which be less than in 2011\" is false for Asia.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n\n- The row index where China's data is found: `row_index = 2`\n- The column names are:\n  - \"unwto region\"\n  - \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\"\n  - \"international tourist arrivals (2011)\"\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE. Here's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"unwto region\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2011)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
