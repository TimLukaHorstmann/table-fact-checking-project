Confirm whether this aligns with the claimed record \"11 - 13 - 2\".\n\nLet's break it down step-by-step using the provided data:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Relevant Game\n- We need to find the row corresponding to the date \"January 18\" in the table.\n\n### Step 2: Check the Record Before and After January 18\n- Locate the game on \"January 18\". This is found at `row_index` 16.\n- The record before this game, listed on `row_index` 15 (the game on \"January 15\"), was \"16 - 13 - 3\".\n- The result of the game on \"January 18\" was a win for Chicago Black Hawks (\"5 - 3\" over Boston Bruins).\n- After winning this game, their record should be updated to \"17 - 13 - 3\".\n\n### Step 3: Compare with the Claimed Record\n- The claim states that after the January 18 game, the record should be \"11 - 13 - 2\".\n- Our verification shows the actual record was \"17 - 13 - 3\", not \"11 - 13 - 2\".\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim is incorrect based on the data provided.
