    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if an outfielder won the award every year from 1995 to 1999 according to the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Years:**\n   - We are interested in the years 1995 through 1999.\n\n2. **Extract Data for Each Year:**\n   - For each of these years, we will check the \"position\" column to see if it is labeled as \"outfielder.\"\n\n3. **Year-by-Year Check:**\n\n   - **1995:** \n     - Player: Ozzie Smith\n     - Position: Shortstop\n     - Conclusion: Not an outfielder.\n\n   - **1996:** \n     - Player: Kirby Puckett\n     - Position: Outfielder\n     - Conclusion: Is an outfielder.\n\n   - **1997:** \n     - Player: Eric Davis\n     - Position: Outfielder\n     - Conclusion: Is an outfielder.\n\n   - **1998:** \n     - Player: Sammy Sosa\n     - Position: Outfielder\n     - Conclusion: Is an outfielder.\n\n   - **1999:** \n     - Player: Tony Gwynn\n     - Position: Outfielder\n     - Conclusion: Is an outfielder.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim states that an outfielder won the award every year from 1995 to 1999.\n- In 1995, Ozzie Smith, a shortstop, won the award. Therefore, the condition is not met for this year.\n- For the years 1996 to 1999, an outfielder did win the award.\n\nSince the claim requires that an outfielder must have won every year from 1995 to 1999 and this was not the case in 1995, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells are those that contain the position information for each of these years. Here are the indices and column names:\n\n- **1995:** Row index 27, Column name \"position\"\n- **1996:** Row index 28, Column name \"position\"\n- **1997:** Row index 29, Column name \"position\"\n- **1998:** Row index 30, Column name \"position\"\n- **1999:** Row index 31, Column name \"position\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
