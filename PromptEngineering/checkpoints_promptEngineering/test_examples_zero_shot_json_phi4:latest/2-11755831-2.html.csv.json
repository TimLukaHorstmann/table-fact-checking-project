    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"kevin nickerson have 8 long and 73 yard\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table, we need to verify two parts of the claim:\n\n1. Kevin Nickerson's total yards.\n2. Kevin Nickerson's longest run.\n\nFrom the table structure given in JSON format:\n- The columns are [\"player\", \"car\", \"yards\", \"avg\", \"long\"].\n- Each row represents a player with their respective statistics: player name, number of carries (car), total yards gained (yards), average yards per carry (avg), and longest run (long).\n\nLet's break down the claim into its components:\n\n### 1. Verify Total Yards:\nThe claim states that Kevin Nickerson has \"73 yard.\" We need to find Kevin Nickerson in the table and check his \"yards\" value.\n\n- **Player**: Look for \"kevin nickerson\" in the player column.\n- The row containing Kevin Nickerson is found at `row_index = 1`.\n- In this row, under the \"yards\" column, the value is `73`.\n\n### 2. Verify Longest Run:\nThe claim states that Kevin Nickerson has a \"long of 8.\" We need to check his longest run in the table.\n\n- **Long**: Look for Kevin Nickerson's entry again at `row_index = 1`.\n- In this row, under the \"long\" column, the value is `9`.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe total yards part of the claim (73) matches what is in the table. However, the longest run part of the claim states \"8,\" while the table shows a value of \"9.\" Therefore, the claim about Kevin Nickerson having an 8-yard long run is incorrect.\n\nSince one condition of the claim does not match the data in the table, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- The cell with Kevin Nickerson's total yards: `row_index = 1`, `column_name = \"yards\"`.\n- The cell with Kevin Nickerson's longest run: `row_index = 1`, `column_name = \"long\"`.\n\nNow, let's compile the answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"yards\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"long\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"dane krager have 59 carry\" is true or false, we need to evaluate the data in the table related to Dane Krager.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - The claim specifies that Dane Krager has 59 carries.\n   - In the context of this table:\n     - \"player\" column corresponds to the name of the player.\n     - \"car\" (short for carries) column indicates the number of carries each player has.\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Data:**\n   - We need to find the row corresponding to \"dane krager\".\n   - In the given table, Dane Krager is listed in the first row (row index 0).\n\n3. **Check Carries for Dane Krager:**\n   - Look at the value in the \"car\" column for row index 0.\n   - The value is 59.\n\n4. **Verification of Claim:**\n   - Since the table shows that Dane Krager has 59 carries, this matches the claim exactly.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - All conditions in the claim are satisfied by the data provided in the table for the relevant cell (row index 0, column \"car\").\n   - Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cell to verify this claim is:\n     - Row Index: 0\n     - Column Name: \"car\"\n\nThus, based on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"car\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
