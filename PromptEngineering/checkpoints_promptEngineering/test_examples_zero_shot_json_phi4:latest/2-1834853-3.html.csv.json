The year is not 2002. Irrelevant.\n- **Row 1**: Date is \"7 June 2000\". The year is not 2002. Irrelevant.\n- **Row 2**: Date is \"7 June 2000\". The year is not 2002.

Irrelevant.\n- **Row 5**: Date is \"1 September 2001\". The year is not 2002. Irrelevant.\n- **Row 6**: Date is \"9 May 2002\". This match occurred in 2002, so it's relevant. Scored: \"7 - 0\", Result: \"7 - 0\". No individual player scoring data is given in the table; hence we cannot attribute any goals to Carsten Jancker.\n- **Row 7**: Date is \"1 June 2002\". This match occurred in 2002, so it's relevant. Scored: \"4 - 0\", Result: \"8 - 0\". Again, no individual player scoring data is available; hence we cannot attribute any goals to Carsten Jancker.\n- **Row 8**: Date is \"21 August 2002\". This match occurred in 2002, so it's relevant. Scored: \"2 - 2\", Result: \"2 - 2\". No individual player scoring data is available; hence we cannot attribute any goals to Carsten Jancker.\n- **Row 9**: Date is \"11 October 2002\". This match occurred in 2002, so it's relevant. Scored: \"1 - 1\", Result: \"1 - 1\". No individual player scoring data is available; hence we cannot attribute any goals to Carsten Jancker.\n\nThe table does not provide information about which specific players scored the goals in each match.

We assume Carsten Jancker's goals are part of these totals for Germany.\n\n3. **Verify Goal Totals:**\n   - For each relevant match at Dreisamstadion, Freiburg, count the total goals Germany is presumed to have scored (as indicated by the score associated with the result).\n   - Sum up these goal counts across all matches at this venue.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Match 1:**\n   - Date: \"7 June 2000\"\n   - Venue: \"dreisamstadion , freiburg\"\n   - Score: \"6 - 2\", Result: \"8 - 2\" (Germany's score is likely the second value in result, 8)\n   \n2. **Match 2:**\n   - Date: \"7 June 2000\"\n   - Venue: \"dreisamstadion , freiburg\"\n   - Score: \"8 - 2\", Result: \"8 - 2\" (Germany's score is 8)\n\n3. **Match 3:**\n   - Date: \"9 May 2002\"\n   - Venue: \"dreisamstadion , freiburg\"\n   - Score: \"7 - 0\", Result: \"7 - 0\" (Germany's score is 7)\n\n### Total Goals Calculation:\n- From the matches, Germany scored a total of \\(8 + 8 + 7 = 23\\) goals at Dreisamstadion, Freiburg.\n- Since there are no specific details on individual scorers or how these goals were distributed among players, we cannot definitively attribute exactly 3 goals to Carsten Jancker without additional information.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased solely on the data provided in the table, while Germany scored a significant number of goals at Dreisamstadion, Freiburg, there is no specific evidence attributing 3 of those goals directly to Carsten Jancker.

In most football competitions, a win earns 3 points, a draw earns 1 point, and a loss earns 0 points. Therefore, if Carsten Jancker's team scored 2 points, it implies they drew two separate games.\n\nNow, let's examine the table:\n\n1. **Game on \"3 June 2000\"**: Score = \"1 - 0\", Result = \"3 - 2\". (Not a draw)\n2. **Games on \"7 June 2000\"**: Scores = \"6 - 2\" and \"8 - 2\", Results = \"8 - 2\". (Not draws)\n3. **Game on \"2 June 2001\"**: Score = \"2 - 2\", Result = \"2 - 2\".

(This is another draw, so they earn another point)\n9. **Game on \"11 October 2002\"**: Score = \"1 - 1\", Result = \"1 - 1\". (Another draw, but we only need two separate draws for 2 points)\n\nFrom this analysis:\n- Carsten Jancker's team drew games on \"2 June 2001\" and \"21 August 2002\".\n- Both of these are separate matches where the score ended in a draw.\n\nThus, they earned exactly 2 points from two separate drawn games.
