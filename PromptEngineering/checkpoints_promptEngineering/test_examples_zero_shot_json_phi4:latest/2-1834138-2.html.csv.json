    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the given table and match it against the conditions specified in the claim: \n\n**Claim:** \"the population when the area be 4575 be 176239\"\n\nHere's how we'll verify this:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:** The relevant columns for this claim are \"area\" and \"population\". We need to find a row where the \"area\" is 4575.\n\n2. **Find Matching Row:**\n   - Go through each row in the data section of the table.\n   - Check if there's any row with an \"area\" value of 4575.\n\n3. **Verify Population for the Matching Row:**\n   - Once we find a row where the \"area\" is 4575, check the corresponding \"population\" value to see if it matches 176239 as stated in the claim.\n\n**Step-by-Step Verification:**\n\n1. **Row Analysis:**\n\n   - Row 0 (Headers): Not relevant for data comparison.\n   \n   - Row 1: \n     - Area = 9\n     - Population = 110916\n\n   - Row 2:\n     - Area = 11\n     - Population = 140070\n\n   - Row 3:\n     - Area = 30\n     - Population = 119047\n\n   - Row 4:\n     - Area = 27\n     - Population = 74396\n\n   - **Row 5:**\n     - Area = 4575 (Matches the condition)\n     - Population = 175239\n\n   - Row 6:\n     - Area = 6761\n     - Population = 220131\n\n   - Row 7:\n     - Area = 3344\n     - Population = 174063\n\n2. **Verification:**\n   - In Row 5, the \"area\" is indeed 4575.\n   - The corresponding \"population\" in this row is 175239, not 176239 as claimed.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the population for an area of 4575 is 175239 and not 176239, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n\n- Row 5:\n  - Column \"area\": Value = 4575\n  - Column \"population\": Value = 175239\n\nThe JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"area\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"population\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
