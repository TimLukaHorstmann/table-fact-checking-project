    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two main parts:\n\n1. **Trend in Height and Floors**: Determine if taller buildings generally have more floors, with an exception.\n2. **Specific Case for Union Bank of California Tower**:\n   - Check if it became the tallest in 1972 at 268 feet.\n   - Verify if it had 10 fewer floors than the previously tallest building.\n\nLet's analyze each part using the table:\n\n### Part 1: Trend in Height and Floors\n- **Wells Fargo Building**: 185 ft, 12 floors\n- **Yeon Building**: 194 ft, 15 floors (Increase in both)\n- **American Bank Building**: 207 ft, 15 floors (Increase in height, same floors)\n- **Public Service Building**: 220 ft, 16 floors (Increase in both)\n- **Hilton Portland Hotel**: 241 ft, 22 floors (Increase in both)\n- **Harrison West Condominium Tower**: 256 ft, 25 floors (Increase in both)\n- **Union Bank of California Tower**: 268 ft, 15 floors (Increase in height, fewer floors)\n- **Standard Insurance Center**: 367 ft, 27 floors (Increase in both)\n- **Wells Fargo Center**: 546 ft, 41 floors (Increase in both)\n\nThe Union Bank of California Tower is the exception where the height increased but the number of floors decreased.\n\n### Part 2: Specific Case for Union Bank of California Tower\n- **Height Check**: The Union Bank of California Tower is 268 feet tall and was tallest from 1969 to 1970.\n- **Comparison with Previous Tallest (Harrison West Condominium Tower)**:\n  - Harrison West was 256 ft, 25 floors.\n  - Union Bank is 268 ft, 15 floors.\n  - Difference in floors: 25 - 15 = 10 floors.\n\nThe claim states it became tallest in 1972, but according to the table, it was tallest until 1970. This discrepancy makes part of the claim false.\n\n### Conclusion\n- The trend analysis supports the claim except for the Union Bank Tower.\n- The specific assertion about becoming tallest in 1972 is incorrect; it was tallest until 1970.\n\nThus, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nTo verify the claim, we need to check:\n- Heights and floors of each building for trend analysis.\n- Specific details for Union Bank of California Tower and Harrison West Condominium Tower.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"height feet / m\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"height feet / m\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"height feet / m\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"height feet / m\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"height feet / m\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"height feet / m\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"height feet / m\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"height feet / m\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"height feet / m\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"floors\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
