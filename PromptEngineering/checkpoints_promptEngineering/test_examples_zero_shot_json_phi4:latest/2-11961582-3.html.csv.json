    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the November 16 score is true or false, we need to verify specific details from the provided table:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Entry**: The claim refers to a game on \"November 16.\" We must find this date in the data rows of the table.\n\n2. **Locate the Row for November 16**:\n   - By examining the \"date\" column, we identify that row index `8` corresponds to \"november 16.\"\n\n3. **Verify the Claimed Score**:\n   - Check the \"score\" column in this row (row index 8) to confirm if it matches the score mentioned in the claim.\n   - The entry for November 16 is: `\"l 123 - 126\"`.\n\n4. **Analyze the Claim**:\n   - The claim states, \"the november 16 score be i 123 - 126.\"\n   - Correcting any typographical errors or assumptions in the claim, we interpret it as asserting that the score was indeed `123 - 126`.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the actual entry matches the claimed score (after interpreting the statement correctly), the claim is true.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells for verifying this claim are from row index 8 in both the \"date\" and \"score\" columns.\n\nThus, the JSON object reflecting our findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
