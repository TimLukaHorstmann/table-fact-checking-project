    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"The cardinal - priest of S Anastasia be the cardinal order and title that be elevate earlier than 1116,\" we need to verify two key points from the provided table:\n\n1. Identify which entry corresponds to the \"cardinal - priest of S Anastasia.\"\n2. Check if this entry was elevated before 1116.\n\nLet's go through each step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Relevant Entry\n\nThe relevant column for identifying cardinal order and title is `\"cardinalatial order and title\"`. We look for the entry that matches \"cardinal - priest of S Anastasia.\" According to the table, this corresponds to row index 4.\n\n### Step 2: Check Elevation Date\n\nNow, we need to check if the elevation date (\"elevated\") for this entry is before 1116. The relevant data for this entry (row index 4) in the `\"elevated\"` column reads \"circa 1116.\"\n\n- **Interpretation of \"circa\"**: The term \"circa\" implies approximately or around that year. This means the actual elevation could be slightly before or after 1116, but for clarity and standard interpretation, it is considered to be exactly 1116 unless specified otherwise.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the elevation date for Bosone, the cardinal - priest of S Anastasia, is \"circa 1116,\" this does not qualify as being earlier than 1116. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells that verify this conclusion are:\n- Row index 4, `\"cardinalatial order and title\"`: \"cardinal - priest of S Anastasia\"\n- Row index 4, `\"elevated\"`: \"circa 1116\"\n\nHere's the JSON object representing the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"cardinalatial order and title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"elevated\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
