    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"the los angeles lakers play only 1 time against the new orleans during their 2010 - 11 season,\" we need to analyze the data provided in the table.\n\n### Relevant Analysis:\n\n1. **Team Column**: We need to look at each row's \"team\" value to see if it indicates that a game was played against New Orleans.\n2. **Count of Games Against New Orleans**: Count how many times \"New Orleans\" appears in the \"team\" column, as this will indicate how many games were played against them.\n\n### Examination:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Team: \"new orleans\"\n  - This indicates a game was played against New Orleans.\n  \n- **Row 1**:\n  - Team: \"new orleans\"\n  - Another game played against New Orleans.\n  \n- **Row 2**:\n  - Team: \"new orleans\"\n  - Another game played against New Orleans.\n\n- **Row 3**: \n  - Team: \"new orleans\"\n  - Another game played against New Orleans.\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Team: \"new orleans\"\n  - Another game played against New Orleans.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe table shows that there were five games listed where the Los Angeles Lakers played against New Orleans. Therefore, the claim stating they played only one time is incorrect.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is **FALSE**.\n\nHere are the relevant cells from the table to verify this conclusion (all rows in the \"team\" column are relevant):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
