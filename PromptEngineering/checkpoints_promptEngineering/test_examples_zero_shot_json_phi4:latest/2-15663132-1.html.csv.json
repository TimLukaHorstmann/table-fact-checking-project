    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"no 2 song have the same amount of week on top\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table, we need to examine the \"weeks on top\" data for each entry in the table.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The relevant column for this claim is \"weeks on top,\" which indicates how many weeks a particular song stayed at the top of the charts.\n\n2. **Extract Data**: Extract and list the values under the \"weeks on top\" column from each row in the data section.\n\n3. **Check for Duplicates**: Compare these extracted values to check if any two songs have spent the same number of weeks at the top.\n\n### Data Extraction:\n\nLet's extract the \"weeks on top\" values from each row:\n\n- Row 0: 6 weeks\n- Row 1: 1 week\n- Row 2: 1 week\n- Row 3: 4 weeks\n- Row 4: 1 week\n- Row 5: 1 week\n- Row 6: 5 weeks\n- Row 7: 2 weeks\n- Row 8: 1 week\n- Row 9: 3 weeks\n- Row 10: 3 weeks\n- Row 11: 1 week\n- Row 12: 4 weeks\n- Row 13: 2 weeks\n- Row 14: 4 weeks\n- Row 15: 1 week\n- Row 16: (missing information)\n- Row 17: 1 week\n- Row 18: 2 weeks\n- Row 19: 4 weeks\n- Row 20: 2 weeks\n- Row 21: 3 weeks\n- Row 22: 2 weeks\n\n### Check for Duplicates:\n\nNow, we will check if any value appears more than once (excluding the row with missing information):\n\n- **1 week**: Appears in rows 1, 2, 4, 5, 11, and 15.\n- **2 weeks**: Appears in rows 7, 13, 18, 20, and 22.\n- **3 weeks**: Appears in rows 9, 10, and 21.\n- **4 weeks**: Appears in rows 3, 12, 14, and 19.\n- **5 weeks**: Appears only in row 6.\n\nThe values \"1 week,\" \"2 weeks,\" \"3 weeks,\" and \"4 weeks\" appear multiple times. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there are several instances where different songs have spent the same number of weeks at the top.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nBased on our analysis, we need to identify all rows with duplicate \"weeks on top\" values:\n\n- **1 week**: Rows 1, 2, 4, 5, 11, and 15.\n- **2 weeks**: Rows 7, 13, 18, 20, and 22.\n- **3 weeks**: Rows 9, 10, and 21.\n- **4 weeks**: Rows 3, 12, 14, and 19.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
