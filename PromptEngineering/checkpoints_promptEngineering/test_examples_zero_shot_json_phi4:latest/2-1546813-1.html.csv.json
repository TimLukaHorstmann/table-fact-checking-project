The highest score for a winning team should be 18.\n2. The lowest score for a winning team should be 13.\n\nLet's examine each row in the data where a team has won and check their respective scores under the \"score\" column:\n\n- **2013**: Europe won with a score of 18 - 10. Here, the highest score by the winning team is 18.\n  \n- **2011**: Europe won with a score of 15 - 13. The winning score here is 15.\n\n- **2009**: United States won with a score of 16 - 12.

The winning score here is 15\u00bd, which can be interpreted as 15.5 in decimal form.\n\n- **2003**: Europe won with a score of 17\u00bd - 10\u00bd. The winning score here is 17\u00bd, or 17.5 in decimal form.\n\n- **2002**: United States won with a score of 15\u00bd - 12\u00bd. The winning score here is 15\u00bd (or 15.5).\n\n- **2000**: Europe won with a score of 14\u00bd - 11\u00bd. The winning score here is 14\u00bd, or 14.5 in decimal form.\n\n- **1998**: United States won with a score of 16 - 12. The winning score here is 16.\n\n- **1996**: United States won with a score of 17 - 11. The winning score here is 17.\n\n- **1994**: United States won with a score of 13 - 7. The winning score here is 13.\n\n- **1992**: Europe won with a score of 11\u00bd - 6\u00bd. The winning score here is 11\u00bd, or 11.5 in decimal form.\n\n- **1990**: United States won with a score of 11\u00bd - 4\u00bd. The winning score here is 11\u00bd, or 11.5 in decimal form.\n\nFrom the above data:\n\n- The highest score for a winning team observed is indeed 18 (from the year 2013 when Europe won).\n- The lowest score for a winning team observed is 11\u00bd (or 11.5) which occurs twice: once in 1992 and again in 1990, both times Europe was the winner.\n\nThe claim states that the lowest score should be 13, but we found instances where it's lower than 13 (11\u00bd).\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.
