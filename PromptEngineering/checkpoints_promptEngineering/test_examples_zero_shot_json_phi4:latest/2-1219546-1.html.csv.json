    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim about the shortest game in the 1977 World Series occurring on October 13th, we need to evaluate the relevant data from the table.\n\nThe claim focuses on two main aspects:\n1. The date: \"October 13th\"\n2. Game duration being the shortest\n\nFrom the provided JSON:\n\n- **Column Relevance**:\n  - We need to check both the \"date\" and \"time\" columns, as they contain information about when the games took place and their durations.\n\n- **Data Analysis**:\n  - The table includes data for six games with dates ranging from October 11th to October 18th.\n  - Notably, there is no game listed on \"October 13th\", which already suggests a problem in fulfilling part of the claim.\n  \n- **Game Duration Comparison**:\n  - To evaluate which game was the shortest by duration, we compare the times provided for each game:\n    - October 11: 3:24\n    - October 12: 2:27\n    - October 14: 2:31\n    - October 15: 2:07 (shortest time listed)\n    - October 16: 2:29\n    - October 18: 2:18\n\nThe shortest game occurred on \"October 15th\" with a duration of \"2:07\", not \"October 13th\". Furthermore, there is no record for any game on \"October 13th\".\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The claim that the shortest game was played on October 13th is **FALSE**.\n\nRelevant cells from the table to verify the claim are:\n\n1.
