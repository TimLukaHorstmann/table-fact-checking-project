We will look specifically at occurrences where the opponent is listed as \"padres.\" Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: The only column that contains information about opponents is the \"opponent\" column.\n\n2. **Scan the Data for Opponents**:\n   - Look through each entry in the \"data\" list to find all instances where \"padres\" appears in the \"opponent\" column.\n   \n3. **Count Occurrences**:\n   - Count how many times \"padres\" is listed as an opponent.\n\n4. **Compare with Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the Padres were the opponents four times during the season.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if every game in the given table was attended by more than 30,000 people.\n\nThe relevant column for this task is \"attendance\". We will check each entry under this column to see if it meets the condition of being greater than 30,000. Let's analyze the data row by row:\n\n1. September 1: Attendance = 24,785 (less than 30,000)\n2. September 2: Attendance = 18,231 (less than 30,000)\n3. September 3: Attendance = 32,022 (more than 30,000)\n4. September 4: Attendance = 20,042 (less than 30,000)\n5. September 5: Attendance = 16,144 (less than 30,000)\n6. September 6: Attendance = 13,351 (less than 30,000)\n7. September 7: Attendance = 15,886 (less than 30,000)\n8. September 9: Attendance = 18,130 (less than 30,000)\n9. September 10: Attendance = 24,437 (less than 30,000)\n10. September 11: Attendance = 17,392 (less than 30,000)\n11. September 13: Attendance = 23,708 (less than 30,000)\n12. September 14: Attendance = 23,793 (less than 30,000)\n13. September 15: Attendance = 20,741 (less than 30,000)\n14. September 16: Attendance = 33,767 (more than 30,000)\n15. September 17: Attendance = 37,756 (more than 30,000)\n16. September 18: Attendance = 35,052 (more than 30,000)\n17. September 20: Attendance = 30,136 (more than 30,000)\n18. September 21: Attendance = 30,049 (more than 30,000)\n19. September 22: Attendance = 31,137 (more than 30,000)\n20. September 23: Attendance = 22,472 (less than 30,000)\n21. September 24: Attendance = 33,506 (more than 30,000)\n22. September 25: Attendance = 20,150 (less than 30,000)\n23. September 26: Attendance = 14,412 (less than 30,000)\n24. September 27: Attendance = 28,031 (less than 30,000)\n25. September 28: Attendance = 21,181 (less than 30,000)\n26. September 29: Attendance = 13,173 (less than 30,000)\n27. September 30: Attendance = 20,922 (less than 30,000)\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that there are several games with attendance figures less than 30,000.
