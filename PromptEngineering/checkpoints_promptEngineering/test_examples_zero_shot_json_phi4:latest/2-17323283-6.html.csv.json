    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"the philadelphia flyer record be 40 - 11 - 10 as of february 23rd,\" we need to verify two main components from the table:\n\n1. The game played against the Philadelphia Flyers and its date.\n2. The team's record after that specific game.\n\nFirst, let's identify when the game against the Philadelphia Flyers was played:\n- According to the data, the game against the Philadelphia Flyers is listed in row 13 (since indexing starts at 0), with the \"opponent\" being \"philadelphia flyers,\" and it occurred on February 23rd. This matches the date mentioned in the claim.\n\nNext, we need to check the record after that specific game:\n- In the same row (row 13), the \"record\" is listed as \"40 - 11 - 10.\" \n\nThe conditions of the claim are fully supported by these entries: \n- The game against Philadelphia Flyers took place on February 23rd.\n- The team's record was indeed \"40 - 11 - 10\" after this game.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. \n\nHere are the relevant cells for verification:\n- Row index 13, column \"opponent,\" confirms the opponent is Philadelphia Flyers and matches the date.\n- Row index 13, column \"record,\" shows that the record was \"40 - 11 - 10\" after this game.\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
