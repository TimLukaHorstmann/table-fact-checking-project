We will look at each row in the \"data\" section of the json to identify any rows marked as \"postponed due to weather.\"\n\nLet's go through relevant rows:\n\n- **Row Index 5**: \n  - Date: September 6\n  - The entire entry is marked as \"postponed due to weather (september 7),\" indicating that this game was postponed due to weather.\n  \n- **Row Index 11**:\n  - Date: September 12\n  - Similarly, the entire entry is marked as \"postponed due to weather (september 14),\" confirming a postponement due to weather.\n\n3. We check if there are any additional rows indicating games postponed due to weather:\n\n- There are no other rows besides indices 5 and 11 with entries related to weather postponements.\n\nSince these are the only two instances of weather-related postponements, the claim is accurate.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We look for entries with descriptions indicating postponement.\n\n2. **Review the table data:**\n   - On September 6, there's an entry marked as \"postponed due to weather (september 7)\".\n   - On September 12, there's another entry marked as \"postponed due to weather (september 14)\".\n\n3. **Verify the claim details:**\n   - The claim states that games were postponed on September 26 and September 21.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify two main points:\n\n1. The attendance for the game on September 19.\n2. Whether this attendance is indeed the lowest compared to all other games listed in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n#### Checking Attendance for September 19\nFrom the JSON data:\n- Locate the row corresponding to \"september 19\".\n- This is the 18th entry (index 18) in the \"data\" list.\n- Check the \"attendance\" column for this row. The value is \"20202\".\n\nThe claim states that the attendance on September 19 was \"28757\". However, based on the table, it's actually \"20202\". Thus, this part of the claim is incorrect.\n\n#### Checking if This Is the Lowest Attendance\nWe need to compare \"20202\" with other non-postponed games' attendance:\n- Iterate through each row in the data list.\n- Ignore rows where the game was postponed (they have a specific note in all columns).\n- Extract and compare the attendance values for valid games.\n\nHere are the relevant attendances from the table:\n- September 1: 28393\n- September 2: 23150\n- September 3: 23122\n- September 5: 48302\n- September 7 (first game): 55797\n- September 7 (second game): 54980\n- September 8: 38921\n- September 9: 40554\n- September 10: 38665\n- September 11: 39994\n- September 13: 45105\n- September 14 (first game): 43950\n- September 14 (second game): 39776\n- September 16: 30319\n- September 17: 32821\n- September 18: 39070\n- **September 19: 20202** (This is indeed the lowest)\n- September 20: 28757\n- September 21: 28173\n- September 22: 36796\n- September 23: 39322\n- September 24: 41430\n- September 26: 44145\n- September 27: 45177\n- September 28: 44945\n\nThe lowest attendance is indeed \"20202\" for the game on September 19, confirming that it has the lowest attendance.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1. The claim about the attendance number (\"28757\") is incorrect.\n2. The claim about having the lowest attendance is correct in terms of comparison but incorrect regarding the stated attendance figure.\n\nThus, the overall claim as stated is **FALSE** because the specified attendance value \"28757\" does not match the actual lowest attendance value \"20202\".\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe relevant cells include:\n- The attendance for September 19 to verify the actual value.\n- Attendances of two other games with relatively low numbers to confirm it is indeed the lowest.",

Identify the row corresponding to September 7.\n2. Check the attendance value for that date.\n3. Compare this attendance value with all other games listed in the table.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant rows:**\n   - The entries for September 7 are:\n     - Row index 6 (game against Mets, doubleheader - 1)\n     - Row index 7 (game against Mets, doubleheader - 2)\n\n2. **Check attendance values for these games:**\n   - For row index 6: Attendance is \"55,797\".\n   - For row index 7: Attendance is \"54,980\".\n\n3. **Compare with other dates:**\n   - The attendance figures in the table are:\n     - September 1: 28,393\n     - September 2: 23,150\n     - September 3: 23,122\n     - September 5: 48,302\n     - September 8: 38,921\n     - September 9: **40,554** (This is the value mentioned in the claim.)\n     - September 10: 38,665\n     - September 11: 39,994\n     - September 13: 45,105\n     - September 14 (doubleheader):\n       - Row index 13: 43,950\n       - Row index 14: 39,776\n     - September 16: 30,319\n     - September 17: 32,821\n     - September 18: 39,070\n     - September 19: 20,202\n     - September 20: 28,757\n     - September 21: 28,173\n     - September 22: 36,796\n     - September 23: 39,322\n     - September 24: 41,430\n     - September 26: 44,145\n     - September 27: 45,177\n     - September 28: 44,945\n\n4. **Determine the lowest attendance:**\n   - The lowest attendance in the table is \"20,202\" on September 19.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim that the game on September 7 had the lowest attendance with \"40,554 attendees\" is false because the actual lowest attendance figure is \"20,202\" on September 19.
