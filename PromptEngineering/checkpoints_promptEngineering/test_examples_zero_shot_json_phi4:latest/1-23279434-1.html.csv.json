We need to find if any entry in the data matches this director for the corresponding title.\n\n3. **Air Date**: The claim specifies that the episode first aired on March 2, 1998. We need to check the air date for the episode with the matching title and director.\n\nNow, let's locate the relevant information in the table:\n\n- **Row Index**: From the data, we find the following entry:\n  - Row index: 15 (corresponding to series number 16)\n  - Title: \"forbidden fruits\"\n  - Directed by: Jeremy Kagan\n  - Original air date: March 2, 1998\n\nThe entry matches all components of the claim except for the minor difference in the title (\"forbidden fruit\" vs. \"forbidden fruits\"). Given that such a small discrepancy is often considered trivial and does not change the essence of the episode being referred to, we can reasonably conclude that the claim is true.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n- Row index 15, column \"title\"\n- Row index 15, column \"directed by\"\n- Row index 15, column \"original air date\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
