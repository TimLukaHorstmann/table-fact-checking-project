The key columns involved in this verification are:\n\n1. **venue**: We need to identify which game took place at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).\n2. **crowd**: We need to compare the attendance figures for all games to see if the MCG game had the largest crowd.\n\nLet's go through each relevant row of data, focusing on these columns:\n\n1. **Row 0**:\n   - Venue: \"glenferrie oval\" (not MCG)\n   - Crowd: 11,000\n\n2. **Row 1**:\n   - Venue: \"lake oval\" (not MCG)\n   - Crowd: 32,260\n\n3. **Row 2**:\n   - Venue: \"windy hill\" (not MCG)\n   - Crowd: 34,900\n\n4. **Row 3**:\n   - Venue: \"mcg\" (this is the MCG game)\n   - Crowd: 72,114\n\n5. **Row 4**:\n   - Venue: \"western oval\" (not MCG)\n   - Crowd: 25,345\n\n6. **Row 5**:\n   - Venue: \"brunswick street oval\" (not MCG)\n   - Crowd: 20,140\n\nNow, we compare the crowd sizes:\n\n- The game at MCG had a crowd of 72,114.\n- The largest crowd among the other games is 34,900 (from Row 2).\n\nSince the MCG game's attendance of 72,114 is indeed larger than any other listed in the table, the claim is supported.\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification are from:\n\n- Row 3, Column \"venue\" to confirm it was at MCG.\n- Row 3, Column \"crowd\" to get the crowd size for the MCG game.\n- Other rows' \"crowd\" columns to ensure no other game had a larger attendance.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"melbourne play at home on june 12 1965\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify two conditions:\n\n1. **Melbourne plays as a home team**: This involves checking the \"home team\" column for entries where the value is \"melbourne\".\n2. **The match occurs on June 12, 1965**: This requires examining the \"date\" column for matches with this specific date.\n\nWe'll go through each row of data to see if both conditions are met:\n\n- **Row 0**:\n  - Home team: \"hawthorn\"\n  - Date: \"12 june 1965\"\n  - Melbourne is not the home team, so this does not satisfy the claim.\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Home team: \"south melbourne\"\n  - Date: \"12 june 1965\"\n  - Melbourne is not the home team, so this does not satisfy the claim.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Home team: \"essendon\"\n  - Date: \"12 june 1965\"\n  - Melbourne is not the home team, so this does not satisfy the claim.\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Home team: \"melbourne\"\n  - Date: \"14 june 1965\"\n  - Although Melbourne is the home team, the date is June 14, not June 12. This does not satisfy the claim.\n\n- **Row 4** and **Row 5** are irrelevant as they have dates of June 14, 1965, which do not match the required date of June 12, 1965.\n\nAfter checking all rows, there is no instance where Melbourne plays at home on June 12, 1965. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are from:\n- Row 3: \"home team\" and \"date\"\n- Rows 0, 1, and 2 for the date verification\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
