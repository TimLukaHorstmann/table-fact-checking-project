    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"Paris Saint-Germain and Braga have the highest combined score of any match\" based on the provided table data in JSON format, we need to analyze each match's aggregate scores.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the Structure:**\n   - The JSON table consists of columns: `team 1`, `agg` (aggregate), `team 2`, `1st leg`, and `2nd leg`.\n   - Each entry in `data` represents a match with these details.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Data for Claim Verification:**\n   - The claim specifically concerns the aggregate score (`agg`) between \"Paris Saint-Germain\" and \"Braga\".\n   - We need to compare this aggregate score against all other matches in the table to verify if it is indeed the highest combined score.\n\n3. **Extracting Scores from the Table:**\n   - For each row, extract the aggregate scores:\n     1. Werder Bremen vs. Saint-\u00c9tienne: `3 - 2`\n     2. CSKA Moscow vs. Shakhtar Donetsk: `1 - 2`\n     3. Udinese vs. Zenit St. Petersburg: `2 - 1`\n     4. Paris Saint-Germain vs. Braga: `1 - 0`\n     5. Dynamo Kyiv vs. Metalist Kharkiv: `3 - 3 (a)`\n     6. Manchester City vs. Aalborg BK: `2 - 2 (4 - 3 p)`\n     7. Marseille vs. Ajax: `4 - 3`\n     8. Hamburg vs. Galatasaray: `4 - 3`\n\n4. **Calculating Total Combined Scores:**\n   - Werder Bremen vs. Saint-\u00c9tienne: \\(3 + 2 = 5\\)\n   - CSKA Moscow vs. Shakhtar Donetsk: \\(1 + 2 = 3\\)\n   - Udinese vs. Zenit St. Petersburg: \\(2 + 1 = 3\\)\n   - Paris Saint-Germain vs. Braga: \\(1 + 0 = 1\\)\n   - Dynamo Kyiv vs. Metalist Kharkiv: \\(3 + 3 = 6\\)\n   - Manchester City vs. Aalborg BK: \\(2 + 2 = 4\\) (Note: Penalties do not count in aggregate scores for combined score calculation)\n   - Marseille vs. Ajax: \\(4 + 3 = 7\\)\n   - Hamburg vs. Galatasaray: \\(4 + 3 = 7\\)\n\n5. **Comparison and Conclusion:**\n   - The highest combined score among the matches is 7, achieved by both Marseille vs. Ajax and Hamburg vs. Galatasaray.\n   - Paris Saint-Germain vs. Braga has a combined score of 1.\n\nGiven this analysis, the claim that \"Paris Saint-Germain and Braga have the highest combined score of any match\" is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n\n- The relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n  - Row 3 (index 3) for Paris Saint-Germain vs. Braga's aggregate score.\n  - All other rows to compare scores: Rows 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n\n### JSON Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"Marseille scored fewer goals during the first leg than Hamburg,\" we need to analyze the relevant cells in the provided table. The claim involves comparing the number of goals scored by Marseille and Hamburg in their respective first legs.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We are interested in the \"1st leg\" column for both Marseille and Hamburg.\n   \n2. **Locate the Rows:**\n   - Find the row corresponding to \"marseille\":\n     - Row index 6 has \"team 1\" as \"marseille\".\n   - Find the row corresponding to \"hamburg\":\n     - Row index 7 has \"team 1\" as \"hamburg\".\n\n3. **Extract First Leg Scores:**\n   - For Marseille (row index 6, column \"1st leg\"):\n     - The score is \"2 - 1\".
