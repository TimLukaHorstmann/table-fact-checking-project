Count how many times \"decision (majority)\" appears as the method for Usui's wins.\n\nLet's break this down step-by-step using the provided JSON table:\n\n- **Identify Winning Rows**: We will focus on rows where `res` is equal to \"win.\"\n  \n  The winning entries are located at row indices:\n  - Row 2: win against shinya kumazawa\n  - Row 3: win against sakae kasuya\n  - Row 4: win against daisuke ishizawa\n  - Row 5: win against eiji murayama\n  - Row 6: win against hiroki kita\n  - Row 9: win against manabu inoue\n  - Row 10: win against michihisa asano\n  - Row 12: win against naosuke mizoguchi\n  - Row 14: win against seigi fujioka\n  - Row 15: win against takeshi matsushita\n\n- **Check Method of Victory for Majority Decision**:\n  \n  We need to look at the `method` column for these rows and count occurrences of \"decision (majority).\"\n\n  - Row 2 (`method`: decision (unanimous)) \u2014 Not a majority.\n  - Row 3 (`method`: decision (majority)) \u2014 Count as one.\n  - Row 4 (`method`: decision (unanimous)) \u2014 Not a majority.\n  - Row 5 (`method`: decision (unanimous)) \u2014 Not a majority.\n  - Row 6 (`method`: decision (unanimous)) \u2014 Not a majority.\n  - Row 9 (`method`: decision (majority)) \u2014 Count as two.\n  - Row 10 (`method`: decision (unanimous)) \u2014 Not a majority.\n  - Row 12 (`method`: submission (armlock)) \u2014 Not a decision.\n  - Row 14 (`method`: decision (majority)) \u2014 Count as three.\n  - Row 15 (`method`: decision (majority)) \u2014 Counted already as maximum needed, but four in total.\n\nFrom the above analysis, \"decision (majority)\" is found for Usui's wins at row indices: 3, 9, and 14.
