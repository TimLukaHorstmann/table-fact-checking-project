    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"no 2 player have scored the same total number of goals\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to focus on the \"total\" column in each row. This column represents the sum of regular season and playoff games played by each player.\n\nHere's how we can verify the claim:\n\n1. Extract the values from the \"total\" column for each player:\n   - Bobby Hull: 666\n   - Stan Mikita: 600\n   - Steve Larmer: 451\n   - Denis Savard: 438\n   - Dennis Hull: 331\n   - Jeremy Roenick: 302\n   - Tony Amonte: 281\n   - Hubert Pit Martin: 269\n   - Bill Mosienko: 268\n   - Ken Wharram: 268\n\n2. Check for any duplicate values in the \"total\" column:\n   - The value 268 appears twice (for both Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram).\n\nSince there are two players with the same total number of games played, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are all the entries in the \"total\" column. Below is the JSON object that includes the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
