    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"after 1 round Gary Player be place t9,\" we need to evaluate whether this scenario is possible based on the provided table data.\n\nThe table contains golf tournament results after two rounds (as indicated by scores being sums, e.g., \"71 + 68\"). We will check Gary Player's performance after one round and his placement relative to other players after two rounds:\n\n1. **Identify Gary Player's Performance:**\n   - Gary Player's total score after two rounds is given as \"71 + 71 = 142.\"\n   - To find his score after one round, we need either his first or second-round score alone.\n\n2. **Examine the Structure of Scores in the Table:**\n   - Each player's scores are presented as \"Round1 + Round2 = Total\" and their placement is given under \"place.\"\n\n3. **Determine Gary Player's Score After One Round:**\n   - The table shows his total score after two rounds, but not individually for each round. We can assume the breakdown \"71 + 71 = 142\" indicates he scored 71 in both rounds.\n\n4. **Evaluate Placements and Scores of Others After Two Rounds:**\n   - Players with a total score of 144 are tied at placement t9 (Phil Rodgers and Don Whitt).\n   - Gary Player's total score after two rounds is 142, placing him at t4.\n\n5. **Hypothetical Placement After One Round:**\n   - If we consider Gary Player's score after one round as 71, he would need to be compared with scores of other players after their first round.\n   - However, the table does not provide individual round scores for any player except through total calculation.\n\n6. **Conclusion Based on Available Data:**\n   - Without explicit first-round scores, we can't definitively place Gary Player at t9 after one round based solely on his two-round score of 71-71 = 142.\n   - Given the information, it's not possible to confirm or deny that he would be tied for ninth after just one round without additional data.\n\nTherefore, the claim cannot be verified as true with the given table.
