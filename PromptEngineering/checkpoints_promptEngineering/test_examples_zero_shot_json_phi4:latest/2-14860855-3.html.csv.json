    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to assess two aspects of the table:\n\n1. **Frequency of Listing**: We must check if \"hb - honda\" appears more times than any other team in the \"team\" column.\n2. **Proportion of Listings**: We must verify if \"hb - honda\" appears in more than half of the total entries.\n\nLet's break down the steps needed to evaluate these conditions:\n\n### Step 1: Count Total Entries\nThe table contains a total of 12 rows, representing different years and configurations for motorbike classes. Therefore, we have 12 entries in total.\n\n### Step 2: Identify and Count Occurrences of \"hb - honda\"\nWe need to check each row to see if the team is \"hb - honda\":\n\n- Row Index 6: \"hb - honda\" (250cc)\n- Row Index 7: \"hb - honda\" (250cc)\n- Row Index 8: \"hb - honda\" (250cc)\n- Row Index 9: \"hb - honda\" (250cc)\n- Row Index 10: \"hb - honda\" (250cc)\n\nFrom this, we observe that \"hb - honda\" appears in 5 rows.\n\n### Step 3: Compare Frequency with Other Teams\nWe should ensure that no other team appears more than \"hb - honda\":\n\n- \"yamaha\": Appears in Rows 0, 1, and 2 \u2014 a total of 3 times.\n- \"suzuki\": Appears in Row 3 \u2014 a total of 1 time.\n- \"honda\": Appears in Row 4 (as \"honda\") \u2014 a total of 1 time.\n- \"romer - juchem\": Appears in Row 5 \u2014 a total of 1 time.\n\n\"hb - honda\" is indeed listed more often than any other team with its 5 occurrences.\n\n### Step 4: Check if \"hb - honda\" Is More Than Half\nMore than half of the entries would require appearances in more than 6 out of 12 rows (since \\( \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\)). Since \"hb - honda\" appears only 5 times, it does not meet this criterion.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim states that \"hb - honda be the most listed team, be in more than half of the list.\" While it is true that \"hb - honda\" is the most frequently listed team, it does not appear in more than half of the entries. Therefore, the entire claim is false.\n\nHere are the relevant cells to check these conditions:\n\n- **Relevant Cells for Frequency**: Rows 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 with \"team\" as \"hb - honda\".\n- **Relevant Cells for Total Count**: All rows (0 through 11) under \"team\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
