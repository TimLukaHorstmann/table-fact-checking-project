The number of losses they have.\n\nLet's break down these steps using the data provided in the table:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Opponents of Chuck Liddell with Decisions\n\nFrom the data, we need to identify all fighters whom Chuck Liddell has fought and where the result was a decision (either win or loss for Liddell).\n\n- **Jeremy Horn**:\n  - Result: Submission (Arm-triangle choke) against Liddell in UFC 19.\n  - Row index: 18\n  \n- **Vitor Belfort**: \n  - Result: Decision (unanimous) win for Liddell in UFC 37.5.\n  - Row index: 17\n\n- **Murilo Bustamante**:\n  - Result: Decision (unanimous) win for Liddell in UFC 33.\n  - Row index: 16\n  \n- **Amar Suloev**:\n  - Result: Decision (unanimous) win for Liddell in UFC 35.\n  - Row index: 15\n\n- **Jeff Monson**:\n  - Result: Decision (unanimous) win for Liddell in UFC 29.\n  - Row index: 14\n  \nThese are the fighters who faced Chuck Liddell and had a decision against him. The relevant columns here would be \"record\", \"opponent\" or equivalent data to identify these fights, but given our structured approach using row indices, we focus on opponents' names and outcomes.\n\n### Step 2: Count Losses for Each Opponent\n\nNow, let's count the total number of losses for each fighter who had a decision against Chuck Liddell:\n\n- **Jeremy Horn**:\n  - Row index: 18\n  - Record shows 7 wins and 1 loss.\n  \n- **Vitor Belfort**:\n  - No record provided in this dataset beyond his fight with Liddell.\n\n- **Murilo Bustamante**:\n  - No record provided in this dataset beyond his fight with Liddell.\n\n- **Amar Suloev**:\n  - No record provided in this dataset beyond his fight with Liddell.\n  \n- **Jeff Monson**:\n  - No record provided in this dataset beyond his fight with Liddell.\n\nFrom the data we have, only Jeremy Horn has a complete record available. The next step is to evaluate if he indeed has one of the fewest losses among those who faced Liddell by decision.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that \"Noe Hernandez\" has a joint fewest loss amongst fighters who lost a decision against Chuck Liddell. However, Noe Hernandez defeated Chuck Liddell in their encounter (UFC 17), so he cannot have had a decision against him. Therefore, the claim is false because Hernandez did not lose to Liddell by decision.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
