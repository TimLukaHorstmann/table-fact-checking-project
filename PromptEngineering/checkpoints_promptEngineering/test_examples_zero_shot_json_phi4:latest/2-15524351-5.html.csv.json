    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. There should be exactly 7 games played in North Carolina.\n2. All these games must occur at the same stadium.\n\nLet's analyze the data step-by-step based on these conditions:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Games Played in North Carolina\n\nWe look for entries where the \"location\" column contains \"nc\", indicating that the game was played in North Carolina.\n\n- **Row 0:** Location is \"groves stadium winston - salem, nc\". This indicates a game in North Carolina.\n- **Row 4:** Location is \"groves stadium winston - salem, nc\".\n- **Row 5:** Location is \"groves stadium winston - salem, nc\".\n- **Row 6:** Location is \"groves stadium winston - salem, nc\".\n- **Row 11:** Location is \"groves stadium winston - salem, nc\".\n\nThese rows (0, 4, 5, 6, and 11) represent games played in North Carolina. We have identified 5 such games so far.\n\n### Step 2: Verify if All Games are at the Same Stadium\n\nFor each game identified as being played in North Carolina, we check if they all occur at the same stadium:\n\n- **Row 0:** Location \"groves stadium winston - salem, nc\"\n- **Row 4:** Location \"groves stadium winston - salem, nc\"\n- **Row 5:** Location \"groves stadium winston - salem, nc\"\n- **Row 6:** Location \"groves stadium winston - salem, nc\"\n- **Row 11:** Location \"groves stadium winston - salem, nc\"\n\nAll these locations are \"groves stadium winston - salem, nc\", confirming that all identified games were at the same stadium.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Number of Games\n\nThe claim states there should be 7 games in North Carolina. However, we have only found 5 games meeting both conditions (played in North Carolina and at the same stadium).\n\nSince we do not find 7 such games, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are those from the \"location\" column for rows where games were played in North Carolina. These are:\n\n- Row index 0\n- Row index 4\n- Row index 5\n- Row index 6\n- Row index 11\n\nHere is the JSON output based on our analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
