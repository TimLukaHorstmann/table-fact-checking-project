This value is found in the row corresponding to \"Radom voivodeship\" with a row index of 13.\n  \n- Now check the area for Radom voivodeship:\n  - The \"Area km square (1998)\" for Radom is 7,295, not 6,266.\n\nSince the area does not match the claim, the statement is false. We will identify the relevant cells:\n\n- Relevant cell for \"No of commune (1999)\":\n  - Row index: 13\n  - Column name: \"No of commune (1999)\"\n\n- Relevant cell for \"Area km square (1998)\":\n  - Row index: 13\n  - Column name: \"Area km square (1998)\"\n\nThus, the JSON object with our findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"No of commune (1999)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Area km square (1998)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
