    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate if a crowd of 33,057 attended the week 6 game according to the table data.\n\nThe relevant conditions from the claim are:\n1. The attendance should be 33,057.\n2. This should correspond to the event in week 6.\n\nLet's analyze the provided JSON table:\n\n- Look at the \"week\" column to find the entry for week 6.\n- Check if the corresponding attendance matches the number given in the claim (33,057).\n\nFrom the data:\n- The row with `week` value of 6 is: `[6, \"october 16 , 1966\", \"oakland raiders\", \"l 34 - 13\", 33057]`\n- In this row, the attendance is indeed 33,057.\n\nThus, both conditions in the claim are satisfied. Therefore, the claim that \"33057 crowd attend the week 6 game\" is true.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification include:\n- The cell corresponding to `week` being 6.\n- The cell corresponding to `attendance` being 33,057 in the same row as `week` 6.\n\nHere are the indices and column names of these relevant cells:\n\n1. Row index: 6, Column name: \"week\"\n2. Row index: 6, Column name: \"attendance\"\n\nNow, we can construct the JSON response with this information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
