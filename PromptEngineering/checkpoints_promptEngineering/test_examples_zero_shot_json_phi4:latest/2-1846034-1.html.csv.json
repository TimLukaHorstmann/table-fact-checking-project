    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding Great Britain (GBR) in the table provided, we need to verify two specific pieces of information:\n\n1. Whether GBR received a total of 1 trophy.\n2. Whether this single trophy is specifically a bronze medal.\n\nThe claim states: \"Great Britain (GBR) received 1 trophy which be bronze.\" Let's break down the steps needed to verify each part of this claim:\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n**1. Verify Total Trophies for Great Britain (GBR):**\n\n- Identify the row corresponding to \"great britain (gbr)\" in the data.\n- Check the \"total\" column in this row to see if it equals 1.\n\nFrom the table:\n- The entry for GBR is at `row_index` 6.\n- In this row, the value under the \"total\" column is 1.\n\nThis confirms that Great Britain received a total of 1 trophy.\n\n**2. Verify Type of Trophy for Great Britain (GBR):**\n\n- Check if the medal count for GBR matches receiving one bronze and no gold or silver medals.\n- Specifically, check the columns: \"gold,\" \"silver,\" and \"bronze\" for this row to ensure:\n  - Gold is 0\n  - Silver is 0\n  - Bronze is 1\n\nFrom the table:\n- In `row_index` 6 for GBR:\n  - The value in the \"gold\" column is 0.\n  - The value in the \"silver\" column is 0.\n  - The value in the \"bronze\" column is 1.\n\nThis confirms that the single trophy received by Great Britain was indeed a bronze medal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are supported:\n- GBR received a total of 1 trophy.\n- This trophy is specifically a bronze medal.\n\nThus, the entire claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification are:\n\n- Total trophies: `row_index` 6 and \"total\"\n- Gold medals: `row_index` 6 and \"gold\"\n- Silver medals: `row_index` 6 and \"silver\"\n- Bronze medals: `row_index` 6 and \"bronze\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
