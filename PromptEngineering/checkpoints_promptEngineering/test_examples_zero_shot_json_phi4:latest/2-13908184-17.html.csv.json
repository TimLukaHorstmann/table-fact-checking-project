    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"right wing Scott Jessee be draft last in the draft\" is true or false, we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. **Scott Jessee's Position**: We need to confirm that Scott Jessee is listed as a \"right wing\".\n2. **Draft Order**: We need to check if Scott Jessee was drafted last (i.e., in round 14).\n\nLet's go through the relevant steps:\n\n### Step 1: Verify Scott Jessee's Position\n- Locate the entry for Scott Jessee in the table.\n- Check his position column to ensure it is \"right wing\".\n\nFrom the data:\n- Row index 10 contains \"scott jessee\" with the position listed as \"right wing\".\n\n### Step 2: Verify Draft Order\n- Identify which round Scott Jessee was drafted in.\n- Confirm that this round number corresponds to the last draft round, which is round 14.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Row index 10 shows that Scott Jessee was drafted in round 11.\n\n### Conclusion\nScott Jessee was drafted as a \"right wing\", but he was not the last pick (round 14); he was picked in round 11. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification are:\n- The cell containing Scott Jessee's position: row index 10, column name \"position\".\n- The cell containing Scott Jessee's draft round: row index 10, column name \"round\".\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"right wing\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
