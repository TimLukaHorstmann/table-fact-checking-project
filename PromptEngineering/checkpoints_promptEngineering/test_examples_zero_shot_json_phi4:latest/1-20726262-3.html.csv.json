Let's break down the verification process step-by-step using the table provided in JSON format:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: The columns relevant to our claim are \"usviewers (million)\" and \"production code\".\n\n2. **Find Episodes with 3.38 Million Viewers**:\n   - We need to locate the row(s) where the \"usviewers (million)\" column has the value \"3.38\". \n\n3. **Check Production Code for Matching Viewer Count**:\n   - For any row identified in step 2, we must verify that the \"production code\" matches \"2wab10\".\n\nLet's go through the data:\n\n- The table provides several rows with viewer counts and production codes.\n- We need to locate the row where the viewer count is \"3.38\". From the data:\n  - Row index 22 (23rd in sequence) has \"usviewers (million)\" as \"3.38\" and \"production code\" as \"2wab10\".\n\n4. **Verify Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the production code for the episode with 3.38 million viewers is \"2wab10\".\n   - We found that in row index 22, the viewer count is indeed \"3.38\" and the production code is \"2wab10\".\n\nThus, all conditions of the claim are satisfied.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"usviewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"production code\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

This occurs at `row_index` 10.\n\nNext, verify the number of US viewers for this episode:\n\n- Check the value in the \"usviewers (million)\" column for the row with index 10.\n- The value found here is \"3.38\".\n\nNow assess whether the number of viewers exceeds 4 million:\n\n- Since \"3.38\" is less than 4, the claim that it has more than 4 million viewers is false.\n\nThus, we conclude that the claim is FALSE.
