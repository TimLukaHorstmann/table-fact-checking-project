The claim specifically involves comparing the positions of two teams: Neman and Lokomotiv. Therefore, the column \"position in 2003\" is crucial for our evaluation.\n\nHere's how we can verify the claim:\n\n1. **Locate Neman in the Table**: We need to find the row where the team name is \"neman\". According to the data provided, this is at `row_index` 6:\n   - Row index: 6\n   - Position in 2003 for Neman: \"7\"\n\n2. **Locate Lokomotiv in the Table**: We need to find the row where the team name is \"lokomotiv\". According to the data provided, this is at `row_index` 14:\n   - Row index: 14\n   - Position in 2003 for Lokomotiv: \"first league , 1\"\n\nNow, we compare their positions:\n\n- Neman's position is \"7\".\n- Lokomotiv's position is \"first league, 1\".\n\nIn football (soccer) leagues, a lower numerical position indicates a higher rank. Therefore, being in the main league with position \"1\" is better than position \"7\". Furthermore, Lokomotiv was not even part of the main league; it was listed under \"first league\", indicating it was in a lower division.\n\nGiven this information:\n\n- Neman's position (7) is numerically higher than Lokomotiv's position (1), which means Neman had a better standing.\n- Additionally, since Lokomotiv was in the first league, its position is not directly comparable within the same context as Neman's.\n\nThus, based on the provided data and typical understanding of league standings:\n\nThe claim \"Neman have a higher position in 2003 than Lokomotiv\" is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells for this determination are:\n- The cell at `row_index` 6, column \"position in 2003\" for Neman.\n- The cell at `row_index` 14, column \"position in 2003\" for Lokomotiv.\n\nThe JSON object representing the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"position in 2003\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"position in 2003\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
