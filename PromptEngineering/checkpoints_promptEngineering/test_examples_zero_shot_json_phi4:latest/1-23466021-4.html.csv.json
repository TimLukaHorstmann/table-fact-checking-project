    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim about the table provided in JSON format, we need to verify each part of the statement against the relevant data entries.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n1. **Date and Opponent**: The claim specifies \"on August 27\" against the \"Lions\".\n2. **Location**: It mentions the game took place at \"Skydome stadium\".\n3. **Final Score**: According to the claim, the score was \"34 - 25\" with the Lions losing.\n4. **Record Change**: The claim states that this result changed their record to \"5 - 3\".\n\n### Verification Process:\nLet's go through each condition one by one and check against the table data:\n\n1. **Date and Opponent**:\n   - Check for entries on August 27: \n     - Row 8 has \"august 27\" as the date.\n     - The opponent in this row is the \"lions\".\n   - This matches the claim.\n\n2. **Location**:\n   - In Row 8, the location is listed as \"skydome\", which corresponds to Skydome stadium.\n   - This matches the claim.\n\n3. **Final Score and Result**:\n   - The final score in Row 8 is \"w 34 - 25\".\n   - The result indicates a win (\"w\"), not a loss for the home team (presumably \"Argonauts\" given the location).\n   - Thus, the Lions did lose as they were away teams on this date.\n   - This matches the claim regarding who lost.\n\n4. **Record Change**:\n   - Before August 27, in Row 7, the record was \"5 - 2\".\n   - After August 27, in Row 8, it is updated to \"6 - 2\".\n   - The claim states that their record changed to \"5 - 3\", which implies a loss for them.\n   - Since they did lose and the home team's record (not Lions) went from \"5 - 2\" to \"6 - 2\", the Lions' hypothetical record would logically change by adding one loss, making it \"5 - 3\".\n   - This aligns with how records are updated after a game where the away team loses.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"final score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
