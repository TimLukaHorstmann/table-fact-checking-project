    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to assess whether there exists a year where the team's win percentage was exactly 0.72 and they suffered a total of 23 losses. The relevant columns in the table for this verification are:\n\n1. \"Wins\" - to calculate the win percentage.\n2. \"Losses\" - to check if it matches the stated number.\n\nThe win percentage is calculated using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Win Percentage} = \\frac{\\text{Wins}}{\\text{Total Games}} \\]\nwhere Total Games = Wins + Losses.\n\nLet's go through each row in the data and perform these calculations:\n\n- For \"1980 - 81\": Wins = 51, Losses = 31, Total Games = 82. Win Percentage = \\( \\frac{51}{82} \\approx 0.62195 \\). (Does not match)\n  \n- For \"1998 - 99\": Wins = 27, Losses = 23, Total Games = 50. Win Percentage = \\( \\frac{27}{50} = 0.54 \\). (Losses match, but win percentage does not)\n\n- For \"2012 - 13\": Wins = 25, Losses = 57, Total Games = 82. Win Percentage = \\( \\frac{25}{82} \\approx 0.30488 \\). (Does not match)\n\nNo other rows have exactly 23 losses.\n\nThe row with 23 losses is \"1998 - 99\", but its win percentage does not equal 0.72. There are no rows where the win percentage equals 0.72 and the number of losses equals 23 simultaneously.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Row index 18: Column \"Losses\" (Value = 23)\n- Row index 19: Columns \"Wins\" (Value = 27) and \"Losses\" (Value = 23)\n\nThe JSON result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Losses\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim that \"The highest win percentage when there be 22 loss is 0.72,\" we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim specifies two conditions:\n   - The number of losses must be exactly 22.\n   - Among those entries, identify if the win percentage (calculated as Wins / (Wins + Losses)) is at its maximum value and verify that it's 0.72.\n\n2. **Data Analysis**:\n   - Identify rows in which the \"Losses\" column equals 22.\n   - For these identified rows, calculate the win percentage using the formula: \\( \\text{Win Percentage} = \\frac{\\text{Wins}}{\\text{Wins} + \\text{Losses}} \\).\n   - Determine if the maximum win percentage among those is indeed 0.72.\n\n3. **Extracting Data**:\n   - The relevant columns for this evaluation are \"Wins,\" \"Losses,\" and possibly another column that gives or helps calculate the win percentage, but we'll compute it ourselves as necessary.\n   \n4. **Perform Calculations**:\n\n   Let's examine each row in the dataset to find where \"Losses\" equals 22:\n   \n   - Row with Season \"2001-02\": Losses = 46 (not relevant)\n   - Row with Season \"2012-13\": Losses = 57 (not relevant)\n\n   Upon examination, there are no rows where losses equal exactly 22. Therefore, the specific condition of having 22 losses does not occur in any row.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   Since there is no instance of a team having exactly 22 losses in the dataset, it is impossible for there to be a win percentage associated with this number of losses. Thus, we cannot verify or validate the claim that \"0.72\" is the highest win percentage when there are 22 losses because such a scenario does not exist.\n\nTherefore, based on our analysis:\n\n- The answer to the claim is **FALSE**.\n- There are no relevant cells because there are no rows with exactly 22 losses.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
