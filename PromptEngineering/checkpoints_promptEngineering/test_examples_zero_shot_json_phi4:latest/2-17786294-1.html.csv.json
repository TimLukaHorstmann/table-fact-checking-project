    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim \"as monaco scored the most goals in the round of 16 in the 1983 - 84 Coupe de France,\" we need to analyze the data provided within the table:\n\n1. **Understanding the Table Structure**:\n   - The table has columns: \"team 1\", \"score\", \"team 2\", \"1st round\", and \"2nd round\".\n   - The relevant information for our claim lies in the \"score\" column because it provides the aggregate score of both rounds between two teams. \n   \n2. **Identifying Relevant Data**:\n   - We are interested in the total goals scored by \"as monaco\" during their match, as they appear in row 2.\n   - The relevant row for \"AS Monaco (d1)\" is: `[\"as monaco (d1)\", \"6 - 1\", \"as nancy (d1)\", \"2 - 0\", \"4 - 1\"]`\n   - This means AS Monaco scored a total of 6 goals against AS Nancy.\n\n3. **Comparing with Other Teams**:\n   - We need to compare the total goals scored by AS Monaco with those scored by other teams in their respective matches.\n   - For each row, extract the total goals scored by \"team 1\" from the \"score\" column and compare:\n\n     | Team 1               | Total Goals Scored |\n     |----------------------|--------------------|\n     | RC Lens (D1)         | 1                  |\n     | FC Rouen (D1)        | 2                  |\n     | AS Monaco (D1)       | 6                  |\n     | Girondins de Bordeaux (D1) | 2            |\n     | FC Nantes (D1)       | 4                  |\n     | AS Cannes (D2)       | 4                  |\n     | Sporting Toulon Var (D1) | 2              |\n     | FC Metz (D1)         | 5                  |\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - From the table, it is evident that \"AS Monaco\" scored 6 goals in total.\n   - No other team scored more than 6 goals in their respective matches.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim is TRUE because AS Monaco did score the most goals among all teams listed in their match during the round of 16 according to the provided data.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two key components from the table:\n\n1. **Aggregate Score**: Check if FC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnais have an aggregate score of 4 - 4.\n2. **Away Goal Rule Requirement**: Determine if the match must be decided by the away goal rule based on their scores in each round.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n#### Checking Aggregate Score:\n- The relevant row for FC Nantes vs. Olympique Lyonnais is found under \"FC nantes (d1)\" and \"olympique lyonnais (d2)\".\n- The aggregate score is given directly as \"4 - 4\" in the \"score\" column.\n\n#### Checking Scores by Round:\n- The first-round score between FC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnais is \"0 - 0\".\n- The second-round score is \"4 - 4\".\n\n### Away Goal Rule Analysis:\nThe away goal rule states that if two teams are tied on aggregate in a knockout competition, the team with more goals scored away from home wins.\n\n- **First Round (Home for FC Nantes, Away for Olympique Lyonnais)**: \n  - Score: \"0 - 0\"\n  - Goals for Olympique Lyonnais at FC Nantes' ground: 0\n\n- **Second Round (Away for FC Nantes, Home for Olympique Lyonnais)**:\n  - Score: \"4 - 4\"\n  - Goals for FC Nantes at Olympique Lyonnais' ground: 4\n  - Goals for Olympique Lyonnais at their own ground: 4\n\nSince both teams scored an equal number of goals away from home (0 each), the away goal rule does not decide the match. Instead, the aggregate score remains tied.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim that FC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnaise \"tie on aggregate with a score of 4 - 4\" is true. However, the requirement for the match to be decided by the away goal rule is false because neither team scored more away goals than the other.\n\nTherefore, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The row index for FC Nantes vs. Olympique Lyonnais is 4.\n- Relevant columns are \"score\", \"1st round\", and \"2nd round\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2nd round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We'll inspect each match:\n\n- **RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg**: \n  - 1st Round: 1 - 0\n  - 2nd Round: 0 - 0\n\n- **FC Rouen vs Stade Lavallois**:\n  - 1st Round: 1 - 0\n  - 2nd Round: 1 - 3\n\n- **AS Monaco vs AS Nancy**:\n  - 1st Round: 2 - 0\n  - 2nd Round: 4 - 1\n\n- **Girondins de Bordeaux vs FC Mulhouse**:\n  - 1st Round: 0 - 1\n  - 2nd Round: 2 - 2\n\n- **FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais**: \n  - 1st Round: 0 - 0\n  - 2nd Round: 4 - 4\n\n- **AS Cannes vs FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard**:\n  - 1st Round: 3 - 0\n  - 2nd Round: 1 - 1\n\n- **Sporting Toulon Var vs En Avant Guingamp**:\n  - 1st Round: 2 - 0\n  - 2nd Round: 0 - 1\n\n- **FC Metz vs Besan\u00e7on RC**:\n  - 1st Round: 4 - 0\n  - 2nd Round: 1 - 1\n\nThe highest scoring leg is the 1st round of FC Metz vs Besan\u00e7on RC with a score of 4 - 0 (total 4 goals). There is no leg where 8 or more goals were scored.\n\n### Checking Highest Aggregate Score for a Match\n\nNow, we compute the aggregate scores for each match and find which has the highest total:\n\n- **RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg**: 1 - 0 + 0 - 0 = 1 - 0 (Aggregate: 1 goal)\n- **FC Rouen vs Stade Lavallois**: 1 - 0 + 1 - 3 = 2 - 3 (Aggregate: 5 goals)\n- **AS Monaco vs AS Nancy**: 2 - 0 + 4 - 1 = 6 - 1 (Aggregate: 7 goals)\n- **Girondins de Bordeaux vs FC Mulhouse**: 0 - 1 + 2 - 2 = 2 - 3 (Aggregate: 5 goals)\n- **FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais**: 0 - 0 + 4 - 4 = 4 - 4 (Aggregate: 8 goals)\n- **AS Cannes vs FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard**: 3 - 0 + 1 - 1 = 4 - 1 (Aggregate: 5 goals)\n- **Sporting Toulon Var vs En Avant Guingamp**: 2 - 0 + 0 - 1 = 2 - 1 (Aggregate: 3 goals)\n- **FC Metz vs Besan\u00e7on RC**: 4 - 0 + 1 - 1 = 5 - 1 (Aggregate: 6 goals)\n\nThe highest aggregate score is indeed for FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais with a total of 8 goals.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The claim about the highest scoring leg being 8 goals does not hold, as no single leg has 8 or more goals.\n- However, the highest aggregate score for a match is correctly identified as 8 goals in the FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais game.\n\nGiven that only one condition of the claim (highest aggregate score) is true while the other (highest scoring leg) is false, the overall claim is **FALSE**.\n\nHere's the JSON object representing this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2nd round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Instead, there are matches involving \"fc nantes\" and another involving \"besan\u00e7on rc.\"\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n1. **Identify the Highest Scoring Leg:**\n   - Check each leg (1st round and 2nd round) for the number of goals scored.\n   - The highest scoring legs in the table are:\n     - \"fc metz vs besan\u00e7on rc\" with 4-0 in the 1st round.\n     - \"as monaco vs as nancy\" with 4-1 in the 2nd round.\n\n2. **Identify the Highest Aggregate Score:**\n   - Calculate the aggregate score for each match by summing the goals from both rounds.\n   - The matches and their aggregates are:\n     - \"rc lens (d1) vs rc strasbourg (d1)\": 1-0 + 0-0 = 1-0\n     - \"fc rouen (d1) vs stade lavallois (d1)\": 1-0 + 1-3 = 2-3\n     - \"as monaco (d1) vs as nancy (d1)\": 2-0 + 4-1 = 6-1\n     - \"girondins de bordeaux (d1) vs fc mulhouse (d2)\": 0-1 + 2-2 = 2-3\n     - \"fc nantes (d1) vs olympique lyonnais (d2)\": 0-0 + 4-4 = 4-4\n     - \"as cannes (d2) vs fc sochaux - montb\u00e9liard (d1)\": 3-0 + 1-1 = 4-1\n     - \"sporting toulon var (d1) vs en avant guingamp (d2)\": 2-0 + 0-1 = 2-1\n     - \"fc metz (d1) vs besan\u00e7on rc (d2)\": 4-0 + 1-1 = 5-1\n\n   - The highest aggregate score is 6-1 for the match \"as monaco vs as nancy.\"\n\n3. **Check Specific Match Mentioned:**\n   - There is no direct match between \"fc nantes\" and \"besan\u00e7on rc.\"\n   - The match involving \"fc nantes\" has an aggregate of 4-4.\n   - The match involving \"besan\u00e7on rc\" has an aggregate of 5-1.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The claim states that the highest scoring leg and highest aggregate score total 8 goals, specifically mentioning \"fc nantes vs besan\u00e7on rc.\"\n- The highest aggregate score is 6-1 (total 7 goals), not 8.\n- There is no match between \"fc nantes\" and \"besan\u00e7on rc.\"\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For the highest scoring leg: \n  - Row index 7, Column name \"1st round\"\n  - Row index 2, Column name \"2nd round\"\n- For the highest aggregate score:\n  - Row index 2, Column name \"score\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2nd round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
