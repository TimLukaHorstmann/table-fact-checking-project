    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about \"Potter Co in Copiah\" being \"the first project proposed, but the last to be listed\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table:\n\n1. **Identify \"Proposed\" Dates:**\n   - We need to find the earliest \"proposed\" date among all entries.\n   - Relevant column: \"proposed\".\n\n2. **Identify \"Listed\" Dates:**\n   - We need to determine if \"Potter Co\" is listed last among those that have a \"listed\" date.\n   - Relevant column: \"listed\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Check Proposed Dates:**\n\n   - American Creosote Works, Inc.: 06 / 14 / 2001\n   - Chemfax, Inc.: 06 / 23 / 1993\n   - Davis Timber Company: 05 / 11 / 2000\n   - Flowood Site: 09 / 08 / 1983\n   - Newsom Brothers/Old Reichhold Chemicals, Inc.: 10 / 15 / 1984\n   - Picayune Wood Treating: 03 / 08 / 2004\n   - Potter Co: **05 / 10 / 1993**\n   - Sonford Products: 09 / 27 / 2006\n   - Walcotte Chemical Co Warehouses: Cleanup completed before formal creation of NPL\n\n   The earliest proposed date is for \"Walcotte Chemical Co Warehouses\" (cleanup completed before the formal creation of NPL), not Potter Co.\n\n2. **Check Listed Dates:**\n\n   - American Creosote Works, Inc.: 09 / 13 / 2001\n   - Chemfax, Inc.: Not listed\n   - Davis Timber Company: 07 / 27 / 2000\n   - Flowood Site: 09 / 21 / 1984\n   - Newsom Brothers/Old Reichhold Chemicals, Inc.: 06 / 10 / 1986\n   - Picayune Wood Treating: 07 / 22 / 2004\n   - **Potter Co**: Not listed\n   - Sonford Products: 03 / 07 / 2007\n   - Walcotte Chemical Co Warehouses: Cleanup completed before formal creation of NPL\n\n   \"Sonford Products\" is the last to be listed on 03 / 07 / 2007.

    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim regarding the construction completion at two specific sites from the provided table, we need to focus on the relevant information:\n\n1. **Claim Analysis**: The claim states that construction was completed during the same time frame of 1993 for both \"flowood site\" and \"newsom brothers / old reichhold chemicals, inc\".\n\n2. **Relevant Data Extraction**:\n   - For each entry in the data, we need to check the \"construction completed\" column.\n   - Identify rows associated with \"flowood site\" and \"newsom brothers / old reichhold chemicals, inc\".\n   \n3. **Data Verification**:\n   - **Flowood Site**: The row for this site shows construction was completed on 09/17/1993.\n   - **Newsom Brothers / Old Reichhold Chemicals, Inc**: The row indicates that construction was completed on 08/08/1997.\n\n4. **Comparison**:\n   - For the claim to be true, both sites must have their \"construction completed\" dates within the same time frame of 1993.\n   - While the flowood site's construction completion date is in 1993 (09/17), the newsom brothers' site has a completion date in 1997 (08/08).\n   \n5. **Conclusion**: Since the construction completion for \"newsom brothers / old reichhold chemicals, inc\" did not occur in 1993 but rather in 1997, the claim is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - Row index 3 (\"Flowood Site\") with column name \"construction completed\".\n   - Row index 4 (\"Newsom Brothers / Old Reichhold Chemicals, Inc\") with column name \"construction completed\".\n\nBased on this analysis, here's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"construction completed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"construction completed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
