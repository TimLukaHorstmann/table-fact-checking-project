    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to analyze the data in the provided table and compare it with the statement.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"only Canada won more than 1 medal in football in the 2012 Summer Olympics.\"\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Check Each Nation's Medal Count:**\n   - The table provides the number of gold, silver, bronze, and total medals for each nation.\n   - We need to find out if any nation has a \"total\" count greater than 1.\n\n2. **Examine Relevant Rows:**\n   - For Mexico:\n     - Total Medals = 1\n   - For United States:\n     - Total Medals = 1\n   - For Brazil:\n     - Total Medals = 1\n   - For Japan:\n     - Total Medals = 1\n   - For Canada:\n     - Total Medals = 1\n   - For South Korea:\n     - Total Medals = 1\n\n3. **Conclusion from Data:**\n   - None of the nations listed (Mexico, United States, Brazil, Japan, Canada, South Korea) have more than 1 total medal.\n   - The \"total\" row confirms there are only 6 medals distributed among these countries.\n\n4. **Verify Claim Against Table:**\n   - The claim mentions \"Canada won more than 1 medal,\" but according to the table, Canada has exactly 1 medal.\n   - Therefore, no nation in the list has more than 1 medal.\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe claim is FALSE because no nation listed, including Canada, has won more than 1 medal according to the data.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nWe need to check the \"total\" column for each nation to verify their total medal count:\n\n- Mexico: {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n- United States: {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n- Brazil: {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n- Japan: {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n- Canada: {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n- South Korea: {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
