This corresponds to `row_index` 14 in zero-based indexing because the first entry starts at index 0.\n\n3. **Check Opponent Name:**\n   - In this row, examine the value under the \"opponent\" column. The opponent listed for game 75 is \"minnesota north stars.\"\n\n4. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the opponent for game 75 should be the \"minnesota north star.\"\n   - The table lists \"minnesota north stars,\" not \"minnesota north star.\" This is a singular vs. plural discrepancy.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the table lists \"minnesota north stars\" and the claim specifies \"minnesota north star,\" there's a minor difference in wording (singular vs. plural), leading us to determine that the exact wording of the claim does not match the data.\n   - Therefore, based on this discrepancy, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells for verifying this are:\n     - The cell in the row corresponding to game 75 under the \"game\" column.\n     - The cell in the same row under the \"opponent\" column.\n\nBased on these observations, the JSON response should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Identify games that occur after March 2.\n2. Check if any of these games have \"Minnesota North Stars\" as the opponent before Game 75.\n\n### Steps to Verify\n\n1. **Identify Games After March 2:**\n   - The relevant column for determining the date is \"march.\"\n   - Any game with a \"march\" value greater than 2 should be considered after March 2.\n   \n2. **Check Opponent Before Game 75:**\n   - We need to check if any of these games (after March 2) have \"Minnesota North Stars\" listed as the opponent before reaching Game 75.\n\n3. **Verify Game 75 and Beyond:**\n   - Ensure that \"Minnesota North Stars\" is indeed the opponent in Game 75, which should be consistent with the claim.\n\n### Verification Against Data\n\nLet's examine each row to verify these conditions:\n\n- **Rows after March 2 (March > 2):** \n  - Row 65 (Game 65, Date: March 5)\n  - Row 66 (Game 66, Date: March 8)\n  - Row 67 (Game 67, Date: March 11)\n  - Row 68 (Game 68, Date: March 12)\n  - Row 69 (Game 69, Date: March 15)\n  - Row 70 (Game 70, Date: March 16)\n  - Row 71 (Game 71, Date: March 18)\n  - Row 72 (Game 72, Date: March 19)\n  - Row 73 (Game 73, Date: March 23)\n  - Row 74 (Game 74, Date: March 25)\n  - Row 75 (Game 75, Date: March 26) \n  - Row 76 (Game 76, Date: March 29)\n\n- **Opponent Check Before Game 75:**\n  - For Rows 65 to 74, the opponent is not \"Minnesota North Stars.\"\n  \n- **Verify Opponent in Game 75:**\n  - In Row 75, the opponent is indeed \"Minnesota North Stars.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is true because:\n- There are no games with \"Minnesota North Stars\" as an opponent after March 2 until we reach Game 75.\n- In Game 75, the opponent is \"Minnesota North Stars.\"\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nWe need to list relevant cells for verification:\n\n1. **Games After March 2:**\n   - Rows where \"march\" > 2: 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76\n\n2. **Opponent Check Before Game 75:**\n   - Columns \"opponent\" in Rows 65 to 74.\n\n3. **Game 75 Opponent Verification:**\n   - Row 75, Column \"opponent\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"march\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"march\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"march\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"march\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"march\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"march\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"march\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"march\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"march\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"march\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"march\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"march\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
