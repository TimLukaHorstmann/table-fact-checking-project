    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to verify two key aspects from the table:\n\n1. **Date and Opponent**: The claim specifies \"on November 22\" against \"Chicago\". We must find this specific match in the data.\n\n2. **Home Loss Count**: The claim states that this game was Colorado's third home loss of the season. We need to count all previous home losses for Colorado up to and including this date.\n\n**Step-by-step Verification:**\n\n1. **Locate November 22 Match**:\n   - Check each entry in the \"data\" array for a match on \"November 22\".\n   - Find the row where \"date\" is \"november 22\", \"visitor\" is \"chicago\", and \"home\" is \"colorado\".\n\n2. **Verify Game Result**:\n   - Ensure that the result indicates a loss for Colorado, i.e., the score should be in favor of Chicago.\n\n3. **Count Home Losses Prior to November 22**:\n   - Identify all games where Colorado was the home team (column \"home\" is \"colorado\").\n   - Count how many of these games were losses for Colorado up to and including November 22.\n   - A loss is indicated by a score less than that of the visitor.\n\n**Relevant Data Extraction:**\n\n- **Row Index 10**: Matches the date \"november 22\", with \"chicago\" as the visitor and \"colorado\" as the home team.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Colorado playing a total of 11 away games in November during the 1995-96 season is true or false, we need to analyze the data provided in the table.\n\n### Table Analysis:\n\nThe table contains information for each game with columns:\n- `date`: The date on which the game was played.\n- `visitor`: The team visiting the home team's venue.\n- `score`: The score of the game.\n- `home`: The home team playing at its own venue.\n- `record`: Colorado's record after the game.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n\nThe claim states that \"colorado play a total of 11 away game during the month of november during the 1995 - 96 season.\"\n\nTo verify this, we need to count how many times Colorado was listed as the visitor (i.e., playing an away game) in November.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: Look for rows where Colorado is listed as the `visitor`.\n2. **Count These Instances**: Count how many such instances exist.\n3. **Compare with Claim**: Check if this count matches 11, as stated in the claim.\n\n### Verification:\n\nLet's go through each row and identify when Colorado is the visitor:\n\n- Row 0: Visitor is \"calgary\" (not Colorado)\n- Row 1: Visitor is \"colorado\"\n- Row 2: Visitor is \"colorado\"\n- Row 3: Visitor is \"dallas\" (not Colorado)\n- Row 4: Visitor is \"colorado\"\n- Row 5: Visitor is \"colorado\"\n- Row 6: Visitor is \"colorado\"\n- Row 7: Visitor is \"calgary\" (not Colorado)\n- Row 8: Visitor is \"edmonton\" (not Colorado)\n- Row 9: Visitor is \"chicago\" (not Colorado)\n- Row 10: Visitor is \"montreal\" (not Colorado)\n- Row 11: Visitor is \"colorado\"\n- Row 12: Visitor is \"colorado\"\n- Row 13: Visitor is \"new jersey\" (not Colorado)\n\n### Count of Away Games:\n\nFrom the analysis, Colorado was listed as the visitor in rows 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 11, and 12. This totals to 7 away games.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that Colorado played 11 away games, but based on the table, they played only 7 away games in November.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"FALSE\".\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two parts of the statement:\n1. Colorado picked up a total of 9 wins in November.\n2. Colorado had 1 tie in November.\n\nWe will analyze each game involving Colorado to extract this information. The relevant column for determining wins and ties from the data provided is \"score\", where the format is \"team1 - team2\" with Colorado being either \"visitor\" or \"home\". If Colorado is listed first (as the visitor), they are considered the away team, and if second, as the home team.\n\nLet's go through each relevant row:\n\n- **November 3:** Colorado (5 - 2) Winnipeg  \n  Colorado wins. Record becomes 9 - 3 - 1 after this game.\n  \n- **November 5:** Colorado (7 - 3) Chicago  \n  Colorado wins. Record becomes 10 - 3 - 1 after this game.\n\n- **November 9:** DALLAS (1 - 1) COLORADO  \n  Tie for Colorado. Record becomes 10 - 3 - 2 after this game.\n\n- **November 11:** Colorado (8 - 4) Vancouver  \n  Colorado wins. Record becomes 11 - 3 - 2 after this game.\n  \n- **November 15:** Colorado (3 - 7) Anaheim  \n  Colorado loses.

Record becomes 13 - 4 - 3 after this game.\n  \n- **November 22:** Chicago (2 - 6) COLORADO  \n  Colorado wins. Record becomes 14 - 4 - 3 after this game.\n\n- **November 25:** COLORADO (2 - 2) Montreal  \n  Tie for Colorado. Record becomes 14 - 4 - 4 after this game.\n  \n- **November 28:** Colorado (7 - 3) NY Islanders  \n  Colorado wins.
