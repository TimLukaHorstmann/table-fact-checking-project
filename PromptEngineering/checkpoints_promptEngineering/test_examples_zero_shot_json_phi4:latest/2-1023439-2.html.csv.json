    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify the following conditions against the given table:\n\n1. **Year Check**: The year must be 1986.\n2. **US R&B Value**: The value for \"us r&b\" should be 9 when these conditions are met.\n3. **US Dance Value**: When the above condition is true, the value for \"us dance\" should be 6.\n\nLet's examine the table:\n\n- We need to find rows where the year is 1986.\n  \n  - The first relevant row with year 1986:\n    - Title: \"under the influence\"\n    - Year: 1986\n    - US R&B: 9\n    - US Dance: 6\n\nThis matches the conditions given in the claim. Specifically, when the value for \"us r&b\" is 9, the corresponding value for \"us dance\" is indeed 6.\n\nNext, let's identify the relevant cells:\n\n- For year 1986 and title \"under the influence\":\n  - Row index: 2\n  - Column \"year\": Value matches 1986 (though not directly part of verification)\n  - Column \"us r&b\": Value is 9\n  - Column \"us dance\": Value is 6\n\nThus, the relevant cells for verifying the claim are:\n- Row index 2, column \"us r&b\"\n- Row index 2, column \"us dance\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us r&b\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim regarding the chart position of \"Under The Influence\" in the US for the years 1985 and 1986, we need to examine relevant data points from the provided table:\n\n1. **Claim Analysis:**\n   - The claim states that \"under the influence\" charted at 56 in the US in both 1985 and 1986.\n\n2. **Table Structure:**\n   - Columns include: `year`, `title`, `us`, `us r&b`, `us dance`.\n\n3. **Relevant Data Extraction:**\n   - We need to find entries with the title \"Under The Influence\" and check their US chart positions for both 1985 and 1986.\n   \n4. **Checking Each Year:**\n\n   - For **1985**:\n     - There is no entry in the table where `year` is 1985 and `title` is \"under the influence\". Thus, we cannot confirm its position.\n\n   - For **1986**:\n     - Locate the row with `year` = 1986 and `title` = \"under the influence\".\n     - In this row, check the `us` column for the chart position.\n     - The data shows: `[1986, \"under the influence\", \"56\", \"9\", \"6\"]`. This indicates that in 1986, \"Under The Influence\" charted at 56 in the US.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is only partially supported by the table. It correctly states the position for 1986 but does not have any data to confirm the same for 1985.\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE because it incorrectly includes the year 1985 as having a chart position of 56.\n\n6. **Identifying Relevant Cells:**\n   - For verifying 1986: The relevant cell has `row_index` = 2 and `column_name` = \"us\".\n\nBased on this analysis, here's the final JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
