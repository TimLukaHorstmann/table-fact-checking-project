Whelan has scored exactly 3 goals in the FA Cup.\n2. No other player has scored 3 or more goals in the FA Cup.\n\n### Steps:\n\n#### Step 1: Verify Whelan's Goals\n- We need to find the row corresponding to \"whelan\" and check the value under the \"fa cup\" column.\n- From the table, \"whelan\" is at `row_index` 1, with a value of 3 in the \"fa cup\" column.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"whelan be the only player to score 3 goal in any competition\" is true or false, we need to analyze the given table and verify if Whelan is indeed the sole player with a count of 3 goals in any single competition.\n\nHere's how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure:**\n   - The table has four columns: \"name\", \"league\", \"fa cup\", \"league cup\", and \"total\".\n   - Each row represents a player, and the numbers indicate the number of goals scored in each competition.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data for Verification:**\n   - We need to check if any player other than Whelan has scored 3 or more goals in any single competition (\"league\", \"fa cup\", or \"league cup\").\n\n3. **Examine Each Row:**\n   - Look at the values under each of the columns \"league\", \"fa cup\", and \"league cup\" for all players.\n   - Specifically, we need to identify if there is any value greater than 3 in these columns.\n\n4. **Analyze Whelan's Data:**\n   - According to the table:\n     - Whelan has scored 4 goals in the \"league\".\n     - He has also scored 3 goals in the \"fa cup\".\n\n5. **Check Other Players' Data:**\n   - For each player, check if there is any value greater than or equal to 3 in any of the columns (\"league\", \"fa cup\", \"league cup\").\n   - From the table:\n     - Bok\u0161i\u0107 has scored 8 goals in the \"league\".\n     - N\u00e9meth has scored 3 goals in both \"fa cup\" and \"league cup\".\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both Bok\u0161i\u0107 and N\u00e9meth have scored at least 3 goals in a single competition, which means Whelan is not the only player to achieve this.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n7. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - For Whelan:\n     - Row index 1, \"league\" column (value 4).\n     - Row index 1, \"fa cup\" column (value 3).\n   - For Bok\u0161i\u0107:\n     - Row index 0, \"league\" column (value 8).\n   - For N\u00e9meth:\n     - Row index 2, \"fa cup\" column (value 3).\n     - Row index 2, \"league cup\" column (value 2).\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.
