    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant columns in the table: `week`, `date`, `opponent`, `location`, `final score`, and `record`. The key part of the claim is \"the Argonauts lose 7 games in a row during one stretch.\"\n\nThe following steps will guide us through verifying this claim:\n\n1. **Identify Losses:** We need to find consecutive losses by examining the `final score` column for entries where the score starts with an \"L\" (indicating a loss) and the `record` reflects a loss.\n\n2. **Check Consecutive Games:** We will track the sequence of these losses in terms of their order in weeks, as provided in the `week` column. \n\n3. **Verify Continuity Across Weeks:** The claim states that there is a single stretch (uninterrupted series) where 7 consecutive games were lost.\n\nLet's evaluate each row to identify losses:\n\n- Row 0: Loss (`L 44 - 7`) -> Record: \"0 - 1 - 0\"\n- Row 2: Loss (`L 31 - 24`) -> Record: \"1 - 2 - 0\"\n- Row 3: Loss (`L 26 - 17`) -> Record: \"1 - 3 - 0\"\n- Row 4: Loss (`L 24 - 21`) -> Record: \"1 - 4 - 0\"\n- Row 5: Loss (`L 17 - 14`) -> Record: \"1 - 5 - 0\"\n- Row 6: Loss (`L 28 - 4`) -> Record: \"1 - 6 - 0\"\n- Row 7: Loss (`L 14 - 10`) -> Record: \"1 - 7 - 0\"\n- Row 8: Loss (`L 28 - 15`) -> Record: \"1 - 8 - 0\"\n\nWe observe the following consecutive losses in terms of weeks:\n- Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7\n\nThis sequence confirms a stretch of 7 consecutive losses.\n\nNow, check if there's any interruption between these games. The games span from Week 1 to Week 8 (two games in Week 8). Since no wins are recorded between these weeks until after the seventh loss in week 7, we confirm that the Argonauts lost all seven consecutively without any interruption.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this are those corresponding to losses and their records:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"final score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"final score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"final score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"final score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"final score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"final score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"final score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We are particularly interested in rows where the opponent is \"rough riders\".\n\n2. **Extract Data for Rough Riders Games:**\n   - Row 0: Week 1, Date August 19, Opponent \"rough riders\"\n   - Row 4: Week 5, Date September 20, Opponent \"rough riders\"\n   - Row 5: Week 6, Date September 27, Opponent \"rough riders\"\n   - Row 8: Week 9, Date October 18, Opponent \"rough riders\"\n   - Row 10: Week 10, Date October 25, Opponent \"rough riders\"\n\n3. **Check Consecutiveness of Weeks:**\n   - The weeks where the Argonauts played against the Rough Riders are: 1, 5, 6, 9, and 10.\n   - Check for consecutive weeks:\n     - Week 1 to Week 5: Not consecutive\n     - Week 5 to Week 6: Consecutive\n     - Week 6 to Week 9: Not consecutive\n     - Week 9 to Week 10: Consecutive\n\n4. **Determine the Claim's Validity:**\n   - The games in weeks 1 and 5 are non-consecutive.\n   - However, the games in weeks 5 and 6 are consecutive.\n   - Similarly, the games in weeks 9 and 10 are also consecutive.\n   - Therefore, not all instances of playing \"rough riders\" are in non-consecutive weeks.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is **FALSE** because there are at least two instances (weeks 5-6 and 9-10) where the Argonauts played the Rough Riders in consecutive weeks.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nWe need to list the relevant cells that were used to verify this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
