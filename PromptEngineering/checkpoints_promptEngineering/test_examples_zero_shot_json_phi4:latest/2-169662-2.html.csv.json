Specifically, we should focus on identifying individuals with a record indicating no losses.\n\n**Steps to verify the claim:**\n\n1. **Understand the Data Structure:** \n   - The data is structured as follows:\n     - Each row corresponds to a fight.\n     - Columns include `record`, which shows wins-losses-draws for each fighter.\n     - Other columns such as `opponent` and `result` are also available, but they are not immediately relevant to verifying the claim.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Records:**\n   - The column of interest is \"record.\" We need to find rows where a fighter's record shows zero losses (indicated by '0' in the loss position).\n\n3. **Extract Zero-Loss Fighters:**\n   - Go through each row and extract fighters with a record indicating zero losses.\n   - Keep track of unique fighters who have achieved this.\n\n4. **Count Unique Fighters with Zero Losses:**\n   - Count how many unique fighters have records indicating zero losses throughout the table.\n\n5. **Verify Claim:**\n   - If exactly one unique fighter has zero losses, the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\n**Analysis of the Table:**\n\n- Row 18: Record \"1-0\" (Wes Albritton) indicates no losses.\n- Row 19: Record \"1-0\" (Wes Albritton) after winning his first fight also shows no losses.\n- No other rows indicate a fighter with a record of zero losses throughout the dataset.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly Wes Albritton has a record indicating zero losses.

Hence, this is an instance of Evan Tanner having a KO loss, not a KO win.\n\n2. **Row Index 20**: This row shows a fight against \"yuki kondo,\" marked as a win (`\"win\"` in the `\"record\"` column), with the method being `\"submission (cobra choke)\"`. This does not involve a knockout and thus is irrelevant to our claim about KO wins.\n\n3. **Scanning through all rows**:\n   - We need to search for any other rows where `method` contains \"ko\" and `record` indicates a win (`\"win\"`).\n   - After checking each row, we find that no other fighters besides Evan Tanner are mentioned with an instance of KO win.\n\nThe relevant cells in the table to verify the claim are those related to knockout methods resulting in wins:\n\n- **Row Index 6**:\n  - `\"record\": \"1 - 0\"`\n  - `\"method\": \"tko (punches)\"` (This is not a KO, but relevant for understanding no other KO win exists.)\n  \n- **Row Index 16**:\n  - `\"record\": \"7 - 2\"`\n  - `\"opponent\": \"evan tanner\"`\n  - `\"method\": \"ko (slam)\"` \n\nNo row indicates any fighter besides Evan Tanner has a record of winning by knockout.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"2 of the fight be decide in round 1,\" we need to determine how many fights were decided (i.e., resulted in a win or loss) in Round 1 according to the table provided.\n\nWe will look at each row in the data section of the JSON object and focus on two columns:\n- The \"round\" column, which indicates the round in which the fight was decided.\n- The \"record\" column (e.g., \"2 - 1\"), which helps us determine if the fight had a decisive outcome (win or loss) at that particular point.\n\nA fight is considered to be decided if it results in either a win or a loss, as indicated by the change in the record. We need to count such decisions occurring specifically in Round 1.\n\nLet's go through each row and check for fights decided in Round 1:\n\n1. Row 0: Result - Loss (round 4), not round 1.\n2. Row 1: Result - Win (round 3), not round 1.\n3. Row 2: Result - Loss (round 5), not round 1.\n4. Row 3: Result - Win (round 3), not round 1.\n5. Row 4: Result - Win (round 1), decided in round 1.\n6. Row 5: Result - Loss (round 2), not round 1.\n7. Row 6: Result - Win (round 1), decided in round 1.\n8. Row 7: Result - Win (round 1), decided in round 1.\n9. Row 8: Result - Win (round 1), decided in round 1.\n10. Row 9: Result - Loss (round 2), not round 1.\n11. Row 10: Result - Win (round 5), not round 1.\n12. Row 11: Result - Loss (round 4), not round 1.\n13. Row 12: Result - Win (round 3), not round 1.\n14. Row 13: Result - Win (round 5), not round 1.\n15. Row 14: Result - Loss (round 1), decided in round 1.\n16. Row 15: Result - Win (round 4), not round 1.\n17. Row 16: Result - Win (round 1), decided in round 1.\n\nFrom the above examination, fights that were decided in Round 1 are:\n- Row 4\n- Row 6\n- Row 7\n- Row 8\n- Row 14\n- Row 16\n\nThere are 6 such instances where a fight was decided in Round 1. The claim states \"2 of the fight be decide in round 1,\" which implies there should only be 2 such fights.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false as more than 2 fights were indeed decided in round 1.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
