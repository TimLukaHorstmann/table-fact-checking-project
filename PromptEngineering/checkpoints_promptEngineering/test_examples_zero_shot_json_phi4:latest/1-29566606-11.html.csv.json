Verify the claim against this information:\n   - The claim states that \"art attack be originally broadcast on citv.\"\n   - According to the table, \"art attack\" was indeed originally broadcast on \"citv.\"\n\nSince all conditions of the claim are met by the data in the table:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"programme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original channel (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"big brother will return on september 9 , 2011\" is true or false based on the given table, we need to identify and verify the relevant data in the table:\n\n1. **Identify the Programme**: The programme mentioned in the claim is \"big brother\". We look for this entry in the \"programme\" column.\n\n2. **Find the Row with 'big brother'**:\n   - By examining the \"data\" array, we find that \"big brother\" is listed at `row_index` 1.\n\n3. **Check the Date of Return**: \n   - For \"big brother\", check the value in the \"date of return\" column to see if it matches \"9 september 2011\".\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - At `row_index` 1, the \"date of return\" is indeed \"9 september 2011\".\n   - Therefore, this claim is fully supported by the data.\n\nBased on these steps, the relevant cells are from row index 1 in both the \"programme\" and \"date of return\" columns. Thus, we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"programme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date of return\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
