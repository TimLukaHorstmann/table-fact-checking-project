This corresponds to **row index 6**.\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Music\n- For the same row (index 6), we check the \"music\" column.\n- The value in this column for \"cecilie & tobias\" is \"perhaps, perhaps, perhaps - the pussycat dolls\".\n\nThe claim mentions that the music should be by \"the pussycat doll\".
