However, given this context where we assume all data in the table is relevant to the claim, we can proceed without such verification.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each row:\n\n1. **Row Index 0 (Tokyo)**: \n   - Surface: Carpet (i)\n   - Winners: \"lindsay davenport 6 - 7 (4) , 6 - 4 , 6 - 2\"\n   - Lindsay Davenport is listed as the winner.\n\n2. **Row Index 8 (Zurich)**:\n   - Surface: Carpet (i)\n   - Winners: \"lindsay davenport 6 - 3 , 6 - 1\"\n   - Lindsay Davenport is listed again as the winner.\n\nIn both instances, Lindsay Davenport is recorded as having won a tournament.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"in the 2001 WTA Tier I series each match be play in a different month,\" we need to examine the \"week\" column of the table for distinct months. The claim suggests that no two matches should occur in the same month.\n\nHere's how we can verify this:\n\n1. Extract the month from each entry in the \"week\" column.\n2. Check if any month appears more than once.\n\nLet's go through the data:\n\n- January 29: Month is January\n- March 5: Month is March\n- March 19: Month is March\n- April 16: Month is April\n- May 7: Month is May\n- May 14: Month is May\n- August 13: Month is August\n- October 1: Month is October\n- October 15: Month is October\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that:\n- March appears twice (March 5 and March 19).\n- May appears twice (May 7 and May 14).\n- October appears twice (October 1 and October 15).\n\nSince some months appear more than once, the claim is false.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n- Row 0: \"week\" column for January\n- Row 1: \"week\" column for March\n- Row 2: \"week\" column for March\n- Row 3: \"week\" column for April\n- Row 4: \"week\" column for May\n- Row 5: \"week\" column for May\n- Row 6: \"week\" column for August\n- Row 7: \"week\" column for October\n- Row 8: \"week\" column for October\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
