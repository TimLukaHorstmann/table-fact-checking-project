This seems to be a typographical error in the claim.\n\n2. **Position**: The claim states that Jos\u00e9 Ortiz was a \"center.\" According to the table, Jos\u00e9 Ortiz's position is indeed listed as \"center.\"\n\n3. **Years for Jazz**: The claim specifies the years 1988 - 90. In the table, it shows Jos\u00e9 Ortiz played for the Utah Jazz from 1988 to 1990.\n\n4. **School/Club Team**: The claim mentions \"Oregon State Jazz club.\" The table lists \"Oregon State\" as Jos\u00e9 Ortiz's school/club team.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells in the table:\n\n- Row index 1 has the entry for Jos\u00e9 Ortiz.\n- Column \"position\" confirms he was a center.\n- Column \"years for jazz\" shows he played from 1988 to 1990.\n- Column \"school / club team\" lists Oregon State.\n\nBased on this information, all parts of the claim are supported by the table.

His school/club is not Houston.\n   - **Row 1**: Jos\u00e9 Ortiz played for the Jazz from 1988-90, and his school was Oregon State. Not relevant to Houston or 2005-06.\n   - **Row 2**: Greg Ostertag played for the Jazz during 1995-2004 and 2005-06, but his school/club is Kansas.\n   - **Row 3**: Dan O'Sullivan played for the Jazz in 1990-91, with Fordham as his school/club. Not relevant to Houston or 2005-06.\n   - **Row 4**: Andr\u00e9 Owens has \"Houston\" listed as his school/club team and was associated with the Jazz during 2005-06.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The only player who fits both criteria (having \"Houston\" as their school/club team and being associated with the Jazz in 2005-06) is Andr\u00e9 Owens.\n- Therefore, there is indeed a connection between Houston and the Jazz club during the 2005-06 school year through Andr\u00e9 Owens.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is TRUE.
