    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate if Bellevue University was indeed the first college founded in the 20th century according to the provided data.\n\n1. **Identify relevant columns**: The claim pertains to when each school was founded, so the \"founded\" column is crucial for this assessment.\n\n2. **Extract relevant data**:\n   - Bellevue University: Founded in 1966.\n   - Other universities with their founding years are:\n     - College of Saint Mary: 1923\n     - Concordia University: 1894\n     - Doane College: 1872\n     - Hastings College: 1882\n     - Midland University: 1883\n     - Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887\n     - Peru State College: 1865\n     - York College: 1890\n\n3. **Determine founding years in the 20th century**:\n   - A college founded in the 20th century would have a year between 1901 and 2000.\n   - From the data, only Bellevue University (1966) and College of Saint Mary (1923) fall within this range.\n\n4. **Compare founding years**: \n   - The College of Saint Mary was founded in 1923.\n   - Bellevue University was founded later in 1966.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the College of Saint Mary was founded earlier than Bellevue University within the 20th century, the claim that Bellevue University is the first college found in the 20th century is false.\n\n6. **Identify relevant cells for verification**:\n   - For \"bellevue university\": Row index 0, Column \"founded\".\n   - For \"college of saint mary\": Row index 1, Column \"founded\".\n\nThe final JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
