Ensure that this is the only instance of a scoreless game involving Detroit throughout the entire data set.\n\nLet's analyze each relevant row in the provided data:\n\n- **February 27, 2009**: \n  - Visitor: Los Angeles\n  - Score: 1 - 2 (Home team: Detroit)\n  - Since the home team (Detroit) scored 2 points, this is not a scoreless game for Detroit. Therefore, the claim about this being a scoreless game is incorrect.\n\n- We need to check all other games to ensure there are no other scoreless games:\n  - For each row, examine the \"score\" column where Detroit is either the home team or visitor.\n  - A scoreless game would mean that if Detroit is the home team, the first number in the \"score\" column should be 0. If Detroit is the visitor, the second number should be 0.\n\nNow, let's check each relevant row:\n\n1. **February 2**: Score: 3 - 4 (Detroit scored 3)\n2. **February 4**: Score: 4 - 5 (Detroit scored 5)\n3. **February 7**: Score: 3 - 8 (Detroit scored 8)\n4. **February 8**: Score: 3 - 0 (Detroit scored 3)\n5. **February 10**: Score: 5 - 3 (Detroit scored 5)\n6. **February 12**: Score: 2 - 4 (Detroit scored 4)\n7. **February 13**: Score: 2 - 3 (Detroit scored 2)\n8. **February 15**: Score: 6 - 5 (Detroit scored 5)\n9. **February 18**: Score: 2 - 6 (Detroit scored 6)\n10. **February 20**: Score: 2 - 5 (Detroit scored 5)\n11. **February 21**: Score: 2 - 5 (Detroit scored 2)\n12. **February 25**: Score: 1 - 4 (Detroit scored 4)\n13. **February 27**: Score: 1 - 2 (Detroit scored 2)\n14. **February 28**: Score: 0 - 8 (Detroit scored 0)\n\nFrom the analysis, we see that on February 28, Detroit was scoreless when playing against Nashville.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because:\n- The game on February 27 was not a scoreless game for Detroit.\n- There was another scoreless game on February 28.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"5 game in the 2008 - 09 season be play at home in detroit\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to analyze relevant information from the data:\n\n1. **Identify Home Games:** We need to check which games were played at home for Detroit. This can be identified by the \"home\" column having the value \"detroit\".\n\n2. **Count the Number of Home Games:** Once we identify the games that were played in Detroit, we count how many there are.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim:** The claim states that 5 games were played at home.

    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to identify whether there was a loss in a specific game during the 2008-09 season that could have been a victory for the Detroit Red Wings.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"the lost 5 game of the 2008 - 09 season be victory for the detroit red wing.\" This implies:\n1. There is a specific fifth loss in the record.\n2. That particular game could have resulted in a win instead.\n\n### Relevant Data Points:\n- We need to identify the fifth loss in the \"record\" column.\n- Verify if any of those losses were close enough (e.g., 1-goal difference) that they might have been wins.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Identify the Fifth Loss:**\n   - The record format is \"wins-losses-ties.\"\n   - Look for the fifth occurrence where the number after the dash (losses) increases.\n\n2. **Check Score Margin:**\n   - For the identified game, check if the score difference was 1-goal or less.\n   - This would suggest it could have been a win instead of a loss.\n\n### Data Analysis:\n- The record column shows the following progression:\n  - February 2: \"32 - 11 - 7\"\n  - February 4: \"33 - 11 - 7\"\n  - February 7: \"34 - 11 - 7\"\n  - February 8: \"35 - 11 - 7\"\n  - February 10: \"36 - 11 - 7\"\n  - February 13: \"37 - 12 - 7\" (First loss)\n  - February 15: \"37 - 12 - 8\" (Second loss)\n  - February 21: \"39 - 13 - 8\" (Third loss)\n  - February 28: \"41 - 14 - 8\" (Fourth loss)\n\n- The fifth loss occurs on:\n  - **February 27**: Record changes from \"40 - 13 - 8\" to \"41 - 13 - 8\".\n\n- Check the score for February 27:\n  - Score: \"1 - 2\" (Detroit lost by 1 goal).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe fifth loss was on February 27 against Los Angeles with a score of 1-2, which is within a one-goal margin.
