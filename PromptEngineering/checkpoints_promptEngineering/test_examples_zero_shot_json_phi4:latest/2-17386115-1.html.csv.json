The player named \"Ken Irvin\" should have been picked.\n  2. His pick should have occurred in the 1st round.\n\n### Relevant Information from the Table:\n\n#### Column Details:\n- **round**: Indicates the round of the draft.\n- **player**: Contains the names of the players drafted.\n- **pick**: This column is not directly relevant for checking rounds but can help verify the order if needed.\n\n#### Data Verification:\n1. We look through each row to find \"Ken Irvin\".\n2. Check the corresponding \"round\" value for that player.\n\n### Examination of Table Data:\n\n| Row Index | Round | Pick | Player      | Position          | School / Club Team |\n|-----------|-------|------|-------------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| 0         | 1     | 14   | Ruben Brown | Guard             | Pittsburgh         |\n| 1         | 2     | 45   | Todd Collins| Quarterback       | Michigan           |\n| 2         | 3     | 76   | Marlon Kerner| Defensive Back    | Ohio State         |\n| 3         | 3     | 96   | Damien Covington| Linebacker      | North Carolina State|\n| **4**     | **4** | 109  | Ken Irvin   | Defensive Back    | Memphis            |\n\n- From the data, we find that \"Ken Irvin\" is listed in row index 4.\n- The corresponding round for \"Ken Irvin\" is 4.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim states that Ken Irvin was drafted in the 1st round. However, from our examination of the table, he was actually drafted in the 4th round.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nTo verify this, the relevant cells are those corresponding to \"Ken Irvin\" and his draft \"round\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
