Therefore, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to locate and verify specific data points from the table provided in JSON format:\n\n1. **Identify the Game Against Philadelphia**:\n   - The relevant game in question must be against \"philadelphia.\"\n   - In the table data, we find this entry at row index 12 (remembering that indexing starts from zero):\n     ```json\n     [\n       30,\n       \"december 26\",\n       \"philadelphia\",\n       \"w 105 - 101 (ot)\",\n       \"j r smith (27)\",\n       \"nen\\u00ea (12)\",\n       \"chauncey billups (10)\",\n       \"pepsi center 19155\",\n       \"19 - 11\"\n     ]\n     ```\n\n2. **Verify the Location Attendance**:\n   - The relevant cell for attendance is under the column labeled \"location attendance.\"\n   - For this specific game against Philadelphia, the location attendance recorded in the table is \"pepsi center 19155.\"\n\n3. **Compare with Claimed Value**:\n   - The claim states that the location attendance during the game against Philadelphia was \"pepsi center 19175.\"\n   - Comparing this claimed value (\"19175\") to the actual value from the data (\"19155\"), we see a discrepancy.\n\n4. **Determine the Veracity of the Claim**:\n   - Since \"19155\" does not match \"19175,\" the claim is false.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the relevant cells for verification are:\n\n- Row index: 12\n- Column name: \"location attendance\"\n\nThus, the JSON response is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
