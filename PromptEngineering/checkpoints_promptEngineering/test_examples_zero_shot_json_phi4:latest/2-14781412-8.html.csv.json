    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to check if the gold medalist in equestrian events at the Asian Games has been different for each year listed, except for 1994 and 1998.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We are interested only in the \"gold\" column as it contains the names of the gold medalists.\n   - The relevant rows correspond to each year from 1982 to 2010.\n\n2. **Extract Gold Medalists:**\n   - For each row, extract the name of the gold medalist:\n     - 1982: Nadia Al-Moutawaa\n     - 1986: Takashi Tomura\n     - 1994: Konoshin Kuwahara\n     - 1998: Jin Kanno\n     - 2002: Mikaela Mar\u00e3ada Jaworski\n     - 2006: Ali Yousuf Al-Rumaihi\n     - 2010: Ramzy Al Duhami\n\n3. **Check for Duplicates:**\n   - We need to verify if there are any duplicate names in the gold medalists, except for the years 1994 and 1998.\n   - The claim allows the same gold medalist for these two specific years.\n\n4. **Analysis:**\n   - Check each year:\n     - 1982: Nadia Al-Moutawaa\n     - 1986: Takashi Tomura (Different from 1982)\n     - 1994: Konoshin Kuwahara\n     - 1998: Jin Kanno (Allowed to be the same as 1994, but it is different)\n     - 2002: Mikaela Mar\u00e3ada Jaworski (Different from all previous years)\n     - 2006: Ali Yousuf Al-Rumaihi (Different from all previous years)\n     - 2010: Ramzy Al Duhami (Different from all previous years)\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Each year has a different gold medalist, and the exception for 1994 and 1998 does not apply since they are already different.\n   - Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells are those in the \"gold\" column for each year from 1982 to 2010.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to check two main conditions:\n\n1. **South Korea is the only country to have hosted equestrian events at the Asian Games more than once.**\n2. **Seoul hosted the games twice.**\n\nLet's analyze the table based on these conditions:\n\n### Analyzing Host Locations\n\n- **1986**: Seoul\n- **1998**: Bangkok\n- **2002**: Busan\n- **2010**: Guangzhou\n\nFrom this, we see that South Korea has hosted in Seoul (1986), Busan (2002). No other country appears more than once as a host.\n\n### Checking the Specificity of Seoul\n\nSeoul is mentioned only once in 1986. Therefore, it did not host twice.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that \"South Korea be the only country to have host equestrian at the Asian Game more than 1 time,\" which is true since South Korea (Seoul and Busan) is the only country listed with multiple hosts. However, the part of the claim stating \"in Seoul 2 time\" is false because Seoul hosted only once.\n\nThus, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nTo verify this, we need to check all rows for the host locations:\n\n- **Row Index 1**: Location \"seoul\"\n- **Row Index 4**: Location \"busan\"\n\nThese are the relevant cells that confirm South Korea has hosted more than once but not Seoul specifically twice.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
