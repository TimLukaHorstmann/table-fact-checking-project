    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about Jim Obradovich in relation to the provided table, let's break down each part of the claim:\n\n1. **\"Jim Obradovich pick after round 2 but before pick 183\":**\n   - We need to find the row for \"jim obradovich\".\n   - Check if his \"round\" is greater than 2.\n   - Check if his \"pick\" number is less than 183.\n\n2. **\"play tight end position\":**\n   - Verify that Jim Obradovich's \"position\" is \"tight end\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Row for Jim Obradovich:**\n   - From the data, we locate:\n     ```json\n     [\n       7,\n       158,\n       \"jim obradovich\",\n       \"tight end\",\n       \"usc\"\n     ]\n     ```\n\n2. **Check Round and Pick Conditions:**\n   - \"round\" is 7 (greater than 2).\n   - \"pick\" is 158 (less than 183).\n\n3. **Verify Position:**\n   - The \"position\" is indeed \"tight end\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAll conditions of the claim are satisfied:\n- Jim Obradovich was picked in round 7, which is after round 2.\n- His pick number is 158, which is before pick 183.\n- He plays as a tight end.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells to verify this are:\n\n- Row index 4 (for \"jim obradovich\"):\n  - Column: \"round\"\n  - Column: \"pick\"\n  - Column: \"position\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim about Jim Obradovich, let's break down each condition in the claim and verify it against the provided table.\n\n1. **\"Jim Obradovich pick before round 2\":**  \n   - The claim states that Jim Obradovich was picked before round 2.\n   - From the table, we find Jim Obradovich is listed with a \"round\" of 7 and a \"pick\" of 158. \n   - Therefore, this part of the claim is FALSE because he was picked in round 7.\n\n2. **\"pick 183\":**  \n   - The claim states that Jim Obradovich's pick number is 183.\n   - From the table, his pick number is 158, not 183.\n   - Therefore, this part of the claim is FALSE.\n\n3. **\"play tight end position\":**  \n   - The claim states that Jim Obradovich plays in the \"tight end\" position.\n   - From the table, his position is indeed listed as \"tight end\".\n   - Therefore, this part of the claim is TRUE.\n\nSince two out of three conditions are FALSE, the overall claim is FALSE. Now, let's identify the relevant cells from the table that verify these conditions:\n\n- For checking Jim Obradovich's round and pick number:\n  - The row where \"player\" is \"jim obradovich\" (row index 3) contains the relevant information.\n  - Relevant columns are \"round\" and \"pick\".\n\n- For verifying his position:\n  - Again, using the same row (row index 3), we check the \"position\" column.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
