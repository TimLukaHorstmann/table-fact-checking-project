    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table data, we need to evaluate each part of the claim:\n\n1. **\"all games take place on 17 February 1976 or before 14 February 1976 or after\":**\n   - We should check all game dates in the \"date\" column to ensure they are either on 17 February 1976 or before 14 February 1976, or after these dates.\n\n2. **\"every game be a tie between 7 and 1\":**\n   - A \"tie\" here refers to games that ended in a draw (score of \"X - X\").\n   - We need to verify if only the games numbered from 7 down to 1 are ties, i.e., check if games numbered 1 through 6 are not ties.\n\nNow let's evaluate these claims against the data:\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n#### Date Check\nWe'll review each game's date:\n- Game \"1\": 14 February 1976 (valid)\n- Game \"2\": 14 February 1976 (valid)\n- Replay of Game \"2\": 18 February 1976 (valid)\n- Replay of Game \"2\" again: 23 February 1976 (valid)\n- Game \"3\": 14 February 1976 (valid)\n- Replay of Game \"4\": 17 February 1976 (valid)\n- Game \"5\": 14 February 1976 (valid)\n- Game \"6\": 23 February 1976 (valid)\n- Game \"7\": 14 February 1976 (valid)\n- Replay of Game \"8\": 17 February 1976 (valid)\n\nAll game dates are either on or after 14 February 1976 and on or before 23 February 1976. Hence, the date condition is satisfied.\n\n#### Tie Check\nWe'll check if games numbered 1 to 7 match the tie requirement:\n- Game \"1\": 1 - 2 (not a tie)\n- Game \"2\": 3 - 3 (tie)\n- Replay of Game \"2\": 0 - 0 (tie)\n- Replay of Game \"2\" again: 1 - 2 (not a tie)\n- Game \"3\": 3 - 0 (not a tie)\n- Replay of Game \"4\": 4 - 0 (not a tie)\n- Game \"5\": 1 - 0 (not a tie)\n- Game \"6\": 1 - 2 (not a tie)\n- Game \"7\": 2 - 3 (not a tie)\n\nGames numbered from 1 to 6 include non-ties, so the condition that only games numbered between 7 and 1 are ties is not satisfied.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim is FALSE because there are games outside the specified range that are not ties. Here's the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
