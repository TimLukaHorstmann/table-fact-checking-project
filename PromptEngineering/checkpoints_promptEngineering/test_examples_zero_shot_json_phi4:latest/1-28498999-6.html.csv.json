    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Martin Laird be not 1 of the 2 who have 24 event,\" we need to determine how many players in the table have participated in 24 events and check if Martin Laird is one of them.\n\nFirst, let's identify which rows contain the relevant information:\n\n1. **Check for Players with 24 Events:**\n   - We will look at the \"events\" column to find all entries that equal 24.\n   - Relevant rows from the data:\n     - Row index 0: Matt Kuchar has 24 events.\n     - Row index 2: Charlie Hoffman has 22 events (not relevant).\n     - Row index 8: Martin Laird has 24 events.\n\n2. **Count of Players with 24 Events:**\n   - From the above, we find that Matt Kuchar and Martin Laird are the only players with 24 events.\n\n3. **Verification Against the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Martin Laird is \"not 1 of the 2\" who have 24 events.\n   - Since Martin Laird is indeed one of the two players with 24 events, the claim is false.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - Row index 0, column \"events\": Matt Kuchar has 24 events.\n   - Row index 8, column \"events\": Martin Laird has 24 events.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"events\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"events\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
