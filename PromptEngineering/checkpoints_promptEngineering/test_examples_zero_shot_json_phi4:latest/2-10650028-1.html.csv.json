    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify the following:\n\nThe claim states: \"Frank Conover have an overall that be 56 point lower than Michael Jackson.\"\n\nThis means we need to check:\n1. Frank Conover's overall score.\n2. Michael Jackson's overall score.\n3. Whether Frank Conover's overall is indeed 56 points less than Michael Jackson's.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Identify relevant data for Frank Conover:**\n   - Locate the row where the player is \"Frank Conover.\"\n   - Extract the \"overall\" value from this row.\n\n2. **Identify relevant data for Michael Jackson:**\n   - Locate the row where the player is \"Michael Jackson.\"\n   - Extract the \"overall\" value from this row.\n\n3. **Calculate and compare:**\n   - Subtract Frank Conover's overall score from Michael Jackson's overall score.\n   - Check if the difference is 56 points.\n\n**Step-by-step verification:**\n\n- From the table:\n  - Frank Conover is in row index 5 with an \"overall\" value of 197.\n  - Michael Jackson is in row index 4 with an \"overall\" value of 141.\n\n- Calculate the difference:\n  - Difference = Michael Jackson's overall (141) - Frank Conover's overall (197)\n  - Difference = 141 - 197 = -56\n\nThe calculation shows that Frank Conover's score is actually 56 points higher than Michael Jackson's, not lower.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant cells for verification:**\n- Frank Conover's \"overall\" value at row index 5.\n- Michael Jackson's \"overall\" value at row index 4.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
