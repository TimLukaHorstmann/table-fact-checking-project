    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to check if the model \"300sel\" has three different engines according to the table provided in JSON format.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - The columns relevant for this task are \"model\" and \"engine\". We will examine these two columns across all rows of data.\n\n2. **Filter Data by Model Name:**\n   - We need to find all entries where the model is exactly \"300sel\".\n\n3. **Extract Unique Engines for the Model:**\n   - For each entry with the model \"300sel\", we'll record its engine type.\n   - We then determine how many unique engines are associated with this specific model.\n\n4. **Verification Steps:**\n\n   - Look at each row to check if the model is \"300sel\":\n     - Row 0: Model = \"300sel\", Engine = \"3.0l m189 i6\"\n     - Row 1: Model = \"300sel\", Engine = \"2.8l m130 i6\"\n     - Row 2: Model = \"300sel 6.3\", Engine = \"6.3l m100 v8\" (This is not exactly \"300sel\")\n     - Row 3: Model = \"300sel 3.5\", Engine = \"3.5l m116 v8\" (This is not exactly \"300sel\")\n     - Row 4: Model = \"300sel 4.5\", Engine = \"4.5l m117 v8\" (This is not exactly \"300sel\")\n\n   - From the above, only rows 0 and 1 have the model \"300sel\".\n\n5. **Count Unique Engines:**\n   - For \"300sel\":\n     - Row 0: Engine = \"3.0l m189 i6\"\n     - Row 1: Engine = \"2.8l m130 i6\"\n\n   - There are only two unique engines associated with the model \"300sel\": \"3.0l m189 i6\" and \"2.8l m130 i6\".\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that \"300sel be the only model with 3 different engine\". However, there are only two distinct engines for the \"300sel\" model.\n   - Thus, the claim is false.\n\n7. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - Row 0: (\"model\", \"engine\")\n   - Row 1: (\"model\", \"engine\")\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the JSON response will be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"model\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"engine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"model\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"engine\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"300sel 4.5 be not the only model with the 4.5l m117 v8 engine\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table and identify if there are any other models besides the \"300sel 4.5\" that have a \"4.5l m117 v8\" engine.\n\n### Analysis of the Table:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column:** The claim pertains to the \"engine\" column, as it specifies an engine type: \"4.5l m117 v8\".\n\n2. **Check each row for the specified engine type:**\n\n   - Row 0 (\"300sel\", \"w109.015\", etc., \"3.0l m189 i6\"): The engine is \"3.0l m189 i6\". This does not match.\n   \n   - Row 1 (\"300sel\", \"w109.016\", etc., \"2.8l m130 i6\"): The engine is \"2.8l m130 i6\". This does not match.\n   \n   - Row 2 (\"300sel 6.3\", \"w109.018\", etc., \"6.3l m100 v8\"): The engine is \"6.3l m100 v8\". This does not match.\n   \n   - Row 3 (\"300sel 3.5\", \"w109.056\", etc., \"3.5l m116 v8\"): The engine is \"3.5l m116 v8\". This does not match.\n   \n   - Row 4 (\"300sel 4.5\", \"w109.057\", etc., \"4.5l m117 v8\"): The engine is \"4.5l m117 v8\". This matches the specified engine type.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** Only the row corresponding to the model \"300sel 4.5\" has the engine \"4.5l m117 v8\". There are no other models with this engine type in the table.\n\n### Verification of the Claim:\n\nThe claim states that the \"300sel 4.5\" is not the only model with the \"4.5l m117 v8\" engine. Since our analysis shows that it is indeed the only model with this engine, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cell for verification is in row index 4 (corresponding to \"300sel 4.5\") and column name \"engine\", as this is where the specified engine type is found.\n  \n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"engine\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
