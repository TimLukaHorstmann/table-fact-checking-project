    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to check if Lukas Smital was the man of the match against Slough Jets on the 2nd. Let's examine the relevant parts of the table:\n\n1. **Identify matches against Slough Jets:**\n   - The first entry in the data shows a match on \"1st\" against Slough Jets with Lukas Smital as the man of the match.\n   - The second entry shows another match against Slough Jets on \"2nd\", where Paul Dixon was the man of the match.\n\n2. **Check the specific match on the 2nd:**\n   - We need to focus on the row where the date is \"2nd\" and the opponent is \"Slough Jets\".\n   - In this row, the \"man of the match\" is listed as Paul Dixon, not Lukas Smital.\n\nGiven this information, the claim that Lukas Smital was the man of the match against Slough Jets on the 2nd is false. The relevant cells to verify this are:\n\n- Row index 1 for the date and opponent columns.\n- Row index 1 for the \"man of the match\" column.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"man of the match\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
