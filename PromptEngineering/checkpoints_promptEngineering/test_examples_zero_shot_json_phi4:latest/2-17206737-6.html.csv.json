    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"over 40 points be score for at least 5 game,\" we need to evaluate the data in the provided table with respect to the \"points\" column. The claim suggests checking if there are at least five instances where more than 40 points have been scored by the Montreal Canadiens.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: We focus on the \"points\" column, as it directly relates to the total score or points accumulated by the team after each game.\n\n2. **Evaluate Each Entry in the Points Column**:\n   - December 2: 32 points\n   - December 4: 34 points\n   - December 6: 35 points\n   - December 9: 37 points\n   - December 11: 37 points\n   - December 13: 37 points\n   - December 16: 37 points\n   - December 18: 39 points\n   - December 20: 41 points\n   - December 21: 42 points\n   - December 27: 44 points\n   - December 29: 46 points\n   - December 30: 48 points\n\n3. **Count Instances Over 40 Points**:\n   - The entries where the points are over 40 are:\n     - December 20: 41 points\n     - December 21: 42 points\n     - December 27: 44 points\n     - December 29: 46 points\n     - December 30: 48 points\n\n4. **Determine if There Are At Least Five Such Instances**:\n   - We have exactly five entries where the points exceed 40.\n\nSince there are at least five games where more than 40 points were scored, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells**: \n   - The relevant cells correspond to the rows where points exceeded 40: December 20, December 21, December 27, December 29, and December 30.\n   - These are rows with indices 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 in a zero-indexed system.\n\nThus, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.
