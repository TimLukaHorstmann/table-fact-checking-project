    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the number in season for 4300062 be 19\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data from the table.\n\n1. Identify the production code in question: `4300062`.\n2. Locate the row in which this production code appears.\n3. Check the corresponding value in the \"no in season\" column for that row.\n\nLet's go through these steps using the provided data:\n\n- The production codes are listed under the \"production code\" column, and we need to find `4300062`.\n- By examining the table, we find:\n  - Row with index 18 (Python-style indexing starting from 0) has the production code `4300062`.\n\nNext, verify the value in the \"no in season\" column for this row:\n\n- In row 18, under the \"no in season\" column, the value is `19`.\n\nThis matches the claim that the number in season for production code `4300062` is `19`. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n\nNow, we can construct the JSON response with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"production code\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
