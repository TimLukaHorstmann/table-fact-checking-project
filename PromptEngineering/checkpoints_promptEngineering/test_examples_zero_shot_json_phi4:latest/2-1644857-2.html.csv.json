    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two conditions using the data provided in the table:\n\n1. **Scotland must have stolen ends less than 9:**\n   - Locate the row for \"scotland\" and check the value under the \"stolen ends\" column.\n\n2. **Craig Brown is listed as the skip for the United States:**\n   - Locate the row for \"united states\" and verify that the \"skip\" column lists \"craig brown\".\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Verify Scotland's Stolen Ends\n- Find the row where the country is \"scotland\".\n- According to the table, the data for \"scotland\" is:\n  - Skip: David Murdoch\n  - Ends won: 46\n  - Ends lost: 38\n  - Blank ends: 20\n  - Stolen ends: 10\n  - Shot %: 85\n\nThe value under \"stolen ends\" for Scotland is 10, which does not satisfy the condition of being less than 9.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Craig Brown as Skip for United States\n- Find the row where the country is \"united states\".\n- According to the table, the data for \"united states\" is:\n  - Skip: Craig Brown\n  - Ends won: 40\n  - Ends lost: 44\n  - Blank ends: 13\n  - Stolen ends: 6\n  - Shot %: 81\n\nThe value under \"skip\" for the United States is indeed \"craig brown\", which satisfies this condition.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The first condition (Scotland having stolen ends less than 9) is not satisfied.\n- The second condition (Craig Brown as skip for the United States) is satisfied.\n\nSince both conditions must be true for the claim to be fully supported, and one of them is false, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For Scotland's \"stolen ends\": Row index 1, Column name \"stolen ends\"\n- For United States' \"skip\": Row index 6, Column name \"skip\"\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"stolen ends\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"skip\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
