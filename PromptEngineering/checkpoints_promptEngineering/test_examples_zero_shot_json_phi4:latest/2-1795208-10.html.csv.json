    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data in the table for entries after the year 2009 concerning the \"Paul Hunter Classic\" event and identify if \"Jimmy White\" appears as an opponent.\n\nThe claim states: \"jimmy white be listed as the opponent in the final after 2009 at the paul hunter classic.\" This means we are looking for any entry where:\n- The \"year\" is greater than 2009.\n- The \"championship\" is \"paul hunter classic\".\n- The \"opponent in the final\" is \"jimmy white\".\n\nLet's evaluate each row of data to see if it meets these criteria:\n\n1. Row Index 0: \n   - Year: 2008\n   - Championship: world series - berlin event\n   - Opponent in the final: graeme dott\n   This does not match our criteria (year > 2009 and championship = paul hunter classic).\n\n2. Row Index 1:\n   - Year: 2008\n   - Championship: paul hunter classic\n   - Opponent in the final: mark selby\n   Although this matches the \"paul hunter classic\" championship, it does not meet the year criterion (year > 2009).\n\n3. Row Index 2:\n   - Year: 2009\n   - Championship: world series - grand final\n   - Opponent in the final: john higgins\n   This entry doesn't match our criteria as it's neither \"paul hunter classic\" nor is the year greater than 2009.\n\n4. Row Index 3:\n   - Year: 2009\n   - Championship: world series - champion of champions challenge\n   - Opponent in the final: jimmy white\n   Although this matches the opponent, it doesn't meet either the championship or year criterion (championship = paul hunter classic and year > 2009).\n\n5. Row Index 4:\n   - Year: 2009\n   - Championship: paul hunter classic\n   - Opponent in the final: jimmy white\n   This row matches \"paul hunter classic\" and \"jimmy white\", but not the year criterion (year > 2009).\n\nAfter examining all rows, there are no entries that match all three conditions of being after the year 2009, related to \"Paul Hunter Classic,\" and having \"Jimmy White\" as an opponent.
