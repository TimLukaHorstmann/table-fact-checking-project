    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to verify two specific conditions:\n\n1. The \"preliminaries\" score for North Carolina.\n2. The \"evening gown\" score for North Carolina.\n\nThe claim states that North Carolina has a preliminaries score of 8.068 and an evening gown score of 8.472. We will locate the row corresponding to North Carolina in the table and check these two columns:\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify the Row for North Carolina:**\n   - From the data, we find that North Carolina is listed as:\n     ```json\n     [\n       \"north carolina\",\n       8.068,\n       8.511,\n       8.155,\n       8.472,\n       8.379\n     ]\n     ```\n   - This corresponds to row index 7 in the table.\n\n2. **Verify the Preliminaries Score:**\n   - For North Carolina (row index 7), the \"preliminaries\" score is 8.068.\n   - The claim states this value as 8.068, which matches exactly.\n\n3. **Verify the Evening Gown Score:**\n   - For North Carolina (row index 7), the \"evening gown\" score is 8.472.\n   - The claim states this value as 8.472, which also matches exactly.\n\nSince both conditions in the claim are satisfied by the data in the table, the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row index for North Carolina: 7\n- Column names to check: \"preliminaries\" and \"evening gown\"\n\nThus, the JSON object representing the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"preliminaries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"evening gown\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
