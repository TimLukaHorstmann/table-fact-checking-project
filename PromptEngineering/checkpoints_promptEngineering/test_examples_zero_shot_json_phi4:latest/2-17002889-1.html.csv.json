    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to compare the sail area of model \"6\" and model \"580\" from the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-step Evaluation:\n\n1. **Identify the Row for Model \"6\":**\n   - Locate the row where the \"model\" column contains \"6\". \n   - This is found in row index 19 with the following details:\n     - Model: \"6.0\"\n     - Sail Area: \"24.5 m square\"\n\n2. **Identify the Row for Model \"580\":**\n   - Locate the row where the \"model\" column contains \"580\".\n   - This is found in row index 17 with the following details:\n     - Model: \"580\"\n     - Sail Area: \"22.1 m square\"\n\n3. **Compare the Sail Areas:**\n   - Model \"6\" has a sail area of \"24.5 m square.\"\n   - Model \"580\" has a sail area of \"22.1 m square.\"\n\n4. **Determine if Sail Areas are Equal:**\n   - Since \"24.5 m square\" is not equal to \"22.1 m square,\" the claim that model \"6\" and model \"580\" have the same sail area is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n  - Row index 19, Column name \"sail area\" (for model \"6\")\n  - Row index 17, Column name \"sail area\" (for model \"580\")\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"sail area\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"sail area\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
