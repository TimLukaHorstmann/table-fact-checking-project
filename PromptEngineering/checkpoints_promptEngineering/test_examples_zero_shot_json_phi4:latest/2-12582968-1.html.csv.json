    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"luk\u00e1\u0161 melich never throw for greater than 78 m\" is true or false, we need to check the relevant data in the table under the \"notes\" column, which contains the throwing distances.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The \"notes\" column is relevant because it records the throwing distances.\n2. **Check Each Entry**: Examine each entry in the \"notes\" column to see if any recorded distance exceeds 78 meters.\n\nLet's go through the data row by row:\n\n- **Row 0 (1998)**: Distance = 61.51 m\n- **Row 1 (1999)**: Distance = 64.20 m\n- **Row 2 (2001)**: Distance = 66.41 m\n- **Row 3 (2003)**: Distance = 71.26 m\n- **Row 4 (2005)**: Distance = 74.53 m\n- **Row 5 (2006)**: Distance = 73.77 m\n- **Row 6 (2008)**: Distance = 70.56 m\n- **Row 7 (2009)**: Distance = 74.47 m\n- **Row 8 (2012)**: Distance = 77.17 m\n- **Row 9 (2013)**: Distance = 79.36 m\n\nUpon examining the distances, we find that in Row 9 (year 2013), the distance is 79.36 meters, which is greater than 78 meters.\n\nSince there is an entry where the throwing distance exceeds 78 meters, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cell for verification:\n- Row 9, \"notes\" column\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"notes\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
