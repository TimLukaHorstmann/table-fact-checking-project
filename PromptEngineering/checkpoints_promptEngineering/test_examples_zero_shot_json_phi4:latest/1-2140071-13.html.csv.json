    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"katie kansa coach 1 episode\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to examine relevant data points in the table.\n\n### Breakdown of the Claim:\n\n- **Coach Name:** The claim mentions \"Katie Kansa.\" We'll look for this name in the \"coach\" column.\n- **Number of Episodes Coached:** The claim states that this coach has coached 1 episode. This means we need to count how many times Katie Kansa appears in the \"coach\" column.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - We'll focus on the \"coach\" column, as it contains information about who coached each episode.\n\n2. **Search for \"Katie Kansa\":**\n   - Scan through the entries in the \"coach\" column to find occurrences of \"Katie Kansa.\"\n\n3. **Count Occurrences:**\n   - Count how many times \"Katie Kansa\" appears as a coach.\n\n4. **Verify Against Claim:**\n   - Check if the count matches 1, as claimed.\n\n### Examination of the Table:\n\n- **Row 11:** The entry for episode 11 lists \"coach\": \"katie kansas\". This matches \"katie kansa\" (considering case-insensitive match).\n- There are no other entries with a coach name that matches \"Katie Kansa.\"\n\nBased on this examination, Katie Kansa appears as the coach in exactly one episode.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the answer to the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON object with relevant details:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"coach\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n- **Row Index 10:** This corresponds to episode 11 in the table, where Katie Kansas is listed as the coach. This entry supports the claim that she coached exactly one episode.",

    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim \"rita is made into an actress be the title of episode 5,\" we need to examine two specific conditions from the table provided:\n\n1. **The character in episode 5**: We must verify that the character mentioned for episode 5 is indeed Rita.\n2. **The episode summary for episode 5**: We need to check if the episode summary states \"rita is made into an actress.\"\n\nLet's break down these steps based on the table:\n\n- First, identify which row corresponds to episode 5:\n  - The data shows that each sub-array in the \"data\" list represents a different episode. Specifically, the fifth element in this list (index 4 when zero-indexed) corresponds to episode 5.\n  \n- Verify the character for episode 5:\n  - From the table, at `row_index = 4` (\"episode\": 5), we find that \"rita is made into an actress\" under the column \"episode summary,\" confirming that Rita is indeed the character.\n\n- Confirm the episode title or summary aligns with the claim:\n  - At `row_index = 4`, the \"episode summary\" also matches exactly with \"rita is made into an actress.\"\n\nThus, both conditions required by the claim are satisfied: the character for episode 5 is Rita, and the episode summary states that she is made into an actress. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant cells to verify the claim are from `row_index = 4` in the columns \"episode\" (to confirm it's episode 5) and \"episode summary\" (to check the description).\n\nHere is the JSON object reflecting these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"episode summary\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
