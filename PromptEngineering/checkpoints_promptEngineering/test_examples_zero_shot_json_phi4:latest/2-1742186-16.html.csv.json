The \"Western Toros\" entry cannot be verified due to an unknown year but does not affect the validity regarding other teams.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim \"none of the Australian team be found in the same year\" is supported by the data because there are no duplicate founding years among those listed, hence:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
