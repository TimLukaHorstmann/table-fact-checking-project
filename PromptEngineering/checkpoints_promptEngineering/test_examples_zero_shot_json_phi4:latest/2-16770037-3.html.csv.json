The claim states: \"when points against be 213 then the try diff be -4\".\n\n2. We must identify if there's a row where the \"points against\" value is 213.\n3. Then, we need to verify if the corresponding \"try diff\" for that row equals \"-4\".\n\n### Analyzing the Table:\n- The table has columns: \"team\", \"tries for\", \"tries against\", \"try diff\", \"points for\", \"points against\", and \"points diff\".\n- We are interested in the columns \"points against\" and \"try diff\".\n\n#### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **Find Row with Points Against = 213**:\n   - Check each row to find where the \"points against\" column equals 213.\n   - The third row (index 2) has \"points against\" as 213.\n\n2. **Check Try Diff for That Row**:\n   - For the third row, check the value in the \"try diff\" column.\n   - The \"try diff\" value is \"20\".\n\n3. **Compare with Claim**:\n   - The claim specifies that when points against are 213, try diff should be \"-4\".\n   - We found that for the row where points against is 213, try diff is actually \"20\", not \"-4\".\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe condition specified in the claim is not met.
