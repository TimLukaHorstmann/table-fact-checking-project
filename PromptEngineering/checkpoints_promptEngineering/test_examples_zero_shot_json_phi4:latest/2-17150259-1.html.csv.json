We must find an entry in the table where the competition type is \"friendly\".\n\n2. **Date**: The claim specifies the date as \"26 may 1999\". We need to locate this specific date within the entries identified from step 1.\n\n3. **Venue**: The claim mentions that the location is \"lugo, emilia - romagna\". This needs to match exactly with the venue listed for the entry from steps 1 and 2.\n\nLet's verify these conditions:\n\n- We need to look through each row of data and check if any have a competition type marked as \"friendly\".\n\n- Once we identify the rows that meet the first condition (competition type is \"friendly\"), we filter further by checking if the date matches \"26 may 1999\".\n\n- Finally, for those entries that match both the competition type and date conditions, we verify the venue to ensure it says \"lugo, emilia - romagna\".\n\nUpon examining the data:\n\n1. The first row with a \"friendly\" competition is:\n   - Row Index: 10 (0-based index)\n   - Date: \"26 may 1999\"\n   - Venue: \"lugo , emilia - romagna\"\n\nThis entry meets all parts of the claim. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n\nThe relevant cells that verify this are:\n- Row Index 10, Column Name \"competition\" (for \"friendly\")\n- Row Index 10, Column Name \"date\" (for \"26 may 1999\")\n- Row Index 10, Column Name \"venue\" (for \"lugo , emilia - romagna\")\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
