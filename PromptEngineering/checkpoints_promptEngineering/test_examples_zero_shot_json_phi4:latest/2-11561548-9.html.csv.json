    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two main parts:\n\n1. Whether there are exactly three emulators with a proprietary license.\n2. Of these three, whether exactly two run on Windows.\n\nLet's break down each part step-by-step using the table data provided in JSON format:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Emulators with Proprietary License\n\nWe need to check the \"license\" column for entries that are labeled as \"proprietary\". Here are the relevant rows from the table:\n\n- Row index 3: `corn` has a proprietary license.\n- Row index 10: `sixtyforce` has a proprietary license.\n- Row index 11: `ultrahle` has a proprietary license.\n\nThese three entries confirm that there are exactly three emulators with a proprietary license. \n\n### Step 2: Check Platforms for These Proprietary Emulators\n\nNext, we need to verify which platforms each of these proprietary licensed emulators support and check if two of them run on Windows:\n\n- **Corn** (Row index 3): The \"platform\" column indicates it runs on Windows.\n- **Sixtyforce** (Row index 10): The \"platform\" column indicates it runs on OS X. It does not mention Windows.\n- **Ultrahle** (Row index 11): The \"platform\" column indicates it runs on Windows and Xbox.\n\nFrom the above, we see that:\n- `corn` supports Windows.\n- `ultrahle` supports Windows and Xbox.\n- `sixtyforce` does not support Windows.\n\nThus, exactly two of these proprietary licensed emulators (`corn` and `ultrahle`) run on Windows.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are satisfied:\n1. There are exactly three emulators with a proprietary license: `corn`, `sixtyforce`, and `ultrahle`.\n2. Exactly two of these (specifically `corn` and `ultrahle`) support running on Windows.\n\nThus, the claim is **TRUE**.\n\nHere's the JSON representation of the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"platform\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"only 3 emulator run on both window and xbox, corn, daedalusx64, and mupen64,\" we need to verify two main parts of this statement:\n\n1. **Identify emulators that run on both Windows and Xbox:**\n   - We will check the \"platform\" column for entries containing both \"windows\" and \"xbox\".\n\n2. **Check if the claim about these three specific emulators is correct:**\n   - Ensure only the mentioned emulators (\"corn\", \"daedalusx64\", and \"mupen64\") are included in those that run on both Windows and Xbox.\n\n**Step-by-step verification:**\n\n1. **Identify all emulators running on both Windows and Xbox:**\n   - **\"1964\"**: Platform includes \"windows, xbox\".\n   - **\"project64\"**: Platform includes \"windows, xbox\".\n   - **\"ultrahle\"**: Platform includes \"windows, xbox\".\n\n2. **Check if the claim about specific emulators is correct:**\n   - The claim states only \"corn\", \"daedalusx64\", and \"mupen64\" run on both Windows and Xbox.\n   - From our findings:\n     - **\"corn\"**: Platform includes \"windows\" but not \"xbox\".\n     - **\"daedalusx64\"**: Platform includes \"windows\" but not \"xbox\".\n     - **\"mupen64\"**: Platform includes \"windows, xbox\".\n\n3. **Evaluate the claim:**\n   - The emulators that actually run on both Windows and Xbox are \"1964\", \"project64\", and \"ultrahle\".\n   - Only one of the claimed emulators (\"mupen64\") matches this criterion.\n   - Therefore, the statement is incorrect as there are three emulators (not only three), and they are not the ones listed in the claim.\n\n**Relevant cells for verification:**\n\n- For \"1964\": Platform column indicates it runs on both Windows and Xbox.\n- For \"project64\": Platform column indicates it runs on both Windows and Xbox.\n- For \"ultrahle\": Platform column indicates it runs on both Windows and Xbox.\n- For \"corn\": Platform column indicates it does not run on Xbox.\n- For \"daedalusx64\": Platform column indicates it does not run on Xbox.\n- For \"mupen64\": Platform column confirms it runs on both Windows and Xbox.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"mupen64plus, android edition (ae) be the only emulator that run on android and javascript,\" we need to analyze the provided table based on two conditions:\n\n1. The emulator must support Android.\n2. The emulator must support JavaScript.\n\nLet's go through each row in the data section of the table:\n\n- **Row 0 (\"1964\")**: Platform includes Windows, Xbox (not Android or JavaScript).\n- **Row 1 (\"1964js\")**: Platform includes JavaScript (but not Android).\n- **Row 2 (\"cen64\")**: Platform includes Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux (not Android or JavaScript).\n- **Row 3 (\"corn\")**: Platform includes Windows (not Android or JavaScript).\n- **Row 4 (\"daedalusx64\")**: Platform includes Windows, PSP (not Android or JavaScript).\n- **Row 5 (\"mupen64\")**: Platform includes Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, QNX BeOS (not Android or JavaScript).\n- **Row 6 (\"mupen64plus\")**: Platform includes Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux, FreeBSD (not Android or JavaScript).\n- **Row 7 (\"mupen64plus, android edition (ae)\")**: Platform includes Android. This is the only row that supports Android.\n- **Row 8 (\"n64js\")**: Platform includes JavaScript (but not Android).\n- **Row 9 (\"project64\")**: Platform includes Windows, Xbox (not Android or JavaScript).\n- **Row 10 (\"sixtyforce\")**: Platform includes OS X (not Android or JavaScript).\n- **Row 11 (\"ultrahle\")**: Platform includes Windows, Xbox (not Android or JavaScript).\n\nFrom this analysis:\n- \"mupen64plus, android edition (ae)\" is the only emulator that supports Android.\n- No emulators support both Android and JavaScript.\n\nSince no emulator meets both conditions of running on Android and JavaScript, the claim is FALSE.
