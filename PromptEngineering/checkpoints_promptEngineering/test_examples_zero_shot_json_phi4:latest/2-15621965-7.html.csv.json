We'll check the \"years in orlando\" column for Pat Garrity.\n\n2. **Check if 10 Years is the Longest Span**: We need to ensure that no other player has a longer span than Pat Garrity's 10 years. This involves comparing all the spans listed in the \"years in orlando\" column.\n\nLet's evaluate:\n\n- **Pat Garrity**: The entry shows \"1999 - 2008\", which is indeed a span of 10 years (inclusive).\n\nNow, let's check other players to see if anyone has been with Orlando Magic for more than 10 years:\n\n- **Reece Gaines**: \"2003 - 2004\" (2 years)\n- **Kiwane Garris**: \"1999 - 2000\" (2 years)\n- **Chris Gatling**: \"1999 - 2000\" (2 years)\n- **Gordan Giricek**: \"2003 - 2004\" (2 years)\n- **Drew Gooden**: \"2003 - 2004\" (2 years)\n- **Marcin Gortat**: \"2007 - 2010\" (4 years)\n- **Horace Grant**: \"1994 - 1999\" (6 years) and \"2001 - 2003\" (3 years, but these are separate stints)\n- **Litterial Green**: \"1992 - 1994\" (3 years)\n- **Sidney Green**: \"1989 - 1990\" (2 years)\n\nNo other player has been with Orlando Magic for more than 10 years.
