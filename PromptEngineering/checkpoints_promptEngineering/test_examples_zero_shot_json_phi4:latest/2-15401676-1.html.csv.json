    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"mina gerais play 15 and lost 9,\" we need to verify two specific conditions from the provided table:\n\n1. The number of games played by \"minas gerais\" should be 15.\n2. The number of games lost by \"minas gerais\" should be 9.\n\nThe table is structured with columns: `position`, `team`, `points`, `played`, `drawn`, `lost`, `against`, and `difference`. We are specifically interested in the `played` and `lost` columns for the team \"minas gerais.\"\n\nSteps to verify:\n\n1. **Identify the row containing \"minas gerais\":**\n   - By scanning through the data, we find that \"minas gerais\" is listed at position 8 (index 7 in zero-based indexing).\n\n2. **Check the `played` column for \"minas gerais\":**\n   - In row index 7, under the `played` column, the value is 15.\n\n3. **Check the `lost` column for \"minas gerais\":**\n   - In row index 7, under the `lost` column, the value is 9.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied: \"minas gerais\" played 15 games and lost 9.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row index 7, Column name `played`\n- Row index 7, Column name `lost`\n\nThe JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"zero be the total number play with a difference of 21 and less than 32 against,\" we need to analyze each row in the provided table to check if there are any teams meeting both conditions: \n\n1. A goal difference (\"difference\") between 21 and 32 (inclusive).\n2. Goals scored against them (\"against\") being less than 32.\n\nLet's break down these steps:\n\n- **Row by Row Analysis**:\n  - For each row, we will check the values in the \"difference\" column to see if they fall within the range of 21 to 32.\n  - If the difference meets this condition, we further check the value in the \"against\" column to see if it is less than 32.\n\n- **Relevant Columns**:\n  - The relevant columns for this verification are \"difference\" and \"against\".\n\nNow let's go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: \n   - Difference: 43\n   - Against: 19\n   - The difference (43) is not between 21 and 32.\n\n2. **Row 1**:\n   - Difference: 38\n   - Against: 21\n   - The difference (38) is not between 21 and 32.\n\n3. **Row 2**:\n   - Difference: 35\n   - Against: 16\n   - The difference (35) is not between 21 and 32.\n\n4. **Row 3**:\n   - Difference: 22\n   - Against: 34\n   - The difference (22) is within the range, but against (34) is not less than 32.\n\n5. **Row 4**:\n   - Difference: 6\n   - Against: 44\n   - The difference (6) is not between 21 and 32.\n\n6. **Row 5**:\n   - Difference: -6\n   - Against: 43\n   - The difference (-6) is not between 21 and 32.\n\n7. **Row 6**:\n   - Difference: -18\n   - Against: 44\n   - The difference (-18) is not between 21 and 32.\n\n8. **Row 7**:\n   - Difference: -31\n   - Against: 49\n   - The difference (-31) is not between 21 and 32.\n\n9. **Row 8**:\n   - Difference: -30\n   - Against: 57\n   - The difference (-30) is not between 21 and 32.\n\n10. **Row 9**:\n    - Difference: -46\n    - Against: 57\n    - The difference (-46) is not between 21 and 32.\n\n- After checking all the rows, none of them satisfy both conditions (difference between 21 and 32, and against less than 32). Therefore, there are zero teams that meet these criteria.\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification are in column \"difference\" and \"against\", specifically row 3 since it almost met one condition:\n\n- Row 3:\n  - Difference: 22 (relevant because it is within the specified range)\n  - Against: 34 (relevant to check against the second condition)\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE as there are zero teams that satisfy both conditions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
