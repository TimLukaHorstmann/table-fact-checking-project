The relevant data columns are \"season\", \"score\", and any information needed to determine which year and teams were involved.\n\n1. **Extract Relevant Games:**\n   - We need only the rows where the season is 2008, as specified by the claim:\n     - Row indices with season 2008 are 12 through 17.\n   \n2. **Calculate Combined Points (Goals) for Each Game in 2008:**\n   - For each game involving Krung Thai Bank, sum the goals scored by both teams from the \"score\" column.\n\n3. **Compute Scores for Krung Thai Bank's Matches in 2008:**\n\n   - **Row 12:** \n     - Score: \"1 - 9\", Total = 1 + 9 = 10\n   - **Row 13:** \n     - Score: \"4 - 2\", Total = 4 + 2 = 6\n   - **Row 14:** \n     - Score: \"9 - 1\", Total = 9 + 1 = 10\n   - **Row 15:** \n     - Score: \"2 - 2\", Total = 2 + 2 = 4 (Involves Nam Dinh FC, not directly Krung Thai Bank)\n   - **Row 16:** \n     - Score: \"8 - 1\", Total = 8 + 1 = 9\n   - **Row 17:** \n     - Score: \"5 - 3\", Total = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n4. **Analyze the Scores:**\n   - Highest score is 10 (Rows 12 and 14).\n   - Second highest score is 9 (Row 16).\n\n5. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - The claim mentions that the second highest combined points are 10, for two different games.\n   - In 2008, there are indeed two games with a total of 10 goals each (Rows 12 and 14), but the second-highest score is actually 9.\n\nTherefore, the claim is **FALSE** as the second highest number of combined points in 2008 was not 10, but 9.\n\n6. **List Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells include those from rows 12 to 17 for the columns \"season\" and \"score\".\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

This indicates one game was played in Indonesia.\n\n2. **Identifying Games Played in China:**\n   - Similarly, we need to check the \"venue\" column for any entries that mention a location in China.\n   - According to the table:\n     - Row 5: The venue is \"dalian people's stadium, china pr\".\n     - Row 11: The venue is \"beijing fengtai stadium, china pr\".\n   - This indicates two games were played in China.\n\n3. **Comparing Counts:**\n   - Games played in Indonesia: 1\n   - Games played in China: 2\n   - According to the claim, there should be 2 fewer games in China than in Indonesia.\n   - However, we have 2 games in China and only 1 game in Indonesia.
