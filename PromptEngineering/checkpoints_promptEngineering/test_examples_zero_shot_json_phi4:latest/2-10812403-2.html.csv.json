Whether Darryl Conrad is associated with a team called \"Montreal Alouettes.\"\n2. Whether Darryl Conrad attended a college named \"Manitoba.\"\n\nFirst, let's identify the relevant row in the table for Darryl Conrad. The claim mentions his name explicitly, so we look through each row to find where \"Darryl Conrad\" appears.\n\nUpon inspection of the data:\n- Row 6 has \"darryl conrad\" listed under the \"player\" column.\n  \nNext, we check the team and college associated with Darryl Conrad in this row:\n\n1. **Team**: The table shows that Darryl Conrad is associated with the \"Montreal Alouettes,\" as indicated by the entry in the \"cfl team\" column for Row 6.\n\n2. **College**: In the same row, under the \"college\" column, it lists \"manitoba.\" This matches the claim's reference to \"manitoba college.\"\n\nBoth components of the claim are supported by the table:\n- Darryl Conrad is indeed associated with the Montreal Alouettes.\n- He attended a college named Manitoba.\n\nThus, the claim \"darryl conrad go to manitoba college\" is true based on the data provided in the table.\n\nThe relevant cells from Row 6 that verify this claim are:\n- The cell under the column \"cfl team.\"\n- The cell under the column \"college.\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"cfl team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
