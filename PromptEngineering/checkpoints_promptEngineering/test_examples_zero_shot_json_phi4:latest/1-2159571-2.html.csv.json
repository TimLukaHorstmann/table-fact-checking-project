Randall (D)\" if the claim were true.\n\nNow, we will examine each row in the data section of the table for these conditions:\n\n1. **Row 0**: \n   - District: Missouri 4th\n   - Successor: William J. Randall (D)\n   - This row is not relevant because it does not pertain to Washington 3rd.\n\n2. **Row 1**:\n   - District: New York 43rd\n   - Successor: Charles Goodell (R)\n   - Again, this row is irrelevant for the same reason as above.\n\n3. **Row 2**:\n   - District: Ohio 6th\n   - Successor: Ward Miller (R)\n\n4. **Rows 3 and 4**:\n   - These rows concern Hawaii territory and statehood changes.\n   \n5. **Row 5 to Row 13**: \n   - We continue scanning through these rows, none of which list \"Washington 3rd\" as the district.\n\n6. **Row 14**:\n   - District: Washington 3rd\n   - Vacator: Russell V.

This is crucial as it should confirm or refute the claim's date of death.\n   - The claim states that George H Christopher died on March 28, 1960. If this differs from what's in the table, the claim is false.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - If the reason for change matches \"died January 23, 1959\", it contradicts the claim which suggests a death date of March 28, 1960.\n   - Thus, the claim should be evaluated as false based on this discrepancy in dates.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on our examination, the reason for change does not support the claimed death date.
