    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break it down:\n\nThe claim states: \"Sweden and Canada be the only country on the table that do not receive a medal in 2 of the category.\"\n\nThis implies:\n1. Sweden and Canada should each have exactly one '0' count across the three categories (gold, silver, bronze).\n2. No other countries should have more than one '0' count.\n\nLet's analyze each row:\n\n- **Sweden (row 5)**: \n  - Gold = 4\n  - Silver = 0\n  - Bronze = 2\n  - Sweden has one '0', satisfying the condition.\n\n- **Canada (row 13)**:\n  - Gold = 0\n  - Silver = 2\n  - Bronze = 3\n  - Canada also has one '0', satisfying the condition.\n\nNow, check all other countries:\n\n- **Soviet Union (row 1)**: \n  - Gold = 11, Silver = 9, Bronze = 9\n  - No zeros.\n\n- **East Germany (row 2)**:\n  - Gold = 9, Silver = 10, Bronze = 6\n  - No zeros.\n\n- **Switzerland (row 3)**:\n  - Gold = 5, Silver = 5, Bronze = 5\n  - No zeros.\n\n- **Finland (row 4)**:\n  - Gold = 4, Silver = 1, Bronze = 2\n  - No zeros.\n\n- **Austria (row 6)**:\n  - Gold = 3, Silver = 5, Bronze = 2\n  - No zeros.\n\n- **Netherlands (row 7)**:\n  - Gold = 3, Silver = 2, Bronze = 2\n  - No zeros.\n\n- **West Germany (row 8)**:\n  - Gold = 2, Silver = 4, Bronze = 2\n  - No zeros.\n\n- **United States (row 9)**:\n  - Gold = 2, Silver = 1, Bronze = 3\n  - No zeros.\n\n- **Italy (row 10)**:\n  - Gold = 2, Silver = 1, Bronze = 2\n  - No zeros.\n\nAll other countries have no '0' counts in any category. Therefore, Sweden and Canada are indeed the only ones with exactly one '0', meaning they do not receive a medal in one of the categories.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Sweden: Gold (row 5, column \"gold\"), Silver (row 5, column \"silver\"), Bronze (row 5, column \"bronze\")\n- Canada: Gold (row 13, column \"gold\"), Silver (row 13, column \"silver\"), Bronze (row 13, column \"bronze\")\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
