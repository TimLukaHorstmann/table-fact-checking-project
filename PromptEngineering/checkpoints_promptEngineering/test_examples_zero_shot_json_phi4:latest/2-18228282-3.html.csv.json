Identify the row containing \"Rowan Barrett\".\n2. Check the \"year born (age)\" column for this player.\n3. Confirm if it states a birth year of 1972.\n\n### Table Analysis:\n- **Relevant Data Row:**\n  - The entry for Rowan Barrett is located at `row_index` 5 in the data array:\n    ```json\n    [\n      \"rowan barrett\",\n      1.97,\n      \"f\",\n      \"november 24 , 1972 (age41)\",\n      \"chalon - sur - sa\\u00f4ne\"\n    ]\n    ```\n- **Relevant Column:**\n  - The column of interest is `\"year born (age)\"`, which provides information about the player's birth year and age.\n\n### Verification:\n- From Rowan Barrett\u2019s entry, it states \"november 24 , 1972 (age41)\", indicating he was indeed born in the year 1972.\n  \n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is supported by the table data. Therefore, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is \"TRUE\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year born (age)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
