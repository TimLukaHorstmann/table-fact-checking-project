    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"episode 798 air on november 15\" is true or false, we need to verify two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. The episode number should be 798.\n2. The original airdate for this episode should be November 15.\n\nLet's examine the relevant data in the table to find these conditions:\n\n- We are looking specifically at the row where \"episode\" is equal to 798.\n- Within that row, we need to check both the \"episode\" column and the \"original airdate\" column.\n\nFrom the given JSON data:\n```json\n[\n    [ ... ],\n    [ ... ],\n    [ ... ],\n    [ ... ],\n    [\n      798,\n      \"none\",\n      \"jeffrey goldberg , david stern\",\n      \"none\",\n      \"november 15\",\n      6146\n    ],\n    [ ... ]\n]\n```\n\nWe can observe the following:\n- The row index for episode number 798 is 4 (0-based indexing).\n- In this row, the value in the \"original airdate\" column is indeed \"November 15\".\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied: \n1. Episode number is 798.\n2. Original airdate is November 15.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data in the table.
