    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the prize for winning the national school scrabble championship doubled from 2008 to 2009,\" we need to examine the relevant data points in the table. The focus is on the \"year\" and \"winner's prize\" columns to compare the prize amounts between the years 2008 and 2009.\n\n1. **Identify the rows for the years 2008 and 2009**:\n   - For 2008, locate the row where the year column has the value `2008`.\n   - For 2009, locate the row where the year column has the value `2009`.\n\n2. **Extract \"winner's prize\" amounts for these years**:\n   - In the row corresponding to 2008, identify the value in the \"winner's prize\" column.\n   - In the row corresponding to 2009, identify the value in the \"winner's prize\" column.\n\n3. **Compare the prizes**:\n   - For 2008, the winner's prize is `us5000`.\n   - For 2009, the winner's prize is `us10000`.\n\n4. **Determine if the prize doubled**:\n   - Doubling of the prize from 2008 to 2009 would mean the amount for 2009 should be twice that of 2008.\n   - Calculation: \\(5000 \\times 2 = 10000\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The prize in 2009 is indeed `us10000`, which is exactly double the `us5000` prize from 2008.\n\nSince the condition described in the claim holds true, we conclude that the claim is TRUE.

We need to verify this by checking the \"location\" column across different rows (years).\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant column: The column \"location\" is relevant because it tells us where each event took place.\n2. Check consecutive entries in the \"location\" column starting from 2003 onwards, since the claim involves a sequence of four years:\n   - In row index 9 (year 2005), the location is \"boston , ma\".\n   - In row index 8 (year 2006), the location is \"boston , ma\".\n   - In row index 7 (year 2007), the location is \"providence , ri\". This breaks the sequence.\n   - However, checking from year 2004:\n     - In row index 10 (year 2003), the location is \"boston , ma\".\n     - In row index 9 (year 2004), the location is \"boston , ma\".\n     - In row index 8 (year 2005), the location is \"boston , ma\".\n     - In row index 7 (year 2006), the location is \"boston , ma\".\n\nBased on this, Boston, MA was indeed the location for four consecutive years from 2003 to 2006.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two conditions for both Matthew Silver and Thomas Bao:\n\n1. **Matthew Silver**:\n   - Check if he has won the championship twice between 2003 and 2013.\n\n2. **Thomas Bao**:\n   - Similarly, check if he has won the championship twice within the same period.\n\nLet's examine the data for each individual:\n\n### Matthew Silver\n- **Row 7**: In 2007, \"aune mitchell & matthew silver (ct)\" are listed as winners.\n- **Row 6**: In 2008, \"loganrosen & matthew silver (ct)\" are listed as winners.\n\nMatthew Silver appears twice in the winner list for different years: 2007 and 2008.\n\n### Thomas Bao\n- **Row 10**: In 2004, \"thomas bao & eric johnston (ca)\" are listed as winners.\n\nThomas Bao appears only once in the winner list: 2004.\n\n### Conclusion\n- Matthew Silver has won twice.\n- Thomas Bao has won only once.\n\nThe claim states that both individuals have won the championship two times, which is false because Thomas Bao only won once.\n\nHere's the relevant data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"winners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"winners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"winners\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
