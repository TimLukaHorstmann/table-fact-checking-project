    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"Pittsburgh will be the Montreal visit with more than 24 points and 14995 attendees after December 19,\" we need to break down each part of this statement:\n\n1. **\"Pittsburgh will be the Montreal visit\":** This means we are looking for a game where Pittsburgh is the home team and Montreal is the visiting team.\n\n2. **\"with more than 24 points\":** We want the record after this game to show more than 24 total points.\n\n3. **\"and 14995 attendees\":** The attendance of this game should be exactly 14995.\n\n4. **\"after December 19\":** This means any games occurring after December 19th must be considered.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- We first identify any games where Pittsburgh is the home team and Montreal is the visitor.\n  \n- Then, we check if these games occur after December 19.\n  \n- Next, verify that the attendance of such a game is exactly 14995.\n  \n- Finally, ensure that after this game, the total points exceed 24.\n\nLet's evaluate:\n\n1. **Identify Pittsburgh vs. Montreal Game:**\n   - On December 25th, there is an entry:\n     ```json\n     [\n       \"december 25\",\n       \"montreal\",\n       \"2 - 4\",\n       \"pittsburgh\",\n       7778,\n       \"11 - 19 - 5\",\n       27\n     ]\n     ```\n   - Pittsburgh is the home team, and Montreal is the visitor.\n\n2. **Date Check:**\n   - This game occurs on December 25th, which is after December 19th.\n\n3. **Attendance Check:**\n   - The attendance for this game is 7778, not 14995.\n\n4. **Points Check:**\n   - After this game, the points are recorded as 27, which is indeed more than 24.\n\nAlthough the points condition is satisfied, the attendance condition (14995 attendees) is not met since it's only 7778. Therefore, the claim is not fully supported by the data.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify these conditions from the table are:\n\n- The entry on December 25th: This involves checking the visitor, home team, date, attendance, and points.\n  \nRelevant cell indices:\n- \"date\": row index 12\n- \"visitor\": row index 12\n- \"home\": row index 12\n- \"attendance\": row index 12\n- \"points\": row index 12\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
