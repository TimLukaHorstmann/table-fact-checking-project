The relevant information includes the player's country and their placement (indicated by \"place\" such as \"t1\", \"t3\", etc.).\n\nHere is a step-by-step examination:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: We focus on all rows listed, since these represent the top finishers.\n2. **Check Player's Country**:\n   - Each row contains data under the \"country\" column.\n   - All players listed in the table are from the United States.\n\n3. **Determine Placement**:\n   - The placements are given by columns like \"t1\", \"t3\", and numbers such as \"10\".\n   - These collectively represent positions among the top 10 finishers, even though they are not sequentially numbered from 1 to 10 in this table.\n\n4. **Validate Claim**:\n   - Since every player listed is from the United States, and all rows represent a part of the top 10 placements, the claim holds true for this data set.\n\nBased on this examination, we conclude that the claim is supported by the provided information.

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim about the lowest score at the US Open in 1955 being a +3 achieved by four golfers, we need to examine the data provided in the table.\n\nThe relevant column for this verification is \"to par\" since it indicates each player's performance relative to par. We'll check if any golfer has achieved a \"+3\", and if so, whether four golfers have done so.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Scores**: Look at the \"to par\" column to find scores.\n2. **Check for +3 Score**: Verify if any score equals \"+ 3\".\n3. **Count Golfers with +3 Score**: If a \"+ 3\" score is found, count how many golfers achieved it.\n\n### Examination of the Data:\n\n- Row 0: \"to par\" = \"+ 4\"\n- Row 1: \"to par\" = \"+ 4\"\n- Row 2: \"to par\" = \"+ 5\"\n- Row 3: \"to par\" = \"+ 5\"\n- Row 4: \"to par\" = \"+ 5\"\n- Row 5: \"to par\" = \"+ 5\"\n- Row 6: \"to par\" = \"+ 8\"\n- Row 7: \"to par\" = \"+ 8\"\n- Row 8: \"to par\" = \"+ 8\"\n- Row 9: \"to par\" = \"+ 9\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nNo golfer has a \"to par\" score of \"+ 3\". Therefore, the claim that the lowest score was \"+ 3\" achieved by four golfers is false.\n\nRelevant cells are those in the \"to par\" column because this directly addresses the scores mentioned in the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
