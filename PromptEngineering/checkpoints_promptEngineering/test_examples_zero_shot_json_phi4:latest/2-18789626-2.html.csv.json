The claim asserts exclusivity for the Mavericks joining after 1970.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim:** \n   - The claim suggests that among all teams listed, only the Mavericks joined post-1970.\n   \n2. **Relevant Column:**\n   - We focus on the \"year joined\" column to check which years are mentioned for each team.\n\n3. **Examine Each Entry:**\n   - For every row in the data, we need to verify if the year mentioned is greater than 1970.\n\n4. **List of Teams Joined After 1970:**\n   - Examine each entry:\n     - Row index 12: \"mccutcheon\", \"year joined\": 1975\n     - No other entries list a \"year joined\" after 1970.\n   \n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Only the Mavericks from McCutcheon High School joined in 1975, which satisfies the condition of joining after 1970.\n\n6. **Verification:**\n   - All other teams either joined before or precisely at the year 1970.\n  \n7. **Determine Truthfulness:**\n   - Since only the Mavericks joined after 1970 and no other team did so, the claim is accurate.\n\n8. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - We list cells related to the \"year joined\" that are pertinent:\n     - The cell from row index 12 (Mavericks), as it confirms joining in 1975.\n     - Additionally, confirm there are no other rows with years greater than 1970.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Therefore, the claim of only one team joining is false for Carroll County.\n\n### Checking Clinton County\n\n- **County Column**: We look for entries where the \"county\" is \"12 clinton\".\n\n  - Row 4: \"rossville\", \"hornets\", County = \"12 clinton\"\n  - Row 8: \"clinton prairie\", \"gophers\", County = \"12 clinton\"\n\n- **Year Joined Column**: We check the \"year joined\" for each of these rows to see how many teams joined in Clinton County.\n\n  - Row 4: Year joined = \"1947\"\n  - Row 8: Year joined = \"1961\"\n\nThere are two teams from Clinton County that have joined at different times. Therefore, the claim of only one team joining is false for Clinton County.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that only one team from each county (Carroll and Clinton) joined, but we found three teams from Carroll County and two from Clinton County that have joined at different times. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells:\n\n- For Carroll County:\n  - Row 1: \"year joined\" = \"1947\"\n  - Row 2: \"year joined\" = \"1947\"\n  - Row 9: \"year joined\" = \"1961\"\n\n- For Clinton County:\n  - Row 4: \"year joined\" = \"1947\"\n  - Row 8: \"year joined\" = \"1961\"\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
