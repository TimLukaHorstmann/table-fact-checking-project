    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the game at the north shore event centre be play on december 4,\" we need to verify two specific pieces of information from the table: \n\n1. Whether there is a game scheduled on December 4.\n2. If such a game exists, whether it is played at the North Shore Events Centre.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- **Check for a game on December 4**: \n  - We look through the \"date\" column to find an entry matching \"4 december.\"\n\n- **Verify the venue for this game**:\n  - Once we identify the row with the date \"4 december,\" we need to check the \"venue\" column in that specific row to confirm it matches \"north shore events centre.\"\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the provided data:\n\n1. The table has a row where the \"date\" is \"4 december.\" This corresponds to the second entry (row index 1) in the data list.\n2. In this same row, we check the \"venue\" column and find it states \"north shore events centre.\"\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied: there is indeed a game on December 4 at the North Shore Events Centre.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells for verification are:\n\n- Row index 1 (the row corresponding to December 4).\n- Column names \"date\" and \"venue\".\n\nThe JSON output reflecting this conclusion is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
