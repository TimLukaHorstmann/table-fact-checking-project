The time should be \"1:47\".\n\nWe will look at the row corresponding to the seventh game in the data:\n\n- **Row Index**: According to zero-based indexing, the seventh game corresponds to index 6 (because we start counting from 0).\n\nNow let's verify each condition using the relevant cells:\n\n1. **Date Check**:\n   - For the seventh game, at row index 6, check the \"date\" column.\n   - The value is \"october 8\", which matches the claim.\n\n2. **Time Check**:\n   - For the seventh game, at row index 6, check the \"time\" column.\n   - The value is \"1:47\", which also matches the claim.\n\nBoth conditions specified in the claim are satisfied by the data in the table for the seventh game entry.\n\nThus, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
