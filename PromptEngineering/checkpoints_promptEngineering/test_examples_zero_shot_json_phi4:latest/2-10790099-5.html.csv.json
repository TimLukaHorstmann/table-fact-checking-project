Let's review the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The column that contains the \"home team scores\" is crucial for this task, which is \"home team score\".\n\n2. **Extract Scores**: We will extract the home team scores from each row in the data.\n\n   - Row 0: Footscray scored 13.14 (92)\n   - Row 1: Fitzroy scored 12.6 (78)\n   - Row 2: Carlton scored 13.15 (93)\n   - Row 3: North Melbourne scored 18.10 (118)\n   - Row 4: Richmond scored 13.18 (96)\n   - Row 5: South Melbourne scored 14.15 (99)\n\n3. **Convert Scores**: The scores are given in a format where the number after the parenthesis is the total score. We will use these numbers for comparison.\n\n4. **Compare Scores**:\n   - Footscray: 92\n   - Fitzroy: 78\n   - Carlton: 93\n   - North Melbourne: 118\n   - Richmond: 96\n   - South Melbourne: 99\n\n5. **Determine Highest Score**: Compare all the total scores to find the highest:\n   - The highest score is 130 by Geelong as an away team, but we are only concerned with home team scores.\n   - Among home teams, South Melbourne has the highest score of 99.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: North Melbourne's score of 118 is not the highest; South Melbourne has a higher home team score of 99.\n\nThus, the claim that \"north melbourne have the highest home team score in the list\" is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are those containing the \"home team scores\":\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate the number of crowds at the specified venues:\n\n**Claim:** \"punt road oval venue have 2000 crowd more than arden street oval\"\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows and Columns:**\n   - We need the \"crowd\" for both \"punt road oval\" and \"arden street oval\".\n   - From the table, locate the rows where these venues are mentioned:\n     - \"Punt Road Oval\" is in row index 4.\n     - \"Arden Street Oval\" is in row index 3.\n\n2. **Extract Crowd Values:**\n   - For \"punt road oval\" (row index 4):\n     - Crowd = 10,000\n   - For \"arden street oval\" (row index 3):\n     - Crowd = 12,000\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - Calculate the difference in crowd numbers:\n     - Punt Road Oval crowd = 10,000\n     - Arden Street Oval crowd = 12,000\n     - Difference = 10,000 - 12,000 = -2,000\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"punt road oval\" has 2,000 more people than \"arden street oval\".\n   - However, the calculation shows that \"arden street oval\" actually had 2,000 more people than \"punt road oval\".\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the calculated difference is not +2,000 as claimed but rather -2,000, the claim is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - Row index 3, Column \"crowd\" (Arden Street Oval)\n   - Row index 4, Column \"crowd\" (Punt Road Oval)\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the third largest crowd be on the venue of lake oval\" is true or false, we need to evaluate and compare the \"crowd\" sizes for each game in the provided data.\n\n1. **Extract Relevant Data**: We focus on the \"crowd\" column from each row since it contains information about the number of spectators.\n\n2. **Data Extraction**:\n   - Row 0: Crowd = 14,000\n   - Row 1: Crowd = 13,000\n   - Row 2: Crowd = 32,000\n   - Row 3: Crowd = 12,000\n   - Row 4: Crowd = 10,000\n   - Row 5: Crowd = 28,000\n\n3. **Ranking the Crowds**: Sort these values in descending order to identify the largest crowds:\n   - 32,000 (Row 2)\n   - 28,000 (Row 5)\n   - 14,000 (Row 0)\n   - 13,000 (Row 1)\n   - 12,000 (Row 3)\n   - 10,000 (Row 4)\n\n4. **Identify the Third Largest**: The third largest crowd is 14,000.\n\n5. **Check Corresponding Venue**:\n   - According to row data, a crowd of 14,000 corresponds to \"lake oval\" in Row 5.\n\n6. **Validate the Claim**: Since the venue with the third largest crowd (14,000) is indeed \"lake oval,\" the claim is supported by the data.\n\n7. **Determine Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells for verifying this are related to both \"crowd\" and \"venue\" in Row 5.\n\nBased on these steps, the JSON response should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
