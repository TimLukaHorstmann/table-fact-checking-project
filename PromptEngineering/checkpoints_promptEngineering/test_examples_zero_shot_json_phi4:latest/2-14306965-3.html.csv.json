    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"gold be not smaller than zero for the nation of kazakhstan (kaz) so the total be more than zero\", we need to break down the statement into two parts and verify them against the provided data.\n\n### Breakdown of the Claim:\n1. **\"gold be not smaller than zero for the nation of kazakhstan (kaz)\"**:\n   - This part requires checking the \"gold\" column value for Kazakhstan (\"kaz\").\n   \n2. **\"so the total be more than zero\"**:\n   - The implication here is that if the gold count for Kazakhstan is at least 0, then the overall total of medals must exceed 0.\n\n### Verification Process:\n\n1. **Check Gold Count for Kazakhstan:**\n   - Locate the row corresponding to \"kazakhstan (kaz)\" in the data.\n   - Check the value in the \"gold\" column for this row.\n   - According to the table:\n     ```json\n     [\n       [\"5\", \"kazakhstan (kaz)\", 0, 2, 0, 2]\n     ]\n     ```\n   - The gold count for Kazakhstan is `0`, which satisfies the condition of being not smaller than zero.\n\n2. **Check Total Medals:**\n   - Locate the row labeled as \"total\" in the data.\n   - Check the value in the \"total\" column to ensure it's greater than 0.\n   - According to the table:\n     ```json\n     [\n       [\"total\", \"total\", 14, 14, 14, 42]\n     ]\n     ```\n   - The total number of medals is `42`, which is indeed more than zero.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBoth parts of the claim are satisfied based on the data provided in the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For checking Kazakhstan's gold count: \n  - Row index: 5\n  - Column name: \"gold\"\n  \n- For verifying the total medals count:\n  - Row index: 11 (corresponds to \"total\")\n  - Column name: \"total\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
