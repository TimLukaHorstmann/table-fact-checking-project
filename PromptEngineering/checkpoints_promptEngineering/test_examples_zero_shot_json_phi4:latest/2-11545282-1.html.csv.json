However, we found a player (Louis Amundson) from the United States playing after 2000.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince there is an additional nationality (United States) contributing to Jazz players after 2000, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- John Amaechi: \"nationality\" and \"years for jazz\"\n- Rafael Ara\u00fajo: \"nationality\" and \"years for jazz\"\n- Louis Amundson: \"nationality\" and \"years for jazz\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
