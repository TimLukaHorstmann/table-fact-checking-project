    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"April 1939, Hawthorn destroyed North Melbourne, 17 to 11,\" we need to verify several components against the provided data in the table:\n\n1. **Date Verification**: The claim specifies April 1939. We need to ensure that all games listed occurred on \"29 April 1939.\" \n\n2. **Teams Involved**: Confirm that Hawthorn played against North Melbourne.\n\n3. **Match Outcome**: Verify that Hawthorn's score was indeed higher than North Melbourne's, and check the scores mentioned in the claim (17 for Hawthorn vs. 11 for North Melbourne).\n\nLet\u2019s break down each relevant condition with reference to specific cells:\n\n- **Date Verification**:\n  - The \"date\" column is the same across all rows: \"29 April 1939.\" This confirms that all matches, including the one involving Hawthorn and North Melbourne, occurred in April 1939.\n\n- **Teams Involved**:\n  - In the first row (row index 0), the \"home team\" is \"hawthorn,\" and the \"away team\" is \"north melbourne.\" This aligns with the claim's teams.\n\n- **Match Outcome**:\n  - The \"home team score\" for Hawthorn in row 0 is \"17.13 (115),\" which corresponds to a total of 115 points.\n  - The \"away team score\" for North Melbourne in row 0 is \"11.11 (77),\" corresponding to a total of 77 points.\n  - The claim states the scores were \"17 to 11.\" In Australian Rules Football, scores are given as goals and behinds, where:\n    - A goal is worth 6 points.\n    - A behind is worth 1 point.\n  - For Hawthorn: 17 goals (17 * 6 = 102) + 13 behinds (13 * 1 = 13) = 115 total points.\n  - For North Melbourne: 11 goals (11 * 6 = 66) + 11 behinds (11 * 1 = 11) = 77 total points.\n\nThe scores \"17 to 11\" in the claim match the breakdown of the scores provided in the table, confirming that Hawthorn's score was indeed higher than North Melbourne's, as claimed.\n\nBased on this analysis, all conditions of the claim are supported by the data.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down the conditions in the claim and compare them against the table:\n\n1. **Claim:** \"the highest scoring game was when Richmond played Footscray.\"\n   - To verify this, we need to calculate the total scores for each game and identify which game had the highest combined score.\n\n2. **Calculating Total Scores:**\n   - For each row in the data:\n     - Convert the home team's score from \"goals.behinds\" format to a numerical value.\n     - Convert the away team's score similarly.\n     - Sum these values for each game.\n\n3. **Game Analysis:**\n   - Row 0 (Hawthorn vs North Melbourne): \n     - Hawthorn: \\(17 \\times 6 + 13 = 115\\)\n     - North Melbourne: \\(11 \\times 6 + 11 = 77\\)\n     - Total score = 192\n   - Row 1 (Fitzroy vs St Kilda):\n     - Fitzroy: \\(14 \\times 6 + 18 = 102\\)\n     - St Kilda: \\(20 \\times 6 + 14 = 134\\)\n     - Total score = 236\n   - Row 2 (Essendon vs Melbourne):\n     - Essendon: \\(19 \\times 6 + 21 = 135\\)\n     - Melbourne: \\(21 \\times 6 + 15 = 141\\)\n     - Total score = 276\n   - **Row 3 (Richmond vs Footscray):**\n     - Richmond: \\(20 \\times 6 + 19 = 139\\)\n     - Footscray: \\(17 \\times 6 + 8 = 110\\)\n     - Total score = 249\n   - Row 4 (South Melbourne vs Collingwood):\n     - South Melbourne: \\(15 \\times 6 + 17 = 107\\)\n     - Collingwood: \\(21 \\times 6 + 20 = 146\\)\n     - Total score = 253\n   - Row 5 (Geelong vs Carlton):\n     - Geelong: \\(14 \\times 6 + 8 = 92\\)\n     - Carlton: \\(11 \\times 6 + 13 = 79\\)\n     - Total score = 171\n\n4. **Identifying the Highest Scoring Game:**\n   - The highest total score is 276 from the Essendon vs Melbourne game.\n\n5. **Claim Analysis:**\n   - The claim states that Richmond's game against Footscray was the highest scoring, but it has a total score of 249.\n   - Therefore, this part of the claim is false.\n\n6. **Additional Claim Check:** \n   - \"Richmond scored 19.21 (135)\"\n     - From Row 3, Richmond actually scored 20.19 (139), not 19.21 (135).\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is entirely false based on the analysis of both conditions.\n\n8. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - For \"highest scoring game\" and score verification:\n     - Row 2, Columns: \"home team score\", \"away team score\"\n     - Row 3, Columns: \"home team score\", \"away team score\"\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
