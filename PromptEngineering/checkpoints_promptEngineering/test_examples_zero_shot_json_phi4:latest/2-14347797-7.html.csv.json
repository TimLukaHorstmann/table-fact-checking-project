    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"February 21 have a score of 5 - 4,\" we need to examine the relevant parts of the table.\n\nThe claim contains two conditions:\n1. The date is February 21.\n2. The score for that date is 5 - 4.\n\nWe will check these conditions against the data in the table:\n\n- **Condition 1: Date is February 21**\n  - We look at the \"february\" column to find any entry with the value `21`.\n  \n- **Condition 2: Score is 5 - 4**\n  - For the row where the date matches February 21, we check if the \"score\" column has the value `5 - 4`.\n\nNow, let's examine the table data:\n\n1. The relevant entry for February 21 in the \"february\" column appears in row index 10:\n   - Row 10: `[63, 21, \"atlanta thrashers\", \"5 - 4\", \"32 - 15 - 11 - 5\", 80]`\n   \n2. In this row, the \"score\" column indeed has the value `5 - 4`.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data in row index 10.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells for verification are:\n- Row index 10, column \"february\"\n- Row index 10, column \"score\"\n\nHere's the JSON object with the result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"february\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the score be 5 - 4 on February 24\" is true or false, we must examine the relevant parts of the provided table in JSON format.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We need to find the row where the date (or month) is February 24.\n   - Check the \"score\" for that specific game date to see if it matches \"5 - 4\".\n\n2. **Examine Each Row for February 24:**\n   - Look at each row in the \"data\" list and check the value of the \"february\" column since this column seems to be representing dates within February.\n   - Specifically, find the entry where `February` is equal to `24`.\n\n3. **Check the Score:**\n   - Once the correct row for February 24 is found, examine the value in the \"score\" column to see if it matches \"5 - 4\".\n\n### Examination:\n- The relevant row from the table data is as follows:\n\n  ```json\n  [\n    64,\n    24,\n    \"chicago blackhawks\",\n    \"3 - 1\",\n    \"33 - 15 - 11 - 5\",\n    82\n  ]\n  ```\n\n- **Row Index:** `63` (as indexing starts at zero in JSON arrays)\n- **Column for Date (February):** The value is `24`, which matches our date of interest.\n- **Score Column:** The score listed is `\"3 - 1\"`, not `\"5 - 4\"`.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim that the score was \"5 - 4\" on February 24 is incorrect. The actual score recorded in the table for this date is \"3 - 1\".\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is `FALSE`.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- **Row Index:** `63`\n- **Column Name:** `\"february\"` (for confirming the date)\n- **Column Name:** `\"score\"` (to check the actual score)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 63, \"column_name\": \"february\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 63, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
