    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to check each condition against the table and identify relevant cells.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n1. **\"7 games with 4 losses\"**:\n   - We look for rows where \"games\" = 7 and \"lost\" = 4.\n2. **\"0 drawn\"**:\n   - Within those rows, we check if \"drawn\" = 0.\n3. **\"19 - 19 point differential\"**:\n   - Further, ensure the \"points difference\" is \"19 - 19\".\n4. **\"6 points\"**:\n   - Finally, verify that \"points\" = 6.\n\n### Table Examination:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - games: 7, drawn: 1, lost: 0, points difference: \"41 - 16\", points: 13\n  - Does not satisfy any condition fully.\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - games: 7, drawn: 4, lost: 0, points difference: \"30 - 21\", points: 10\n  - Does not meet the conditions of 4 losses or point differential.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - games: 7, drawn: 1, lost: 2, points difference: \"24 - 20\", points: 9\n  - Does not have 4 losses or correct point differential.\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - games: 7, drawn: 2, lost: 2, points difference: \"23 - 28\", points: 8\n  - Does not meet the conditions of 4 losses or point differential.\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - games: 7, drawn: 1, lost: 3, points difference: \"22 - 15\", points: 7\n  - Does not have 4 losses or correct point differential.\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - games: 7, drawn: 0, lost: 4, points difference: \"19 - 19\", points: 6\n  - Meets all conditions: 7 games, 4 losses, 0 drawn, \"19 - 19\" point differential, and 6 points.\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - games: 7, drawn: 0, lost: 6, points difference: \"13 - 26\", points: 2\n  - Does not have 4 losses or correct point differential.\n\n- **Row 7**:\n  - games: 7, drawn: 1, lost: 6, points difference: \"13 - 40\", points: 1\n  - Does not meet the conditions of 4 losses or point differential.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is fully supported by row 5. Therefore, the answer is TRUE. The relevant cells are those in row 5 for each condition checked.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
