The claim specifically mentions Mauricio Gugelmin, but the table does not provide any direct information about drivers. Therefore, we must assume that if a driver participated with an entrant in those years, they would be associated with all data entries for that entrant.\n\nLet's examine each row to determine which ones involve the Judd V8 engine:\n\n1. **1988**: \"leyton house march racing team\" used a \"Judd V8\".\n2. **1989**: \"leyton house racing\" used a \"Judd V8\" twice (with different chassis: \"march 881\" and \"march cg891\").\n3. **1990**: \"leyton house\" used a \"Judd V8\".\n4. **1991**: \"leyton house\" used an \"Ilmor V10\".\n5. **1992**: \"sasol jordan yamaha\" used a \"Yamaha V12\".\n\nFrom this, we can see that the Judd V8 engine was used in 1988, 1989 (twice), and 1990, totaling 4 instances.\n\nThe claim states that Mauricio Gugelmin used the Judd V8 engine in 4 out of 6 races. The table lists data for 6 entries across different years and teams. Assuming Mauricio Gugelmin participated with Leyton House or its derivatives (since the table does not specify drivers), he would have driven in these 4 instances.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data if we assume Gugelmin's association with the entrants listed. The relevant rows for this analysis are:\n\n- Row index 0: Judd V8 used\n- Row index 1: Judd V8 used\n- Row index 2: Judd V8 used\n- Row index 3: Judd V8 used\n\nThe column relevant to verifying the claim is \"engine\".\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"engine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"engine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"engine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"engine\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
