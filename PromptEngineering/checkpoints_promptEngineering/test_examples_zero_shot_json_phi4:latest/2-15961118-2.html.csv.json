    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to break it down into its components:\n\n1. **Identify teams using NSR250**: \n   - Look for entries where the \"machine\" column contains \"nsr250\".\n\n2. **Check if \"cup noodle - honda\" is the only team with NSR250**:\n   - Confirm that no other team has \"nsr250\" as their machine.\n\n3. **Verify points condition**:\n   - Ensure that \"cup noodle - honda\" has less than 8 points when using \"nsr250\".\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- In 1993, \"cup noodle - honda\" uses \"nsr250\" and earns 8 points.\n- In 1994, \"cup noodle - honda\" again uses \"nsr250\" and earns 11 points.\n\nNo other team in the data uses \"nsr250\". Thus, \"cup noodle - honda\" is indeed the only team with this machine.\n\nHowever, for the claim to be true, \"cup noodle - honda\" must have less than 8 points with \"nsr250\", but they have exactly 8 points in 1993 and more (11) in 1994. Therefore, the condition of having less than 8 points is not satisfied.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"machine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"machine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
