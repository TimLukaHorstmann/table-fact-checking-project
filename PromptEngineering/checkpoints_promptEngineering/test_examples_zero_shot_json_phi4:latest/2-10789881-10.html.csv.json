    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding the game at Brunswick Street Oval having a crowd size of 11,000 and being one of two games with such attendance, we need to analyze relevant data points in the table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. Identify the row(s) where the venue is \"Brunswick Street Oval.\"\n2. Check if the crowd for that game is indeed 11,000.\n3. Count all instances across the dataset where the crowd size is 11,000 and verify it happens exactly twice.\n\n### Relevant Data Analysis:\n\n#### Step-by-Step Verification:\n1. **Identify the venue \"Brunswick Street Oval\":**\n   - Check each row's \"venue\" column to find matches with \"Brunswick Street Oval.\"\n   - The match is found in row index 1 (0-based).\n\n2. **Check crowd size for Brunswick Street Oval:**\n   - In row index 1, under the \"crowd\" column, the value is indeed 11,000.\n\n3. **Count all instances of a crowd size of 11,000:**\n   - Row 1 has a crowd of 11,000.\n   - Check other rows for similar crowd sizes:\n     - Row 2 (\"richmond\", \"punt road oval\") also has a crowd of 11,000.\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   - There are exactly two games with a crowd size of 11,000 (rows 1 and 2).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that the game at Brunswick Street Oval is one of two games with a crowd of 11,000 is TRUE because both conditions are satisfied:\n- The game at Brunswick Street Oval indeed had a crowd of 11,000.\n- There are exactly two instances across all data entries where the crowd size was 11,000.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Locate Collingwood's away team score:\n   - In the row where the \"home team\" is Essendon, the \"away team\" is Collingwood.\n   - The \"away team score\" for this match is 8.9 (57).\n\n4. Convert the scores to point values and compare them:\n   - Footscray's away team score: 3 goals and 5 behinds = (3 * 6) + (5 * 1) = 18 + 5 = 23 points.\n   - Collingwood's away team score: 8 goals and 9 behinds = (8 * 6) + (9 * 1) = 48 + 9 = 57 points.\n\n5.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"2 - third of home team have score higher than 10.0\", we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify all rows with their respective \"home team\" and \"home team score\".\n2. Count the total number of matches listed.\n3. Determine what constitutes \"a third\" of these matches.\n4. Check how many home teams scored more than 10 goals (\"home team score\" > 10.0).\n5. Compare this count to determine if it is at least two-thirds.\n\n### Step-by-step Evaluation:\n\n1. **Extract Relevant Data:**\n   - We focus on the \"home team\" and \"home team score\" columns for each row.\n   \n2. **Count Total Matches:**\n   - The data list contains 6 matches (rows).\n\n3. **Calculate Two-Thirds of Home Teams:**\n   - Two-thirds of 6 is calculated as \\((2/3) \\times 6 = 4\\).\n   - Therefore, we need at least 4 home teams to have scored more than 10 goals.\n\n4. **Evaluate Each Row for Home Team Score > 10.0:**\n   - Convert the \"home team score\" from the format 'x.y (z)' into a decimal representation of goals and behinds.\n     - The integer part before the period represents full goals, while the fractional part after the period can be converted to goals by dividing by 6.\n\n   - **Row 0:**\n     - Home Team: Hawthorn\n     - Score: 14.12 (96) \u2192 14 goals + \\( \\frac{12}{6} = 2\\) goals = 16 goals\n     - Result: > 10\n\n   - **Row 1:**\n     - Home Team: Fitzroy\n     - Score: 8.10 (58) \u2192 8 goals + \\( \\frac{10}{6} \\approx 1.67\\) goals \u2248 9.67 goals\n     - Result: < 10\n\n   - **Row 2:**\n     - Home Team: Richmond\n     - Score: 8.18 (66) \u2192 8 goals + \\( \\frac{18}{6} = 3\\) goals = 11 goals\n     - Result: > 10\n\n   - **Row 3:**\n     - Home Team: Geelong\n     - Score: 7.10 (52) \u2192 7 goals + \\( \\frac{10}{6} \\approx 1.67\\) goals \u2248 8.67 goals\n     - Result: < 10\n\n   - **Row 4:**\n     - Home Team: Essendon\n     - Score: 12.9 (81) \u2192 12 goals + \\( \\frac{9}{6} = 1.5\\) goals = 13.5 goals\n     - Result: > 10\n\n   - **Row 5:**\n     - Home Team: South Melbourne\n     - Score: 10.12 (72) \u2192 10 goals + \\( \\frac{12}{6} = 2\\) goals = 12 goals\n     - Result: > 10\n\n5. **Count Matches with Home Team Scores Greater Than 10:**\n   - Rows meeting the condition (>10 goals): Row 0, Row 2, Row 4, Row 5.\n   - Total count: 4 home teams scored more than 10.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since 4 is greater than or equal to the required number (4), the claim is supported.\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
