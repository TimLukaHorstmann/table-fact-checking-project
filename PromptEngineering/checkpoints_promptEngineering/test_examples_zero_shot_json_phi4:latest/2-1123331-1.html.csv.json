    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break it down and analyze it against the provided table:\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"hydraulics, drive by Damon Hill, have a grid number bigger than 1.\"\n\nThis involves three conditions that need verification:\n1. **Hydraulics:** The reason for retirement should be \"hydraulics.\"\n2. **Driver Damon Hill:** The driver associated with the reason should be Damon Hill.\n3. **Grid Number Bigger Than 1:** The grid position of this specific entry must be greater than 1.\n\n### Verification Steps:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify Entries with Hydraulics\n- Look for entries in the \"time / retired\" column where the value is \"hydraulics.\"\n\nFrom the table:\n- Damon Hill's entry: `\"hydraulics\"`\n- Ricardo Rosset's entry: `\"hydraulics\"`\n\nThus, rows 18 and 20 contain hydraulics.\n\n#### Step 2: Identify Entries with Driver Damon Hill\n- Look for entries in the \"driver\" column where the driver is Damon Hill.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Damon Hill's row has him as the driver (row 18).\n\n#### Step 3: Check Grid Number Condition\n- For Damon Hill, check if his grid number in the \"grid\" column is greater than 1.\n\nDamon Hill's entry shows a grid number of 7. Since 7 > 1, this condition is satisfied.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll conditions specified in the claim are met by Damon Hill's entry (row 18):\n- The reason for retirement is \"hydraulics.\"\n- The driver is indeed Damon Hill.\n- His starting grid position is 7, which is greater than 1.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row index 18 in the \"time / retired\" column (for hydraulics).\n- Row index 18 in the \"driver\" column (for Damon Hill).\n- Row index 18 in the \"grid\" column (for grid number > 1).\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
