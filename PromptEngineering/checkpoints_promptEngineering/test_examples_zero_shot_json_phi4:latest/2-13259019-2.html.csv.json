    "resp": "To verify the claim \"after week 10, the result of the game played at Soldier Field be w 31 - 29\", we need to analyze the data in the provided table with respect to each component of the claim:\n\n1. **Identify Games After Week 10**:\n   - The claim refers to a game that occurred after \"week 10\". Therefore, we are interested in weeks 11 through 16.\n\n2. **Check for Game at Soldier Field**:\n   - We need to find which game(s) took place at \"Soldier Field\". From the table data, only one entry has \"game site\" as \"soldier field\", and it occurs in week 10 with opponent \"chicago bears\".\n\n3. **Evaluate Result of the Game at Soldier Field**:\n   - The result for this specific game is already given in the table as \"w 31 - 29\". This matches the result mentioned in the claim.\n\n4. **Analyze Timing Relative to Week 10**:\n   - Since the game at \"Soldier Field\" occurred during week 10, it cannot be considered as occurring \"after week 10\".\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude:\n\n- The game with the specified result and site did occur, but not after week 10. It happened in week 10.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the condition of it happening \"after week 10\" is not met.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON response based on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
