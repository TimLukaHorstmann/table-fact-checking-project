Compare this value with the claim that states there is 1 drawn game.\n\nLet's examine the relevant part of the table:\n\n- The club name \"Featherstone Rovers\" appears in row index 7 (considering the first row is index 0).\n- In row index 7, under the column \"drawn,\" the value is 1.\n\nThis matches the claim that Featherstone Rovers have played exactly one drawn game out of their 18 games. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cell for verifying this information is:\n- Row index: 7\n- Column name: \"drawn\"\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

A club with 34 points.\n2. The same club having lost 6 games.\n\nLet's analyze each part of the claim using the provided JSON table:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Club with 34 Points\n- We look at the \"points\" column to find any entry equal to 34.\n- From the data:\n  - Row 4 corresponds to the \"leigh centurions\" club, which has 34 points.\n\n### Step 2: Check Number of Games Lost for This Club\n- For the \"leigh centurions,\" we check the \"lost\" column in row 4.\n- The number of games lost is 8.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim states that a club with 34 points has lost 6 games. However, the club with 34 points (leigh centurions) actually lost 8 games, not 6. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells from the table:\n- The \"points\" column in row 4 to verify the club has 34 points.\n- The \"lost\" column in row 4 to check how many games were lost by this club.\n\nThus, the JSON response should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
