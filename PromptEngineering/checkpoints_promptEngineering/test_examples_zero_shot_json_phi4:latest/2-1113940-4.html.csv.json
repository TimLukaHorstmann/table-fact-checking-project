From the JSON data, this is associated with \"steve corica (caretaker)\".\n\n2. **Verify Managed Matches**: The claim states that 2 matches were managed during this period. We check the \"managed\" column for \"steve corica (caretaker)\":\n   - Row: \"steve corica (caretaker)\"\n   - Column: \"managed\"\n   - Value: 2\n\n3. **Verify Lost Matches**: The claim states that 2 matches were lost during this period. We check the \"lost\" column for \"steve corica (caretaker)\":\n   - Row: \"steve corica (caretaker)\"\n   - Column: \"lost\"\n   - Value: 2\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data in the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"TRUE\", and the relevant cells are:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"managed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim about Terry Butcher's win percentage during a specified period, we need to analyze and verify relevant details from the provided table.\n\nThe claim states:\n\"Terry Butcher have a win % of 50% during the period october 2007 - march 2009.\"\n\n### Steps for Verification:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Period**: The claim specifies the time frame \"october 2007 - march 2009\". We need to check if Terry Butcher was managing any games during this period.\n\n2. **Find Information on Terry Butcher**:\n   - According to the table, Terry Butcher's period is listed as \"july 2006 - february 2007\" with a win percentage of \"39%\".\n\n3. **Verify Period Overlap**:\n   - Terry Butcher's management period (\"july 2006 - february 2007\") does not overlap at all with the specified claim period (\"october 2007 - march 2009\").\n   - Therefore, it is impossible for him to have a win percentage during \"october 2007 - march 2009\" since he was not managing during that time.\n\n4. **Check Win Percentage**:\n   - The table shows Terry Butcher's win percentage as \"39%\". There are no entries or data suggesting any change in his period or performance beyond what is listed.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: \n   - Since Terry Butcher did not manage during the specified claim period, it is false that he had a win percentage of 50% during \"october 2007 - march 2009\".\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cells to verify this claim are associated with Terry Butcher's details in the table:\n  - Row index: 1\n  - Columns: \"period\", \"win %\"\n\nHere is the JSON output with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"period\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"win %\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
