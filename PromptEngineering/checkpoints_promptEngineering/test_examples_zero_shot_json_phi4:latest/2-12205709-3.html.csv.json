The date column to find the entry for April 18.\n2. The score column to see what score is listed for that specific date.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- **Identify the Row**: First, locate the row where the \"date\" column has \"april 18.\" This corresponds to the row with index 12 in zero-based indexing (or the 13th row if using one-based indexing).\n\n- **Check the Score**: Once we have located the correct row, examine the \"score\" column for that date. \n\nUpon reviewing the data:\n- For April 18, the \"date\" is indeed listed as \"april 18.\"\n- The corresponding entry in the \"score\" column is \"7 - 0.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim that the score of the game held on April 18 was \"7 - 0\" matches the information in the table.\n\nBased on this verification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
