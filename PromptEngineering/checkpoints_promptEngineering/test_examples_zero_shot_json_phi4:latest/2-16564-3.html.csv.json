Identify the relevant columns for verification:\n   - The column \"year\" will help us identify entries from 1969.\n   - The column \"laps\" will provide the number of laps completed.\n\n2. Examine each row in the data to find a match for both conditions (year = 1969 and laps = 58).\n\n3. Check each row:\n   - Row index 0: year is 1961, not 1969.\n   - Row index 1: year is 1964, not 1969.\n   - Row index 2: year is 1969, and laps are 58.
