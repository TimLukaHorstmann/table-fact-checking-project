    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table in JSON format, we need to verify each condition specified in the claim against the data.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n1. \"nick price of zimbabwe\" should be present as a player.\n2. Nick Price should be placed at t4.\n3. Nick Price's score should be 70.\n4. Nick Price's score relative to par should be \"- 2\".\n\n### Verification Process:\n\n#### Step-by-step Verification:\n- **Row Identification**:\n  - We need to identify the row where \"nick price\" is listed as a player and check all corresponding details.\n\n- **Checking Player Name**:\n  - Find an entry with \"player\" equal to \"nick price\".\n  \n- **Verifying Nick Price's Country**:\n  - Ensure that in this same row, \"country\" equals \"zimbabwe\".\n\n- **Checking Placement**:\n  - Confirm that the \"place\" is listed as \"t4\".\n\n- **Validating Score and To Par**:\n  - Verify that \"score\" is 70.\n  - Ensure \"to par\" is \"- 2\".\n\n#### Relevant Row in Table:\nFrom the table, we find:\n\n| Place | Player      | Country   | Score | To Par |\n|-------|-------------|-----------|-------|--------|\n| t4    | nick price  | zimbabwe  | 70    | - 2    |\n\nThis row satisfies all conditions specified in the claim. Thus, each condition is verified to be true.\n\n#### Relevant Cells:\n- **Row Index**: The relevant row index for \"nick price\" with all conditions met is 3 (since JSON indexing starts at 0).\n- **Columns**:\n  - Column: place, value: t4\n  - Column: player, value: nick price\n  - Column: country, value: zimbabwe\n  - Column: score, value: 70\n  - Column: to par, value: - 2\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince all conditions in the claim are supported by the data in the table, the answer is \"TRUE\". Below is the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Canada have a low score of 70\" is true or false based on the given table, we need to verify specific conditions:\n\n1. **Identify if there's an entry related to Canada**: We will check each row in the data section for a player from Canada.\n\n2. **Check the 'score' value for that entry**: If the player is from Canada, we then look at their score to see if it matches 70.\n\n3. **Determine what \"a low score\" means**: The term \"low score\" is subjective, but within the context of this table (a golf leaderboard), a lower numerical score generally indicates better performance. We need to confirm that a score of 70 qualifies as relatively low compared to other scores in the list.\n\nLet's go through the data:\n\n- **Row Index 4**: Contains the entry for \"nick price\" from Zimbabwe with a score of 70.\n- **Row Index 5**: Contains the entry for \"mike weir\" from Canada with a score of 70.\n\nThe player \"mike weir\" is indeed from Canada and has a score of 70. Now, we need to determine if this can be considered a low score within the context of this table:\n\n- The scores range from 66 (Darren Clarke) to 72.\n- A score of 66 is -6 to par, which is better than any other listed scores.\n- Scores tied at 69 are -3 to par, indicating they're better than 70 (-2 to par).\n- Therefore, a score of 70 is not the lowest but is relatively low compared to higher scores like 71 or 72.\n\nGiven this context, \"a low score\" relative to other entries (even though it's not the lowest) can be considered valid for being competitive and better than many others.\n\nThus, the claim that \"Canada have a low score of 70\" is supported by the data.\n\nHere are the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- **Row Index 5**, Column: \"country\", as it identifies the player's country as Canada.\n- **Row Index 5**, Column: \"score\", as it shows the score for this player.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
