The number of points scored by Corinthians.\n2. The number of points scored by Br\u00e1s.\n\nThe relevant columns for this verification are \"points\" and the teams' names listed under \"team\".\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- **Corinthians**: \n  - Look at the row where the team is \"corinthians\".\n  - From the first row (index 0), we see that Corinthians scored 25 points.\n\n- **Br\u00e1s**:\n  - Look at the row where the team is \"br\u00e1s\".\n  - From the sixth row (index 6), we see that Br\u00e1s scored 10 points.\n\nNow, calculate the difference in points between Corinthians and Br\u00e1s:\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = \\text{Corinthians' Points} - \\text{Br\u00e1s' Points} = 25 - 10 = 15 \\]\n\nThe claim states that \"corinthian score 15 more point than br\u00e1s\".
