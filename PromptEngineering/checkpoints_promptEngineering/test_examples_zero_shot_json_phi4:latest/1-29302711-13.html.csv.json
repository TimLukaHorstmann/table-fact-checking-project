His rank is ninth.\n3. He participated in the 1973 world tennis circuit.\n\nLet's break down each component using the table data:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Component 1: Player's Name\n- We need to find if \"Roscoe Tanner\" exists in the \"name\" column of the table.\n- According to the data, Roscoe Tanner is present at row index 8.\n\n#### Component 2: Rank\n- Check if the rank (rk) for Roscoe Tanner is ninth.\n- In the provided data, Roscoe Tanner has a rank of 9, which corresponds to the ninth position. This matches with the claim.\n\n#### Component 3: Year of Participation\n- The claim specifies \"1973 world tennis circuit,\" but the table does not include any column related to the year or tournament specifics.\n- Therefore, we cannot verify this part using the given data alone; the table lacks necessary information regarding the specific year.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven that:\n- Roscoe Tanner is listed at rank 9 in the provided table (which supports the claim about his ranking).\n- The data does not specify any details about the year or tournament to confirm participation in the \"1973 world tennis circuit.\"\n\nBased on available information, we can verify the player's name and rank but cannot conclusively determine the specific event year. Thus, the claim is only partially supported by the table.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nTo support this evaluation, the relevant cells are:\n- The cell with Roscoe Tanner's name at row index 8.\n- The cell with his rank at row index 8.\n\nThe JSON object reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"rk\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis answer is based on the inability to verify the year-specific aspect of the claim due to missing information in the table.",
