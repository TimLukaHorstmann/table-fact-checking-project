    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"the season finale for season 4 be may 21 , 2008,\" we need to examine the relevant entries in the provided table. The claim focuses on two specific pieces of information: which row corresponds to season 4, and what is listed as the season finale date for that particular season.\n\n1. **Identify the Row for Season 4**:\n   - According to the table structure, each row corresponds to a different television season.\n   - We need to locate the row where the \"season\" column has a value of 4.\n\n2. **Check the Season Finale Date for Season 4**:\n   - Once we have identified the correct row, we will look at the \"season finale\" column within that row.\n   - The claim states that the season finale date should be May 21, 2008.\n\nLet's verify these steps using the provided data:\n\n- The table lists the seasons sequentially with their respective details. For Season 4:\n  - Row index: 3\n  - Season number: 4\n  - The \"season finale\" column shows \"may 21 , 2008.\"\n\nThus, the information in row 3 of the table supports the claim that the season finale for season 4 was on May 21, 2008.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- The relevant cells are found at row index 3 in the columns \"season\" and \"season finale.\"\n- The data within these cells confirms the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"season finale\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

For this particular season, the \"rank\" should be 21.\n\nFirstly, let's identify the relevant columns:\n- \"season premiere\" (to check for the date)\n- \"rank\" (to verify the rank value)\n\nNow, we will go through each row in the table to find a match:\n\n1. **Row 0**:\n   - \"season premiere\": September 22, 2004\n   - \"rank\": 21\n\nThe conditions are met for Row 0: The season premiere date matches \"September 22, 2004,\" and the rank is indeed 21.\n\nSince these conditions are satisfied with the data from Row 0, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE. \n\nHere is the JSON output with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"season premiere\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
