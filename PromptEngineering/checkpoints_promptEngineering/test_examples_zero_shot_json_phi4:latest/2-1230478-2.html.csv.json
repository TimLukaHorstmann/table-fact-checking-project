Count how many times any song by Phyllis Nelson has appeared on the US Hot 100 chart.\n\nNow let's analyze each row of the table:\n\n- **Row Index 0 (Year 1981):**\n  - Song: \"don't stop the train\"\n  - US Hot 100 Rank: \"-\"\n  - This entry does not make it to the US Hot 100, as indicated by \"-\".\n\n- **Row Index 1 (Year 1985, Single \"move closer\"):**\n  - Song: \"move closer\"\n  - US Hot 100 Rank: \"-\"\n  - This entry also does not appear on the US Hot 100.\n\n- **Row Index 2 (Year 1985, Single \"i don't know\"):**\n  - Song: \"i don't know\"\n  - US Hot 100 Rank: \"61\"\n  - This song appears once on the US Hot 100 chart at rank 61.\n\n- **Row Index 3 (Year 1985, Single \"i like you\"):**\n  - Song: \"i like you\"\n  - US Hot 100 Rank: \"61\"\n  - This is another entry that appears once on the US Hot 100 chart at rank 61. However, it's important to note that this is the same position as \"i don't know\" and thus counts as a different song appearance.\n\n- **Row Index 4 (Year 1994):**\n  - Song: \"move closer (re-issue)\"\n  - US Hot 100 Rank: \"-\"\n  - This entry does not make it to the US Hot 100 again, indicated by \"-\".\n\nFrom this analysis:\n\n- Phyllis Nelson's songs appear on the US Hot 100 two times:\n  1. \"i don't know\" at rank 61.\n  2. \"i like you\" at rank 61.\n\nThus, the claim that she made the US Hot 100 chart two times is true.

Phyllis Nelson's single 'don't stop the train' made it to the US Dance chart\":**\n   - Look for the row where \"single\" is \"don't stop the train\".\n   - Check if there are any entries in the \"US Dance\" column for this row.\n   \n2. **\"'Don't stop the train' did not make it to the US Hot 100 or US R&B chart\":**\n   - For the same row as above, check if there are entries in the \"US Hot 100\" and \"US R&B\" columns.\n\n**Verification Steps:**\n\n1. Identify the relevant row:\n   - The first entry in the data array corresponds to the year 1981 with \"single\" being \"don't stop the train\".\n\n2. Check the US Dance chart placement for \"Don't Stop the Train\":\n   - In the row indexed at 0, under the \"US Dance\" column, there is a value of \"20\", which means it did make it to the US Dance chart.\n\n3. Verify absence from the US Hot 100 and US R&B charts:\n   - For the same row (index 0), both \"US Hot 100\" and \"US R&B\" columns have \"-\" indicating no placement on these charts.\n\n4. Confirm there are no other singles by F. Phyllis Nelson that made it to the US Dance chart:\n   - Examine all rows for entries in the \"US Dance\" column.\n   - The only entry with a number is row 0 (\"Don't Stop the Train\").\n   - Other singles like \"Move Closer\", \"I Don't Know\", and \"I Like You\" have placements on the US Dance chart (1) but not related to \"Don't Stop the Train\".\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The claim states that only one of F. Phyllis Nelson's singles, \"don't stop the train,\" made it to the US Dance chart.\n- This is true as verified by the entry in row 0 under \"US Dance\".\n- Additionally, it did not make it to either the US Hot 100 or US R&B charts, confirmed by the entries in columns \"US Hot 100\" and \"US R&B\" for the same row.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.

Thus, she was able to chart twice in that year.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.
