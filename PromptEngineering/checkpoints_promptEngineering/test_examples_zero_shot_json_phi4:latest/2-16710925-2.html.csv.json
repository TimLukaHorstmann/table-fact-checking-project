    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two specific parts of it against the data in the table:\n\n1. **Week 14 Date**: The claim states that Week 14 should be on September 26, 1971.\n2. **Attendance for Week 14**: According to the claim, the attendance for this week should be 57,895.\n\nLet's verify these points using the provided JSON data:\n\n- We look through the \"data\" list in the table to find the entry corresponding to \"week 14\". The relevant row is:\n  ```json\n  [\n    13,\n    \"december 19 , 1971\",\n    \"san francisco 49ers\",\n    \"l 24 - 3\",\n    44582\n  ]\n  ```\n- From this row, we see that Week 14 actually took place on December 19, 1971, not September 26, 1971.\n- Additionally, the attendance for this game was 44,582, not 57,895.\n\nThus, both conditions in the claim are false when compared to the actual data. Therefore, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nTo provide the relevant cells:\n\n- For verifying the week number and date:\n  - Row index: 13\n  - Column names: \"week\" and \"date\"\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
