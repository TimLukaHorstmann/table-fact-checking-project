    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the Victorian Football League (VFL) season being its 65th is true or false based on the provided table, we need to analyze the data:\n\n### Claim Analysis\n\nThe claim states:\n- \"the 1961 VFL season be the 65th season of the elite Australian rule football competition.\"\n\nTo verify this, we need to consider:\n1. The historical context of the VFL.\n2. Whether the year 1961 corresponds to the 65th season.\n\n### Historical Context\n\nThe Victorian Football League (VFL) was established in 1897 as a breakaway league from the Victorian Football Association (VFA). The first official season began in 1897. \n\nTo verify if 1961 is indeed the 65th season, we calculate:\n- The number of seasons from 1897 to 1961 inclusive.\n\n#### Calculation\n\n1. **Starting Year:** 1897\n2. **Ending Year for Claim:** 1961\n\nThe number of years between 1897 and 1961 (inclusive) is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of Seasons} = 1961 - 1897 + 1 = 65 \\]\n\nThis calculation shows that the 1961 season would indeed be the 65th season.\n\n### Table Analysis\n\nThe table provided lists matches from a specific date in 1961, but it does not directly state or confirm historical information about the VFL's establishment or the number of its seasons. However, the date \"26 August 1961\" across all rows confirms that these games are part of the 1961 season.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on historical data and calculations:\n- The claim is TRUE.\n- The table itself does not directly verify this claim but supports it by showing matches from the year in question.\n\nSince no specific cells in the table provide direct information about the number of seasons, we do not need to refer to any particular cell for verification. However, the presence of games dated \"26 August 1961\" supports the context that these are part of the 1961 season.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

However, since all events occur on the same date (26 August 1961), it implies they could be part of the same round.\n\n2. **\"all event take place on 26 august 1961\"**: We need to verify that each match listed in the table occurred on this date.\n\n3. **\"victorian football league\"**: The data includes teams and venues that are consistent with those found in the Victorian Football League (VFL) during the era, but there is no explicit mention of \"Victorian Football League\" in the table. However, given historical context, it can be inferred that these matches were part of the VFL.\n\nNow, let's verify each row against the claim:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Date: \"26 august 1961\"\n  \n- **Row 1**:\n  - Date: \"26 august 1961\"\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Date: \"26 august 1961\"\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Date: \"26 august 1961\"\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Date: \"26 august 1961\"\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Date: \"26 august 1961\"\n\nAll rows confirm that the events took place on 26 August 1961.

We will extract the crowd size from each row and find out which one has the least number of people.\n\nHere are the steps to verify the claim:\n\n1. Identify the crowd sizes for each match:\n   - Footscray vs. Geelong at Western Oval: 42,015\n   - Fitzroy vs. South Melbourne at Brunswick Street Oval: 12,815\n   - Carlton vs. Melbourne at Princes Park: 21,863\n   - St Kilda vs. North Melbourne at Junction Oval: 24,250\n   - Richmond vs. Hawthorn at Punt Road Oval: 15,177\n   - Essendon vs. Collingwood at Windy Hill: 18,500\n\n2.

Verify which venue corresponds to this smallest crowd size:\n   - The match with a crowd of 12,815 was between Fitzroy and South Melbourne at Brunswick Street Oval.\n\nThe claim states that \"Brunswick Street Oval be the venue with the least amount of crowd.\" Based on our analysis, this is indeed true because Brunswick Street Oval had the smallest attendance number (12,815).\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is TRUE.
