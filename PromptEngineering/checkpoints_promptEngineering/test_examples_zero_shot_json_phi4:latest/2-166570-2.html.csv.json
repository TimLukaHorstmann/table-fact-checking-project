    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine each entry in the table where the \"country\" column is \"us\" and the \"town\" column contains a location within Florida. Then, identify the most recent structure by looking at the \"year\" column for these entries.\n\nHere's a step-by-step process:\n\n1. Identify rows with the country as \"us\" and the town in Florida:\n   - Row 17: Town = \"bethlehem\", Year = 1978\n   - Row 19: Town = \"princeton\", Year = 1993\n   - Row 20: Town = \"saint cloud\", Year = 2000\n\n2. From these entries, determine the most recent structure based on the year:\n   - 1978 (bethlehem)\n   - 1993 (princeton)\n   - 2000 (saint cloud)\n\nThe most recent entry is for the town of \"saint cloud\" with a year of 2000.\n\n3. Compare this to the claim, which states that the most recent structure in Florida has the year 1976. The claim is incorrect because the most recent structure's year is actually 2000.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"FALSE.\"\n\nRelevant cells are those related to Florida structures:\n- Row 17 (bethlehem, florida) - Year: 1978\n- Row 19 (princeton, florida) - Year: 1993\n- Row 20 (saint cloud, florida) - Year: 2000\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"town\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"town\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"town\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
