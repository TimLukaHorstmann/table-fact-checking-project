Check all episodes in the table to see if any other episode besides \"The Other Poland\" lists Poland as a country visited.\n\nLet's break down the steps using the data provided:\n\n1. **Locate the Episode with Title \"The Other Poland\":**\n   - We find that in row 1 (index 2 considering zero-based indexing), the title is indeed \"the other poland.\"\n   - In this same row, under the column \"countries visited,\" it lists \"poland.\"\n\n2. **Verify If Any Other Episodes List Poland as a Country Visited:**\n   - We need to examine each episode's entry in the \"countries visited\" column for any mention of Poland.\n   - By reviewing all rows:\n     - Row 0 (\"the gold rush line\"): countries visited are \"alaska, usa and yukon, canada.\"\n     - Row 1 (\"the other poland\"): countries visited is \"poland.\"\n     - Row 2 (\"slow train to olympia\"): countries visited is \"greece.\"\n     - Row 3 (\"the dragons of sugar island\"): countries visited is \"philippines.\"\n     - Row 4 (\"line of dreams\"): countries visited is \"india.\"\n     - Row 5 (\"journey to the land beyond the mountains\"): countries visited is \"portugal.\"\n     - Row 6 (\"the good and the quick\"): countries visited is \"ecuador.\"\n\nFrom this analysis, only row 1 (index 2) lists Poland as a country visited.
