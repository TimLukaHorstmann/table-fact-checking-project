    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Francis II be the spouse of the queen who be the daughter of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies,\" we need to verify the following conditions:\n\n1. Identify the queen who is the daughter of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies.\n2. Check if Francis II was her spouse.\n\nLet's break this down using the table provided:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Queen\n\n- We look at the \"father\" column for entries that match \"Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies.\"\n- From the data:\n  - Row index 1 has \"maria teresa of the two sicilies\" with \"ferdinand i of the two sicilies\" as her father.\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Spouse\n\n- For the identified queen (Maria Teresa of the Two Sicilies), check if Francis II is listed as her spouse.\n- In row index 1, under the \"spouse\" column, it shows \"francis ii.\"\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied:\n\n1. Maria Teresa of the Two Sicilies is indeed the daughter of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies.\n2. Francis II was her spouse.\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the data.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"father\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"spouse\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify two main points:\n\n1. **Francis II being the spouse of Elisabeth of Bavaria**:\n   - Look at the row corresponding to \"Elisabeth of Bavaria\" in the table.\n   - Check the \"spouse\" column for this row.\n\n2. **Elisabeth of Bavaria being the daughter of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies**:\n   - Again, look at the row corresponding to \"Elisabeth of Bavaria\".\n   - Check the \"father\" column for this row and see if it matches \"Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies\".\n\nLet's verify these conditions using the table data:\n\n1. **Checking Elisabeth of Bavaria's spouse**:\n   - From the table, in the row with \"Elisabeth of Bavaria\", the \"spouse\" column shows \"francis joseph i\".\n   - Therefore, Francis II is not her spouse.\n\n2. **Checking Elisabeth of Bavaria's father**:\n   - In the same row for \"Elisabeth of Bavaria\", the \"father\" column shows \"maximilian joseph , duke in bavaria\".\n   - This does not match \"Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies\".\n\nSince neither condition is satisfied, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells to verify:\n- Elisabeth of Bavaria's spouse: Row index 5, Column name \"spouse\"\n- Elisabeth of Bavaria's father: Row index 5, Column name \"father\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"spouse\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"father\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
