This implies that if there are \\( n \\) total games, then \\( n/2 \\) games should have occurred on \"1 August 1936\".\n\n### Steps to Verify the Claim:\n1. **Count Total Games**: Determine how many rows (games) are listed in the table.\n2. **Check Dates**: For each game, verify if the date is \"1 August 1936\".\n3. **Calculate Proportion**: Calculate what fraction of games were played on this specific date and compare it with half.\n\n### Table Analysis:\n- The JSON data has a list of games under \"data\" where each sub-list represents one row corresponding to a game.\n- Each row contains the date of the game in the last column, labeled as \"date\".\n\n#### Table Data Count:\n- There are 6 rows in total (from index 0 to 5).\n\n#### Date Verification:\n- Check each row's \"date\" value:\n\n  - Row 0: \"1 August 1936\"\n  - Row 1: \"1 August 1936\"\n  - Row 2: \"1 August 1936\"\n  - Row 3: \"1 August 1936\"\n  - Row 4: \"1 August 1936\"\n  - Row 5: \"1 August 1936\"\n\nAll games listed in the table took place on \"1 August 1936\".
