    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to check two key conditions from the table:\n\n1. Identify when the game against the Cleveland Browns took place.\n2. Identify when the game against the Detroit Lions took place.\n3. Verify if the game against the Detroit Lions occurred exactly one week after the game against the Cleveland Browns.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n#### 1. Game Against Cleveland Browns\n- From the table, find the entry where the opponent is \"cleveland browns.\"\n- This occurs in row 0:\n  - Week: 1\n  - Date: September 3, 1978\n  - Opponent: Cleveland Browns\n  - Result: L 24 - 7\n\n#### 2. Game Against Detroit Lions\n- Next, find the entry where the opponent is \"detroit lions.\"\n- This occurs in row 15:\n  - Week: 16\n  - Date: December 17, 1978\n  - Opponent: Detroit Lions\n  - Result: L 33 - 14\n\n#### 3. Check the Timing Between the Games\n- The game against the Cleveland Browns is in week 1 on September 3, 1978.\n- The game against the Detroit Lions is in week 16 on December 17, 1978.\n- To determine if these games are exactly one week apart, calculate the number of weeks between them:\n  - Week for Cleveland Browns: 1\n  - Week for Detroit Lions: 16\n- Weeks between: 16 - 1 = 15 weeks\n\nSince there is a difference of 15 weeks between the two games, they did not occur one week apart.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim that \"the game against the detroit lion take place 1 week after the game against the cleveland brown\" is **FALSE**.
