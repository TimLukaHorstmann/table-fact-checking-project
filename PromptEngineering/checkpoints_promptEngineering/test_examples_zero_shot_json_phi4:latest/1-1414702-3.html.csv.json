Finding the Row:\n- First, identify which row corresponds to Mount Tahoma High School. By scanning through the `data` section in the JSON, we find that Mount Tahoma High School is listed at **row index 2**.\n\n#### 2. Verifying Established Year:\n- Look for the \"established\" column (index 3) at row index 2.\n- The value here should be 1961 to match the claim.\n\n#### 3. Verifying School Type:\n- Check the \"type\" column (index 1) at row index 2.\n- The type should be \"comprehensive\" as stated in the claim.\n\n### Verification with Data:\n\n- **Row Index 2, Column 'established'**: The value is `1961`, which matches the year given in the claim.\n- **Row Index 2, Column 'type'**: The value is `\"comprehensive\"`, which confirms that the school type is correct as per the claim.\n\nBoth conditions required by the claim are met based on the data from the table.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince both relevant pieces of information (established year and type) align with the details provided in the claim, we can conclude that the claim is true. \n\nHere's the JSON response with the relevant cells identified:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"established\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
