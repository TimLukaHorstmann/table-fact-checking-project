    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Gary Koch finished 5 spots ahead of Tsuneyuki Nakajima,\" we need to compare their finishing positions in the provided table.\n\n1. **Identify Gary Koch's Position:**\n   - Look for the row with \"gary koch\" under the \"player\" column.\n   - From the data, we find:\n     ```json\n     [\n       \"t8\",\n       \"gary koch\",\n       \"united states\",\n       \"69 + 74 = 143\",\n       \"- 1\"\n     ]\n     ```\n   - Gary Koch's position is tied for 8th place (indicated by \"t8\").\n\n2. **Identify Tsuneyuki Nakajima's Position:**\n   - Look for the row with \"tsuneyuki nakajima\" under the \"player\" column.\n   - From the data, we find:\n     ```json\n     [\n       \"3\",\n       \"tsuneyuki nakajima\",\n       \"japan\",\n       \"70 + 71 = 139\",\n       \"- 3\"\n     ]\n     ```\n   - Tsuneyuki Nakajima's position is 3rd place.\n\n3. **Compare the Positions:**\n   - Gary Koch is in a tie for 8th place.\n   - Tsuneyuki Nakajima is in 3rd place.\n   - The difference in their positions is \\(8 - 3 = 5\\).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that Gary Koch finished \"5 spots ahead\" of Tsuneyuki Nakajima, but the table shows that he actually finished 5 spots behind.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the japan player is 3 stroke back from seve ballesteros,\" we need to determine the difference in their scores based on the table provided.\n\n1. **Identify Seve Ballesteros' Score and Stroke Position:**\n   - Seve Ballesteros is ranked 1st.\n   - His score is \"71 + 68 = 139\" and his position relative to par is \"-5\".\n\n2. **Identify Tsuneyuki Nakajima's (Japan Player) Score and Stroke Position:**\n   - Tsuneyuki Nakajima is ranked 3rd.\n   - His score is \"70 + 71 = 141\" and his position relative to par is \"-3\".\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Scores:**\n   - Seve Ballesteros' total strokes: 139\n   - Tsuneyuki Nakajima's total strokes: 141\n   - The difference in strokes between them is \\(141 - 139 = 2\\).\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the Japan player is \"3 stroke back\" from Seve Ballesteros.\n   - Based on our calculation, Tsuneyuki Nakajima is actually only 2 strokes behind Seve Ballesteros.\n\nSince the actual difference in strokes is 2 and not 3 as claimed, the claim is FALSE.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - For Seve Ballesteros:\n     - Row index 0, Column \"score\" (71 + 68 = 139)\n     - Row index 0, Column \"to par\" (-5)\n   - For Tsuneyuki Nakajima:\n     - Row index 2, Column \"score\" (70 + 71 = 141)\n     - Row index 2, Column \"to par\" (-3)\n\nThe relevant cells are thus identified based on the scores and their respective positions to determine the stroke difference.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
