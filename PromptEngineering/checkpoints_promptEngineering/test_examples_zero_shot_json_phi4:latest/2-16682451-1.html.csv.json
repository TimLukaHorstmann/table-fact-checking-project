These victories occurred in three different countries: Tunisia, Scotland, and Nigeria.\n\nLet's break down these conditions based on the data provided:\n\n### Condition 1: Runner Won 1st Position Four Times\n- **2005**: At \"African Junior Championships\" in Rad\u00e8s, Tunisia for both \"5000 m\" and \"10000 m\", the runner finished 1st.\n- **2008**: At \"World Cross Country Championships\" in Edinburgh, Scotland for \"team competition\", the runner finished 1st.\n- **2013**: At \"Okpekpe International Road Race\" in Okpekpe, Nigeria for \"10 kilometres\", the runner finished 1st.\n\nFrom the table, we see that the runner indeed has four instances of winning 1st position. The relevant rows are:\n\n- Row 1: 2005, African Junior Championships, Rad\u00e8s, Tunisia, 5000 m\n- Row 2: 2005, African Junior Championships, Rad\u00e8s, Tunisia, 10000 m\n- Row 6: 2008, World Cross Country Championships, Edinburgh, Scotland, team competition\n- Row 7: 2013, Okpekpe International Road Race, Okpekpe, Nigeria, 10 kilometres\n\n### Condition 2: Victories in Three Different Countries\nThe three countries mentioned in the claim are Tunisia, Scotland, and Nigeria. From our findings:\n\n- **Tunisia**: The runner won twice (Rows 1 and 2).\n- **Scotland**: The runner won once (Row 6).\n- **Nigeria**: The runner won once (Row 7).\n\nThis confirms that the victories occurred in three different countries as stated.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied: the runner won 1st position four times, and these victories were achieved in Tunisia, Scotland, and Nigeria.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two specific conditions against the given data:\n\n1. The claim mentions an event in 2007 related to \"10000 m\".\n2. The claim mentions an event in 2009 related to \"5000 m\".\n\nLet's examine each part of the claim with respect to the table:\n\n### Step 1: Verify the 2007 Event\n\n- **Claim**: In 2007, there was a \"10000 m\" event.\n- **Relevant Row for 2007**:\n  - Year: 2007\n  - Competition: world athletics final\n  - Venue: stuttgart , germany\n  - Position: 3rd\n  - Event: 5000 m\n\nFrom the data, there is no \"10000 m\" event in 2007. The only event mentioned for that year is a \"5000 m\". Therefore, this part of the claim is false.\n\n### Step 2: Verify the 2009 Event\n\n- **Claim**: In 2009, there was a \"5000 m\" event.\n- **Relevant Row for 2009**:\n  - Year: 2009\n  - Competition: world championships\n  - Venue: berlin , germany\n  - Position: 3rd\n  - Event: 10000 m\n\nFrom the data, there is no \"5000 m\" event in 2009. The only event mentioned for that year is a \"10000 m\". Therefore, this part of the claim is also false.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince neither condition of the claim is supported by the data, the entire claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells to verify these conditions are:\n\n- For 2007, checking the event type: \n  - Row index: 3 (corresponds to the year 2007)\n  - Column name: \"event\"\n\n- For 2009, checking the event type:\n  - Row index: 6 (corresponds to the year 2009)\n  - Column name: \"event\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
