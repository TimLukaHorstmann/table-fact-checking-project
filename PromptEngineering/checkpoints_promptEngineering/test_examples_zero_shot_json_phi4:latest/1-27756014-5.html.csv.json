    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the most points scored by a single player in a game during November of the 2010-11 Milwaukee Bucks season, we need to verify two specific aspects:\n\n1. Identify the highest point score by a single player in any game listed for November.\n2. Confirm if this high score occurred on November 16 against the Lakers (not \"trailblazer\" as stated in the claim).\n\nLet's go through each relevant game and their top scorers from the provided data:\n\n- **November 2 vs. Portland**: Corey Maggette scored 16 points.\n- **November 3 vs. Boston**: Andrew Bogut scored 21 points.\n- **November 5 vs. Indiana**: John Salmons scored 22 points.\n- **November 6 vs. New Orleans**: Andrew Bogut scored 19 points.\n- **November 9 vs. New York**: Brandon Jennings scored 19 points.\n- **November 10 vs. Atlanta**: Corey Maggette scored 20 points.\n- **November 13 vs. Golden State**: John Salmons scored 26 points.\n- **November 16 vs. Los Angeles Lakers**: Brandon Jennings scored 31 points.\n- **November 19 vs. Philadelphia**: Corey Maggette scored 20 points.\n- **November 20 vs. Oklahoma City**: Brandon Jennings scored 25 points.\n- **November 24 vs. Cleveland**: Keyon Dooling scored 18 points.\n- **November 26 vs. Detroit**: Brandon Jennings scored 25 points.\n\nFrom this examination, we can see that the highest number of points scored by a single player in November was indeed by Brandon Jennings with 31 points on November 16 against the Lakers. The claim mentions \"trailblazer\" which seems to be an error because the team played was the Los Angeles Lakers, not the Trail Blazers.\n\nThus, based on this analysis:\n\n- The claim's statement about 37 points is incorrect as it should be 31.\n- The date and opposing team are correct (November 16 against the Lakers).\n\nTherefore, the entire claim is false due to the inaccurate point total mentioned. \n\nHere is the JSON response with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe relevant cells include the high points scored on November 13 against Golden State (John Salmons) and November 16 against Los Angeles Lakers (Brandon Jennings). These entries confirm that Brandon Jennings had the highest score of 31 in a single game during November, not 37.",
