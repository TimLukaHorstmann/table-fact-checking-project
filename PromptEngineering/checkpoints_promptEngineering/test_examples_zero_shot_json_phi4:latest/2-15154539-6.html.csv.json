Whether these games were part of the 1998-99 FA Cup.\n\nLet's go through each step:\n\n### Step 1: Verify the Number of Games on February 13, 1999\n\nWe will examine the \"attendance\" column for entries dated \"13 february 1999\":\n\n- Row 0 (Game 1): \"13 february 1999\"\n- Row 2 (Game 3): \"14 february 1999\" (not relevant)\n- Row 4 (Game 4): \"13 february 1999\"\n- Row 5 (Game 5): \"14 february 1999\" (not relevant)\n- Row 6 (Game 6): \"13 february 1999\"\n- Row 7 (Replay of Game 7): \"13 february 1999\"\n- Row 8 (Game 8): \"13 february 1999\"\n\nFrom this, we can count that games on February 13, 1999, are in rows: 0, 4, 6, 7, and 8. This totals to five games.\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Context of the Games\n\nThe claim specifies that these were FA Cup games from the 1998-99 season. While the table doesn't explicitly state this information, we assume it is correct based on the context provided in the question. The table format suggests a sports schedule related to such an event.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states \"6 game[s] take place on 13 February 1999 during the 1998 - 99 FA Cup.\" We found only five games on that date, so the claim is not fully supported by the data.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
