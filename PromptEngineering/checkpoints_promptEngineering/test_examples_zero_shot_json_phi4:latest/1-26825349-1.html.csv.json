While numerically equivalent, JSON data often treats integers and floating-point numbers differently due to their types.\n\nTherefore, since the claim explicitly uses \"9.0\", which is a float, whereas the table has an integer \"9\", they are not exactly the same in type.\n\nThus, based on the strict interpretation of the claim with its specified type (float), we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
