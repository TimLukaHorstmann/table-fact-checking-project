    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate two main conditions from the claim:\n\n1. The episode number must be 4.\n2. The original airdate for this episode should be June 8, 2008.\n\nLet's check these conditions against the data in the table:\n\n- Look at each row where \"episode\" is specified and compare it with the given episode number (which is 4).\n- Verify if the corresponding \"original airdate\" for this episode matches June 8, 2008.\n\nRelevant cells from the JSON data:\n- The \"episode\" column to find episodes numbered as 4.\n- The \"original airdate\" column to confirm the date matches June 8, 2008.\n\nNow, let's analyze the rows:\n\n1. Row index 3 has:\n   - Episode number: 4\n   - Original airdate: \"8 june 2008\"\n\nThis row satisfies both conditions of the claim: it is episode 4 and airs on June 8, 2008. There are no other episodes with a lower episode number that air on this date.\n\nThus, the claim is true because episode 4 is indeed the earliest episode to originally air on June 8, 2008.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding the table data, let's break down and verify each condition:\n\n1. **Original Airdate Condition**: The claim specifies an original airdate of \"8 June 2008\". We need to find the row(s) in the data where the \"original airdate\" column matches this date.\n\n2. **Viewership Data**: Once we identify the relevant episode based on the date, we must determine if its viewership is indeed the least among all episodes. The claim does not specify any particular criterion other than checking for the least watched episode; thus, we will compare viewership numbers directly.\n\n3. **Episode Number Check**: The claim specifies that the \"least watched\" episode's number should be 4. We need to check if this condition is met after identifying the episode with the lowest viewership on the given date.\n\nLet's proceed step-by-step:\n\n- **Identify Episodes with Original Airdate of 8 June 2008**:\n  - From the data, we find that row index 3 has \"original airdate\" as \"8 june 2008\".\n\n- **Determine Least Watched Episode Based on Viewership (in Millions)**:\n  - We need to compare viewership numbers across all episodes to identify the one with the lowest number.\n  - The viewership data is as follows:\n    - Episode 1: 1.351 million\n    - Episode 2: 1.481 million\n    - Episode 3: 1.514 million\n    - Episode 4: 1.364 million\n    - Episode 5: 1.515 million\n    - Episode 6: 1.506 million\n    - Episode 7: 1.512 million\n    - Episode 8: 1.578 million\n    - Episode 9: 1.68 million\n    - Episode 10: 1.432 million\n    - Episode 11: 1.547 million\n    - Episode 12: 1.462 million\n    - Episode 13: 1.349 million\n    - Episode 14: 1.677 million\n    - Episode 15: 1.324 million\n  \n- **Identify the Least Watched Episode**:\n  - The lowest viewership number is 1.324 million, which corresponds to episode 15.\n\n- **Check if Episode Number Matches Claim**:\n  - The claim states that the least watched episode with the original airdate of \"8 June 2008\" should be episode 4.\n  - However, we have determined that the least watched episode overall is episode 15, not episode 4. Thus, episode 4 does not meet the criteria for being the least watched.\n\nTherefore, based on our analysis:\n\n- The relevant cells to verify are:\n  - \"row_index\" of 3 for \"original airdate\" and \"viewers (millions)\" since it pertains to \"8 June 2008\".\n  - Additionally, comparing all viewership data is necessary, but specific row indices include those with the lowest viewership: 0 (\"1.351\"), 13 (\"1.349\"), and 14 (\"1.324\").\n\nSince the least watched episode number (15) does not match the claim of being episode 4 for \"8 June 2008\", the answer to the claim is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"viewers (millions)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
