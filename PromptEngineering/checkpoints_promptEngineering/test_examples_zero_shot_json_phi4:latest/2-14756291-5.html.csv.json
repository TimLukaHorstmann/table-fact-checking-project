    "resp": "To verify the claim about the table data provided in JSON format, we need to check two specific conditions mentioned in the claim:\n\n1. **\"bridgenorth have the highest number of wins in the NTFA Div.\"**  \n   - This requires checking if Bridgenorth has more wins than any other team listed in the \"wins\" column.\n   \n2. **\"...with 15 win and only 3 loss\"**  \n   - This requires confirming that Bridgenorth's record shows exactly 15 wins and 3 losses.\n\nLet's analyze each condition using the data:\n\n### Analyzing Condition 1:\n- We need to compare the number of wins for all teams in the \"wins\" column.\n- The \"wins\" data for each team is as follows:\n  - Bridgenorth: 15\n  - Rocherlea: 13\n  - Bracknell: 12\n  - George Town: 9\n  - Scottsdale: 8\n  - Deloraine: 6\n  - Longford: 5\n  - Hillwood: 1\n\n- Bridgenorth, with 15 wins, indeed has the highest number of wins compared to all other teams.\n\n### Analyzing Condition 2:\n- Check that Bridgenorth's record in the \"wins\" and \"losses\" columns matches the claim.\n  - Wins for Bridgenorth: 15 (matches the claim)\n  - Losses for Bridgenorth: 3 (also matches the claim)\n\nBased on these checks, both conditions of the claim are supported by the data. Therefore, the answer to the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells used to verify this claim:\n\n- **Row Index 0** (Bridgenorth):\n  - Column \"wins\": 15\n  - Column \"losses\": 3\n\nThus, the JSON object representing our conclusion and relevant cells is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"losses\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

However, only the second condition is met (less than 2 draws), while the first condition (exactly 8 wins) is not satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells from the table that were used to evaluate these conditions are:\n- Row index 3, column \"wins\" for checking the number of wins.\n- Row index 3, column \"draws\" for checking the number of draws.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"draws\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
