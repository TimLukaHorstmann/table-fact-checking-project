    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"there be a crowd of 74656 for essendon home team on 26 june 1952,\" we must verify it against the provided data in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - We need to check if there is an entry for the Essendon home team match on \"26 June 1982\" because the claim specifies a date, and this is the only date available in our data.\n   - From the table data:\n     ```json\n     [\n       [\"essendon\", \"15.15 (105)\", \"north melbourne\", \"14.13 (97)\", \"mcg\", 47656, \"26 june 1982\"]\n     ]\n     ```\n   - This row indicates Essendon played at home on this date.\n\n2. **Check Crowd Size:**\n   - The claim mentions a crowd of 74656.\n   - From the identified row for Essendon:\n     - The crowd size recorded is 47656, not 74656 as claimed.\n\n3. **Verify Date and Home Team:**\n   - The date in the table matches \"26 June 1982,\" which corresponds to the claim's date.\n   - The home team is indeed Essendon, matching the claim's condition for the home team.\n\n4. **Incorrect Year Mentioned:**\n   - Although not directly relevant since the year isn't a field in our data, it\u2019s noted that the claim incorrectly refers to \"26 June 1952\" while all matches are from \"26 June 1982\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe crowd size and date conditions do not fully match those specified in the claim. The actual crowd was 47656, and the year mentioned (1952) does not align with any data available.\n\nThus, based on these analyses, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n- For the row corresponding to Essendon's match, we need to check:\n  - Column: \"crowd\"\n  - Column: \"date\"\n\nGiven this analysis, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
