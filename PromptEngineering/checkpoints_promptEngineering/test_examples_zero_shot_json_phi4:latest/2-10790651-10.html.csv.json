    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding the match between Richmond and Collingwood on June 29, 1935, we need to verify several pieces of information from the provided table:\n\n1. **Match Details**: We check if there is a row in the data for a match between Richmond and Collingwood.\n\n2. **Scores**: We confirm that Richmond scored 11.14 (80) and Collingwood scored 13.4 (82).\n\n3. **Point Difference**: We calculate the point difference to see if it is indeed only 4 points.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. **Identifying the Match**:\n   - In row index 4, we find the match between Richmond and Collingwood at Punt Road Oval with a crowd of 25,000 on June 29, 1935.\n\n2. **Verifying Scores**:\n   - For Richmond (home team in this row), the score is \"11.14 (80)\".\n   - For Collingwood (away team in this row), the score is \"13.4 (82)\".\n\n3. **Calculating Point Difference**:\n   - The point difference is calculated as 82 (Collingwood) - 80 (Richmond) = 2 points.\n\nThe claim states that the closest match was separated by only 4 points, but our calculation shows a 2-point difference between Richmond and Collingwood. Therefore, the statement about the point difference being 4 is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant cells for verification are:\n- Row index 4, \"home team score\" (11.14 (80))\n- Row index 4, \"away team score\" (13.4 (82))\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the point difference is 2, not 4.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding crowd attendance at different venues in the table provided, we need to focus on two main aspects:\n\n1. **Identify the venue with the most number of spectators:**\n   - The relevant data is under the \"crowd\" column.\n   - We will compare all values under this column to find the maximum value.\n\n2. **Identify the venue with the least number of spectators:**\n   - Again, we look at the \"crowd\" column for comparison.\n   - We will identify the minimum value in this column.\n\n3. **Verify the venues associated with these maximum and minimum values:**\n   - Check which row corresponds to Corio Oval (for the claim about having the most spectators).\n   - Check which row corresponds to Punt Road Oval (for the claim about having the least spectators).\n\nLet's analyze the data:\n\n| Row | Venue          | Crowd |\n|-----|----------------|-------|\n| 0   | corio oval     | 7000  |\n| 1   | brunswick street oval | 11000 |\n| 2   | lake oval      | 19000 |\n| 3   | glenferrie oval| 9000  |\n| 4   | punt road oval | 25000 |\n| 5   | windy hill     | 18000 |\n\n- **Maximum Crowd:** 25000 at Punt Road Oval (Row 4)\n- **Minimum Crowd:** 7000 at Corio Oval (Row 0)\n\nNow, let's verify the claim:\n\nThe claim states:\n1. \"Corio Oval have the most number of spectators.\"\n2. \"Punt Road Oval have the least number of crowd attend.\"\n\nFrom our analysis:\n1. The maximum attendance is at Punt Road Oval, not Corio Oval.\n2. The minimum attendance is at Corio Oval, not Punt Road Oval.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are in the \"crowd\" column across all rows:\n\n- Row 0: Corio Oval with 7000 spectators\n- Row 4: Punt Road Oval with 25000 spectators\n\nThus, the JSON response is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states that none of the venues had more than 7000 spectators.\n\nHere's a step-by-step evaluation:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: \n   - The \"crowd\" column contains the number of spectators.\n   - The \"date\" column should be checked to ensure it matches June 29, 1935.\n\n2. **Check Each Row**:\n   - All rows have the date \"29 june 1935\", so we only need to check the \"crowd\" values.\n\n3. **Evaluate Crowd Numbers**:\n   - **Row 0**: Geelong vs North Melbourne at Corio Oval with a crowd of 7000.\n     - This is exactly 7000, not more than 7000.\n   - **Row 1**: Fitzroy vs Melbourne at Brunswick Street Oval with a crowd of 11000.\n     - This exceeds 7000.\n   - **Row 2**: South Melbourne vs St Kilda at Lake Oval with a crowd of 19000.\n     - This exceeds 7000.\n   - **Row 3**: Hawthorn vs Footscray at Glenferrie Oval with a crowd of 9000.\n     - This exceeds 7000.\n   - **Row 4**: Richmond vs Collingwood at Punt Road Oval with a crowd of 25000.\n     - This exceeds 7000.\n   - **Row 5**: Essendon vs Carlton at Windy Hill with a crowd of 18000.\n     - This exceeds 7000.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since rows 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 have more than 7000 spectators, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells are from rows with a crowd greater than 7000.\n   - These are found in column \"crowd\" for rows 1 through 5.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
