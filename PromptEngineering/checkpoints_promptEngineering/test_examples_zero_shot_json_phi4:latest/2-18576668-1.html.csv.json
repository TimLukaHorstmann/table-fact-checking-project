This \"invitational\" event took place in Los Angeles.\n\nLet's analyze the table data step by step:\n\n- **Identify all \"invitational\" events:**\n\n  We need to find any rows where the \"event type\" column contains the value \"invitational\". In this table, we have one such entry:\n  \n  - Row index 16 has an event of type \"invitational\".\n\n- **Check if it's in the 2005 season:**\n\n  For row index 16, we check the \"season\" column. It lists \"2005\", matching our requirement for the season.\n\n- **Verify the location is Los Angeles:**\n\n  In the same row (index 16), the \"location\" column shows \"los angeles\". This matches the specified location in the claim.\n\n- **Ensure it's the only \"invitational\" event in that season and location:**\n\n  Since there is only one entry for an \"invitational\" type in the entire table, and it meets both the season and location criteria, this confirms the uniqueness condition in the claim.\n\nBased on these checks, all conditions of the claim are satisfied.

Instead, seasons from \"1997-98\" to \"2011\" are present.\n   - It mentions \"the last 2 games in season 5.\"\n   - The events should be held in Los Angeles and London.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Dataset:**\n   - Review each entry's 'season' to determine if there is a 'season 5.'

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"there be 10 event in 2011\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the data within the table for events occurring in the year 2011.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The relevant column for this check is the \"season\" and possibly \"date\" as these columns provide information about when the events took place.\n\n2. **Filter Data by Year**:\n   - We need to find rows where the \"season\" contains \"2011\".\n   - Additionally, we should verify that none of the event dates fall outside 2011 if there are any ambiguities in the seasons.\n\n3. **Count Events for 2011**: \n   - Count the number of events listed under the year 2011 by checking all rows where either the season is \"2011\" or the date falls within 2011.\n\n### Examination:\n\n- Look through each row to see if \"season\" contains \"2011\".\n- The relevant row that directly matches this criteria is:\n  - Row with index `17`: \n    - Season: \"2011\"\n    - Event type: \"pro tour\"\n    - Location: \"nagoya\"\n    - Format: \"block constructed and booster draft\"\n    - Date: \"10 - 12 june 2011\"\n    - Rank: 5\n\n- No other rows indicate the year 2011 in either the season or date fields.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states there are \"10 event[s] in 2011\". However, we found only one event for 2011. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nWe identified that the relevant row index and column names to verify this claim were:\n- Row index `17` with column name \"season\"\n- Additionally, column \"date\" could be considered if verifying within context but wasn't necessary here as only one row was marked for 2011.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"season\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
