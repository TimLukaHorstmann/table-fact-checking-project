    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Don Freeland's average laps per year over the course of 8 years is true or false, we need to calculate the average number of laps completed across all the years provided in the table.\n\nThe relevant column for this calculation is \"laps,\" as it contains the data on how many laps were completed each year. We will ignore other columns like \"year,\" \"start,\" \"qual,\" \"rank,\" and \"finish\" since they are not needed to calculate the average number of laps per year.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Extract Lap Data:** Extract the number of laps from each row in the table for all 8 years.\n   - Year 1953: 76 laps\n   - Year 1954: 200 laps\n   - Year 1955: 178 laps\n   - Year 1956: 200 laps\n   - Year 1957: 192 laps\n   - Year 1958: 200 laps\n   - Year 1959: 136 laps\n   - Year 1960: 129 laps\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Laps:** Add up all the laps from each year.\n   \\[\n   76 + 200 + 178 + 200 + 192 + 200 + 136 + 129 = 1311\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Average Laps per Year:** Divide the total number of laps by the number of years (8).\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1311}{8} = 163.875\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compare with Claimed Average:** The calculated average is 163.875 laps per year, which matches the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"Don Freeland average 163.875 lap per year over the course of 8 years\" is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells from the table for this calculation:\n\n- All rows (0 to 7) in the column named \"laps.\"\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
