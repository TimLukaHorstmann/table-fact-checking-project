    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify the information provided in the claim against the data from the table.\n\nThe claim states:\n- \"week 8 on november 13 , 1949 have a w result with a score of 65 - 20\"\n\nLet's break down each part of this claim and match it against the relevant cells in the table:\n\n1. **Week**: The claim refers to week 8. We need to find row 7 (index 7) because arrays are zero-indexed.\n\n2. **Date**: The claim specifies \"november 13, 1949\". In row 7 of our data, we can see that the date is indeed \"November 13, 1949\".\n\n3. **Result**: The claim states that the result should be a win (\"w\"). In row 7, the result is listed as \"w 65 - 20\", indicating a win.\n\n4. **Score**: The claim includes a score of \"65 - 20\". This matches exactly with the score given in row 7 for that game.\n\nBased on this examination:\n- Week: Matches (week 8)\n- Date: Matches (\"November 13, 1949\")\n- Result: Matches (win, indicated by \"w\")\n- Score: Matches (\"65 - 20\")\n\nAll conditions of the claim are satisfied with the data in row index 7. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are found in row index 7 and include:\n- \"week\"\n- \"date\"\n- \"result\"\n\nThus, the JSON response will be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify specific parts of it against the provided table:\n\n1. **Claim Details**:\n   - The result is \"w 65 - 20\".\n   - This occurred after week 9 on November 13, 1949.\n\n2. **Verification Steps**:\n   - Identify the row in the table corresponding to November 13, 1949.\n   - Check if this date is indeed after week 9.\n   - Verify that the result for this date matches \"w 65 - 20\".\n\n3. **Table Analysis**:\n   - Locate the row with the date \"november 13 , 1949\".\n   - This corresponds to row index 7 in the data array.\n   - Check the \"week\" column for this row: it should be after week 9, which means it should be at least week 10 or later. Here, it is week 8.\n   - Check the \"result\" column for this row: it shows \"w 65 - 20\".\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The date November 13, 1949, corresponds to week 8, not after week 9 as claimed.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false because the condition of occurring \"after week 9\" is not met.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - Row index 7, column \"week\": This confirms it's week 8.\n   - Row index 7, column \"date\": Confirms the date as November 13, 1949.\n   - Row index 7, column \"result\": Confirms the result as \"w 65 - 20\".\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.
