    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to analyze two main points from the table:\n\n1. **First Grand Slam Tournament Match Win:**\n   - The player's performance in grand slam tournaments is recorded for each year from 2006 to 2012.\n   - For \"Australian Open\": \n     - Wins first match (moved past Round of 64) in 2010 (\"2r\").\n   - For \"French Open\":\n     - Wins first two matches (moved past Round of 64 and Round of 32) in 2009 (\"2r\") and continues to the third round (\"3r\") in 2010.\n   - For \"Wimbledon\":\n     - Qualifies for the main draw in 2009, but loses in the first round (\"1r\") that year. No wins until later years.\n   - For \"US Open\":\n     - First match win (moved past Round of 64) in 2008 (\"lq\" indicating qualification, thus no loss), and advances to second round (\"2r\") in 2010.\n\n   The earliest grand slam tournament match win is at the Australian Open in 2010.\n\n2. **First Premier Mandatory Match Win:**\n   - The performance in premier mandatory tournaments (Indian Wells and Miami) for each year from 2006 to 2012:\n   - For \"Indian Wells\":\n     - First round win (\"2r\") occurs in 2010.\n   - For \"Miami\":\n     - First round win (\"3r\") also occurs in 2010.\n\n   The earliest match win at a premier mandatory tournament is in Indian Wells or Miami, both occurring in 2010.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Both the first grand slam tournament match win and the first premier mandatory match win occur in 2010. \n- Therefore, the claim that \"poloma's first premier mandatory match win came after her first grand slam tournament match win\" is FALSE because they occurred simultaneously, not sequentially with a gap.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- For Grand Slam Tournaments:\n  - Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open in 2010.\n- For Premier Mandatory Matches (Indian Wells and Miami):\n  - Both tournaments' records for the year 2010.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Australian Open\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"French Open\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Wimbledon\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"US Open\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Indian Wells\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Miami\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding Poloma's tennis performance between the years 2009 and 2011, we need to examine two specific aspects from the provided table:\n\n1. **Total Match Wins for Each Year**: \n   - This involves calculating the sum of match wins across all tournaments (including both Grand Slam Tournaments and Premier Mandatory events) for each year.\n   \n2. **Grand Slam Match Wins Specifically**:\n   - We need to focus on the \"win-loss\" records specifically from the Grand Slam Tournaments section for these years.\n\nLet's break down the relevant parts of the table:\n\n### Total Matches Won Each Year\n\n- **2009**: \n  - From the row with headers: `[\"grand slam tournaments\", \"australian open\", \"french open\", \"wimbledon\", \"us open\"]`, the win-loss for 2009 is `1 - 2`.\n  - From the row with headers: `[\"premier mandatory\", \"indian wells\", \"miami\", \"beijing\"]`, the win-loss for 2009 is `0 - 0`.\n  - Total wins in 2009 = \\(1 + 0 = 1\\).\n\n- **2011**:\n  - From the row with headers: `[\"grand slam tournaments\", \"australian open\", \"french open\", \"wimbledon\", \"us open\"]`, the win-loss for 2011 is `3 - 4`.\n  - From the row with headers: `[\"premier mandatory\", \"indian wells\", \"miami\", \"beijing\"]`, the win-loss for 2011 is `1 - 3`.\n  - Total wins in 2011 = \\(3 + 1 = 4\\).\n\n### Grand Slam Matches Won Each Year\n\n- **2009**: \n  - Win-loss from `[\"grand slam tournaments\", \"australian open\", \"french open\", \"wimbledon\", \"us open\"]` is `1 - 2`.\n  - Total wins at Grand Slams in 2009 = \\(1\\).\n\n- **2011**:\n  - Win-loss from `[\"grand slam tournaments\", \"australian open\", \"french open\", \"wimbledon\", \"us open\"]` is `3 - 4`.\n  - Total wins at Grand Slams in 2011 = \\(3\\).\n\n### Evaluation of the Claim\n\n- **Most Total Matches Won**: The claim states that 2009 was the year Poloma had the most total match wins. From our calculation, Poloma won 1 total match in 2009 and 4 total matches in 2011. Hence, this part of the claim is false.\n\n- **Most Grand Slam Matches Won**: The claim also states that 2011 was the year with the most Grand Slam match wins. Our analysis shows that Poloma won 3 Grand Slam matches in 2011 compared to only 1 in 2009. This part of the claim is true.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince one condition (most total match wins) is false, the entire claim is false. The relevant cells are those showing the win-loss records for each year across all tournaments and specifically for Grand Slam Tournaments.\n\nHere's the JSON representation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"2009\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"2011\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"2009\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"2011\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Identify Polona's year-end ranking in 2008.\n2. Identify Polona's year-end ranking in 2011.\n3. Calculate the difference between these rankings.\n4. Check if the difference is exactly 12 spots.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Year-end ranking for 2008: 243\n- Year-end ranking for 2011: 36\n\nCalculate the difference:\n- Difference = 243 (2008) - 36 (2011) = 207\n\nThe claim states that Polona was ranked 12 spots higher in 2008 than in 2011. However, our calculation shows a difference of 207 spots.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant Cells:\n- The relevant row index for \"year end ranking\" is 19.\n- The relevant column names are the specific years: \"2008\" and \"2011\".\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"2008\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"2011\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine Polona's performance in Grand Slam tournaments for each year from 2006 to 2012 and identify which years have the most matches won.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We are interested in the match results for each Grand Slam tournament (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open) across the specified years.\n   - The \"win-loss\" record for each year is crucial to ascertain the total number of matches won during that year.\n\n2. **Analyze Each Year:**\n   - **2006 and 2007**: Polona has a win-loss record of \"0-0\", indicating no Grand Slam match wins in these years.\n   - **2008**: The win-loss record is \"1-2\". This means she won 1 Grand Slam match in 2008.\n   - **2009**: The win-loss record is \"1-2\", meaning she also won 1 Grand Slam match in 2009.\n   - **2010**: The win-loss record is \"3-4\", showing that she won 3 Grand Slam matches in 2010.\n   - **2011**: The win-loss record for Grand Slam tournaments is \"3-4\", indicating 3 wins in 2011.\n   - **2012**: The win-loss record is \"0-4\", meaning no Grand Slam match wins in this year.\n\n3. **Compare the Number of Wins:**\n   - In 2008 and 2011, Polona won 1 and 3 matches respectively for each of these years at the Grand Slam tournaments.\n   - Comparing all the years, 2010 and 2011 have the highest number of wins (3 matches).\n\n4. **Conclusion on the Claim:**\n   - The claim is that 2008 and 2011 are the years Polona had the most Grand Slam match wins. However, both these years do not have the maximum number of wins; rather, it's 2010 and 2011.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n- The rows corresponding to each year's \"win-loss\" record under the Grand Slam tournaments are relevant to this analysis.\n- Specifically, we check the win-loss records in the columns named after each Grand Slam tournament for years 2008 and 2011.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Australian Open\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"French Open\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Wimbledon\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"US Open\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Australian Open\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"French Open\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Wimbledon\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"US Open\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
