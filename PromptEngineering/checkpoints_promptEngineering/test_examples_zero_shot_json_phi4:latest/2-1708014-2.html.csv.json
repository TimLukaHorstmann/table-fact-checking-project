    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to analyze the table and check for a specific condition: when there is a \"starts\" value of 4 and a \"position\" of \"46th\", whether the \"poles\" value is indeed 0.\n\nHere's how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:** \n   - \"starts\"\n   - \"position\"\n   - \"poles\"\n\n2. **Iterate Through Each Row:**\n   - Check if both conditions of \"starts = 4\" and \"position = '46th'\" are met.\n   - If they are, verify that the corresponding \"poles\" value is 0.\n\n3. **Examine the Data:**\n\n   Let's go through each row:\n\n   - **Row 0:** \n     - starts = 1, position = \"133rd\", poles = 0 (Does not meet conditions)\n   \n   - **Row 1:** \n     - starts = 4, position = \"46th\", poles = 0 (Meets conditions, check poles: 0)\n\n   - **Row 2 to Row 15:** \n     - None of these rows have both starts = 4 and position = \"46th\".\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Only Row 1 satisfies the condition where \"starts\" is 4 and \"position\" is \"46th\".\n   - In this row, \"poles\" is indeed 0.\n\nSince the conditions of the claim are fully supported by the data in Row 1, the answer to the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"starts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"poles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
