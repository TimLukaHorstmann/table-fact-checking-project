Locate the row with the model \"clps306\" in the data:\n   - The relevant row is: `[\"clps306\", \"no\", \"yes\", \"no\", \"yes\"]`.\n\n2. Identify the column named \"natural wood keyboard\":\n   - This column corresponds to the third position in each row (0-indexed).\n\n3. Check the value for the model \"clps306\" under the \"natural wood keyboard\" column:\n   - The value is \"no,\" indicating that clps306 does not have a natural wood keyboard.\n\nGiven this information, the claim is supported because the model \"clps306\" indeed does not feature a natural wood keyboard.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the model cvp501 hammer grade,\" we need to interpret it correctly and check against the given table.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The phrase \"hammer grade\" typically refers to a feature related to piano action, particularly whether a piano has a graded hammer mechanism. In this context:\n   - \"Graded hammer (non GH3)\" corresponds to traditional graded hammer mechanisms.\n   - \"Graded hammer three (GH3)\" represents modern graded hammer mechanisms.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Data**: The claim is about the model \"cvp501\" and its association with a \"hammer grade.\" Therefore, we need to check if this model has either of the \"graded hammer\" features.\n\n3. **Locating the Model in the Table**:\n   - Find the row where the model name is \"cvp501.\"\n\n4. **Checking for Graded Hammer Features**:\n   - Look at the columns \"graded hammer (non gh3)\" and \"graded hammer three (gh3)\" for this model.\n\n5. **Evaluating the Claim**:\n   - If either of these columns has a value of \"yes\" for the model \"cvp501,\" then the claim is true.\n   - If both are \"no,\" the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the table:\n\n- The row with the model \"cvp501\" corresponds to:\n  ```json\n  [\n    \"cvp501\",\n    \"yes\",\n    \"no\",\n    \"no\",\n    \"no\"\n  ]\n  ```\n\n- For the columns relevant to our claim:\n  - \"graded hammer (non gh3)\" is \"yes.\"\n  - \"graded hammer three (gh3)\" is \"no.\"\n\nSince the model \"cvp501\" has a traditional graded hammer (\"graded hammer (non gh3)\"), it satisfies the condition of having a \"hammer grade.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row index for \"cvp501\" is 14.\n- Columns checked: \"graded hammer (non gh3)\" and \"graded hammer three (gh3).\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"graded hammer (non gh3)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"graded hammer three (gh3)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
