Therefore, we need to infer or assume his involvement based on external knowledge (which we won't do here) since the task relies solely on this table.\n\n4. **Checking Entries**:\n   - For each year, check if there is an Alfa Romeo involved and see which teams raced with it.\n   - In 1982, neither of the two entries (\"arrows racing team\" using \"arrows a4\" and \"arrows a5\") involves an Alfa Romeo.
