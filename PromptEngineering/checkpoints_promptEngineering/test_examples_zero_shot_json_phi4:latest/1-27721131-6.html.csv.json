    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify the following parts of the claim against the provided table:\n\n1. The date mentioned in the claim is \"November 12th.\"\n2. John Wall should have led both teams in assists on that date.\n3. John Wall should have made exactly 11 assists.\n\nLet's break this down step-by-step using the data from the table:\n\n- **Finding the Relevant Row:**\n  - We need to find the row corresponding to \"November 12th.\" From the table, we see:\n    ```json\n    [\n      7,\n      \"november 12\",\n      \"charlotte\",\n      \"l 85 - 93 (ot)\",\n      \"andray blatche (22)\",\n      \"andray blatche (9)\",\n      \"john wall (11)\",\n      \"verizon center 14855\",\n      \"2 - 5\"\n    ]\n    ```\n  - This row indicates that on November 12, John Wall had 11 assists.\n\n- **Verifying the Assist Count:**\n  - The \"high assists\" column for this game shows \"john wall (11),\" confirming that he made 11 assists.\n\n- **Checking if John Wall Led Both Teams in Assists:**\n  - We need to check the \"high assists\" data for both teams:\n    - For the team playing at Verizon Center (presumably Washington Wizards based on context), John Wall had 11 assists.\n    - For the opposing team, Charlotte, we look at the \"high assists\" column. The data shows \"john wall (11)\" which means it was recorded for the home team. There is no mention of any player from the Charlotte Hornets leading in assists in this row.\n\nSince there's no indication that any Charlotte player had more than 11 assists, John Wall indeed led both teams in assists on November 12th with 11 assists.\n\nThus, all conditions of the claim are met:\n\n- The date matches.\n- John Wall did lead both teams in assists.\n- He made exactly 11 assists.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. Here's the relevant JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim about the team's record after losing to Atlanta on November 25, we need to check two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. Confirm the game result against Atlanta on November 25 was a loss.\n2. Verify that the team's record immediately following this game was \"5 - 9\".\n\nLet's examine the relevant rows and columns in the JSON data provided:\n\n- **Game Details for Atlanta (November 25):**\n  - The row corresponding to the game on November 25 lists:\n    - `game`: 14\n    - `date`: \"november 25\"\n    - `team`: \"atlanta\"\n    - `score`: \"l 96 - 116 (ot)\"\n    - This confirms that the team lost this game.\n\n- **Record After Losing to Atlanta:**\n  - The same row for November 25 provides:\n    - `record`: \"5 - 9\"\n  - Additionally, we need to ensure that the next game's record reflects an increment in losses from this point. Checking the subsequent row (November 27 against Orlando):\n    - For the game on November 27:\n      - `game`: 15\n      - `record`: \"5 - 10\"\n    - This confirms that after losing to Atlanta, the team's next loss incremented their record correctly.\n\nThus, both conditions in the claim are satisfied: the team lost to Atlanta, and their record dropped to \"5 - 9\" immediately following this game.\n\nThe relevant cells from the JSON data that support these findings are:\n\n- Row index 13 (November 25 against Atlanta) for:\n  - `score` (indicating a loss)\n  - `record` (showing \"5 - 9\")\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. Here's the corresponding JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
