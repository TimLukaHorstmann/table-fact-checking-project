Identify Larry Mize's entry in the data:\n   - From the \"data\" array, find the row where \"player\" equals \"larry mize\". This corresponds to row index 8.\n   \n2. Verify the relevant information for this player:\n   - Check the \"country\" column at row index 8 to confirm Larry Mize's nationality or team affiliation.\n\n3. Analyze the claim against the table:\n   - The claim states that Larry Mize played for the United States.\n   - In the table, at row index 8 under the \"country\" column, it is listed as \"united states\".\n\nSince the information from the table supports the claim that Larry Mize played for the United States, the claim is true.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Therefore, there is no record of a win in 1976 for him.\n\n4. **Verify the Total Score:**\n   - Even if he had won in 1976, the claim states his total would be 154. However, according to the table, his recorded total score is 150, not 154.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim does not hold because Tom Watson did not win in 1976 and his total score for wins listed is not 154 but 150.\n   - Therefore, the statement is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to check are those that pertain to Tom Watson's name, years won, and total score.
