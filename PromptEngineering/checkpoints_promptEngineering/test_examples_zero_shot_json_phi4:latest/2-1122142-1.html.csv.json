    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim about Robert Manzon's performance in a race based on the provided table, we need to analyze each component of the claim:\n\n1. **\"Robert Manzon who have 88 lap with a Maserati\":**\n   - We look for entries related to \"Robert manzon\".\n   - According to the data:\n     - Row index 10: Robert Manzon has completed 94 laps, not 88.\n     - No entry shows Robert Manzon completing exactly 88 laps.\n\n2. **\"have average 22 grid\":**\n   - The claim suggests that Robert Manzon's starting grid position should average out to 22.\n   - Again, examining the relevant data for \"Robert manzon\":\n     - Row index 10: Starting grid is 18 (not 22), and he completed 94 laps.\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n- The first part of the claim about completing 88 laps with a Maserati is incorrect as per the table.\n- The second part regarding an average starting grid position of 22 cannot be verified for Robert Manzon since his actual starting grid was 18.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are not supported by the data, the entire claim is false. Now, let's identify the relevant cells used to verify this:\n\n- For laps:\n  - Row index 10: \"laps\" column (Robert Manzon completed 94 laps).\n\n- For grid position:\n  - Row index 10: \"grid\" column (Starting grid was 18 for Robert Manzon).\n\nThus, the JSON answer with these relevant cells is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
