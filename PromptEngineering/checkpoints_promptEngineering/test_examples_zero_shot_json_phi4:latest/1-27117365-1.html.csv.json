Check if those episodes have exactly 7.7 million US viewers.\n\nLet's go through the table step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Find Episodes Written by Chris Fedak & Matt Miller\n\nWe will look at the \"written by\" column to find any entries matching \"Chris Fedak & Matt Miller.\"\n\n- **Row 0**: The episode titled \"Chuck versus the pink slip\" is written by Chris Fedak & Matt Miller.\n- No other rows have this exact combination of writers.\n\n### Step 2: Check Viewership for the Identified Episode\n\nNow, we need to check the \"US viewers (million)\" column for the row where Chris Fedak & Matt Miller are listed as writers.\n\n- **Row 0**: The US viewers count is 7.7 million.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe conditions of the claim are fully satisfied:\n\n- There is an episode written by Chris Fedak & Matt Miller.\n- This episode has exactly 7.7 million US viewers.\n\nThus, the claim is true.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"written by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (million)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The number of US viewers in millions for that specific episode.\n\nThe relevant column names are \"original air date\" and \"us viewers (million)\" as these directly address the conditions mentioned in the claim.\n\nFirstly, we check the \"original air date\" to identify any episodes aired on March 15, 2010. By examining each entry under this column, we find that one episode was indeed aired on March 15, 2010:\n\n- Row index: 45\n- Original Air Date: March 15, 2010\n\nNext, we check the number of US viewers for this particular episode. We need to verify if it matches the claimed 5.85 million viewers.\n\nFrom the same row (index 45) in the \"us viewers (million)\" column:\n\n- Us Viewers (Million): 5.85\n\nBoth conditions from the claim are satisfied: the original air date is March 15, 2010, and the number of US viewers for that episode is 5.85 million.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true based on the data provided in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 45, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 45, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (million)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The title of the 10th episode in the season.\n2. Whether \"Chuck versus the Tic Tac\" matches this title.\n\nHere are the steps to verify the claim:\n\n- **Identify the relevant column**: We need to look at the \"no in season\" and \"title\" columns to identify which episodes correspond to each sequence number within a season.\n\n- **Find the 10th episode**:\n  - Look for the row where \"no in season\" is 10. This will give us the correct position of the episode in the current season.\n  \n- **Check the title**:\n  - Once we find the row with \"no in season\" as 10, check if the corresponding \"title\" column matches \"Chuck versus the Tic Tac\".\n\nLet's analyze:\n\n1. From the table data provided:\n   - The row with \"no in season\" equal to 10 is: \n     ```json\n     [\n       45,\n       10,\n       \"chuck versus the tic tac\",\n       \"patrick norris\",\n       \"rafe judkins & lauren lefranc\",\n       \"march 15 , 2010\",\n       \"3x5810\",\n       5.85\n     ]\n     ```\n\n2. The title for this row is indeed \"chuck versus the tic tac\".\n\nSince both conditions (being the 10th episode in the season and having the title \"Chuck versus the Tic Tac\") are satisfied, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON object with relevant information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
