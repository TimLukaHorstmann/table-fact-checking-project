    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about June 13's record is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data in the provided table.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim states \"the record for june 13 be under 29 - 32.\" This implies that on June 13, the team's record should be something less than a win-loss combination of 29 wins and 32 losses.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - We need to locate the row corresponding to June 13.\n   - Within this row, we need to examine the \"record\" column because it directly pertains to the team's win-loss record on that date.\n\n3. **Examine the Table for June 13**:\n   - The table entry for June 13 is:\n     ```json\n     [\n       \"june 13\",\n       \"phillies\",\n       \"4 - 3\",\n       \"spoljaric (0 - 3)\",\n       26799,\n       \"29 - 32\"\n     ]\n     ```\n   - The \"record\" column for this date shows \"29 - 32.\"\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - According to the claim, the record should be under 29 - 32.\n   - A record of \"under 29 - 32\" would mean any combination where wins are less than 29 or losses are more than 32 (e.g., 28-32, 29-33, etc.).\n   - The actual record is exactly 29 - 32.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the record on June 13 is precisely 29 - 32 and not under it, the claim is false.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cell for verifying this claim is in row index 10 (considering zero-based indexing) of the \"record\" column.\n\nThe final JSON output based on this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
