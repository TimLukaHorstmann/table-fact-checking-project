    "resp": "To evaluate the claim that \"Joonas Nattinen is the only player from Finland shown in the table,\" we need to verify two main aspects:\n\n1. Confirm Joonas Nattinen's nationality as Finnish.\n2. Check if there are any other players listed with a nationality of Finland.\n\nLet's proceed step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Verify Joonas Nattinen's Details\n\n- **Row Index**: According to the table, Joonas Nattinen is at row index 64.\n- **Nationality Column**: The column \"nationality\" shows that his nationality is Finland.\n\nFrom this information, we can confirm:\n- Relevant cell for verifying Joonas Nattinen's Finnish nationality: `{\"row_index\": 64, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"}`\n\n### Step 2: Check for Other Players from Finland\n\nTo verify if he is the only player from Finland, we need to examine the \"nationality\" column for all rows and see if any other entry lists Finland.\n\n- **Iterate through the data**:\n  - For each row (excluding Joonas Nattinen's row at index 64), check the value in the \"nationality\" column.\n  - Look specifically for entries where the nationality is Finland.\n\nUpon reviewing all rows:\n\n1. Row indices and their nationalities:\n   - Indices 0 to 63, and 65 to 91 do not list Finland as the nationality.\n2. Joonas Nattinen at row index 64 is indeed Finnish.\n\nSince no other players are listed with a nationality of Finland, the claim that he is the only player from Finland in this table is verified as true.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying both aspects of the claim include:\n- Joonas Nattinen's nationality: `{\"row_index\": 64, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"}`\n- All other rows' nationalities to ensure no other Finnish players are listed. However, since we're only interested in those that confirm or refute the uniqueness, checking every row is implicit but not individually necessary beyond confirming non-Finnish entries.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 64, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Taylor Beck be pick 2 place before Ryan Howse,\" we need to verify two parts:\n\n1. **Check if Taylor Beck is picked at pick number 70.**\n2. **Ensure Ryan Howse is picked after Taylor Beck.**\n\nWe'll analyze the data from the table to confirm these conditions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation\n\n1. **Locate Taylor Beck:**\n   - We search for \"Taylor Beck\" in the \"player\" column.\n   - From the table, we find that Taylor Beck has a pick number of 70 (row index 9).\n\n2. **Check Pick Number Condition:**\n   - The claim states that Taylor Beck should be picked at pick number 2. However, he is actually picked at pick number 70.\n\n3. **Locate Ryan Howse:**\n   - We search for \"Ryan Howse\" in the \"player\" column.\n   - From the table, we find that Ryan Howse has a pick number of 74 (row index 13).\n\n4. **Check Order Condition:**\n   - Taylor Beck is picked at 70, and Ryan Howse is picked at 74.\n   - Therefore, Taylor Beck is indeed picked before Ryan Howse.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The condition that Taylor Beck should be picked at pick number 2 is not met. He is picked at 70 instead.\n- Although he is picked before Ryan Howse, the specific condition regarding pick number 2 is false.\n\nThus, the claim as a whole is **FALSE** because Taylor Beck is not picked at pick number 2.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- The cell for Taylor Beck's pick number (row index 9).\n- The cell for Ryan Howse's pick number (row index 13).\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"Daniel Delisle be the last United States player chosen among those list\" is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: Focus on two columns: \"player\" and \"nationality\". We are particularly interested in players with the nationality \"united states\".\n\n2. **Extract Data for United States Players**:\n   - Go through each row in the data section of the table.\n   - Extract rows where the \"nationality\" is \"united states\".\n   - Note down the corresponding \"pick\" numbers and player names.\n\n3. **Verify the Order**: Check if Daniel Delisle appears last among these United States players based on their pick number.\n\n4. **Determine Truth of Claim**:\n   - If Daniel Delisle has the highest pick number compared to other United States players, then the claim is true.\n   - Otherwise, it is false.\n\nLet's extract and analyze the relevant data:\n\n- **Row 2**: Ben Hanowski (Pick 63)\n- **Row 6**: Josh Birkholz (Pick 67)\n- **Row 10**: Troy Hesketh (Pick 71)\n- **Row 18**: Ryan Bourque (Pick 80)\n- **Row 28**: Daniel Delisle (Pick 89)\n\nFrom the extracted data, we see that:\n- The highest pick number among United States players is 89 for Daniel Delisle.\n\nTherefore, Daniel Delisle is indeed the last United States player chosen in this list.\n\nThe relevant cells are those containing information about the \"pick\" and \"nationality\" of United States players.
