In the table, there is a row:\n   - Row Index: 5\n   - Team 1: \"triumph\"\n   - Team 2: \"telindus oostende\"\n\n2. **Aggregate score**: The claim seems to refer to an aggregate result where \"triumph\" lost by a specific difference. Let's look at the aggregate score:\n   - Row Index: 5\n   - Aggregate (agg): \"146 - 159\"\n   This indicates \"telindus oostende\" won with a total of 159 points while \"triumph\" scored 146, making the difference 13 points.\n\n3. **Second leg score**: The claim mentions scores of \"68 71\". We need to verify the second leg score:\n   - Row Index: 5\n   - Second Leg: \"68 - 81\"\n   This indicates that in the second leg, \"telindus oostende\" scored 81 and \"triumph\" scored 68. The difference here is 13 points.\n\nThe claim states a specific result of \"by the following of the 68 71\", which seems to refer to the scoreline of the second leg (68 - 81).

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"ask riga be unable to qualify for the final round\" is true or false based on the table provided, we need to understand what it means for a team to qualify for the next round in this context. Typically, in knockout tournaments, a team qualifies if they have more aggregate points (total score over two legs) than their opponent.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Team**: The claim is specifically about \"ask riga\". We will look at the row where \"ask riga\" appears in the table.\n\n2. **Locate 'Ask Riga' Row**:\n   - In this JSON, each sub-array within \"data\" represents a row.\n   - We need to find the array where \"ask riga\" is listed under \"team 1\".\n\n3. **Check Aggregate Score for Ask Riga**:\n   - For the identified row, check the \"agg\" column to see if \"ask riga\" has more points than their opponent (\"cholet\").\n\n4. **Perform Calculations and Comparison**:\n   - The aggregate score is given as \"142 - 137\", with \"ask riga\" having 142 points.\n   - Compare the scores: 142 (Ask Riga) vs. 137 (Cholet).\n   - Since 142 > 137, Ask Riga has more points than Cholet.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the aggregate score comparison, \"ask riga\" qualifies for the next round because they have a higher total score.\n   - Therefore, the claim that \"ask riga be unable to qualify for the final round\" is false.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells are those containing data about Ask Riga's performance: specifically their aggregate score and individual leg scores.\n   - These can be found in the row where \"ask riga\" appears, which corresponds to the 7th sub-array (0-based index is 6).\n\nGiven these steps, we determine the claim is false. The relevant cells for verifying this are:\n\n- Row with index 6 (\"Ask Riga\")\n- Columns: \"agg\", \"team 1\", \"team 2\", \"1st leg\", and \"2nd leg\"\n\nNow, let's format this conclusion into the requested JSON object.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
