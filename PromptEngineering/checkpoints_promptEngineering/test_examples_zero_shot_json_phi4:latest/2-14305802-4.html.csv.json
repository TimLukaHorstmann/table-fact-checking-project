However, the consistent pattern of wins and losses suggests this is the main team being tracked through its games.\n\n- **Opponent Team Check for Game Number 22**:\n  - According to the table's `data`, game number 22 lists the opponent as \"Los Angeles Kings\" (see the first row in `data`), not the Colorado Rockies.\n\n- **Outcome of Game 22**:\n  - In the first entry (`row_index = 0`) for game 22, the score is \"4 - 2\". This indicates a win for Philadelphia Flyers since their score (4) is greater than that of Los Angeles Kings (2).\n\nGiven these verifications:\n\n- The opponent team does not match the claim.

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"the 1977-78 Philadelphia Flyer win by 3 points against the Boston Bruins,\" we need to verify several conditions against the provided table:\n\n1. **Team Names**: The claim mentions two teams: the Philadelphia Flyers and the Boston Bruins.\n2. **Outcome**: It specifies a win for the Philadelphia Flyers with a score difference of 3 points (or goals in hockey context).\n3. **Date/Season**: Although not explicitly stated, it's implied that this event took place during the 1977-78 season.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate these conditions step-by-step using the data:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Relevant Games\nWe need to find a game involving the Philadelphia Flyers and the Boston Bruins from the table. The table does not directly mention \"Philadelphia Flyers\" but lists games for other teams, so we focus on identifying games against the Boston Bruins.\n\n- **Row 7**: Game against Boston Bruins with score \"6 - 4\".\n- **Row 11**: Game against Boston Bruins with score \"1 - 6\".\n\n### Step 2: Determine Game Outcomes\nFor each identified game involving the Boston Bruins, check if it was a win for the Philadelphia Flyers and whether the score difference was exactly 3.\n\n- **Row 7**:\n  - Score: \"6 - 4\" (Philadelphia Flyers win by 2 points)\n  - Record updated to \"20 - 4 - 4\", indicating a win.\n  \n- **Row 11**:\n  - Score: \"1 - 6\" (Boston Bruins win, Philadelphia Flyers lose)\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\nThe game in Row 7 was won by the Philadelphia Flyers but with a score difference of 2 points, not 3. The game in Row 11 was a loss for the Philadelphia Flyers.\n\nSince neither game matches all conditions of the claim (winning against the Boston Bruins by exactly 3 points), the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are those from rows where the Boston Bruins were opponents:\n\n- **Row 7**: Columns \"opponent\", \"score\", and \"record\".\n- **Row 11**: Columns \"opponent\" and \"score\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
