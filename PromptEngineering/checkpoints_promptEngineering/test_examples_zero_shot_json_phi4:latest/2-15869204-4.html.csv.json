This indicates that there has been a game where a player achieved more than 13 rebounds.\n\nSince the highest rebound total recorded is 16, and not 13 as claimed, the statement is false. We need to identify all instances where rebounds are mentioned in order to provide relevant cells:\n\n- Row 0 (index: 0) with \"16\" rebounds.\n- Rows 2, 3, and others up to row 15 are less than or equal to 13, but do not affect the claim as they don't exceed it.\n\nThus, we conclude that the claim is false.
