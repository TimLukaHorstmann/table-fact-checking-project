    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant information provided in the table about clubs and their associated stadiums.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n- The claim states: \"al kuwait sport club stadium have the club kazma sport club.\"\n\nThis can be broken down into two main conditions that must both hold true for the claim to be valid:\n1. The \"club\" named \"kazma sporting club\" should be associated with the \"stadium\" named \"al kuwait sports club stadium.\"\n2. We need to check if any row in the table lists \"kazma sporting club\" under \"stadium\" as \"al kuwait sports club stadium.\"\n\n### Checking the Table:\n- **Column Names:** \n  - The relevant columns for this claim are \"club\" and \"stadium\".\n  \n- **Data Inspection:**\n  - For each row, we need to check if there is a match where:\n    - The \"club\" column contains \"kazma sporting club.\"\n    - The \"stadium\" column contains \"al kuwait sports club stadium.\"\n\nLet's examine the rows:\n\n1. Row 0: \n   - Club: \"kazma sporting club\"\n   - Stadium: \"al - sadaqua walsalam stadium\"\n\n2. Row 3:\n   - Club: \"kuwait\"\n   - Stadium: \"al kuwait sports club stadium\"\n\n3. Other rows do not match both conditions.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- In row 0, the club is indeed \"kazma sporting club,\" but its associated stadium is \"al - sadaqua walsalam stadium,\" not \"al kuwait sports club stadium.\"\n- There is no row where \"kazma sporting club\" matches with \"al kuwait sports club stadium.\"\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because there is no instance in the table that supports both conditions of the claim.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nTo verify this, we need to inspect the following cells:\n\n1.
