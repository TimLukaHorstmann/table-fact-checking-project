    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"D Beadman be the jockey at Rosehill and the weight be 57.5 kg,\" we need to verify two conditions using relevant data from the table:\n\n1. D Beadman must be the jockey in races held at the venue \"Rosehill.\"\n2. The weight for those specific races must be 57.5 kg.\n\nWe'll go through the rows of the table and check each race where the venue is \"Rosehill\" to see if both conditions are satisfied:\n\n- **Row Index 0**: \n  - Venue: \"rosehill\"\n  - Jockey: \"d beadman\"\n  - Weight (kg): 57.5\n  - This row satisfies both conditions.\n\n- **Row Index 11**:\n  - Venue: \"rosehill\"\n  - Jockey: \"d beadman\"\n  - Weight (kg): 58.0\n  - The jockey condition is satisfied, but the weight does not match 57.5 kg. Therefore, this row does not fully satisfy both conditions.\n\nFrom our examination:\n- Row Index 0 satisfies the claim.\n- Row Index 11 partially satisfies the claim due to mismatch in weight.\n\nThe claim states that D Beadman must be the jockey at Rosehill **and** the weight is 57.5 kg for all such instances, which is not true since Row Index 11 fails one condition.\n\nThus, the answer is \"FALSE,\" as there is an instance where the conditions are not met.\n\nThe relevant cells that needed to be checked are:\n\n- Venue: \"rosehill\" (Row Index 0 and 11)\n- Jockey: \"d beadman\" (Row Index 0 and 11)\n- Weight: 57.5 kg (Row Index 0)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"jockey\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"weight (kg)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"jockey\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"weight (kg)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to analyze the specific details provided in the claim and compare them against the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"the time 1:36.30 show 2nd - platinum scissors as the winner.\"\n\nThis implies that for a race with the time of \"1:36.30,\" the horse \"platinum scissors\" should be listed as the winner, but instead, it is shown as the second place.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n1. **Identify the row with the time \"1:36.30\":**\n   - Search through the table's data for an entry where the \"time\" column matches \"1:36.30\".\n\n2. **Check the corresponding \"winner / 2nd\" field:**\n   - For the identified row, verify if the \"winner / 2nd\" column states \"platinum scissors.\"\n\n3. **Determine the actual position of \"platinum scissors\":**\n   - Check whether \"platinum scissors\" is listed as the winner or second place.\n\n### Verification:\n1. From the data provided, locate the entry with time \"1:36.30\":\n   - This occurs in row index 2.\n   \n2. In row index 2, check the \"winner / 2nd\" column:\n   - The value is \"2nd - platinum scissors.\"\n\n3. Confirm the actual result for this race:\n   - The \"result\" column shows \"won,\" indicating that the horse associated with this entry was indeed the winner.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim incorrectly states that \"platinum scissors\" is shown as 2nd when it actually won the race (as indicated by the \"won\" in the result column). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row index 2, \"time\": This cell contains the time \"1:36.30.\"\n- Row index 2, \"winner / 2nd\": This cell contains \"2nd - platinum scissors,\" which contradicts the actual winner status.\n- Row index 2, \"result\": This cell shows \"won,\" confirming that the entry won the race.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner / 2nd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
