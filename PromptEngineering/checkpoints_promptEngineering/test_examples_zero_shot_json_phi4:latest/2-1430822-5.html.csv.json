Therefore, we need to focus on the row where \"season\" is 2008.\n\n2. **Locate the \"Team Champion\" Column:**\n   - We are specifically interested in the value of the \"team champion\" column for the year 2008 because this indicates which team was the champion that season.\n\n3. **Compare with the Claim:**\n   - Check if the entry under the \"team champion\" column for the row corresponding to the year 2008 matches \"barwa international campos team.\"\n\n### Execution:\n- First, locate the row where the \"season\" is 2008. This corresponds to index 3 in a zero-indexed list.\n- Then, examine the value in the \"team champion\" column for this specific row.\n\n### Verification from Table:\n- Row Index: 3\n- Season: 2008\n- Team Champion: \"barwa international campos team\"\n\nThe entry under \"team champion\" for the year 2008 is indeed \"barwa international campos team,\" which matches the claim exactly.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data in the table.
