In this context, it means the transfer fee listed is either `\"free\"` or similar indication (often represented with \"-\").\n\n4. **Evaluate the Transfer Fee for Paulo Costa**:\n   - For Paulo Costa (`row_index` 11 in the table):\n     - The value under `\"transfer fee\"` is `\"free\"`, which matches our condition.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the only player from Portugal listed has a transfer fee of `\"free\"`, the claim is supported by the data for this case.\n   - Therefore, the claim \"por have a free transfer fee\" is true given the data in the table.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells to verify the claim are located at `row_index` 11, `\"nat\"` column and `row_index` 11, `\"transfer fee\"` column.\n\nBased on this analysis, here's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"nat\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
