We need to find the entry with the date \"july 8\".\n\n2. **Score Check**: The claim mentions the score as \"50 - 48\". We must verify that this score is correctly listed for July 8.\n\n3. **Outcome Check**: The claim states it should be a loss (\"l\"). We need to confirm if the game outcome on July 8 is recorded as a loss.\n\n### Verification Against Table:\n\n1. **Date**:\n   - Locate the row with the date \"july 8\".\n   - From the data, this corresponds to row index `2`.\n\n2. **Score**:\n   - Check the score in row index `2`.\n   - The score is listed as \"l 50 - 48\", which matches the claim.\n\n3. **Outcome**:\n   - Verify the game outcome in row index `2`.\n   - It shows a loss (\"l\"), consistent with the claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAll conditions specified in the claim are satisfied by the data at row index `2`.
