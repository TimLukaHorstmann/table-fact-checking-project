The song from the \"dee - lux remix\" should be performed by the same artist.\n2. The song should be from different years.\n\nLet's examine the relevant data:\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Artist: \"pixie lott\"\n  - Year: 2010\n  - Remix: \"dee - lux remix\"\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Artist: \"perry mystique\"\n  - Year: 2010\n  - Remix: \"dee - lux remix\"\n\nNow, let's check the conditions:\n\n1. **Same Artist**: \n   - Row 5 has artist \"pixie lott\".\n   - Row 6 has artist \"perry mystique\".\n   - The artists are different.\n\n2. **Different Years**:\n   - Both rows have the year 2010.\n   - The years are the same.\n\nSince neither condition is met (the artists are different, and the years are the same), the claim is false.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
