Neither condition matches.\n\n    - Row 6: Date is \"24 September 2006\", Outcome is \"winner\". Neither condition matches.\n\n    - Row 7: Date is \"1 October 2006\", Outcome is \"winner\". Neither condition matches.\n\n    - Row 8: Date is \"6 April 2008\", Outcome is \"winner\". Neither condition matches.\n\n    - Row 9: Date is \"5 October 2008\", Outcome is \"winner\". Neither condition matches.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - There is no row in the table where the date is \"12 September 2003\" and the outcome is \"runner-up\".\n   - Thus, the claim does not match any entry in the table.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells for Verification**:\n   - Since no row matches the date \"12 September 2003\", we primarily refer to this column but include all rows for completeness of inspection.\n   - We'll note the first few rows where outcomes were checked, particularly row 1 since it had a close match in terms of outcome.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
