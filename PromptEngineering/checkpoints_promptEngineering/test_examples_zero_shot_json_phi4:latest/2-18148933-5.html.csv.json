    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"david frost be from united state\" is true or false, we need to verify the country associated with David Frost in the provided table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row**: \n   - The claim mentions \"David Frost,\" so we locate his entry in the data.\n   - In the table, David Frost's information appears on row 2 (zero-indexed) under:\n     - `player`: \"david frost\"\n     - `country`: \"south africa\"\n     - Other columns include `place`, `score`, and `to par`.\n\n2. **Verify Claim Against Data**:\n   - The claim states David Frost is from the United States.\n   - According to the table, his country is listed as \"south africa.\"\n   - This directly contradicts the claim.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the data specifies that David Frost is from South Africa and not the United States, the claim is false.\n\n4. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells to verify this information are in row 2 of columns `player` and `country`.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
