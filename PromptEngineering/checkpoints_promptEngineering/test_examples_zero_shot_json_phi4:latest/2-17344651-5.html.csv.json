    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Boston Celtic's largest win margin in December was 23 points\" is true or false based on the provided table data, we need to focus on several aspects:\n\n1. **Identify Games Played by Boston Celtics**: We will check which games involved the team playing at \"BOSTON GARDEN,\" as this implies a home game for the Boston Celtics.\n\n2. **Determine Win Margins for These Games**:\n   - For each game played at BOSTON GARDEN, we calculate the win margin by subtracting the opponent's score from the Boston Celtics' score.\n   - A positive result indicates a win with that specific margin.\n\n3. **Compare All Calculated Win Margins**: After identifying all win margins for games where the Boston Celtics won at home, find the largest one and see if it matches or exceeds 23 points.\n\nLet's analyze each relevant row in detail:\n\n- **Row 1** (Game 15): \n  - Opponent: Cleveland Cavaliers\n  - Score: 110 - 104 (Celtics win by 6 points)\n  \n- **Row 2** (Game 16): \n  - Location: BOSTON GARDEN\n  - Opponent: Cleveland Cavaliers\n  - Score: 122 - 99 (Celtics win by 23 points)\n\n- **Row 4** (Game 18):\n  - Location: BOSTON GARDEN\n  - Opponent: Denver Nuggets\n  - Score: 123 - 107 (Celtics win by 16 points)\n\n- **Row 6** (Game 20): \n  - Location: BOSTON GARDEN\n  - Opponent: Atlanta Hawks\n  - Score: 128 - 127 (Celtics win by 1 point)\n\n- **Row 8** (Game 23):\n  - Location: BOSTON GARDEN\n  - Opponent: Utah Jazz\n  - Score: 117 - 106 (Celtics win by 11 points)\n\n- **Row 10** (Game 27):\n  - Location: BOSTON GARDEN\n  - Opponent: Indiana Pacers\n  - Score: 117 - 107 (Celtics win by 10 points)\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that Boston Celtics' largest win margin at BOSTON GARDEN in December is indeed 23 points (Game 16 against Cleveland Cavaliers).

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two main conditions from the given table:\n\n1. The largest loss margin in December for the Boston Celtics was 25 points.\n2. This loss occurred on December 30.\n\nLet's evaluate each condition using the relevant data from the table:\n\n### Condition 1: Largest Loss Margin\n\nWe need to identify all games where the Boston Celtics lost and calculate their loss margins (opponent score - Boston score):\n\n- **Game 22**: Philadelphia 76ers, Score \"107 - 110\"  \n  Loss margin = 110 - 107 = 3 points\n\n- **Game 26**: Milwaukee Bucks, Score \"92 - 107\"  \n  Loss margin = 107 - 92 = 15 points\n\n- **Game 32**: Milwaukee Bucks, Score \"98 - 114\"  \n  Loss margin = 114 - 98 = 16 points\n\nThe largest loss margin is 16 points on December 30 against the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\n### Condition 2: Date of Largest Loss Margin\n\nFrom the above calculations, the largest loss margin of 16 points occurred on **December 30**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The claim states that the largest loss margin was 25 points. However, we found it to be 16 points.\n- Therefore, the claim is false because the largest loss margin was not 25 points.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant cells are those related to the games where losses occurred and their respective scores:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Check the outcome of this specific game:\n   - The score for the game against the Los Angeles Clippers is \"118 - 103\".\n   - Since \"118\" (Celtics' score) is greater than \"103\" (Clippers' score), it indicates a win, not a loss.\n\nThe claim states that they played only one game on Thursday and lost.
