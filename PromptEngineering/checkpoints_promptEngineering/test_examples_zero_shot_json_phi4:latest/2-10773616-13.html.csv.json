    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to verify several conditions from the provided table:\n\n**Claim:** \n\"When South Melbourne is the away team, their score was 8.18 (66) when they played at Lake Oval.\"\n\nWe will break down the claim into individual components and validate each against the data in the table.\n\n1. **Identify the match involving South Melbourne as the away team:**\n   - We need to look for a row where \"south melbourne\" is listed under the \"away team\" column.\n   \n2. **Check the score of South Melbourne:**\n   - For that specific match, verify if their score was recorded as \"8.18 (66)\" in the \"away team score\" column.\n\n3. **Verify the venue:**\n   - Ensure that this match took place at \"lake oval,\" which should be present in the \"venue\" column for the same row.\n\nNow, let's evaluate these conditions using the provided data:\n\n- The table is in JSON format and contains a list of matches with their respective details.\n  \n  **Row-by-row analysis:**\n\n  - **Row Index 0:**\n    - Home Team: hawthorn\n    - Away Team: st kilda\n    - This row does not involve South Melbourne.\n\n  - **Row Index 1:**\n    - Home Team: north melbourne\n    - Away Team: geelong\n    - This row does not involve South Melbourne.\n    \n  - **Row Index 2:**\n    - Home Team: melbourne\n    - Away Team: carlton\n    - This row does not involve South Melbourne.\n\n  - **Row Index 3:**\n    - Home Team: footscray\n    - Away Team: richmond\n    - This row does not involve South Melbourne.\n    \n  - **Row Index 4:**\n    - Home Team: south melbourne\n    - Away Team: essendon\n    - Venue: lake oval\n    - Away Team Score: 13.8 (86)\n    - Although the venue is \"lake oval,\" South Melbourne is listed as the home team here, not the away team.\n    \n  - **Row Index 5:**\n    - Home Team: fitzroy\n    - Away Team: collingwood\n    - This row does not involve South Melbourne.\n\nFrom this analysis, there is no instance in the table where \"south melbourne\" appears as the away team.
