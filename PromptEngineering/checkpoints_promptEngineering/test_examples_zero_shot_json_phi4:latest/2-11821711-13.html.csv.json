Let's examine these specific entries:\n\n1. Round 5:\n   - Player: Linden Rowat (G), Nationality: Canada\n   - Player: Joshua Turnbull (C), Nationality: United States\n\n2. Round 7:\n   - Player: Josh Kidd (D), Nationality: Canada\n   - Player: Matt Fillier (LW), Nationality: Canada\n\nFor each of these players, the nationality is either Canada or the United States.\n\nSince all players in rounds higher than 4 are from Canada or the United States, the claim holds true. The relevant cells for this verification include:\n\n- Round 5, Linden Rowat, Nationality\n- Round 5, Joshua Turnbull, Nationality\n- Round 7, Josh Kidd, Nationality\n- Round 7, Matt Fillier, Nationality\n\nNow we construct the JSON response with these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
