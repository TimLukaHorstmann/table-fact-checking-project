This part of the claim is false.\n\n### Part 2: 2003 Rome Opponent Check\n\n- We need to find the row where the year is 2003 and the championship is Rome.\n- From the table, we identify that:\n  - Row index 0 contains both the year 2003 and the championship \"rome.\"\n  - The opponents listed in this row are \"Jelena Doki\u0107 Nadia Petrova.\"\n\nTherefore, Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs were not the opponents in Rome in 2003. This part of the claim is also false.\n\nSince neither part of the claim matches the data in the table, the entire claim is false.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells:\n\n- For Part 1 (year 2005):\n  - Row index 4, column \"opponents\"\n  \n- For Part 2 (Rome in 2003):\n  - Row index 0, column \"opponents\"\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table in JSON format, we need to analyze each condition specified within the claim and compare it against the relevant data.\n\n### Claim Analysis\n\n1. **\"The partner in 2004 at the Indian Wells championship be Martina Navratilova\"**\n\n   - We need to find the row where the year is 2004 and the championship is \"Indian Wells\".\n   - According to the table:\n     - Row with `year: 2004`, `championship: indian wells`:\n       - Partner: \"elena likhovtseva\"\n   - The claim states that the partner should be \"martina navratilova\", but according to the data, it is actually \"elena likhovtseva\".\n   - Therefore, this part of the claim is false.\n\n2. **\"In 2003 at the Toronto championship, the partner be Lisa Raymond\"**\n\n   - We need to find the row where the year is 2003 and the championship is \"Toronto\".\n   - According to the table:\n     - Row with `year: 2003`, `championship: toronto`:\n       - Partner: \"martina navratilova\"\n   - The claim states that the partner should be \"Lisa Raymond\", but according to the data, it is actually \"Martina Navratilova\".\n   - Therefore, this part of the claim is also false.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are false based on the provided data. Thus, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nTo justify our conclusion:\n- For the first condition about the Indian Wells 2004 championship, we need to refer to the relevant cells for year, championship, and partner.\n- For the second condition about the Toronto 2003 championship, we also need the relevant cells for year, championship, and partner.\n\nThe indices in JSON format (starting from 0) are:\n\n1. Row index 2: Relevant columns are \"year\", \"championship\", \"partner\".\n2. Row index 1: Relevant columns are \"year\", \"championship\", \"partner\".\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"championship\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"championship\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
