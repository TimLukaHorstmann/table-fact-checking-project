    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding the table provided in JSON format, we need to verify two main components:\n\n1. Identify if there is a quarterback (QB) with a rating of 82.7.\n2. Confirm that this QB has scored exactly 136 touchdowns.\n\nThe relevant information from the table includes:\n- The \"qb rating\" column for checking the value 82.7.\n- The \"touchdowns\" column to check the number of touchdowns corresponding to that specific QB rating.\n\nLet's examine the data provided in the table:\n\n1. **Row 0** (Charley Johnson):\n   - QB Rating: 69.6\n   - Touchdowns: 108\n\n2. **Row 1** (Jake Plummer):\n   - QB Rating: 69.0\n   - Touchdowns: 90\n\n3. **Row 2** (Jim Hart):\n   - QB Rating: 66.6\n   - Touchdowns: 209\n\n4. **Row 3** (Kurt Warner):\n   - QB Rating: 91.9\n   - Touchdowns: 100\n\n5. **Row 4** (Neil Lomax):\n   - QB Rating: 82.7\n   - Touchdowns: 136\n\nFrom this analysis, we see that the player with a quarterback rating of 82.7 is indeed Neil Lomax, who has scored exactly 136 touchdowns.\n\nTherefore, both conditions in the claim are satisfied:\n- There exists a person (Neil Lomax) with a QB rating of 82.7.\n- This same person scored 136 touchdowns.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification from the JSON table are:\n- \"qb rating\" at row index 4 and column name \"qb rating\".\n- \"touchdowns\" at row index 4 and column name \"touchdowns\".\n\nHence, the claim is TRUE.
