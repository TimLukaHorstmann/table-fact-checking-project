The incumbent must not retire.\n2. If they do not retire, they must be re-elected.\n\nLet's examine each row to see if these conditions hold:\n\n1. **Row 0:**\n   - Incumbent: Hutchins G Burton\n   - Result: Re-elected\n   - Retirement Status: Not retired (since the result is \"re-elected\")\n   - Relevant cells:\n     - `column_name`: \"incumbent\", \"result\"\n     - `row_index`: 0\n\n2. **Row 1:**\n   - Incumbent: William S Blackledge\n   - Result: Retired (Democratic-Republican hold)\n   - Retirement Status: Retired\n   - Relevant cells:\n     - `column_name`: \"incumbent\", \"result\"\n     - `row_index`: 1\n\n3. **Row 2:**\n   - Incumbent: Charles Hooks\n   - Result: Re-elected\n   - Retirement Status: Not retired (since the result is \"re-elected\")\n   - Relevant cells:\n     - `column_name`: \"incumbent\", \"result\"\n     - `row_index`: 2\n\n4. **Row 3:**\n   - Incumbent: Weldon N Edwards\n   - Result: Re-elected\n   - Retirement Status: Not retired (since the result is \"re-elected\")\n   - Relevant cells:\n     - `column_name`: \"incumbent\", \"result\"\n     - `row_index`: 3\n\n5. **Row 4:**\n   - Incumbent: Archibald McNeill\n   - Result: Retired (Federalist hold)\n   - Retirement Status: Retired\n   - Relevant cells:\n     - `column_name`: \"incumbent\", \"result\"\n     - `row_index`: 4\n\n6. **Row 5:**\n   - Incumbent: Romulus M Saunders\n   - Result: Re-elected\n   - Retirement Status: Not retired (since the result is \"re-elected\")\n   - Relevant cells:\n     - `column_name`: \"incumbent\", \"result\"\n     - `row_index`: 5\n\n7. **Row 6:**\n   - Incumbent: John Long\n   - Result: Re-elected\n   - Retirement Status: Not retired (since the result is \"re-elected\")\n   - Relevant cells:\n     - `column_name`: \"incumbent\", \"result\"\n     - `row_index`: 6\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Rows 1 and 4 show incumbents who retired, which does not violate the claim.\n- All other incumbents who did not retire were re-elected.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data in the table.

We will look into these to check if incumbents were re-elected or not.\n   \n2. **Examine Each Row**: For each row, we'll determine whether the incumbent lost their election campaign by looking at the value in the \"result\" column.\n\n3. **Determine Election Year Context**:\n   - Although no explicit year 1822 is mentioned in the table, we can infer that since all incumbents were first elected between 1816 and 1821, it implies they served through or after these years.\n   - The focus should be on whether they were re-elected (i.e., \"re-elected\") or not.\n\n**Row-by-Row Analysis**:\n\n- **Row Index 0 (\"north carolina 2\")**:\n  - Result: \"re-elected\"\n  - This means the incumbent was re-elected, thus contradicting part of the claim.\n  \n- **Row Index 1 (\"north carolina 4\")**:\n  - Result: \"retired democratic - republican hold\"\n  - The incumbent retired; hence they did not lose in a re-election campaign. They simply chose not to run again.\n\n- **Row Index 2 (\"north carolina 5\")**:\n  - Result: \"re-elected\"\n  - This means the incumbent was re-elected, thus contradicting part of the claim.\n  \n- **Row Index 3 (\"north carolina 6\")**:\n  - Result: \"re-elected\"\n  - This indicates the incumbent was re-elected, further contradicting the claim.\n\n- **Row Index 4 (\"north carolina 7\")**:\n  - Result: \"retired federalist hold\"\n  - The incumbent retired; hence they did not lose in a re-election campaign.\n\n- **Row Index 5 (\"north carolina 9\")**:\n  - Result: \"re-elected\"\n  - The incumbent was re-elected, contradicting the claim.\n  \n- **Row Index 6 (\"north carolina 10\")**:\n  - Result: \"re-elected\"\n  - This indicates the incumbent was re-elected, contradicting the claim.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nThe claim that every North Carolina U.S. House of Representatives incumbent in 1822 lost their re-election campaign is false since multiple incumbents were either re-elected or retired without losing a re-election campaign.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can provide the following JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to analyze each row of the table and check for party flips in the North Carolina districts during the 1822 House of Representatives election.\n\nThe claim states: \"half of the district in the 1822 house of representative north carolina election have party flip.\" There are seven districts listed in the data. To validate this, we need to identify how many districts experienced a party change and compare it with half of the total number (which is 3.5; thus, at least 4 districts for a majority).\n\nHere's a breakdown of each district:\n\n1. **Row 0: North Carolina 2**\n   - Incumbent Party: Democratic-Republican\n   - Result: Re-elected (no party flip)\n\n2. **Row 1: North Carolina 4**\n   - Incumbent Party: Democratic-Republican\n   - Result: Retired, Democratic-Republican hold (no party flip)\n\n3. **Row 2: North Carolina 5**\n   - Incumbent Party: Democratic-Republican\n   - Result: Re-elected (no party flip)\n\n4. **Row 3: North Carolina 6**\n   - Incumbent Party: Democratic-Republican\n   - Result: Re-elected (no party flip)\n\n5. **Row 4: North Carolina 7**\n   - Incumbent Party: Federalist\n   - Result: Retired, Federalist hold (John Culpepper wins with 50.9%, no party flip)\n\n6. **Row 5: North Carolina 9**\n   - Incumbent Party: Democratic-Republican\n   - Result: Re-elected (no party flip)\n\n7. **Row 6: North Carolina 10**\n   - Incumbent Party: Democratic-Republican\n   - Result: Re-elected (no party flip)\n\nNone of the districts experienced a party change; all re-elections or retirements resulted in the same party holding power.\n\nTherefore, no district had a party flip.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the candidates in the 1822 North Carolina US House of Representatives election, we need to assess whether there were only women candidates according to the provided data.\n\nThe relevant part of the table is about candidates listed for each district:\n\n1. **Column \"candidates\"**: This column contains information about who was running for office, which is crucial for verifying the gender composition of candidates.\n2. **Timeframe and Location Context**: The claim specifically references the 1822 election in North Carolina.\n\nGiven that the dataset provided lists data from various years (1816, 1819, 1821) but does not explicitly mention 1822, we must consider whether the table includes all relevant elections for 1822. However, since no entries are listed under a year other than those mentioned, and none specifically for 1822, this implies that the dataset might not cover the entire election period of interest.\n\nNow, let's examine each row in the context of candidates:\n\n- **Row 0 (District: North Carolina 2)**: Candidates are Hutchins G. Burton and Jesse A. Dawson.\n- **Row 1 (District: North Carolina 4)**: Candidate is Richard Dobbs Spaight Jr.\n- **Row 2 (District: North Carolina 5)**: Candidate is Charles Hooks.\n- **Row 3 (District: North Carolina 6)**: Candidate is Weldon N.
