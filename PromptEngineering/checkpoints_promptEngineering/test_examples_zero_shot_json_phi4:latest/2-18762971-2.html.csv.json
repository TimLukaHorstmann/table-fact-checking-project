    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two specific conditions from the table:\n\n1. The match on April 14, 2001.\n2. The match on February 24, 2001.\n\nFor each of these matches, we must check if they were victories for the home team (\"h\"). A victory means that the \"result\" column shows a higher number of goals for the home team compared to their opponent.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n#### Match on April 14, 2001:\n- **Row Index**: We need to locate this date in the data. The match on April 14, 2001, is against Sheffield United at home (\"h\").\n- **Result**: The result of the match is \"1 - 2\".\n- **Analysis**: Since the result is \"1 - 2\", the home team lost (scored fewer goals than their opponent).\n\n#### Match on February 24, 2001:\n- **Row Index**: Locate this date in the data. The match on February 24, 2001, is against Preston North End away (\"a\").\n- **Result**: The result of the match is \"0 - 2\".\n- **Analysis**: Since it's an away game and the result is \"0 - 2\", the home team (Preston North End) won. However, for this claim, we need a home victory, so this does not count as a victory for us.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe match on April 14, 2001, was not a victory for the home team, and neither was the match on February 24, 2001 (since it was an away game). Therefore, the claim that both matches were victories is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- **April 14, 2001**:\n  - Row Index: 34\n  - Column Name: \"date\"\n  - Column Name: \"venue\"\n  - Column Name: \"result\"\n\n- **February 24, 2001**:\n  - Row Index: 22\n  - Column Name: \"date\"\n  - Column Name: \"venue\"\n  - Column Name: \"result\"\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
