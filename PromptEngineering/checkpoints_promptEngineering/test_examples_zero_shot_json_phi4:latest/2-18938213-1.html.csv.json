    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Yuri Kadenatsy (URS) won silver in 1982\" is true or false, we must examine the relevant cells from the provided table data.\n\nThe claim involves three conditions:\n1. The year should be 1982.\n2. Yuri Kadenatsy should have won a silver medal.\n3. The country code for Yuri Kadenatsy should be \"URS\".\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. **Locate the Year 1982**: We need to find the row where the \"year\" column is equal to 1982.\n\n   - From the data, we identify that the year 1982 corresponds to row index 7.\n\n2. **Check the Silver Medalist for Year 1982**:\n   - For the row with index 7 (corresponding to the year 1982), check the \"silver\" column.\n   - The entry in the \"silver\" column is \"yuri kadenatsy (urs)\".\n\n3. **Verify the Country Code**:\n   - Confirm that the country code for Yuri Kadenatsy is indeed \"URS\".\n   - In the same row, the data \"yuri kadenatsy (urs)\" matches this requirement.\n\nSince all conditions of the claim are satisfied by examining the relevant cells in the table, we conclude that the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this information are:\n- The \"year\" column at row index 7.\n- The \"silver\" column at row index 7.\n\nNow, let's construct the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Check if Yuri Kadenatsy is listed as having won the silver medal in that row.\n\n**Step-by-step Verification:**\n\n- **Locate the Year 1983:** \n  - From the given data, we find that the entry for the year 1983 is at `row_index` 8.\n\n- **Check the Silver Medal Winner for 1983:**\n  - In this row (row_index 8), the silver medal winner is listed as \"nikolai dedov (urs)\".\n  - Yuri Kadenatsy is not mentioned as a silver medalist in this row.\n\nSince Yuri Kadenatsy is not listed as the silver medalist for the year 1983, the claim is false.
