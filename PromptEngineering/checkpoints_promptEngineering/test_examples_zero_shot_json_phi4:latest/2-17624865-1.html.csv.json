Identify the fights involving Tim Coleman.\n2. Check if there is any record of Tim Coleman fighting against Ben Lock, specifically in the year 2006.\n\nLet's go through the data:\n\n- **Tim Coleman's Fight**:\n  - Date: \"2006 - 06 - 15\"\n  - Result: \"loss\"\n  - Opponent: \"tim coleman\"\n  - Other details are irrelevant for this claim.\n\n- **Ben Lock's Fight**:\n  - Date: \"2005 - 11 - 26\"\n  - Result: \"win\"\n  - Opponent: \"ben lock\"\n  - This fight occurred in November 2005, not 2006.\n\nFrom the table data, Tim Coleman did have a loss on June 15, 2006, but his opponent was not Ben Lock. There is no record of a fight between Tim Coleman and Ben Lock in 2006 or at any other time in the provided data. Therefore, the claim is true: Tim Coleman has not lost a fight against Ben Lock in 2006.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are those related to both Tim Coleman's and Ben Lock's fights:\n\n- For Tim Coleman:\n  - Row index 2, columns \"opponent\" and \"result\".\n\n- For Ben Lock:\n  - Row index 6, columns \"opponent\" and \"date\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim about Muhsin Corbbrey's fights between 2006 and 2009, we need to analyze the table data based on specific criteria outlined in the claim:\n\n1. **Fights must have occurred between 2006 and 2009:** We will filter rows by their \"date\" column to see if they fall within this range.\n\n2. **The fight should be a 4-round fight:** We need to check the \"round\" column for fights that lasted exactly 4 rounds.\n\n3. **The fight must have gone more than 5 rounds:** This condition seems contradictory because it states a 4-round fight needs to last more than 5 rounds, which is logically impossible. Therefore, no fight can satisfy both being a 4-round fight and lasting more than 5 rounds.\n\nLet's evaluate the data from the table:\n\n- **2009 - 02 - 28:** This fight had 6 rounds.\n- **2006 - 09 - 15:** This fight lasted 4 rounds but did not exceed 5 rounds.\n- **2006 - 06 - 15:** This fight had 6 rounds.\n- **2006 - 04 - 21:** This fight lasted only 1 round.\n- **2006 - 03 - 09:** This fight lasted 4 rounds, but again, did not exceed 5 rounds.\n- **2006 - 01 - 26:** This fight lasted 4 rounds and did not go beyond that.\n- **2005 - 11 - 26:** This fight lasted 4 rounds but was outside the date range (before 2006).\n- **2005 - 04 - 26:** This fight lasted 4 rounds, but again, it was before 2006.\n- **2005 - 04 - 08:** This fight had 4 rounds and was also prior to 2006.\n\nNone of the fights satisfy all conditions (i.e., being a 4-round fight that lasts more than 5 rounds) within the specified time frame.
