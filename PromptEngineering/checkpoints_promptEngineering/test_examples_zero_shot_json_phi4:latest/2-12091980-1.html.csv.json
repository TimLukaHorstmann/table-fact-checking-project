    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"no game be play when the goal for be less than 30\", we need to examine the column labeled \"goals for\" in the given table data. The task is to check if there is any row where \"goals for\" is less than 30.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The relevant column for this claim is \"goals for\".\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - For each team, look at the value under the \"goals for\" column and check if it is less than 30.\n   - We will go through the data row by row to find any such instance.\n\n3. **Row Analysis**:\n   - **Row 0**: Ottawa Hockey Club has \"goals for\" = 90 (not less than 30).\n   - **Row 1**: Montreal Wanderers have \"goals for\" = 74 (not less than 30).\n   - **Row 2**: Montreal Victorias have \"goals for\" = 76 (not less than 30).\n   - **Row 3**: Quebec Hockey Club has \"goals for\" = 57 (not less than 30).\n   - **Row 4**: Montreal Hockey Club has \"goals for\" = 49 (not less than 30).\n   - **Row 5**: Montreal Shamrocks have \"goals for\" = 30 (equal to 30, not less than 30).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - In all the rows, there is no instance where \"goals for\" is less than 30.\n\nSince no row has a value in the \"goals for\" column that is less than 30, the claim is supported by the data.\n\nThus, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
