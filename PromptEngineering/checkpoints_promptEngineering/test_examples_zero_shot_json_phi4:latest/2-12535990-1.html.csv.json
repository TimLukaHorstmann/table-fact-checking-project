    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the Kansas City Chiefs won 12 matches in the 1968 season\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to verify two main aspects:\n\n1. **Team Identification**: Confirm that the team being described by their performance (i.e., wins) in the table is indeed the Kansas City Chiefs.\n2. **Win Count Verification**: Count how many matches were won as indicated by \"w\" in the \"result\" column and ensure it sums to 12.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. **Team Identification**:\n   - The team's name (\"Kansas City Chiefs\") is not explicitly mentioned in the table. However, we must assume that the data provided pertains to them because of the claim referencing a specific NFL team from 1968.\n\n2. **Win Count Verification**:\n   - We need to iterate through each row in the \"data\" section and count occurrences where the result starts with \"w\", indicating a win.\n   \n3. **Examination of Each Game Result**:\n   - Week 1: \"w 26 - 21\"\n   - Week 2: \"l 20 - 19\"\n   - Week 3: \"w 34 - 2\"\n   - Week 4: \"w 48 - 3\"\n   - Week 5: \"w 18 - 7\"\n   - Week 6: \"w 13 - 3\"\n   - Week 7: \"w 24 - 10\"\n   - Week 8: \"w 27 - 20\"\n   - Week 9: \"l 38 - 21\"\n   - Week 10: \"w 16 - 9\"\n   - Week 11: \"w 31 - 17\"\n   - Row for week 12 is missing in the table.\n   - Week 13: \"w 24 - 10\"\n   - Week 14: \"w 40 - 3\"\n   - Week 15: \"w 30 - 7\"\n\n4. **Count of Wins**:\n   - By counting the occurrences of \"w\" in the result column, we find there are 11 wins.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states they won 12 matches; however, according to the data provided, only 11 matches were won.\n   \nTherefore, the claim is false as per the table data given.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n\nThe relevant cells are those containing \"w\" in the \"result\" column.

We will examine all entries under the \"attendance\" column:\n\n1. Week 1: Houston Oilers - Attendance: 45,083\n2. Week 2: New York Jets - Attendance: 48,871\n3. Week 3: Denver Broncos - Attendance: 45,821\n4. Week 4: Miami Dolphins - Attendance: 28,501\n5. Week 5: Buffalo Bills - Attendance: 40,748\n6. Week 6: Cincinnati Bengals - Attendance: 47,096\n7.

Week 15: Denver Broncos - Attendance: 38,463\n\nThe game against the Miami Dolphins in Week 4 had an attendance of 28,501.\n\nBy examining all the attendance figures, it is clear that the most popularly attended game was played in Week 9 against the Oakland Raiders with an attendance of 53,357. Therefore, the claim that the most popularly attended game was against the Miami Dolphins is false.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this are those under the \"attendance\" column where we find both the highest and the Miami Dolphins' specific attendance:\n\n- The cell indicating Week 9 (against Oakland Raiders) with the highest attendance.\n- The cell indicating Week 4 (against Miami Dolphins).\n\nThus, our answer to the claim is FALSE. \n\nHere's the corresponding JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
