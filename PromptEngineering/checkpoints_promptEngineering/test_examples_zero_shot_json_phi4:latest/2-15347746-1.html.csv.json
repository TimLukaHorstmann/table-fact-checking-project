Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify the claim are:\n\n- Row index 3, \"player\" column: \"andre fluellen\"\n- Row index 3, \"position\" column: \"defensive tackle\"\n- Row index 3, \"round\" column: 3\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify if a player from Central Florida was selected in round 3 and whether this is indeed the earliest round for such a selection based on the given data.\n\nThe relevant steps include:\n\n1. **Identify players from Central Florida:**\n   - We scan through each row in the \"data\" array to find entries where the \"team\" column matches \"central florida\".\n   \n2. **Check the rounds for these players:**\n   - For any player identified as being from Central Florida, we check which round they were selected in by examining the \"round\" column.\n\n3. **Verify if this is the earliest round:**\n   - We need to ensure that there are no players from Central Florida selected in an earlier round than 3.\n\nLet's go through the data:\n\n- Row 0 (Pick 17): Player \"gosder cherilus\", Team \"boston college\" \u2013 Not relevant.\n- Row 1 (Pick 45): Player \"jordon dizon\", Team \"colorado\" \u2013 Not relevant.\n- **Row 2 (Pick 64):** Player \"kevin smith\", Position \"running back\", Team \"central florida\". This is round 3, so it matches the condition of being from Central Florida and selected in round 3.\n- Row 3 (Pick 87): Player \"andre fluellen\", Team \"florida state\" \u2013 Not relevant.\n- Row 4 (Pick 92): Player \"cliff avril\", Team \"purdue\" \u2013 Not relevant.\n- Row 5 (Pick 136): Player \"kenneth moore , jr\", Team \"wake forest\" \u2013 Not relevant.\n- Row 6 (Pick 146): Player \"jerome felton\", Team \"furman\" \u2013 Not relevant.\n- Row 7 (Pick 216): Player \"landon cohen\", Team \"ohio\" \u2013 Not relevant.\n- Row 8 (Pick 218): Player \"caleb campbell\", Team \"army\" \u2013 Not relevant.\n\nFrom this analysis, we see that \"kevin smith\" from Central Florida was picked in round 3.
