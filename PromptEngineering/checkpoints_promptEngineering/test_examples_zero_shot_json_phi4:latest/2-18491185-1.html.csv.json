We need to verify if this matches the date in the table for the first episode.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row Index 0, Column Name \"episode\": This verifies we are looking at the correct episode (the first one).\n- Row Index 0, Column Name \"date\": This is where we check the airing date of the first episode to see if it matches \"7 / 02 / 08\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- In row index 0, the \"episode\" is \"one\", and the \"date\" is indeed \"7 / 02 / 08\".\n- Since both conditions are satisfied, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

These two columns are relevant for identifying when each episode airs.\n\n2. **Row Verification**:\n   - For episode one, we locate the row where \"episode\" is \"one\".\n   - According to the table, in the first row (row_index 0), the data is as follows:\n     - episode: \"one\"\n     - date: \"7 / 02 / 08\"\n\n3. **Date Verification**:\n   - The claim states that episode one aired on \"7 / 21 / 08\".\n   - From our verification, we see that episode one actually aired on \"7 / 02 / 08\", not \"7 / 21 / 08\".\n\nSince the date in the table for episode one does not match the date given in the claim, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- The relevant cells to verify this are:\n  - Row 0, Column \"episode\"\n  - Row 0, Column \"date\"\n\nThus, the final JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
