A back-to-back set involves two consecutive days with games scheduled, which in this context means checking for games on both January 4 and January 5.\n\nLet's evaluate each relevant entry:\n\n1. **Row 36 (January 4):** The game was against Los Angeles Clippers.\n2. **Row 37 (January 5):** The game was against Memphis.\n\nThese two rows indicate that Portland played back-to-back games on January 4 and January 5, satisfying the condition for a single set of back-to-back games during this specific period.\n\nNext, we need to ensure there are no additional back-to-back sets within the entire range specified (from January 2 through January 29) as part of verifying that only one such set occurred during the period in question:\n\n- **Row 35 (January 2):** The game was against Golden State. No consecutive game on January 3.\n- **Row 36 & Row 37:** Already checked for back-to-back games on January 4 and January 5.\n- **Row 38 (January 8):** The next game after January 7 rest day, so no consecutive game from January 6 to January 7.\n- **Other Rows:** None of the other dates have consecutive days with scheduled games.\n\nThus, the only back-to-back set during this period is indeed between January 4 and January 5.\n\nGiven these observations, the claim that Portland played only one back-to-back set of games from January 4 through January 5 is TRUE.
