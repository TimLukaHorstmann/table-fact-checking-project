Additionally, Geoff Masters is mentioned in the opponents' names, so we check if he appears there on the same entry.\n3. **Outcome Verification (Optional):** Though not explicitly required by the claim, knowing the match result can add context to verify the overall consistency of information.\n\nUpon examining the table:\n\n- The date \"15 november 1976\" matches a row in the data:\n  - This is found at `row_index: 14`.\n  \n- In this row:\n  - The column \"partner\" lists \"corrado barazzutti,\" which aligns with the claim.\n  - The opponents listed are \"ross case geoff masters,\" confirming that Geoff Masters was indeed one of the opponents.\n\nBased on these findings, all conditions in the claim are met: Corrado Barazzutti is a partner, and Geoff Masters is among the opponents on November 15, 1976. Therefore, the statement is accurate.\n\nThe relevant cells involved in verifying this claim are:\n- Row at index 14 for the date \"15 november 1976.\"\n- The same row's column \"partner\" which lists Corrado Barazzutti.\n- The same row's column \"opponents\" where Geoff Masters is listed.\n\nConsequently, we conclude that the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
