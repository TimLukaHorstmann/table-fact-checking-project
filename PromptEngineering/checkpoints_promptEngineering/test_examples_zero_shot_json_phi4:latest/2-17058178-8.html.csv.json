The claim states that the Blazers won 9 games and lost 5 games within the specified period.\n\nLet's examine each entry:\n\n1. **Game 33**: Record is \"20 - 13\" (L)\n2. **Game 34**: Record is \"20 - 14\" (L)\n3. **Game 35**: Record is \"21 - 14\" (W)\n4. **Game 36**: Record is \"22 - 14\" (W)\n5. **Game 37**: Record is \"23 - 14\" (W)\n6. **Game 38**: Record is \"23 - 15\" (L)\n7. **Game 39**: Record is \"24 - 15\" (W)\n8. **Game 40**: Record is \"24 - 16\" (L)\n9. **Game 41**: Record is \"25 - 16\" (W)\n10. **Game 42**: Record is \"25 - 17\" (L)\n11. **Game 43**: Record is \"26 - 17\" (W)\n12. **Game 44**: Record is \"27 - 17\" (W)\n13. **Game 45**: Record is \"28 - 17\" (W)\n14. **Game 46**: Record is \"29 - 17\" (W)\n\nFrom this data, we can count the number of wins and losses:\n\n- Wins: Games 35, 36, 37, 39, 41, 43, 44, 45, 46 (9 wins)\n- Losses: Games 33, 34, 38, 40, 42 (5 losses)\n\nThe record from the start of this stretch to Game 46 is indeed 29 - 17.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify whether Joel Przybyl\u0142a had the highest rebounds in Game 36 among all Blazer players listed for that game.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: We focus on \"game\" number 36 and its corresponding data within the table.\n   - The row index for Game 36 is `3` (since indexing starts from `0`).\n\n2. **Extract High Rebounds for Game 36**:\n   - From the table, the \"high rebounds\" entry for Game 36 (index 3) states: `\"greg oden (8)\"`.\n   - This indicates Greg Oden had 8 rebounds, which is the highest recorded in this game.\n\n3. **Compare with Joel Przybyl\u0142a's Rebounds**:\n   - The same row also lists high rebounds for Joel Przybyl\u0142a as `\"(8)\"`, sharing the top rebound count with Greg Oden.\n   - The presence of both names with equal values indicates a tie, not an exclusive highest by Przybyl\u0142a.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- **Claim Analysis**: The claim states that Joel Przybyl\u0142a had the \"highest\" rebounds, which implies he alone achieved this record. However, since Greg Oden also recorded 8 rebounds, Przybyl\u0142a did not have a uniquely higher rebound count.\n- Thus, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row index `3`, column `\"high rebounds\"` (contains both players' rebound counts).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
