Here's a step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Data:**\n   - We need to locate the entry related to Nigel Pargetter.\n   - This involves finding the row with \"nigel pargetter\" under the \"actor\" column and ensuring it corresponds to \"the archers.\"\n\n2. **Check Duration of Performance:**\n   - Once located, we should verify the \"years\" column to calculate or confirm how long he acted in the show.\n   - We also check the \"duration\" column for a direct duration claim.\n\n3. **Compare Against Claimed Duration:**\n   - The claim states that Nigel Pargetter acted for 61 years. This needs to be cross-checked against what's presented in the table.\n\nLet's execute these steps with the data:\n\n- From the table, the row containing \"nigel pargetter\" is:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"actor\": \"graham seed\",\n    \"character\": \"nigel pargetter\",\n    \"soap opera\": \"the archers\",\n    \"years\": \"1983 - 1986 , 1992 - 2011\",\n    \"duration\": \"22 years\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Row Index and Columns:**\n  - The relevant row index is `40`.\n  - The column names for verification are \"actor,\" \"character,\" \"soap opera,\" \"years,\" and \"duration.\"\n\n4. **Verification of Claim:**\n   - According to the table, Graham Seed played Nigel Pargetter from 1983-1986 and again from 1992-2011.\n   - Totaling these periods: \n     - From 1983 to 1986 is 3 years (including both start and end years).\n     - From 1992 to 2011 is 20 years.\n   - Combined, this totals 23 years. However, the \"duration\" column directly states it as 22 years.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim mentions a duration of 61 years, which does not match with the actual performance duration listed (22 years) or calculated (23 years).\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nBased on this analysis, here's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 40, \"column_name\": \"actor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 40, \"column_name\": \"character\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 40, \"column_name\": \"soap opera\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 40, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 40, \"column_name\": \"duration\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
