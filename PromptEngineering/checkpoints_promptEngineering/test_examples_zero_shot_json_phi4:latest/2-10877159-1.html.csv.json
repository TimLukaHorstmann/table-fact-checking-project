Area = \"6.38 km\"\n2. Density = \"8546.1\"\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n1. **Check the area condition:**\n   - The claim states that Wanchaq's area is \"6.38 km.\" However, from the table, it is \"6.38 km square.\"\n   - While the numerical value matches (6.38), there is a slight discrepancy in wording (\"km\" vs. \"km square\"). This might be considered as equivalent for some interpretations.\n\n2. **Check the density condition:**\n   - The claim specifies Wanchaq's density as \"8546.1,\" which exactly matches the table's value of \"8546.1 hab / km square.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The area condition is nearly met but has a minor wording discrepancy.\n- The density condition is fully satisfied.\n\nGiven that the primary focus should be on the numerical accuracy and understanding that the term \"km\" without \"square\" is generally understood in context, we conclude that the claim is practically true if considering practical interpretation.
