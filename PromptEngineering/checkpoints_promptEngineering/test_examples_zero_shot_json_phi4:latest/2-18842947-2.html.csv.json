    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"the most points scored by the Lions in a single game was 58\" is true or false based on the given table data, we need to focus on the \"result\" column of each row. The relevant information within this column consists of scores achieved by the Lions against their opponents.\n\nEach entry in the \"result\" column follows the format \"L/W [Lions' Score] - [Opponent's Score]\", where L indicates a loss and W indicates a win for the Lions. Our task is to identify the maximum score the Lions scored in any single game listed in the data.\n\nLet's go through each row step-by-step:\n\n1. Week 1: \"l 10 - 3\" \u2014 The Lions scored 10 points.\n2. Week 2: \"w 24 - 10\" \u2014 The Lions scored 24 points.\n3. Week 3: \"l 10 - 9\" \u2014 The Lions scored 10 points.\n4.
