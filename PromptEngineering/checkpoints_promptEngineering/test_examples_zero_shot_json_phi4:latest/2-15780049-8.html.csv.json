    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify specific conditions against the data in the provided table.\n\n### Claim Analysis\n\nThe claim states: \"Vince Carter and Hakeem Olajuwon be the high rebounders in game 62 against Houston.\"\n\nWe break this down into two parts:\n1. **Game Identification**: The claim specifically refers to \"game 62.\" We need to find row 61 (since indexing starts at 0) which corresponds to game 62.\n2. **High Rebounders**: Check if both Vince Carter and Hakeem Olajuwon are listed as the high rebounders for that particular game.\n\n### Verification Process\n\n1. **Locate Game 62**:\n   - From the table, row index 61 represents \"game 62\" (since indexing starts from 0).\n\n2. **Check High Rebounds in Row Index 61**:\n   - Locate the column labeled \"high rebounds.\"\n   - The value for this column in row index 61 is \"vince carter , hakeem olajuwon (7).\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- Both Vince Carter and Hakeem Olajuwon are indeed listed as high rebounders with 7 rebounds each for game 62 against Houston.\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table. The relevant cells to verify this include:\n- Row index: 61 (for game 62)\n- Column name: \"high rebounds\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 61, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"Orlando win game 65 with a score of 79 - 92,\" we need to examine specific elements from the given table:\n\n1. **Game Identification**: We first locate Game 65 in the data section, which corresponds to `row_index = 6`.\n2. **Opponent Verification**: The \"team\" column for this row specifies \"orlando.\" This matches the opponent mentioned in the claim.\n3. **Result and Score Check**:\n   - The \"score\" column indicates \"l 79 - 92 (ot).\" \n   - This means the team lost (\"l\") with a score of 79 to Orlando's 92.\n\nGiven these details, we find that the claim is incorrect because the game was lost by the home team, not won.

Hence, this part of the claim is false.\n\n3. **Checking High Assists on March 10:**\n   - Locate the \"high assists\" cell for the same row.\n   - According to the table, the high assists are recorded as \"Vince Carter (4).\"\n   - The claim states Alvin Williams had 9 assists, but the record shows Vince Carter with 4. Hence, this part of the claim is also false.\n\nGiven these checks, both parts of the claim do not match the data in the table:\n\n- **Claim about high points**: FALSE\n- **Claim about high assists**: FALSE\n\nSince neither condition from the claim matches the table's data for March 10, the entire claim is determined to be false.\n\nNow, let's compile this into a valid JSON response with the relevant cells identified:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object indicates that the claim is false and specifies which cells were relevant to making this determination.",
