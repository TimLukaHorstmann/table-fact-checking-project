We must check each row to determine if any winning record for Johnny Miller exists and what his margin of victory was, specifically looking for whether it reaches or exceeds 14 strokes.\n\nUpon examining the table:\n\n- The data does not mention Johnny Miller at all.\n- The highest recorded \"margin of victory\" in the table is 14 strokes, achieved by Jerry Heard on January 12, 1975, during the Phoenix Open. However, this margin was not achieved by Johnny Miller but by another golfer.\n\nSince there are no records involving Johnny Miller and his highest possible margin of victory according to this data can't be determined (due to absence), we conclude that:\n\n- The claim about Johnny Miller's highest margin being 14 strokes is FALSE because he does not appear in the table, and therefore there is no evidence supporting or refuting the specific number.\n\nThus, the JSON response should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\nNo relevant cells are applicable since Johnny Miller's name does not appear in any row of the provided data.",

The **tournament** column: We want to find any occurrence of \"us open\".\n2. The **runner(s) - up** column: This column lists individuals who did not win but are notable in context, which can help verify if Johnny Miller participated or finished runner-up.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n- **Row 0**: Tournament is \"southern open invitational\", no mention of US Open.\n- **Row 1**: Tournament is \"sea pines heritage classic\", no mention of US Open.\n- **Row 2**: Tournament is \"us open\". The runner(s) - up listed is \"john schlee\". Johnny Miller is not mentioned here as either the winner or runner-up. This indicates his presence isn't noted in this entry.\n- **Rows 3 to 21**: None of these rows list the US Open tournament, so they are irrelevant for verifying Johnny Miller's participation in that specific event.\n  \nThus, based on the available data, there is no evidence that Johnny Miller participated often or even once as a winner or runner-up in the US Open. The only relevant row (row index 2) where \"us open\" appears does not mention Johnny Miller.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that \"Johnny Miller often played in the US Open tournament\" is **FALSE** based on the data provided. There is no indication of his participation, let alone frequent participation, in this dataset.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"runner (s) - up\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
