Verify that all these occurrences are for races that happened in 1991.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant columns and rows from the JSON table:\n\n- The column \"winner\" will tell us who won each race, which we need to check against \"Jim Richards.\"\n- The column \"date\" provides information about when each race occurred.

This matches with \"late February\".\n   \n   - **Latest Race**:\n     - The last listed date in the table is \"9 - 11 Aug\".

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Mark Skaife won all of his last 4 race drives for Nissan\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data focusing on Mark Skaife's performances and verify if they match the conditions specified in the claim.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Races Won by Mark Skaife**:\n   - We are interested in races where \"Mark Skaife\" is listed as the winner and his team is \"Nissan Motor Sport\".\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Rows**:\n   - From the table, we identify rows where Mark Skaife has won a race for Nissan.\n   - These rows are:\n     - Row 3: \"wanneroo\", Date: \"12 - 14 apr\"\n     - Row 6: \"mallala\", Date: \"21 - 23 jun\"\n     - Row 8: \"oran park\", Date: \"9 - 11 aug\"\n\n3. **Count the Wins**:\n   - Mark Skaife has won 3 races for Nissan, as identified above.\n\n4. **Check Against Claim**:\n   - The claim states that he won all of his last 4 race drives for Nissan.\n   - Since he only has 3 wins listed, it is impossible for him to have won 4 races in a row.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is false because Mark Skaife did not win 4 consecutive races for Nissan; he won only 3 as per the table data.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- For Row 3: Columns \"winner\", \"team\"\n- For Row 6: Columns \"winner\", \"team\"\n- For Row 8: Columns \"winner\", \"team\"\n\nThese cells are relevant because they verify Mark Skaife's wins for Nissan.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
