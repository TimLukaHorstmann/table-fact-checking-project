    "resp": "To evaluate the claim against the provided table data, we need to carefully verify each part of the statement:\n\nThe claim states: \"four ace win 800 credit at 5 credit but only 160 credit at 1 credit.\"\n\nThis means:\n1. For a \"four ace\" hand with a bet of 5 credits, the payout should be 800 credits.\n2. For a \"four ace\" hand with a bet of 1 credit, the payout should be 160 credits.\n\nTo verify this claim, we will search for the row corresponding to \"four aces\" and check the values in the \"5 credits\" and \"1 credit\" columns.\n\nFrom the table:\n- The row for \"four aces\" is at index 4.\n- In column \"5 credits\", the value is \"800\".\n- In column \"1 credit\", the value is \"160\".\n\nBoth conditions specified in the claim match the data from the table:\n\n1. The payout for \"four aces\" with a 5 credit bet is indeed 800 credits.\n2. The payout for \"four aces\" with a 1 credit bet is indeed 160 credits.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"5 credits\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1 credit\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down and verify each part of it against the given table:\n\n1. **Claim Part 1**: \"four ace yield 900 for 5 credit\"\n   - We need to check the value in the row corresponding to \"four aces\" under the column labeled \"5 credits\".\n   - In the provided data, there are two entries related to four aces:\n     - \"four aces w / 2 , 3 , or 4\" has values [400, 800, 1200, 1600, 2000].\n     - \"four aces\" has values [160, 320, 480, 640, 800].\n\n   - None of these entries show a value of 900 for the \"5 credits\" column. Thus, the claim that \"four ace yield 900 for 5 credit\" is incorrect.\n\n2. **Claim Part 2**: \"the result for 1 credit would be 160\"\n   - We need to check the value in the row corresponding to \"four aces\" under the column labeled \"1 credit\".\n   - As mentioned above, there are two entries related to four aces:\n     - \"four aces w / 2 , 3 , or 4\" has a value of 400 for \"1 credit\".\n     - \"four aces\" has a value of 160 for \"1 credit\".\n\n   - The second entry (\"four aces\") does have a value of 160 for the \"1 credit\" column, which aligns with this part of the claim.\n\nSince one part of the claim is incorrect (the value for \"four ace yield 900 for 5 credit\"), the overall claim is false. We need to identify and return the relevant cells that were checked:\n\n- For checking \"four aces w / 2 , 3 , or 4\" in \"5 credits\", we have:\n  - Row index 2, Column name \"5 credits\"\n\n- For checking \"four aces\" in \"5 credits\":\n  - Row index 4, Column name \"5 credits\"\n\n- For checking \"four aces\" in \"1 credit\":\n  - Row index 4, Column name \"1 credit\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"5 credits\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"5 credits\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1 credit\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
