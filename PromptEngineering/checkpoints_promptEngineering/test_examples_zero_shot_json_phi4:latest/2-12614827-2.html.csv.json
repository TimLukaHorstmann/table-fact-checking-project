    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"rob emerson played at the ufc 87 event 3 times in his career\" is true or false, we need to analyze the provided table:\n\n1. **Identify Relevance**: The claim specifically mentions UFC 87 and playing three times there. Therefore, we should look for entries related to UFC 87.\n\n2. **Search for UFC 87**:\n   - We scan through the \"event\" column to find any instance of \"ufc 87\".\n\n3. **Examine Relevant Data**:\n   - At row index 10, we find an entry with \"event\" as \"ufc 87\".\n   - The details are: \n     - Result: Win\n     - Record: 8 - 6 (1)\n     - Opponent: Manny Gamburyan\n     - Method: KO (punches)\n     - Event: UFC 87\n     - Round: 1\n     - Location: Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States\n\n4. **Count Occurrences**:\n   - We need to verify how many times \"ufc 87\" appears in the \"event\" column.\n   - Upon checking all rows, \"ufc 87\" appears only once.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since \"ufc 87\" is mentioned only once in the table, the claim that Rob Emerson played at UFC 87 three times is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Cell Identification**:\n   - The relevant cell for verifying this claim is at row index 10 with the column name \"event\".\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to verify two key aspects of the statement:\n\n1. Identify if Rob Emerson had a match against Eric Reynolds.\n2. Verify if this specific match was decided by a \"decision\" method and check if it's the only such instance in the dataset.\n\n**Step-by-step Verification:**\n\n- **Identify Rob Emerson vs. Eric Reynolds Match:**\n  - The table contains various rows with data about different matches, including opponents' names and methods of victory or defeat.\n  - Locate the row where \"opponent\" is \"eric reynolds\".\n    - From the table, at `row_index` 3:\n      - Opponent: Eric Reynolds\n      - Method: Decision (split)\n      - Event: Art of Fighting 10\n\n- **Determine if This Is the Only Match with a \"Decision\" Method:**\n  - We need to check each row in the data for matches that ended by a decision method.\n  - The relevant methods to look for are variations on \"decision,\" which include:\n    - Decision (unanimous)\n    - Decision (split)\n    - Decision (majority)\n\n- **Check Each Row:**\n  - `row_index` 3, \"opponent\": Eric Reynolds, \"method\": Decision (split) \u2014 This matches the claim.\n  - Check other rows for any instances of a decision:\n    - `row_index` 2: Justin Salas, method: Decision (unanimous)\n    - `row_index` 5: Rodney Rhoden, method not \"decision\"\n    - `row_index` 6: Nik Lentz, method: Decision (unanimous)\n    - `row_index` 7: Phillipe Nover, method: Decision (unanimous)\n    - `row_index` 8: Rafael Dos Anjos, method: Decision (unanimous)\n    - `row_index` 9: Kurt Pellegrino, method not \"decision\"\n    - `row_index` 11: Keita Nakamura, method: Decision (split)\n    - `row_index` 12: Gray Maynard, method not \"decision\"\n    - `row_index` 13: Kenji Arai, method not \"decision\"\n    - `row_index` 14: Randy Velarde, method: Decision (majority)\n    - `row_index` 15: Joe Camacho, method not \"decision\"\n    - `row_index` 17: Javier Vazquez, method: Decision (split)\n\n- **Conclusion:**\n  - There are multiple instances where the match was decided by a decision method.
