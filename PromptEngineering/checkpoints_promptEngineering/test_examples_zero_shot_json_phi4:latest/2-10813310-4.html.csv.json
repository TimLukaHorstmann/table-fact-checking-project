    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"at the venue the stoop, the score be 24 - 28,\" we need to verify two specific conditions in the provided table: the match played at \"the stoop\" and whether the score of that match was indeed \"24 - 28\".\n\n### Steps for Verification:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row**:\n   - We must find a row where the `venue` column equals \"the stoop\". This helps in locating the exact game being referenced.\n\n2. **Verify the Score**:\n   - Once we locate the correct venue, check if the `score` column matches \"24 - 28\".\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n- **Locating the Venue:**\n  - We iterate over each row to find where the `venue` is \"the stoop\".\n  - Upon inspection of the table data, there is a match on:\n    ```json\n    [\n      \"31 / 8 / 97\",\n      \"super league ii\",\n      \"the stoop\",\n      \"l\",\n      \"24 - 28\",\n      \"mcnamara 4 / 4\"\n    ]\n    ```\n    This row corresponds to `row_index` 19 in the JSON data array (as index is zero-based).\n\n- **Verifying the Score:**\n  - In the same row where the venue is \"the stoop\", we check if the score matches \"24 - 28\". The score recorded is indeed \"24 - 28\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data in `row_index` 19:\n- The venue is \"the stoop\".\n- The score is \"24 - 28\".\n\nThus, the claim is verified as TRUE.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
