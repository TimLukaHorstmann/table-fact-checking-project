    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to understand what a \"nightwatchman\" in cricket is and verify if there are two such players from Australia based on the provided table.\n\nA nightwatchman is typically a lower-order batsman sent in to bat at number 11 or sometimes earlier when the team's top order has been dismissed. The strategy aims to protect better batsmen by having someone face potentially difficult conditions like deteriorating light and variable pitch conditions, often towards the end of the day. A player who plays as a nightwatchman usually doesn't score many runs, often due to being deliberately given out or getting caught.\n\nLet's evaluate each entry in the data for potential nightwatchman scenarios:\n\n1. **Row 0:** Nasim-ul-Ghani (Pakistan) scored 101 against England in 1962. This is a high score and not characteristic of a nightwatchman innings.\n   \n2. **Row 1:** Tony Mann (Australia) scored 105 against India in 1977. Again, this is a high score and indicative of an opener or middle-order batsman.\n\n3. **Row 2:** Syed Kirmani (India) scored 101 not out against Australia in 1979. This high score suggests he was not playing as a nightwatchman.\n\n4. **Row 3:** Mark Boucher (South Africa) scored 125 against Zimbabwe in 1999. A century like this is typical of higher-order batsmen, not a nightwatchman.\n\n5. **Row 4:** Mark Boucher again scored 108 against England in 1999. This high score indicates he was not batting as a nightwatchman.\n\n6. **Row 5:** Jason Gillespie (Australia) scored 201 not out against Bangladesh in 2006. A double century is far from the expected performance of a nightwatchman.\n\nFrom this analysis, none of the entries suggest that any player listed played as a nightwatchman, and specifically, no Australian players are identified with such innings. Therefore, the claim \"2 players in the nightwatchman (cricket) come from Australia\" is not supported by the table data.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
