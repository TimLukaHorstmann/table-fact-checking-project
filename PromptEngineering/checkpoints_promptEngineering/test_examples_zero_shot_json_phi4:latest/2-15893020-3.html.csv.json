    "resp": "To verify the claim \"average be 0.1 for deon kruis,\" we need to identify the relevant cell in the provided table that contains Deon Kruis's batting average. The key columns for this verification are \"player\" and \"average.\"\n\n1. Locate the row where the player is \"deon kruis.\" From the data, it is clear that Deon Kruis is listed in the 17th row (considering the first row as index 0).\n\n2. In the 17th row for Deon Kruis, check the value under the \"average\" column. The average is given as \"n / a,\" which stands for not applicable or unavailable data.\n\n3. Compare this with the claim that states the average should be 0.1. Since the batting average is marked as \"n / a\" (not available), it cannot be said to be 0.1. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n4. The relevant cell for verifying the claim is found at row index 17 under the column named \"average.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"average\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
