    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to compare the crowd sizes at two specific venues: VFL Park and MCG.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data from the Table**:\n   - The column \"venue\" will help identify which row corresponds to each venue.\n   - The column \"crowd\" provides the number of attendees for each game.\n\n2. **Extract Crowd Data**:\n   - For the game at VFL Park:\n     - Locate the row where \"venue\" is \"vfl park\".\n     - From this row, extract the value in the \"crowd\" column.\n   - For the game at MCG:\n     - Locate the row where \"venue\" is \"mcg\".\n     - From this row, extract the value in the \"crowd\" column.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference**:\n   - Subtract the crowd size at VFL Park from the crowd size at MCG.\n   - Check if this difference equals 14155.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - If the calculated difference is indeed 14155, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's perform these steps with the given data:\n\n- **VFL Park**: \n  - Row: 5 (0-indexed)\n  - Venue: \"vfl park\"\n  - Crowd: 15601\n\n- **MCG**:\n  - Row: 4 (0-indexed)\n  - Venue: \"mcg\"\n  - Crowd: 49756\n\n**Calculate the Difference**:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 49756 - 15601 = 34155 \\]\n\nThe claim states that there were 14155 fewer people at VFL Park than at MCG.
