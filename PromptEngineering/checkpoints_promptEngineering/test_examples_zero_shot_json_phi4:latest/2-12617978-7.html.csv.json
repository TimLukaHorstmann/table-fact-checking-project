    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant parts of the table for the specific episode mentioned in the claim.\n\n**Claim Analysis:**\n- The claim states: \"Richard Farleigh be 1 of 2 dragon invest in the August 17, 2006 episode of the Dragons' Den.\"\n\nWe need to verify:\n1. The episode aired on August 17, 2006.\n2. Whether Richard Farleigh is one of two investors (dragons) for that episode.\n\n**Table Examination:**\n- Locate the row corresponding to \"episode 3\" since it mentions \"17 august 2006\".\n- Check the \"first aired\" column to confirm the date.\n- Verify the \"investing dragon(s)\" column to see if Richard Farleigh is listed and whether there are exactly two investors.\n\n**Relevant Data from Table:**\n1. **Row Index 2 (Episode 3):**\n   - Column \"episode\": \"episode 3\"\n   - Column \"first aired\": \"17 august 2006\" (matches the date in the claim)\n   - Column \"investing dragon(s)\": \"richard farleigh\" (Richard Farleigh is listed as an investor)\n\n2. We need to confirm there are exactly two investors for this episode:\n   - Since the column \"investing dragon(s)\" only lists \"richard farleigh\", it implies he is the sole investor, not one of two.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The claim states Richard Farleigh is one of two investors, but the table shows he is the only investor for that episode.\n- Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"first aired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"investing dragon (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
