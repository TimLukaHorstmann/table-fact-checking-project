Only two golfers, Jack Nicklaus and Bobby Nichols, have exactly two under-par scores, meaning no golfer has achieved more than two under-par rounds.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
