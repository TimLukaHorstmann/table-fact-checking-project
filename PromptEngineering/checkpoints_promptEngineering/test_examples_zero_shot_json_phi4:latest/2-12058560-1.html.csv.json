This indicates that the Philadelphia Barrage scored 18 points.\n     - The game against \"machine\" happened on June 10th with a result of \"w 13 - 12 ot\", indicating that the Philadelphia Barrage scored 13 points.\n\n2. **Compare the Scores:**\n   - For \"riptide,\" the score was 18 points.\n   - For \"machine,\" the score was 13 points.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the Philadelphia Barrage scored fewer points against the \"riptide\" than they did against the \"machine\".\n   - From our comparison, they actually scored more points against \"riptide\" (18) than against \"machine\" (13).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the Philadelphia Barrage scored more points against \"riptide\" compared to \"machine\", the claim is false.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells from the table for verifying this claim are:\n     - Row index 1, column \"result\" for the game against \"riptide\".\n     - Row index 3, column \"result\" for the game against \"machine\".\n\nBased on the evaluation, here is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
