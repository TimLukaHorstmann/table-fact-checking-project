    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"the fullback Ken Snelling be pick 58 in round 7,\" we need to verify three specific conditions against the provided data:\n\n1. The player name should be \"Ken Snelling.\"\n2. The position should be \"fullback.\"\n3. The pick number should be 58, and it occurs in round 7.\n\nLet's examine each condition step-by-step using the JSON table provided:\n\n- **Condition 1: Player Name**  \n  We need to find if there is an entry where the player name is \"Ken Snelling.\" By examining the data rows:\n  - In row index 6 (0-based indexing), the player name is \"ken snelling,\" matching our condition.\n\n- **Condition 2: Position**  \n  Next, we verify that Ken Snelling's position is \"fullback\" in the same entry. Again, looking at row index 6:\n  - The position listed for this row is \"fullback.\"\n\n- **Condition 3: Pick and Round**  \n  Lastly, we check if the pick number is 58, occurring during round 7.\n  - In row index 6, the pick number is indeed 58, and it corresponds to round 7.\n\nSince all conditions are satisfied in row index 6, the claim is true. Now, let's specify which cells were relevant for verifying this claim:\n\n- The \"player\" cell from row index 6.\n- The \"position\" cell from row index 6.\n- The \"pick\" cell from row index 6.\n- The \"round\" cell from row index 6.\n\nThus, the JSON object reflecting our findings is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Thus, the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- We need to identify the specific cells that confirm both parts of the claim:\n  - For the position \"end,\" we look at column `position` at row index 23.\n  - For the school/club team \"oregon state,\" we check column `school / club team` at row index 23.\n\n### JSON Response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis response confirms that the claim is true and identifies the relevant cells used to verify it.",
