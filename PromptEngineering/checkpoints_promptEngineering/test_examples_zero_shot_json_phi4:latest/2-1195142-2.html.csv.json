    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"gary beach be 1 of 4 winner of a tony award\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to check two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. Verify if Gary Beach was nominated for a Tony Award.\n2. Check if Gary Beach won any Tony Awards.\n\nLet's analyze the table step by step:\n\n- The claim involves Gary Beach being one of the winners of a Tony Award in 2005.\n  \nFrom the table data:\n- In row index 1, we see that Gary Beach was nominated for \"best performance by a leading actor in a musical\" under the Tony Awards and received the result \"nominated\". This tells us he did not win.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row index 1, column name \"nominee\": checks who was nominated.\n- Row index 1, column name \"result\": verifies if the nominee won or not.\n\nSince Gary Beach is listed as \"nominated\" and not \"won\", the claim that he was a winner of a Tony Award is false.\n\nTherefore, the final JSON object with the answer and relevant cells is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
