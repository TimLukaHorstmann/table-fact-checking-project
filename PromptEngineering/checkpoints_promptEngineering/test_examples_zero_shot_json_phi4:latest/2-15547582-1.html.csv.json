    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to evaluate each condition specified in the claim against the data provided in the table.\n\n### Conditions from the Claim:\n1. **Industrial and Commercial Panel greater than 1**.\n2. **Nominated by the Taoiseach less than 11**.\n3. **Cultural and Educational Panel smaller than 0**.\n\nWe will analyze each party (row) to see if any satisfy all three conditions simultaneously:\n\n#### Row-by-Row Analysis:\n- **Fianna F\u00e1il**: \n  - Industrial and Commercial Panel = 3 (greater than 1)\n  - Nominated by the Taoiseach = 9 (less than 11)\n  - Cultural and Educational Panel = 3 (not smaller than 0)\n\n- **Fine Gael**:\n  - Industrial and Commercial Panel = 1 (not greater than 1)\n\n- **Labour Party**:\n  - Industrial and Commercial Panel = 0 (not greater than 1)\n\n- **Clann na Talmhan**:\n  - Industrial and Commercial Panel = 0 (not greater than 1)\n\n- **Clann na Poblachta**:\n  - Industrial and Commercial Panel = 0 (not greater than 1)\n\n- **Independent**:\n  - Industrial and Commercial Panel = 3 (greater than 1)\n  - Nominated by the Taoiseach = 0 (less than 11)\n  - Cultural and Educational Panel = 0 (equal to 0, not smaller than 0)\n\n- **Total**: This row is a summation and not applicable for individual conditions.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nNo party satisfies all three conditions simultaneously. Specifically, while the \"Independent\" party meets the first two conditions, it fails the third condition because its Cultural and Educational Panel value is 0, not smaller than 0.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE: there are no industrial and commercial panels with a labour panel greater than 1, nominated by the Taoiseach less than 11, and cultural and educational panel smaller than 0.\n\n#### Relevant Cells:\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are those that contain values for \"Industrial and Commercial Panel,\" \"Nominated by the Taoiseach,\" and \"Cultural and Educational Panel\" across all parties:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"industrial and commercial panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nominated by the taoiseach\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"cultural and educational panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"industrial and commercial panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"industrial and commercial panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"industrial and commercial panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"industrial and commercial panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"industrial and commercial panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nominated by the taoiseach\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"cultural and educational panel\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
