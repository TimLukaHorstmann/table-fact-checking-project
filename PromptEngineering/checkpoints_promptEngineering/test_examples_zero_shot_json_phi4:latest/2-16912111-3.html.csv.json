In row 14, it's 30 - 23, and that game was won by the home team.

It was actually 30 - 23.\n- The sequence and outcome of games (win one week before a loss) are correctly identified.\n\nSince the score in the claim does not match any recorded game, the entire claim cannot be considered fully accurate as per the table data.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze two specific parts based on the information provided in the table:\n\n1. **Claim about October 18 game against Calgary Stampeders**:\n   - The claim states that 30,110 fans attended a game at Calgary Stampeders.\n   - Check the row corresponding to \"oct 18\" and \"calgary stampeders\":\n     - Date: \"oct 18\"\n     - Opponent: \"calgary stampeders\"\n     - Attendance: \"30110\"\n\n2. **Claim about October 26 game against Montreal Alouettes**:\n   - The claim states that 20,102 fans attended a game at the Montreal Alouettes.\n   - Check the row corresponding to \"oct 26\" and \"montreal alouettes\":\n     - Date: \"oct 26\"\n     - Opponent: \"montreal alouettes\"\n     - Attendance: \"20202\"\n\nNow, let's evaluate whether these claims match with what is in the table:\n\n- For the October 18 game against Calgary Stampeders:\n  - The attendance is correctly noted as 30,110 in the row for that date and opponent.\n\n- For the October 26 game against Montreal Alouettes:\n  - The attendance is noted as 20,202, not 20,102 as claimed.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim about the attendance at the Calgary Stampeders game is true, but the claim about the attendance at the Montreal Alouettes game is false.
