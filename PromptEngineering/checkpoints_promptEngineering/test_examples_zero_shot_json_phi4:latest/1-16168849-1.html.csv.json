From the data, this corresponds to the institution named \"st andrews university\".\n\n2. **Find Enrollment Data**:\n   - The column that contains enrollment numbers is labeled \"enrollment\".\n   - For \"st andrews university\", we need to find its entry in this column.\n\n3. **Check the Relevant Row**:\n   - In the table, \"St Andrew's University\" appears as the 16th item (considering zero-based indexing).\n   - The enrollment number for \"st andrews university\" is listed as 600.\n\n4. **Verification**: \n   - Compare this value with the claim: the claim states that the enrollment should be 600.\n   - Since both match, the claim is supported by the data.\n\nThus, based on the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON response indicates that the enrollment number for St Andrew's University as given in the table is indeed 600, supporting the claim.

Whether this team joined a conference in the year 1965.\n\nLet's go through the relevant steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. **Identify the Row with Nickname \"Blue Hose\":**\n   - We need to look at the \"nickname\" column across all rows and find which institution has the nickname \"blue hose\".\n\n2. **Check the Year of Joining:**\n   - Once we identify the row, we check the \"joined\" column to see if it contains the year 1965.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each relevant entry:\n\n- Row with index 13 (Presbyterian College):\n  - Nickname is \"blue hose\".\n  - The \"joined\" column indicates \"1965\".\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are satisfied by Presbyterian College, we can conclude that the claim is true. The relevant cells for this verification are from row 13 in the \"nickname\" and \"joined\" columns.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"nickname\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"joined\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It is currently a member of the SAC.\n\nLet's examine each condition using the relevant columns from the data provided in the JSON format:\n\n- **Nickname (\"blue hose\")**:\n  - We need to find the row where the column \"nickname\" has the value \"blue hose.\"\n  \n- **Joined Year (1972)**:\n  - For the same row identified above, we check if the column \"joined\" contains the year 1972.\n  \n- **Current Conference (\"sac\")**:\n  - Finally, for this row, we verify that the \"current conference\" is listed as \"sac.\"\n\nNow, let's identify which rows meet these criteria:\n\n1. Look at the institution with the nickname \"blue hose.\" From the table data:\n   - Presbyterian College in Clinton, South Carolina has the nickname \"blue hose.\"\n   \n2. Check if Presbyterian College joined in 1972:\n   - The column \"joined\" for this row is listed as 1965.\n   \n3. Verify the current conference for Presbyterian College:\n   - The institution's \"current conference\" is recorded as \"big south (ncaa division i).\"\n\nSince the joined year for Presbyterian College does not match 1972 and its current conference is not SAC, it does not satisfy all conditions of the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is **FALSE**. \n\nHere are the relevant cells that were checked:\n\n- The row index for Presbyterian College is 13.\n- The column \"nickname\" confirms \"blue hose.\"\n- The column \"joined\" shows \"1965,\" which does not match the required year.\n- The column \"current conference\" indicates \"big south (ncaa division i),\" not SAC.\n\nThus, the JSON output reflecting these findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"nickname\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"current conference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
