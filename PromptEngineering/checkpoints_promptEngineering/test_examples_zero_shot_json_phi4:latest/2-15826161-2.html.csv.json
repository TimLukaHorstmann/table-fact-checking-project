    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the table data, we must verify each condition stated in the claim against the relevant cells of the provided JSON.\n\nThe claim states: \"france have 4 gold and 1 silver in the 1982 world judo championship with a total of 8.\"\n\nWe need to check:\n1. France's gold medals count.\n2. France's silver medals count.\n3. France's total medal count.\n\nAdditionally, we must ensure that this data corresponds specifically to \"the 1982 world judo championship,\" which is implied but not explicitly mentioned in the table. Since no information about the event year or type is given in the JSON data provided, we can only confirm the numerical counts without verifying the context of the event.\n\nLet's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **France's Gold Medals Count:**\n   - Look for France's row (rank 1).\n   - Check the \"gold\" column value.\n   - Relevant cell: Row index 0, Column name \"gold\".\n\n2. **France's Silver Medals Count:**\n   - Again, find France's row (rank 1).\n   - Check the \"silver\" column value.\n   - Relevant cell: Row index 0, Column name \"silver\".\n\n3. **France's Total Medal Count:**\n   - Locate France's row (rank 1).\n   - Verify the \"total\" column value.\n   - Relevant cell: Row index 0, Column name \"total\".\n\n4. **Event Context:**\n   - The claim specifies \"the 1982 world judo championship,\" but this detail is not present in the JSON data provided. Therefore, we cannot verify this condition with the given information.\n\nBased on available data:\n- France has 4 gold medals (cell [0, \"gold\"] = 4).\n- France has 1 silver medal (cell [0, \"silver\"] = 1).\n- France's total is 8 medals (cell [0, \"total\"] = 8).\n\nWhile all the numerical conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data, we lack information about the event being specifically \"the 1982 world judo championship.\" Thus, we cannot fully confirm the entire claim due to the absence of this contextual detail.\n\nTherefore, our answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
