    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to examine each row in the data section of the table and check for mentions of \"World War 1\" or \"wales\" within the \"notes\" column. \n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Row 0**:\n   - Note: \"ex dinorwic slate quarry, wales\"\n   - Mentions \"wales\"\n\n2. **Row 1**:\n   - Note: \"ex ww1 french artillery railways\"\n   - Mentions \"World War 1\" (abbreviated as \"ww1\")\n\n3. **Row 2**:\n   - Note: \"ex minas y ferrocarril de utrillas, aragon, spain\"\n   - No mention of either\n\n4. **Row 3**:\n   - Note: \"ex minas y ferrocarril de utrillas, aragon, spain\"\n   - No mention of either\n\n5. **Row 4**:\n   - Note: \"ex polish 2ft gauge\"\n   - No mention of either\n\n6. **Row 5**:\n   - Note: \"ex ww1 german feldbahn\"\n   - Mentions \"World War 1\" (abbreviated as \"ww1\")\n\n7. **Row 6**:\n   - Note: \"ex sena sugar estates, mozambique\"\n   - No mention of either\n\n8. **Row 7**:\n   - Note: \"ex dinorwic slate quarry, wales\"\n   - Mentions \"wales\"\n\nNow, let's count the mentions:\n\n- \"World War 1\" is mentioned in Row 1 and Row 5.\n- \"wales\" is mentioned in Row 0 and Row 7.\n\nBoth terms are mentioned twice.
