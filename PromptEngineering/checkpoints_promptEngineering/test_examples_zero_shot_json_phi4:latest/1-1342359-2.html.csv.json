    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"William B Oliver represents Alabama's 6th district,\" we need to identify relevant information in the table that confirms or refutes this statement.\n\n### Relevant Information from the Table:\n1. **District**: We need to verify if there is a row where the district is \"alabama 6\".\n2. **Incumbent**: Once we find \"alabama 6\", we should check if \"william b oliver\" is listed as the incumbent for that district.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n- Look through each row in the data section of the table.\n- Check the \"district\" column to find \"alabama 6\".\n- In the row where \"alabama 6\" appears, verify the \"incumbent\" column to see if it lists \"william b oliver\".\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Row Index 5**: The district is listed as \"alabama 6\", and the incumbent is \"william b oliver\".\n- This confirms that William B Oliver represents Alabama's 6th district.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is supported by the table data.

We will go through each row and note the year someone was first elected.\n   \n2. **Identify First Election Years**:\n   - Row 0: Year = 1918\n   - Row 1: Year = 1923\n   - Row 2: Year = 1914\n   - Row 3: Year = 1921\n   - Row 4: Year = 1928\n   - Row 5: Year = 1914\n\n3. **Determine the Most Recent First Election**:\n   - The first election years are 1918, 1923, 1914, 1921, 1928, and 1914.\n   - Among these, 1928 is indeed the latest year.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since no other row has a \"first elected\" year later than 1928, the claim is true.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - We need to provide all rows with their \"first elected\" column values as they are relevant for verifying the claim.\n   \nThe JSON response would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"first elected\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"first elected\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"first elected\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"first elected\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"first elected\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"first elected\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to examine each row in the table data and verify whether 1928 is indeed the first year mentioned where a candidate was elected.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim states that \"1928 be the first year that someone be elect\". This means we need to identify if any election or re-election (i.e., being elected) occurred before 1928 and confirm whether 1928 is indeed the earliest year mentioned in the table data where a candidate was elected.\n\n2. **Relevant Columns**:\n   - \"first elected\": Indicates when the incumbent was first elected.\n   - \"result\": Shows if the current election resulted in re-election.\n   - \"candidates\": Provides details on candidates and their results for the current election year, which can help confirm if an election took place.\n\n3. **Analyzing Each Row**:\n   - **Row 0**: \n     - First Elected: 1918\n     - Result: Re-elected\n     - This indicates that John McDuffie was elected in 1918.\n   \n   - **Row 1**:\n     - First Elected: 1923\n     - Result: Re-elected\n     - J Lister Hill was elected in 1923.\n\n   - **Row 2**:\n     - First Elected: 1914\n     - Result: Re-elected\n     - Henry B Steagall was elected in 1914.\n   \n   - **Row 3**:\n     - First Elected: 1921\n     - Result: Re-elected\n     - Lamar Jeffer's election occurred in 1921.\n\n   - **Row 4**:\n     - First Elected: 1928\n     - Result: Re-elected\n     - Lafayette L. Patterson was elected in 1928.\n   \n   - **Row 5**:\n     - First Elected: 1914\n     - Result: Re-elected\n     - William B. Oliver was elected in 1914.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   - We observe that elections occurred in the years 1914, 1918, 1921, and 1923 before 1928.\n   - Thus, 1928 is not the first year someone was elected according to this table; earlier years are present.\n\nThe claim \"1928 be the first year that someone be elect\" is FALSE.
