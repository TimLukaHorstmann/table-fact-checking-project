Typically, this would refer to a period from August 2002 to May 2003, focusing on competitive matches.\n\n2. **Venue and Match Outcome**:\n   - We are specifically interested in matches held at \"Easter Road\" (Edinburgh) as indicated by the claim.\n   - The match outcome should show Scotland winning (\"score\" where Scotland's score is greater than the opponent's).\n\n3. **Competition Type**: The claim refers to the football season, so we are primarily interested in competitive matches like ECQG5 and ECQPO rather than friendlies.\n\nNow let\u2019s evaluate the data:\n\n- We need to check for matches played at \"Easter Road\" with a victory for Scotland.\n- From the given table:\n  - There is only one entry that mentions \"Easter Road, Edinburgh (h)\" in row index 9.\n  - The competition type is \"friendly,\" and the score is \"4 - 1\", indicating a win for Scotland.\n\nNow let's check if there are any other matches at Easter Road or if this is the only match:\n\n- Reviewing all rows, we see that \"Easter Road\" appears once in row index 9.\n- There are no other entries for \"Easter Road\" as the venue in the entire table.\n\nSince Scotland did not beat Easter Road three times (it was only one time and it was a friendly match), the claim is false.

Identify all matches played at Hampden Park, Glasgow.\n2. Identify all matches played at Easter Road, Edinburgh.\n3. Compare the counts to see if matches at Easter Road occur 5 times more frequently.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Hampden Park, Glasgow:**\n- Look for entries where the \"venue\" is \"hampden park , glasgow (h)\".\n- Relevant rows:\n  - Row index 1: \"6 september\"\n  - Row index 3: \"11 october\"\n  - Row index 4: \"15 november\"\n  - Row index 5: \"19 november\"\n  - Row index 6: \"31 march\"\n\nThere are 5 matches at Hampden Park.\n\n**Easter Road, Edinburgh:**\n- Look for entries where the \"venue\" is \"easter road , edinburgh (h)\".\n- Relevant row:\n  - Row index 9: \"30 may\"\n\nThere is 1 match at Easter Road.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nScotland played at Hampden Park 5 times and at Easter Road 1 time.
