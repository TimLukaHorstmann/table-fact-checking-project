    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the first 3 of the 6 game be play over an 8 day period,\" we need to focus on the dates of the games and determine if the span from the first to the third game is within an 8-day range.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: The relevant column for this claim is \"date\" since it contains information about when each game occurred.\n\n2. **Extract Dates for the First Three Games**:\n   - Game 1: May 1\n   - Game 2: May 3\n   - Game 3: May 5\n\n3. **Calculate the Period Between the First and Third Game**:\n   - Start Date: May 1 (Game 1)\n   - End Date: May 5 (Game 3)\n\n4. **Determine the Number of Days Spanned**:\n   - From May 1 to May 5 is a span of 4 days.\n\n5. **Evaluate Against the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that these games should be played over an \"8 day period.\"\n   - Since 4 days is within an 8-day period, the claim holds true for this condition.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The claim is TRUE based on the data provided.\n\n7. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - We need to include the cells from the \"date\" column corresponding to the first three games.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row 0, Column \"date\"\n- Row 1, Column \"date\"\n- Row 2, Column \"date\"\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
