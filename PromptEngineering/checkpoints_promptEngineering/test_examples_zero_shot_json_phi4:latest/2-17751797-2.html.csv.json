Confirm that this score was achieved by Woking.\n\n### Steps for Evaluation\n\n**Step 1: Identify Relevant Data**\n\n- We are interested in the \"score\" column to check the points scored by each home and away team.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Game's Score**\n\nWe will parse through each game entry, extracting the score and identifying which team scored how many goals:\n\n1. **Game 1**: Chesterfield 3 - 4 Bolton Wanderers\n   - Chesterfield: 3 goals\n   - Bolton Wanderers: 4 goals\n\n2. **Game 2**: Bournemouth 1 - 0 Hayes\n   - Bournemouth: 1 goal\n   - Hayes: 0 goals\n   \n3. **Game 3**: Barnet 0 - 0 Northampton Town (Replay on 12/12)\n   - Barnet: 0 goals, then 1 goal in replay\n   - Northampton Town: 0 goals, then 0 goals in replay\n\n4. **Game 4**: Burnley 2 - 0 Stoke City\n   - Burnley: 2 goals\n   - Stoke City: 0 goals\n\n5. **Game 5**: Woking 5 - 1 Merthyr Tydfil\n   - Woking: 5 goals\n   - Merthyr Tydfil: 1 goal\n   \n6. **Game 6**: Crewe Alexandra 1 - 0 Atherstone United\n   - Crewe Alexandra: 1 goal\n   - Atherstone United: 0 goals\n\n7. **Game 7**: Shrewsbury Town 1 - 0 Chorley\n   - Shrewsbury Town: 1 goal\n   - Chorley: 0 goals\n\n8. **Game 8**: Wycombe Wanderers 1 - 1 Peterborough United (Replay on 17/12)\n   - Wycombe Wanderers: 1 goal, then 0 goals in replay\n   - Peterborough United: 1 goal, then 2 goals in replay\n   \n9. **Game 9**: Fulham 0 - 0 Cambridge United (Replay on 11/12)\n   - Fulham: 0 goals, then 1 goal in replay\n   - Cambridge United: 0 goals, then 2 goals in replay\n\n10. **Game 10**: Whitley Bay 0 - 1 Barrow\n    - Whitley Bay: 0 goals\n    - Barrow: 1 goal\n    \n11. **Game 11**: Scunthorpe United 3 - 2 Tranmere Rovers\n    - Scunthorpe United: 3 goals\n    - Tranmere Rovers: 2 goals\n\n12. **Game 12**: Huddersfield Town 0 - 2 Blackpool\n    - Huddersfield Town: 0 goals\n    - Blackpool: 2 goals\n    \n13. **Game 13**: Mansfield Town 2 - 1 York City\n    - Mansfield Town: 2 goals\n    - York City: 1 goal\n\n14. **Game 14**: Rotherham United 1 - 1 Halifax Town (Replay on 17/12)\n    - Rotherham United: 1 goal, then 2 goals in replay\n    - Halifax Town: 1 goal, then 1 goal in replay\n    \n15. **Game 15**: Aldershot 2 - 1 Maidstone United\n    - Aldershot: 2 goals\n    - Maidstone United: 1 goal\n\n16. **Game 16**: Swansea City 2 - 1 Walsall\n    - Swansea City: 2 goals\n    - Walsall: 1 goal\n    \n**Step 3: Determine the Highest Score**\n\nFrom the analysis above, the highest number of goals scored by a team in any single game is 5, achieved by Woking against Merthyr Tydfil.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are met. Therefore, the claim that \"the most point score by a team in a single game be 5, by Woking\" is true.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table include:\n\n- The row where Woking scored 5 goals (row index 4), particularly focusing on the \"score\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Each of these rows will indicate which team won in a replay match and whether it was considered an away win for the team listed first (in the \"home team\" column).\n\nLet's analyze each replay game:\n\n1. **Replay 1**: \n   - Home Team: Northampton Town\n   - Score: 0 - 1\n   - Away Team: Barnet\n\n   The home team, Northampton Town, lost to Barnet (the away team), so this is an away win.\n\n2. **Replay 2**:\n   - Home Team: Peterborough United\n   - Score: 2 - 0\n   - Away Team: Wycombe Wanderers\n   \n   The home team, Peterborough United, won against Wycombe Wanderers (the away team), so this is not an away win.\n\n3. **Replay 3**:\n   - Home Team: Cambridge United\n   - Score: 2 - 1\n   - Away Team: Fulham\n\n   The home team, Cambridge United, won against Fulham (the away team), so this is not an away win.\n\n4. **Replay 4**:\n   - Home Team: Halifax Town\n   - Score: 1 - 2\n   - Away Team: Rotherham United\n\n   The home team, Halifax Town, lost to Rotherham United (the away team), so this is an away win.\n\n5. **Replay 5**:\n   - Home Team: Leyton Orient\n   - Score: 4 - 1\n   - Away Team: Colchester United\n   \n   The home team, Leyton Orient, won against Colchester United (the away team), so this is not an away win.\n\n6. **Replay 6**:\n   - Home Team: Chester City\n   - Score: 4 - 0\n   - Away Team: Leek Town\n\n   The home team, Chester City, won against Leek Town (the away team), so this is not an away win.\n\nNow, we tally the results of these replay matches to see if a majority were won by the away teams:\n\n- Total replays analyzed: 6\n- Replays won by away teams: 2 (Replay 1 and Replay 4)\n- Replays not won by away teams: 4\n\nSince only 2 out of 6 replay games were won by the away team, a majority did not win.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the scores in the table and verify if the highest point score by a team in a single game was indeed 5 points, attributed to \"leek town\".\n\n### Steps for Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Score Column:** \n   The relevant column that contains the information about each team's score is labeled as \"score\". This column shows the home and away scores in the format \"home_score - away_score\".\n\n2. **Iterate Through Each Row:**\n   We will go through each row under the \"data\" section to find out the maximum points scored by any team.\n\n3. **Extract Home and Away Scores:** \n   For each match, extract the home score (first number before the dash) and the away score (second number after the dash).\n\n4. **Check for Maximum Score:**\n   Compare each extracted score with our current highest score found to see if it's larger than any previously checked scores.\n\n5. **Verify \"leek town\" Involvement:** \n   Specifically check if \"leek town\" is involved in a match where they scored 5 points, as the claim suggests this scenario.\n\n### Checking Each Entry:\n\n- Row indices from 0 to 20 represent matches.\n- We are particularly interested in entries under the \"score\" column.\n  \nLet's examine the scores for each relevant row:\n\n1. **Row 4 (\"wycombe wanderers\")** - Score: 1 - 1\n2. **Row 5 (\"woking\")** - Score: 5 - 1 (highest score observed is 5 by \"woking\")\n3. **Rows containing replays are not considered for this claim as they are separate matches and the claim refers to a single game scenario.**\n4. **Continue checking other rows similarly...**\n\n### Relevant Matches:\n\n- In row 5, \"woking\" scored 5 points against \"merthyr tydfil\", which is higher than any score achieved by \"leek town\".\n- \"Leek town\" had matches with scores:\n  - Row 18: Score 1 - 1\n  - Replay (Row 19): Chester city won 4 - 0\n\nNo match involves \"leek town\" scoring 5 points.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that the highest score by a team in a single game is 5, and it was achieved by \"leek town\", is false.
