We have confirmed through our analysis that this is accurate as 48883 is the smallest number in the attendance column.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - Based on our examination, the relevant cell where this minimum attendance occurs is at row index 14 (15th entry if starting from zero).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is supported by the data because the lowest recorded attendance figure is 48883, and it matches the value specified in the claim.

The highest attendance for a Cowboys game was 85,112.\n2. This high attendance occurred at an away game in Washington.\n3. The best-attended home game had just 64,104 fans.\n\nLet's verify these conditions one by one using the provided table data:\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Condition 1 and 2: Highest Attendance**\n- We look for the highest attendance figure in the \"attendance\" column:\n  - The figures are: 61,521; 63,430; 66,621; 61,535; 63,941; 63,114; **85,112**; 78,673; 69,010; 63,204; 64,104; **85,112**; 61,821; 63,366; 48,883; 64,366; 77,512.\n- The highest attendance is indeed 85,112.\n\n- We check which game(s) had this attendance:\n  - Date: December 2, 2001\n    - Opponent: Washington Redskins\n    - Result: W 20 - 14\n    - Attendance: 85,112\n\n**Condition 3: Best Attended Home Game**\n- To determine home games, we assume that if the team mentioned first is not known to be playing at their home stadium based on usual schedules or conventions (e.g., Cowboys), it's an away game.\n- Here, no explicit indication of \"home\" or \"away\" is given. However, typically for these datasets, if no opponent name suggests a neutral site, the team listed first can be assumed to be playing at home unless otherwise known.\n  \n- The highest attendance recorded that isn't confirmed as an away match in Washington is 64,104 on November 22, 2001:\n  - Date: November 22, 2001\n    - Opponent: Denver Broncos\n    - Result: L 26 - 24\n    - Attendance: 64,104\n\n- This game can be assumed as a home game since the Cowboys are not playing against the Washington Redskins.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is TRUE because:\n- The highest attendance was indeed 85,112 at an away game in Washington.\n- The best-attended home game had 64,104 fans.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- For the highest attendance (row index 11), columns \"date\", \"opponent\", \"result\", and \"attendance\" are relevant.\n- For the best-attended home game (row index 10), columns \"date\", \"opponent\", \"result\", and \"attendance\" are relevant.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
