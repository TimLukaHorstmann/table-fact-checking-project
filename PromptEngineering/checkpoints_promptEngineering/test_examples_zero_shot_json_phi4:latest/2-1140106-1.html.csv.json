    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the data in the table regarding Jack Brabham's performance across all races listed for the given season.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Total Races:**\n   - Count the total number of races listed in the \"data\" array. There are 10 races in total.\n\n2. **Count Wins by Jack Brabham:**\n   - Look at each row to identify which driver won each race, focusing on the \"winning driver\" column.\n   - Count how many times Jack Brabham is mentioned as the winning driver.\n\n3. **Calculate Half of Total Races:**\n   - Calculate half of the total number of races (10). Half of 10 is 5.\n\n4. **Compare Wins to Half of Total Races:**\n   - Check if Jack Brabham's wins equal or exceed 5, which would mean he won at least half of the races.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Races and Jack Brabham's Wins:**\n\n  1. Argentine Grand Prix: Winning Driver = Bruce McLaren\n  2. Monaco Grand Prix: Winning Driver = Stirling Moss\n  3. Indianapolis 500: Not part of F1, so not counted.\n  4. Dutch Grand Prix: Winning Driver = Jack Brabham\n  5. Belgian Grand Prix: Winning Driver = Jack Brabham\n  6. French Grand Prix: Winning Driver = Jack Brabham\n  7. British Grand Prix: Winning Driver = Jack Brabham\n  8. Portuguese Grand Prix: Winning Driver = Jack Brabham\n  9. Italian Grand Prix: Winning Driver = Phil Hill\n  10. United States Grand Prix: Winning Driver = Stirling Moss\n\n- **Wins by Jack Brabham:** \n  - He won the Dutch, Belgian, French, British, and Portuguese Grands Prix.\n  - Total wins = 5.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nJack Brabham won exactly half of the races (5 out of 10).

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"all but one race in the 1960 season was held at a different circuit,\" we need to examine the \"circuit\" column for each race entry and check if all races occurred at unique locations, except for one.\n\nHere is how we can verify this:\n\n1. **Extract Circuits:** We will list the circuits mentioned in the table.\n2. **Count Occurrences:** Determine how many times each circuit appears.\n3. **Check Uniqueness:** Identify if only one circuit has been repeated while all others are unique.\n\nLet's go through the data step-by-step:\n\n- **Buenos Aires** (Argentine Grand Prix)\n- **Monaco** (Monaco Grand Prix)\n- **Indianapolis** (Indianapolis 500)\n- **Zandvoort** (Dutch Grand Prix)\n- **Spa - Francorchamps** (Belgian Grand Prix)\n- **Reims** (French Grand Prix)\n- **Silverstone** (British Grand Prix)\n- **Boavista** (Portuguese Grand Prix)\n- **Monza** (Italian Grand Prix)\n- **Riverside** (United States Grand Prix)\n\nNext, let's count the occurrences of each circuit:\n\n1. Buenos Aires: 1\n2. Monaco: 1\n3. Indianapolis: 1\n4. Zandvoort: 1\n5. Spa - Francorchamps: 1\n6. Reims: 1\n7. Silverstone: 1\n8. Boavista: 1\n9. Monza: 1\n10. Riverside: 1\n\nEvery circuit appears exactly once, meaning there are no repeated circuits. The claim specifies that \"all but one race\" should be at different circuits, implying one repeat is allowed.\n\nSince all the circuits listed are unique and none of them repeats, the condition for having only one circuit with multiple races does not hold true. Thus, we have zero repetitions, which means more than one (specifically, all) races occur at different circuits.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"all but one race in the 1960 season was held at a different circuit\" is FALSE because there are no repeated circuits.\n\nHere is the JSON object reflecting this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"circuit\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"circuit\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"circuit\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"circuit\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"circuit\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"circuit\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"circuit\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"circuit\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"circuit\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"circuit\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
