    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down the statement: \"john j douglas represent a single district : massachusetts 10\". The key components of this claim are:\n\n1. **Name Verification**: Check if there is an incumbent named \"john j douglas\" in the table.\n2. **District Verification**: Verify that this person represents the district \"massachusetts 10\".\n\n**Relevant Cells to Check:**\n\n- We need to check each row for the \"district\", \"incumbent\", and possibly other related columns to ensure accurate verification.\n\n### Checking the Table:\n\n1. **Row Index 3**:\n   - **District**: \"massachusetts 10\"\n   - **Incumbent**: \"john j douglass\" (Note: The claim has a slight spelling difference with \"j douglas\" instead of \"j douglass\")\n\n2. **Relevance to the Claim**:\n   - The district matches (\"massachusetts 10\").\n   - The incumbent name is almost identical but slightly different in spelling. Assuming this is a typo, we consider it relevant.\n\nGiven these checks, the claim is supported by the data in row index 3 with the slight assumption that \"john j douglas\" was intended to be \"john j douglass\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is true based on the available data and assuming the minor spelling discrepancy is an error. The relevant cells are from row index 3, specifically for the \"district\" and \"incumbent\" columns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"district\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"incumbent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the result of the election feature James A Gallivan (D) unopposed be not re-elected.\" \n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: \n   - We are interested in any row where the candidate is \"James A Gallivan\" and his party affiliation is \"democratic\".
