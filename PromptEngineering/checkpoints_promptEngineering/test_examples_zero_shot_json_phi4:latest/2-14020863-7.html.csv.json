If he is not listed under round 3 but appears elsewhere, his inclusion in the list for this specific round must be false.\n\n6. **Cross-Verification**:\n   - Confirm that none of these players are from Canada according to their \"nationality\" values.\n\n7. **Result Analysis**:\n   - Miloslav Guren (Czechoslovakia) and Martin Hohenberger (Austria) are indeed not Canadian.\n   - Niklas Anger, however, is listed under round 5, not round 3.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim that \"Miloslav Guren, Martin Hohenberger, and Niklas Anger\" were the three non-Canadian players selected in round 3 is incorrect.
