    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Stanford have a linebacker from Norco High School\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the data in the table and verify each condition of the claim against it.\n\n1. **Claim Analysis**:\n   - The claim involves checking for a player who fits all of these conditions:\n     1. The player is a \"linebacker\".\n     2. The player attended \"Norco High School\".\n     3. The player's college is \"Stanford\".\n\n2. **Relevant Columns from the Table**:\n   - We need to check three columns: \"position\", \"hometown\" (which includes high school), and \"college\".\n\n3. **Checking Each Player in the Data**:\n\n   Let's go through each row of data to see if any player satisfies all conditions.\n\n   - **Row 0**: Mario Edwards, Jr.\n     - Position: Defensive Line\n     - Hometown: Denton, Texas (Ryan High School)\n     - College: Florida State\n\n   - **Row 1**: Ellis McCarthy\n     - Position: Defensive Line\n     - Hometown: Monrovia, California (Monrovia High School)\n     - College: UCLA\n\n   - **Row 2**: Noah Spence\n     - Position: Defensive Line\n     - Hometown: Harrisburg, Pennsylvania (Bishop McDevitt High School)\n     - College: Ohio State\n\n   - **Row 3**: Tommy Schutt\n     - Position: Defensive Line\n     - Hometown: Glen Ellyn, Illinois (Glenbard West High School)\n     - College: Ohio State\n\n   - **Row 4**: Darius Hamilton\n     - Position: Defensive Line\n     - Hometown: Ramsey, New Jersey (Don Bosco Preparatory High School)\n     - College: Rutgers\n\n   - **Row 5**: Vince Biegel\n     - Position: Linebacker\n     - Hometown: Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin (Lincoln High School)\n     - College: Wisconsin\n\n   - **Row 6**: Scott Starr\n     - Position: Linebacker\n     - Hometown: Norco, California (Norco High School)\n     - College: Southern California\n\n     *Relevant to the claim but college is not Stanford.*\n\n   - **Row 7**: Noor Davis\n     - Position: Linebacker\n     - Hometown: Leesburg, Florida (Lessburg High School)\n     - College: Stanford\n     \n     *Relevant to part of the claim but high school is not Norco High School.*\n\n   - **Row 8**: Shaq Thompson\n     - Position: Defensive Back\n     - Hometown: Sacramento, California (Grant Union High School)\n     - College: Washington\n\n   - **Row 9**: Landon Collins\n     - Position: Defensive Back\n     - Hometown: Geismar, Louisiana (Dutchtown High School)\n     - College: Alabama\n\n   - **Row 10**: Leon McQuay III\n     - Position: Defensive Back\n     - Hometown: Seffner, Florida (Armwood High School)\n     - College: Southern California\n\n   - **Row 11**: Tracy Howard\n     - Position: Defensive Back\n     - Hometown: Miramar, Florida (Miramar High School)\n     - College: Miami (FL)\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - No player in the data satisfies all three conditions of being a \"linebacker\", from \"Norco High School\", and attending \"Stanford\". Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - For the verification process, we need the cells related to Scott Starr (row 6) for his position, high school, and college; and Noor Davis (row 7) for his position and college.\n   \nHere's the JSON object representing the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"hometown\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"hometown\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
