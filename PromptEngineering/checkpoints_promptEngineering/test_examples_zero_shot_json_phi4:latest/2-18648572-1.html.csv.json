    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the attendance on specific dates is true or false, we need to focus on the relevant data in the table:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - The claim involves comparing attendance figures for two specific dates:\n     - October 14, 1973\n     - November 18, 1973\n\n2. **Locate Data for Each Date:**\n   - For October 14, 1973, refer to row 4 in the data array.\n   - For November 18, 1973, refer to row 10 in the data array.\n\n3. **Extract Attendance Figures:**\n   - From row 4 (October 14, 1973), extract the attendance value:\n     - Attendance = 51,107\n   - From row 10 (November 18, 1973), extract the attendance value:\n     - Attendance = 78,358\n\n4. **Compare Attendance Figures:**\n   - The claim states that the attendance on October 14, 1973, should be more than on November 18, 1973.\n   - Compare the figures: 51,107 (October 14) vs. 78,358 (November 18).\n   - Clearly, 51,107 is not greater than 78,358.\n\n5. **Determine Claim Validity:**\n   - Since the attendance on October 14, 1973, is less than that on November 18, 1973, the claim is false.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - The relevant cells are:\n     - Row 4, \"attendance\" (51,107)\n     - Row 10, \"attendance\" (78,358)\n\nBased on this analysis, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
