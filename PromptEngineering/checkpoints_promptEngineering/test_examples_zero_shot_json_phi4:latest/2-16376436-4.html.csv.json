The claim is:\n\n\"In game 17, the Los Angeles Raider play the San Diego Charger with a score of W 17 - 12 and attendance 62593.\"\n\nLet's break down each part of this claim and find the relevant information from the JSON table.\n\n1. **Game Number**: The claim refers to \"game 17\". We need to identify row 16 in the data (since rows are typically zero-indexed) that corresponds to week 17.\n   \n2. **Teams Involved**:\n   - Home Team: Los Angeles Raiders\n   - Opponent: San Diego Chargers\n\n3. **Result**: The result should be a win for the home team with a score of \"W 17 - 12\".\n\n4. **Attendance**: The attendance number should be 62593.\n\nNow, let's examine the data in row 16:\n\n- Row Index (zero-based): 16\n- Week: 17\n- Date: December 30, 1990\n- Opponent: San Diego Chargers\n- Result: W 17 - 12\n- Attendance: 62593\n\nNext, we need to verify the home team name in the dataset. The table does not explicitly mention \"Los Angeles Raiders\" as the home team but lists them as playing against the opponent listed (San Diego Chargers). Based on historical context, it is reasonable to infer that since they are listed first and won the game, the Los Angeles Raiders were indeed the home team.\n\nEach condition of the claim matches with data from row 16:\n\n- The teams involved match the claim.\n- The result \"W 17 - 12\" matches exactly.\n- The attendance number 62593 is correct.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are verified against the table and found to be true.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification in this JSON dataset are from row 16 with column names: \"week\", \"opponent\", \"result\", and \"attendance\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

This indicates a loss by the home team, as they scored 9 points.\n   \n2. **Week Number Check**:\n   - The relevant week number should be 10.\n\n3. **Opponent Team Check**:\n   - The opponent mentioned in the claim is \"San Diego Chargers\".\n\n### Verification with Table Data:\n\nLet's go through the table data row by row to find a match for all three conditions:\n\n- **Row 9**: \n  - Week: 9, Date: November 4, 1990\n  - Opponent: Kansas City Chiefs\n  - Result: l 9 - 7 (Score matches)\n  - Attendance: 70951\n\n- **Row 10**:\n  - Week: 10, Date: November 11, 1990\n  - Opponent: Green Bay Packers\n  - Result: l 29 - 16\n  - Attendance: 50855\n\n- **Row 12**:\n  - Week: 12, Date: November 25, 1990\n  - Opponent: Kansas City Chiefs\n  - Result: l 27 - 24\n  - Attendance: 65710\n\n- **Row 8 (missing from sequence, assumed to be week 8)**:\n  - Data for this row is missing in the provided table, but it should have been checked if present.\n\nNone of these rows meet all three conditions simultaneously. Specifically, there is no entry with a score of \"9 - 7\" where the opponent is \"San Diego Chargers\" and occurs during week 10.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is **FALSE** because there is no match for all specified conditions in the table data.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 9: \n  - Column: \"result\", Value: \"l 9 - 7\"\n  \nSince only this row had a score of \"9 - 7\" but did not meet all other criteria, it's relevant to include it for verification purposes.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: Row index is assumed as 8 because the row number in sequence is missing (it should be week 8), but this cell was checked to validate the score condition.",

    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim about weeks 8 and 10 in the provided table, we need to verify whether there are entries for these specific weeks indicating a game or opponent.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Understanding the Table Structure:**\n   - The table is represented as JSON with columns `week`, `date`, `opponent`, `result`, and `attendance`.\n   - Each entry in the data array represents a game, indexed by its row number starting from 0.\n\n2. **Checking for Week 8:**\n   - We need to find if there's any entry where `week` is equal to 8.\n   - Scanning through the provided data:\n     - The entries do not include a week number of 8.\n   - This confirms that week 8 does not have a game or opponent listed.\n\n3. **Checking for Week 10:**\n   - We need to find if there's any entry where `week` is equal to 10.\n   - From the data:\n     - There is an entry at row index 9 with `week = 10`.\n     - This entry includes a date (`\"november 11 , 1990\"`), opponent (`\"green bay packers\"`), result (`\"l 29 - 16\"`), and attendance (`50855`).\n   - Thus, week 10 does have a game listed.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that both weeks 8 and 10 did not have games or opponents.\n   - We found no entry for week 8 (consistent with the claim).\n   - However, there is an entry for week 10, contradicting the claim.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells to Verify:**\n   - For week 8: Since no row contains `week = 8`, this implicitly supports the absence of games.\n   - For week 10:\n     - Row index 9 has relevant information under columns `week`, `date`, `opponent`, and `result`.\n\nBased on the analysis, the claim is **FALSE** because there is an entry for week 10.
