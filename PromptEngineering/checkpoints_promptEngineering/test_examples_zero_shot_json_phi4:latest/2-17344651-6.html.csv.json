We need to identify games played at home (Brendan Byrne Arena or Boston Garden) by the Boston Celtics.\n2. Among these, find the games specifically against the New York Knicks.\n3. Check if all such identified games resulted in wins for the Boston Celtics.\n\n### Relevant Data from Table\n\n#### Column Relevance:\n- **Opponent**: To identify games against the \"New York Knicks.\"\n- **Score**: To determine the outcome of the game (who won).\n- **Location**: To check if it was a home game (Brendan Byrne Arena or Boston Garden).\n\n#### Data Review:\n\n1. **Row 2**:\n   - Opponent: New York Knicks\n   - Score: 105 - 94 (Boston wins)\n   - Location: Boston Garden (Home game)\n\n2. **Row 3**:\n   - Opponent: New York Knicks\n   - Score: 108 - 97 (New York wins)\n   - Location: Madison Square Garden (Not a home game for Boston)\n\n### Verification:\n\n- In Row 2, the game against the New York Knicks was played at home in Boston and resulted in a win for Boston.\n- In Row 3, even though it involved the New York Knicks, it was an away game for Boston, hence not relevant to the claim.\n\nThe only relevant home game against the New York Knicks is Row 2, which Boston won. Since there are no other home games against the Knicks that resulted in a loss, the claim holds true based on the data provided.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is supported by the table as all identified home games against the New York Knicks were indeed wins for the Boston Celtics.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The team involved is the Boston Celtics.\n2. The opponent is the Detroit Pistons.\n3. We need to find out if the highest score achieved by the Celtics was against the Pistons.\n\nSteps to verify:\n\n1. **Identify Games Involving the Boston Celtics:**\n   - All entries in the table are games played by the Boston Celtics, as indicated by the \"record\" column and the \"location\" being \"boston garden\" for most games.\n   \n2. **Find the Game Against the Detroit Pistons:**\n   - Look for the row where the opponent is \"detroit pistons\". This corresponds to:\n     - Row index 14 (0-based) with the game score of \"131 - 130\".\n\n3. **Determine if This is the Highest Score:**\n   - Compare this score (\"131\") against all other scores in the \"score\" column for the Boston Celtics.\n   - The scores are as follows:\n     - Row 0: 110\n     - Row 1: 105\n     - Row 2: 108\n     - Row 3: 111\n     - Row 4: 103\n     - Row 5: 119\n     - Row 6: 104\n     - Row 7: 86 (Celtics score)\n     - Row 8: 113\n     - Row 9: 97\n     - Row 10: 125\n     - Row 11: 128\n     - Row 12: 131 (against Pistons)\n     - Row 13: 104\n\n   - The highest score achieved by the Celtics is 131, which occurred in the game against the Detroit Pistons.\n\n4. **Verify the Season:**\n   - Although the table does not explicitly state the season, it includes games played from January 2 to January 30, which aligns with the NBA regular season schedule for early 1985.
