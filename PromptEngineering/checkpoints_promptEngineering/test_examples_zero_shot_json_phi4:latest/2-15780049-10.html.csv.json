    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim regarding the game on May 2:\n\n### Analyzing the Claim:\nThe claim states: \n- The high points for Toronto Raptors were Dell Curry (17).\n- The high rebounds were Antonio Davis (12).\n\nWe need to verify two conditions from the table:\n1. Whether Dell Curry scored 17 points in the May 2 game.\n2. Whether Antonio Davis had 12 rebounds in that same game.\n\n### Relevant Table Data:\nLooking at the row for May 2:\n\n| Game | Date   | Team     | Score       | High Points       | High Rebounds         | High Assists            | Location Attendance | Record |\n|------|--------|----------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|--------|\n| 5    | may 2  | detroit  | l 82 - 85 (ot) | dell curry (17)   | antonio davis (12)     | chris childs , alvin williams (6) | the palace of auburn hills 22076 | 2 - 3 |\n\n### Evaluation:\n- **High Points:** The table indicates that \"dell curry (17)\" scored the highest points, aligning with the claim.\n- **Team Check:** However, the game is listed under \"team: detroit,\" not Toronto Raptors. Therefore, Dell Curry's high score relates to the Detroit team, contradicting the claim about it being a Toronto Raptors player.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim that \"in the may 2 game, the high point for the toronto raptor be dell curry (17)\" is false because Dell Curry's points were attributed to the Detroit team. The part of the claim regarding rebounds by Antonio Davis is true as per the table but irrelevant due to the error in identifying the player's team.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
