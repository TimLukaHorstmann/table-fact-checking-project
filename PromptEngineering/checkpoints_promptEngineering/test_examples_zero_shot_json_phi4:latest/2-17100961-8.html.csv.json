This player's position is \"rb\".\n\nLet's break down these steps:\n\n- First, identify the row(s) where \"round\" equals 22. According to the data:\n  - Row at index 21: `[22, 3, 198, \"al cruver\", \"rb\", \"washington state\"]`\n\n- Next, check if the player picked in this round (row index 21) is indeed picked at position 8 as claimed by the question:\n  - In row 21, the \"pick\" value is 3. The claim specifies pick number 8.\n\nSince the player picked in round 22 was not selected with pick 8 but instead with pick 3, the condition of being \"pick 8\" does not hold true. Therefore, we can already conclude that the claim is false without needing to further verify the position for this specific pick number.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n- Row index 21 (to confirm round and pick).\n- Column \"round\".\n- Column \"pick\".\n\nBased on the above analysis, here's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"when the overall pick number be 38, the lowest pick number be 8.0.\"\n\nHere's how we can evaluate this:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row**: \n   - We need to find the row where the \"overall\" column has a value of 38.\n\n2. **Check the Corresponding \"pick\" Value**:\n   - Once we identify the row with an overall pick number of 38, we check the corresponding \"pick\" value to see if it is indeed 8.0 (or simply 8 since it's an integer).\n\n3. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - The claim specifies that when the overall pick is 38, the lowest pick should be 8.0. Since \"pick\" values are consistent across all rows at index 8 for each round, we only need to verify this condition once.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- From the data provided, locate the row where \"overall\" = 38:\n  - This is found in the third entry of the data array (index 2 in zero-based indexing).\n\n- Check the corresponding \"pick\" value for this row:\n  - In the same row, \"pick\" = 8.\n\nSince both conditions match the claim (\"overall\" is 38 and \"pick\" is 8), the claim is true.\n\nRelevant cells to verify the claim are from the row where \"overall\" is 38, specifically the columns \"overall\" and \"pick\".\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
