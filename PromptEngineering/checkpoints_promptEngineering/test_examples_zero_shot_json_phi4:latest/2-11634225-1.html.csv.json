    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim: \"beaversfv be 1 of 4 software program with various cost,\" we need to analyze the relevant data in the provided table.\n\n### Breakdown of the Claim:\n\n1. **Identify Software**: The claim specifically mentions \"beaversfv.\" We need to find this entry within the data.\n2. **Check Cost for BeaversFV**: According to the claim, beaversfv should have a cost listed as \"various.\"\n3. **Count Software with 'Various' Cost**: The claim states that there are 4 software programs with the cost labeled as \"various.\" We need to verify this count.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Locate BeaversFV in Table**:\n   - Row for beaversfv: \n     ```json\n     [\n       \"beaversfv\",\n       \"1.2\",\n       \"free\",\n       \"no\",\n       \"freeware\"\n     ]\n     ```\n   - The cost for beaversfv is \"free,\" not \"various.\" This already indicates the claim might be false.\n\n2. **Identify All Software with 'Various' Cost**:\n   - Scan through each row to find software entries where the cost is \"various.\"\n   - From the data provided, these are:\n     - Row 2: cdcheck (cost = various)\n     - Row 8: data digester (cost = various)\n     - Row 16: fastsum (cost = various)\n     - Row 29: teracopy (cost = various)\n\n3. **Count the Entries**:\n   - There are exactly 4 software programs with a cost labeled as \"various.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim is partially supported in that there are indeed 4 software programs with \"various\" costs.\n- However, beaversfv does not have a cost of \"various\"; it has a cost of \"free.\" Therefore, the specific condition about beaversfv being one of them is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"cost ( usd )\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"cost ( usd )\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"cost ( usd )\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"cost ( usd )\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"cost ( usd )\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to check each software entry in the table for its license type and see if it matches \"freeware.\" The claim specifically states that \"md5deep (and hashdeep)\" should be the only software with a \"freeware\" license. \n\nLet's examine the relevant entries:\n\n1. **md5deep (and hashdeep)**:\n   - License: \"public domain\"\n   \n2. We need to check all other software for any entries labeled as \"freeware.\"\n\nChecking through each row, we find the following software with a \"freeware\" license:\n\n- beaversfv\n- checksum compare\n- cobynsoft 's hash calculator\n- exactfile\n- express checksum calculator\n- fciv\n- febooti hash & crc\n- fsum\n- flashsfv (also has donationware)\n- ilsfv\n- intactfile\n- quicsfv\n- reksfv\n\nGiven that multiple software entries are labeled with a \"freeware\" license, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's list the relevant cells:\n\n1. **md5deep (and hashdeep)**:\n   - Row index: 20\n   - Column name: \"license\"\n\n2.
