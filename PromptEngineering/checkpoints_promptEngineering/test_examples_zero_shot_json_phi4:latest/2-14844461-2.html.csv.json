For comparison purposes, we'll treat \"rookie\" as 0 years.\n\nFrom the data:\n- \"nayef abi said\" and \"rudy hachach\" have played for \"7\" years, which is the maximum.\n- Other players have fewer years: a range from \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", or are \"rookie\".\n\n### Step 2: Check if These Players Are Also the Lightest\n- Now, we check their weights in the \"weight (kg)\" column for \"nayef abi said\" and \"rudy hachach\".\n- We need to find out if they are among the two lightest players overall.\n\nList of weights from all players:\n- 64 kg, 75 kg, 74 kg, 70 kg, 82 kg, 65 kg, 83 kg (rookie), 80 kg, 83 kg, 75 kg, 85 kg\n- 92 kg, 84 kg, 89 kg, 83 kg, 86 kg, 111 kg, 98 kg, 117 kg, 88 kg, 102 kg\n- 95 kg (rookie), 87 kg, 94 kg, 80 kg, 95 kg (rookie), 94 kg\n\nSorting these weights in ascending order gives:\n- 64 kg, 65 kg, 70 kg, 74 kg, 75 kg, 75 kg, 80 kg, 82 kg, 83 kg, 83 kg, 84 kg\n- 85 kg, 86 kg, 87 kg, 88 kg, 89 kg, 92 kg, 94 kg, 94 kg, 95 kg, 95 kg, 102 kg\n- 111 kg, 117 kg, 118 kg\n\nThe two lightest weights are:\n- 64 kg (allen khoury)\n- 65 kg (alaa khashab)\n\n### Conclusion\n- \"nayef abi said\" weighs 118 kg.\n- \"rudy hachach\" weighs 117 kg.\n\nNeither of these players is among the two lightest, as they are quite heavy compared to others.
