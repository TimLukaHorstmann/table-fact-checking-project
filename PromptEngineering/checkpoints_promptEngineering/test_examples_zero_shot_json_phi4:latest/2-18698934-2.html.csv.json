    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim \"none of the competition be friendly,\" we need to inspect each row in the data table and check if there is any occurrence where the competition is listed as \"friendly.\"\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step verification process:\n\n1. **Examine Each Row:** The relevant column for this task is the \"competition\" column, which indicates the type of competition for each match.\n\n2. **Check for 'Friendly' Competitions:**\n   - **Row 0 (Date: 20 June 2010):** \n     - Competition: \"2010 hong kong - macau interport\"\n     - This is not a \"friendly\" competition.\n   \n   - **Row 1 (Date: 2 November 2010):** \n     - Competition: \"friendly\"\n     - Here, the competition is indeed listed as \"friendly.\"\n     \n   - **Row 2 (Date: 26 January 2011):** \n     - Competition: \"friendly\"\n     - This match is also labeled as a \"friendly\" competition.\n   \n   - **Row 3 (Date: 9 February 2011):**\n     - Competition: \"friendly\"\n     - Again, this is another \"friendly\" competition.\n\n   - **Row 4 (Date: 3 June 2010):** \n     - Competition: \"friendly\"\n     - This row also lists the competition as \"friendly.\"\n\nSince there are multiple instances where the competition type is listed as \"friendly,\" the claim that \"none of the competition be friendly\" is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are those in the \"competition\" column across rows with \"friendly\" competitions. Specifically, these rows have indices 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
