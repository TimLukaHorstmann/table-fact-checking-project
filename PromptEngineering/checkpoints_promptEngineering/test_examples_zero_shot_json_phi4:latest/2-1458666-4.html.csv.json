    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to analyze each nation's data from the table with respect to their total wins and team wins.\n\nThe claim states: \"All 12 nations that have a win at the World Golf Championship have at least 1 team win.\"\n\nLet's break down the information from the table:\n\n- The table lists nations along with:\n  - `total wins` (sum of team and individual wins)\n  - `team wins`\n  - `individual wins`\n  - `individual winners`\n\nThe claim specifically focuses on \"at least 1 team win\" for all nations that have at least one total win.\n\nWe need to check each nation's row to see if they have any total wins (greater than or equal to 1) and verify if their team wins are at least 1. \n\nHere is the data analysis:\n\n1. **United States**: \n   - Total Wins: 32\n   - Team Wins: 1\n   - Relevant because it meets the condition.\n\n2. **Australia**:\n   - Total Wins: 5\n   - Team Wins: 0\n   - Fails the condition (no team wins).\n\n3. **England**:\n   - Total Wins: 5\n   - Team Wins: 1\n   - Meets the condition.\n\n4. **South Africa**:\n   - Total Wins: 4\n   - Team Wins: 2\n   - Meets the condition.\n\n5. **Northern Ireland**:\n   - Total Wins: 2\n   - Team Wins: 0\n   - Fails the condition (no team wins).\n\n6. **Germany**:\n   - Total Wins: 2\n   - Team Wins: 1\n   - Meets the condition.\n\n7. **Canada**:\n   - Total Wins: 1\n   - Team Wins: 0\n   - Fails the condition (no team wins).\n\n8. **Fiji**:\n   - Total Wins: 1\n   - Team Wins: 0\n   - Fails the condition (no team wins).\n\n9. **Sweden**:\n   - Total Wins: 1\n   - Team Wins: 0\n   - Fails the condition (no team wins).\n\n10. **Italy**:\n    - Total Wins: 1\n    - Team Wins: 0\n    - Fails the condition (no team wins).\n\n11. **Japan**:\n    - Total Wins: 1\n    - Team Wins: 1\n    - Meets the condition.\n\n12. **Wales**:\n    - Total Wins: 1\n    - Team Wins: 1\n    - Meets the condition.\n\nFrom this analysis, we observe that Australia, Northern Ireland, Canada, Fiji, Sweden, and Italy have at least one total win but do not have any team wins. Therefore, these nations contradict the claim.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells for verification are those involving `total wins` and `team wins` for each nation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"team wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"total wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"team wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"team wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"total wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"team wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"total wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"team wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"total wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"team wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
