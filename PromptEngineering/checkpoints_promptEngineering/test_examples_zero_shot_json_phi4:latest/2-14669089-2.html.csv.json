It was \"the tallest from year 1970 - 1973.\"\n\nLet's check these conditions:\n\n1. **Number of Floors:**\n   - We need to locate the entry for \"kwadukuza egoli hotel tower 1 , trust bank building\" in the table.\n   - According to the data:\n     - Row index 1 corresponds to \"kwadukuza egoli hotel tower 1 , trust bank building.\"\n     - The column \"floors\" has a value of 31 for this entry.\n\n2. **Tallest from 1970 - 1973:**\n   - We need to check if this building was the tallest during the years 1970 - 1973.\n   - The same row (index 1) shows:\n     - \"years as tallest\" is listed as \"1970 - 1973.\"\n     - The height in metres for this entry is 140.0, which is the tallest among all buildings listed for that period.\n\nNow, let's verify these conditions with relevant cells from the table:\n\n- For \"31 floors\":\n  - Row index: 1\n  - Column name: \"floors\"\n\n- For \"Tallest from 1970 - 1973\":\n  - Row index: 1\n  - Column name: \"years as tallest\"\n  - Additionally, we can verify by checking the height:\n    - Row index: 1\n    - Column name: \"metres\"\n\nAll conditions in the claim are supported by the data.

This makes the location part of the claim false.\n- **Number of Floors:** While the number of floors (50) matches the table data for the Carlton Centre, this does not validate the entire claim due to the incorrect city.\n\nGiven that the location aspect of the claim is incorrect, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells from the table:\n- The cell indicating the \"name\" and \"city\" for the \"Carlton Centre.\"\n- The cell indicating the number of \"floors\" for the \"Carlton Centre.\"\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"floors\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Carlton Centre: 732 feet\n  2. Kwadukuza Egoli Hotel Tower 1, Trust Bank Building: 459 feet\n  3. Standard Bank Building: 455 feet\n  4. Schlesinger Building: 361 feet\n  5.

Standard Bank Building (455 feet)\n  4. Schlesinger Building (361 feet)\n\n- The Schlesinger Building is the fourth tallest in Johannesburg, but only if it were correctly listed as 459 feet.\n\n#### Conclusion\n- The claim incorrectly states that the Schlesinger Building is 459 feet tall. It is actually 361 feet tall.\n- Therefore, based on its actual height, the Schlesinger Building would not be the fourth tallest building in Johannesburg.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"feet\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"feet\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"feet\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"feet\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"feet\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe relevant cells include the height of the Schlesinger Building and the heights of other Johannesburg buildings to determine its ranking.",
