Let's locate Assam:\n  - The data array shows Assam as the 16th entry (index 15).\n\n### Step 3: Verify Assam's Value for \"1990 - 95\"\n- For Assam, we check the value in the second column (\"1990 - 95\"):\n  - Entry: `[0.21]` matches the claim.\n\n### Step 4: Locate West Bengal's Row\n- Next, locate West Bengal:\n  - The data array shows West Bengal as the 17th entry (index 16).\n\n### Step 5: Verify West Bengal's Value for \"1990 - 95\"\n- For West Bengal, we check the value in the second column (\"1990 - 95\"):\n  - Entry: `[0.11]` matches the claim.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are verified to be true based on the table data, the overall claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n- Assam's relevant cell:\n  - Row index: 15\n  - Column name: \"1990 - 95\"\n- West Bengal's relevant cell:\n  - Row index: 16\n  - Column name: \"1990 - 95\"\n\nNow, we can construct the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"1990 - 95\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"1990 - 95\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify two parts of it against the provided table:\n\n1. **Gujarat's value for \"2001 - 05\":** \n   - The claim states that Gujarat had a value of 0.55 in this period.\n   - Locate the row corresponding to Gujarat in the data array and check the value under the column \"2001 - 05\".\n   - From the table, Gujarat corresponds to the second entry (index 1) in the `data` array:\n     ```json\n     [\n       \"gujarat\",\n       0.48,\n       0.57,\n       0.64,\n       0.69\n     ]\n     ```\n   - The value for \"2001 - 05\" is actually 0.64, not 0.55 as claimed.\n\n2. **Jammu & Kashmir's value for \"2001 - 05\":**\n   - The claim states that Jammu & Kashmir had a value of 0.17 in this period.\n   - Locate the row corresponding to Jammu & Kashmir in the data array and check the value under the column \"2001 - 05\".\n   - From the table, Jammu & Kashmir corresponds to the fifth entry (index 4) in the `data` array:\n     ```json\n     [\n       \"jammu & kashmir\",\n       0.13,\n       0.32,\n       0.17,\n       0.4\n     ]\n     ```\n   - The value for \"2001 - 05\" is indeed 0.17, which matches the claim.\n\nSince the first part of the claim about Gujarat is incorrect (the actual value is 0.64 instead of 0.55), the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, we identify the relevant cells:\n- For Gujarat's \"2001 - 05\", the row index is 1 and the column name is \"2001 - 05\".\n- For Jammu & Kashmir's \"2001 - 05\", the row index is 4 and the column name is \"2001 - 05\".\n\nHere is the JSON object with the result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2001 - 05\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2001 - 05\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
