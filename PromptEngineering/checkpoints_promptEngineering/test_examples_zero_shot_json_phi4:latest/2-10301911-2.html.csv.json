    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Brian Finch is true or false, we need to verify two conditions:\n\n1. **Rank Condition**: The claim states that Brian Finch's rank should be greater than 3.\n2. **Time Condition**: His finishing time should be \"2:14.59.0\".\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions using the provided table data.\n\n### Evaluation of Conditions\n\n**Condition 1: Rank Greater Than 3**\n\n- From the table, we find Brian Finch at row index 6 with a rank of 7.\n- Since 7 is indeed greater than 3, this condition is satisfied.\n\n**Condition 2: Time Equals \"2:14.59.0\"**\n\n- The time listed for Brian Finch at row index 6 is \"2:14.59.0\".\n- This matches the claim exactly.\n\nBoth conditions are met based on the table data. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells from the table that support this determination are:\n- Row index 6, column \"rank\" for verifying the rank condition.\n- Row index 6, column \"time\" for verifying the time condition.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to evaluate each part of the statement against the data in the table:\n\n1. **Rider: \"brian finch\"**\n   - According to the table, Brian Finch is indeed listed as a rider.\n\n2. **Team: \"suzuki\"**\n   - The team associated with Brian Finch is listed as \"velocette,\" not \"suzuki.\" This condition fails.\n\n3. **Rank greater than 3**\n   - Brian Finch has a rank of 7, which satisfies the condition of being greater than 3.\n\n4. **Time value: \"2:14.59.0\"**\n   - The time for Brian Finch is indeed listed as \"2:14.59.0\".\n\nSince one of the conditions (team) fails, the entire claim does not hold true. We need to identify the relevant cells that pertain to verifying this claim:\n\n- **Rider check**: Row index 6, column name \"rider\"\n- **Team check**: Row index 6, column name \"team\"\n- **Rank check**: Row index 6, column name \"rank\"\n- **Time check**: Row index 6, column name \"time\"\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"rider\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
