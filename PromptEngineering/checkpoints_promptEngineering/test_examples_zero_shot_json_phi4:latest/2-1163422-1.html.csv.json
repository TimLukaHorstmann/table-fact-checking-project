    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"evansville triplet baseball team be class aaa in the three - i league title 1946 , 1948 , 1956 , 1957 championship,\" we need to verify several aspects of it against the provided table:\n\n1. **Team Name**: The claim mentions \"evansville triplet.\" We need to find this team's row in the data.\n2. **Sport**: It specifies baseball, so we confirm that all entries are related to baseball teams.\n3. **Class and League**:\n   - The claim states the class is \"AAA.\"\n   - The claim also states the league was the \"Three-I League.\"\n4. **Championships**: The team is claimed to have championships in 1946, 1948, 1956, and 1957.\n\nLet's analyze each part:\n\n1. **Finding \"Evansville Triplets\"**:\n   - The table entry for \"evansville triplets\" appears at row index 12.\n   \n2. **Class**:\n   - According to the data, the class of \"evansville triplets\" is \"AAA,\" which matches part of the claim.\n\n3. **League**:\n   - The league listed for the \"evansville triplets\" is the \"American Association,\" not the \"Three-I League.\" This does not match the claim.\n\n4. **Championships**:\n   - The championships mentioned in the data for the \"evansville triplets\" are from 1972, 1975, and 1979.\n   - The years 1946, 1948, 1956, and 1957 are associated with \"evansville braves,\" not \"evansville triplets.\"\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n- The team \"Evansville Triplets\" is indeed class AAA but in the American Association, not the Three-I League.\n- The championships from 1946, 1948, 1956, and 1957 are linked to the \"Evansville Braves,\" not the \"Triplets.\"\n\nThe claim contains several inaccuracies regarding league and championship years.
