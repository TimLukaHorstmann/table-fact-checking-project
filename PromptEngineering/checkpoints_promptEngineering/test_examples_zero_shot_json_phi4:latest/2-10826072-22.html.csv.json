Thus, we need to check the \"crowd\" column in the same row where \"essendon\" is listed as the home team.\n\nLet's go through the data:\n\n- In the first row: \n  - Home Team: hawthorn\n  - Crowd: 14809\n\n- In the second row:\n  - Home Team: footscray\n  - Crowd: 16707\n\n- **In the third row** (this is where we find \"essendon\"):\n  - Home Team: essendon\n  - Crowd: 12865\n\n- In the fourth row:\n  - Home Team: carlton\n  - Crowd: 32000\n\n- In the fifth row:\n  - Home Team: south melbourne\n  - Crowd: 9307\n\n- In the sixth row:\n  - Home Team: richmond\n  - Crowd: 36423\n\nThe relevant data in the third row confirms that \"essendon\" was indeed the home team and had a crowd size of 12865, which matches the claim.\n\nTherefore, both conditions specified in the claim are satisfied.\n\nThe JSON response is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
