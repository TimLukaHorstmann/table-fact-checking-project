    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"apoel and videoton both have a score of 2 - 2 during an away game,\" we need to examine the relevant entries in the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim:\n1. We are looking for matches against \"apoel\" and \"videoton.\"\n2. For each match, the away result should be \"2 - 2.\"\n\nWe will check each relevant row:\n\n- **Apoel**:\n  - The entry in the table is: \n    ```\n    [\n      \"2011 - 12\",\n      \"uefa champions league\",\n      \"third qualifying round\",\n      \"apoel\",\n      \"0 - 2\",\n      \"0 - 0\",\n      \"0 - 2\"\n    ]\n    ```\n  - The away score for this match is \"0 - 0,\" not \"2 - 2.\"\n\n- **Videoton**:\n  - The entry in the table is: \n    ```\n    [\n      \"2012 - 13\",\n      \"uefa europa league\",\n      \"second qualifying round\",\n      \"videoton\",\n      \"1 - 1\",\n      \"0 - 0\",\n      \"1 - 1 ( a )\"\n    ]\n    ```\n  - The away score for this match is \"0 - 0,\" not \"2 - 2.\"\n\nSince neither apoel nor videoton have an away game with the score of \"2 - 2,\" the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells:\n- For Apoel, we look at the row where \"apoel\" is mentioned (row index 6) and check the \"away\" column.\n- For Videoton, we look at the row where \"videoton\" is mentioned (row index 11) and check the \"away\" column.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"away\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"away\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
