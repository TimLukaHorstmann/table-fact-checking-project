    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the San Antonio Spurs' scores is true or false, we need to evaluate their point totals in games played before December 19, 1976. Specifically, we must check if they scored less than 100 points in any game during this period.\n\nHere's a breakdown of each relevant game from the table:\n\n1. **December 2, 1976**: Scored 116 points\n   - Relevant cell: `data[0][\"score\"]`\n   \n2. **December 3, 1976**: Scored 105 points\n   - Relevant cell: `data[1][\"score\"]`\n\n3. **December 5, 1996**: Scored 98 points (less than 100)\n   - Relevant cell: `data[2][\"score\"]`\n\n4. **December 10, 1976**: Scored 136 points\n   - Relevant cell: `data[4][\"score\"]`\n\n5. **December 11, 1976**: Scored 121 points\n   - Relevant cell: `data[5][\"score\"]`\n\n6. **December 14, 1976**: Scored 111 points\n   - Relevant cell: `data[6][\"score\"]`\n\n7. **December 15, 1976**: Scored 102 points\n   - Relevant cell: `data[7][\"score\"]`\n\n8. **December 17, 1976**: Scored 101 points\n   - Relevant cell: `data[8][\"score\"]`\n\nFrom this evaluation, we observe that on December 5, 1976, the San Antonio Spurs scored 98 points, which is less than 100.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"the san antonio spur do not score less than 100 point during any game before december 19 , 1976\" is FALSE.\n\nNow let's compile this information into the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
