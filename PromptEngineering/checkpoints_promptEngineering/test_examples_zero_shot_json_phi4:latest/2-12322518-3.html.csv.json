    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"when arsenal be the opponent, the attendance record be the highest,\" we need to inspect the table and verify two conditions:\n\n1. Identify all rows where Arsenal is listed as the opponent.\n2. Check if these rows have the highest attendance compared to other games.\n\nLet's break this down step-by-step using the provided table data:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Rows with Arsenal as Opponent\nFrom the table:\n- The row index 3 corresponds to a match against Arsenal on \"8 march 2003\" at an away game, with an attendance of 38,104.\n- The row index 4 corresponds to a replay match against Arsenal on \"25 march 2003\" at home, with an attendance of 41,456.\n\n### Step 2: Compare Attendances\nNow, compare the attendances in these rows against all other matches:\n- Row 0 (Middlesbrough): Attendance = 2,796\n- Row 1 (Shrewsbury Town): Attendance = 7,950\n- Row 2 (Stoke City): Attendance = 26,615\n- Row 3 (Arsenal - Away): Attendance = 38,104\n- Row 4 (Arsenal Replay - Home): Attendance = 41,456\n\nThe highest attendance in the table is 41,456 for the match on \"25 march 2003\" at home against Arsenal.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim states that when Arsenal is the opponent, the attendance record should be the highest. We have verified that:\n- The match with the highest attendance (41,456) occurred when Arsenal was indeed the opponent.\n  \nThus, the claim is supported by the data in the table. \n\nHere's the relevant JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
