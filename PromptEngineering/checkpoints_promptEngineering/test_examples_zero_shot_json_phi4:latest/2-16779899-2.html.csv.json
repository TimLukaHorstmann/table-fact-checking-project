    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify several conditions based on the provided table:\n\n1. **Week Verification**: Check if the game in question occurs during week 15.\n2. **Date Verification**: Confirm that this game happens on December 14, 1986.\n3. **Result Verification**: Ensure that the result of the game is a loss with a score of 34 - 3.\n\nLet's analyze each condition using the relevant rows and columns from the table:\n\n- **Row Identification**: From the data, we locate the row corresponding to week 15:\n  ```json\n  [\n    14,\n    \"december 7 , 1986\",\n    \"new england patriots\",\n    \"w 31 - 7\",\n    60633\n  ],\n  [\n    15,\n    \"december 14 , 1986\",\n    \"cleveland browns\",\n    \"l 34 - 3\",\n    58062\n  ],\n  [\n    16,\n    \"december 21 , 1986\",\n    \"new york jets\",\n    \"w 52 - 21\",\n    51619\n  ]\n  ```\n  The game on December 14, 1986, is found in row index 15.\n\n- **Week Verification**: In row index 15, the column for \"week\" contains the value 15. This matches our requirement.\n  \n- **Date Verification**: In row index 15, the column for \"date\" confirms the date as \"december 14 , 1986\".\n\n- **Result Verification**: The same row (index 15) in the \"result\" column shows \"l 34 - 3\", which indicates a loss with the specified score.\n\nHaving verified all conditions and finding them consistent with the claim, we conclude that the claim is true. The relevant cells are:\n\n1. Row index 15, Column: week\n2. Row index 15, Column: date\n3. Row index 15, Column: result\n\nHere's the resulting JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
