However, since the table does not provide information about their NHL team affiliation during the 1976-77 season, we cannot verify the second condition.\n\nGiven this analysis, the claim is only partially supported by the data available in the table. Therefore, the answer is \"FALSE\".\n\nHere's the JSON output with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim about Mark Suzor and Dave Hynek playing for Kingston Canadians before joining the Philadelphia Flyers in the 1976-77 season, we need to examine relevant details from the table provided.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Identify Players:**\n   - We are interested in \"Mark Suzor\" and \"Dave Hynek.\"\n   \n2. **Check Clubs/Teams Before Joining the Flyers:**\n   - The claim specifies that both players played for the \"Kingston Canadians\" before joining the Philadelphia Flyers.\n   \n3. **Verify Data from Table:**\n\n   - For Mark Suzor:\n     - Row 0 shows he is listed as a player in \"round 1.\"\n     - His club/team is \"kingston canadians ( oha )\".\n   \n   - For Dave Hynek:\n     - Row 3 shows he is listed in \"round 4.\"\n     - His club/team is also \"kingston canadians (oha)\".\n     \n4. **Consider Historical Context:**\n   - Mark Suzor and Dave Hynek both played for the Philadelphia Flyers during the 1976-77 season, but this specific table does not mention their joining timeline relative to that season.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe table provides evidence that both players were associated with the Kingston Canadians before the claim's timeframe. While it doesn't explicitly confirm they joined the Flyers directly after playing for Kingston Canadians or in a particular order related to 1976-77, the information aligns with the requirement of being part of Kingston Canadians at some point prior to joining the Flyers.\n\nTherefore, based on the data provided and the context needed by the claim (regarding their association with Kingston Canadians), we can conclude that this aspect of the claim is supported. The precise timing relative to the 1976-77 season is not verifiable from the table alone but does not contradict the claim made in terms of club/team associations.\n\n### JSON Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"college / junior / club team (league)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"college / junior / club team (league)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
