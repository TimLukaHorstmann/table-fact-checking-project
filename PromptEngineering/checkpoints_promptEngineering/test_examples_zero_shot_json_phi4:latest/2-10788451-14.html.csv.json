    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if there exists a row in the data where the \"home team score\" matches \"11.15 (81)\" and simultaneously, the \"away team score\" matches \"8.12 (60)\". Let's break down this process step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: The relevant columns for checking the claim are \"home team score\" and \"away team score\".\n\n2. **Iterate Through Each Row**:\n   - We will go through each row in the data array, specifically examining the values under \"home team score\" and \"away team score\".\n   \n3. **Check Conditions**:\n   - For each row, we check if the \"home team score\" is \"11.15 (81)\".\n   - If it matches, then we further check if the \"away team score\" in the same row is \"8.12 (60)\".\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - Go through each row of data and apply the above checks:\n\n     - Row 0: \n       - Home team score = \"10.17 (77)\", Away team score = \"5.4 (34)\"\n       - Does not match conditions.\n     \n     - Row 1: \n       - Home team score = \"13.18 (96)\", Away team score = \"6.11 (47)\"\n       - Does not match conditions.\n\n     - Row 2:\n       - Home team score = \"9.19 (73)\", Away team score = \"13.12 (90)\"\n       - Does not match conditions.\n     \n     - Row 3: \n       - Home team score = \"14.12 (96)\", Away team score = \"11.17 (83)\"\n       - Does not match conditions.\n\n     - Row 4:\n       - Home team score = \"12.11 (83)\", Away team score = \"11.15 (81)\"\n       - Here, the home team score is close but does not exactly match \"11.15 (81)\".\n     \n     - Row 5: \n       - Home team score = \"8.12 (60)\", Away team score = \"12.22 (94)\"\n       - The away team score matches condition for a different home team score.\n\n   None of the rows satisfy both conditions simultaneously. \n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is no row where the home team score is \"11.15 (81)\" and at the same time, the away team score is \"8.12 (60)\", the claim is FALSE.\n   \n6. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells for checking the claim are from columns \"home team score\" and \"away team score\", specifically rows 0 through 5.\n\nHere is the JSON object representing the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
