    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"ashley grime be trade to millwall,\" we need to examine relevant details in the provided table about player transfers. Specifically, we'll focus on whether there is an entry for a player named Ashley Grimes who transferred to Millwall and check if it was a transfer.\n\n1. **Identify the Player:**\n   - The claim involves \"ashley grime,\" which seems to be a misspelling or variation of \"Ashley Grimes.\" We need to locate this name in the table.\n\n2. **Verify Transfer Details:**\n   - We should check if there is an entry for Ashley Grimes (or a similar name) with the destination club as Millwall.\n   - Additionally, confirm whether this transfer involved any fee or was free.\n\n3. **Relevant Table Columns:**\n   - The relevant columns to verify the claim are \"player,\" \"to club,\" and \"transfer fee.\"\n\n4. **Locate Relevant Entry:**\n   - Look for a row where:\n     - The player name is Ashley Grimes.\n     - The transfer destination (to club) is Millwall.\n\n5. **Verify Transfer Status:**\n   - Ensure that the transfer fee entry does not indicate \"released,\" as this would imply the player was not transferred to another club.\n\n**Examination of the Table Data:**\n\n- Row 4 contains:\n  - Player: Ashley Grimes\n  - To Club: Millwall\n  - Transfer Fee: Free\n\nThis row matches all conditions stated in the claim, confirming that Ashley Grimes was indeed traded (transferred) to Millwall for a free transfer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim is supported by the data provided in the table.
