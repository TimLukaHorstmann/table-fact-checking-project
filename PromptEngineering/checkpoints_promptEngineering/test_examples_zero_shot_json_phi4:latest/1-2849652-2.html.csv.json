This corresponds to the \"of divisions\" column in the table.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Identify rows where the season is \"winter.\"\n2. Among these, find the row corresponding to \"gymnastics.\"\n3. Check the value under the \"of divisions\" column for this row.\n\n### Table Analysis:\n- Row 5 matches our criteria: \n  - **Season**: Winter\n  - **Sport**: Gymnastics\n\nFor this row:\n- The \"of divisions\" value is 1, which matches the claim.\n  \nThus, the claim that \"winter gymnastics have 1 division in the 2011 - 2012 state tournament\" is supported by the data.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are from Row 5, specifically in the columns \"season,\" \"sport,\" and \"of divisions.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"sport\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"of divisions\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Therefore, it is impossible to have any division count for that year.\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe claim is FALSE because there are no winter season entries in the year 1978 in the table.\n\n#### Relevant Cells:\nSince the claim involves checking specific conditions (winter season and year 1978), we only consider the relevant columns (`season` and `1st tournament`) to verify the absence of such an entry.
