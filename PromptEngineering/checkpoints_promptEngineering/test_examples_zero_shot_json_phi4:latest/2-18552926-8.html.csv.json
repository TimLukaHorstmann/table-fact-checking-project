Among those, find an entry with the role/episode as \"fox multer\" and determine its year.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant data from the table:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Year: 1996\n  - Result: Won\n  - Role / Episode: Fox Mulder\n  \n  This row does not satisfy the condition since the result is \"won\".\n\n- **Rows 2 to 9**:\n  - All these rows have a result of either \"nominated\" or pertain to different roles/episodes without matching both conditions.\n\nFrom this analysis, we observe that there are no entries where the role/episode is \"fox mulder\" and the result is \"nominated\". The only instance with \"fox mulder\" is in 1996 but has a result of \"won\".\n\nThus, the claim is not supported by any data in the table.
