    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if the statement about round 7 and \"67 the racer's group with the fastest lap\" is supported by the data in the table.\n\n### Steps for Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We focus on Round 7 from the table.\n   - Specifically, we look at the entries corresponding to each column in that row to see if \"67 the racer's group\" appears with a notable distinction like having the fastest lap.\n\n2. **Check Round 7 Entries:**\n   - From the given data for Round 7:\n     ```\n     [10, \"montreal\", \"99 gainsco / bob stallings racing\", \"99 gainsco / bob stallings racing\", \"10 suntrust racing\", \"results\"]\n     [10, \"montreal\", \"jon fogarty alex gurney\", \"jon fogarty alex gurney\", \"max angelelli brian frisselle\", \"results\"]\n     [10, \"montreal\", \"87 farnbacher loles racing\", \"30 racers edge motorsports\", \"57 stevenson motorsports\", \"results\"]\n     [10, \"montreal\", \"leh keen dirk werner\", \"tom sutherland dane cameron\", \"andrew davis robin liddell\", \"results\"]\n     ```\n\n3. **Check for \"67 the racer's group\":**\n   - None of these entries mention \"67 the racer's group\". \n   - Therefore, there is no indication in Round 7 that \"67 the racer's group\" had any special note or was recorded with a fastest lap distinction.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since \"67 the racer's group\" does not appear in any of the entries for Round 7, and there is no mention of it having the fastest lap, the claim cannot be supported by the data provided.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\nThe claim is false based on the absence of relevant information. Thus, we construct the following JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Track Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"1st Place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"2nd Place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"3rd Place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Results\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON response includes the row index for Round 7 (indexing starts from 0), showing where we checked the relevant columns to verify the claim.",

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"1 race have 99 gainsco / bob stalling racing in pole position in round 10,\" we need to examine the data from the table related to round 10 and check if \"99 gainsco / bob stalling racing\" is listed under the \"Pole\" column.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the verification process:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Round**: The claim specifies \"round 10.\" Therefore, we focus on the entries where `Round` equals 10.\n\n2. **Check Pole Position**: Within round 10, examine the \"Pole\" column to see if \"99 gainsco / bob stalling racing\" is listed as the pole position for any race.\n\n3. **Count Occurrences**: The claim states there is \"1 race\" with this condition met. We need to count how many races in round 10 have \"99 gainsco / bob stalling racing\" as the pole position and ensure it matches the claim.\n\n4. **Determine Validity**:\n   - If exactly one race meets the criteria, the claim is true.\n   - Otherwise, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the data:\n\n- For `Round` 10:\n  - The first entry has \"99 gainsco / bob stallings racing\" in the \"Pole\" column.\n  - The second entry also lists \"99 gainsco / bob stallings racing\" as the pole position.\n\nSince there are two races with \"99 gainsco / bob stalling racing\" in the pole position for round 10, the claim is incorrect. The claim states there should be only one such race.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Pole\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Pole\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The relevant cells are from row indices 9 and 10 for the column \"Pole\" in round 10.\n- These rows confirm that \"99 gainsco / bob stalling racing\" is listed as pole position twice, contradicting the claim of only one race.",
