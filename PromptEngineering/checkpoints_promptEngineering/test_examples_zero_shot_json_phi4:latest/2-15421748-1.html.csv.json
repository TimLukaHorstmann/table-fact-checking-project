We are interested in the team at the fifth position.\n   \n2. **Locate the data for the fifth position**:\n   - Row index 4 (since indexing typically starts at 0) corresponds to the fifth position.\n\n3. **Find the relevant column**: The claim concerns the \"difference\" or goal difference, so we need to check this specific column in the identified row.\n\n4. **Verify the value**:\n   - In row 4, under the column \"difference\", the value is \"0\".\n\nSince the value for the fifth position's goal difference is indeed 0, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
