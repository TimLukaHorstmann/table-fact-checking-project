Thus:\n\n- **Row Index:** The index of the data row for game 4 is `3` (since the first element in the data list starts at index 0).\n- **Column Name:** The relevant column name is \"date.\"\n\nThe final JSON object indicating that the claim is true, along with the relevant cell information, is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The series score is 1 - 4 on April 25.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant data from the table for these conditions:\n\n- **Game Number**: We check the first column \"game\" for a value of 4.\n- **Date**: We verify if this game occurs on April 25 by checking the second column \"date\".\n- **Series Score**: We confirm that the series score is 1 - 4 by examining the last column \"series\".\n\nNow, let's look at the relevant row in the table:\n\n- Row index 3 (since rows are zero-indexed):\n  - Column \"game\" has the value 4.\n  - Column \"date\" has the value \"april 25\".\n  - Column \"series\" has the value \"1 - 3\".\n\nThe series score is \"1 - 3\", not \"1 - 4\".
