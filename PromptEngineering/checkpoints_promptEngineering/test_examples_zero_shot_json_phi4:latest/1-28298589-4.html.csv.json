    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to compare attendance for games played at different times of the day: \"middle of the day\" (12:00 pm) and \"late afternoon or evening\" (1:00 pm, 3:30 pm, and 7:00 pm). The relevant column here is \"attendance\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. **Identify Games at 12:00 pm (Middle of the Day):**\n   - South Florida vs. No. 8 Florida\n     - Attendance: 90,612\n   - Indiana State vs. Cincinnati\n     - Attendance: 30,807\n   - Texas Southern vs. Connecticut\n     - Attendance: 37,359\n\n2. **Identify Games at 1:00 pm (Late Afternoon):**\n   - New Hampshire vs. Pittsburgh\n     - Attendance: 50,120\n\n3. **Identify Games at 3:30 pm (Late Afternoon):**\n   - Eastern Kentucky vs. Louisville\n     - Attendance: 51,427\n\n4. **Identify Games at 7:00 pm (Evening):**\n   - No. 23 West Virginia vs. Marshall\n     - Attendance: 41,382\n   - Syracuse vs. Washington\n     - Attendance: 62,418\n\n### Compare Average Attendances:\n\n- **Average Attendance for 12:00 pm Games:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average} = \\frac{90612 + 30807 + 37359}{3} = \\frac{158778}{3} = 52,926\n  \\]\n\n- **Average Attendance for 1:00 pm, 3:30 pm, and 7:00 pm Games:**\n  - 1:00 pm Game: 50,120\n  - 3:30 pm Game: 51,427\n  - 7:00 pm Games:\n    - 41,382\n    - 62,418\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average} = \\frac{50120 + 51427 + 41382 + 62418}{4} = \\frac{205347}{4} = 51,336.75\n  \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe average attendance for games at 12:00 pm (52,926) is higher than the average attendance for games played later in the day (51,336.75).

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"Washington win against Syracuse in front of 62418 fans at home,\" we need to verify several conditions from the table:\n\n1. **Match between Washington and Syracuse**: We look for an entry where Washington is the home team and Syracuse is the visiting team.\n\n2. **Outcome of the match**: The result should indicate a win for Washington.\n\n3. **Attendance**: The number of fans present at the game should be 62418.\n\n4. **Location confirmation**: The game must be played at Washington's home venue.\n\nLet's verify these conditions using the table data:\n\n- **Condition 1 & 2**: Locate the entry where \"home team\" is \"Washington\" and \"visiting team\" is \"Syracuse\". This corresponds to the row with:\n  - Date: September 11\n  - Time: 7:00 pm\n  - Visiting Team: Syracuse\n  - Home Team: Washington\n\n- **Condition 3**: Check if the attendance in this entry is 62418. The \"attendance\" column value for this match is indeed 62418.\n\n- **Condition 4**: Confirm that the site of the game is a recognized home venue for Washington, which is \"Husky Stadium Seattle, WA\". This matches the location provided in the table.\n\n- **Result Verification**: Finally, check if the result shows a win for Washington. The entry states: \"l 20 - 41\", indicating a loss (L) for Washington, as they scored 20 points while Syracuse scored 41.\n\nSince the result indicates that Washington lost to Syracuse, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- Row index 6:\n  - Column \"visiting team\": Contains \"syracuse\"\n  - Column \"home team\": Contains \"washington\"\n  - Column \"result\": Contains \"l 20 - 41\"\n  - Column \"attendance\": Contains \"62418\"\n\nHere is the JSON object representing the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"visiting team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
