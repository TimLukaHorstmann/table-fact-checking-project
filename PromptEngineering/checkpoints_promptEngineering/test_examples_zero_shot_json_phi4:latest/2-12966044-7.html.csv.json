The group position at that time was 3rd.\n\nLet's examine each row in the data for these specific values:\n\n- **Row 0:** \n  - Attendance: 62,749 (not 22,506)\n  - Group Position: 1st (not 3rd)\n\n- **Row 1:** \n  - Attendance: 65,000 (not 22,506)\n  - Group Position: 1st (not 3rd)\n\n- **Row 2:** \n  - Attendance: 30,500 (not 22,506)\n  - Group Position: 2nd (not 3rd)\n\n- **Row 3:** \n  - Attendance: 66,313 (not 22,506)\n  - Group Position: 1st (not 3rd)\n\n- **Row 4:** \n  - Attendance: 22,506 (matches the claim)\n  - Group Position: 3rd (matches the claim)\n\n- **Row 5:** \n  - Attendance: 66,776 (not 22,506)\n  - Group Position: 2nd (not 3rd)\n\nThe only row that satisfies both conditions is Row 4.

If so, check if the score for that game was \"0 - 0\".\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Games Against Dynamo Kyiv\n\nWe need to look at the \"opponents\" column and find entries where the opponent is \"dynamo kyiv\". \n\n- **19 September 2000**: The opponent is \"dynamo kyiv\".\n- **8 November 2000**: The opponent is \"dynamo kyiv\".\n\n### Step 2: Check Group Position for Each Game\n\nFor each game identified in step 1, check the \"group position\" column:\n\n- **19 September 2000**:\n  - Group Position: \"1st\"\n\n- **8 November 2000**:\n  - Group Position: \"2nd\"\n\n### Step 3: Verify Result of Relevant Game\n\nSince we are interested in games with a group position of \"1st\", the relevant game is on **19 September 2000**. Now, check the result for this date:\n\n- **Result (F - A)**: \"0 - 0\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe conditions match the claim: The game against Dynamo Kyiv on 19 September 2000 had a group position of \"1st\" and a score of \"0 - 0\".
