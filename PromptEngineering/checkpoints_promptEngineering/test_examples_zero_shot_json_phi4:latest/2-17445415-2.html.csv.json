Identify if there are two fights where a \"technical knockout (strikes)\" was the method.\n2. Ensure these two fights occurred within the same event.\n\nLet's analyze each row in the data:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Method: \"ko (punch)\"\n  - Event: \"purecombat - bring the pain\"\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Method: \"submission (triangle choke)\"\n  - Event: \"ufc 36\"\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Method: \"decision\"\n  - Event: \"ifc wc 13 - warriors challenge 13\"\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Method: \"tko\"\n  - Event: \"ifc wc 13 - warriors challenge 13\"\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Method: \"decision\"\n  - Event: \"kotc 6 - road warriors\"\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Method: \"tko (strikes)\"\n  - Event: \"kotc 3 - knockout nightmare\"\n\nFrom this analysis, only Row 5 has a method of \"tko (strikes).\" There is no other row with the same method. Therefore, there are not two fights where \"technical knockout (strikes)\" was the deciding factor.\n\nSince the condition of having two such fights in the same event is not met, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to check for this analysis are from Row 5 and all rows for the \"method\" column:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding Kelly's third win against Rudy Vallederas by TKO outside of a typical round, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Kelly's Wins:**\n   - We look at each row in the \"data\" array and check for entries where the \"res\" (result) is \"win.\"\n\n2. **Track the Sequence of Wins:**\n   - We need to verify that Kelly's third win corresponds to a match against Rudy Vallederas.\n\n3. **Verify Conditions for the Third Win:**\n   - Confirm that this third win was achieved by \"tko.\"\n   - Ensure it was against \"rudy vallederas.\"\n   - Check if the \"round\" is marked as \"n / a,\" indicating an atypical round (not within a specific round number).\n\n### Analysis of Data:\n\n- **First Win:**\n  - Opponent: shad smith\n  - Method: tko (strikes)\n  - Event: kotc 3 - knockout nightmare\n  - Round: 1\n\n- **Second Win:**\n  - Opponent: duane ludwig\n  - Method: decision\n  - Event: kotc 6 - road warriors\n  - Round: 3\n\n- **Third Win:**\n  - Opponent: rudy vallederas\n  - Method: tko\n  - Event: ifc wc 13 - warriors challenge 13\n  - Round: n / a (atypical round)\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe third win was indeed against Rudy Vallederas, achieved by TKO, and occurred in an atypical round (\"n / a\").
