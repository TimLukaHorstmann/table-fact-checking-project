The table uses lowercase in JSON representation, so it's essential to match exactly.\n  \n- Once identified, check if the \"us viewers (million)\" for that row is 2.81.\n\n**Table Examination:**\n- From the provided data, observe each entry under the column \"directed by\" for a match with \"melanie mayron\".\n\n- In Row Index 10:\n  - **Row Data**: [11, 92, \"fallout\", \"brian mcnamara\", \"linda gase\", \"may 6 , 2012\", 3.07]\n  - The director is \"brian mcnamara\".
