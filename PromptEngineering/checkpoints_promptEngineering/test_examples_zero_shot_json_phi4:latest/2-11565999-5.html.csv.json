    "resp": "To verify the claim \"the song title for track 9 be just a little bit,\" we need to check the relevant information in the provided table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Track:**\n   - The claim specifies \"track 9.\" We need to locate this track number within the data array.\n   \n2. **Extract Song Title for Track 9:**\n   - Once the row corresponding to \"track 9\" is identified, we must extract the value in the \"song title\" column of that row.\n\n3. **Compare with Claimed Song Title:**\n   - The extracted song title should be compared against the claim's specified song title \"just a little bit.\"\n\nNow let's execute these steps:\n\n- From the data array:\n  - Track number 9 corresponds to the row with index 8 (since indexing is zero-based).\n  - In this row, the \"song title\" column contains \"just a little bit\".\n\nThus, for track 9, the song title is indeed \"just a little bit,\" which matches the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cell for verifying this information is at:\n- Row index: 8\n- Column name: \"song title\"\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"song title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
