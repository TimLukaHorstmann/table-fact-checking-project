    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the game on March 8 is true or false, we need to verify the details provided in the table against those mentioned in the claim.\n\nThe claim states: \"the game on march 8 be play by minnesota (home) and philadelphia (visitor)\".\n\nLet's break down what needs to be verified:\n1. **Date**: The date of the game should be March 8.\n2. **Visitor Team**: The visitor team should be Philadelphia.\n3. **Home Team**: The home team should be Minnesota.\n\nNow, let's check these conditions against the table:\n\n- **Finding the row for March 8**:\n  - We need to locate the entry where the \"date\" is \"march 8\". From the data provided in the JSON format, this corresponds to the fifth element (index 4) of the \"data\" list.\n\n- **Verifying the visitor team**:\n  - In row index 4, the \"visitor\" column shows \"philadelphia\", which matches the claim.\n\n- **Verifying the home team**:\n  - In the same row (index 4), the \"home\" column is \"minnesota\", which also matches the claim.\n\nSince all conditions are satisfied by the data in the table for March 8, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\nHere's the JSON output with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
