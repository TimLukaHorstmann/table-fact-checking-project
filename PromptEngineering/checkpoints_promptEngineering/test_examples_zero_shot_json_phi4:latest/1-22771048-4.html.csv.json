This occurs at index 18 (considering zero-based indexing).\n\n2. **Verify the Claim's Conditions**:\n   - The claim states there is one park and ride project proposed for Overlake Village.\n   - We need to check two columns for this row: \"park and ride\" and ensure that the station name aligns with \"Overlake Village\".\n\n3. **Check Relevant Data**:\n   - For row index 18, the relevant data is as follows:\n     - \"station\": \"overlake village\"\n     - \"park and ride\": \"yes\"\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The row for Overlake Village shows a park and ride project proposed (as indicated by \"yes\" in the \"park and ride\" column).\n   - Since there is only one entry related to Overlake Village, the claim that there is one park and ride project proposed is supported.\n\nBased on this analysis, we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"station\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"park and ride\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
