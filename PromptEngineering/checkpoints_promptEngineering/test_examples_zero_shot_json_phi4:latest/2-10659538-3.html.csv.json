    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to verify two aspects from the table: \n\n1. The attendance for the game against the Indianapolis Colts on December 30, 2001.\n2. The match result for that specific date.\n\nLet's break down these steps:\n\n- **Identify the relevant row:** We are looking for the row where both the \"date\" is \"December 30, 2001\", and the \"opponent\" is \"Indianapolis Colts\". Based on the provided data, this corresponds to row index 15 (considering 0-based indexing).\n\n- **Check the attendance:** In row 15, under the \"attendance\" column, we need to verify if the value matches \"66084\".\n\n- **Confirm the game details:**\n  - The \"date\" should be \"December 30, 2001\".\n  - The \"opponent\" should be \"Indianapolis Colts\".\n\nUpon examining row 15:\n\n- The \"date\" is indeed \"December 30, 2001\".\n- The \"opponent\" listed is \"Indianapolis Colts\".\n- The attendance value given is \"66084\", which matches the claim.\n\nSince both conditions in the claim are satisfied with the data from row 15, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are:\n- Row index 15, column \"date\"\n- Row index 15, column \"opponent\"\n- Row index 15, column \"attendance\"\n\nThus, the final JSON object reflecting this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
