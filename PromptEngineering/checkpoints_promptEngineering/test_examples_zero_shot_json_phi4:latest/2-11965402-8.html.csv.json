We need to find this date in the table.\n   - From the data, on row index 7, the date is \"april 16 , 2008\", matching the claim.\n\n2. **Teams Involved**: The claim mentions \"the Rocket and the Clipper\" playing against each other.\n   - In row index 7, the 'visitor' column shows \"clippers\" and the 'home' column shows \"rockets\". This confirms that Clippers were visitors and Rockets were home team in this game.\n\n3. **Location Verification**: The claim states both teams played at their own homes.\n   - For the Clippers to play at their own home, they should be listed in the 'home' column, but here they are listed as 'visitor'. Therefore, Clippers did not play at their own home.\n   - Rockets were indeed playing at their own home.\n\n4. **Game Result Verification**: The claim states \"the Rocket lose 75 to 93\".\n   - In row index 7, the score is \"75 - 93\" with Clippers as the visitor. Since visitors (Clippers) scored 93 and hosts (Rockets) scored 75, Rockets lost this game.\n\nFrom these checks, we see that while the date, teams involved, and game result are correct according to the claim, the condition that both teams played at their own home is false because only the Rockets did so. Therefore, the overall claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table for verifying the claim are:\n\n- Row index 7, column \"date\": matches the date in the claim.\n- Row index 7, column \"visitor\": verifies one of the teams involved.\n- Row index 7, column \"home\": verifies both teams involved and the home team status.\n- Row index 7, column \"score\": verifies the result of the game.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
