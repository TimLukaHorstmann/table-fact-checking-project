The claim specifies a context of the \"2008 Belarusian Premier League,\" but our dataset pertains only to European football competitions such as the UEFA InterToto Cup and UEFA Champions League. Therefore, any analysis will be restricted to the content present in this table.\n\nHere's how we'll proceed:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: Look through each row of data for the \"agg\" column where the value is \"4 - 1\".\n2. **Check Context**: Verify if these instances belong to the context of the \"2008 Belarusian Premier League\". Since our dataset does not include any matches labeled as part of the \"2008 Belarusian Premier League,\" we need to check only for the existence and count of matches with this aggregate score.\n3. **Count Instances**: Count how many times \"4 - 1\" appears in the \"agg\" column.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- First, locate the rows where \"agg\" is \"4 - 1\":\n  - In row 5: `legia warszawa` vs `gomel`, with an aggregate score of \"4 - 1\".\n  \nNo other rows have an aggregate score of \"4 - 1\". Thus, there is only one match in the dataset with this aggregate result.\n\n- **Check for Context**: Since the claim specifies the \"2008 Belarusian Premier League,\" and our table does not contain any matches from this league, we cannot confirm the context. However, strictly by the data available, there's only one occurrence of \"4 - 1\" in the entire dataset.\n\nThus, considering the claim strictly within the scope of what is present in the dataset:\n\n- There is indeed only one match with an aggregate score of \"4 - 1\".\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim based on the table data (ignoring the context of the Belarusian Premier League as it's not represented) is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cell for this decision:\n- Row index 5 in the \"agg\" column where the value is \"4 - 1\".\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Row Index 7, Column \"team 2\" (for identifying Valur's participation and result).\n2.
