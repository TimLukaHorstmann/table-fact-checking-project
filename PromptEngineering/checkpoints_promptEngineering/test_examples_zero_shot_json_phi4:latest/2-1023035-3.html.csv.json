    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Vaughan Coveny is true or false, we need to verify each part of the claim against the table data:\n\n1. **Verification of Caps in Second and Third Year:**\n   - First, extract the relevant data for Vaughan Coveny from the table:\n     - Career span: 1992 - 2006\n     - Total caps: 64\n     - First cap date: 7 June 1992\n     - Most recent cap date: 4 June 2006\n\n   - **Second Year Verification:**\n     - Vaughan Coveny's first year starts in 1992.\n     - The second year would be 1993.\n     - We need to check if he had any caps during the year 1993.\n\n   - **Third Year Verification:**\n     - The third year of his career is 1994.\n     - We need to check if he had any caps during the year 1994.\n\n2. **Verification of Total Caps by End of Third Year:**\n   - The claim states that he had a total of 19 caps throughout his first three years (1992, 1993, and 1994).\n   - We need to find out how many caps he accumulated by the end of 1994.\n\n### Relevant Data Extraction:\n- **Row Index for Vaughan Coveny:** Row index is 0.\n- **Relevant Columns:**\n  - \"first cap\" (to determine when his first cap was)\n  - \"most recent cap\" (to confirm overall career span)\n  - \"caps\" (total caps during his career)\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Checking Caps in 1993 and 1994:**\n  - The table does not provide a breakdown of caps per year, so we cannot directly verify the number of caps in 1993 or 1994 from the table alone.\n  \n- **Total Caps by End of Third Year:**\n  - Without additional data on yearly caps, we cannot confirm if he had exactly 19 caps by the end of 1994.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven that the table does not provide detailed yearly cap information, we cannot conclusively verify the claim about having caps in the second and third years or reaching 19 caps by the end of the third year. Therefore, based on the available data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"first cap\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"most recent cap\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"caps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
