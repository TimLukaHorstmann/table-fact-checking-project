    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"nick lucas only appear in the first season\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table regarding Nick Lucas's character.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Row for Nick Lucas:**\n   - The table shows that Nick Lucas is portrayed by Nick Jonas.\n   - We locate this information in the first row of the \"data\" array:\n     ```json\n     [\n       \"nick lucas\",\n       \"nick jonas\",\n       \"seasons 1 - 2\",\n       \"appears in all seasons\",\n       34\n     ]\n     ```\n\n2. **Evaluate Main Cast Seasons:**\n   - The column labeled \"main cast seasons\" for Nick Lucas states \"seasons 1 - 2\". This indicates that Nick Lucas is part of the main cast from season 1 to season 2.\n\n3. **Check Recurring Cast Seasons:**\n   - The column labeled \"recurring cast seasons\" mentions \"appears in all seasons.\" This implies that Nick Lucas appears in every season, not just season 1.\n\n4. **Conclusion Based on Data:**\n   - Since Nick Lucas is listed as part of the main cast for both seasons 1 and 2, and he also appears in all seasons, it contradicts the claim that he \"only appear[s] in the first season.\"\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n- The claim is FALSE because the data shows Nick Lucas appears in both seasons 1 and 2.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- We need to consider the cells from row 0 (Nick Lucas) that are relevant to verify this claim:\n  - \"main cast seasons\" confirms his presence in seasons 1 and 2.\n  - \"recurring cast seasons\" further supports his appearance in all seasons.\n\nHere is the JSON response with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"main cast seasons\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"recurring cast seasons\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
