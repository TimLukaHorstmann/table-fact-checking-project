Bobby Wilson's pick details.\n2. Jimmy Spencer's pick details.\n3. The order in which these picks occurred.\n\nLet's break down the necessary steps:\n\n1. **Identify the row for Bobby Wilson:**\n   - Look for \"Bobby Wilson\" in the \"name\" column of the table to find his draft information.\n   - Bobby Wilson is listed with `round = 1`, `pick = 17`, and `overall = 17`.\n\n2. **Identify the row for Jimmy Spencer:**\n   - Look for \"Jimmy Spencer\" in the \"name\" column of the table to find his draft information.\n   - Jimmy Spencer is listed with `round = 8`, `pick = 20`, and `overall = 215`.\n\n3. **Determine the draft order:**\n   - Bobby Wilson's overall pick number is 17, which occurs in Round 1, Pick 17.\n   - Jimmy Spencer's overall pick number is 215, which occurs in Round 8, Pick 20.\n\n4. **Compare the draft positions:**\n   - Since 17 comes before 215 in the sequence of picks, Bobby Wilson was indeed selected before Jimmy Spencer.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table for this evaluation are:\n- For Bobby Wilson: `row_index = 0` with columns \"round,\" \"pick,\" and \"overall.\"\n- For Jimmy Spencer: `row_index = 4` with columns \"round,\" \"pick,\" and \"overall.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
