    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the number of tournament play in 2000 be 2\" is true or false, we need to examine the data provided in the table.\n\nThe relevant column for this claim is \"tournaments played\", as it directly relates to the number of tournaments played in a given year. We will also check the row corresponding to the year 2000.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Identify the row index where the year is 2000.\n2. Check the value under the \"tournaments played\" column for this specific year.\n\nLet's go through these steps with the provided table data:\n\n- The \"columns\" list confirms that the relevant column is at index 1, which corresponds to \"tournaments played\".\n- The \"data\" array provides information for each year. We need to find the row where the first element (year) is 2000.\n\nExamining the data:\n- Row 0: Year 1998\n- **Row 1**: Year 2000 (relevant row)\n- Row 2: Year 2001\n- Row 3: Year 2002\n- Row 4: Year 2003\n- Row 5: Year 2004\n- Row 6: Year 2005\n\nIn Row 1, the value under \"tournaments played\" is 29.\n\nThe claim states that the number of tournaments played in 2000 should be 2. However, according to the table data, it is actually 29.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow we construct the JSON response with the relevant cell:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tournaments played\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
