    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"joe germanese be the 27th pick\" is true or false, we need to verify two pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. Check if Joe Germanese is indeed the player associated with the 27th pick.\n2. Confirm that his position is listed as \"m\".\n\nLet's examine the relevant row in the provided JSON data.\n\n- We are looking for a row where the \"pick\" column value is 27.\n- In this table, rows start from an index of 0. Therefore, the 27th pick corresponds to the 13th row (since indexing starts at 0).\n\nFrom the JSON data:\n```json\n[\n  26,\n  \"chicago fire\",\n  \"peter lowry\",\n  \"m / f\",\n  \"santa clara san jose frogs\"\n],\n[\n  27,\n  \"new england revolution\",\n  \"joe germanese\",\n  \"m\",\n  \"duke cary railhawks u23 's\"\n]\n```\n\nIn the row with index 13:\n- The \"pick\" column is indeed 27.\n- The \"player\" column lists \"Joe Germanese.\"\n- The \"position\" column lists \"m.\"\n\nThis confirms that Joe Germanese is the 27th pick.\n\nThus, the claim is true. Here are the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"Jonathan Leather be pick 25th,\" we need to examine specific cells in the table corresponding to the conditions outlined by the claim. Let's break down the verification process:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Details in the Claim:**\n   - Name of the player: Jonathan Leather\n   - Pick number: 25th\n\n2. **Locate the Player Name and Pick Number:**\n   - We need to find a row where the \"player\" column contains \"jonathan leathers.\"\n   - We also need to ensure that this corresponds with pick number 25.\n\n3. **Search for Relevant Rows in the Data:**\n\n   - Scan through each row under the \"data\" key:\n     - Row at index 10 (11th entry, as indexing starts from 0) has:\n       - \"player\": \"jonathan leathers\"\n       - \"pick\": 25\n     - This matches both conditions of the claim.\n\n4. **Verify Correspondence:**\n   - The player name and pick number in row index 10 correspond exactly with the claim's details.\n  \n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is a match for both the player name and pick number, the claim \"jonathan leather be pick 25th\" is TRUE.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells to Verify Claim:**\n   - Row index 10 in column \"player\" has the value \"jonathan leathers.\"\n   - Row index 10 in column \"pick\" has the value 25.\n\nBased on this examination, we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
