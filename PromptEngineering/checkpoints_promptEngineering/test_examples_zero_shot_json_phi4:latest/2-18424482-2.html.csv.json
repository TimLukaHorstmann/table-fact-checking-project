    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"sleepless night (featuring vince gill ) be the song with the longest length\" is true or false, we need to check two main aspects:\n\n1. Verify if there's a song titled \"sleepless night (featuring vince gill)\" and confirm its details.\n2. Compare the length of this song against all other songs listed in the table to see if it indeed has the longest duration.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification\n\n#### 1. Check for Song Title\n- Look through the data to find a row with the song title \"sleepless night (featuring vince gill)\".\n- From the table, we identify the entry: \n\n  - Track 4: \n    - Song Title: \"sleepless nights (featuring vince gill )\"\n    - Length: \"4:21\"\n\n#### 2. Compare Lengths\n- Extract the length of each song from the table and compare it with \"4:21\" to see if any other song is longer.\n\nHere are the relevant lengths for comparison:\n\n1. Track 1: \"2:18\"\n2. Track 2: \"2:46\"\n3. Track 3: \"2:59\"\n4. **Track 4: \"4:21\"** (Sleepless Nights)\n5. Track 5: \"4:00\"\n6. Track 6: \"2:35\"\n7. Track 7: \"2:35\"\n8. Track 8: \"3:06\"\n9.

Determine the Longest Length\n- Convert all time durations into seconds for easier comparison:\n  - \"4:21\" = 261 seconds\n  - Other times converted similarly show that no other song exceeds 261 seconds.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states \"sleepless night (featuring vince gill ) be the song with the longest length\". The entry \"sleepless nights (featuring vince gill )\" is indeed the longest at 4:21. Thus, the claim is TRUE based on the data provided.\n\nNow, we identify the relevant cells:\n\n- Row for \"sleepless night (featuring vince gill )\", which corresponds to Track 4:\n  - Song Title: Row index 3\n  - Length: Row index 3\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"song title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"length\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Therefore, there is only one song that meets the criteria specified in the claim.\n\nThus, the claim \"Cold, cold heart be 1 of 2 song from Hank Williams\" is FALSE because there is only one such song, not two.\n\nRelevant cells for verification are in row 14:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"writer (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"original artist\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The `row_index` is zero-based, so the 14th row in a typical one-indexed table corresponds to index 13.",
