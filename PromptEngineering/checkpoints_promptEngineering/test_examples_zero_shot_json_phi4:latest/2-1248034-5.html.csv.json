The record label for this album is RCA.\n\nLet's analyze these step-by-step using the data from the table:\n\n### Step 1: Verify Album and Artist\n\nThe claim states that the album \"Spice\" should be associated with the artist \"Cher.\" We will check each row in the `data` section of the JSON to find any entry where:\n- The column for \"album\" contains \"spice.\"\n\nUpon checking, we find:\n\n- In row 6 (indexing from zero):\n  - \"year\": 1996\n  - \"artist\": \"spice girls\"\n  - \"album\": \"spice\"\n  - \"record label\": \"virgin\"\n  - \"weeks at number one\": 15\n\nThis entry shows that the album \"Spice\" is by \"Spice Girls,\" not Cher. Therefore, this part of the claim is false.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Record Label\n\nThe claim also asserts that the record label for the album \"Spice\" should be RCA. From the same row found above (row 6), we see:\n\n- The \"record label\" column lists \"virgin.\"\n\nThus, the record label is not RCA; it is Virgin.
