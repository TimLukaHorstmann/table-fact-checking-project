Thus, we verify if there are exactly two or fewer songs sung in English.\n\n**Relevant Data Analysis:**\n1. **Column Identification**: \n   - We focus on the column labeled \"language\" because it specifies the language each song is sung in.\n   \n2. **Row Examination**:\n   - Iterate through each row to check the value in the \"language\" column for occurrences of English.\n\n3. **Counting Occurrences**:\n   - Count how many times \"english\" appears as the language.\n\n**Data Analysis from Table:**\n- Row 15: The song by \"the allisons\" is labeled with \"english\".\n\nFrom this analysis, we observe that only one song was sung in English.\n\n**Conclusion on Claim Verification:**\n- The claim states English was one of the least sung languages and mentions \"only have a couple of songs sing in it\". Given our finding of just one song being sung in English, it supports the statement of having \"a couple\" (interpreted as two or fewer), but we cannot definitively conclude it is one of the least without data on other languages.\n- However, since only one occurrence is consistent with having a small number, the part about \"a couple of songs\" holds true.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nThe claim is supported by the data in terms of English being sung in a limited number of entries.
