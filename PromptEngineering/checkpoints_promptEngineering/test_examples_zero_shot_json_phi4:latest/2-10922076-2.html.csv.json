The power plant is located at \"Ramakkalmedu\".\n2. Its total capacity is indeed 25 MWE.\n\nHence, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\nThe relevant cells from this examination are:\n- Row index 3 for the column `location`.\n- Row index 3 for the column `total capacity (mwe)`.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to the claim is \"TRUE\".\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total capacity (mwe)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
