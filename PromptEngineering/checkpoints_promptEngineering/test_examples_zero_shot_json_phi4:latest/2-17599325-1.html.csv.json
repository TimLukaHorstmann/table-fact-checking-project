    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the only driver to win both races on the same circuit be Lex Davison\" is true or false, we need to examine the table and check for instances where a driver won more than one race at the same circuit.\n\nHere's how we can verify this:\n\n1. **Identify Circuits with Multiple Races:**\n   - We need to find if there are any circuits that hosted more than one race in the table.\n   \n2. **Check Winners for Each Circuit:**\n   - For each circuit with multiple races, check if the same driver won both races.\n\n3. **Evaluate Lex Davison's Wins:**\n   - Check if Lex Davison is the only driver who won two races at the same circuit.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- **Circuit: Lowood Circuit**\n  - Rows:\n    - Row 5: \"Queensland road racing championship\" on 15 June, winner Alec Mildren.\n    - Row 6: \"Lowood trophy\" on 31 August, winner Alec Mildren.\n  - Observation: Alec Mildren won both races at the Lowood circuit.\n\n- **Other Circuits:**\n  - Check other circuits for multiple races:\n    - Gnoo Blas Circuit, Fisherman's Bend, Longford Circuit, Port Wakefield Circuit, Mount Panorama Circuit, Albert Park, Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit each have only one race listed.\n  \n- **Lex Davison's Wins:**\n  - Row 7: \"Australian grand prix\" on 23 October at Mount Panorama Circuit, winner Lex Davison.\n  - Observation: Lex Davison won only this single race at the Mount Panorama circuit.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Alec Mildren is the driver who won two races at the same circuit (Lowood Circuit).\n- Lex Davison did not win multiple races at any circuit.\n- Therefore, the claim that \"the only driver to win both races on the same circuit be Lex Davison\" is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- For Alec Mildren's wins at Lowood Circuit:\n  - Row 5, Column \"winner\"\n  - Row 6, Column \"winner\"\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"winner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
