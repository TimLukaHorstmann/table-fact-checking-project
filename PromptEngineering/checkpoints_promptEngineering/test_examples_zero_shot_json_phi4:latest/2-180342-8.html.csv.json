    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify each condition specified in the claim against the data provided in the table.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"All 3 of the most recent tallest structures be at least 200 foot taller than everything that came after 1950.\"\n\n#### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Most Recent Tallest Structures:**\n   - The three most recent entries in terms of when they were the tallest are:\n     - Shard London Bridge (2010-), height: 1004 ft\n     - One Canada Square (1991-2010), height: 771 ft\n     - Crystal Palace Transmitting Station (1950-1991), height: 720 ft\n\n2. **Compare Heights of Structures After 1950:**\n   - We need to compare the heights of these three structures with any structure that became the tallest after 1950.\n   - From the data, the only structure that became the tallest after 1950 is Shard London Bridge (2010-).\n\n3. **Height Comparison:**\n   - **Shard London Bridge:** 1004 ft\n     - Compare with all other structures:\n       - White Tower: 90 ft\n       - Old St Paul's Cathedral: 493 ft\n       - Southwark Cathedral: 163 ft\n       - Monument to the Great Fire of London: 202 ft\n       - St Mary-le-Bow: 236 ft\n       - St Paul's Cathedral: 365 ft\n       - Battersea Power Station: 370 ft\n       - Crystal Palace Transmitting Station: 720 ft\n       - One Canada Square: 771 ft\n\n   - **One Canada Square:** 771 ft\n     - Compare with structures after it:\n       - Shard London Bridge: 1004 ft (not applicable as it comes after)\n\n   - **Crystal Palace Transmitting Station:** 720 ft\n     - Compare with structures after it:\n       - One Canada Square: 771 ft\n       - Shard London Bridge: 1004 ft\n\n#### Verification:\n- **Shard London Bridge** is taller than all previous structures by more than 200 feet.\n- **One Canada Square** does not need to be compared as there are no structures that became tallest after it and before Shard London Bridge.\n- **Crystal Palace Transmitting Station** is shorter than One Canada Square (771 ft) and Shard London Bridge (1004 ft), failing the condition of being at least 200 feet taller.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is false because Crystal Palace Transmitting Station is not at least 200 feet taller than structures that became tallest after it.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
