The team \"olimpia\" has recorded 2 wins.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions using the data provided in the JSON format:\n\n### Step 1: Verify Position\n- We need to check which row corresponds to the team \"olimpia\".\n- According to the table, each entry in the `data` array represents a row with the following structure:\n  - Index 0: position\n  - Index 1: team name\n\nFrom the data:\n- The row at index 9 (since JSON arrays are zero-indexed) has \"olimpia\" as the team name. It also shows that its position is 10.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Wins\n- For the same row where \"olimpia\" appears, we need to check the number of wins.\n- In each data entry:\n  - Index 3 corresponds to the \"wins\" column.\n\nFrom the data at index 9:\n- The value in the \"wins\" column is 2.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth conditions required by the claim are satisfied:\n1. \"olimpia\" is indeed in position 10.\n2. \"olimpia\" has recorded 2 wins.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n- The cell at row index 9 (team name column) to verify that it's \"olimpia\".\n- The cell at row index 9 (position column) to confirm position 10.\n- The cell at row index 9 (wins column) to check the number of wins.\n\nHere is the JSON response with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to interpret and evaluate it against the provided table data.\n\n### Claim Analysis\n\nThe claim states: \"the total number score of the team position higher than 10 be zero.\"\n\n- **Positions Higher Than 10**: In this context, positions higher than 10 would mean teams that are ranked in positions 11 or lower. However, since there are only 10 teams listed in the table (positions 1 to 10), no teams have a rank higher than 10.\n\n- **\"Total Number Score\"**: This phrase is somewhat ambiguous, but it likely refers to the \"scored\" column, which records the number of goals each team has scored.\n\n### Evaluating the Claim\n\nSince there are no teams with positions higher than 10 in this table:\n\n1. There are no relevant rows (or cells) to check for scores.\n2. Therefore, the condition is trivially satisfied because there are no scores to sum up or evaluate.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven that there are no teams ranked above position 10, the total number of scored goals by such non-existent teams is indeed zero.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nSince the claim pertains to positions higher than 10 and no such positions exist in the table, there are no relevant cells to consider.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
