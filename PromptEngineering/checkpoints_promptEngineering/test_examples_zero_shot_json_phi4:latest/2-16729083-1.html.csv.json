    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify each part of it against the given table:\n\n1. **Week Number Check**:\n   - The claim states \"in week 14\". We will look for the entry in the data where the \"week\" column value is 14.\n\n2. **Opponent Check**:\n   - According to the claim, the opponent should be \"kansas city chiefs\". We need to confirm that this matches the \"opponent\" column value for week 14.\n\n3. **Attendance Check**:\n   - The claim specifies an attendance of \"74524\". We must verify if the \"attendance\" column value for week 14 is indeed 74524.\n\nNow, let's check these conditions against the provided data:\n\n- Locate the row where `week` is 14:\n  - In the table, we find that in row with index 13 (0-based index), the \"week\" column has a value of 14.\n  \n- Verify opponent for this week:\n  - The \"opponent\" column value at row index 13 is \"kansas city chiefs\", which matches the claim.\n\n- Confirm attendance for this week:\n  - The \"attendance\" column value at row index 13 is 77778, not 74524 as claimed.\n\nBased on these checks:\n- The opponent and week number match the claim.\n- However, the attendance does not match (it's 77778 instead of 74524).\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE. We need to include relevant cells that were checked:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
