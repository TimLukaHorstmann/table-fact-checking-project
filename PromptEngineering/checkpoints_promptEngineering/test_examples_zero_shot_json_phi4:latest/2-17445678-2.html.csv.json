    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Brian Dunn be the opponent of the match in South Dakota, United States, which have 3 round,\" we need to verify two specific conditions from the table:\n\n1. **Opponent is Brian Dunn:** We will look for a row where the \"opponent\" column has the value \"brian dunn.\"\n2. **Location is South Dakota, United States:** From that same row or others with the above condition, check if the \"location\" column contains \"south dakota , united states.\"\n3. **Number of Rounds is 3:** Finally, ensure that the \"round\" column equals 3 for the same match.\n\nLet's analyze each relevant entry from the table data:\n\n- The record where the opponent is \"brian dunn\":\n  - Row index: 12\n  - Columns:\n    - Opponent: \"brian dunn\"\n    - Location: \"south dakota , united states\"\n    - Round: 2\n\nThe claim specifies that there should be a match in South Dakota with Brian Dunn as the opponent and lasting 3 rounds. However, upon checking row index 12:\n\n- The location is indeed \"south dakota , united states.\"\n- The opponent is correctly identified as \"brian dunn.\"\n- However, the number of rounds for this match is 2, not 3.\n\nSince all conditions of the claim must be satisfied and the round condition fails (it should be 3 but it's 2), we conclude that the claim is false. Therefore:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
