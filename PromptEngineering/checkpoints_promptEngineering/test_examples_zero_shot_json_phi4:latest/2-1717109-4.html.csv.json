We need to find this row within the data.\n\n2. **Verify Opponent Information**:\n   - Within the identified row, check the value in the column labeled \"opponent in final\" to see if it matches \"John McEnroe\".\n\nLet's go through these steps using the table:\n\n- The data for each tournament is organized by rows. We need to find the entry where the date is \"7 April 1987\".\n  \n  Upon examining the dates, we locate:\n  ```json\n  [\n    [\"7 april 1987\", \"dallas , - wct finals\", \"carpet\", \"john mcenroe\", \"6 - 0 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 2\"]\n  ]\n  ```\n  This row corresponds to the index `row_index: 6`.\n\n- The column \"opponent in final\" for this row contains \"john mcenroe\". \n\nSince both conditions of the claim are met \u2014 the date is correct, and the opponent is indeed John McEnroe \u2014 we conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this information include:\n- Row index 6 for the column \"date\".\n- Row index 6 for the column \"opponent in final\".\n\nBased on this analysis, here's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent in final\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
