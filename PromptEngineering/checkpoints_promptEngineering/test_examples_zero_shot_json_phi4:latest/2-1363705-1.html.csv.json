Determine the average per capita income for the United States.\n3. Verify if these two counties are indeed the only ones in New Mexico with a higher per capita income than this national average.\n\nFirst, let's extract the relevant data from the table:\n\n- **Los Alamos County:**\n  - Per Capita Income: 49,474\n  - Row Index: 0\n\n- **Santa Fe County:**\n  - Per Capita Income: 32,188\n  - Row Index: 1\n\n- **United States (National Average):**\n  - Per Capita Income: 27,334\n  - Row Index: 2\n\nNext, we need to check all counties in New Mexico to see which have a per capita income greater than the national average of $27,334.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if both De Baca and Harding counties have exactly 1000 households according to the data provided in the table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We must focus on the \"number of households\" column for both De Baca and Harding counties.\n   \n2. **Locate De Baca County Data:**\n   - According to the table, De Baca county is listed with:\n     - Row index: 14\n     - Number of households: 912\n\n3. **Locate Harding County Data:**\n   - Harding county is listed with:\n     - Row index: 22\n     - Number of households: 349\n   \n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that both counties have exactly 1000 households.\n   - Based on the data, De Baca has 912 households and Harding has 349 households.\n   - Neither county has 1000 households.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since neither De Baca nor Harding county matches the condition of having exactly 1000 households, the claim is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - The relevant cells that need to be checked are:\n     - De Baca (row index 14) in \"number of households\"\n     - Harding (row index 22) in \"number of households\"\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"number of households\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"number of households\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
