Hani Said scored a total of 3 goals.\n2. Sabry Raheel scored a total of 1 goal.\n\nNext, identify the relevant cells in the table for each part of the claim:\n\n### Part 1: Verification for Hani Said\n- We look at the row corresponding to \"Hani Said\".\n- The \"total\" column should contain the number `3` since it indicates his total goals.\n  \nIn the table:\n- Hani Said's data is found in the 5th row (index 4, considering zero-based indexing).\n- In that row, the \"total\" column indeed shows `3`.\n\n### Part 2: Verification for Sabry Raheel\n- We look at the row corresponding to \"Sabry Raheel\".\n- The \"total\" column should contain the number `1` as it represents his total goals.\n  \nIn the table:\n- Sabry Raheel's data is found in the 14th row (index 13).\n- In that row, the \"total\" column shows `1`.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are verified with the data provided in the relevant cells, the entire claim can be considered true.\n\nFinally, we compile this into a JSON format as per instructions:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON response indicates that the claim is supported by the data in the specified cells.",

Only scores in one event (Egyptian Premier League).\n  \n- **Mahmoud Fathallah**: Scores are [5, 0, 0]. Only scores in one event.\n\n- **Junior Agogo**: Scores are [3, 0, 1]. Scores in two events (Egyptian Premier League and CAF Champions League).\n\n- **Abdel Halim Ali**: Scores are [3, 0, 0]. Only scores in one event.\n\n- **Hani Said**: Scores are [3, 0, 0]. Only scores in one event.\n\n- **Shikabala**: Scores are [3, 0, 0]. Only scores in one event.\n\n- **Gamal Hamza**: Scores are [1, 0, 2]. Scores in two events (Egyptian Premier League and CAF Champions League).\n\n- **Ahmed Magdy**: Scores are [2, 0, 0]. Only scores in one event.\n\n- **Mostafa Gaafar**: Scores are [2, 0, 0]. Only scores in one event.\n\n- **Alaa Kamal**: Scores are [1, 0, 0]. Only scores in one event.\n\n- **Mahmoud Samir**: Scores are [1, 0, 0]. Only scores in one event.\n\n- **Ricardo Alves Fernandes**: Scores are [1, 0, 0]. Only scores in one event.\n\n- **Sabry Raheel**: Scores are [1, 0, 0]. Only scores in one event.\n\n- **Wisam El Abdy**: Scores are [1, 0, 0]. Only scores in one event.\n\n- **Amr El-Safty**: Scores are [0, 0, 1]. Only scores in one event.\n\n- **Own Goals**: Scores are [1, 0, 0]. Only scores in one event.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Gamal Hamza and Junior Agogo as the Only Players\n\nFrom our evaluation above, we found that only two players, Gamal Hamza and Junior Agogo, have scored in more than one event.
