    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"2012 have a nominated result\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify whether there's at least one entry in the table for the year 2012 with a \"nominated\" result.\n\n1. **Identify relevant rows**: We look through each row to check if the year matches 2012.\n   - The JSON data structure contains an array called `data`, where each sub-array represents a row of information about awards, including the year in the first position (index 0).\n\n2. **Check for \"nominated\" result**:\n   - For any rows with the year 2012, we need to check the value in the \"result\" column (which is at index 4) to see if it contains \"nominated\".\n\n3. **Review of data**:\n   - The table includes two entries where the year is 2012:\n\n     a. Row 18: \n        - Year = 2012\n        - Award = \"teen choice award\"\n        - Category = \"breakout star female\"\n        - Nominated work = \"bunheads\"\n        - Result = \"nominated\"\n\n     b.
