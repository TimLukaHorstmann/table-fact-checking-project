Identify the relevant rows for each film mentioned in the claim:\n   - \"Born to Kill\" is listed at row index 1.\n   - \"Christmas in August\" is listed at row index 2 and also appears again at row index 3 (since it's repeated with different titles).\n\n2. Check the 'year' column for both movies:\n   - For \"Born to Kill\" (row index 1), the year is 1996.\n   - For \"Christmas in August\" (row index 2 or 3, since they are duplicates), the year is 1998.\n\n3.
