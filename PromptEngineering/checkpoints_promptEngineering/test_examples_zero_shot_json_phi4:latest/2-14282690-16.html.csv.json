That game is against Bulgaria.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Date Range**: The date range \"between June and August\" includes games from any day in June, July, and August.\n\n2. **Filter Games for Croatia**:\n   - We need to look at the rows where Croatia is either listed as the home or away team.\n   \n3. **Check Dates and Opponents**:\n   - For each game involving Croatia within the specified date range, check if there's only one such game.\n   - Verify that this single game is against Bulgaria.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Row 3**: \n  - Date: \"4 June\"\n  - Match Type: \"world cup 2006 qualifier\"\n  - Opponent: \"bulgaria\" (Croatia is the away team)\n  - This game is within the date range and involves Croatia playing against Bulgaria.\n\n- **Rows Involving Dates in July and August**:\n  - **Row 4**: \n    - Date: \"17 August\"\n    - Match Type: \"friendly\"\n    - Opponent: \"brazil\" (Croatia is the home team)\n    - This game involves Croatia but not against Bulgaria.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- There are two games involving Croatia between June and August:\n  1. Against Bulgaria on 4 June.\n  2. Against Brazil on 17 August.\n\nSince there are two games, not just one, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 3: Date \"4 june\", Opponent \"bulgaria\"\n- Row 4: Date \"17 august\", Opponent \"brazil\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"9 february\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"israel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"4 june\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"bulgaria\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"17 august\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"brazil\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
