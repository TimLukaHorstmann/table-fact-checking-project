    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify two conditions based on the provided data:\n\n1. **Outcome of the game against Montreal**: The claim states \"after defeat montreal,\" which implies Pittsburgh lost their game against Montreal.\n2. **Pittsburgh's record after this game**: According to the claim, Pittsburgh's record should be 3-0-2 immediately following the game against Montreal.\n\nLet's analyze the data step by step:\n\n1. **Find the row where Pittsburgh played Montreal**:\n   - The relevant row is: `[\"october 15\", \"montreal\", \"2 - 5\", \"pittsburgh\", \"3 - 0 - 2\"]`.\n   - In this game, Montreal scored 2 and Pittsburgh scored 5. Thus, Pittsburgh won the game.\n\n2. **Verify Pittsburgh's record after playing Montreal**:\n   - According to the data, after defeating Montreal on October 15, Pittsburgh's record is listed as \"3 - 0 - 2\".\n\nThe claim states that Pittsburgh was defeated by Montreal, but from the data, we see that Pittsburgh won against Montreal. Therefore, the first condition of the claim is false.\n\nGiven this analysis, the claim \"after defeat montreal , pittsburgh 's record be 3 - 0 - 2\" is FALSE because Pittsburgh did not lose to Montreal; they won.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are:\n- The row where Montreal played against Pittsburgh: `[\"october 15\", \"montreal\", \"2 - 5\", \"pittsburgh\", \"3 - 0 - 2\"]`.\n  - Relevant columns: \"score\" and \"record\".\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table and focus on specific conditions mentioned in the claim:\n\n1. **Date Condition**: The claim specifies \"before October 15\". We need to look at games that occurred before this date.\n\n2. **Visitor Condition**: The claim mentions \"Montreal be the visitor.\" We must identify which team was the visitor in each game before October 15.\n\n3. **Record Change Condition**: The claim states that a particular game led to a record of \"3 - 0 - 2\". We need to check when this record appeared and whether it followed a game involving Montreal as the visitor.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant data:\n\n- **October 6**: Visitor: Philadelphia, Record: 0 - 0 - 1\n- **October 8**: Visitor: NY Islanders, Record: 1 - 0 - 1\n- **October 10**: Visitor: Pittsburgh (against Montreal), Record: 1 - 0 - 2\n\nOn October 13:\n- **Visitor**: Buffalo, Resulting Record: 2 - 0 - 2\n\nOn October 15:\n- **Visitor**: Montreal, Resulting Record: 3 - 0 - 2\n\nNow, let's verify the claim:\n\n- Before October 15, the games involving Montreal as a visitor were on October 10 (Pittsburgh was the home team) and October 15.\n- The record changed to \"3 - 0 - 2\" after the game on October 15 when Montreal visited Pittsburgh.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because the game on October 15 with Montreal as the visitor led to a record of \"3 - 0 - 2\".\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Row index 4 (October 15): Visitor column (\"Montreal\") and Record column (\"3 - 0 - 2\")\n- Row index 3 (October 13): Record column (\"2 - 0 - 2\") to show the record before October 15\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
