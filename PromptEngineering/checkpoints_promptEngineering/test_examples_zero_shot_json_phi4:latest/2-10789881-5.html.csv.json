The venue should be \"mcg\".\n2. The away team should be \"footscray\".\n3. The away team's score should be \"10.11 (71)\".\n\nLet's examine these conditions one by one using the data from the relevant row in the JSON table:\n\n- **Venue Check**: According to the table, for the match involving Melbourne and Footscray:\n  - The venue is listed as \"mcg\". This condition matches the claim.\n\n- **Away Team Check**: In the same match entry:\n  - The away team is listed as \"footscray\". This condition also matches the claim.\n\n- **Score Check**: For this match:\n  - The score for the away team (Footscray) is given as \"10.11 (71)\". This condition perfectly matches the claim.\n\nSince all three conditions in the claim are verified to be true against the data from row index 4, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
