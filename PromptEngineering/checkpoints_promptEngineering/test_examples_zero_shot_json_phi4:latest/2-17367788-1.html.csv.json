Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to verify this:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that every number in the \"points 1\" column must be between 25 and 71, inclusive.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Data**: The relevant data for checking this claim are the values in the \"points 1\" column from each row of the table.\n\n3. **Check Each Value**:\n   - For each team (row), check if their points are within the specified range [25, 71].\n\n4. **Evaluate Each Row**:\n   - Row 0: Points = 71 (Within range)\n   - Row 1: Points = 65 (Within range)\n   - Row 2: Points = 62 (Within range)\n   - Row 3: Points = 62 (Within range)\n   - Row 4: Points = 59 (Within range)\n   - Row 5: Points = 58 (Within range)\n   - Row 6: Points = 57 (Within range)\n   - Row 7: Points = 57 (Within range)\n   - Row 8: Points = 55 (Within range)\n   - Row 9: Points = 53 (Within range)\n   - Row 10: Points = 44 (Within range)\n   - Row 11: Points = 42 (Within range)\n   - Row 12: Points = 40 (Within range)\n   - Row 13: Points = 39 (Within range)\n   - Row 14: Points = 39 (Within range)\n   - Row 15: Points = 38 (Within range)\n   - Row 16: Points = 37 (Within range)\n   - Row 17: Points = 35 (Within range)\n   - Row 18: Points = 34 (Within range)\n   - Row 19: Points = 34 (Within range)\n   - Row 20: Points = 33 (Within range)\n   - Row 21: Points = 33 (Within range)\n   - Row 22: Points = 32 (Within range)\n   - Row 23: Points = 32 (Within range)\n   - Row 24: Points = 25 (Within range)\n\n5. **Conclusion**: All values in the \"points 1\" column are within the specified range of 25 to 71.\n\n6. **Result**:\n   Since every value meets the condition, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states, \"there be no position when play be less than 46,\" which implies that for all teams listed, the number of games played should be exactly 46.\n\nLet's break down our verification process:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We need to look at the column named \"played\" in each row because this column indicates how many games a team has played.\n   \n2. **Check Each Row:**\n   - For each entry (team) in the data section, verify if the value in the \"played\" column is 46.\n\n3. **Verification:**\n   - Iterate through all rows in the data:\n     - Row 0: Boston United - Played = 46\n     - Row 1: Wigan Athletic - Played = 46\n     - Row 2: Bangor City - Played = 46\n     - Row 3: Scarborough - Played = 46\n     - Row 4: Altrincham - Played = 46\n     - Row 5: Northwich Victoria - Played = 46\n     - Row 6: Stafford Rangers - Played = 46\n     - Row 7: Runcorn - Played = 46\n     - Row 8: Mossley - Played = 46\n     - Row 9: Matlock Town - Played = 46\n     - Row 10: Lancaster City - Played = 46\n     - Row 11: Frickley Athletic - Played = 46\n     - Row 12: Barrow - Played = 46\n     - Row 13: Goole Town - Played = 46\n     - Row 14: Great Harwood - Played = 46\n     - Row 15: Gainsborough Trinity - Played = 46\n     - Row 16: Gateshead - Played = 46\n     - Row 17: Netherfield - Played = 46\n     - Row 18: Workington - Played = 46\n     - Row 19: Worksop Town - Played = 46\n     - Row 20: Morecambe - Played = 46\n     - Row 21: Macclesfield Town - Played = 46\n     - Row 22: Buxton - Played = 46\n     - Row 23: South Liverpool - Played = 46\n\nAll teams have played exactly 46 games. There are no discrepancies in the number of games played.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since every team has a \"played\" value of 46, there is indeed \"no position when play be less than 46.\"\n\nGiven that all relevant cells confirm the claim, we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"played\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Buxton draw less than 6 point,\" we need to focus on two main aspects: identifying Buxton's team in the table and checking their number of drawn matches.\n\n1. **Identify Buxton**: We look for the row where the \"team\" column has the value \"buxton.\" From the JSON data, we find that Buxton is listed at position 23 (index 22 if zero-indexed).\n\n2. **Check Draws**: For the identified row of Buxton, we need to examine the \"drawn\" column. This will tell us how many matches they have drawn.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim**: The claim states that Buxton drew less than 6 points. Points in football are typically awarded as follows: a win gives 3 points, a draw gives 1 point, and a loss gives 0 points.
