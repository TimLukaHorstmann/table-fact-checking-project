    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to identify the first game date from the table and compare it to the date mentioned in the claim.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - The relevant column for verifying when games took place is \"kick off\", which contains the dates of the matches.\n\n2. **Extract Dates:**\n   - From the data provided, extract all the dates listed under the \"kick off\" column:\n     - 2006-09-12, 20:45\n     - 2006-09-27, 20:45\n     - 2006-10-18, 20:45\n     - 2006-10-31, 20:45\n     - 2006-11-22, 20:45\n     - 2006-12-05, 20:45\n\n3. **Determine the Earliest Date:**\n   - The earliest date from these is \"2006-09-12\", which corresponds to the first game.\n\n4. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the first game took place on December 9th, 2006.\n   - Comparing this with our determined date of September 12th, 2006, we find a discrepancy.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the earliest game occurred on September 12th, 2006 and not on December 9th, 2006, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant cell for this verification is the first entry in the \"kick off\" column (row index 0).\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"kick off\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
