    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the table data:\n\n**Claim:** \"The screening that started on March 29, 2006, was completed by May 3rd, 2006.\"\n\n**Steps for Verification:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:** \n   - We need to locate the row in which the screening start date is closest to March 29, 2006.\n   - Check if there's a corresponding completion date that matches or is after May 3, 2006.\n\n2. **Analyze the Table:**\n   - Scan through the \"screening started\" column for dates matching or closely surrounding March 29, 2006.\n   - In this table, we find:\n     - Row 5: Screening started on March 9, 2006, and completed on April 28, 2006. This is close but not exactly March 29, 2006.\n     - No exact match for March 29, 2006.\n\n3. **Conclusion from Analysis:**\n   - There's no row with a start date of March 29, 2006. The closest start date before May 3, 2006, is on March 9, 2006, which ends on April 28, 2006.\n   - Since there's no screening that starts exactly on March 29, 2006, the claim cannot be validated with the available data.\n\n4. **Final Determination:**\n   - The claim is FALSE because there is no evidence in the table for a screening starting on March 29, 2006, completing by May 3, 2006.\n\n**JSON Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"screening started\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"screening completed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n- **Relevant Cells Explanation:** \n  - Row index 4 is relevant because it's the closest screening start date before May 3rd, 2006. Both columns are checked to confirm no matching or overlapping data that supports the claim.\n- No other rows provide a closer match for March 29th, confirming the absence of any supporting evidence in the dataset provided.",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table and find the relevant information:\n\nThe claim states: \"the screening that starts on May 3rd, 2006 ends on March 29, 2006.\"\n\n1. **Identify the Row**: We need to look for a row where the \"screening started\" date is \"May 3rd, 2006\". In the table, dates are in various formats; let's convert them to a consistent format (e.g., DD MMMM YYYY):\n   - May 3rd, 2006 becomes 03 may 2006.\n\n2. **Check the Table**:\n   - The \"screening started\" column has entries like \"9 march 2006\", \"27 march 2006\", etc.\n   - We convert these to a consistent format: \n     - \"9 march 2006\" is 09 march 2006\n     - \"27 march 2006\" is 27 march 2006\n\n3. **Find the Matching Date**:\n   - The date \"03 may 2006\" does not appear in the \"screening started\" column.\n\nSince there is no row with a \"screening started\" date of May 3rd, 2006, the claim cannot be true based on the data provided.\n\nThus, the answer is \"FALSE\". There are no relevant cells to verify this specific claim because the start date does not exist in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
