    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"Williams - BMW have a time / retire of + 37.311\" is true or false, we need to analyze the provided table.\n\nThe table includes multiple rows where each row represents data about a driver in a race:\n\n- The relevant column for this query is \"time / retired\", as it contains information on whether a driver completed the race and their finishing time relative to the leader.\n  \n- Another important column is \"constructor\", which identifies the team or constructor associated with each driver.\n\nSteps to verify the claim:\n1. Locate all rows where the constructor is \"Williams - BMW\".\n2. Check the corresponding values in the \"time / retired\" column for these rows.\n3. Determine if any of these values match \"+ 37.311\".\n\nLet's examine the table data:\n\n- The first row with \"Williams - BMW\" as the constructor is:\n  - Row index: 4\n  - Driver: Ralf Schumacher\n  - Time / Retired: + 37.311\n\n- The second row with \"Williams - BMW\" is:\n  - Row index: 16\n  - Driver: Jenson Button\n  - Time / Retired: Engine (not matching the claim)\n\nThe claim specifies that Williams - BMW has a time of \"+ 37.311\". The first instance we found confirms this, as Ralf Schumacher from Williams - BMW indeed has that time.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data, and the relevant cell is row index 4 in the \"time / retired\" column. Therefore, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Find the row with the driver \"pedro de la rosa\":\n   - The entry for \"pedro de la rosa\" is located at `row_index: 19`.\n\n2. Check the number of laps in this row:\n   - According to the table, Pedro de la Rosa completed `1` lap.\n\n3. Compare against the claim:\n   - The claim states that he has more than 25 laps.\n   - Since Pedro de la Rosa completed only 1 lap, this does not satisfy the condition \"more than 25 laps\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is **FALSE** because Pedro de la Rosa did not complete more than 25 laps. We identified relevant data by checking the row and column associated with his number of laps.\n\nHere's the JSON response capturing our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
