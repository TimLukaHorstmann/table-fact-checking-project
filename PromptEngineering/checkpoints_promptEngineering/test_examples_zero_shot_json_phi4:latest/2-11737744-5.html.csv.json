The relevant information can be found under the column named \"australian open\".\n\n### Steps for Evaluation:\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**  \n   The column \"australian open\" contains data about her performances at this tournament.\n\n2. **Check Each Year's Result:**\n   - 2007: \"a\"\n   - 2008: \"a\"\n   - 2009: \"a\"\n   - 2010: \"1r\"\n   - 2011: \"1r\"\n   - 2012: \"a\"\n\n3. **Interpret the Data:**\n   - The notation \"a\" stands for \"absent\", meaning she did not participate in those years.\n   - \"1r\" indicates that she reached the first round, which means she played at least one game and thus didn't lose all of them.\n\n4. **Conclusion from Data:**\n   Since Tatjana Maria participated and reached the first round in both 2010 and 2011, it is clear that she did not lose all her games during those years.

The performance is recorded as:\n- \"a\" indicating absence or no match played.\n- \"nr\" indicating not ranked in that year.\n- \"1r\", \"2r\", etc., indicating the round reached.\n\nThe last column under each tournament and the row at the end represents her win-loss record for that specific tournament over the years.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Tournament's Performance**\n\nLet's extract relevant data from the table:\n\n1. **Australian Open**\n   - Career Win-Loss: \"0 - 3\"\n\n2. **French Open**\n   - Career Win-Loss: \"1 - 2\"\n\n3. **Wimbledon**\n   - Career Win-Loss: \"1 - 4\"\n\n4. **US Open**\n   - Career Win-Loss: \"2 - 3\"\n\n**Step 3: Compare Performances**\n\nTo determine the best performance by record:\n- Look at the win-loss records.\n- A better performance implies more wins and fewer losses.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Australian Open: 0 Wins, 3 Losses\n- French Open: 1 Win, 2 Losses\n- Wimbledon: 1 Win, 4 Losses\n- US Open: 2 Wins, 3 Losses\n\nThe US Open has the best win-loss record with 2 wins and 3 losses.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nThe claim \"she did the best in the US Open by record\" is true based on the comparison of her performance records across tournaments.\n\n**Relevant Cells for Verification**\n- The relevant cells are those under the column \"career win - loss\" for each tournament since they directly show her cumulative performance at each event.\n  \nTherefore, the JSON response would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"career win - loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"career win - loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"career win - loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"career win - loss\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The key part of the claim is \"4 and 12,\" which corresponds to the \"career win - loss\" statistics provided at the end of the table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: \n   - The column that contains career win-loss records for each tournament, as well as overall, is labeled \"win - loss\" in the table.\n   \n2. **Check Overall Career Win-Loss**:\n   - In the last row under the \"win - loss\" column, there's a value of \"4 - 12,\" which represents the player's total career win-loss record across all tournaments from 2007 to 2012.\n\n3. **Verify Against Claim**:\n   - The claim mentions \"4 and 12 in win loss,\" which aligns with the recorded overall career win-loss figure of \"4 - 12.\"\n\nThus, based on the table data, the claim is supported by the information provided under the \"win - loss\" column.\n\nNow, let's structure this into a JSON object specifying the relevant cell:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"win - loss\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The focus is on understanding whether there is a pattern indicating underperformance or inconsistency that might support this claim.\n\n### Analyzing the Table:\n\n1. **Columns and Data**:\n   - **Tournaments**: Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open.\n   - **Years (2007-2012)**: Each year shows how far the player progressed in each tournament.\n   - **Career Win-Loss**: Overall performance across all tournaments up to 2012.\n\n2. **Performance Breakdown**:\n   - **Australian Open**: \n     - Reached Round 1 twice in 2010 and 2011.\n     - Career record: 0 wins, 3 losses (0-3).\n   - **French Open**:\n     - Reached Round 2 once in 2010.\n     - Career record: 1 win, 2 losses (1-2).\n   - **Wimbledon**:\n     - Reached Round 2 once in 2007.\n     - Reached Round 1 twice in 2008 and 2009.\n     - Career record: 1 win, 4 losses (1-4).\n   - **US Open**:\n     - Reached Round 2 twice, in 2009 and 2012.\n     - Reached Round 1 once in 2010.\n     - Career record: 2 wins, 3 losses (2-3).\n\n3. **Overall Performance**:\n   - Yearly Win-Loss records show inconsistency with low success rates each year.\n   - Total career win-loss record is 4-12.\n\n### Evaluating the Claim:\n\nThe claim suggests that the player needs to improve before participating in future events, implying current performance might be lacking or inconsistent. The data supports this view due to:\n\n- Frequent early exits (Round 1) and a few instances of reaching Round 2.\n- An overall negative win-loss record (4 wins vs. 12 losses).\n- Inconsistent yearly performances.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe table indicates underperformance and inconsistency in the player's results across several years, which supports the claim that she needs to work on her craft before future events.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"win - loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2007\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2008\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2009\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2010\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2011\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"career win - loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2007\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2008\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2009\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2010\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"career win - loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2007\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2008\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2009\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"career win - loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2007\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2008\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2009\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2010\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2012\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"career win - loss\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
