According to the data, this is at `row_index: 12`.\n\n3. **Check the MLB Affiliate for 2013**:\n   - Verify that the \"mlb affiliate\" in this row is indeed \"kansas city\". The table confirms this.\n\n4. **Examine Post-Season Record and Win % for 2013**:\n   - Check the columns \"post-season record\" and \"post-season win %\" for `row_index: 12`.\n   - Both fields are marked with \"-\", indicating no post-season record or win percentage is recorded.\n\nGiven these checks, all conditions support the claim that Kansas City had no post-season record in 2013.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"mlb affiliate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"post - season win %\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Houston have no post-season record\" is true or false, we need to inspect the table data for any entries related to the MLB affiliate \"Houston.\" Specifically, we will examine the columns labeled \"post - season record\" and \"post - season win %\" to see if there are any records indicating a post-season performance.\n\nLet's break down the relevant parts of the table:\n\n1. **Identify Rows Related to Houston**: \n   - We need to check all rows where the \"mlb affiliate\" column is \"houston.\"\n\n2. **Check Post-Season Records**:\n   - For each row identified in step 1, we will examine the \"post - season record\" and \"post - season win %\" columns.\n   - If any of these fields contain a value other than \"-\", it would indicate that Houston has had post-season records.\n\n3. **Analysis of Data**:\n   - Row 0: \"post - season record\" is \"4 - 0\", which means there was a post-season record for the year 2001.\n   - Row 2: \"post - season record\" is \"0 - 2\", indicating a post-season record for the year 2003.\n   - Row 5: \"post - season record\" is \"0 - 2\", showing a post-season record for the year 2006.\n\nSince there are entries in the \"post - season record\" column for Houston in rows 0, 2, and 5 that contain values other than \"-\", we can conclude that Houston does have post-season records. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this conclusion include:\n- Row 0: \"post - season record\" and \"post - season win %\"\n- Row 2: \"post - season record\" and \"post - season win %\"\n- Row 5: \"post - season record\" and \"post - season win %\"\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"post - season win %\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"post - season win %\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"post - season win %}\n  ]\n}\n```",
