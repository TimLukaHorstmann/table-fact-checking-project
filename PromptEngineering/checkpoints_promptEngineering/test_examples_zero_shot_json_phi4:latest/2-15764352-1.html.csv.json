    "resp": "To verify the claim \"the first game starts at 14:00 and the second game starts at 14:00,\" we need to examine the relevant cells in the table that contain information about the start times of each game.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Column**:  \n   The column containing the time information is \"time.\"\n\n2. **Check Each Game's Start Time**:\n   - We need to determine the order of games based on their start times.\n   - Extract and sort the data by the \"time\" column.\n\n3. **Extract Data**:\n   - Game 1: [\"2008 - 05 - 10\", \"10:00\", \"toronto eagles\", \"high park demons\", \"98 - 34\", \"humber college north\"]\n     - Start Time: 10:00\n   - Game 2: [\"2008 - 05 - 10\", \"12:00\", \"toronto rebels\", \"toronto downtown dingos\", \"43 - 93\", \"humber college north\"]\n     - Start Time: 12:00\n   - Game 3: [\"2008 - 05 - 10\", \"14:00\", \"broadview hawks\", \"central blues\", \"73 - 47\", \"humber college north\"]\n     - Start Time: 14:00\n   - Game 4: [\"2008 - 05 - 10\", \"14:00\", \"ottawa swans\", \"etobicoke kangaroos\", \"34 - 138\", \"rideau carleton raceway\"]\n     - Start Time: 14:00\n   - Game 5: [\"2008 - 05 - 10\", \"14:00\", \"guelph gargoyles\", \"hamilton wildcats\", \"37 - 27\", \"magaret green park\"]\n     - Start Time: 14:00\n\n4. **Determine the Order of Games**:\n   - Game 1 starts at 10:00.\n   - Game 2 starts at 12:00.\n   - Game 3, Game 4, and Game 5 all start at 14:00.\n\n5. **Identify the First Two Games by Start Time**:\n   - The first game (earliest start time) is at 10:00.\n   - The second game (next earliest start time) is at 12:00.\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the first game starts at 14:00 and the second game starts at 14:00.\n   - Based on our sorted data, this is false because the first game starts at 10:00 and the second game starts at 12:00.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE. The relevant cells for verifying this are those containing the start times of the games.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
