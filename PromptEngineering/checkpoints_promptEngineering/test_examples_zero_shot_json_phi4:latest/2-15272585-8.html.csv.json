    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about Galina Voskoboeva's performance in different surfaces and her winning record, we need to carefully examine each part of the claim against the data provided in the table.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n1. **\"Galina Voskoboeva have an equal winrate between both clay and hard court\":**\n   - We need to check the outcomes on clay and hard surfaces (including \"hard (i)\" which is also a type of hard surface).\n   \n2. **\"...but she never win\":**\n   - This part of the claim suggests that Galina Voskoboeva has no wins at all.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n1. Identify matches played on clay and hard surfaces.\n2. Count the number of wins and losses for each surface type.\n3. Check if there are any winning records in the data.\n\n### Data Analysis:\n\n#### Matches on Clay:\n- **Row 3**: Latina, Clay\n  - Outcome: Runner-up\n  - Opponent: Roberta Vinci\n\n- **Row 5**: Cuneo, Italy, Clay\n  - Outcome: Winner\n  - Opponent: Alice Canepa\n\nClay matches: 1 win, 1 loss.\n\n#### Matches on Hard (including \"hard (i)\"):\n- **Row 1**: Tipton, Hard (i)\n  - Outcome: Runner-up\n  - Opponent: Matea Mezak\n\n- **Row 2**: Mont-de-Marsan, Hard (i)\n  - Outcome: Winner\n  - Opponent: Oleksandra Kravets\n\n- **Row 4**: Pittsburgh, Hard\n  - Outcome: Runner-up\n  - Opponent: Lilia Osterloh\n\nHard matches: 1 win, 2 losses.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Galina Voskoboeva has a win on both clay and hard surfaces, so her winrate is not equal (1 win out of 1 for clay vs. 1 win out of 3 for hard).\n- She has won at least one match, contradicting the claim that she never wins.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nTo verify the claim, we need to look at all rows and columns related to \"outcome,\" \"surface,\" and \"winner/loser\" status.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to assess two specific conditions from the table: \n\n1. **Identify Matches with Oleksandra Kravets and Alice Canepa**: We need to find instances in the data where Galina Voskoboeva played against either Oleksandra Kravets or Alice Canepa.\n\n2. **Calculate Points Lost Against Each Opponent**:\n   - For each match, we must calculate how many points Galina Voskoboeva lost based on the scores provided in the table.\n   - A tennis game is won by the first player to reach 4 points with at least a 2-point lead. If neither reaches 4 points or if they reach deuce (40-40), additional points are played until one player has a 2-point advantage.\n\n3. **Average Points Lost**: Calculate the average number of points lost in matches against Oleksandra Kravets and Alice Canepa.\n\nLet's break down each relevant match:\n\n### Match with Oleksandra Kravets\n- **Date**: 29 June 2003\n- **Outcome**: Winner\n- **Score**: 6 - 4, 6 - 2\n\nSince Galina won this match, she did not lose any points in terms of game results (as the opponent's scores represent her wins). Therefore, the points lost by Galina are equivalent to Oleksandra Kravets' total games: 4 + 2 = 6 points.\n\n### Match with Alice Canepa\n- **Date**: 6 June 2006\n- **Outcome**: Winner\n- **Score**: 6 - 1, 6 - 2\n\nSimilarly, since Galina won this match, the points lost by her are equal to Alice Canepa's total games: 1 + 2 = 3 points.\n\n### Calculate Average Points Lost\nNow, we calculate the average points lost across these two matches:\n\n- Total points lost = 6 (against Oleksandra Kravets) + 3 (against Alice Canepa) = 9 points.\n- Number of matches = 2\n\nAverage points lost = Total points lost / Number of matches = 9 / 2 = 4.5 points.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim states that Galina Voskoboeva loses with only 4 points on average against these opponents, but our calculation shows an average of 4.5 points lost. Therefore, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\nRelevant cells for verification are:\n- The matches where she played against Oleksandra Kravets and Alice Canepa.\n- The scores in those matches to determine the points lost.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
