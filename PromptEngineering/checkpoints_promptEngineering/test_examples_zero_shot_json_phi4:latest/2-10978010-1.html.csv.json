    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to carefully analyze each component against the data in the table:\n\n1. **Claim Analysis**:\n   - \"the annual ridership in 2012 be 123219300\"\n   - \"the rider per mile be 4056\"\n   - \"and there be 44 station\"\n\n2. **Table Structure**:\n   - The table consists of five columns: \"annual ridership (2012)\", \"rider per mile\", \"opened\", \"stations\", and \"lines\".\n   - Each row in the data section corresponds to a record with values for these columns.\n\n3. **Verifying Claim Components**:\n\n   - For the first part of the claim, we need to find where \"annual ridership (2012)\" is 123219300.\n     - Looking at each row, this value appears in the fifth row (`index 4`).\n\n   - Next, verify that the \"rider per mile\" for the same row is 4056.\n     - Checking the same fifth row (`index 4`), we see that \"rider per mile\" is indeed 4056.\n\n   - Finally, check if there are 44 stations in the same row.\n     - Again, examining the fifth row (`index 4`), it shows that there are 44 stations.\n\nAll parts of the claim are satisfied by the data at row index 4. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The cells relevant to verifying this claim are in row index 4.\n   - Column names: \"annual ridership (2012)\", \"rider per mile\", and \"stations\".\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"annual ridership (2012)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"rider per mile\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"stations\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"5 line have more than 10000 rider per mile,\" we must examine each entry in the dataset under two specific conditions:\n1. The number of lines is exactly 5.\n2. For those entries, check if the value in \"rider per mile\" exceeds 10,000.\n\nThe relevant columns for this verification are \"lines\" and \"rider per mile.\"\n\nLet's analyze the data:\n\n- **Entry 0**: Lines = 24 (Does not meet condition)\n- **Entry 1**: Lines = 5; Rider per mile = 9227 (Fails second condition)\n- **Entry 2**: Lines = 8 (Does not meet condition)\n- **Entry 3**: Lines = 3 (Does not meet condition)\n- **Entry 4**: Lines = 5; Rider per mile = 4056 (Fails second condition)\n- **Entry 5**: Lines = 3 (Does not meet condition)\n- **Entry 6**: Lines = 4 (Does not meet condition)\n- **Entry 7**: Lines = 4 (Does not meet condition)\n- **Entry 8**: Lines = 2 (Does not meet condition)\n- **Entry 9**: Lines = 2 (Does not meet condition)\n- **Entry 10**: Lines = 1 (Does not meet condition)\n- **Entry 11**: Lines = 1 (Does not meet condition)\n- **Entry 12**: Lines = 1 (Does not meet condition)\n- **Entry 13**: Lines = 1 (Does not meet condition)\n- **Entry 14**: Lines = 1 (Does not meet condition)\n\nOnly entries with exactly 5 lines were checked: Entry 1 and Entry 4.
