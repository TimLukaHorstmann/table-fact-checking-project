We will examine each row within this column to see if any entry includes the term \"guard\" in its value.\n\nLet's review each row under the \"position\" column:\n\n1. Row 0: \"bobby jackson\", Position - \"guard\"\n   - This matches our condition of having a player who plays the position of \"guard\".\n   \n2. Row 1: \"casey jacobsen\", Position - \"guard - forward\"\n   - This also includes \"guard\" in the position.\n   \n3. Row 2: \"alexander johnson\", Position - \"power forward\"\n   - Does not match as it only mentions \"power forward\".\n   \n4. Row 3: \"chris johnson\", Position - \"small forward\"\n   - Does not mention \"guard\".\n   \n5. Row 4: \"bobby jones\", Position - \"forward\"\n   - Does not include \"guard\".\n   \n6. Row 5: \"dahntay jones\", Position - \"guard - forward\"\n   - Includes \"guard\" in the position.\n   \n7. Row 6: \"damon jones\", Position - \"shooting guard\"\n   - The term \"shooting guard\" implies a type of \"guard\".\n\nFrom this examination, we can see that there are multiple entries where players have played the position of \"guard\". Specifically, rows 0, 1, 5, and 6 meet the condition.\n\nThe claim states that there is \"1 player who play the position of guard,\" which implies exactly one player should match. However, as we identified four players (from rows 0, 1, 5, and 6), the claim does not hold true because there are more than one such players.\n\nThus, the answer to whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE is \"FALSE\".\n\nHere's the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Since he is listed with a single entry for nationality (\"united states\"), this supports the claim.\n   - There are no indications or additional entries suggesting multiple nationalities in the table.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The table confirms that Casey Jacobsen has only one nationality, which matches the claim.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the claim is true.
