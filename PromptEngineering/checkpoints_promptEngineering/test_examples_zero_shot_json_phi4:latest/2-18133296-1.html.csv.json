    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"government 31 have the Kadima party\" is true or false, we need to check which row in the table corresponds to government 31 and verify the associated political party for that entry.\n\n1. **Identify Government 31:**\n   - We scan through the data in the \"governments\" column to find entries containing \"31\".\n   - The relevant entry is found at row index 20, where the \"governments\" value is \"31\".\n\n2. **Verify Party for Government 31:**\n   - Check the \"party\" column at the same row (row index 20) to see if it matches \"Kadima\".\n   - At row index 20, under the \"party\" column, the entry is indeed \"kadima\".\n\nSince both conditions are met (government number 31 and the party Kadima), the claim is supported by the table.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"governments\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"party\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"government 31 start before 18 January 2006\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to identify and verify specific details:\n\n1. **Identify Government Number**: The claim involves government number 31.\n2. **Find Relevant Data for Government 31**: Locate the row in the data where \"government 31\" is mentioned in the \"governments\" column.\n3. **Check the Start Date**: Once identified, examine the \"term start\" date for this specific government to see if it starts before 18 January 2006.\n\nLet's go through the steps with the provided table:\n\n- We search for the entry where the number 31 appears in the \"governments\" column. This is found in row index 20.\n- In this row, we find the following details:\n  - **Minister**: Tzipi Livni\n  - **Party**: Kadima\n  - **Governments**: 31\n  - **Term Start**: 18 January 2006\n  - **Term End**: 1 April 2009\n\nNow let's analyze the claim:\n\n- The claim states that \"government 31 start before 18 January 2006.\"\n- From our examination, we see that government 31 actually starts on 18 January 2006.\n- Therefore, it does not start *before* this date.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false. Here are the relevant cells:\n\n1. Row index 20, column \"governments\" (government number)\n2. Row index 20, column \"term start\" (start date)\n\nThus, the JSON object representing our conclusion is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"governments\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"term start\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
