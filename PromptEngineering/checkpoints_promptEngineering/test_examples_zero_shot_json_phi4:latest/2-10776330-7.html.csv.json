    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"during the 1961 VFL season, MCG venue recorded the highest crowd participation\" is true or false, we need to examine the table's data for relevant information.\n\nThe key columns relevant to this claim are:\n- **Venue**: To identify which match was held at the MCG.\n- **Crowd**: To compare the attendance numbers across all matches.\n\nWe will go through each row in the \"data\" array and check these two columns. Our goal is to find out if the MCG had the highest crowd number on 3 June 1961, as per the data provided.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the match at MCG**:\n   - Look for the row where the \"venue\" column contains \"mcg\". This is in row index 5.\n   - The crowd for this match is given as 49678.\n\n2. **Compare the crowd numbers**:\n   - Check the \"crowd\" column across all rows to see if any other match had a higher attendance than 49678.\n\n3. **Data Review**:\n   - Row 0: Arden Street Oval, Crowd = 13000\n   - Row 1: Glenferrie Oval, Crowd = 15000\n   - Row 2: Victoria Park, Crowd = 28290\n   - Row 3: Kardinia Park, Crowd = 18683\n   - Row 4: Lake Oval, Crowd = 14500\n   - Row 5 (MCG): Crowd = 49678\n\nAfter reviewing all the rows, we observe that the MCG match had a crowd of 49678, which is higher than any other match on that date.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim states that the MCG recorded the highest crowd participation during the matches listed for 3 June 1961. \n- Based on our analysis, this statement is TRUE because no other venue had a higher attendance number than 49678 at the MCG.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row index 5, \"venue\" (to identify it as MCG).\n- Row index 5, \"crowd\" (to confirm the highest crowd number).\n- All rows' \"crowd\" column entries for comparison purposes.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

This occurs in the 5th row (index 4).\n   - For Glenferrie Oval, we look for the row where the \"venue\" is \"glenferrie oval\". This occurs in the 2nd row (index 1).\n\n2. **Extract the relevant crowd data**:\n   - From the 5th row (index 4), under the \"crowd\" column, the attendance at Lake Oval was 14,500.\n   - From the 2nd row (index 1), under the \"crowd\" column, the attendance at Glenferrie Oval was 15,000.\n\n3. **Compare the crowd numbers**:\n   - Lake Oval: 14,500\n   - Glenferrie Oval: 15,000\n\nSince 14,500 is less than 15,000, the claim that \"Lake Oval venue recorded a higher crowd participation than that of the Glenferrie Oval venue\" is FALSE.\n\n4. **List the relevant cells**:\n   - For Lake Oval's crowd attendance: Row index 4, Column name \"crowd\".\n   - For Glenferrie Oval's crowd attendance: Row index 1, Column name \"crowd\".\n\nNow we can construct the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
