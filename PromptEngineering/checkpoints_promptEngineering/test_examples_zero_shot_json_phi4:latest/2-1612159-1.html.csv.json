The positions for each season are as follows (extracted from the \"pos\" column):\n\n- 1992: 8\n- 1993: 17\n- 1994: 2\n- 1995: 14\n- 1996: 11\n- 1997: 13\n- 1998: 6\n- 1999: 7\n- 2000: 12\n- 2001: 12\n- 2002: 11\n- 2003: 11\n- 2004: 12\n- 2005: 13\n- 2006: 12\n- 2007: 16\n- 2008: 1 (lowest position)\n- 2009: 14\n- 2010: 9\n- 2011 - 12: 13\n- 2012 - 13: 13\n\nThe lowest position achieved is 1, which occurred in the 2008 season. Therefore, the claim that the 2011-2012 season resulted in the lowest position is false.\n\n### Condition 2: Head Coach(s)\n\nFor the 2011-2012 season, we need to verify if the head coach(s) were \"protasov lyutyi talalayev balakhnin baidachny\". The relevant data from the table for this season is:\n\n- Season: 2011 - 12\n- Head Coach: \"protasov lyutyi talalayev balakhnin baidachny\"\n\nThis condition is true as the head coaches listed match exactly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the first condition (lowest position) is false, the overall claim is false. \n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n\n- The row for the 2011-2012 season for both \"pos\" and \"head coach\".\n- The row for the 2008 season for \"pos\" to identify the lowest position.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"pos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"head coach\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"pos\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two main conditions from the table:\n\n1.
