The album \"fantasy black channel\" must be associated with the label \"astralwerks.\"\n2. This association must occur in the United States.\n\nLet's break down the claim verification step by step using the provided table data:\n\n- **Label Verification**: We check if any entry in the table lists \"astralwerks\" as the label.\n  - From the table, we find:\n    - Row with index 4: The label is \"astralwerks.\"\n    - Row with index 5: The label is also \"astralwerks.\"\n\n- **Region Verification**: We check if these entries correspond to the United States.\n  - For row 4 (index starts at 0), the region is \"United states.\"\n  - For row 5, the region is again \"united states.\"\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied in rows 4 and 5. Thus, the claim that \"'fantasy black channel' be release on the astralwerks label in the united state\" is supported by these entries.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Row index 4: The \"region,\" \"label,\" and \"catalog\" columns are relevant.\n- Row index 5: The same columns (\"region,\" \"label,\" and \"catalog\") are relevant.\n\nHere's the JSON output with the answer and the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"region\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"label\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"catalog\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"region\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"label\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"catalog\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
