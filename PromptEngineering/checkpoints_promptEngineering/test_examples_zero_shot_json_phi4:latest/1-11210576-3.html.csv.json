    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim \"christian de la fuente's duration be 02x03 - 03x05,\" we need to examine relevant data in the provided table.\n\nThe table is structured with columns indicating various attributes like character, position, actor, first episode, final episode, duration, and final episode count. The row entries consist of corresponding values for each attribute.\n\n1. Identify the rows involving \"christian de la fuente\":\n   - Look through the column labeled \"actor\" to find \"christian de la fuente.\"\n\n2. Verify the information regarding this actor:\n   - Once identified, examine the value in the \"duration\" column to see if it matches the claim.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. We find that \"christian de la fuente\" is associated with the character \"sam belmontes,\" position \"trace technician.\"\n\n2. In row 13 of the table (where \"sam belmontes\" is listed), check the value in the \"duration\" column:\n   - The duration specified for \"sam belmontes\" is indeed \"02x03 - 03x05.\"\n\nThe claim matches exactly with the data found in the relevant cell.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"actor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"duration\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"the final episode for DEA agent be title vengeance\" is true or false, we need to verify two main conditions from the table:\n1. The character must be a \"DEA agent.\"\n2. The final episode of that character's appearances must have the title \"vengeance.\"\n\nLet's examine the data provided in the JSON format:\n\n- First, locate all rows where the position is \"dea agent.\" This information can be found in the second column labeled \"position.\"\n- Once we identify the relevant row(s), check if the final episode for that character matches the episode titled \"vengeance,\" which is specified in the fifth column labeled \"final episode.\"\n\nWe go through the table and locate the entry with \"dea agent\" under the position:\n\n- The entry at `row_index 15` corresponds to a DEA agent named \"bob keaton.\"\n  - Position: \"dea agent\"\n  - Final Episode: \"vengeance\"\n\nThis matches both conditions outlined in our claim:\n1. The character is indeed identified as a DEA agent.\n2. The final episode title listed for this character is \"vengeance.\"\n\nThus, the table supports the claim fully.\n\nThe relevant cells that confirm the validity of this claim are from `row_index 15` and involve checking both the position and the final episode columns:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"final episode\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
