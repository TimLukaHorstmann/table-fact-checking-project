    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"the only venue on 3 may 1980 was Victoria Park,\" we must analyze the data provided in the table for games played on this date.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: Focus on the columns `venue`, and `date` since they contain information about where each game took place and when it occurred.\n   \n2. **Filter by Date**: Check which rows have the date \"3 may 1980\". According to the provided data, all entries are for this specific date.\n\n3. **Check Venues**:\n   - **Row 0**: Venue is \"mcg\".\n   - **Row 1**: Venue is \"victoria park\".\n   - **Row 2**: Venue is \"princes park\".\n   - **Row 3**: Venue is \"junction oval\".\n   - **Row 4**: Venue is \"arden street oval\".\n   - **Row 5**: Venue is \"vfl park\".\n\nThe claim states that the only venue on this date was Victoria Park. However, we observe multiple venues (mcg, princes park, junction oval, arden street oval, and vfl park) were used in addition to Victoria Park.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince there are other venues besides Victoria Park listed for games played on \"3 may 1980\", the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nWe need to list all the relevant cells that confirm this conclusion, specifically focusing on those that contain the `venue` and ensure the date matches.
