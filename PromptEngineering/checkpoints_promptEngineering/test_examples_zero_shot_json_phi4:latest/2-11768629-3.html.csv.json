    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the game attendance and opponent details, we need to evaluate each part of the claim against the data in the table.\n\n**Claim Breakdown:**\n1. The game had an attendance of 18,843.\n2. The opponent was Panathinaikos.\n3. It was a \"fr\" round on 25 October.\n\n**Verification Process:**\n\n- **Attendance Check:** \n  - We need to find which row has an attendance value of 18,843.\n  - From the data:\n    - Row with index 2 (0-based) has an attendance of 8,154.\n    - Row with index 3 has an attendance of 18,843.\n\n- **Opponent Check:**\n  - For the row identified by the attendance check (index 3), we check the \"opponent\" column value.\n  - The opponent listed for this row is Locomotiv Moscow, not Panathinaikos.\n\n- **Round and Date Check:**\n  - Still considering row index 3:\n    - Round is \"gs\".\n    - Date is 8 November.\n  \nFrom these checks, we can see that the conditions do not match those specified in the claim. The attendance of 18,843 corresponds to a game against Locomotiv Moscow on 8 November with a \"gs\" round, not Panathinaikos on 25 October with an \"fr\" round.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe claim is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n\n- Attendance cell at row index 3.\n- Opponent cell at row index 3.\n- Round and date cells at row index 3 (for attendance verification).\n- Row index 2 for date check of \"25 October\" with \"fr\" round opponent Panathinaikos.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
