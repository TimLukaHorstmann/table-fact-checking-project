Now, let's specify the relevant cells used to verify this claim:\n\n- Row index 0 in the column \"place\" confirms Kenny Perry is in first place.\n- Row index 0 in the column \"score\" verifies the score of 66 for Kenny Perry.\n\nHere's the JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

For Greg Norman, it's 68.\n  \n- Verify Country for Greg Norman:\n  - Under the column labeled \"country\", Greg Norman is associated with \"australia\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- **Score Check:** Greg Norman\u2019s score is 68, not 67. This already disproves the claim based on the score condition.\n- **Country Check:** Greg Norman is from Australia, not the United States.\n\nSince both conditions (score and country) do not match the claim, it is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The row index for Greg Norman in the table is 7.\n- Relevant columns to verify are \"player\", \"score\", and \"country\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
