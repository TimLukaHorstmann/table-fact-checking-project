    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the game play on December 6, 1964 be after week 13\" is true or false, we need to examine two specific pieces of information from the table: the date and the corresponding week number for that date.\n\n1. **Identify the Date**: The claim refers specifically to a game played on \"December 6, 1964.\"\n\n2. **Locate the Row with the Date**: From the given data, we locate the row where the date is \"December 6, 1964.\" This corresponds to:\n   - `row_index: 12`\n   - Column name for the date: `\"date\"`\n   \n3. **Check the Week Number**: Next, we verify the week number associated with this date:\n   - The same row (`row_index: 12`) has a corresponding week number in the \"week\" column.\n   - For `row_index: 12`, the value in the \"week\" column is `13`.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**: According to the claim, the game on December 6, 1964, should occur after Week 13. However, from our inspection:\n   - The game on December 6, 1964, actually occurs during Week 13.\n\nTherefore, the claim that this game occurred \"after week 13\" is false.\n\nBased on this evaluation, we construct the JSON response with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Therefore, the claim cannot be true based on the provided data.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThere are no relevant cells because the specified date does not exist in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
