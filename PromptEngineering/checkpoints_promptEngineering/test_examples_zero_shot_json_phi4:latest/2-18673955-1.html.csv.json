    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, let's break it down and analyze the relevant parts of the table.\n\n**Claim:** \"There be no game that be play on October 30, 1977 that be list greater than week 7.\"\n\n1. **Identify games played on October 30, 1977:**\n   - The date column in the data reveals that there is a game listed on October 30, 1977.\n\n2. **Determine the corresponding week for this game:**\n   - From the table's data:\n     - Row with `date` \"October 30, 1977\" corresponds to row index 6.\n     - The value in the `week` column for this row is 7.\n\n3. **Check if there are any games listed after week 7 on October 30, 1977:**\n   - We need to verify that no other game is listed under the same date \"October 30, 1977\" beyond week 7.\n   - By examining all rows in the `date` column, we find only one entry for \"October 30, 1977,\" which is at row index 6 with `week` 7.\n\nSince there are no additional games listed on October 30, 1977 after week 7, the claim holds true. The relevant cells to verify this include those that provide information about the date and week for each game.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
