    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Raymond Felton be 6 - 2 in height\" is true or false, we need to evaluate the relevant data from the table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - The claim is about Raymond Felton's height.\n   - In the table, each player's information is stored as a list within the \"data\" array.\n   - We look for the row that contains \"Raymond Felton\".\n\n2. **Locate the Row**:\n   - By examining the data, we find Raymond Felton in the fourth entry (index 3):\n     ```\n     [\n       \"raymond felton\",\n       \"6 - 2\",\n       \"latta high school\",\n       \"latta , sc\",\n       \"north carolina\",\n       \"1st round - 5th pick of 2005 draft ( bobcats )\"\n     ]\n     ```\n\n3. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Raymond Felton's height is \"6 - 2\".\n   - In the relevant row, the \"height\" column for Raymond Felton is indeed listed as \"6 - 2\".\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the data supports the claim, we conclude that the statement is true.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cell for this verification is in row index 3 under the \"height\" column.\n\nHere's the JSON response with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"height\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"Raymond Felton be the player who be 6 - 2 and his hometown be Aron, OH\", we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. The player's name is Raymond Felton.\n2. This player has a height of \"6 - 2\".\n3. This player's hometown is \"Aron, OH\".\n\nLet's examine these conditions using the data provided in the table:\n\n- **Condition 1**: Identify if there is a player named \"Raymond Felton\" in the table.\n  - From the row where \"player\" is listed as \"raymond felton\", we know that this condition is met.\n\n- **Condition 2**: Check Raymond Felton's height to see if it matches \"6 - 2\".\n  - The data shows that for \"raymond felton\", the \"height\" column lists \"6 - 2\". This condition is satisfied.\n\n- **Condition 3**: Verify if Raymond Felton's hometown is \"Aron, OH\".\n  - According to the table, the \"hometown\" for \"raymond felton\" is listed as \"latta, sc\", not \"Aron, OH\". Thus, this condition is not met.\n\nSince Condition 3 is false (the hometown does not match), the claim itself is false. Now, we identify the relevant cells from the table that correspond to these conditions:\n\n- The player's name: Row index 3, column \"player\".\n- The height of the player: Row index 3, column \"height\".\n- The hometown of the player: Row index 3, column \"hometown\".\n\nTherefore, the JSON object indicating the answer and relevant cells is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"height\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"hometown\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
