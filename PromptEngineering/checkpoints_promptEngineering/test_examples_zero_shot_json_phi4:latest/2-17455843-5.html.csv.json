    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze the relevant parts of the table based on the information given in the claim.\n\n### Claim Analysis\n\nThe claim states:\n- \"The biggest margin of victory comes when Everton defeats Tottenham Hotspur 6 - 0.\"\n\nThis requires us to:\n1. Identify if there is any match where Everton defeated another team with a score difference of 6 goals.\n2. Verify whether this margin (a 6-goal difference) is indeed the largest in the table, and that the opponent was Tottenham Hotspur.\n\n### Steps to Verification\n\n1. **Locate Matches Involving Everton:**\n   - From the data provided, look for rows where \"Everton\" appears as the home team or away team.\n   - Identify scores associated with these matches.\n\n2. **Check Match Results and Margins:**\n   - Calculate the goal difference for each match (i.e., absolute value of the score).\n   - Note down any match where the margin is 6 goals.\n\n3. **Verify Opponent and Date:**\n   - Check if the opponent in a 6-goal victory by Everton was indeed \"Tottenham Hotspur.\"\n   - Confirm this match occurred on \"24 January 1931\" as per the date requirement in the claim.\n\n4. **Compare All Margins:**\n   - Examine all matches to find the maximum goal difference.\n   - Determine if any other match has a larger margin than 6 goals.\n\n### Applying Verification\n\n- **Identifying Everton's Matches:**\n  - Row with tie no \"12\" shows Everton defeating Crystal Palace, 6 - 0 on \"24 January 1931.\"\n\n- **Checking Tottenham Hotspur's Match:**\n  - No match in the table lists Tottenham Hotspur as being defeated by any team, let alone with a margin of 6 goals.\n  - The only involvement for Tottenham Hotspur is against West Bromwich Albion (tie no \"7\"), where they lost 1 - 0.\n\n- **Maximum Margin:**\n  - Everton's win over Crystal Palace had the highest goal difference in the table at 6 goals.\n  - No other match exceeds this margin.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is incorrect for two reasons:\n- Everton did not defeat Tottenham Hotspur, nor any team with a 6-goal margin on the specified date.\n- Although Everton's victory over Crystal Palace had the largest margin of victory in the table, it was not against Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nThus, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
