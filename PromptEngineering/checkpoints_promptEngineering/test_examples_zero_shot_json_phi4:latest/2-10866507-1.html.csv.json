    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the stadium information for the games on two specific dates: 12 August 2007 and 28 July 2007.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information**: \n   - The claim involves comparing the \"stadium\" where the matches were held on:\n     - 12 August 2007\n     - 28 July 2007\n\n2. **Locate Data for 12 August 2007**:\n   - Find the row with the date \"12 august 2007\".\n   - From the data, this is row index 4.\n   - Check the stadium name in column \"stadium\" for this row: \"hindmarsh stadium\".\n\n3. **Locate Data for 28 July 2007**:\n   - Find the row with the date \"28 july 2007\".\n   - From the data, this is row index 2.\n   - Check the stadium name in column \"stadium\" for this row: \"darwin football stadium\".\n\n4. **Compare Stadium Names**:\n   - For 12 August 2007, the stadium was \"hindmarsh stadium\".\n   - For 28 July 2007, the stadium was \"darwin football stadium\".\n   - Since \"hindmarsh stadium\" is not the same as \"darwin football stadium\", the claim is false.\n\n5. **Determine Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells are those containing the stadium names for the specified dates.\n   - For 12 August 2007, this is row index 4 in the \"stadium\" column.\n   - For 28 July 2007, this is row index 2 in the \"stadium\" column.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that the stadiums are the same is false. The relevant cells for verification are those containing the stadium information for the specified dates.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
