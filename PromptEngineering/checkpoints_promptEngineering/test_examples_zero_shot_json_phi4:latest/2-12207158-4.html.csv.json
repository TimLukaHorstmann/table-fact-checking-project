    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table and check how many games were played against each team in June 1989. The claim states that \"the Blue Jays play more games against the Brewers than against any other team in June 1989.\" \n\nFirstly, let's identify all the teams mentioned in the data:\n\n1. Red Sox\n2. Brewers\n3. Tigers\n4. Mariners\n5. Angels\n6. Athletics\n7. Orioles\n\nNext, we need to count how many games were played against each team:\n\n- **Red Sox**: \n  - June 2\n  - June 3\n  - June 4\n  - June 30\n  - Total: 4 games\n\n- **Brewers**:\n  - June 5\n  - June 6\n  - June 7\n  - June 13\n  - June 14\n  - June 15\n  - Total: 6 games\n\n- **Tigers**:\n  - June 9\n  - June 10\n  - June 11\n  - June 12\n  - Total: 4 games\n\n- **Mariners**:\n  - June 16\n  - June 17\n  - June 18\n  - Total: 3 games\n\n- **Angels**:\n  - June 19\n  - June 20\n  - June 21\n  - Total: 3 games\n\n- **Athletics**:\n  - June 22\n  - June 23\n  - June 24\n  - June 25\n  - Total: 4 games\n\n- **Orioles**:\n  - June 27\n  - June 28\n  - June 29\n  - Total: 3 games\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that the team with the most games played against them is the Brewers, with a total of 6 games. However, the claim specifically mentions \"the Blue Jays,\" but there are no entries for games against the Blue Jays in the provided data.\n\nSince the table does not include any games against the Blue Jays, it is impossible for them to have played more games against the Brewers than any other team. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells that support this conclusion:\n\n- The \"opponent\" column entries for each game are relevant to verify which teams were played against.\n- Specifically, the rows where the opponent is \"Brewers\" are directly relevant to count their games.\n\nRelevant cells are those in the \"opponent\" column where the value is \"Brewers\":\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
