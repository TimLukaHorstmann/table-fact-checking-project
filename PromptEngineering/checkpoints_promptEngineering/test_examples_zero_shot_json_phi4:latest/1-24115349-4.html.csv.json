We are interested in the column that provides Kennedy's vote percentage, which is labeled as `\"kennedy %\"`.\n\n3. **Verify the Value:**\n   - In the table, we check the value in the `\"kennedy %\"` column for the row where `\"county\"` is \"bristol.\"\n\n4. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Kennedy won \"1.2%\" of the vote.
