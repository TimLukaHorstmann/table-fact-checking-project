Identify the row corresponding to week 1.\n2. Verify that the time column for this row indicates a start time of 9:00 pm.\n\nLet's examine the table data:\n\n- The table has columns named \"week\", \"date\", \"opponent\", \"time (et)\", \"result\", \"record\", and \"game site\".\n- We focus on the first row, as it corresponds to week 1.\n- In this first row:\n  - The value under \"week\" is `1`, confirming that it's indeed week 1.\n  - The value under \"time (et)\" is `\"9:00 pm\"`.\n\nBoth conditions match what is required to verify the claim.
