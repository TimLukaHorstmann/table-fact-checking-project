    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim \"in 1970 - 1996 the citation be it 's an honour\", we need to check two main conditions in the table:\n\n1. Identify entries with employment dates overlapping or including the range 1970 to 1996.\n2. Verify that for these identified entries, the citation is indeed \"it's an honour\".\n\nLet's analyze each row of the data:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Employment: 1951 - 2000\n  - Citation: it 's an honour\n  - This overlaps with 1970 - 1996 and has the correct citation.\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Employment: 1981 - 2001\n  - Citation: it 's an honour\n  - This partially overlaps with 1970 - 1996 (from 1981 to 1996) and has the correct citation.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Employment: 1973 - 1995\n  - Citation: it 's an honour\n  - This fully falls within 1970 - 1996 and has the correct citation.\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Employment: 1970 - 1996\n  - Citation: it 's an honour\n  - This exactly matches the specified range and has the correct citation.\n\n- **Row 4**: \n  - Employment: 1970 - 2005\n  - Citation: it 's an honour\n  - This overlaps with 1970 - 1996 and has the correct citation.\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Employment: 1966 - 1996\n  - Citation: it 's an honour\n  - This overlaps with 1970 - 1996 and has the correct citation.\n\nAll rows that overlap or match the period from 1970 to 1996 have \"it's an honour\" as their citation.

The name \"Clive Thomas Woosnam\".\n2. His employment period.\n3. His position held during that time.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Name:**\n   - We need to find the row in the table where the name matches \"Clive Thomas Woosnam\". In the data, this corresponds to:\n     ```json\n     [\n       \"woosnam , clive thomas\",\n       \"1970 - 2005\",\n       \"senior boarding master & registrar\",\n       \"medal of the order of australia\",\n       \"it 's an honour\"\n     ]\n     ```\n   - This is found in row index `4`.\n\n2. **Employment Period:**\n   - The claim specifies the employment period as \"1970 to 2005\". We need to check if this matches the data.\n   - In the identified row, the \"employed\" column shows \"1970 - 2005\", which matches exactly with the claim.\n\n3. **Position Held:**\n   - The claim states his position was \"senior boarding master & registrar\".\n   - In the same row, the \"position held\" column confirms this as \"senior boarding master & registrar\".\n\nSince all conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data in the table:\n\n- Name matches.\n- Employment period is correct.\n- Position held is accurately described.\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by the data.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe answer to the claim is \"TRUE\".
