    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"Dwight Phillips was the first person to set a long jump record\" is true or false, we need to analyze the provided table for relevant information.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim asserts that Dwight Phillips was the first to achieve a notable performance in long jump, which would imply setting either an all-time record or a significant milestone.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Table**:\n   - We are looking at the \"mark\" column to identify long jump distances.\n   - The table provides several entries with their respective dates, allowing us to determine the chronology of records.\n   - The key is to find if any entry predates Dwight Phillips' performance.\n\n3. **Checking Dwight Phillips' Entry**:\n   - Dwight Phillips has a record of \"8.74 m\" on June 7, 2009.\n\n4. **Comparing with Other Entries**:\n   - We need to check each row to see if there is any entry with a greater distance or an equivalent distance that was achieved earlier than June 7, 2009.\n   - The entries are as follows:\n     - Mike Powell: \"8.95 m\" on August 30, 1991\n     - Bob Beamon: \"8.90 m\" on October 18, 1968\n     - Carl Lewis: \"8.87 m\" on August 30, 1991\n     - Robert Emmiyan: \"8.86 m\" on May 22, 1987\n     - Larry Myricks: \"8.74 m\" on July 18, 1988\n     - Erick Walder: \"8.74 m\" on April 2, 1994\n     - Irving Saladino: \"8.73 m\" on May 24, 2008\n     - Iv\u00e1n Pedroso: \"8.71 m\" on July 18, 1995\n     - Lo\u00fais Ts\u00e1toumas: \"8.66 m\" on June 2, 2007\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - There are several entries with greater distances than Dwight Phillips' record.\n   - The earliest entry is Bob Beamon's in 1968, which is significantly earlier and longer.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim that \"Dwight Phillips was the first person to set a long jump record\" is false. Dwight Phillips did not have the longest mark nor was he the first to achieve any significant milestone in long jump according to the data provided.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are those containing Dwight Phillips' entry and any entries with longer marks or earlier dates:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mark\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"mark\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"mark\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"mark\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"mark\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"mark\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"mark\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
