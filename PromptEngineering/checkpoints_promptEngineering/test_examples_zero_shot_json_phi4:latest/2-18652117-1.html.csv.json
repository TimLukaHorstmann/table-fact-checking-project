Tony Lorick is indeed the player who was picked as number 7.\n\n- From row index 6, we see:\n  - `pick` column value is 7 which matches the claim about the pick number.\n  - `player` column value is \"Tony Lorick\" which matches the player's name in the claim.\n  \nHowever,\n- The `team` column for this row shows \"Oakland\", not \"Denver\".\n\nSince the team associated with pick number 7 is \"Oakland\" and not \"Denver\", the claim is false. Hence, relevant cells to verify these conditions include those from the seventh row (index 6 in zero-based indexing) related to \"pick,\" \"team,\" and \"player\".",
