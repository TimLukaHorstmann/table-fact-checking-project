This same team should have a try total (sum of tries for and against) of 22.\n\nLet's examine each step based on the provided table data:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Teams with 21 Points\n\nFrom the \"points\" column, we need to find any teams that have scored exactly 21 points. The relevant rows are as follows:\n\n- **Row Index 8**: `caerau ely rfc` has 22 points.\n- **Row Index 9**: `llandrindod wells rfc` has 21 points.\n\n### Step 2: Check Try Totals for Teams with 21 Points\n\nNow, let's verify the try totals (tries for + tries against) for each team identified in step 1:\n\n#### For Row Index 8 (`caerau ely rfc`):\n- **Tries for**: 21\n- **Tries against**: 33\n- **Try Total**: \\(21 + 33 = 54\\)\n\nSince the try total is not 22, this team does not satisfy both conditions of the claim.\n\n#### For Row Index 9 (`llandrindod wells rfc`):\n- **Tries for**: 18\n- **Tries against**: 62\n- **Try Total**: \\(18 + 62 = 80\\)\n\nSince the try total is not 22, this team also does not satisfy both conditions of the claim.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nNo teams in the table have both 21 points and a try total of 22.
