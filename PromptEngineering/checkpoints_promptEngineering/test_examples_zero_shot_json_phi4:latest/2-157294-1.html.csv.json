The relevant column for this claim is \"goals for\" under the \"european cup\" competition.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps to verify the claim:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: We need to focus on the \"European Cup\" row in the table, specifically the \"goals for\" column, which shows how many goals were scored by Nottingham Forest in that competition.\n\n2. **Extract the Value**: From the \"European Cup\" row:\n   - The value under \"goals for\" is 32.\n\n3. **Determine Context**: The claim states that Nottingham Forest scored the most goals at the European Cup compared to other competitions listed. Therefore, we need to compare this number (32) with the \"goals for\" values from other competitions in the table:\n   - UEFA Cup: 18 goals\n   - Inter-Cities Fairs Cup: 8 goals\n   - UEFA Super Cup: 4 goals\n\n4. **Comparison**: \n   - The \"goals for\" value of 32 for the European Cup is greater than the values for all other competitions listed (18, 8, and 4).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since Nottingham Forest scored more goals in the European Cup than in any other competition listed, the claim that they \"scored the most goals at the European Cup\" is true within the context of this table.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant cells are those containing the \"goals for\" values under each competition row and specifically the \"European Cup\" row.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
