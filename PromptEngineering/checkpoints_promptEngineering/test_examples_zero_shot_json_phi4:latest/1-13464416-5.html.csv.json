    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"la lakers be the team play in game 6\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data from the table:\n\n1. **Identify Game 6:** \n   - The table lists games sequentially with a column labeled \"game\". We look for the row where `game = 6`.\n   - However, our dataset starts at game 16 and goes up to game 29. Therefore, there is no entry for game 6 in this data.\n\n2. **Check Game 20:**\n   - Since there is no game 6 listed, we need to verify if the claim might be referring to another game number.\n   - The claim specifies \"la lakers\", so we should look at each row's \"team\" column to find where \"la lakers\" appears. This is found in game 20.\n\n3. **Verify Details for Game 20:**\n   - In game 20, the team listed is indeed \"la lakers\".\n   - However, since the claim specifically refers to \"game 6\", and no such entry exists in our dataset, the claim cannot be true based on the data provided.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is false because there is no game 6 in the table, and thus it cannot refer to any team playing in that game according to this dataset.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are those corresponding to the \"game\" column (to confirm there is no game 6) and the \"team\" column for game 20 (where \"la lakers\" appears).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
