    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Brandi Love was nominated for and won 5 awards in 2013,\" we need to analyze the table data provided in the JSON format:\n\n### Breakdown of the Claim:\n1. **Person Involved**: The claim mentions \"Brandi Love.\" We must ensure that all entries relate to her.\n2. **Total Awards Mentioned**: The claim states she was involved with 5 awards.\n3. **Types of Involvement**:\n   - Nominated for at least some awards.\n   - Won at least one award.\n\n### Analysis of the Table Data:\n\n#### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Check Each Entry in the Data:**\n   - All entries are from the year 2013, which matches the claim's time frame.\n   \n2. **Count Total Awards (both nominated and won):**\n   - There are five rows in the data, indicating five awards mentioned.\n\n3. **Verify Types of Involvement:**\n   - Nominated for: \n     - \"milf / cougar performer of the year\" at AVN Award\n     - \"most outrageous sex scene (with kelly madison )\" at AVN Award\n     - \"best ass\" at Nightmoves Award\n     - \"web star of the year\" at XBIZ Award\n   - Won:\n     - \"best cougar / milf performer (editor\u2019s choice)\" at Nightmoves Award\n\n4. **Check for Brandi Love:**\n   - The table does not explicitly mention \"Brandi Love.\" It only lists award categories, results, and works without specifying the individuals.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- While the claim about winning 1 award and being nominated for 4 awards in 2013 is consistent with the data provided (5 total awards), there is no explicit connection to Brandi Love within this table. The table does not verify that these are Brandi Love's awards.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot confirm that these awards relate to \"Brandi Love.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze each component of the claim against the data provided in the table:\n\n1. **Entity**: The claim mentions \"Brandi Love\" as the individual associated with the award.\n2. **Award**: It specifies the \"web star of the year\" award.\n3. **Ceremony**: The ceremony is identified as the \"xbiz award.\"\n4. **Year**: The event took place in 2013.\n\nNow, let's verify these details using the relevant columns from the table:\n\n- **Row Indexing**:\n  - Each row corresponds to an entry where a performer was either nominated or won at a specific ceremony for a particular award.\n  \n- **Verification Process**:\n  - Check if there is any row in the data that matches all parts of the claim (specifically focusing on \"xbiz award,\" \"web star of the year,\" and \"won\").\n\nLet's go through the rows:\n\n1. Row 0: \n   - Ceremony: \"avn award\"\n   - Result: \"nominated\"\n   - Award: \"milf / cougar performer of the year\"\n   - This row is not relevant as it does not match any part of the claim.\n\n2. Row 1:\n   - Ceremony: \"avn award\"\n   - Result: \"nominated\"\n   - Award: \"most outrageous sex scene (with kelly madison)\"\n   - This row is not relevant for similar reasons as Row 0.\n\n3. Row 2:\n   - Ceremony: \"nightmoves award\"\n   - Result: \"won\"\n   - Award: \"best cougar / milf performer (editor\\u2122s choice)\"\n   - This row is not relevant to the claim about the xbiz award.\n\n4. Row 3:\n   - Ceremony: \"nightmoves award\"\n   - Result: \"nominated\"\n   - Award: \"best ass\"\n   - Again, this row does not relate to the xbiz award or web star of the year.\n\n5. Row 4:\n   - Ceremony: \"xbiz award\"\n   - Result: \"nominated\"\n   - Award: \"web star of the year\"\n   - This row matches the ceremony and the award from the claim but indicates a nomination, not a win.\n\nSince no row in the data shows that Brandi Love won the \"web star of the year\" at the xbiz award ceremony in 2013 (the closest match is a nomination), the claim is false.\n\n**JSON Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"ceremony\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"award\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
