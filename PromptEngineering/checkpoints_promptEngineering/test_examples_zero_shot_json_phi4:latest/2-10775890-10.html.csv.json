We need to ensure there is a match in the table with this date and verify if it corresponds to an attendance of 15,747.\n\n3. **Venue Check:** According to the claim, this highest attendance was at \"Brunswick Street Oval\" for a match between \"Fitzroy\" and \"North Melbourne\". We must confirm that these details align correctly on July 2 with the specified crowd number.\n\nLet's go through each relevant condition:\n\n- **Condition 1: Attendance Comparison**\n  - Match 0 (June 25, 1960): 17,934\n  - Match 1 (June 25, 1960): 26,979\n  - Match 2 (June 25, 1960): 22,300\n  - Match 3 (July 2, 1960): 15,747\n  - Match 4 (July 2, 1960): 25,700\n  - Match 5 (July 2, 1960): 28,000\n\nThe highest attendance is actually 28,000 on July 2 at Punt Road Oval between Richmond and Collingwood. Therefore, the claim that 15,747 was the highest attendance is false.\n\n- **Condition 2: Date Verification**\n  - Matches on July 2 are correctly listed in rows 3 to 5.\n\n- **Condition 3: Venue and Teams Check for Attendance 15,747**\n  - Row index 3 corresponds to:\n    - Home team: Fitzroy\n    - Away team: North Melbourne\n    - Venue: Brunswick Street Oval\n    - Crowd: 15,747\n    - Date: July 2\n\nThe attendance of 15,747 on July 2 at Brunswick Street Oval for the match between Fitzroy and North Melbourne is correctly listed in row index 3.\n\nSince the highest attendance was actually 28,000 (not 15,747), we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate the scores for all games listed in the table and find out which game has the lowest total score.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: The relevant columns for this task are \"home team score\" and \"away team score\". We will sum these scores for each row to determine the total score of each game.\n\n2. **Extract Scores**:\n   - For each row, extract both the home team score and away team score.\n   - Convert the score from the format \"X.Y (Z)\" where X is goals, Y is behinds, and Z is the total points (calculated as \\( \\text{goals} \\times 6 + \\text{behinds} \\)).\n\n3. **Calculate Total Scores**:\n   - Calculate the total score for each game by adding the home team score and away team score.\n   - Identify which game has the lowest total score.\n\n4. **Verification of Claim**: The claim states that the lowest score is for Fitzroy with a score of 20.10 (130). We need to verify if this is indeed the lowest total score.\n\n5. **Calculation**:\n   - Geelong vs Melbourne: 41 + 83 = 124\n   - Carlton vs Footscray: 80 + 50 = 130\n   - South Melbourne vs Hawthorn: 73 + 84 = 157\n   - Fitzroy vs North Melbourne: 130 + 108 = 238\n   - Essendon vs St Kilda: 76 + 74 = 150\n   - Richmond vs Collingwood: 84 + 97 = 181\n\n6. **Determine Lowest Score**:\n   - The lowest total score is 124 for the game between Geelong and Melbourne.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The claim that Fitzroy has the lowest score with 130 is false, as the lowest score is actually 124 by Geelong vs Melbourne.\n\n8. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - For verifying the scores of each team in every row, we need to look at both \"home team score\" and \"away team score\".\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
