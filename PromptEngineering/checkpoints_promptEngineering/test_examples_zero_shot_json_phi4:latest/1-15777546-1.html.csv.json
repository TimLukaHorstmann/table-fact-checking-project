    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"episode number 10 be entitle reflection,\" we need to verify two aspects from the provided table:\n\n1. **Episode Number**: Identify which episode is numbered as \"10\" in terms of its sequence within season 2.\n2. **Title Verification**: Confirm that this particular episode has the title \"reflection.\"\n\n### Analysis:\n- The relevant columns for this verification are \"no in season\" and \"title.\"\n- We need to locate the row where the value under \"no in season\" is `10`.\n- Once identified, we check if the corresponding value in the \"title\" column matches \"reflection.\"\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Locate Episode with Season Number 10**:\n   - From the table data, find the entry where `\"no in season\"` equals `10`.\n\n2. **Verify Title**:\n   - Check if the title for this episode is exactly \"reflection.\" Note that case sensitivity and spacing matter; thus, it should match exactly.\n\n### Verification:\n\n- In the data provided, the row with `\"no in season\": 10` corresponds to:\n  ```json\n  [\n    36,\n    10,\n    \"reflections\",\n    \"chuck patton\",\n    \"roland gonzalez\",\n    \"february 14 , 2004\",\n    \"s02e10\"\n  ]\n  ```\n- The title in this row is `\"reflections\"`.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim states the episode should be titled \"reflection,\" but it is actually titled \"reflections.\"\n- Therefore, the claim is **FALSE** due to a mismatch in the title.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant cells for verifying this claim are found at `row_index: 9` (since indexing starts from 0) with columns `\"no in season\"` and `\"title\"`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
