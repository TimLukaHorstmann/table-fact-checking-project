    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"lake central be the team that have most recently join the conference\" is true or false, we need to analyze the data in the table with respect to the relevant column: \"year joined\". This column indicates when each school joined their respective conference.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The claim pertains to which team joined most recently. Thus, the column \"year joined\" is crucial for verifying this information.\n\n2. **Extract Data from the Column**:\n   - Extract the \"year joined\" values for each row in the data section of the table.\n   - These are:\n     - Chesterton: 1970\n     - Crown Point: 1993\n     - Lake Central: 2003\n     - Laporte: 1976\n     - Merrillville: 1975\n     - Michigan City: 1995\n     - Portage: 1970\n     - Valparaiso: 1970\n\n3. **Determine the Most Recent Year**:\n   - Compare all the \"year joined\" values to find the most recent year.\n   - The years are: 1970, 1993, 2003, 1976, 1975, 1995, 1970, and 1970.\n   - The most recent year is 2003.\n\n4. **Identify the Team**:\n   - Check which team corresponds to the year 2003.\n   - From the data, Lake Central joined in 2003.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since Lake Central has the most recent \"year joined\" value of 2003 among all teams listed, the claim is supported by the table.\n\nThus, based on this analysis, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is \"TRUE\".\n\nThe relevant cells are those containing the \"year joined\" information for each team. The row index for Lake Central is 2 (since indices start at 0).\n\nHere's the JSON object with the solution:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},  // Lake Central\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to evaluate whether each school listed in the table was previously part of the Calumet conference before joining a new one.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The relevant column for this evaluation is \"previous conference\", as it tells us which conference each school belonged to before their current affiliation.\n2. **Check Each Row**: We need to check the value in the \"previous conference\" column against the claim's condition, specifically looking for any instance where the previous conference was \"calumet\".\n\n### Evaluation:\n- **Chesterton** (Row 0): \n  - Previous Conference: \"calumet\"\n  - Since it was part of the Calumet conference before joining, this contradicts the claim.\n\n- **Crown Point** (Row 1):\n  - Previous Conference: \"lake suburban\"\n  - Does not contradict the claim as it wasn't in the Calumet conference.\n\n- **Lake Central** (Row 2):\n  - Previous Conference: \"independents\"\n  - Does not contradict the claim as it wasn't in the Calumet conference.\n\n- **Laporte** (Row 3):\n  - Previous Conference: \"northern indiana\"\n  - Does not contradict the claim as it wasn't in the Calumet conference.\n\n- **Merrillville** (Row 4):\n  - Previous Conference: \"lake suburban\"\n  - Does not contradict the claim as it wasn't in the Calumet conference.\n\n- **Michigan City** (Row 5):\n  - Previous Conference: \"none (new school)\"\n  - Does not contradict the claim as it was a new school and didn\u2019t belong to any previous conference including Calumet.\n\n- **Portage** (Row 6): \n  - Previous Conference: \"calumet\"\n  - Since it was part of the Calumet conference before joining, this contradicts the claim.\n\n- **Valparaiso** (Row 7):\n  - Previous Conference: \"independents\"\n  - Does not contradict the claim as it wasn't in the Calumet conference.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim states that \"none of the school be previously part of the calumet conference before join\". However, both Chesterton and Portage were previously part of the Calumet conference. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON output with the necessary information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"previous conference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"previous conference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
