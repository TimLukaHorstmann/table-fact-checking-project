    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"ngalben be the we two for the you two ngipeniya\" is true or false based on the given table:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Parts of the Claim:**\n   - The phrase \"ngalben be the we two\" refers to the nominative-accusative-instrumental (nom-acc-inst) case for \"we two\".\n   - The phrase \"for the you two ngipeniya\" refers to the locative case for \"you two\".\n\n2. **Locate Data in the Table:**\n   - For \"ngalben be the we two\":\n     - Look at the row where the \"case / suffix\" is \"gen\", because \"ngalben\" appears in that column under \"we two\".\n     - Verify if the corresponding entry for \"we two\" in the \"nom-acc-inst\" case matches.\n   - For \"for the you two ngipeniya\":\n     - Look at the row where the \"case / suffix\" is \"loc\", because \"ngipeniya\" appears under that column for \"you two\".\n\n3. **Cross-Verify the Information:**\n   - In the row with \"gen\", check if \"ngalben\" is correctly listed under \"we two\".\n   - In the row with \"loc\", confirm that \"ngipeniya\" is indeed listed under \"you two\".\n\n4. **Check the Claim Against Table Data:**\n   - From the table:\n     - Under \"gen\", for \"we two\", the entry is \"ngalben\". This confirms that \"ngalben\" is correct as per the claim.\n     - Under \"loc\", for \"you two\", the entry is \"ngipeniya\". This also aligns with what's stated in the claim.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both parts of the claim are supported by the table data, making the entire statement true.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells to Verify Claim:**\n   - For \"ngalben be the we two\": \n     - Row 1 (nom-acc-inst) and column \"we two\" where it should show \"ngalbe\".\n     - Row 1 (gen) and column \"we two\" confirming \"ngalben\".\n   - For \"for the you two ngipeniya\":\n     - Row 4 (loc) and column \"you two\" showing \"ngipeniya\".\n\nThe claim is TRUE, supported by these relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"we two\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"we two\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"you two\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
