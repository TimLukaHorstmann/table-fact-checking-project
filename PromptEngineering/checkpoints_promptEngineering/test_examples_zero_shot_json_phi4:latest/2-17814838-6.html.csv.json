Compare the attendance figures for both matches.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Match (Tie):**\n   - Look for the entry with \"home team\" as \"derby county\" and \"away team\" as \"nottingham forest,\" or vice versa, with a score that indicates a tie.\n   - The initial match is found in row 15:\n     - Home Team: Derby County\n     - Score: 1 - 1 (indicating a tie)\n     - Away Team: Nottingham Forest\n     - Attendance: 32035\n\n2. **Identify Replay Match:**\n   - Look for the replay entry with \"home team\" as \"nottingham forest\" and \"away team\" as \"derby county,\" or vice versa.\n   - The replay match is found in row 16:\n     - Home Team: Nottingham Forest\n     - Score: 2 - 3\n     - Away Team: Derby County\n     - Attendance: 29001\n\n3. **Compare Attendances:**\n   - Initial Match Attendance (Row 15): 32035\n   - Replay Match Attendance (Row 16): 29001\n\nThe attendance for the initial match is higher than that of the replay.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the above analysis, the claim is false because the initial tie had a higher attendance compared to the replay.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
