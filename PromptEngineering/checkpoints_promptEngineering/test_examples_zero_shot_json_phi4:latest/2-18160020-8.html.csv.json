The claim states: \"miguel zapata have the fewest number of goal with 17.\"\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: \n   - We are interested in the column labeled \"goals\" because it directly relates to the number of goals scored by each goalkeeper.\n   - Additionally, we need to check the name \"miguel zapata\" in the \"goalkeeper\" column to ensure we're examining the correct row.\n\n2. **Extract and Compare Data**:\n   - We will extract all values from the \"goals\" column to compare them against 17 (the number of goals attributed to Miguel Zapata).\n   - Check if any goalkeeper has fewer than 17 goals.\n\n3. **Verification Steps**:\n   - Find Miguel Zapata in the table.\n     - He is located at row index 0: [\"miguel zapata\", 17, 28, 0.61, \"atl\u00e9tico ciudad\"]\n   - Extract all goal counts from the data:\n     - Row 0: 17 goals\n     - Row 1: 24 goals (Rub\u00e9n Mart\u00ednez)\n     - Row 2: 29 goals (Orlando Quintana)\n     - Row 3: 24 goals (\u00c1lvaro Campos)\n     - Row 4: 26 goals (Mat\u00edas Garavano)\n\n4. **Comparison**:\n   - Compare each value in the \"goals\" column to 17.\n   - Since all other goalkeepers have more than 17 goals, Miguel Zapata indeed has the fewest number of goals.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is supported by the data: Miguel Zapata does have the fewest number of goals with 17.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - We consider all cells in the \"goals\" column for comparison and the specific cell where Miguel Zapata's goals are listed.\n   - Relevant rows for verification:\n     - Row index 0, \"goals\": 17 (Miguel Zapata)\n     - Row index 1, \"goals\": 24\n     - Row index 2, \"goals\": 29\n     - Row index 3, \"goals\": 24\n     - Row index 4, \"goals\": 26\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is TRUE.
