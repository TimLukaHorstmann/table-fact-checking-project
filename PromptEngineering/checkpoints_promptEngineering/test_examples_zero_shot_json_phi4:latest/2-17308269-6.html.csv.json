    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the specific conditions mentioned in the claim and check them against the data provided in the table.\n\n### Breakdown of the Claim:\n1. **\"ann strother (g) player be from connecticut\"**\n   - We need to verify if Ann Strother's nationality is listed as \"Connecticut\". However, we should note that the column for nationality is actually listing countries, not states within the United States. Therefore, the correct check here would be whether her nationality is \"United States\".\n\n2. **\"be never play on indiana fever\"**\n   - We need to verify if Ann Strother's former WNBA team includes \"Indiana Fever\". If it does, then this part of the claim would be false.\n\n### Relevant Data from Table:\n- Locate Ann Strother in the table by finding the row where her name appears.\n- Check the values for \"nationality\" and \"former wnba team\".\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Find Ann Strother's Row:**\n   - From the data, Ann Strother is listed at `row_index` 4.\n\n2. **Check Nationality:**\n   - In row 4, under the column \"nationality\", the value is \"united states\".\n   - The claim incorrectly specifies Connecticut as a nationality, but since it's referring to her origin state, we interpret this as checking if she's from the U.S., which she is.\n\n3. **Check Former WNBA Team:**\n   - In row 4, under the column \"former wnba team\", the value is \"indiana fever\".\n   - The claim states she has never played for Indiana Fever, but the table shows she did play there.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The first part of the claim about her nationality being from Connecticut is incorrect in terms of interpretation, but since it refers to U.S., and she is indeed American, this can be seen as supported.\n- The second part of the claim is definitively false because Ann Strother played for Indiana Fever.\n\nGiven that one part of the claim is false (she did play for Indiana Fever), the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 4, Column \"nationality\"\n- Row 4, Column \"former wnba team\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"former wnba team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
