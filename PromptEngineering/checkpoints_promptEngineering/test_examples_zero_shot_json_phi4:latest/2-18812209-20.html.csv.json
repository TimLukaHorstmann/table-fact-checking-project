    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the \"points\" column of the provided table and check if the difference between the maximum and minimum points among all constructors is at most 11.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Extract Points for Each Constructor:**\n   - Citro\u00ebn Total World Rally Team: 456 points\n   - BP Ford World Rally Team: 337 points\n   - Citro\u00ebn Junior Team: 217 points\n   - Stobart M-Sport Ford Rally Team: 176 points\n   - Munchi's Ford World Rally Team: 58 points\n\n2. **Identify Maximum and Minimum Points:**\n   - Maximum Points = 456 (Citro\u00ebn Total World Rally Team)\n   - Minimum Points = 58 (Munchi's Ford World Rally Team)\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - Difference = Maximum Points - Minimum Points\n   - Difference = 456 - 58 = 398\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"between all of the constructor there be a difference of at most 11 point.\"\n   - Since the calculated difference (398) is greater than 11, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - All rows in the points column are relevant to verify this claim as we need to consider every constructor's points to determine the maximum and minimum values.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the difference in points between the constructors exceeds 11.
