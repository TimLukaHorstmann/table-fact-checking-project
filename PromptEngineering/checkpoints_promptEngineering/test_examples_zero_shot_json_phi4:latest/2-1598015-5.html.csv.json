We will analyze each row to verify the claim:\n\n1. **Masters Tournament (Row 0)**\n   - Wins: 0\n   - Top - 10: 3\n   - Top - 25: 4\n   - Since \"top - 25\" is not less than 4, this row does not need to be checked.\n\n2. **US Open (Row 1)**\n   - Wins: 0\n   - Top - 10: 1\n   - Top - 25: 3\n   - Both \"top - 10\" and \"top - 25\" are less than 4, and wins is 0.\n   - This supports the claim.\n\n3. **The Open Championship (Row 2)**\n   - Wins: 0\n   - Top - 10: 1\n   - Top - 25: 2\n   - Both \"top - 10\" and \"top - 25\" are less than 4, and wins is 0.\n   - This supports the claim.\n\n4. **PGA Championship (Row 3)**\n   - Wins: 0\n   - Top - 10: 1\n   - Top - 25: 4\n   - Since \"top - 25\" is not less than 4, this row does not need to be checked.\n\n5. **Totals (Row 4)**\n   - This row aggregates data and does not represent individual tournament conditions, so it is irrelevant for checking the claim.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe rows where both \"top - 10\" and \"top - 25\" are less than 4 all have \"wins\" equal to 0. Therefore, the claim holds true based on the provided data.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n- Row 1: \n  - Wins (column index 1)\n  - Top - 10 (column index 3)\n  - Top - 25 (column index 4)\n\n- Row 2:\n  - Wins (column index 1)\n  - Top - 10 (column index 3)\n  - Top - 25 (column index 4)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"top - 10\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"top - 25\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"top - 10\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"top - 25\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim against the table data provided in JSON format, we need to carefully examine each part of the statement and compare it with relevant data points.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **Event**: The claim pertains specifically to the \"pga championship.\"\n2. **Condition 1**: \"when top - 25 be less than 4\"\n3. **Condition 2**: \"have 0 win\"\n4. **Condition 3**: \"with cut made 6\"\n5. **Condition 4**: \"and top - 5 be greater than 0\"\n\n### Verification:\nLet's check each condition against the \"pga championship\" row.\n\n#### Row for \"pga championship\":\n- Wins: 0\n- Top - 5: 1\n- Top - 10: 1\n- Top - 25: 4\n- Events: 10\n- Cuts made: 8\n\n**Condition 1**: \"when top - 25 be less than 4\"\n- In the row for \"pga championship,\" the value for \"top - 25\" is 4, which is not less than 4. Therefore, this condition fails.\n\nSince Condition 1 itself is not met, the other conditions do not need to be verified for this specific claim (as they depend on the first condition being true). However, let's verify them for completeness:\n\n**Condition 2**: \"have 0 win\"\n- The value for \"wins\" in the \"pga championship\" row is indeed 0. This condition would be satisfied.\n\n**Condition 3**: \"with cut made 6\"\n- The value for \"cuts made\" in the \"pga championship\" row is 8, not 6. Therefore, this condition fails.\n\n**Condition 4**: \"and top - 5 be greater than 0\"\n- The value for \"top - 5\" in the \"pga championship\" row is 1, which is greater than 0. This condition would be satisfied.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim states conditions that are not fully met by the data for the \"pga championship.\" Specifically, Condition 1 (\"when top - 25 be less than 4\") and Condition 3 (\"with cut made 6\") do not hold true for this row.\n\nThus, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nTo verify the claim, we need to check these cells from the \"pga championship\" row:\n- Wins (row_index: 3, column_name: \"wins\")\n- Top - 25 (row_index: 3, column_name: \"top - 25\")\n- Cuts made (row_index: 3, column_name: \"cuts made\")\n- Top - 5 (row_index: 3, column_name: \"top - 5\")\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"top - 25\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"top - 5\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
