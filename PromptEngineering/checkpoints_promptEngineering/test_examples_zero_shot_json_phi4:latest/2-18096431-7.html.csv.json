    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"mark brook be the player who earn the most money\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table:\n\n1. **Identify Key Components of the Claim:**\n   - The claim is about a player named \"Mark Brook.\"\n   - It states that this player earned the most money.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Data from the Table:**\n   - We need to look at both the \"player\" and \"money\" columns.\n   - Verify if there's an entry for \"Mark Brook\" in the \"player\" column.\n   - Check the \"money\" amounts for all players listed, especially comparing Mark Brooks' earnings.\n\n3. **Analyze the Table:**\n   - The first row lists a player named \"mark brooks\" (note the lowercase 'b') with a money amount of 430,000.\n   - Other players have various money amounts:\n     - Kenny Perry: 260,000\n     - Steve Elkington and Tommy Tolles: 140,000 each\n     - Justin Leonard, Jesper Parnevik, Vijay Singh: 86,667 each\n     - Lee Janzen, Per-Ulrik Johansson, Phil Mickelson, Larry Mize, Frank Nobilo, Nick Price: 57,500 each\n\n4. **Verify the Claim Against the Table Data:**\n   - Since \"mark brook\" is not exactly listed (it's actually \"mark brooks\"), we should consider if this is a typographical error in the claim.\n   - Even accounting for potential typos, Mark Brooks earns 430,000, which is indeed more than any other player's earnings listed.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - If we interpret the claim as referring to \"Mark Brooks,\" then the statement that he earned the most money is TRUE based on the table data.\n   - The relevant cells for this verification are those listing Mark Brooks' name and his associated money column, along with a comparison of all other players' earnings.\n\n6. **Compile Relevant Cells:**\n   - Row index 0 for \"player\" (\"mark brooks\") and \"money\" (430000).\n   - All rows for the \"money\" column to compare earnings.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"money\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"money\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"money\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"money\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"money\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"money\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"money\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"money\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"money\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"money\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"money\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"money\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

However, the data shows that Nick Price is from Zimbabwe, not Frank Nobilo. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"kenny perry earn 170000 more than mark brook\" is true or false, we need to compare the earnings of Kenny Perry and Mark Brooks from the table.\n\n1. Identify relevant entries in the table:\n   - Mark Brooks' entry: Row index 0.\n     - Column 'money': $430,000\n   - Kenny Perry's entry: Row index 1.\n     - Column 'money': $260,000\n\n2. Calculate the difference in earnings between Kenny Perry and Mark Brooks:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = \\text{Kenny Perry's earnings} - \\text{Mark Brooks' earnings}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = 260,000 - 430,000 = -170,000\n   \\]\n\n3. Analyze the claim:\n   - The claim states that \"kenny perry earn 170000 more than mark brook\".\n   - Based on our calculation, Kenny Perry earns $170,000 less than Mark Brooks, not more.\n\n4. Conclusion:\n   - Since the calculated difference is negative, meaning Kenny Perry earns less than Mark Brooks, the claim is false.\n\n5. Relevant cells for verification:\n   - Row index 0, Column 'money' (Mark Brooks)\n   - Row index 1, Column 'money' (Kenny Perry)\n\nBased on this analysis, here's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"money\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
