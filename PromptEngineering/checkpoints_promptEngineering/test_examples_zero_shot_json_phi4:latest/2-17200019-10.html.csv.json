    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to compare Jonathan Legear's total goals with Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez's total goals and check their rankings in terms of goals scored in the Belgian First Division A league.\n\n1. **Jonathan Legear's Total Goals**: According to the table, Jonathan Legear has a \"total\" of 7 goals.\n   \n2. **Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez's Total Goals**: Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez also has a \"total\" of 3 goals.\n\n3. **Difference in Goals**: The claim states that Jonathan Legear scored 4 more goals than Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez. Calculating the difference:\n   \\[\n   7 - 3 = 4\n   \\]\n   This part of the claim is true.\n\n4. **Ranking Check**:\n   - We need to verify if Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez is the next highest rank player in the Belgian First Division A league after Jonathan Legear.\n   - Jonathan Legear scored 5 goals in the \"league\" column.\n   - We look for players with more than 1 league goal (since Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez has only 1 league goal) but fewer than or equal to 5 league goals:\n     - **Mbark Boussoufa**: 11 league goals\n     - **Tom de Sutter**: 9 league goals\n     - **Guillaume Gillet**: 8 league goals\n     - **Marcin Wasilewski**: 8 league goals\n     - **Nicol\u00e1s Frutos**: 6 league goals\n     - **Thomas Chatelle**: 4 league goals\n     - **Roland Juh\u00e1sz**: 4 league goals\n     - **Stanislav Vl\u010dek**: 4 league goals\n\n   Among these, Thomas Chatelle, Roland Juh\u00e1sz, and Stanislav Vl\u010dek each have 4 league goals.

Identify the row corresponding to Jelle Van Damme:\n   - From the table, Jelle van Damme has a league title count of 3 (5th entry).\n\n2. Determine what it means for him to have scored \"3 times as much\" as each of the other two players in the UEFA Champions League:\n   - This implies that each of the other two players should have won exactly \\( \\frac{3}{3} = 1 \\) league title.\n\n3. Identify rows where the league count is 1, excluding Jelle Van Damme himself:\n   - Oleksandr Iakovenko has a league count of 2 (17th entry).\n   - Hern\u00e1n Losada has a league count of 1 (18th entry).\n   - Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez also has a league count of 1 (13th entry), but this is irrelevant to the claim as it's about the UEFA Champions League, not considering Super Cup.\n\n4. Verify if there are exactly two players with 1 league title each:\n   - Hern\u00e1n Losada and Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez both have 1 league title.\n   - However, Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez also has a super cup title, which is not relevant for the UEFA Champions League count but confirms he does participate in similar competitions.\n\n5.
