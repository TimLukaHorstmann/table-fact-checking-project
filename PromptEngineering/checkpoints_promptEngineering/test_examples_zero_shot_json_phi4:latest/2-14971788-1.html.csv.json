We are particularly interested in the home team's (Colts) score.\n- `opponent`: To ensure we are considering games played by the Colts and not against them, although the structure suggests all listed games involve the Colts as they appear to be playing at or away.\n\nNow, let's analyze the data:\n\n1. **Game 1**: \"w 38 - 31\"\n   - Colt's score: 38\n2. **Game 3**: \"w 41 - 7\"\n   - Colt's score: 41\n3. **Game 4**: \"w 24 - 3\"\n   - Colt's score: 24\n5. **Game 5**: \"t 24 - 24\"\n   - Colt's score: 24\n6. **Game 7**: \"w 17 - 13\"\n   - Colt's score: 17\n7. **Game 8**: \"w 13 - 10\"\n   - Colt's score: 13\n9. **Game 9**: \"w 49 - 7\"\n   - Colt's score: 49\n10. **Game 10**: \"w 41 - 7\"\n    - Colt's score: 41\n11. **Game 12**: \"w 23 - 17\"\n    - Colt's score: 23\n13. **Game 13**: \"w 30 - 10\"\n    - Colt's score: 30\n\nThe highest point total scored by the Colts in any game is indeed 49, which occurs during Game 9 against the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nThus, based on this analysis, the claim is supported by the data provided.

There were no losses during this period.\n\n**Conclusion**: Since there are no recorded losses for the Colts in October 1967, the claim that they didn't lose any game in that month is supported by the data provided.\n\n**Relevant Cells**:\n- Row 3: Result column (\"w 41 - 7\")\n- Row 4: Result column (\"w 24 - 3\")\n- Row 5: Result column (\"t 24 - 24\")\n\nThe JSON object reflecting this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the colt be undefeated in all of their game this season\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table provided.\n\nThe claim implies that for every game played by the Colts in this season, they should have either won or tied (no losses). Thus, we must examine each row in the data and focus on the \"result\" column, which indicates whether the team won (\"w\"), lost (\"l\"), or tied (\"t\").\n\nLet's evaluate each game:\n\n1. Week 1: Result is \"w 38 - 31\" \u2013 Win\n2. Week 2: Result is \"w 38 - 6\" \u2013 Win\n3. Week 3: Result is \"w 41 - 7\" \u2013 Win\n4. Week 4: Result is \"w 24 - 3\" \u2013 Win\n5. Week 5: Result is \"t 24 - 24\" \u2013 Tie\n6. Week 6: Result is \"t 20 - 20\" \u2013 Tie\n7. Week 7: Result is \"w 17 - 13\" \u2013 Win\n8. Week 8: Result is \"w 13 - 10\" \u2013 Win\n9.

Week 13: Result is \"w 30 - 10\" \u2013 Win\n14. Week 14: Result is \"l 10 - 34\" \u2013 Loss\n\nThe Colts have a loss in week 14 (as indicated by the result \"l 10 - 34\").
