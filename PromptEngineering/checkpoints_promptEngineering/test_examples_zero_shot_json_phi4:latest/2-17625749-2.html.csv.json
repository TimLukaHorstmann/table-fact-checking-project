    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Canton RFC gain the fourth - least point through 20 game,\" we need to focus on the column labeled \"points\" and compare the values for each club.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: We are interested in the \"points\" column, as this will tell us how many points each team has accumulated.\n\n2. **Extract Points for Each Club**:\n   - Pontyclun RFC: 86\n   - Cilfynydd RFC: 74\n   - Barry RFC: 63\n   - St Albans RFC: 55\n   - Deri RFC: 52\n   - Hirwaun RFC: 51\n   - Penygraig RFC: 43\n   - Cowbridge RFC: 37\n   - Old Penarthians RFC: 33\n   - Dinas Powys RFC: 19\n   - Canton RFC: 10\n\n3. **Sort the Points in Ascending Order**:\n   - Canton RFC: 10\n   - Dinas Powys RFC: 19\n   - Old Penarthians RFC: 33\n   - Cowbridge RFC: 37\n   - Penygraig RFC: 43\n   - Hirwaun RFC: 51\n   - Deri RFC: 52\n   - St Albans RFC: 55\n   - Barry RFC: 63\n   - Cilfynydd RFC: 74\n   - Pontyclun RFC: 86\n\n4. **Determine the Fourth-Lowest Points**:\n   - The clubs with the lowest points are:\n     1. Canton RFC (10)\n     2. Dinas Powys RFC (19)\n     3. Old Penarthians RFC (33)\n     4. Cowbridge RFC (37)\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that \"Canton RFC gain the fourth-least point.\"\n   - According to our sorted list, Canton RFC has the least points, not the fourth-least.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is FALSE because Canton RFC does not have the fourth-least points; they have the least.\n\n7. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - We need to include the \"points\" column for all clubs to verify the sorting and ranking of points.\n   - This includes rows 1 through 12 (0-indexed) in the \"points\" column.\n\nThe JSON response is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
