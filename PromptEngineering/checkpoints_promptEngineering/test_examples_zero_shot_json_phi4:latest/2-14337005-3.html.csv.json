    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about a game against the Toronto Blue Jays ending with a score of 2 - 1 is true or false, we need to examine the relevant entries in the table for games against the Toronto Blue Jays and their respective scores.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: The column \"opponent\" contains information about which team played in each game, and the column \"score\" shows the result of each game. We need to look at these columns for entries where the opponent is \"toronto blue jays\".\n\n2. **Extract Entries for Toronto Blue Jays**:\n   - May 5: Score is \"3 - 1\"\n   - May 6: Score is \"2 - 1\"\n   - May 13: Score is \"4 - 0\"\n   - May 14: Score is \"7 - 2\"\n\n3. **Verify the Claim**: The claim states that a game ended with a score of \"2 - 1\". From our extracted data, there is indeed an entry (May 6) where the score was \"2 - 1\".\n\n4. **Determine Answer and Relevant Cells**:\n   - Since we found an entry matching the claimed score, the answer is \"TRUE\".\n   - The relevant cells are those containing the opponent name \"toronto blue jays\" and the score \"2 - 1\". Specifically, these are at row index 3 (May 6) in the columns \"opponent\" and \"score\".\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis confirms that the claim is true based on the data provided in the table.",
