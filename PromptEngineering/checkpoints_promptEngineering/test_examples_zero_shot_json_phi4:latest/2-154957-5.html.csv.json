    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify each part of it against the data provided in the table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **Player Name**: \"ben frank\"\n2. **Caps**: 30 caps\n3. **Club/Province**: \"hawke 's bay / hurricane\"\n\nLet's evaluate these claims one by one:\n\n#### 1. Player Name: \"ben frank\"\n- We need to find a row with the player name exactly matching \"ben frank\".\n- The table has an entry for \"ben franks\" (note the extra 's').\n\n#### 2. Caps: 30 caps\n- For the player \"ben franks\", we see that he has 30 caps listed in the data.\n\n#### 3. Club/Province: \"hawke 's bay / hurricane\"\n- The table shows \"ben franks\" is associated with \"hawke's bay / hurricanes\".\n- There's a minor discrepancy: \"hurricane\" in singular form as per claim, whereas it's plural (\"hurricanes\") in the data.\n  \n### Conclusion:\nThe player name does not match exactly due to an extra 's' in the table. Also, there is a slight difference in club/province description (singular vs. plural). These discrepancies mean that the entire claim cannot be considered fully true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"FALSE\".\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The row for \"ben franks\" contains relevant information:\n  - Player name: \"ben franks\"\n  - Caps: 30\n  - Club/Province: \"hawke 's bay / hurricanes\"\n\nHere is the JSON representation of the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"ben franks\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"30\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"hawke 's bay / hurricanes\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
