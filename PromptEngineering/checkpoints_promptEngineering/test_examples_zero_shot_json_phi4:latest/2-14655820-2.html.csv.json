    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the Green Bay Packers' loss with the largest point spread against the San Diego Chargers on November 24, 1974, we need to examine relevant data in the table.\n\n1. **Identify the game against the San Diego Chargers:**\n   - The claim mentions a game against the San Diego Chargers on November 24, 1974.\n   - From the \"data\" array, find the row with \"opponent\" as \"san diego chargers\" and \"date\" as \"november 24 , 1974\".\n   - This corresponds to row index 10.\n\n2. **Verify the result of this game:**\n   - Check the \"result\" column for row index 10, which shows \"w 34 - 0\". \n   - The Packers won this game with a point spread of 34 points (Packers' score minus Chargers' score).\n\n3. **Determine if it was their largest loss in terms of point spread:**\n   - To validate the claim about the largest losing margin, we need to check all games where the Packers lost and compare the point spreads.\n   - Identify rows with \"result\" indicating a loss (\"l\"):\n\n     - Row index 0: Lost to Minnesota Vikings (32-17), point spread = 15\n     - Row index 3: Lost to Buffalo Bills (27-7), point spread = 20\n     - Row index 6: Lost to Detroit Lions (19-17), point spread = 2\n     - Row index 8: Lost to Washington Redskins (17-6), point spread = 11\n     - Row index 12: Lost to Philadelphia Eagles (36-14), point spread = 22\n     - Row index 13: Lost to San Francisco 49ers (7-6), point spread = 1\n     - Row index 14: Lost to Atlanta Falcons (10-3), point spread = 7\n\n4. **Compare the losing spreads:**\n   - The largest loss in terms of point spread is against the Philadelphia Eagles with a margin of 22 points.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that the Packers lost with the largest point spread to the San Diego Chargers on November 24, which is incorrect because they actually won that game.\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells for this verification include:\n- Row index 10 (San Diego Chargers game)\n- All rows where \"result\" indicates a loss for comparison\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
