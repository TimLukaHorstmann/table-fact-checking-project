    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two parts of it against the provided table:\n\n1. **Date Verification**: The claim specifies \"on august 13th, 1966\". We need to ensure that there is a row in the data where the date matches this value.\n\n2. **Team and Venue Verification**: The claim states that on this date, the away team was \"north melbourne\" and the home team was \"collingwood\". We must find a matching row with these team details.\n\nLet's break down the verification process:\n\n- First, check each row for the date \"13 august 1966\".\n- For rows with the correct date, verify if the home team is \"collingwood\" and the away team is \"north melbourne\".\n\nNow, let's go through the data:\n\n1. **Row 0**:\n   - Date: \"13 august 1966\" (matches)\n   - Home Team: \"st kilda\" (does not match \"collingwood\")\n   - Away Team: \"south melbourne\" (does not match \"north melbourne\")\n\n2. **Row 1**:\n   - Date: \"13 august 1966\" (matches)\n   - Home Team: \"essendon\" (does not match \"collingwood\")\n   - Away Team: \"fitzroy\" (does not match \"north melbourne\")\n\n3. **Row 2**:\n   - Date: \"13 august 1966\" (matches)\n   - Home Team: \"collingwood\" (matches \"collingwood\")\n   - Away Team: \"north melbourne\" (matches \"north melbourne\")\n\n4. **Row 3**:\n   - Date: \"13 august 1966\" (matches)\n   - Home Team: \"carlton\" (does not match \"collingwood\")\n   - Away Team: \"melbourne\" (does not match \"north melbourne\")\n\n5. **Row 4**:\n   - Date: \"13 august 1966\" (matches)\n   - Home Team: \"richmond\" (does not match \"collingwood\")\n   - Away Team: \"geelong\" (does not match \"north melbourne\")\n\n6. **Row 5**:\n   - Date: \"13 august 1966\" (matches)\n   - Home Team: \"hawthorn\" (does not match \"collingwood\")\n   - Away Team: \"footscray\" (does not match \"north melbourne\")\n\nFrom this analysis, Row 2 satisfies all conditions of the claim. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n- Date in Row 2\n- Home Team in Row 2\n- Away Team in Row 2\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
