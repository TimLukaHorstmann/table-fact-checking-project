The result of such a match is \"draw\".\n\nHere are the steps to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Total Points \u2265 3:**\n   - We calculate the sum of scores for each row:\n     - Row 0: 1 + 0 = 1\n     - Row 1: 3 + 0 = 3\n     - Row 2: 1 + 1 = 2\n     - Row 3: 0 + 1 = 1\n     - Row 4: 0 + 3 = 3\n     - Row 5: 1 + 0 = 1\n     - Row 6: 13 + 0 = 13\n     - Row 7: 2 + 0 = 2\n     - Row 8: 3 + 0 = 3\n     - Row 9: 2 + 0 = 2\n     - Row 10: 1 + 1 = 2\n     - Row 11: 2 + 2 = 4\n     - Row 12: 0 + 0 = 0\n     - Row 13: 0 + 1 = 1\n     - Row 14: 1 + 0 = 1\n     - Row 15: 0 + 6 = 6\n     - Row 16: 3 + 0 = 3\n\n2. **Check for \"Draw\" Result in Rows with Total Points \u2265 3:**\n   - From the above calculations, rows with total points \u2265 3 are:\n     - Row 1 (Total Points = 3)\n     - Row 4 (Total Points = 3)\n     - Row 11 (Total Points = 4)\n     - Row 15 (Total Points = 6)\n     - Row 16 (Total Points = 3)\n\n   - Check the \"result\" column for these rows:\n     - Row 1: Result is \"win\"\n     - Row 4: Result is \"loss\"\n     - Row 11: Result is \"draw\"\n     - Row 15: Result is \"loss\"\n     - Row 16: Result is \"win\"\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only row where the total points are \u2265 3 and the result is a draw is Row 11.\n   - Therefore, the claim that the most number of points scored in a match being 3 with it being a draw is FALSE because there are matches with more than 3 points scored (e.g., rows 11 and 15) where the total score was higher.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - For Row 11, the relevant columns are \"score\" and \"result\".\n   - For Row 15, the relevant columns are \"score\" and \"result\".\n\nThe final JSON output is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
