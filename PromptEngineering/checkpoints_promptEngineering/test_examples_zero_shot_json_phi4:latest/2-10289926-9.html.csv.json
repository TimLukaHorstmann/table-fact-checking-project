    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to evaluate it based on the provided table data and conditions mentioned in the claim.\n\n**Claim Breakdown:**\n- The claim states two swimmers, Luke Hall and Jonathan Calderon, have:\n  - A rank of exactly 100.\n  - A time of exactly 25.00.\n\n**Data from Table:**\n\n1. **Luke Hall (Row 4):**\n   - Overall Rank: 105\n   - Time: 27.47\n\n2. **Jonathan Calderon (Row 2):**\n   - Overall Rank: 101\n   - Time: 27.16\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- The claim specifies that both swimmers have an overall rank of 100, which is not reflected in the data:\n  - Luke Hall's actual overall rank is 105.\n  - Jonathan Calderon's actual overall rank is 101.\n\n- Additionally, both are claimed to have a time of exactly 25.00 seconds:\n  - Luke Hall's recorded time is 27.47 seconds.\n  - Jonathan Calderon's recorded time is 27.16 seconds.\n\nNeither the ranks nor times from the claim match those in the table data. \n\nThus, based on the provided information, the conditions necessary to verify the claim are not met by any row of data.
