    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two parts of the claim:\n\n1. The series number should be 39.\n2. \"Michael Lembeck\" should be listed as the writer for this episode.\n\nLet's analyze the table data provided in JSON format:\n\n### Step-by-step Verification\n\n#### Relevant Columns:\n- **series**: This column contains the series numbers, which we need to match with the claimed series number (39).\n- **written by :**: This column lists the writers of each episode. We need to check if \"Michael Lembeck\" is mentioned here.\n\n#### Checking Each Episode:\n\n1. **Find Series Number 39:**\n   - The table's `data` array has rows where each row corresponds to an episode.\n   - We iterate through these rows to find one with the series number of 39.\n\n2. **Verify Writer for Series Number 39:**\n   - Once we locate the row corresponding to series number 39, check the \"written by :\" column.\n   - Ensure that \"Michael Lembeck\" is listed as a writer in this field.\n\n#### Relevant Data Extraction:\n- From the `data` array, locate the entry where the first element (series) is 39. This corresponds to the row index of 12 in zero-based indexing.\n  \nFor series number 39:\n- **Row Index**: 12\n- **Series**: 39\n- **Written by**: \"Leslie Rieder\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that Michael Lembeck wrote the episode with series number 39. However, according to the table, Leslie Rieder is credited as the writer for this episode.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n#### Relevant Cells:\nWe have identified the relevant cells from the JSON data structure for verification:\n\n- **Row Index**: 12\n- **Columns**: \"series\", \"written by :\"\n\nThe final JSON object reflecting our findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"written by :\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
