Verify if only two films have the same title in English and Croatian.\n2. Identify those two films as \"libertas\" and \"armin\".\n\nLet's go through the data step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Check for Films with Identical Titles\n\nWe'll examine each entry in the dataset to see which ones have identical titles in both the \"film title used in nomination\" (English) and \"original title\" (Croatian).\n\n- **Row 15**: \n  - English Title: \"libertas\"\n  - Croatian Title: \"libertas\"\n  - These titles are identical.\n\n- **Row 16**:\n  - English Title: \"armin\"\n  - Croatian Title: \"armin\"\n  - These titles are identical.\n\nNo other rows have the same film title in both languages. Thus, there are only two films with matching titles.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Film Names\n\nWe need to confirm that the two films identified indeed match the names given in the claim:\n\n- The first film with identical titles is \"libertas\".\n- The second film with identical titles is \"armin\".\n\nBoth of these correspond exactly to those specified in the claim (\"libertas\" and \"armin\").\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis confirms both conditions of the claim:\n1. Only two films have identical English and Croatian titles.\n2. Those films are indeed named \"libertas\" and \"armin\".\n\nTherefore, the claim is **TRUE**.\n\nRelevant cells that support this conclusion are those corresponding to rows 15 and 16 for both columns \"film title used in nomination\" and \"original title.\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"original title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"original title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We need to check if any entries list more than one name, separated by an \"&\", which indicates co-directors.\n\n2. **Check each row**:\n   - For each entry in the table under the \"director(s)\" column, look for the presence of an \"&\". This symbol indicates that there are multiple directors for a film.\n   \n3. **Find any entries with co-directors**:\n   - Look through each row to see if the director name includes \"&\":\n     - Row 19 (2010, \"The Blacks\"): \"goran devi\\u0107 & zvonimir juri\\u0107\" shows two directors, indicating co-direction.\n\n4. **Determine the claim's validity**:\n   - Since there is at least one instance of a Croatian film with co-directors in the table (\"The Blacks\"), this contradicts the claim that no such films were entered into the Academy Awards.\n   \n5. **Conclusion**: The presence of co-directors in row 19 makes the claim false.\n\nThus, the final output should reflect that the claim is not supported by the data provided:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"director (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this JSON object:\n- `\"answer\": \"FALSE\"` indicates that the claim is incorrect.\n- The `relevant_cells` list contains one entry with `{\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"director (s)\"}` because it shows the row where co-directors are listed.
