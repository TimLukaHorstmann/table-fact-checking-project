    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the only district to list Mac Sweeney as incumbent is Texas 14\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify two parts of this statement using the provided table:\n\n1. Check if Mac Sweeney is listed as the incumbent for Texas 14.\n2. Ensure that Mac Sweeney is not listed as the incumbent for any other district.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n**Step 1: Verify Mac Sweeney's Incumbency in Texas 14**\n\n- Look at the row where \"district\" is \"texas 14.\"\n- Check if the \"incumbent\" column matches \"mac sweeney.\"\n\nFrom the table:\n- Row with `row_index` 13 has \"district\": \"texas 14\", and \"incumbent\": \"mac sweeney\". This confirms that Mac Sweeney is listed as the incumbent for Texas 14.\n\n**Step 2: Ensure No Other District Lists Mac Sweeney as Incumbent**\n\n- Examine all rows to confirm no other district lists \"mac sweeney\" in the \"incumbent\" column.\n\nScanning through all rows:\n- None of the other districts (rows with `row_index` 0 to 12 and 14 to 19) list Mac Sweeney as the incumbent. Each row contains a different individual's name under the \"incumbent\" column for those districts.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied: Mac Sweeney is listed as the incumbent only for Texas 14, with no other district having him listed as such in the table.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"district\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"incumbent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
