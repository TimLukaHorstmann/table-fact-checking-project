Identify if there is a budget of 1000 mentioned for the US special episode.\n2. Verify that this budget (1000) is indeed the smallest among all episodes listed.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n#### Check 1: Identify Budget for \"US Special\"\n- Locate the row corresponding to \"February 2007\" and check the \"budget\" column:\n  - Row Index 1 contains data for \"series 9, episode 3\", titled \"us special.\"\n  - The budget in this row is indeed `1000`.\n\n#### Check 2: Verify if Budget of 1000 is Smallest\n- Examine all rows under the \"budget\" column to find the smallest non-\"n/a\" value:\n  - Row Index 1 (February 2007): Budget = 1000.\n  - Row Index 3 (November 2007): Budget = 1500.\n  - Row Index 4 (December 2008): Budget = 15000000\u20b9.\n  - Row Index 5 (December 2009): Budget = 3500.\n  - Row Index 6 (December 2010): Budget = \"3500 may spent 3966\" \u2013 The smallest explicit number here is 3500, but it's not a straightforward numeric value like the others.\n  - Row Index 7 (December 2011): Budget = 7000.\n  - Row Index 8 (March 2013): Budget = 1500.\n\n- From this examination, the budget of `1000` in February 2007 is indeed the smallest given amount listed.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth conditions from the claim are satisfied: a) The US special show in February 2007 has a budget of 1000, and b) This value is the smallest among all specified budgets.
