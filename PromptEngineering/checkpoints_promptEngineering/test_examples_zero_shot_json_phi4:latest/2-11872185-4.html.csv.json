    "resp": "To verify the claim \"no lifetime india distributor share be give earlier than 2009,\" we need to focus on two columns from the table: \"year\" and \"lifetime india distributor share.\" The task is to determine if there are any entries in the table with a year earlier than 2009 that have a non-zero \"lifetime india distributor share.\"\n\n1. **Year Column**: This column indicates the release year of each movie.\n2. **Lifetime India Distributor Share Column**: This represents the earnings distribution from the movies.\n\nTo assess the claim, we need to check all rows for any entry with a \"year\" earlier than 2009 and confirm that their \"lifetime india distributor share\" is non-zero (i.e., they received some amount).\n\nLet's evaluate each row:\n\n- **Row 1**: Year = 2013\n- **Row 2**: Year = 2012\n- **Row 3**: Year = 2009\n- **Row 4**: Year = 2013\n- **Row 5**: Year = 2012\n- **Row 6**: Year = 2011\n- **Row 7**: Year = 2010\n- **Row 8**: Year = 2012\n- **Row 9**: Year = 2012\n- **Row 10**: Year = 2011\n\nThe earliest year listed is 2009 (in Row 3). There are no rows with a year earlier than 2009. Thus, there cannot be any lifetime distributor shares given for years before 2009.\n\nSince all relevant years in the table start from 2009 onwards, and none precede it, the claim is fully supported by the data provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is \"TRUE.\" Since no rows meet the condition of having a year earlier than 2009 with a distributor share, there are no specific cells that need listing other than ensuring all checked years were appropriately evaluated. However, for completeness, we can list the relevant columns (\"year\" and \"lifetime india distributor share\") from Row 3 as it is the earliest year considered:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"lifetime india distributor share\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"lifetime india share earlier than 2009 be 0\" is true or false, we need to examine each row in the table and focus on two key pieces of information for each movie: the year it was released and its lifetime India distributor share.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information**: \n   - The relevant columns are \"year\" and \"lifetime india distributor share\".\n   \n2. **Filter by Year**:\n   - We need to check if there is any movie with a release year earlier than 2009.\n   \n3. **Check Distributor Share**:\n   - For those movies, we must ensure that the lifetime India distributor share is 0.\n\n### Analysis of the Data:\n\nLet's examine each row in the \"data\" array:\n\n- Row 1: \n  - Year: 2013\n  - Lifetime India Distributor Share: \"114 , 25 , 00000\"\n  - **Not relevant** since it's not earlier than 2009.\n\n- Row 2:\n  - Year: 2012\n  - Lifetime India Distributor Share: \"106 , 00 , 00000\"\n  - **Not relevant** since it's not earlier than 2009.\n\n- Row 3:\n  - Year: 2009\n  - Lifetime India Distributor Share: \"99 , 02 , 00000\"\n  - **Not relevant** since it's not earlier than 2009.\n\n- Rows 4 to 10 follow the same pattern as rows 1 to 3, with years all being either 2010 or later. Therefore, none of these movies were released before 2009.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince there are no movies in the table that have a release year earlier than 2009, there is no need to check their lifetime India distributor share for non-zero values. The claim holds true by default because there are no counterexamples.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"TRUE\", and no relevant cells need to be listed as all movies are from 2009 or later.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
