    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the table and check the specific condition stated in the claim: finding if there's a rank where \"goals per match\" is greater than 1.237.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that the rank 11 should have a \"goals per match\" value more than 1.237. This implies we need to find if there exists any row with `rank` equal to 11 and its corresponding `\"goals per match\"` greater than 1.237.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - We are interested in rows where the `rank` is 11.\n   - For those rows, check the `\"goals per match\"` value to see if it exceeds 1.237.\n\n3. **Examine Table Rows for Rank 11**:\n   - From the data provided, identify any row with `rank = 11`.\n   - The table shows one such entry:\n     ```json\n     [\n       11,\n       \"alfredo di st\\u00e9fano\",\n       \"1956 / 57\",\n       \"real madrid\",\n       43,\n       43,\n       1.0\n     ]\n     ```\n   - In this row, the `\"goals per match\"` is 1.0.\n\n4. **Comparison**:\n   - Compare the identified `\"goals per match\"` value (1.0) with 1.237.\n   - Since 1.0 is not greater than 1.237, the condition specified in the claim does not hold true for rank 11.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - There are no rows with `rank = 11` that have a `\"goals per match\"` value exceeding 1.237.\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cell to check is where `rank = 11`, specifically the `\"goals per match\"` column in that row.\n\n7. **JSON Output**:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"goals per match\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object indicates that the claim is false and specifies the relevant cell checked to determine this conclusion.",
