We need to locate this date within the table's data.\n   - By scanning through each row under the \"date\" column, we find that the date \"august 15 , 2012\" is present in row index 6.\n\n2. **Check Score:**\n   - The claim specifies a score of \"3 - 0\". We need to verify this against the \"score\" column for the identified row (index 6).\n   - In row 6, the \"score\" is indeed listed as \"3 - 0\".\n\n3. **Check Result:**\n   - The claim states that the result was a \"win\".
