    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"yarraville oval be the only venue not put to use on 20 june 1942,\" we need to examine the data in the provided table and verify if Yarra Valley Oval was indeed the only venue used on that date.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column:**\n   - The claim concerns the \"venue\" column since it mentions specific venues, including Yarraville Oval.\n\n2. **Check the date condition:**\n   - All entries in the data have the same date, \"20 june 1942,\" which matches the date specified in the claim.\n\n3. **Examine each row for venue usage on 20 June 1942:**\n   - Row 0:\n     - Venue: Punt Road Oval\n     - Date: 20 June 1942 (Relevant because it confirms another venue was used)\n   - Row 1:\n     - Venue: Brunswick Street Oval\n     - Date: 20 June 1942 (Relevant for the same reason)\n   - Row 2:\n     - Venue: Arden Street Oval\n     - Date: 20 June 1942 (Relevant for the same reason)\n   - Row 3:\n     - Venue: Toorak Park\n     - Date: 20 June 1942 (Relevant for the same reason)\n   - Row 4:\n     - Venue: Yarraville Oval\n     - Date: 20 June 1942 (Confirms that Yarraville Oval was used)\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that \"yarraville oval be the only venue not put to use on 20 june 1942.\" However, our analysis shows that Yarraville Oval **was** used on that date. Additionally, multiple other venues were also used on the same date. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nTo verify this conclusion, we need data from all rows for both the \"venue\" and \"date\" columns because each entry confirms the use of a venue on the specified date.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
