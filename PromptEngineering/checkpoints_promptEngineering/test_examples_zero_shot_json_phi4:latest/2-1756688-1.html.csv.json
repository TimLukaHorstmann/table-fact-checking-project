There is no entry for 2008, which suggests he might have played for Geelong during that year as well, since there's no indication of a switch. Therefore, the data supports him playing with Geelong for at least three years (2005-2007) and possibly four if we assume 2008 was also with Geelong.\n\n- **Switch to Gold Coast:**\n  - 2011: \"gold coast\" is listed in the \"team\" column.\n\nThis confirms that Nathan Ablett switched to playing for the Gold Coast by 2011.\n\nThe claim states he played for Geelong for four years before switching to Gold Coast. The table supports him playing for at least three years and possibly four (if 2008 is included), then switching to Gold Coast in 2011.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is supported by the data, assuming 2008 was also with Geelong.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Row indices corresponding to \"geelong\" entries: 0, 1, 2.\n- Row index for the missing year (assuming it's still Geelong): 3.\n- Row index for \"gold coast\": 4.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the data for Nathan Ablett's performance with Geelong across the years provided and specifically check if 2008 was his best year in terms of points.\n\n1. **Understanding Points Calculation:**\n   - In Australian rules football, a \"point\" is awarded for each behind.\n   - A goal is worth 6 points plus any behinds kicked as part of that goal.\n   - Therefore, total points can be calculated as: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Points} = (\\text{Goals} \\times 6) + \\text{Behinds}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Analyzing Relevant Data for Geelong Years:**\n   - We need to consider the years Nathan Ablett played with Geelong, which are 2005, 2006, and 2007 according to the table.\n   - For each year, we will calculate the total points using the formula above.\n\n3. **Yearly Calculations for Geelong:**\n\n   - **2005:**\n     - Goals = 2\n     - Behinds = 8\n     - Total Points = (2 * 6) + 8 = 12 + 8 = 20\n\n   - **2006:**\n     - Goals = 3\n     - Behinds = 4\n     - Total Points = (3 * 6) + 4 = 18 + 4 = 22\n\n   - **2007:**\n     - Goals = 18\n     - Behinds = 34\n     - Total Points = (18 * 6) + 34 = 108 + 34 = 142\n\n4. **Year 2008 Analysis:**\n   - The table shows \"-\" for all statistics in 2008, indicating no data is available or he did not play that year.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Nathan Ablett's best year for points with Geelong was 2007 with 142 points.\n   - Since there is no data for 2008, it cannot be considered his best year.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim \"across all his years with Geelong, Nathan Ablett's best year for points was 2008\" is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this include the goals and behinds columns for each year he played with Geelong (2005, 2006, 2007) and the indication of no data for 2008.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
