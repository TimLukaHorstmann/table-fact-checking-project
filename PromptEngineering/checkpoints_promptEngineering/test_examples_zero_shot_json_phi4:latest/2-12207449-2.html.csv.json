    "resp": "To evaluate the claim that \"the blue jay in April 1986's shortest streak be a 0 - 1 game losing streak,\" we need to analyze the provided table data focusing on two main aspects: consecutive game outcomes and their corresponding records.\n\nThe claim specifies a \"shortest streak\" of a particular outcome, which implies examining sequences of consecutive games with the same win-loss record change. Specifically, it mentions a sequence resulting in a 0 - 1 loss (meaning one loss with no wins), so we will look for such patterns in the data.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:**\n   - The \"record\" column is crucial because it shows the win-loss progression after each game.\n   - We should also note the dates and outcomes to ensure they form a sequence of consecutive games.\n\n2. **Examine Consecutive Records for 0-1 Losing Streaks:**\n\n    Let's go through the data step-by-step:\n\n    - From April 8 to April 9:\n      - Record changes from \"0 - 1\" to \"1 - 1\"\n      - Not a losing streak.\n\n    - From April 9 to April 10:\n      - Record changes from \"1 - 1\" to \"2 - 1\"\n      - Not a losing streak.\n\n    - From April 11 to April 12:\n      - Record changes from \"3 - 1\" to \"3 - 2\"\n      - This is a single game with the result of \"0 - 1.\"\n\n    - From April 12 to April 13:\n      - Record changes from \"3 - 2\" to \"3 - 3\"\n      - Two consecutive losses, forming a streak of \"0 - 2\".\n\n    - From April 20 to April 21:\n      - Record changes from \"5 - 7\" to \"6 - 7\"\n      - Not a losing streak.\n\n    - From April 22 to April 23:\n      - Record changes from \"6 - 8\" to \"6 - 9\"\n      - Two consecutive losses, forming a streak of \"0 - 2\".\n\n3. **Identify Shortest Streak:**\n\n   The shortest losing streak mentioned in the claim is \"0 - 1.\" From our analysis:\n   \n   - April 11 (record \"3 - 1\" to \"3 - 2\") is a single game with a loss, meeting the criteria of a 0-1 losing streak.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n\n   The data shows that there are instances where the team had a 0 - 1 losing streak (specifically on April 12). However, it also includes longer losing streaks such as \"0 - 2.\" \n\n   Therefore, the claim is supported by the existence of at least one 0-1 losing streak.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\nThe relevant cells are those that directly contribute to identifying a 0 - 1 game losing streak:\n\n- April 11 (row index 3) and record \"3 - 1\"\n- April 12 (row index 4) and record \"3 - 2\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
