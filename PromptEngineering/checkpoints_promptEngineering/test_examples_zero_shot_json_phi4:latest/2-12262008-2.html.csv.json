The corresponding stage winners are:\n     - Stage 8: Mario Manzoni\n     - Stage 9: Dimitri Konyshev\n     - Stage 10: Mario Cipollini\n     - Stage 11: Gabriele Missaglia\n     - Stage 12: Giuseppe Di Grande\n     - Stage 13: Glenn Magnusson\n     - Stage 14: Ivan Gotti (though listed under \"Team Polti\")\n     - Stage 15: Alessandro Baronti\n\n   From this, we can see that neither Pavel Tonkov nor Mirco Gualdi are winners when the team is \"asics - cga\".\n\n2. **Having a mountain classification of Mariano Piccoli**:\n   - We need to check where \"Mariano Piccoli\" is mentioned in the \"mountains classification\" column.\n   - Stages 8 through 20 (inclusive) list \"Mariano Piccoli\" as the mountain classification winner.\n\n   From this, we find that the stages during which Mariano Piccoli holds the mountains classification are:\n     - Stage 8: Mario Manzoni\n     - Stage 9: Dimitri Konyshev\n     - Stage 10: Mario Cipollini\n     - Stage 11: Gabriele Missaglia\n     - Stage 12: Giuseppe Di Grande\n     - Stage 13: Glenn Magnusson\n     - Stage 14: Ivan Gotti (under \"Team Polti\")\n     - Stage 15: Alessandro Baronti\n     - Stage 16: Serhij Hon\u010dar\n     - Stage 17: Jos\u00e9 Luis Rubiera\n     - Stage 18: Jos\u00e9 Jaime Gonz\u00e1lez\n     - Stage 19: Pavel Tonkov\n     - Stage 20: Mario Cipollini\n\n   Among these, only in stage 19 does Pavel Tonkov hold the mountains classification of Mariano Piccoli.\n\nCombining both conditions:\n- For Pavel Tonkov to satisfy both parts of the claim, he would need to be a winner when \"asics - cga\" is listed as the team and also have Mariano Piccoli's mountain classification. This doesn't occur for any stage.\n- Similarly, for Mirco Gualdi to satisfy both conditions, he would need to win while \"asics - cga\" is listed and also have Mariano Piccoli's mountain classification. This does not happen either.\n\nTherefore, the claim that both Pavel Tonkov and Mirco Gualdi are winners from team \"asics - cga\" with a mountains classification of Mariano Piccoli is false.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"trofeo fast team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"trofeo fast team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"winner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"the winner of stage 1 which wasn't awarded a mountain classification be marcel w\u00fcst,\" we need to analyze the relevant parts of the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the conditions in the claim:\n\n1. Identify the winner of Stage 1.\n2. Verify if there was no mountain classification award for that stage.\n3. Check if Marcel W\u00fcst is stated as a condition or conclusion related to this scenario.\n\nNow let's examine these steps with respect to the data provided in the table:\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n1. **Identify the Winner of Stage 1:**\n   - From the table, for stage \"1\", the winner is listed under the \"winner\" column as \"mario cipollini\".\n   - Relevant cell for this check: `{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winner\"}`\n\n2. **Verify Mountain Classification Award Status for Stage 1:**\n   - For stage \"1\", the mountain classification is noted as \"not awarded\".\n   - This confirms that there was no winner of a mountain classification for this stage.\n   - Relevant cell for this check: `{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"}`\n\n3. **Check if Marcel W\u00fcst is Related to Stage 1 Conditions:**\n   - The claim suggests that the condition (no mountain classification and being a winner of Stage 1) should lead us to conclude or relate it somehow to Marcel W\u00fcst.\n   - However, from our data examination:\n     - \"marcel w\u00fcst\" is not listed as the winner of any stage except for stage \"7\".\n   - Since we are only concerned with stage \"1\", and since no condition in the claim relates Marcel W\u00fcst to this stage or situation, it can be confirmed that he has no relevance to the conditions specified.\n   - Relevant cell for checking Marcel W\u00fcst's involvement: `{\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"winner\"}` (where row index corresponds to Stage 7 winner).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim states that if a stage wasn't awarded a mountain classification and had a specific winner, then it should be related to or equate to Marcel W\u00fcst. However, the winner of Stage 1 was Mario Cipollini, not Marcel W\u00fcst. Therefore, this condition does not support the statement made in the claim.\n\nThus, the answer is \"FALSE\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"winner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
