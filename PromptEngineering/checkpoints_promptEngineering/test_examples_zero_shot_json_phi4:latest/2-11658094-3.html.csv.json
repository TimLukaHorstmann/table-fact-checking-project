    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, we need to check each condition specified in it against the data provided in the table:\n\n1. **Founded in 1891**: The claim mentions an institution founded in this year.\n2. **Left in 1975**: This refers to the year the institution left its conference or affiliation.\n3. **Location is Hickory, North Carolina**: This specifies where the institution is located.\n\nLet's go through the table and check these conditions:\n\n- We first look for institutions with a founding year of 1891:\n  - In the data provided, \"LenoirRhyne University\" is founded in 1891 (3rd index in data).\n\n- Next, we check if this institution left its conference or affiliation in 1975:\n  - For LenoirRhyne University, it joined a conference in 1930 and left in 1975.\n\n- Finally, we verify the location of this institution to see if it is Hickory, North Carolina:\n  - The location listed for LenoirRhyne University is indeed Hickory, North Carolina.\n\nAll conditions specified in the claim are satisfied by \"LenoirRhyne University\". Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table that support this conclusion are:\n\n- The cell with row index 8 (for LenoirRhyne University), column \"founded\" for the founding year.\n- The cell with row index 8, column \"joined\" and \"left\" to confirm the years it was part of its conference.\n- The cell with row index 8, column \"location\" to verify the institution's location.\n\nHere is the JSON object reflecting this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"left\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding a former private member university based on the provided table data, let's break down each condition in the claim and cross-reference it with the relevant entries from the table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **\"Former private member\":** We need to identify institutions that were once \"private.\"\n2. **\"Founded in 1839\":** The institution must have a founding year of 1839.\n3. **\"Left in 1975\":** The institution must have left its former conference or association in the year 1975.\n4. **\"Be Hickory, North Carolina\":** Finally, the location should be \"Hickory, North Carolina.\"\n\n### Cross-referencing with Table:\n- **Column Identification:**\n  - **Type:** Indicates whether the university is private or public.\n  - **Founded:** Provides the founding year of the institution.\n  - **Left:** Gives the year the institution left a conference.\n  - **Location (partially in \"institution\" column):** We'll derive this from the full location data.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n1. **Check for Private Universities Founded in 1839:**\n   - Only one entry has \"Founded\": 1839.\n     - Longwood University, located at Farmville, Virginia (Row Index: 10).\n\n2. **Confirm Type as Private:**\n   - The type for Longwood University is \"public,\" not \"private.\" Thus, it does not satisfy the private condition.\n\n3. **Check for Universities that Left in 1975:**\n   - Lenoir-Rhyne University (Row Index: 8) and Elon University (Row Index: 6) have \"Left\" year as 1975.\n   - Both were indeed private universities at some point, but they do not match the founding condition of 1839.\n\n4. **Location Verification for Hickory, North Carolina:**\n   - Lenoir-Rhyne University is located in Hickory, North Carolina (Row Index: 8).\n\n### Conclusion:\nNo institution meets all the specified criteria simultaneously\u2014being a private university founded in 1839, leaving in 1975, and being located in Hickory, North Carolina.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.
