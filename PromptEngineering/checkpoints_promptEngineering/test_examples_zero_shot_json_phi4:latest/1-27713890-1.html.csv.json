For `\"no in season\" = 11`, we identify:\n  - The corresponding `row_index` is 11 (since indexing starts at 0).\n  - Within this row, the title is \"the one with all the resolutions,\" matching the claim.\n  - The original air date listed is \"January 7, 1999,\" which also matches the claim.\n\nAll these conditions validate that the claim is accurate. Therefore, the answer to whether the claim is true is \"TRUE\".\n\nNow let's list out the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- `\"no in season\"` should be 11.\n- `\"title\"` should be \"the one with all the resolutions.\"\n- `\"original air date\"` should be \"January 7, 1999.\"\n\nThese correspond to row index 11 and columns \"no in season,\" \"title,\" and \"original air date.\"\n\nHere's the final JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
