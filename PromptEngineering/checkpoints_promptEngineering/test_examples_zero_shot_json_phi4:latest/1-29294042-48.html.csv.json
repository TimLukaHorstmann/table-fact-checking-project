    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the heaviest competitor weigh 80 kilogram\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to analyze the weight categories of each athlete in the competition.\n\nThe relevant part of the claim pertains to the athletes' weights as specified by their respective events. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding Weight Categories:**\n   - The event names in the table indicate weight categories for each athlete. For instance, \"finweight ( - 54 kg)\" indicates that Nariman Shakirov competes in the final weight category of up to 54 kilograms.\n\n2. **Extracting Weights from Events:**\n   - **Nariman Shakirov**: Competes in \"finweight (- 54 kg)\", meaning his weight class is up to 54 kg.\n   - **Zhalgas Bekkassymov**: Competes in \"flyweight (- 58 kg)\", indicating a weight class of up to 58 kg.\n   - **Darkhan Kassymkulov**: Competes in \"bantamweight (- 63 kg)\", meaning his weight category is up to 63 kg.\n   - **Aibar Dyussebayev**: Competes in \"lightweight (- 74 kg)\", indicating a class of up to 74 kg.\n   - **Sultan Kassymov**: Competes in \"welterweight (- 80 kg)\", meaning his weight category is up to 80 kg.\n\n3. **Determining the Heaviest Weight Category:**\n   - Based on the categories extracted:\n     - Nariman Shakirov's maximum weight is 54 kg.\n     - Zhalgas Bekkassymov's maximum weight is 58 kg.\n     - Darkhan Kassymkulov's maximum weight is 63 kg.\n     - Aibar Dyussebayev's maximum weight is 74 kg.\n     - Sultan Kassymov's maximum weight is 80 kg.\n\n4. **Evaluating the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the heaviest competitor weighs 80 kilograms. Since Sultan Kassymov competes in a category where competitors can weigh up to 80 kg, and no other competitor has a higher maximum weight class listed, this claim is supported by the data.\n\n5. **Identifying Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells for verification are those containing the event information that provides the weight categories:\n     - Row index 0 (Nariman Shakirov) in \"event\": finweight (- 54 kg)\n     - Row index 1 (Zhalgas Bekkassymov) in \"event\": flyweight (- 58 kg)\n     - Row index 2 (Darkhan Kassymkulov) in \"event\": bantamweight (- 63 kg)\n     - Row index 3 (Aibar Dyussebayev) in \"event\": lightweight (- 74 kg)\n     - Row index 4 (Sultan Kassymov) in \"event\": welterweight (- 80 kg)\n\nBased on the analysis, the claim is true.
