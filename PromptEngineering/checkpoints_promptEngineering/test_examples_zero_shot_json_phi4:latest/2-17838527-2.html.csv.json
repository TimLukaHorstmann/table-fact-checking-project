    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table, we need to verify two conditions:\n\n1. The rank 1 entry has a total of more than 21 medals.\n2. The total gold medal count for rank 1 is 13.\n\nLet's examine the relevant cells in the JSON table to check these conditions:\n\n- **Condition 1**: \"Rank 1 with a total of more than 21 medals\"\n  - Locate the row corresponding to rank 1, which is at index 0.\n  - Check the value in the \"total\" column for this row. \n  - The data shows that the total number of medals for rank 1 is 22.\n\n- **Condition 2**: \"Total gold medal be 13\"\n  - Again, locate the row corresponding to rank 1 (index 0).\n  - Check the value in the \"gold\" column for this row.\n  - The data shows that the total number of gold medals for rank 1 is indeed 13.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied:\n\n- Rank 1 has more than 21 total medals (22, which is greater than 21).\n- Rank 1 has a total of 13 gold medals.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- \"total\" column at row index 0.\n- \"gold\" column at row index 0.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if rank 3 has a total of 6 medals according to the given table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We are interested in the row where \"rank\" is equal to 3.\n   - For rank 3, the relevant data from the table is:\n     \\[\n     [\\text{3}, 1, 3, 12, 16]\n     \\]\n\n2. **Check Total Medals:**\n   - In the identified row for rank 3, we need to check the \"total\" column.\n   - The value in the \"total\" column for rank 3 is 16.\n\n3. **Evaluate Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"rank 3 have 6 total medal.\"\n   - From our verification, rank 3 actually has a total of 16 medals.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the actual total (16) does not match the claimed total (6), the claim is FALSE.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n     - Row index 2 (since JSON data starts at index 0, rank 3 corresponds to row index 2).\n     - Column name \"rank\" for checking the rank value.\n     - Column name \"total\" for verifying the total medal count.\n\nHere is the final JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
