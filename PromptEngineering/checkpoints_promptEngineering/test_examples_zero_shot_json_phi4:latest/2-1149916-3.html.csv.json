    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Denny Hulme be the driver at Anderstorp in 1973\" is true or false, we need to verify two key pieces of information from the provided table:\n\n1. **Year**: The claim specifies the year as 1973.\n2. **Driver**: The claim states that Denny Hulme was the driver for this year and location.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions the **location** as Anderstorp, which should also match the data in the relevant row.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Identify the Row for 1973**:\n   - Look through the \"year\" column to find the entry with \"1973\".\n\n2. **Verify Driver Information**:\n   - Check if the \"driver\" column for that row lists \"Denny Hulme\".\n\n3. **Verify Location Information**:\n   - Ensure that the \"location\" column matches \"Anderstorp\" for completeness, though it's not explicitly required by the claim.\n\n### Verification Process:\n\n- **Row Index**: The table entry for 1973 is at `row_index: 6`.\n  \n- **Year Column**: The year in this row is indeed \"1973\", matching the claim.\n\n- **Driver Column**: This column shows \"Denny Hulme\" which aligns with the claim.\n\n- **Location Column**: The location listed is \"Anderstorp\", confirming that Denny Hulme was at Anderstorp in 1973, fulfilling all conditions of the claim.\n\nGiven these checks, the claim is supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the answer is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n- The \"year\" column for row 6.\n- The \"driver\" column for row 6.\n- The \"location\" column for row 6.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
