    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two parts of it:\n\n1. **Total Attendance Over 58701**: \n   - We will sum up all the attendance figures from each game and check if this total exceeds 58701.\n\n2. **Week 8's Attendance Topping the Chart**:\n   - We must identify whether week 8 had the highest single-game attendance compared to other weeks.\n\nLet's analyze these parts using the relevant data:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Total Attendance\nThe attendance figures for each game (from \"attendance\" column) are as follows:\n\n- Week 1: 63713\n- Week 2: 44851\n- Week 3: 60955\n- Week 4: 57491\n- Week 6: 54254\n- Week 7: 74827\n- Week 8: 58701\n- Week 9: 58074\n- Week 10: 57348\n- Week 11: 56726\n- Week 12: 63597\n- Week 13: 73711\n- Week 14: 62193\n- Week 15: 57285\n- Week 16: 59898\n- Week 17: 61742\n\nNow, calculate the total:\n\n\\[ \n63713 + 44851 + 60955 + 57491 + 54254 + 74827 + 58701 + 58074 + 57348 + 56726 + 63597 + 73711 + 62193 + 57285 + 59898 + 61742 = 925225 \n\\]\n\nThe total attendance is indeed over 58701.\n\n### Step 2: Check Week 8 Attendance\nWe need to verify if the attendance for week 8 (58701) was the highest:\n\n- Compare 58701 with other weeks:\n  - The maximum attendance figure from other weeks is 74827 (Week 7).\n\nSince 74827 (Week 7) is greater than 58701 (Week 8), Week 8 does not have the top attendance.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim states \"with a total attendance of over 58701, week 8 tops the chart,\" which implies two conditions: \n- The total attendance exceeds 58701 (True).\n- Week 8 has the highest single-game attendance (False).\n\nThus, the entire claim is FALSE because although the total attendance condition is true, the second part is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- All \"attendance\" column entries for calculating the total.\n- The \"attendance\" entry specifically for week 8 and any other weeks with higher attendance.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
