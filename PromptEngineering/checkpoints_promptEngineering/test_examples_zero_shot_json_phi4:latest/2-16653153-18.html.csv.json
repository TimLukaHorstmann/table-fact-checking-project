Adelaide 36ers vs Wollongong Hawks at Distinctive Homes Dome\n2. Cairns Taipans vs Townsville Crocodiles at Cairns Convention Centre\n3. Gold Coast Blaze vs New Zealand Breakers at Gold Coast Convention Centre\n4. Perth Wildcats vs Melbourne Tigers at Marrara Stadium\n5. Sydney Spirit vs South Dragons at State Sports Centre\n\nNow, let's check the relevant game:\n\n- The row with \"Perth Wildcats\" as the home team and \"Melbourne Tigers\" as the away team on November 29:\n  - **Row Index**: 6 (0-based index)\n  - **Home Team**: Perth Wildcats\n  - **Away Team**: Melbourne Tigers\n\nThis matches the claim that the Melbourne Tigers were the away team playing against the Perth Wildcats on November 29.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.
