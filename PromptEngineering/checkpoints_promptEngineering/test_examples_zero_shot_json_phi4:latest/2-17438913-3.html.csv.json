    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate each component of the claim against the provided table data.\n\n### Breakdown of the Claim:\n\n1. **\"sco have the lowest amount of transfer at 22\":**\n   - This statement implies that players from Scotland (\"nat\" column with value \"sco\") are involved in a total of 22 transfers.\n   - We must count how many players listed under type \"transfer\" have their nationality as \"sco\".\n   - Additionally, we need to verify if this number (22) is indeed the lowest compared to other nationalities.\n\n### Steps for Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Scottish Transfers:**\n   - Go through each row in the data and check:\n     - If the \"nat\" column has the value \"sco\".\n     - If the \"type\" column has the value \"transfer\".\n\n2. **Count Scottish Transfers:**\n   - Count all such occurrences to determine if there are indeed 22 transfers.\n\n3. **Compare with Other Nationalities:**\n   - Similarly, count the number of transfers for other nationalities.\n   - Verify if 22 is the lowest among these counts.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n- **Relevant Rows and Columns:**\n  - We need to focus on the \"nat\", \"type\", and possibly \"transfer fee\" columns to determine transfer activity.\n  - Specifically, we are interested in rows where:\n    - \"nat\" is \"sco\".\n    - \"type\" is \"transfer\".\n\n- **Counting Scottish Transfers:**\n  - From the data provided:\n    - Filip \u0160ebo (row 7) - Transfer\n    - Carlos Cu\u00e9llar (row 9) - Transfer\n    - Daniel Cousin (row 16) - Transfer\n    - Chris Burke (row 21) - Transfer\n\n  - Total Scottish transfers = 4.\n\n- **Comparing with Other Nationalities:**\n  - Count the transfer type for other nationalities:\n    - Ivory Coast, Belgium, Slovakia, Spain, France, RSA, Gabon.\n    - Only Filip \u0160ebo, Jean-Claude Darcheville (row 22), and Chris Burke have transfers in winter.\n\n- **Verification of Lowest Transfers:**\n  - Since Scotland has only 4 transfers, it is indeed the lowest compared to other nationalities which have at least one transfer each.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states \"sco have the lowest amount of transfer at 22\", but we found that Scotland has only 4 transfers. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"nat\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"nat\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"nat\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"nat\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
