    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim regarding the match on 3 March 2010, we need to verify specific details in the provided table against the claim. The claim states:\n\n1. The date is \"3 March 2010\".\n2. The venue is \"Damascus, Syria\".\n3. The result is a win (\"w\").\n\nLet's analyze each condition by finding the relevant row and columns from the data.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n#### 1. Date Verification\n- **Claim**: \"3 March 2010\"\n- **Relevant Column**: \"date\"\n\nWe search through the rows for one with the date matching \"3 March 2010\". By examining the table, we find:\n- Row index: 2 (the third row in zero-indexed format)\n- Date cell value: \"3 March 2010\"\n\nThis matches the claim's specified date.\n\n#### 2. Venue Verification\n- **Claim**: \"Damascus, Syria\"\n- **Relevant Column**: \"venue\"\n\nFor the same row where we found the matching date:\n- Venue cell value: \"damascus , syria\" (note the space after the comma)\n\nThe venue matches the claim's specified location.\n\n#### 3. Result Verification\n- **Claim**: \"w\" (win)\n- **Relevant Column**: \"result\"\n\nAgain, in the same row:\n- Result cell value: \"w\"\n\nThis result aligns with the claim's specified outcome of a win.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table for the specified row. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
