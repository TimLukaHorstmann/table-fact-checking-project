    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify if Joseba Etxeberria played in exactly 4 friendly matches between 1997 and 2004 according to the provided table.\n\n### Steps for Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - The \"competition\" column indicates the type of match (friendly or otherwise).\n\n2. **Filter Data Based on Conditions:**\n   - We are interested in rows where:\n     - The \"competition\" is marked as \"friendly\".\n     - The \"date\" falls between 1997 and 2004.\n\n3. **Count the Relevant Matches:**\n   - Go through each row and count how many match entries satisfy both conditions mentioned above.\n\n### Analysis of Data:\n\nLet's examine the table to find relevant rows:\n\n- Row 0:\n  - Date: 19 November 1997\n  - Competition: friendly\n\n- Row 1:\n  - Date: 25 March 1998\n  - Competition: friendly\n  \n- Row 6:\n  - Date: 18 February 2004\n  - Competition: friendly\n\nThese are the rows where the \"competition\" is marked as \"friendly\". Now, let's count them:\n\n- Row 0: Friendly match in November 1997\n- Row 1: Friendly match in March 1998\n- Row 6: Friendly match in February 2004\n\nThe total number of friendly matches within the given timeframe (1997 to 2004) is **3**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that Joseba Etxeberria played in 4 friendly matches between 1997 and 2004. However, we found only 3 such matches in the data provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is \"FALSE\".\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells are those from rows where the match was marked as \"friendly\":\n\n- Row 0: {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n- Row 1: {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n- Row 6: {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Specifically, we need to check if there were any wins recorded by his team in these matches.\n\nFirstly, identify which entries in the table are relevant:\n- We are interested in matches that took place in the year 2000 and are part of the \"2002 world cup qualification\" competition.\n- From the data provided, there is only one entry for a match held on \"2 September 2000\":\n  - Venue: Ko\u0161evo, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n  - Score: 1 - 2 (indicating that Jos\u00e9ba Etxeberria's team lost this match)\n  - Result: 1 - 2 (confirming a loss for the same reason as above)\n  - Competition: \"2002 world cup qualification\"\n\nNow, evaluate whether there is any evidence of a win:\n- The only relevant entry from 2000 shows that Jos\u00e9ba Etxeberria's team lost with a score of 1 - 2.\n- Since this is the only match listed for the specified year and competition, and it was a loss, there are no wins to be found.\n\nConclusion:\n- The claim states that in 2000, Jos\u00e9ba Etxeberria did not win any matches in the 2002 World Cup qualification. This is true because there were no recorded wins; only a single match listed for this period resulted in a loss.\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting our conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

However, there is an entry with:\n     - Date: \"18 February 2004\"\n     - Venue: \"llu\u00eds companys, barcelona, spain\"\n\n   This shows that \"llu\u00eds compa\u00f1ys\" was a venue but for the year 2004, not in 2000.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The claim regarding \"amsterdam arena, amsterdam, netherlands\" being a venue in 2000 is supported.\n- However, there is no entry for \"llu\u00eds company, barcelona, spain\" as a venue in the year 2000. Instead, it appears in 2004.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim need to be true and one of them (the second venue) does not hold for the year 2000, the overall claim is false.\n\nRelevant data rows from the table are:\n- For \"amsterdam arena,\" row index 7.\n- For \"llu\u00eds compa\u00f1ys,\" even though it doesn't support the claim, the closest relevant entry is in row index 11 due to the venue name similarity.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
