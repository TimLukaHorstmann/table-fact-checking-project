    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two key aspects from the table:\n\n1. Identify if Corey Peters is listed as a defensive tackle.\n2. Check if Corey Peters was picked with pick number 19.\n\nLet's examine each condition using the relevant cells in the table:\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n1. **Locate Corey Peters:**\n   - Search for an entry where \"name\" equals \"corey peters\".\n   - In row index 1, we find:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"name\": \"corey peters\",\n       \"position\": \"defensive tackle\"\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Verify Position:**\n   - Confirm that Corey Peters is listed as a defensive tackle.\n   - The position for Corey Peters in row index 1 is indeed \"defensive tackle\".\n\n3. **Check Pick Number:**\n   - Verify if the pick number for Corey Peters is 19.\n   - In row index 1, the \"pick\" value is 19.\n\n4. **Ensure Uniqueness:**\n   - Ensure there are no other defensive tackles with a different pick number.\n   - Review all rows to confirm there are no other entries where the position is \"defensive tackle\".\n   - No other rows have the position as \"defensive tackle\".\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- Corey Peters is the only player listed as a defensive tackle, and he has a pick number of 19.\n\nTherefore, the claim is **TRUE**. The relevant cells to verify this are:\n\n- Row index 1 for the columns \"name\", \"position\", and \"pick\".\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
