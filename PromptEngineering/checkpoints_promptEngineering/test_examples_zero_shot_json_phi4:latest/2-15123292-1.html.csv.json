    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the Washington Redskins having a winning record during the 1953 season is true or false, we need to analyze the given table data.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We focus on the \"result\" column of each row to assess the outcomes of games.\n   - The team being discussed in the context of the claim is inferred as the Washington Redskins, even though it isn't explicitly mentioned.\n\n2. **Understanding Winning Record:**\n   - A winning record means more wins than losses over a season.\n   - We need to count the number of wins (W) and losses (L) from the \"result\" column for all games listed in 1953.\n\n3. **Analyze Each Game Result:**\n   - Week 1: Result is \"w 24 - 13\" \u2192 Win\n   - Week 2: Result is \"t 21 - 21\" \u2192 Tie (not counted as win or loss)\n   - Week 3: Result is \"w 13 - 9\" \u2192 Win\n   - Week 4: Result is \"l 30 - 14\" \u2192 Loss\n   - Week 5: Result is \"l 27 - 17\" \u2192 Loss\n   - Week 6: Result is \"l 27 - 3\" \u2192 Loss\n   - Week 7: Result is \"w 28 - 17\" \u2192 Win\n   - Week 8: Result is \"l 27 - 24\" \u2192 Loss\n   - Week 9: Result is \"w 24 - 21\" \u2192 Win\n   - Week 10: Result is \"w 17 - 9\" \u2192 Win\n   - Week 11: Result is \"w 10 - 0\" \u2192 Win\n   - Week 12: Result is \"l 14 - 13\" \u2192 Loss\n\n4. **Count Wins and Losses:**\n   - Total Wins (W): 6 (weeks 1, 3, 7, 9, 10, 11)\n   - Total Losses (L): 5 (weeks 4, 5, 6, 8, 12)\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The team has more wins (6) than losses (5).\n   - Therefore, the claim that \"the Washington Redskins have a winning record during the 1953 season\" is TRUE.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - We need to list all rows where the result affects the win/loss count.\n   - The relevant cells are in the \"result\" column for rows with indices: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
