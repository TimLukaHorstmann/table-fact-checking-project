Our task is to determine if Ammanford RFC indeed has the third highest number of drawn games.\n\nHere are the relevant steps:\n\n1. **Identify Drawn Games for Each Team:**\n   We extract the values under the \"drawn\" column for each team listed in the data rows:\n   - Corus (Port Talbot) RFC: 1\n   - Narberth RFC: 0\n   - Carmarthen Athletic RFC: 0\n   - Llangennech RFC: 0\n   - Whitland RFC: 1\n   - Bridgend Athletic RFC: 1\n   - UWIC RFC: 1\n   - Llanharan RFC: 1\n   - Tondu RFC: 0\n   - Waunarlwydd RFC: 1\n   - Bonymaen RFC: 0\n   - Ammanford RFC: 2\n\n2. **Sort Teams by Number of Drawn Games:**\n   We sort the teams based on their \"drawn\" values in descending order:\n   - Ammanford RFC: 2\n   - Corus (Port Talbot) RFC: 1\n   - Whitland RFC: 1\n   - Bridgend Athletic RFC: 1\n   - Narberth RFC: 0\n   - Carmarthen Athletic RFC: 0\n   - Llangennech RFC: 0\n   - Tondu RFC: 0\n   - Bonymaen RFC: 0\n   - UWIC RFC: 1\n   - Llanharan RFC: 1\n   - Waunarlwydd RFC: 1\n\n3. **Determine the Third Highest Number of Drawn Games:**\n   The sorted list shows that Ammanford RFC has 2 drawn games, which is the highest in the list.
