    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify two key parts of the claim against the table:\n\n1. **St Kilda's Home Team Score:**\n   - The claim states that St Kilda has a home team score of \"9.11 (65)\".\n   - We will look for St Kilda in the \"home team\" column and check their corresponding \"home team score\".\n\n2. **Collingwood's Home Team Score:**\n   - The claim states that Collingwood has a home team score of \"11.13 (79)\".\n   - We will look for Collingwood in the \"home team\" column and check their corresponding \"home team score\".\n\nLet's verify these against the table data:\n\n### Verification\n\n- **St Kilda:**\n  - St Kilda is found in row index 5 of the data:\n    - Home Team: \"st kilda\"\n    - Home Team Score: \"14.17 (101)\"\n  - The claim states their score should be \"9.11 (65)\", but it's actually \"14.17 (101)\".\n\n- **Collingwood:**\n  - Collingwood is found in row index 3 of the data:\n    - Home Team: \"collingwood\"\n    - Home Team Score: \"13.23 (101)\"\n  - The claim states their score should be \"11.13 (79)\", but it's actually \"13.23 (101)\".\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth parts of the claim are incorrect based on the data provided in the table.
