This is a win.\n   - **June 21**: Against the Tigers, the record is \"38 - 34\". This is a win.\n   - **June 22**: Against the Tigers, the record is \"39 - 34\".

The score is not directly provided but since Escobar has an updated loss record, this indicates a loss for the Blue Jays.\n  \n- **June 17**: Opponent is \"red sox\", Loss recorded as \"mart\u00ednez (5 - 4)\".
