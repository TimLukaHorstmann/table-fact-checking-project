The latitude for this township should be \"-97.945530\".\n\nLet's break down how we can verify these using the table provided in JSON format.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Row with Township Name \"janke\"**\n- We need to find which row corresponds to the township named \"janke\". By inspecting each entry under the \"township\" column, we identify that \"janke\" is in the fourth row (index 3).\n\n**Step 2: Check the Latitude for Township \"janke\"**\n- Once we have identified the correct row index, we need to look at the latitude value for this row. The latitude should be checked against the claim \"-97.945530\".\n\nNow let's extract and verify these details:\n\n1. **Row Identification**:\n   - From the data, the township \"janke\" is found in the fourth entry (index 3).\n\n2. **Latitude Verification**:\n   - For this row (index 3), the latitude listed is \"46.415512\".\n   - The claim states that the latitude should be \"-97.945530\".\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe latitude for the township \"janke\" in the table is indeed not \"-97.945530\", but rather \"46.415512\". Therefore, the claim does not match the data.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n- **Row Index**: 3 (since the township \"janke\" is in this row)\n- **Column Name for Township**: \"township\"\n- **Column Name for Latitude**: \"latitude\"\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"township\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"latitude\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON response indicates that the claim is false and highlights the relevant cells used to verify it.",
