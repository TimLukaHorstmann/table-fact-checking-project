Identify the event \"brighton hotel bombing\".\n2. Verify that its location is \"brighton, uk\".\n\nLet's examine the relevant data:\n\n- The table lists events with their corresponding locations.\n- We need to find the row where the event matches \"brighton hotel bombing\".\n- Once found, we will check if the location for this event is \"brighton, uk\".\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Event:**\n   - Look through each entry in the data section of the table until we find an entry with the event name \"brighton hotel bombing\".\n   - This occurs at row index 14.\n\n2. **Verify Location:**\n   - Check the location for this entry.\n   - The location listed is indeed \"brighton, uk\".\n\nSince both conditions are met (the event name matches and the location is correct), the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\nHere's the relevant information:\n\n- Row index 14 corresponds to the event \"brighton hotel bombing\".\n- Column names for verification:\n  - \"event\": \"brighton hotel bombing\"\n  - \"location\": \"brighton, uk\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is true. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Identify the row corresponding to the \"Brighton Hotel Bombing.\"\n2. Check the location associated with this event.\n\nLet's analyze step by step:\n\n- **Identify the Event**: \n  - We search for the row that lists the event as \"brighton hotel bombing.\" From the table, we find it in the data:\n    ```json\n    [\n      1984,\n      \"brighton hotel bombing\",\n      \"brighton , uk\",\n      \"ira\",\n      \"5\"\n    ]\n    ```\n\n- **Verify Location**: \n  - For the identified event, check the column named \"location\" to see where the bombing occurred. The location is listed as \"brighton, uk.\"\n\nNow, compare this with the claim:\n\n- The claim states that the \"brighton hotel bombing\" happened in \"enniskillen, uk.\"\n- However, according to our verification from the table, it actually took place in \"brighton, uk.\"\n\nSince the claimed location \"enniskillen, uk\" does not match the actual location \"brighton, uk,\" the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this are:\n- The row index where \"brighton hotel bombing\" appears: 14\n- The column name for checking the location of the event: \"location\"\n\nHere's the JSON response reflecting our conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
