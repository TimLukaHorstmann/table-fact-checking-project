    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the latest prr class locomotive be build the year before 1967,\" we need to identify which rows in the table have data relevant to this claim and check their \"build date\" column.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: \n   - We need to find the most recent (latest) locomotive based on its build year.\n   - The condition is that this latest locomotive should be built before 1967.\n\n2. **Relevant Column**:\n   - The relevant column for verifying the claim is \"build date.\"\n\n3. **Checking Each Row**:\n   - We will examine each row's \"build date\" to find the most recent year.\n   - Compare these years to see if the latest one is before 1967.\n\n4. **Row Analysis**:\n\n   - Row 0: \n     - Build Date: 1948 - 1950\n     - Latest possible build year: 1950\n   \n   - Row 1:\n     - Build Date: 1965\n\n   - Row 2:\n     - Build Date: 1965\n   \n   - Row 3:\n     - Build Date: 1966\n\n   - Row 4:\n     - Build Date: 1967\n     - This is the most recent year, but we need it to be before 1967 according to the claim.\n\n5. **Determine Latest Year**:\n   - The latest build year in the table is 1967 (Row 4).\n   - However, the claim specifies that the latest locomotive should be built *before* 1967.\n   - Therefore, Row 4 does not satisfy the condition of being before 1967.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The most recent year that meets the condition is 1966 (Row 3).\n\n7. **Verification**:\n   - Since the latest locomotive built *before* 1967 was in 1966, the claim is supported by the data.\n\nBased on this analysis, here's the JSON object representing our conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"build date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"build date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"build date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"build date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"build date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
