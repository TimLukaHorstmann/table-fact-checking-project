The name of this player is David Tapping.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant data in the table:\n\n### Data Analysis\n- **Player and Country Information:**\n  - We focus on the \"player\" and \"country\" columns to verify these conditions.\n\n1. Identify all players from England:\n   - Row index 4 has a player named \"david tapping\" with the country listed as \"england.\"\n\n2. Check if there are any other players from England:\n   - No other rows in the table list a player from England besides row index 4.\n\n3. Verify the name of the English player:\n   - The name given for the player from England is \"david tapping,\" which matches part of the claim (though the claim mentions \"david tap\").\n\n### Conclusion\n- There is indeed only one player from England, and their full name in the table is \"david tapping.\"\n- The minor discrepancy between \"david tap\" in the claim and \"david tapping\" in the table does not invalidate the claim if we consider it a common shorthand.\n\nGiven this analysis, both conditions of the claim are satisfied.

Check if Jay Haas is one of these players.\n3. Confirm that no other player has a total score of 141.\n\nLet's analyze the table data:\n\n- The \"score\" column shows the total scores for each player.\n- We need to find all entries where the score is \"71 + 70 = 141\".\n- Additionally, we need to verify if any other players have the same total score of 141.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n1. **Row 9**: Mark Calcavecchia has a score of \"74 + 67 = 141\".\n2. **Row 10**: Jay Haas has a score of \"71 + 70 = 141\".\n3. **Row 11**: Davis Love III has a score of \"70 + 71 = 141\".\n4. **Row 12**: Tom Watson also has a score of \"71 + 70 = 141\".\n\nJay Haas is indeed one of the players with a total score of 141, but he is not the only player with this score.
