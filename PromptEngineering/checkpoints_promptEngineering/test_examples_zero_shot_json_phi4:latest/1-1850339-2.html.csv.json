The claim implies that from the earliest year available (1972) through 2018, there should be no \"tbd\" or any indication that the match was not decided.\n   \n2. We will go through each row of the data for years up to and including 2018:\n\n   - From 1972 to 2011, all rows have a definite score for \"air force - navy.\" There are no entries with \"tbd\" or any indication that these scores were not decided.\n   \n   - For the year 2012, the score is listed as \"28 - 21 (ot)\" which also indicates it was decided in overtime.\n\n3. In 2014 and 2016, there are entries labeled \"tbd,\" but the claim specifically relates to games that have been played up until 2018. Since these years involve future dates beyond the 2012 season (which ended by December 2012), they do not contradict the condition for scores being decided \"up until 2018.\"\n\n4. For 2018, there is a row with \"tbd,\" which means the match was scheduled but not played at that point in time when the data was recorded. However, since this matches the upper boundary condition of \"up until 2018\" (i.e., before the 2019 season), it does not violate the claim because no results for beyond 2018 are required.\n\nSince every game from 1972 through 2011 has a decided score, and the inclusion of future dates like those in 2014, 2016, and 2018 as \"tbd\" is consistent with them being scheduled after the end of the 2012 season, the claim holds true for scores decided up until the beginning of the 2019 season.\n\nThus, the relevant cells to verify this claim are all rows from 1972 to 2011 in the column \"air force - navy score.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 37, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 38, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"all but 1 season be about to have or have an army - navy game in Baltimore, MD (M&T Bank Stadium).\"\n\n2. We need to check whether the Army-Navy games were played at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, MD, for each season from 1972 onward, with exceptions specified as \"tbd\" being considered pending and thus still potentially occurring there.\n\n3. Relevant data column: \n   - The column \"army - navy score\" contains game results and mentions the location if applicable.\n\n4. Specific years to focus on:\n   - From the table, starting in 2012, we observe that specific dates and locations for Army-Navy games are listed, such as \"13 dec 2014 at Baltimore, MD (M&T Bank Stadium)\" and similar entries for 2016 and 2018.\n   \n5. Analyze each row from 1972 to 2011:\n   - No location is specified in the \"army - navy score\" column until 2012; hence we assume that these games were not at M&T Bank Stadium.\n\n6. Check exceptions:\n   - For seasons marked as \"tbd\" (like 2014, 2016, and 2018), these are noted as pending or future events and cannot be assumed to not occur in Baltimore.\n\n7. Conclusion based on the analysis:\n   - From 1972 to 2011, none of the Army-Navy games listed were held at M&T Bank Stadium.\n   - For years marked \"tbd\", we do not have definitive information; they are pending or future events and thus cannot be counted as exceptions.\n   - Only one explicit mention of Baltimore is from 2012 onward. Therefore, all seasons before that (1972 to 2011) did not feature the game in Baltimore.\n\n8. The claim states \"all but 1 season\", indicating that only a single exception should exist:\n   - Since no games were held at M&T Bank Stadium for any of the years from 1972 to 2011, and with pending years potentially planned there (tbd), we have more than one season that hasn't had or is not about to have an Army-Navy game in Baltimore.\n\nThus, based on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"army - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"army - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"army - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"army - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"army - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"army - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"army - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"army - navy score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
