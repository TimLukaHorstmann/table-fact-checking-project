Identify the relevant data for Marc Surer's points across the years 1984 and 1985.\n2. Verify if there are any entries that explicitly mention Marc Surer as the \"entrant.\"\n3. Calculate the difference in points scored by Marc Surer between these two years.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- The table lists multiple entrants per year but does not directly mention drivers like Marc Surer. We need to infer based on known historical data.\n- Historically, Marc Surer drove for Arrows Racing Team and later for Brabham in 1985.\n\nNow, let's check the relevant entries from the table:\n\n1. **For the Year 1984:**\n   - There are two entries:\n     - Row 9: \"barclay nordica arrows bmw\" with points = 1\n     - Row 10: \"barclay nordica arrows bmw\" with points = 1\n\n   Since Marc Surer was part of the Arrows team in 1984, he would have been associated with these entries. The total points for Arrows in 1984 is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\).\n\n2. **For the Year 1985:**\n   - There is one entry:\n     - Row 11: \"motor racing developments ltd\" (Brabham) with points = 5\n\n   Marc Surer drove for Brabham in 1985, so he would have scored these 5 points.\n\nNow, calculate the difference in points:\n\n- Points in 1984: 2\n- Points in 1985: 5\n- Difference: \\(5 - 2 = 3\\)\n\nThe claim states that Marc Surer scored \"4 more points\" in 1985 compared to 1984. However, based on our calculations, he scored only 3 more points.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n\nHere are the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- Row 9: Points = 1 (for Arrows in 1984)\n- Row 10: Points = 1 (for Arrows in 1984)\n- Row 11: Points = 5 (for Brabham in 1985)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Marc Surer scored a total of 9 points in his 4 races in 1982,\" we need to identify and verify each part of this statement using the given table data.\n\n### Breaking Down the Claim:\n\n1. **Year**: The claim refers to the year 1982.\n2. **Driver Name**: Marc Surer is mentioned as the driver.\n3. **Points Scored**: A total of 9 points are claimed.\n4. **Number of Races**: It mentions that this score came from participating in 4 races.\n\n### Steps for Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Entries for Year 1982**:\n   - We need to filter data entries where the \"year\" column is 1982.\n\n2. **Check Driver Name**:\n   - The table does not have a specific column for driver names, so we must rely on external knowledge that Marc Surer drove in these races or assume he did if additional context suggests this (not directly verifiable from the given data).\n\n3. **Sum of Points**:\n   - Calculate the total points scored by adding up the \"points\" values for all relevant entries.\n\n4. **Count Number of Races**:\n   - Count how many race entries are associated with Marc Surer in 1982.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Filtering Data for Year 1982**:\n   - Relevant rows from the table where year = 1982:\n     - Row index 5: `arrows racing team`, `arrows a4`, `cosworth v8`, points = 3\n     - Row index 6: `arrows racing team`, `arrows a5`, `cosworth v8`, points = 3\n\n2. **Sum of Points**:\n   - Total points from these entries = 3 (Row 5) + 3 (Row 6) = 6 points.\n\n3. **Count Number of Races**:\n   - There are 2 race entries in 1982 as per the data provided.\n\n4. **Verification Against Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Marc Surer scored a total of 9 points and participated in 4 races.\n   - From our analysis: Total points = 6, Number of races = 2.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe information derived from the table does not support the claim. The actual total points for the year 1982 are 6 (not 9), and there were only 2 entries (races) listed for that year, not 4 as claimed.\n\nThus, based on the given data and the breakdown above, the correct response to the claim is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
