    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"more than 3 drivers had to retire because of a gearbox issue\" is true or false based on the given table, we need to analyze the data for instances where the \"time / retired\" column contains the word \"gearbox.\"\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The relevant column for this claim is \"time / retired,\" as it indicates why a driver did not complete all laps.\n\n2. **Search for Gearbox Issues**: We need to count how many entries in the \"time / retired\" column contain the word \"gearbox.\"\n\n3. **Extract Relevant Rows**:\n   - Row 16: Bertrand Gachot, \"gearbox\"\n   - Row 20: Andrea Montermini, \"gearbox\"\n   - Row 23: Jos Verstappen, \"gearbox\"\n\n4. **Count Instances**: There are three instances where drivers retired due to a gearbox issue.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that more than 3 drivers retired because of a gearbox issue.\n   - We found only 3 instances, which does not satisfy the condition of \"more than 3.\"\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since there are exactly 3 drivers who retired due to gearbox issues and not more than 3, the claim is false.\n\n7. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - Row indices for relevant cells where the retirement reason was a gearbox issue: 16, 20, 23.\n   - Column name for these entries: \"time / retired.\"\n\nThus, the JSON output will be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
