    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding Aniket Dhadphale and his association with the San Jose Sharks and nationality, we need to verify specific pieces of information from the provided table.\n\nThe claim states: \"Aniket Dhadphale, the NHL team player of the San Jose Shark(s), be from the United States.\"\n\nHere's how we break down this verification:\n\n1. **Player Identification**:\n   - We need to find a row in the data where the `player` column matches \"aniket dhadphale\".\n\n2. **NHL Team Verification**:\n   - For the identified player, check if the `nhl team` column states that he plays for the \"san jose sharks\". It's important to note the plural form used in the claim (\"Shark(s)\"), but we'll assume it refers to the singular \"San Jose Sharks\" as per standard team naming.\n\n3. **Nationality Verification**:\n   - For the identified player, verify if the `nationality` column states that he is from the \"united states\".\n\nLet's apply these checks on the table:\n\n- We find Aniket Dhadphale in row 245.\n  - The corresponding entry for `nhl team` in this row is \"san jose sharks\".\n  - The corresponding entry for `nationality` in this row is \"united states\".\n\nSince all conditions of the claim are met, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's specify which cells were relevant to verify the claim:\n\n- Row index 245, column name \"player\" (to identify Aniket Dhadphale).\n- Row index 245, column name \"nhl team\" (to confirm he plays for the San Jose Sharks).\n- Row index 245, column name \"nationality\" (to confirm his nationality as United States).\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 244, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 244, \"column_name\": \"nhl team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 244, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We look at the \"data\" array to find a row where the player name is \"tero lehtera\".\n  \n  - In row 0, the \"player\" column contains \"tero lehtera\".\n\n- **Condition 2**: The position should be \"centre\".\n\n  - In row 0, the \"position\" column contains \"centre\", matching our condition.\n\n- **Condition 3**: The NHL team picking him should be \"Florida Panthers\".\n\n  - In row 0, the \"nhl team\" column contains \"florida panthers\". Note that the capitalization is different (\"Florida Panthers\" in the claim vs. \"florida panthers\" in the table), but this difference does not affect the validity of the information since it still refers to the same NHL team.\n\nSince all conditions are satisfied with row 0:\n\n- The player \"tero lehtera\" plays as a \"centre\".\n- He was picked by the \"Florida Panthers\".\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.
