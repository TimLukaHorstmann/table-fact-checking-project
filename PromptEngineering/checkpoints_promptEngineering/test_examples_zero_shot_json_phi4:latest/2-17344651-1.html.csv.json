    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if all players listed in the table as drafted by the Celtics during the 1984-85 NBA draft season are from the United States.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"All of the Celtic draft picks from the 1984 - 85 season come from the United States.\"\n\n### Table Structure:\n- The table is a JSON object with two main keys: `columns` and `data`.\n- The `columns` key contains an array of strings that represent the names of columns.\n- The `data` key contains an array of arrays, where each sub-array represents a row in the table. Each sub-array has five elements corresponding to \"round\", \"pick\", \"player\", \"nationality\", and \"college\".\n\n### Verification Steps:\n1. Identify the relevant column for verification: \"nationality\". This column will tell us if each player's nationality is \"United States\".\n2. Check each row in the `data` array to see if the value under the \"nationality\" column matches \"united states\" (case insensitive).\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For each row, we need to check the cell under the \"nationality\" column.\n\nLet's go through each row and check:\n\n1. Row 0: Nationality is \"united states\".\n2. Row 1: Nationality is \"united states\".\n3. Row 2: Nationality is \"united states\".\n4. Row 3: Nationality is \"united states\".\n5. Row 4: Nationality is \"united states\".\n6. Row 5: Nationality is \"united states\".\n7. Row 6: Nationality is \"united states\".\n8. Row 7: Nationality is \"united states\".\n9. Row 8: Nationality is \"united states\".\n10. Row 9: Nationality is \"united states\".\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll players listed have their nationality as \"united states\".

The final pick was Dan Trant.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n- For verifying the final pick: Row index 10, Column \"player\".\n- For verifying each player's position:\n  - Ronnie Williams: Row index 1, Column \"player\".\n  - Rick Carlisle: Row index 2, Column \"player\".\n  - Michael Young: Row index 0, Column \"player\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"a single draft pick by the Celtic 1984 have a first name that begins with the letter 'r'\", we must examine the relevant data in the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - The claim pertains to a draft associated with \"the Celtic 1984\". We should focus on each player's first name since the claim is about names starting with 'R'.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - For every row in the data, we need to look at the column named \"player\" and check if the first name begins with 'R'.\n   \n3. **Iterate Through Data Rows**:\n\n    - **Row 0**: Player is \"michael young\"\n        - First name: \"Michael\". Does not start with 'R'.\n\n    - **Row 1**: Player is \"ronnie williams\"\n        - First name: \"Ronnie\". Starts with 'R'.\n        \n    - **Row 2**: Player is \"rick carlisle\"\n        - First name: \"Rick\". Starts with 'R'.\n        \n    - **Row 3**: Player is \"kevin mullin\"\n        - First name: \"Kevin\". Does not start with 'R'.\n\n    - **Row 4**: Player is \"todd orlando\"\n        - First name: \"Todd\". Does not start with 'R'.\n\n    - **Row 5**: Player is \"steve carfino\"\n        - First name: \"Steve\". Does not start with 'R'.\n        \n    - **Row 6**: Player is \"mark van valkenburg\"\n        - First name: \"Mark\". Does not start with 'R'.\n        \n    - **Row 7**: Player is \"champ godboldt\"\n        - First name: \"Champ\". Does not start with 'R'.\n        \n    - **Row 8**: Player is \"joe dixon\"\n        - First name: \"Joe\". Does not start with 'R'.\n        \n    - **Row 9**: Player is \"dan trant\"\n        - First name: \"Dan\". Does not start with 'R'.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - There are two players, \"Ronnie Williams\" and \"Rick Carlisle\", whose first names begin with 'R'. The claim states that there should be a \"single draft pick\" (i.e., only one) with such a name.\n\n5. **Determine Truth Value**:\n   - Since there are two players meeting the criteria, the condition for having a single player is not met.\n\n### JSON Response\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE because more than one player's first name starts with 'R'.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n``` \n\nThis response includes the relevant rows where players' names begin with 'R', which are crucial for evaluating the claim.",
