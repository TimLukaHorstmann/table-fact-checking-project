The number of laps is 105.\n2. The \"Time / Retired\" value is \"+ 6.18\".\n\nLet's examine the data in the table:\n\n- Row 0: Lorenzo Bandini, Ferrari, Laps = 105, Time / Retired = \"2:06:18.23\"\n- Row 1: Richie Ginther, BRM, Laps = 105, Time / Retired = \"+ 6.18\"\n\nFrom this analysis:\n- Row 1 matches both conditions specified in the claim (Laps = 105 and Time / Retired = \"+ 6.18\").\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are therefore:\n\n- In row 1, the column \"laps\" has a value of 105.\n- In row 1, the column \"time / retired\" has a value of \"+ 6.18\".\n\nBased on this examination, the claim is supported by exactly one entry in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim against the provided table, we need to verify two conditions:\n\n1. The number of laps completed is 104.\n2. The time/retired value is \"+ 6.18\".\n3. There should be exactly one entry that matches both conditions.\n\nLet's analyze the data step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Check for Laps = 104\n\nWe need to find entries in the table where the \"laps\" column equals 104. Reviewing each row:\n- None of the drivers have completed exactly 104 laps.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Time/Retired = \"+ 6.18\"\n\nNext, we check if any entry has a time/retired value of \"+ 6.18\":\n- The second driver, Richie Ginther, from BRM, has a time/retired of \"+ 6.18\". However, he completed 105 laps.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince no driver completed exactly 104 laps, the first condition is not met by any entry in the table. Therefore, there cannot be an entry that satisfies both conditions simultaneously.\n\nAs a result, the claim is false because:\n- There are no entries with 104 laps.\n- The only entry with a time/retired of \"+ 6.18\" does not have 104 laps.\n\nThe relevant cell for verifying the second condition (time/retired) is:\n- Richie Ginther's row, which corresponds to `row_index: 1` and column \"time / retired\".\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
