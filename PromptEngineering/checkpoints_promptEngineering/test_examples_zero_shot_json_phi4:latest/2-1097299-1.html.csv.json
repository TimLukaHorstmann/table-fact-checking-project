    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim \"the chief justice be appoint in 2011,\" we need to verify whether there is an entry for a Chief Justice appointed in the year 2011 within the provided table.\n\nFirst, identify relevant information:\n- The column \"rank\" specifies if someone holds the position of \"Chief Justice.\"\n- The column \"year appointed\" indicates when they were appointed.\n- We are interested in finding any row where \"rank\" is \"chief justice\" and \"year appointed\" is 2011.\n\nNow let's examine each row related to these columns:\n\n1. **Row 3**: \n   - Rank: Chief Justice\n   - Year Appointed: 2004\n\nThis row is relevant because it confirms the position of a Chief Justice, but the year appointed is 2004, not 2011.\n\nNo other rows have \"Chief Justice\" as their rank, so there are no additional entries to consider for the year 2011.\n\nConclusion:\n- The claim states that the Chief Justice was appointed in 2011.\n- Based on the table data, the Chief Justice was actually appointed in 2004.\n- Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cell for verification is:\n- Row index: 3\n- Column name: \"rank\"\n- (Additionally, to fully verify the year of appointment, also consider:)\n- Row index: 3\n- Column name: \"year appointed\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year appointed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
