We need to find if there are more than two such instances.\n\n### Table Examination:\n\nLet's go through each entry and check the \"venue\" column to see whether it contains the word \"oval\":\n\n1. **Row 0:**\n   - Venue: \"arden street oval\"\n   - Contains 'oval': Yes\n\n2. **Row 1:**\n   - Venue: \"mcg\"\n   - Contains 'oval': No\n\n3. **Row 2:**\n   - Venue: \"western oval\"\n   - Contains 'oval': Yes\n\n4. **Row 3:**\n   - Venue: \"brunswick street oval\"\n   - Contains 'oval': Yes\n\n5. **Row 4:**\n   - Venue: \"junction oval\"\n   - Contains 'oval': Yes\n\n6. **Row 5:**\n   - Venue: \"windy hill\"\n   - Contains 'oval': No\n\n### Counting Non-'Oval' Venues:\nFrom the above analysis, we find that the following rows have venues without 'oval':\n\n- Row 1: \"mcg\"\n- Row 5: \"windy hill\"\n\nThere are exactly two instances where the venue does not contain 'oval'.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim states there should be more than two such cases. Since there are only two, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nThe relevant cells are those that help determine whether a venue name contains 'oval' or not. These are:\n\n- Row 1, Column \"venue\"\n- Row 5, Column \"venue\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to break down and analyze it step by step:\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"more than 3 score from both home and away team be less than 10 point\".\n\n- **\"More than 3 score\":** In Australian Rules Football scoring, a \"score\" typically refers to goals. A goal is worth 6 points. Thus, \"more than 3 score\" means that the total number of goals (each worth 6 points) should exceed 18 points.\n\n- **\"Be less than 10 point\":** This part suggests that after converting scores into points by considering goals and behinds, the overall point count must be under 10. However, this interpretation doesn't align with football scoring norms since a score of 3 goals (exceeding 18 points) itself is already over 10 points.\n\n### Verification:\nWe need to check each game in the data to see if both teams meet the condition of having more than 18 points but under 10 total points, which based on our understanding seems contradictory. Let's verify:\n\n1. **Row 0:**\n   - Home Team (North Melbourne): 10.20 (80)\n     - Goals = 10 \u00d7 6 = 60\n     - Behinds = 20 \u00d7 1 = 20\n     - Total Points = 80\n   - Away Team (South Melbourne): 17.11 (113)\n     - Goals = 17 \u00d7 6 = 102\n     - Behinds = 11 \u00d7 1 = 11\n     - Total Points = 113\n\n2. **Row 1:**\n   - Home Team (Melbourne): 18.12 (120)\n     - Goals = 18 \u00d7 6 = 108\n     - Behinds = 12 \u00d7 1 = 12\n     - Total Points = 120\n   - Away Team (Richmond): 10.11 (71)\n     - Goals = 10 \u00d7 6 = 60\n     - Behinds = 11 \u00d7 1 = 11\n     - Total Points = 71\n\n3. **Row 2:**\n   - Home Team (Footscray): 8.11 (59)\n     - Goals = 8 \u00d7 6 = 48\n     - Behinds = 11 \u00d7 1 = 11\n     - Total Points = 59\n   - Away Team (Hawthorn): 7.15 (57)\n     - Goals = 7 \u00d7 6 = 42\n     - Behinds = 15 \u00d7 1 = 15\n     - Total Points = 57\n\n4. **Row 3:**\n   - Home Team (Fitzroy): 15.14 (104)\n     - Goals = 15 \u00d7 6 = 90\n     - Behinds = 14 \u00d7 1 = 14\n     - Total Points = 104\n   - Away Team (Geelong): 10.20 (80)\n     - Goals = 10 \u00d7 6 = 60\n     - Behinds = 20 \u00d7 1 = 20\n     - Total Points = 80\n\n5. **Row 4:**\n   - Home Team (St Kilda): 14.12 (96)\n     - Goals = 14 \u00d7 6 = 84\n     - Behinds = 12 \u00d7 1 = 12\n     - Total Points = 96\n   - Away Team (Collingwood): 7.14 (56)\n     - Goals = 7 \u00d7 6 = 42\n     - Behinds = 14 \u00d7 1 = 14\n     - Total Points = 56\n\n6. **Row 5:**\n   - Home Team (Essendon): 17.21 (123)\n     - Goals = 17 \u00d7 6 = 102\n     - Behinds = 21 \u00d7 1 = 21\n     - Total Points = 123\n   - Away Team (Carlton): 9.8 (62)\n     - Goals = 9 \u00d7 6 = 54\n     - Behinds = 8 \u00d7 1 = 8\n     - Total Points = 62\n\n### Conclusion:\n- For each row, there are no instances where both home and away teams have more than 18 points but less than 10 total points. The condition itself is logically inconsistent with the scoring system.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.
