Extract the scores for these games to compare how many points Washington scored against each team.\n\n3. From the data:\n   - On November 5, Washington scored 0 points against Carolina.\n   - On November 30, Washington scored 3 points against Carolina.\n   - On November 26, Washington scored 3 points against Buffalo.\n\n4. Compare Washington's scores:\n   - Against Carolina: The maximum score is 3 (on November 30).\n   - Against Buffalo: The score is 3 (on November 26).\n\n5. Analysis of the claim:\n   - Washington scored 3 points against both Carolina (November 30) and Buffalo.\n   - Therefore, it's not true that Washington scored fewer points in the game against Carolina than Buffalo.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells for verification are:\n- November 5: Score \"0 - 5\" (Carolina)\n- November 26: Score \"3 - 1\" (Buffalo)\n- November 30: Score \"3 - 4\" (Carolina)\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
