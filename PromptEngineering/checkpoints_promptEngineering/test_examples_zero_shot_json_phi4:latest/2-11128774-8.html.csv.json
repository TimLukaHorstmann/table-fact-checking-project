    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"during the season, the second most goals Vancouver scored in a single game be 8,\" we need to identify all games where Vancouver was the home team and review the scores they achieved.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - The relevant rows are those where \"vancouver\" is listed as the visitor.\n   - These occur on April 1, April 3, April 4, April 9, April 11, April 13, and April 15.\n\n2. **Extract Vancouver's Scores in Each Game:**\n   - For each game where Vancouver was the visitor, extract the score they achieved from the \"score\" column.\n     - April 1: Score = 5\n     - April 3: Score = 1\n     - April 4: Score = 3\n     - April 9: Score = 1\n     - April 11: Score = 6\n     - April 13: Score = 7\n     - April 15: Score = 8\n\n3. **Determine the Highest and Second Highest Scores:**\n   - Sort these scores in descending order to find the highest and second highest:\n     - Scores sorted: 8, 7, 6, 5, 3, 1, 1\n   - The highest score is 8.\n   - The second highest score is 7.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - According to the claim, the second most goals Vancouver scored should be 8. However, from our sorting, we found that the second most goals are actually 7, not 8.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - The relevant cells contain scores for games where \"vancouver\" was the visitor.\n   - These correspond to the following rows and columns:\n     - April 1 (row index 0), \"score\": 5\n     - April 3 (row index 1), \"score\": 1\n     - April 4 (row index 2), \"score\": 3\n     - April 9 (row index 4), \"score\": 1\n     - April 11 (row index 5), \"score\": 6\n     - April 13 (row index 6), \"score\": 7\n     - April 15 (row index 7), \"score\": 8\n\nThe claim is therefore FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
