Check the score of that specific game.\n\nAccording to the claim, the game's outcome should be \"w 97 - 72 (ot)\" when playing against Detroit.\n\nLet\u2019s examine the data:\n\n- The relevant row in the dataset for a game against Detroit is at `row_index` 0:\n  - **Game**: 19\n  - **Date**: December 1\n  - **Team**: Detroit\n  - **Score**: w 97 - 72 (ot)\n\nThe score for this game matches exactly with the claim.
