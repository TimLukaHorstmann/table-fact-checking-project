    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"player in the 1937 master tournament have to play 4 rounds\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to evaluate if each player listed played exactly four rounds.\n\n1. **Understanding the Table:**\n   - The table includes columns for `place`, `player`, `country`, `score`, `to par`, and `money`.\n   - Each row represents a player's performance in terms of their total score across multiple rounds, which is broken down as four separate scores combined (e.g., \"66 + 72 + 75 + 70 = 283\").\n\n2. **Analyzing the Claim:**\n   - The claim asserts that each player had to play 4 rounds.\n   - To verify this, we need to check if the `score` column for each row shows four individual round scores added together.\n\n3. **Checking Each Row:**\n   - For each entry in the data:\n     - Check the format of the score which is expressed as \"Round1 + Round2 + Round3 + Round4 = Total\".\n     - Ensure that there are exactly four rounds listed before the equals sign.\n\n4. **Verification Process:**\n   - Iterate through each row and examine the `score` column.\n   - Confirm that all scores follow the pattern of four individual round scores being summed up to a total score.\n\n5. **Results:**\n   - All rows in the data show scores formatted as four separate rounds added together (e.g., \"66 + 72 + 75 + 70 = 283\").\n   - This confirms that each player played exactly four rounds.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since every row adheres to this format, the claim is supported by the table data.\n\n7. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells for verification are those in the `score` column across all rows (indices 0 through 10).\n\nHere's the JSON object representing the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"no player scored below 70 in the final round\" is true or false, we need to examine each row of the table for the scores in the final round (fourth day). Specifically, we focus on the fourth element of each data array as it represents the score for that round. \n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0:** Byron Nelson scored \"70\" in the final round.\n2. **Row 1:** Ralph Guldahl scored \"76\" in the final round.\n3. **Row 2:** Ed Dudley scored \"74\" in the final round.\n4. **Row 3:** Harry Cooper scored \"74\" in the final round.\n5. **Row 4:** Ky LaFoon scored \"73\" in the final round.\n6. **Row 5:** Jimmy Thomson scored \"73\" in the final round.\n7. **Row 6:** Al Watrous scored \"75\" in the final round.\n8. **Row 7:** Tommy Armour scored \"72\" in the final round.\n9. **Row 8:** Vic Ghezzi scored \"77\" in the final round.\n10. **Row 9:** Leonard Dodson scored \"77\" in the final round.\n11. **Row 10:** Jimmy Hines scored \"77\" in the final round.\n\nReviewing each player's score on the fourth day, we see that no player scored below 70.
