By iterating through the data, we find that row index 22 corresponds to May 26.\n\n2. **Verify Opponent:**\n   - According to the claim, the game was against the Pirates.\n   - In row index 22, under the column \"opponent\", it is listed as \"pirates\". This matches the team mentioned in the claim (note that case sensitivity doesn't matter here).\n\n3. **Check Attendance:**\n   - The attendance figure given in the claim is 40,225.\n   - We need to check this against the \"attendance\" column for the same row index (22).\n   - In row index 22, under the \"attendance\" column, the value is indeed \"40225\".\n\nSince both the opponent and the attendance figures match those specified in the claim, we can confirm that the claim is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe relevant cells from the table that were checked to verify this claim are:\n- Row index 22, \"opponent\" (to check against the Pirates)\n- Row index 22, \"attendance\" (to verify it as 40225)\n\nTherefore, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The game occurred against the \"Brewers.\"\n2. The score was \"9 - 6.\"\n3. The attendance figure is \"34240.\"\n\nLet's break down how each part of this claim can be verified using the table:\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n1. **Identify Date and Opponent**:\n   - We are interested in a game against the Brewers on May 7.\n   - Locate the row with \"may 7\" under the \"date\" column.\n\n2. **Verify Score**:\n   - Within this identified row, check the \"score\" column to see if it matches \"9 - 6.\"\n\n3. **Check Attendance**:\n   - If the score is correct, examine the \"attendance\" column in the same row for the number \"34240.\"\n\n### Relevant Row Search\n\n- Locate the row with date: \"may 7.\"\n- In this row, verify that the opponent is \"brewers.\"\n- Verify the score: \"9 - 6.\"\n- Confirm the attendance figure: \"34240.\"\n\nBy checking these conditions in sequence:\n\n1.

Therefore, we only need to focus on the row corresponding to May 7 to determine this.\n\nHere's the JSON representation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
