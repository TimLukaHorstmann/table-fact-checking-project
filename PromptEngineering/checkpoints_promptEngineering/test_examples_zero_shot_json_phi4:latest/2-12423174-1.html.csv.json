The result between ASC Diaraf and Stade Malien.\n2. The specific tournament year (1971).\n\n**Step-by-step Verification:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data in Table:**\n   - Look for a row where the teams are \"asc diaraf\" and \"stade malien\".\n   - Check the aggregated result (\"agg\") to see if ASC Diaraf lost.\n   \n2. **Checking Results:**\n   - In the table, find the entry:\n     ```\n     [\n       \"asc diaraf\",\n       \"3 - 4\",\n       \"stade malien\",\n       \"3 - 0\",\n       \"0 - 4\"\n     ]\n     ```\n   - The aggregated score is \"3 - 4\", indicating ASC Diaraf lost to Stade Malien.\n\n3. **Check for Year of Tournament:**\n   - The table does not provide any information about the year of the match.\n   - The claim mentions the year 1971, but this specific detail is absent from the data provided in the JSON.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Based on the table data alone, ASC Diaraf did indeed lose to Stade Malien with an aggregate score of \"3 - 4\".\n- However, there's no information in the table about the year being 1971.\n  \nSince we cannot verify the tournament year from the provided JSON data, we cannot fully support the claim. Therefore, the answer must be FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- The row containing ASC Diaraf and Stade Malien is at index 2.\n- Relevant columns are \"agg\" (column 1), \"team 1\" (column 0), and \"team 2\" (column 2).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
