Whether this title matches \"New York: Secret Societies\".\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- **Identify the relevant row**: We need to find the row where the \"original airdate\" is \"March 31, 2008\". From the table data, this corresponds to the row with index 9.\n\n- **Check the episode title for that date**: In row 9, we look at the column \"episode title\" to see if it matches \"New York: Secret Societies\".\n\nFrom the table:\n- Row index 9 has an \"original airdate\" of \"March 31, 2008\".\n- The corresponding \"episode title\" in this row is indeed \"New York: Secret Societies\".\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, so the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- The cell at row index 9 for the column \"original airdate\".\n- The cell at row index 9 for the column \"episode title\".\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The episode number should be 202.\n2. The original airdate for that episode should be February 4, 2008.\n\nLet's examine the relevant rows in the data provided:\n\n- We look at each row to find where \"episode no\" is 202.\n- For the row with \"episode no\" equal to 202, we check if the \"original airdate\" matches \"February 4, 2008\".\n\nHere\u2019s how it breaks down based on the table's data:\n\n1. **Row Search for Episode No:**\n   - Row 0 has episode no 201.\n   - **Row 1** has episode no **202**.\n\n2. **Check Airdate in Relevant Row:**\n   - In Row 1, the \"original airdate\" is listed as \"February 4, 2008\".\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied for Row 1:\n\n- Episode number (column) matches 202.\n- Original airdate (column) matches February 4, 2008.\n\nThus, the claim is true.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim against the provided table data, we need to verify two main conditions from the claim: \n1. The episode title for January 28, 2008.\n2. The host of this particular episode.\n\nLet's break down these steps:\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **Locate the Episode with Original Airdate \"January 28, 2008\":**\n\n   - Check each row in the data for a match to the airdate \"january 28 , 2008\".\n   - From the table:\n     ```json\n     [\n       [\"15\", \"201\", \"january 28 , 2008\", \"underground apocalypse\", \"don wildman\"]\n     ]\n     ```\n   - The row with index 0 matches this date.\n\n2. **Verify the Episode Title for January 28, 2008:**\n\n   - From the identified row (index 0), extract the episode title:\n     - The value is \"underground apocalypse\".\n   - According to the claim, the title should be \"vietnam\". This does not match.\n\n3. **Check the Host for the Episode on January 28, 2008:**\n\n   - From the same row (index 0), verify the host:\n     - The value is \"don wildman\".\n   - According to the claim, the host should be \"don wildman\". This matches.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim specifies two conditions that need to be true for it to be considered fully supported:\n- The episode title on January 28, 2008, must be \"vietnam\".\n- The host of this episode must be \"don wildman\".\n\nOnly the second condition is met; therefore, the entire claim is not correct.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells that needed verification are found in row index 0 for both \"episode title\" and \"host\". \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"host\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"episode number 213 aired on January 28, 2008\" is true or false, we need to verify two pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. The original airdate for episode number 213.\n2. The original airdate given in the claim (January 28, 2008).\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Identify Episode Number:**\n   - Look for a row where \"episode no\" is 213.\n\n2. **Check Original Airdate:**\n   - Once we find the correct row, check the value of \"original airdate\".\n\n3. **Compare with Claimed Date:**\n   - Compare the found original airdate with January 28, 2008.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- From the table:\n  - The episode number 213 corresponds to a row where:\n    - `production no`: 27\n    - `episode no`: 213\n    - `original airdate`: \"may 5 , 2008\"\n    - `episode title`: \"secret soviet bases\"\n    - `host`: \"don wildman\"\n\n- The original airdate for episode number 213 is May 5, 2008.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that episode number 213 aired on January 28, 2008. However, the table shows it aired on May 5, 2008. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cells to verify this are:\n  - Row index 12 (0-based indexing) for column \"episode no\" with value 213.\n  - Row index 12 for column \"original airdate\" with value \"may 5 , 2008\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"episode no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
