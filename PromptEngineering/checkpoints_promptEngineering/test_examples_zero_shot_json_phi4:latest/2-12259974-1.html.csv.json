The row where \"capital\" is \"shizuoka\" corresponds to the last entry before the list ends.\n  \n- Extract the population for this city from the \"population\" column, which shows 709888.\n\n- Compare this value with the claim:\n  - Claimed sum: 709888\n  - Actual population in the table for Shizuoka: 709888\n\nSince both values match, the claim is supported by the data.\n\nFinally, let's construct the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 37, \"column_name\": \"population\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The row index for Shizuoka is 37 (considering zero-based indexing).\n- The column name containing the population data is \"population.\"",
