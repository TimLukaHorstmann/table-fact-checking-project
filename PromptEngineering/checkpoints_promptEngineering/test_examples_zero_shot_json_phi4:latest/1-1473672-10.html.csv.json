    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify each condition of the claim against the data in the table.\n\n1. **Claim Condition**: \"right wing\"\n   - We need to find a player with the position as \"right wing.\"\n\n2. **Claim Condition**: \"rene lampert\"\n   - The name provided in the claim is \"rene lampert.\" However, checking for any spelling errors or variations, it seems like \"rene lambert\" from the table might be intended.\n\n3. **Claim Condition**: \"be pick 145th\"\n   - This means we need to find a player who was picked 145th.\n\n### Verification Process:\n\n- **Position Check**: \n  - We look for players with the position \"right wing.\"\n\n- **Player Name Check**:\n  - We compare the name in the claim (\"rene lampert\") with names in the table. Noting that there might be a typo, we find \"rene lambert\" which closely matches.\n\n- **Pick Number Check**: \n  - We need to check if this player was picked as number 145th.\n\n### Relevant Data from Table:\n\n1. The row for pick 146 has:\n   - Player: Rene Lambert\n   - Position: Right Wing\n\n2. The row with pick 145 is:\n   - Pick: 145\n   - Player: Steve Lyon\n   - Position: Defence (not \"right wing\")\n\nSince the player Rene Lambert, whose name matches closely with \"rene lampert,\" was actually picked as number 146 and not 145, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- For verifying position:\n  - Row index 2 (\"pick\" = 146) in column \"position\"\n  \n- For verifying the player's name:\n  - Row index 2 (\"pick\" = 146) in column \"player\"\n\n- For verifying the pick number:\n  - Row index 1 (\"pick\" = 145)\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
