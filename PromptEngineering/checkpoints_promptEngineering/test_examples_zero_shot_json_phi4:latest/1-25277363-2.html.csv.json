    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"fast friend originally air on october 12 , 1993\" is true or false based on the given table, we need to evaluate specific details related to the title and its original air date.\n\n### Step-by-step Evaluation:\n\n1. **Identify the Title:**\n   - The claim mentions a title \"fast friend\". In our table, there's an entry with the title \"fast friends\" (note the slight difference in wording).\n\n2. **Verify the Original Air Date:**\n   - According to the claim, the original air date is October 12, 1993.\n   - We need to check if the row corresponding to \"fast friends\" has this date.\n\n3. **Locate Relevant Data in the Table:**\n   - The table is structured with rows representing entries and columns for attributes such as \"no in series\", \"no in season\", \"title\", \"directed by\", \"written by\", and \"original air date\".\n   - We focus on finding the row where the title matches \"fast friends\" and verify the original air date.\n\n4. **Check Row Data:**\n   - The entry for \"fast friends\" is at `row_index` 4 (considering zero-based indexing):\n     - Title: \"fast friends\"\n     - Original Air Date: October 12, 1993\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The title \"fast friends\" matches the claim's intended meaning of \"fast friend\", considering a common typo or simplification.\n   - The original air date of October 12, 1993, matches exactly as stated in the claim.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is supported by the data in the table.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down the relevant parts of the table and evaluate the claim step-by-step.\n\nThe claim states: \"the episode number in the series 'The Test' be before 148.0\". This means we need to verify two things:\n1. Identify the episode number (both season and series) for \"The Test\".\n2. Check if this series number is less than 148.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Episode Number for \"The Test\"\n- Look through the data in the table to find the row where the title is \"The Test\".\n- In the provided JSON:\n  - The row with `title` as \"The Test\" has a `no in series` of 159 and a `no in season` of 15.\n  - Relevant details from this row are:\n    ```json\n    [\n      159,\n      15,\n      \"the test\",\n      \"john tracy\",\n      \"dan chasin & linda lane\",\n      \"january 11 , 1994\"\n    ]\n    ```\n\n### Step 2: Compare with 148.0\n- The claim asks if the series number for \"The Test\" is before 148.\n- From the identified row, `no in series` (series episode number) for \"The Test\" is 159.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Since 159 is not less than 148, the condition specified in the claim (\"the episode number in the series 'The Test' be before 148.0\") is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant cells are those containing the `no in series` and the `title` for \"The Test\".\n- These details come from row index 14 (since indices start at 0).\n\nThus, the JSON response should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
