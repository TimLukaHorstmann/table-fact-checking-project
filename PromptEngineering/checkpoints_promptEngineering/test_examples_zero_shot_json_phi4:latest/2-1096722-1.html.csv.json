    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify each part of the claim against the data provided in the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"There be 10.6 million viewer for episode part four that have a run time of 24:57.\"\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n1. The viewers must be 10.6 million.\n2. The episode is \"part four.\"\n3. The run time must be \"24:57.\"\n\nNow, let's verify these conditions against the data:\n\n- **Row Index:** We need to find the row corresponding to \"episode part four.\" According to the table:\n  - Row index 0 corresponds to \"part one\"\n  - Row index 1 corresponds to \"part two\"\n  - Row index 2 corresponds to \"part three\"\n  - Row index 3 corresponds to \"part four\"\n\n- **Episode:** The row at index 3 has the episode name \"part four.\"\n\n- **Viewers (in millions):** For row index 3, the viewers are listed as 10.6.\n\n- **Run Time:** For row index 3, the run time is given as \"24:57.\"\n\nAll conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data in row index 3. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- Row index 3, column \"episode\"\n- Row index 3, column \"viewers (in millions)\"\n- Row index 3, column \"run time\"\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"viewers (in millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"run time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
