    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"when the computer has the feature of VLAN setting for Intel AMT network interface it does not have AMT 3.0,\" we need to analyze the relevant cells in the provided table.\n\nThe column names correspond to different versions and features associated with AMT (Active Management Technology). We'll look specifically at:\n\n1. **\"VLAN settings for Intel AMT Network Interfaces\"**: This feature is described across various columns.\n2. **\"AMT 3.0\"**: This version needs to be checked against the same rows where VLAN settings are present.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1. Identify the row corresponding to \"VLAN Settings for Intel AMT Network Interfaces\":\n   - From the table, this feature is listed in the column \"VLAN Settings for Intel AMT Network Interfaces.\"\n\n2. Check if \"AMT 3.0\" is available when VLAN settings are present:\n   - Locate the column named \"AMT 3.0.\"\n   - Compare each row where \"VLAN Settings for Intel AMT Network Interfaces\" has a \"yes,\" with the corresponding cell in the \"AMT 3.0\" column.\n\n**Relevant Rows and Columns:**\n\n- **Row Index:** The feature \"VLAN Settings for Intel AMT Network Interfaces\" appears as \"yes\" starting from row index 18.\n- **Column Name for VLAN Setting:** \"VLAN Settings for Intel AMT Network Interfaces\"\n- **Column Name for AMT 3.0:** \"AMT 3.0\"\n\n**Relevant Cell Analysis:**\n\n- **Row Index 18:**\n  - Column: \"VLAN Settings for Intel AMT Network Interfaces\" has \"yes.\"\n  - Column: \"AMT 3.0\" has \"no.\"\n\nSince VLAN settings are present and AMT 3.0 is absent in this row, the claim holds true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis confirms that whenever the feature of VLAN settings for Intel AMT network interfaces is available, AMT 3.0 is not. Hence, the claim is supported by the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"VLAN Settings for Intel AMT Network Interfaces\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"AMT 3.0\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
