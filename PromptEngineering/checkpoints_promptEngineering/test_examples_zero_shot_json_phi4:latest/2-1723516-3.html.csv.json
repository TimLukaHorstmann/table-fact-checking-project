    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if there exists a match in the given table with both the specified score of \"4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 3 - 6\" and the surface as \"clay\". Let's go through each data entry step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Score:**\n   - We will search for any row that has the \"score\" column containing the string \"4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 3 - 6\".\n\n2. **Check Surface Type:**\n   - Once we find a match with the specified score, we need to check if the corresponding \"surface\" column value is \"clay\".\n\nLet's examine each row in the data:\n\n- Row 0: Score is \"5 - 7 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 2\". Does not match.\n- Row 1: Score is \"4 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 1 - 6\". Does not match.\n- Row 2: Score is \"4 - 6 , 6 - 7\". Does not match.\n- **Row 3**: Score is \"1 - 6 , 5 - 7\". Does not match.\n- **Row 4**: Score is \"7 - 6 , 3 - 6 , 2 - 6\". Does not match.\n- Row 5: Score is \"6 - 1 , 7 - 6\". Does not match.\n- Row 6: Score is \"6 - 7 , 4 - 6\". Does not match.\n- **Row 7**: Score is \"4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 3 - 6\". This matches our score requirement. Now check the surface:\n  - Surface is \"clay\", which also matches our claim's requirement.\n\nSince row 7 meets both conditions (score of \"4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 3 - 6\" and surface \"clay\"), we can confirm that the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are in row 7, specifically from the columns \"score\" and \"surface\".\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
