    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim: \"651300 be after debt when cash on hand be 603490,\" we must examine the relevant data from the table provided.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that a value in the \"after debt\" column should equal 651,300 if the corresponding value in the \"cash on hand\" column is 603,490.\n   \n2. **Identifying Relevant Data Points**:\n   - We need to identify the row where the \"cash on hand\" value is 603,490.\n   - Once identified, we will check the corresponding value in the \"after debt\" column for that row.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Table**:\n   - The table has multiple rows of data, each representing a candidate with various financial metrics.\n   - We need to locate the row where \"cash on hand\" is 603,490.\n\n4. **Checking Each Row**:\n   - **Row 0 (Rudy Giuliani)**: \n     - Cash on Hand = 16,649,825\n     - After Debt = 16,480,569\n\n   - **Row 1 (Mitt Romney)**:\n     - Cash on Hand = 9,216,517\n     - After Debt = -8,133,483\n\n   - **Row 2 (Fred Thompson)**:\n     - Cash on Hand = 7,121,744\n     - After Debt = 6,443,312\n\n   - **Row 3 (Ron Paul)**:\n     - Cash on Hand = 5,443,667\n     - After Debt = 5,443,667\n\n   - **Row 4 (John McCain)**:\n     - Cash on Hand = 3,488,627\n     - After Debt = 1,758,936\n\n   - **Row 5 (Mike Huckabee)**:\n     - Cash on Hand = 651,300\n     - After Debt = 603,490\n\n   - **Row 6 (Duncan Hunter)**:\n     - Cash on Hand = 132,741\n     - After Debt = 82,741\n\n   - **Row 7 (Tom Tancredo)**:\n     - Cash on Hand = 110,079\n     - After Debt = -185,524\n\n   - **Row 8 (Sam Brownback)**:\n     - Cash on Hand = 94,653\n     - After Debt = 94,653\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - In Row 5, \"Mike Huckabee,\" the \"cash on hand\" is indeed 651,300 and the corresponding \"after debt\" value is 603,490.\n   - The claim states that if \"cash on hand be 603,490,\" then \"after debt be 651,300.\" However, in this row, when \"cash on hand\" is 651,300, \"after debt\" is 603,490. This is the reverse of what the claim states.\n\n6. **Final Answer**:\n   - The claim is FALSE because the conditions described are reversed in the data provided.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are from Row 5, specifically from the columns \"cash on hand\" and \"after debt.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"cash on hand\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"after debt\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
