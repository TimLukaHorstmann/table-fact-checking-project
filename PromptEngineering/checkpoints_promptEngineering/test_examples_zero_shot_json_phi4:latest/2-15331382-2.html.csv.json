This is confirmed by the entry: \n    ```json\n    [\n      14,\n      \"december 12 , 2004\",\n      \"tampa bay buccaneers\",\n      \"w 31 - 24\",\n      65858\n    ]\n    ```\n\n- Identify when the Chargers played the Cleveland Browns:\n  - From the table, we find that the Chargers played against the Cleveland Browns on December 19, 2004, in Week 15.

However, the attendance for this date (Row 12) is 77447.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since 77447 is not the lowest value, the claim is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - Row 11: Attendance = 46905\n   - Row 12: Attendance = 77447\n\nBased on this analysis, the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
