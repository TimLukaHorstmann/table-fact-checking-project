    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the table for relevant information about translators in Englewood, Illinois.\n\n### Understanding the Claim:\n- The claim states: \"Englewood, Illinois have 2 translator.\"\n- A \"translator\" typically refers to a type of radio station that retransmits broadcasts from another station. In this context, we are looking for stations with specific characteristics (such as frequency range or class) commonly associated with translators.\n- However, the table does not explicitly mention anything about \"translators.\" We need to infer based on available data.\n\n### Relevant Information in the Table:\n1. **City of License**: To find entries related to Englewood, Illinois.\n2. **Class**: Often, Class D stations can be low-power translators or boosters, but this is not a definitive indicator without additional context.\n3. **Frequency MHz**: Translators typically operate on different frequency ranges, often in the VHF and UHF bands.\n\n### Steps to Verify the Claim:\n1. **Identify Entries for Englewood, Illinois**:\n   - Look at the \"city of license\" column to find any entries with \"Englewood, Illinois.\"\n\n2. **Count Relevant Entries**:\n   - Check if there are 2 such entries that could be considered translators based on their class or other characteristics.\n\n### Examination of the Table:\n- The table data includes:\n  - Entry for Englewood, Illinois: \n    - Row index 1: \"w264bf\", frequency 100.7 MHz, city \"Englewood, Illinois\", ERP 2 W, class D, fcc info FCC.\n  \n- There is only one entry for Englewood, Illinois in the table.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The claim states there are 2 translators in Englewood, Illinois, but the table shows only one station from Englewood.\n- Without additional information explicitly identifying translators or a second entry for Englewood, we cannot support the claim of having 2 translators.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"city of license\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"class\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
