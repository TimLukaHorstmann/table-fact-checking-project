    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. The attendance for the game on November 21, 1993.\n2. Whether this attendance is indeed the lowest compared to all other games.\n\nLet's examine these steps with reference to the provided data:\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation\n\n#### Step 1: Identify Attendance for November 21, 1993\n- From the table, locate the row corresponding to \"November 21, 1993.\"\n- According to the given JSON:\n  - Date: November 21, 1993 (Row index 11)\n  - Attendance: 40,848\n\n#### Step 2: Compare Attendances\n- We need to compare this attendance figure with all other games in the table.\n- Extract the attendance values from each row and identify if any are lower than 40,848.\n\n### Relevant Data Extraction\nHere's a list of attendances extracted from each game along with their respective dates:\n\n1. September 5, 1993 - 44,120\n2. September 12, 1993 - 57,921\n3. September 26, 1993 - 61,746\n4. October 3, 1993 - 63,071\n5. October 10, 1993 - 54,215\n6. October 25, 1993 - 64,677\n7.

December 31, 1993 - 42,836\n\n### Conclusion on the Claim\n- The lowest attendance in the table is indeed 40,848 for November 21, 1993.\n- However, the claim states that this game had an attendance of \"only 55,527,\" which contradicts the correct figure (40,848).\n\nThus, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n- Row index 11 (\"November 21, 1993\") for attendance verification.\n- All rows need to be checked for comparison but specifically referencing attendance in row index 8 since it mentions 55,527 as per the incorrect claim detail.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The relevant information is in the \"result\" column for each game entry.\n\n1. **Identify Wins and Losses:**\n   - A win is indicated by a result starting with \"w\".\n   - A loss is indicated by a result starting with \"l\".\n\n2. **Count Wins and Losses from the Table:**\n\n   - Week 1, Date: September 5, 1993, Result: \"l 24 - 7\" (Loss)\n   - Week 2, Date: September 12, 1993, Result: \"w 10 - 7\" (Win)\n   - Week 4, Date: September 26, 1993, Result: \"w 15 - 13\" (Win)\n   - Week 5, Date: October 3, 1993, Result: \"l 38 - 19\" (Loss)\n   - Week 6, Date: October 10, 1993, Result: \"w 15 - 0\" (Win)\n   - Week 8, Date: October 25, 1993, Result: \"w 19 - 12\" (Win)\n   - Week 9, Date: October 31, 1993, Result: \"l 30 - 27\" (Loss)\n   - Week 10, Date: November 7, 1993, Result: \"l 30 - 17\" (Loss)\n   - Week 11, Date: November 14, 1993, Result: \"w 26 - 23\" (Win)\n   - Week 12, Date: November 21, 1993, Result: \"l 23 - 10\" (Loss)\n   - Week 13, Date: November 28, 1993, Result: \"l 17 - 14\" (Loss)\n   - Week 14, Date: December 5, 1993, Result: \"w 13 - 0\" (Win)\n   - Week 15, Date: December 12, 1993, Result: \"l 37 - 20\" (Loss)\n   - Week 16, Date: December 19, 1993, Result: \"w 21 - 17\" (Win)\n   - Week 17, Date: December 26, 1993, Result: \"w 30 - 10\" (Win)\n   - Week 18, Date: December 31, 1993, Result: \"w 14 - 9\" (Win)\n\n3. **Calculate Total Wins and Losses:**\n   - Wins: 8 games\n     - Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 14, 16, 17, 18\n   - Losses: 9 games\n     - Weeks 1, 5, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15\n\nThe claim states the team won 8 games and lost 6. Based on our analysis:\n- The team actually won 8 games.\n- The team lost 9 games.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because the number of losses is incorrect.\n\n4. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - All rows except Week 3 have relevant \"result\" data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
