We will compare each entry in this column against the claim that Paul Pierce achieved the highest score of 32 points in one game.\n\nLet's examine each row in the data section:\n\n1. **Row 0 (Game 76):** \"high points\" is \"paul pierce (32)\". This matches the claim.\n2. **Row 1 (Game 77):** \"high points\" is \"paul pierce (21)\". This does not exceed 32.\n3. **Row 2 (Game 78):** \"high points\" is \"rajon rondo (31)\".
