    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding Rafael M\u00e1rquez scoring more than one goal in international competition in the year 2000, we need to examine each entry in the data table for relevant information.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Goals Scored:** We need to check the \"goal\" column because it indicates which entries are goals scored by Rafael M\u00e1rquez.\n\n2. **Check Date:** For each goal, verify if it occurred in the year 2000 using the \"date\" column.\n\n3. **Determine Goal Count for 2000:** Count how many goals were scored in the year 2000 to see if more than one was scored.\n\n4. **Verify Other Years:** Ensure that no other year had Rafael M\u00e1rquez scoring more than one goal.\n\n### Analysis of Data:\n\n- **Row 1 (Goal: 1):** Date is \"5 February 1999\" \u2013 Not in the year 2000.\n  \n- **Row 2 (Goal: 2):** Date is \"13 February 2000\" \u2013 In the year 2000. This counts as one goal.\n\n- **Row 3 (Goal: 3):** Date is \"3 September 2000\" \u2013 In the year 2000. This adds up to two goals in 2000.\n\n- **Row 4 (Goal: 4):** Date is \"12 May 2002\" \u2013 Not in the year 2000.\n\n- **Row 5 (Goal: 5):** Date is \"24 July 2003\" \u2013 Not in the year 2000.\n\n- **Row 6 (Goal: 6):** Date is \"19 June 2004\" \u2013 Not in the year 2000.\n\n- **Row 7 (Goal: 7):** Date is \"7 September 2005\" \u2013 Not in the year 2000.\n\n- **Row 8 (Goal: 8):** Date is \"24 June 2006\" \u2013 Not in the year 2000.\n\n- **Row 9 (Goal: 9):** Date is \"28 March 2007\" \u2013 Not in the year 2000.\n\n- **Row 10 (Goal: 10):** Date is \"10 September 2008\" \u2013 Not in the year 2000.\n\n- **Row 11 (Goal: 11):** Date is \"11 June 2010\" \u2013 Not in the year 2000.\n\n- **Row 12 (Goal: 12):** Date is \"12 June 2011\" \u2013 Not in the year 2000.\n\n- **Row 13 (Goal: 13):** Date is \"30 October 2013\" \u2013 Not in the year 2000.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nIn 2000, Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored two goals (in rows 2 and 3), confirming that he did score more than one goal.

Rafael M\u00e1rquez did not score during the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\nLet's examine each part using the table:\n\n### Part 1: Scoring in 2006\n\n- Look for entries where the \"competition\" is related to an event in 2006.\n- The relevant entry is:\n  - Row index 7: \n    - \"goal\": 8\n    - \"date\": \"24 June 2006\"\n    - \"score\": \"1 - 0\"\n    - \"result\": \"1 - 2 (aet)\"\n    - \"competition\": \"2006 FIFA World Cup\"\n\nThis entry confirms that Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\n\n### Part 2: Not Scoring in 2010\n\n- Look for entries where the \"competition\" is related to an event in 2010.\n- The relevant entry is:\n  - Row index 10:\n    - \"goal\": 11\n    - \"date\": \"11 June 2010\"\n    - \"score\": \"1 - 1\"\n    - \"result\": \"1 - 1\"\n    - \"competition\": \"2010 FIFA World Cup\"\n\nThis entry shows that Rafael M\u00e1rquez did not score a goal during the 2010 FIFA World Cup, as the \"goal\" column for this match is listed as 11, indicating it was the eleventh goal he scored in total, and there's no indication of him scoring specifically in this match.\n\nBased on these checks:\n\n- The first part of the claim is true because Rafael M\u00e1rquez did score during the 2006 event.\n- The second part of the claim is also true because he remained scoreless during the 2010 FIFA World Cup match listed.\n\nThus, both conditions are met. The relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n\n- For scoring in 2006: Row index 7 (columns \"goal\", \"date\", \"competition\").\n- For not scoring in 2010: Row index 10 (columns \"goal\", \"date\", \"competition\").\n\nThe JSON object with the answer and relevant cells is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze if Rafael M\u00e1rquez had any international match in which he did not score during the years 2001, 2009, and 2012.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Extract Relevant Data:** \n   - We need to identify matches from the given table that fall within the years 2001, 2009, and 2012.\n   - The relevant column for determining if M\u00e1rquez scored is \"score\", as it indicates his contribution in a match.\n\n2. **Analyze Year 2001:**\n   - Check all rows to find matches dated between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2001.\n   - From the data provided:\n     - No matches are listed for the year 2001.\n\n3. **Analyze Year 2009:**\n   - Check all rows to find matches dated between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2009.\n   - From the data provided:\n     - No matches are listed for the year 2009.\n\n4. **Analyze Year 2012:**\n   - Check all rows to find matches dated between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2012.\n   - From the data provided:\n     - No matches are listed for the year 2012.\n\n5. **Conclusion on the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that M\u00e1rquez did not remain scoreless in international competition in these years.\n   - Since there are no matches recorded for him during 2001, 2009, and 2012, it is impossible for him to have remained scoreless because he did not play any match at all. Thus, the claim holds true by default.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- There are no specific rows relevant for these years since there are no matches in those years. However, examining the entire dataset ensures completeness of this analysis.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
