    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Roger Vadim directed 'La Ronde' in 1966\" is true or false according to the provided table, we need to verify specific details:\n\n1. **Director Verification**: Check if Roger Vadim is listed as the director of a film titled \"La Ronde\".\n2. **Year Verification**: Confirm that this film was associated with the year 1965, not 1966.\n3. **Title Verification**: Ensure the title matches exactly as \"La Ronde\".\n\nLet's examine the relevant entries in the table:\n\n- The entry corresponding to Roger Vadim and \"La Ronde\" is found:\n  - Row Index: 2\n  - Year: 1965 (not 1966)\n  - English Title: Circle of Love (though \"La Ronde\" is listed as the original title, matching our verification requirement for title)\n  - Original Title: La Ronde\n  - Director: Roger Vadim\n\nFrom this examination:\n- The director matches: Roger Vadim.\n- The film title in its original form (\"La Ronde\") matches.\n- However, the year provided is 1965, not 1966 as claimed.\n\nTherefore, based on these findings, the claim \"Roger Vadim directed 'La Ronde' in 1966\" is FALSE because the correct year associated with this film and director is 1965.\n\nHere are the relevant cells to support this conclusion:\n\n- Row Index: 2, Column Name: \"year\"\n- Row Index: 2, Column Name: \"original title\"\n- Row Index: 2, Column Name: \"director\"\n\nThus, the JSON output is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"original title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"director\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
