The data lacks sufficient detail on contestant identities and their sequence of performances.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince there is no evidence in the table that allows us to confirm or deny the claim specifically about Didi Benami's last song choice being \"no one\", we cannot validate this claim with certainty from the provided information.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n- **Explanation**: \n  - The row index 2 is relevant because it contains the song \"no one\".\n  - The result column in this context helps confirm the performance was advanced but does not contribute to verifying if it was Didi Benami's last performance.\n  - Ultimately, the lack of contestant-specific data makes the claim unverifiable as true.",

Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's provide the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"theme\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
