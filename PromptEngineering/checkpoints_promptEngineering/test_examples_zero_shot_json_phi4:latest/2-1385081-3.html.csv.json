The relevant information can be found under two columns: \"score\" and \"competition.\" We will focus on these columns for each row where Cho Jae-jin's score is mentioned.\n\nLet's examine each entry:\n\n1. **Row 0:** \n   - Date: 25 September 2003\n   - Venue: Incheon\n   - Score: 1 goal\n   - Result: 5 - 0\n   - Competition: 2004 AFC Asian Cup Qualification\n\n2. **Row 1:**\n   - Date: 24 October 2003\n   - Venue: Muscat\n   - Score: 1 goal\n   - Result: 7 - 0\n   - Competition: 2004 AFC Asian Cup Qualification\n\n3. **Row 2:**\n   - Date: 19 December 2004\n   - Venue: Busan\n   - Score: 1 goal\n   - Result: 3 - 1\n   - Competition: Friendly match\n\n4. **Row 3:**\n   - Date: 1 February 2006\n   - Venue: Hong Kong\n   - Score: 1 goal\n   - Result: 1 - 3\n   - Competition: 2006 Carlsberg Cup\n\n5. **Row 4:**\n   - Date: 26 May 2006\n   - Venue: Seoul\n   - Score: 1 goal\n   - Result: 2 - 0\n   - Competition: Friendly match\n\n6. **Row 5:**\n   - Date: 6 September 2006\n   - Venue: Suwon\n   - Score: 2 goals\n   - Result: 8 - 0\n   - Competition: 2007 AFC Asian Cup Qualification\n\n7. **Row 6:**\n   - Date: 11 October 2006\n   - Venue: Seoul\n   - Score: 1 goal\n   - Result: 2 - 1\n   - Competition: 2007 AFC Asian Cup Qualification\n\n8. **Row 7:**\n   - Date: 5 July 2007\n   - Venue: Seoul\n   - Score: 2 goals\n   - Result: 2 - 1\n   - Competition: Friendly match\n\nNow, let's sum up the goals scored by Cho Jae-jin:\n\n- Row 0: 1 goal\n- Row 1: 1 goal\n- Row 2: 1 goal\n- Row 3: 1 goal\n- Row 4: 1 goal\n- Row 5: 2 goals\n- Row 6: 1 goal\n- Row 7: 2 goals\n\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 10 goals\n\nThe claim states that Cho Jae-jin scored a total of 15 goals.
