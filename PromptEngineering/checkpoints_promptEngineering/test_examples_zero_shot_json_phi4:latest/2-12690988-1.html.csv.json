    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim \"goal for friendly competition be less than 3,\" we need to analyze the table and check for entries where both the number of goals (\"goal\" column) is associated with a \"friendly\" competition (from the \"competition\" column), and see if those goals are less than 3.\n\nHere's how we can break down the verification process:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: \n   - The columns relevant to our claim are \"goal\" and \"competition.\"\n\n2. **Check Each Row for the Condition**:\n   - We need to find rows where the competition type is \"friendly.\"\n   - For these rows, we then check if the number of goals (\"goal\") is less than 3.\n\n3. **Analyze Rows**:\n   - **Row 0**: \n     - Goal: 1\n     - Competition: Friendly\n     - Since 1 < 3, this row supports the claim.\n   - **Row 1**:\n     - Goal: 2\n     - Competition: Friendly\n     - Since 2 < 3, this row also supports the claim.\n   - **Row 2**: \n     - Goal: 3\n     - Competition: 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica (not friendly)\n     - This does not meet our condition as it's not a \"friendly\" competition.\n   - **Row 3**:\n     - Goal: 4\n     - Competition: Friendly\n     - Since 4 is not less than 3, this row does not support the claim.\n   - **Row 4**: \n     - Goal: 5\n     - Competition: 2014 World Cup qualifier (not friendly)\n     - This row does not meet our condition as it's not a \"friendly\" competition.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is only supported by rows where both conditions are met, which in this case are Row 0 and Row 1.\n   - However, since there exists at least one instance (Row 3) where the goal for a friendly match is not less than 3, the overall claim does not hold true.\n\nBased on this analysis, we conclude that the claim \"goal for friendly competition be less than 3\" is FALSE.
