    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim \"there be no home team that score more than 11,\" we need to examine each entry in the \"home team score\" column of the provided data table and compare those scores against the number 11.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what needs to be checked:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - The relevant column for this claim is \"home team score.\"\n\n2. **Examine Each Entry:**\n   - We need to extract the numeric part from each home team score entry and compare it to 11.\n\n3. **Score Extraction and Comparison:**\n   - For each row, convert the string in the format \"X.YZ\" into a numeric value where X represents the number of whole scores (goals) and YZ represents additional points.\n   - Calculate the total score using the conversion that 1 goal = 6 points, i.e., `total_score = X * 6 + Y`.\n   - Check if any total score exceeds 11.\n\n4. **Verification Process:**\n   - Iterate over each row in the data and perform the above calculation:\n     - Row 0: \"11.23\" -> \\(11 \\times 6 + 2 = 68\\)\n     - Row 1: \"16.12\" -> \\(16 \\times 6 + 1 = 97\\)\n     - Row 2: \"14.12\" -> \\(14 \\times 6 + 1 = 85\\)\n     - Row 3: \"15.14\" -> \\(15 \\times 6 + 1 = 91\\)\n     - Row 4: \"13.9\" -> \\(13 \\times 6 + 0 = 78\\)\n     - Row 5: \"11.5\" -> \\(11 \\times 6 + 0 = 66\\)\n\n5. **Determine Claim Validity:**\n   - The claim is that no home team scored more than 11 goals.\n   - However, all the calculated scores (68, 97, 85, 91, 78, and 66) are based on conversions where the number of goals (X) itself in each case exceeds 11.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since every home team score involves more than 11 goals, the claim is false.\n\n7. **Relevant Cells Identification:**\n   - All rows contain relevant information as they all have a \"home team score\" greater than 11 when converted into total points.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
