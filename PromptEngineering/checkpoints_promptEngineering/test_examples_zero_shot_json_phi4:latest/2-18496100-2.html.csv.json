    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim \"datia's constituency number be lower than gohad's by 10\", we need to extract and compare relevant information from the provided table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - The row containing \"gohad\" will give us the constituency number for Gohad.\n   - The rows containing constituencies in Datia (i.e., Sewda, Bhander, and Datia itself) will help identify the lowest constituency number in Datia.\n\n2. **Extract Constituency Numbers:**\n   - For \"gohad\" (row 4), the constituency number is 13.\n   - In Datia, we have:\n     - Sewda with constituency number 20 (row 5)\n     - Bhander with constituency number 21 (row 6)\n     - Datia itself with constituency number 22 (row 7)\n\n3. **Determine Lowest Constituency Number in Datia:**\n   - The lowest constituency number in Datia is 20 (Sewda).\n\n4. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - Gohad's constituency number is 13.\n   - Sewda's constituency number, which is the lowest for Datia, is 20.\n   - The difference between Sewda and Gohad is \\(20 - 13 = 7\\), not 10.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE. \n\nRelevant cells are:\n- For \"gohad\": Row 4, Column \"constituency number\"\n- For \"Sewda\" (lowest in Datia): Row 5, Column \"constituency number\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"constituency number\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"constituency number\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
