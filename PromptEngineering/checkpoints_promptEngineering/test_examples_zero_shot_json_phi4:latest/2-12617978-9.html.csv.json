Confirm that Jerry Mantalvanos & Paul Merker requested a specific amount of money in episode 7.\n2. Ensure that no other company or entrepreneur requested more than this amount in any episode.\n\nFirstly, let's identify where Jerry Mantalvanos & Paul Merker appear in the dataset:\n- They are listed under \"episode 7,\" with the company/product name as \"jpm eco logistics\" and a request of 100000.\n\nNow, we need to verify if 145000 is indeed the highest amount requested by anyone else. We'll check all entries for the \"money requested\" column:\n\n1. Episode 1:\n   - Celia Norowzian & Ian Forshew: 50000\n   - Laban Roomes: 60000\n\n2. Episode 2:\n   - Sarah Lu: 35000\n   - Emmie Matthews & Ed Stevens: 200000 (This is higher than the amount requested by Jerry Mantalvanos & Paul Merker)\n\n3.
