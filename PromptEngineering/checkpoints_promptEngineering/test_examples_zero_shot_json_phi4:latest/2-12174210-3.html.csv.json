    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Lynmore Primary School having a coed student body is true or false based on the provided table, we need to focus on specific columns related to school names and their gender composition.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**:\n   - We first look for \"Lynmore Primary School\" in the \"name\" column to identify its row index.\n   \n2. **Verify Claimed Conditions**:\n   - Once the correct row is found, we check the \"gender\" column to confirm whether it indicates a coed (coeducational) student body.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n- **Finding Lynmore Primary School**: \n  - Scan through each row's name until we find \"Lynmore Primary School\". This appears in row index `22`.\n\n- **Check Gender Composition**:\n  - In row `22`, the value under the \"gender\" column is \"coed\", which means it has a coeducational student body.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim \"the lynmore primary school have a coed student body\" matches exactly with the information in the table. Therefore, the answer is TRUE. \n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cells needed to verify this claim are:\n  - Row index `22`, Column name \"name\" (to find Lynmore Primary School).\n  - Row index `22`, Column name \"gender\" (to confirm coed).\n\nHere's the final JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"gender\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about Lynmore Primary School, we need to verify two specific conditions from the data provided in the table: \n\n1. The school's name must be \"Lynmore Primary School.\"\n2. The range of years (from column \"years\") for which it admits coed students should include 1 through 8.\n\nLet\u2019s identify and examine the relevant parts of the table:\n\n- We need to find the row where the school's name is \"Lynmore Primary School.\"\n- Once located, we'll check the \"name\" column to confirm the school name.\n- Next, we will verify the \"years\" column to see if it includes years 1 through 8.\n- Additionally, we must ensure that the \"gender\" column indicates that students are coed.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. **Finding Lynmore Primary School**:\n   - We locate \"Lynmore Primary School\" in the table at row index 21.\n\n2. **Checking Relevant Details**:\n   - In row 21, under the \"name\" column, we confirm that it reads \"Lynmore Primary School.\"\n   - Under the \"years\" column for this school, we see the range is \"1 - 6,\" not \"1 - 8.\"\n   - The \"gender\" column states \"coed,\" which matches part of our claim.\n\nFrom these observations, the primary issue is that Lynmore Primary School admits students only up to year 6, not through year 8 as claimed. \n\nThus, based on the verification process and the data provided in the table, we conclude that the claim is false.\n\nHere's the JSON response reflecting this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"gender\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
