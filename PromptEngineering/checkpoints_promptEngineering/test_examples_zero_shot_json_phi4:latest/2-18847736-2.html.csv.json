This corresponds to row index 4.\n\n- **Compare Attendances**:\n  - We need to check each entry in the \"attendance\" column across all games listed.\n  - Identify if any other game's attendance is greater than 51,496.\n\nHere's a detailed analysis of relevant entries:\n\n- Row 0: September 2 vs Buffalo Bills - Attendance: 69,441\n- Row 1: September 9 vs Seattle Seahawks - Attendance: 56,233\n- Row 4: September 30 vs New York Jets - Attendance: 51,496 (Claimed game)\n- Row 11: November 18 vs Cleveland Browns - Attendance: 80,374\n\nFrom this analysis:\n\n- The highest attendance recorded is for the November 18 game against the Cleveland Browns with an attendance of 80,374.\n- Therefore, the September 30 game between Miami Dolphins and New York Jets does not have the highest attendance.\n\nThus, the claim that \"the game between the miami dolphin and new york jet on september 30 have the highest attendance of the season\" is FALSE. The relevant cells for verifying this are:\n\n1. Row index 4: Attendance column (for September 30 game).\n2. Additional rows where attendance surpasses 51,496:\n   - Row index 0: Attendance column.\n   - Row index 11: Attendance column.\n\nThe final JSON response would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the specific data points in the table relevant to the comparison of scores between two games involving the Baltimore Colts and the Miami Dolphins.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"Baltimore Colt score more on Nov 11 against the Miami Dolphins than on Nov 25.\"\n\n#### Steps to Evaluate the Claim:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - Look for entries where the opponent is \"baltimore colts\".\n   - Specifically, find the games played on \"nov 11\" and \"nov 25\".\n\n2. **Extract Scores:**\n   - For each identified game, extract the scores:\n     - \"dolphins points\": This column represents the points scored by the Miami Dolphins.\n     - \"opponents\": This column represents the points scored by the opponents (Baltimore Colts in this case).\n\n3. **Compare Scores:**\n   - Compare the Dolphins' score on Nov 11 with their score on Nov 25.\n\n#### Relevant Data Extraction:\n\n- **Nov 11 Game:**\n  - Row Index: 10\n  - \"dolphins points\": 19\n  - \"opponents\" (Baltimore Colts): 0\n\n- **Nov 25 Game:**\n  - Row Index: 12\n  - \"dolphins points\": 24\n  - \"opponents\" (Baltimore Colts): 30\n\n#### Comparison:\n\n- On Nov 11, the Dolphins scored 19 points against the Baltimore Colts.\n- On Nov 25, the Dolphins scored 24 points against the Baltimore Colts.\n\nSince 19 (Nov 11) is less than 24 (Nov 25), the claim that the Baltimore Colts scored more on Nov 11 than on Nov 25 is FALSE because it implies the opposite of what actually happened: the Dolphins scored more on Nov 25.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE. The relevant cells for verifying this are those containing the \"dolphins points\" and \"opponents\" scores for the games on Nov 11 and Nov 25.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"dolphins points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"dolphins points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
