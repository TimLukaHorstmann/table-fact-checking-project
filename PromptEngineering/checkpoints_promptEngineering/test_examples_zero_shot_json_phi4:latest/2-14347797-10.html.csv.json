    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify whether the opponent on April 14 is indeed the New Jersey Devils. Let's evaluate this step-by-step based on the provided table:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - We are interested in finding information related to \"April 14.\" \n   - The rows of data represent games, with each row including a date, opponent, and other details.\n   - Thus, we need to locate the row where the \"date\" column is \"april 14.\"\n\n2. **Examine the Data:**\n   - Row indices in the table are as follows:\n     - Row 0: April 8\n     - Row 1: April 10\n     - Row 2: April 12\n     - Row 3: April 14 (matches our date of interest)\n     - Row 4: April 17\n\n3. **Check the Opponent for the Relevant Date:**\n   - For row index 3, where \"date\" is \"april 14,\" check the \"opponent\" column.\n   - The value in the \"opponent\" column at row index 3 is \"new jersey devils.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the opponent listed for April 14 matches \"New Jersey Devils,\" the claim that \"the opponent for april 14 be the new jersey devil\" is TRUE.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells to verify this claim are those containing the date and opponent information:\n     - Row index 3, column name \"date\"\n     - Row index 3, column name \"opponent\"\n\nThe JSON object reflecting these findings would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
