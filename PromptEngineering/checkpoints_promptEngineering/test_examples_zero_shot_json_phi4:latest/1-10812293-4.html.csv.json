    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about T.J. Ford's performance on December 23, we need to carefully examine the table data for the relevant game and check if he was indeed the highest scorer with 24 points.\n\n1. **Identify the Game**: The claim pertains to a specific date: \"December 23.\" We locate this entry in the \"data\" section of the JSON structure.\n   \n2. **Verify the Date**: From the data, we find:\n   - Row index 12 corresponds to December 23.\n\n3. **Check the Claimed Statistics**:\n   - The claim states that T.J. Ford was the highest scorer with 24 points. We need to check two columns for this entry:\n     - \"high points\" (to verify if T.J. Ford scored 24 points).\n     - The same column can confirm if he was indeed the highest scorer.\n\n4. **Analyze Relevant Data**:\n   - In row index 12, under the \"high points\" column, it is listed as: \"t j ford (24)\".\n   - This confirms that T.J. Ford scored 24 points and was the highest scorer for this game.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: All conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data in the table.\n\nBased on these steps, the answer to the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the relevant information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the game on December 20, we need to examine the relevant data from the table provided in JSON format.\n\nThe claim is: \"for game on december 20 , the high point get more than 25.\"\n\nLet's break down the necessary steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row**: \n   - We are interested in the game that took place on December 20. This corresponds to row index 11 (as indexing starts from 0).\n\n2. **Locate the \"high points\" Column**:\n   - The column named \"high points\" contains the data regarding the player with the highest points scored in each game.\n\n3. **Extract and Analyze the Data**:\n   - For the December 20 game, look at the value under the \"high points\" column for row index 11.\n   - According to the table:\n     ```\n     [\n       26,\n       \"december 20\",\n       \"la clippers\",\n       \"w 98 - 96 (ot)\",\n       \"fred jones (23)\", \n       \"andrea bargnani , radoslav nesterovi\\u0107 (7)\",\n       \"t j ford (9)\",\n       \"staples center 17962\",\n       \"11 - 15\"\n     ]\n     ```\n   - The value for \"high points\" is \"fred jones (23)\".\n\n4. **Compare Against the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the high point scorer got more than 25 points.\n   - Fred Jones scored 23 points, which is not greater than 25.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since Fred Jones's score of 23 does not exceed 25, the claim is FALSE.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells for this verification are located at row index 11 and in the \"high points\" column.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, here is the JSON object that represents the conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
