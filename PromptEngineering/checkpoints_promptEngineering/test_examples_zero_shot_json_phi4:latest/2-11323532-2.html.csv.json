In this case, it is at `row_index 10`.\n\n2. **Verify Language**:\n   - Check the \"languages\" column for the entry at `row_index 10`.\n   - The value in this cell is `\"hebrew\"`, which matches the claim.\n\n3. **Verify Status**:\n   - Check the \"status\" column for the entry at `row_index 10`.\n   - The value in this cell is `\"discontinued\"`, which contradicts the claim that it should be \"ongoing\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Since the status does not match the requirement of being \"ongoing\", the entire claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells to verify the claim are those pertaining to the language and status for Israel.
