The specific claim states that the \"Manchester United vs Manchester City game has the highest attendance of all games.\" Here\u2019s how we can verify this:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant row**: \n   - We look for the row where the home team is \"manchester united\" and the away team is \"manchester city\". This corresponds to tie number 6 in the table.\n\n2. **Extract attendance for this game**:\n   - The attendance for the Manchester United vs Manchester City game (tie no. 6) is 67228.\n\n3. **Compare with other games**:\n   - We need to check the attendance figures for all other games to see if any have a higher number than 67228.\n   - For tie no. 1, the attendance is 34669.\n   - For the replay of tie no. 1, the attendance is 19529.\n   - For tie no. 2, the attendance is 24966.\n   - For the replay of tie no. 2, the attendance is 25645.\n   - For tie no. 3, the attendance is 17074.\n   - For tie no. 4, the attendance is 12215.\n   - For tie no. 5, the attendance is 14705.\n   - For the replay of tie no. 5, the attendance is 27934.\n   - For tie no. 7, the attendance is 10420.\n   - For tie no. 8, the attendance is 38136.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The highest attendance among all listed games and replays is indeed for the Manchester United vs Manchester City game (tie no. 6) with an attendance of 67228.\n\n5. **Relevant cells**:\n   - We need to consider both the tie number row (to identify it as the specific match in question) and the attendance value for this game.\n   - For tie no. 6, relevant columns are \"tie no\" and \"attendance\".\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The \"tie no\" column indicates the match number.\n2. The \"attendance\" column provides the number of attendees for each game.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Extract Attendance Data**: We look at the 'attendance' values associated with each tie no and replay entry.\n   - Tie 1: Liverpool vs Portsmouth has an attendance of 34,669.\n   - Replay: Portsmouth vs Liverpool has an attendance of 19,529.\n   - Tie 2: Sunderland vs Birmingham City has an attendance of 24,966.\n   - Replay: Birmingham City vs Sunderland has an attendance of 25,645.\n   - Tie 3: Sheffield United vs Colchester United has an attendance of 17,074.\n   - Tie 4: Tranmere Rovers vs Swansea City has an attendance of 12,215.\n   - Tie 5: Fulham vs West Ham United has an attendance of 14,705.\n   - Replay: West Ham United vs Fulham has an attendance of 27,934.\n   - Tie 6: Manchester United vs Manchester City has an attendance of 67,228.\n   - Tie 7: Millwall vs Burnley has an attendance of 10,420.\n   - Tie 8: Arsenal vs Chelsea has an attendance of 38,136.\n\n2. **Compare Attendance Figures**: We compare all the extracted attendance figures to find the highest one:\n   - Highest attendance is for tie no 6 (Manchester United vs Manchester City) with 67,228 attendees.\n\n3. **Evaluate Claim**: The claim states that \"tie no 7 have the highest attendance out of all feature game.\" However, as calculated above, tie no 7 (Millwall vs Burnley) has an attendance of only 10,420, which is not the highest.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.
