The team played in the \"division semifinals\".\n2. This occurred when the team was part of the \"western\" division.\n\nLet\u2019s examine the relevant columns from the table:\n- \"division\": Check for \"western\"\n- \"playoffs\": Look for \"division semifinals\"\n\nNow, let's go through each row to find any matching condition:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Division is \"western\", Playoffs is \"did not qualify\" (not a match)\n2. **Row 1**: Division is \"western\", Playoffs is \"1st round\" (not a match)\n3. **Row 2**: Division is \"western\", Playoffs is \"1st round\" (not a match)\n4. **Row 3**: Division is \"western\", Playoffs is \"quarterfinals\" (not a match)\n5. **Row 4**: Division is \"western\", Playoffs is \"did not qualify\" (not a match)\n6. **Row 5**: Division is \"western\", Playoffs is \"division semifinals\" (match found)\n7. **Row 6**: Division is \"western\", Playoffs is \"division finals\" (not a match for semifinals)\n8. **Row 7**: Division is \"n/a\", irrelevant since division is not \"western\"\n9. **Row 8**: Division is \"eastern\", irrelevant since division is not \"western\"\n\nThe condition matches in Row 5 where the team was indeed part of the \"western\" division and reached the \"division semifinals\".

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"the western division be the only division list in the table\" is true or false, we need to examine the data provided in the table and specifically look at the \"division\" column for each row.\n\n1. **Identify the 'Division' Column**: The relevant information will come from examining the values listed under the \"division\" column.\n\n2. **Check Each Row**:\n   - **Row 0 (1981 / 82)**: Division is \"western\".\n   - **Row 1 (1982 / 83)**: Division is \"western\".\n   - **Row 2 (1983 / 84)**: Division is \"western\".\n   - **Row 3 (1984 / 85)**: Division is \"western\".\n   - **Row 4 (1985 / 86)**: Division is \"western\".\n   - **Row 5 (1986 / 87)**: Division is \"western\".\n   - **Row 6 (1987 / 88)**: Division is \"western\".\n   - **Row 7 (1988 / 89)**: Division is \"n / a\". This entry does not list any division, but it isn't the \"eastern\" division.\n   - **Row 8 (1989 / 90)**: Division is \"eastern\".\n\n3. **Analyze the Data**:\n   - The table includes entries for both \"western\" and \"eastern\" divisions, as well as an entry where the division is not applicable (\"n/a\").\n   - Specifically, Row 8 clearly indicates that there is a record for the \"eastern\" division.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since there exists at least one row (Row 8) with the \"eastern\" division, the claim that \"the western division be the only division list in the table\" is false.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - Row index 8, column name \"division\" is relevant because it shows the presence of an \"eastern\" division.\n   - Additionally, all rows with the \"western\" division are relevant for context to confirm its frequency but are not necessary to disprove the claim.\n\nTherefore, the JSON output should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"division\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
