    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the table data, we will assess each part of the claim against the relevant cells in the provided table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **Year**: The claim states \"in 1999\". We need to identify if there is a row with the year 1999.\n2. **Runners-Up**: The claim mentions \"santiago luna miguel angel martin be the runner up behind tiger wood\". This means we must find whether Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin are listed as runners-up for the year 1999, in association with Tiger Woods.\n\n### Table Analysis:\nThe table is structured with columns: \n- `year`\n- `country`\n- `team`\n- `individual`\n- `location`\n- `runners - up`\n\nWe'll look at each row to find the year 1999 and check if it matches the claim details.\n\n1. **Row 0**:\n   - `year`: 1999\n   - `team`: \"mark o'meara & tiger woods\"\n   - `individual`: \"tiger woods\"\n   - `runners - up`: \"santiago luna & miguel angel martin\"\n\nThis row matches the year 1999, and it also has Tiger Woods as part of both team and individual entries. The runners-up are indeed Santiago Luna & Miguel Angel Martin.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll parts of the claim align with the data in Row 0 for the year 1999. Therefore, the claim is supported by the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"individual\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"runners - up\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, \"the tournament was first held in Cape Town in 1996,\" we need to check for two conditions:\n\n1. The location of the event being Cape Town.\n2. Whether this was the first occurrence of the tournament in Cape Town.\n\nLet's verify these points using the provided JSON data table:\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation\n\n#### Step 1: Check for the Location \"Cape Town\"\n\nWe need to identify which rows (years) have \"Cape Town\" as their location. From the data, we find:\n\n- Row index 4 has \"location\": \"cape town , south africa\".\n\nThis confirms that Cape Town was indeed a host city in 1996.\n\n#### Step 2: Check if it's the First Occurrence\n\nTo determine if 1996 was the first occurrence of the tournament being held in Cape Town, we need to ensure there are no prior years listed with \"cape town\" as their location. We review all rows for any previous occurrences:\n\n- Row index 0: Location is \"kuala lumpur , malaysia\".\n- Row index 1: Location is \"auckland , new zealand\".\n- Row index 2: Location is \"kiawah island , south carolina , usa\".\n- Row index 3: Location is \"cape town , south africa\". (1996)\n- Row indices 4 and 5 have different locations.\n\nNone of the years before 1996 had Cape Town as their location. Therefore, 1996 was indeed the first occurrence.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied:\n\n1. The tournament was held in Cape Town in 1996.\n2. It was the first time it was held there.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere is the JSON response with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe first relevant cell (index 3) confirms the location in 1996. The second relevant cell (index 4) checks that no previous years have Cape Town as a location, ensuring it's the first occurrence.",
