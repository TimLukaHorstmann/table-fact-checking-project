The claim is: \"the team lose on nov 25 against the cincinnati bengal.\"\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: \n   - We need to check the columns \"date\", \"opponent\", and \"result\" because they provide information about when a game occurred, who the opponent was, and whether it was a win or loss.\n\n2. **Locate Specific Date in Table**:\n   - The claim specifies the date as \"nov 25\". We will look for this date in the table to find the relevant row.\n\n3. **Verify Opponent Name**: \n   - Once we have identified the row with \"nov 25\", we need to check if the opponent listed is \"cincinnati bengals\".\n\n4. **Check Result of Game**:\n   - Finally, we must verify that the result for this game is a \"loss\".\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n- The table data shows a row where:\n  - \"date\" is \"nov 25\".\n  - \"opponent\" is \"cincinnati bengals\".\n  - \"result\" is \"loss\".\n\nThis matches all parts of the claim. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Row index 12 (since the first row in a typical zero-indexed array corresponds to the second game).\n- Column names are \"date\", \"opponent\", and \"result\".\n\nThus, the JSON object reflecting our findings would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
