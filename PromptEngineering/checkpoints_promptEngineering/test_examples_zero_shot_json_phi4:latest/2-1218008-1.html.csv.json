    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding the game on October 16 being the only game longer than 3 minutes in the 1982 World Series, we need to analyze relevant data from the table. The primary aspect mentioned is the duration of each game.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - We are concerned with the \"time\" column because it indicates how long each game lasted.\n   - Each entry in this column represents the duration in hours and minutes, e.g., \"2:54\" implies a 2 hour and 54 minute duration.\n\n2. **Convert Time to Total Minutes**:\n   - Convert all time entries into total minutes for comparison.\n   - Formula: Total Minutes = (Hours \u00d7 60) + Minutes\n\n3. **Calculate Total Duration for Each Game**:\n   - For each game, convert the time into minutes as follows:\n     - October 12: \"2:30\" \u2192 (2 \u00d7 60) + 30 = 150 minutes\n     - October 13: \"2:54\" \u2192 (2 \u00d7 60) + 54 = 174 minutes\n     - October 15: \"2:53\" \u2192 (2 \u00d7 60) + 53 = 173 minutes\n     - **October 16**: \"3:04\" \u2192 (3 \u00d7 60) + 4 = 184 minutes\n     - October 17: \"3:02\" \u2192 (3 \u00d7 60) + 2 = 182 minutes\n     - October 19: \"2:21\" \u2192 (2 \u00d7 60) + 21 = 141 minutes\n     - October 20: \"2:50\" \u2192 (2 \u00d7 60) + 50 = 170 minutes\n\n4. **Compare Durations**:\n   - We need to determine which games lasted more than 180 minutes (3 hours).\n   - From the calculations above, we observe:\n     - Game on October 16: 184 minutes\n     - Game on October 17: 182 minutes\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the game on October 16 was the only game longer than 3 minutes.\n   - However, we found another game (October 17) with a duration of 182 minutes which also exceeds 180 minutes.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false because there are two games lasting more than 3 hours: the games on October 16 and October 17. Thus, the relevant cells for determining the truthfulness of this claim are those under the \"time\" column corresponding to these dates.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two main points from the table:\n\n1. **Games played by Milwaukee Brewers at County Stadium**: Identify which games were played at \"County Stadium\" and determine if they were won by the Milwaukee Brewers.\n2. **The context of the 1982 World Series**: The claim specifies that this should be in the context of the 1982 World Series.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- The table provides data for seven games, with relevant columns being \"game\", \"date\", \"score\", and \"location\".\n- We need to focus on games played at \"County Stadium\" by Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nFrom the data:\n- **Game 3**: Location is \"county stadium\". Score: \"st louis cardinals - 6 , milwaukee brewers - 2\". The Brewers lost.\n- **Game 4**: Location is \"county stadium\". Score: \"st louis cardinals - 5 , milwaukee brewers - 7\". The Brewers won.\n- **Game 5**: Location is \"county stadium\". Score: \"st louis cardinals - 4 , milwaukee brewers - 6\".

There is no column or data indicating this context.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false because:\n- Not all games at County Stadium were won by Milwaukee Brewers.\n- The context of the 1982 World Series is not established in the table.\n\nThus, the relevant cells to verify these points are related to \"score\" and \"location\" for Games 3, 4, and 5.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
