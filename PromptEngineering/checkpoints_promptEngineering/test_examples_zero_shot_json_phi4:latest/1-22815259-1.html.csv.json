The claim states: \"there be only 1 record where the cowboy score 12 points.\" This means we should focus on the \"cowboys points\" column and look for any records where the value is 12.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the \"cowboys points\" column in the table.\n2. Check each row to see if there is a record with a cowboy score of 12.\n3. Count how many times a score of 12 appears.\n\nNow, let's examine the data:\n\n- Row 0: Cowboys Points = 23\n- Row 1: Cowboys Points = 27\n- Row 2: Cowboys Points = 39\n- Row 3: Cowboys Points = 37\n- Row 4: Cowboys Points = 40\n- Row 5: Cowboys Points = 16\n- Row 6: Cowboys Points = 14\n- **Row 7: Cowboys Points = 12**\n- Row 8: Cowboys Points = 10\n- Row 9: Cowboys Points = 12\n\nFrom this examination, we find that the cowboy score of 12 appears twice (in rows 7 and 9).\n\nSince the claim states there should be only one record with a cowboy score of 12, but we found two records, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are in column \"cowboys points\" at row indices 7 and 9.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"cowboys points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"cowboys points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
