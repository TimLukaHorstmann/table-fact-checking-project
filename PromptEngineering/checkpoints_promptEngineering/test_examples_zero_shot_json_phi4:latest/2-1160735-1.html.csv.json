    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break it down step by step:\n\n### Claim:\n\"amanda be the only name with the letter a before 1973\"\n\n### Conditions:\n1. **Name contains 'a':** We need to check if \"Amanda\" contains the letter 'a'.\n2. **Date before 1973:** The row for \"Amanda\" should have a date before 1973.\n3. **Uniqueness:** There should be no other names with the letter 'a' that also appear on or before 1973.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **Check if \"Amanda\" contains 'a':**\n   - From the table, Amanda is in row index 0 and column \"name\".\n   - The name \"amanda\" indeed contains the letter 'a'.\n\n2. **Check if Amanda's date is before 1973:**\n   - For \"amanda\", the year is 2000 (row index 0, column \"date\").\n   - Since 2000 is not before 1973, this condition fails.\n\n3. **Check other names for 'a' and dates before or on 1973:**\n   - We need to examine each row:\n     - Row 1 (\"andrew\", year 1973): The name \"andrew\" contains 'a'.\n     - Rows 2-4 have years 1993, 1998, and 2008 respectively. Only rows with dates on or before 1973 should be checked for 'a', but these are all after 1973.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince Amanda's date is not before 1973, the claim that \"amanda be the only name with the letter a before 1973\" fails because the condition itself is false. Additionally, there is another name \"andrew\" containing 'a' in 1973, but since Amanda\u2019s year doesn\u2019t qualify for comparison due to being after 1973, the failure is based solely on her date.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For checking if \"Amanda\" contains 'a': Row index 0, column \"name\".\n- For checking \"Amanda\"'s year: Row index 0, column \"date\".\n- For checking other names with 'a' and their dates (specifically looking for years \u2264 1973): Row index 1, columns \"name\" and \"date\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
