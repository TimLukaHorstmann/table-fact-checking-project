This is our primary candidate for being the first European release.\n\n3. **Check Other Regions**:\n   - We need to ensure there are no earlier releases outside of Europe by examining dates in other entries.\n   - The earliest date among all entries (excluding Europe) is \"18 october 2008\" for Australia, which is later than \"17 october 2008\".\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the European release on \"17 october 2008\" is earlier than any other global release dates listed, the claim appears to be true.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells for verifying this claim are those in row 0, specifically the \"country\" and \"date\" columns, as they confirm the European release date.\n   - Additionally, checking the earliest release date outside Europe (row 1) is necessary to ensure no earlier global release.\n\nBased on the above analysis, here's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Black Ice be never release as an LP, only as a CD,\" we need to check whether there are entries in the table where \"LP\" is mentioned without excluding CDs.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n\n- The claim specifies that \"Black Ice\" was not released on LP format.\n- We must find any rows indicating LP (or double LP) formats and verify if they exist or not.\n\n### Table Evaluation:\nWe will focus on the \"format\" column to see if there are entries with an LP format. \n\n#### Relevant Rows:\n\n1. **Row 0:**\n   - **Format:** \"cd, double lp\"\n   - This indicates that in Europe, on 17 October 2008, it was released as both CD and double LP.\n\n2. **Row 3:**\n   - **Format:** \"CD (limited edition steel - box)\"\n   - This does not include LP format.\n\n3. **Row 4:**\n   - **Format:** \"cd\"\n   - This is only a CD release, no LP involved.\n\n4. **Row 7:**\n   - **Format:** \"cd (limited edition steel - box)\"\n   - Again, this doesn't mention LP.\n\n#### Verification:\n- Row 0 clearly states the presence of an LP format (\"double lp\"), which contradicts the claim that it was never released as an LP.\n  \n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there is at least one instance (Europe on 17 October 2008) where \"Black Ice\" was released in double LP format.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
