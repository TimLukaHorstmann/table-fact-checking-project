    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify the following conditions from the claim: \n\n1. The plural form should be \"xweer (a) du\".\n2. If the above condition is met, then the singular form of this entry should be \"tlanka\".\n\nLet's examine the table data:\n\n- We look for the row where the plural column contains \"xweer (a) du\":\n  - This matches with the row:\n    ```json\n    [\n      \"xweera\",\n      \"n\",\n      \"xweer (a) du\",\n      \"n\",\n      \"night\"\n    ]\n    ```\n  - The singular for this entry is \"xweera\", not \"tlanka\".\n\n- We also check if any row with the plural form \"tlanka\" exists:\n  - There is a row where the singular column contains \"tlanka\":\n    ```json\n    [\n      \"tlanka\",\n      \"f\",\n      \"tlankadu\",\n      \"n\",\n      \"bridge\"\n    ]\n    ```\n  - The plural for this entry is \"tlankadu\", not \"xweer (a) du\".\n\nSince neither condition satisfies the claim, we conclude that the statement is false.\n\nRelevant cells for checking:\n- Singular and Plural columns of the row with plural \"xweer (a) du\" (row index 7).\n- Singular and Plural columns of the row with singular \"tlanka\" (row index 4).\n\nHere's the final JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"singular\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"plural\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"singular\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"plural\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
