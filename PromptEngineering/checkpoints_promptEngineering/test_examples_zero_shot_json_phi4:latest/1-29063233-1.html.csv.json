    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Lucy Watkins only wrote 6 episodes of Series 2\" is true or false, we need to verify how many episodes Lucy Watkins contributed to writing in Series 2 based on the provided table.\n\n### Steps for Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The column related to this claim is \"written by,\" as it tells us who wrote each episode.\n\n2. **Determine Series 2 Episodes**: According to the data, \"no for series\" indicates episodes in Series 2 when its value is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 12 (since there are 12 rows of data).\n\n3. **Count Episodes by Lucy Watkins**:\n   - Go through each row where \"no for series\" is between 1 and 12.\n   - Check the \"written by\" column to see if it contains the name \"Lucy Watkins.\"\n\n4. **Perform Verification**:\n\n   - Row 0: `no for series = 1`, Written by = Julian Jones\n   - Row 1: `no for series = 2`, Written by = Howard Overman\n   - Row 2: `no for series = 3`, Written by = Ben Vanstone\n   - Row 3: `no for series = 4`, Written by = Howard Overman\n   - **Row 9**: `no for series = 10`, Written by = Lucy Watkins\n   - **Row 11**: `no for series = 12`, Written by = Jake Michie\n\nFrom this, we see that Lucy Watkins is credited as the writer only for Row 9, which corresponds to one episode.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that Lucy Watkins wrote 6 episodes in Series 2. However, our examination of the data shows she wrote only 1 episode in Series 2. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"written by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"written by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThese are the relevant cells where Lucy Watkins is credited as a writer in Series 2.",
