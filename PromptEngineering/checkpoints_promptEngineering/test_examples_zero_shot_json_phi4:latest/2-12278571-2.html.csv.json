Check if Ben Curtis is listed as the winner for the year 2003.\n2. Confirm that his total score for that year is indeed 281.\n\nLet's examine the relevant parts of the table:\n\n- The \"player\" column identifies the player by name.\n- The \"year (s) won\" column specifies the year(s) the player won.\n- The \"total\" column provides the total score of the player.\n\nBy reviewing each row, we find:\n- Row 1: Player is Ernie Els with a winning year of 2002. This is not relevant to our claim.\n- Row 2: Player is Ben Curtis with a winning year of 2003 and a total score of 281. Both conditions match the claim perfectly.\n- Other rows do not involve Ben Curtis or the year 2003, so they are irrelevant for this verification.\n\nThus, both conditions in the claim are satisfied by row 1 (index 1 when starting from zero) with the columns \"player,\" \"year (s) won,\" and \"total.\"\n\nThe claim is therefore TRUE.
