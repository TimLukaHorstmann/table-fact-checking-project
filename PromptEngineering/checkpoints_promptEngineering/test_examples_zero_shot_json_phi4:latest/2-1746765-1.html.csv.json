    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding Paul's performance in both the Masters of Formula 3 series and the Formula 3 Euro Series, we need to examine the relevant parts of the table for entries related to these competitions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Series:**\n   - The claim mentions two specific series: \"Masters of Formula 3\" and \"Formula 3 Euro Series.\"\n   \n2. **Extract Data from Table:**\n   - We need to find rows where the \"series\" column matches either \"masters of formula 3\" or \"formula 3 euro series.\"\n\n3. **Check Performance in Each Series:**\n\n   - **Masters of Formula 3:**\n     - **2005:** \n       - Row index: 6\n       - Series: \"masters of formula 3\"\n       - Position: \"4th\"\n     - **2006:** \n       - Row index: 9\n       - Series: \"masters of formula 3\"\n       - Position: \"1st\"\n\n   - **Formula 3 Euro Series:**\n     - **2005:** \n       - Row index: 5\n       - Series: \"formula 3 euro series\"\n       - Position: \"10th\"\n     - **2006:** \n       - Row index: 8\n       - Series: \"formula 3 euro series\"\n       - Position: \"1st\"\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Paul came in last in both series.\n   - In the Masters of Formula 3:\n     - He finished 4th in 2005 and 1st in 2006, so he did not come in last.\n   - In the Formula 3 Euro Series:\n     - He finished 10th in 2005 and 1st in 2006, so he did not come in last.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false because Paul did not finish last in either series. The relevant cells that support this conclusion are those containing the \"position\" for each entry related to these two series.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
