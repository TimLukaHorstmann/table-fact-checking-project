The maximum transfer fee in the dataset should be 1 million.\n2. This transfer fee of 1 million should be paid twice to two different players.\n\n### Data Evaluation:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify Transfer Fees\nThe column related to this claim is \"transfer fee\". We need to extract and evaluate these values:\n- van bommel: 6 m\n- larsson: free\n- maxi: n/a\n- damia: 1 m\n- f navarro: 6 m\n- oscar lopez: n/a\n- gabri: free\n- r\u00fcst\u00fc: free\n- rodri: free\n\n#### Step 2: Determine the Largest Transfer Fee\nFrom the extracted fees, we observe:\n- The highest fee is \"6 m\" (6 million).\n- There are two instances of a 1-million fee (\"damia\").\n- Other transfer types include \"free\", \"n/a\".\n\n#### Step 3: Check if 1 Million Appears Twice\nThe transfer fee of 1 million appears twice for:\n- damia\n\nThere is no second player with a transfer fee of 1 million.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The largest transfer fee in the table is not 1 million; it's 6 million.\n- The 1-million transfer fee does not appear twice.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false. \n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\nWe focus on cells containing \"transfer fee\" values that are relevant to this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThese cells are relevant because they contain transfer fees that directly affect the evaluation of both parts of the claim.",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two parts:\n1. \"Maxi be loan to Mallorca\"\n2. \"Gabri be loan to Ajax\"\n\nLet's break down each part:\n\n### Part 1: \"Maxi be loan to Mallorca\"\n\n- **Row Identification**: Locate \"Maxi\" in the \"name\" column.\n  - Row index is 2.\n\n- **Verification**:\n  - Check the \"status\" for this row: it should be \"loan\".\n    - Found: \"loan\" (Column: status)\n  - Check the \"moving to\" column for this row: it should be \"Mallorca\".\n    - Found: \"mallorca\" (Column: moving to)\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied for Maxi being loaned to Mallorca.\n\n### Part 2: \"Gabri be loan to Ajax\"\n\n- **Row Identification**: Locate \"Gabri\" in the \"name\" column.\n  - Row index is 6.\n\n- **Verification**:\n  - Check the \"status\" for this row: it should be \"loan\".\n    - Found: \"transfer\" (Column: status)\n  - Check the \"moving to\" column for this row: it should be \"Ajax\".\n    - Found: \"ajax\" (Column: moving to)\n\nThe condition regarding the status is not satisfied because Gabri's status is \"transfer\", not \"loan\".

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Maxi is the only player on the list from Eurasia\" is true or false, we need to verify two conditions:\n\n1. **Identify Maxi's Continent**: Check if Maxi is indeed from Eurasia.\n2. **Check Other Players' Continents**: Ensure no other players in the table are listed as being from Eurasia.\n\nLet's go through these steps using the provided table data:\n\n### Step 1: Verify Maxi's Origin\n- The player \"Maxi\" is listed with the country \"arg,\" which refers to Argentina. Argentina is located in South America, not Eurasia.\n- Therefore, Maxi is not from Eurasia.\n\nSince Maxi is not from Eurasia, he cannot be considered as fulfilling part of the claim. Thus, we don't need to check for other players being from Eurasia.\n\n### Conclusion\n- The claim \"Maxi is the only player on the list from Eurasia\" is based on a false premise because Maxi himself is not from Eurasia.\n- Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nTo verify this, we checked the following relevant cells:\n\n1. **Row for Maxi**:\n   - Row index: 2 (0-based indexing)\n   - Column \"country\": to determine his origin\n\nHere is the JSON output with the conclusion and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
