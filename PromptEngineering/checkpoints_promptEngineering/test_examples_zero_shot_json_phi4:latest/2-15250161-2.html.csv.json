We are specifically interested in whether there is any data entry where the \"team\" is not \"suzuki\".\n2.

The claim states that Mitsuo Itoh competed three times per year between 1961 and 1967, except for in 1965 and 1967, where he only competed two times.\n\nLet's break down the claim:\n\n1. **Years of Interest**: 1961 to 1967.\n2. **Competition Frequency**:\n   - Three competitions per year from 1961 to 1966 (except 1965).\n   - Two competitions in 1965 and 1967.\n\nNow, let's examine the data for each relevant year:\n\n- **1961**: \n  - 125cc: 0 wins\n  - 250cc: 0 wins\n  - Total Competitions: 2\n\n- **1962**:\n  - 50cc: 23 points, 0 wins\n  - 125cc: 4 points, 0 wins\n  - Total Competitions: 2\n\n- **1963**:\n  - 50cc: 20 points, 1 win\n  - 125cc: 1 point, 0 wins\n  - Total Competitions: 2\n\n- **1964**:\n  - 50cc: 19 points, 0 wins\n  - 125cc: 6 points, 0 wins\n  - Total Competitions: 2\n\n- **1965**:\n  - 50cc: 16 points, 0 wins\n  - Total Competitions: 1\n\n- **1966**:\n  - 50cc: 3 points, 0 wins\n  - 125cc: 4 points, 0 wins\n  - Total Competitions: 2\n\n- **1967**:\n  - 50cc: 8 points, 1 win\n  - Total Competitions: 1\n\nNow, let's verify the claim:\n\n- For 1961 to 1966 (except 1965), the claim states three competitions per year.
