    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the last 2 games of the season be win for opponent in a home game\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data from the table. The table provides information about each week's date, opponent, result, and attendance.\n\nThe claim specifically refers to the last two games of the season:\n1. We must identify these last two games.\n2. Verify whether these games were won by the opponents.\n3. Confirm that they were home games (based on context, likely indicated by a certain condition related to the team being listed as \"opponent\").\n\nLet's examine each step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Last Two Games\nThe table has 16 entries for weeks, so:\n- The last game is in row index 15.\n- The second-to-last game is in row index 14.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Results of These Games\nFor these two games, check the \"result\" column to see if they were wins for the opponent:\n\n- **Row Index 14 (December 8, 1985):**\n  - Opponent: St. Louis Cardinals\n  - Result: L 28 - 16\n  - Interpretation: Loss, so this was not a win for the opponent.\n\n- **Row Index 15 (December 15, 1985):**\n  - Opponent: San Francisco 49ers\n  - Result: L 31 - 19\n  - Interpretation: Loss, so this was also not a win for the opponent.\n\n### Step 3: Confirm Home Games\nThe claim mentions home games. Typically, in such tables:\n- If the team name isn't explicitly mentioned as \"home\" or if we know from context (e.g., historical data) that these were home opponents, it implies they were played at the home venue of the team listed in the table.\n\nAssuming this is the case here (since no explicit \"home/away\" indication is provided), and focusing only on results:\n- Both games were losses for the team in question, meaning the opponent won.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe last two games were indeed wins for the opponents. If these are home games (as we've assumed based on context), then the claim holds true.\n\nThus, the answer is \"TRUE\".
