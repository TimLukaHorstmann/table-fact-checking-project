    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two main aspects of the claim against the table data:\n\n1. Identify the stadium named \"pasquale ianniello.\"\n2. Confirm its capacity.\n\nLet's analyze each aspect:\n\n- **Identifying the Stadium:**\n  The claim mentions a stadium called \"pasquale ianniello.\" By examining the \"stadium\" column of the table, we can identify which entry corresponds to this name.\n\n- **Verifying Capacity:**\n  Once the correct row is identified for \"pasquale ianniello,\" we need to check the \"capacity\" value in that row to ensure it matches the claim's stated capacity of 4000.\n\nNow, let's go through the table data:\n\n1. The first column after headers lists clubs. We need to find where \"pasquale ianniello\" is listed under \"stadium.\"\n\n2. Upon inspection:\n   - Row 1: \"quinto ricci\"\n   - Row 2: \"pasquale ianniello\" (matches the stadium name in the claim)\n   - Row 3: \"augusto bisceglia\"\n   - ... and so on.\n\n3. We identified that \"pasquale ianniello\" is in row index 1 (considering zero-based indexing).\n\n4. Next, we verify the capacity for this stadium by looking at the \"capacity\" column in the same row:\n   - Row 2 (\"row_index\": 1) has a \"capacity\" value of 4000.\n\nBoth conditions specified in the claim are satisfied:\n\n- The stadium named \"pasquale ianniello\" exists.\n- Its capacity is indeed 4000, as claimed.\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by the table data. \n\nThe relevant cells for verification are:\n- Row index 1, column \"stadium\"\n- Row index 1, column \"capacity\"\n\nHere's the JSON output with our conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"capacity\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
