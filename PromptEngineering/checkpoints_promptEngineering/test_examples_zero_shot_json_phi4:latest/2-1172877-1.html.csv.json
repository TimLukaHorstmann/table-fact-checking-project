    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Achille Varzi race in Tripoli\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to focus on two main pieces of information: the driver's name and the location.\n\n1. **Driver Name:** The claim specifically mentions Achille Varzi as the driver.\n2. **Location:** It also states that this occurred in Tripoli.\n\nWe will check the table for any entries where both conditions are met (i.e., rows where the driver is \"achille varzi\" and the location is \"tripoli\").\n\n**Step-by-step Verification:**\n\n- **Row 0:** \n  - Driver: giuseppe farina\n  - Location: mellaha\n  - Not relevant.\n\n- **Row 1:** \n  - Driver: hermann lang\n  - Location: mellaha\n  - Not relevant.\n\n- **Row 2:** \n  - Driver: hermann lang\n  - Location: mellaha\n  - Not relevant.\n\n- **Row 3:** \n  - Driver: hermann lang\n  - Location: mellaha\n  - Not relevant.\n\n- **Row 4:** \n  - Driver: achille varzi\n  - Location: mellaha\n  - Achille Varzi is mentioned, but the location is not Tripoli. Partially relevant for driver name only.\n\n- **Row 5:** \n  - Driver: rudolf caracciola\n  - Location: mellaha\n  - Not relevant.\n\n- **Row 6:** \n  - Driver: achille varzi\n  - Location: mellaha\n  - Achille Varzi is mentioned, but the location is not Tripoli. Partially relevant for driver name only.\n\n- **Row 7:** \n  - Driver: achille varzi\n  - Location: mellaha\n  - Achille Varzi is mentioned, but the location is not Tripoli. Partially relevant for driver name only.\n\n- **Rows 8 to 13:** These rows do not mention \"achille varzi\" as the driver. Therefore, they are irrelevant based on the driver condition.\n\nAfter examining all the rows, we find that Achille Varzi never raced in Tripoli according to this table. In every instance where Achille Varzi is mentioned, the location is Mellaha, not Tripoli.\n\nThus, the claim \"Achille Varzi race in Tripoli\" is false based on the data provided.\n\n**Relevant cells for verification:**\n- Rows 4, 6, and 7 are relevant because they mention Achille Varzi as the driver.\n- Column \"location\" is important to verify against Tripoli, but all these rows have \"mellaha.\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
