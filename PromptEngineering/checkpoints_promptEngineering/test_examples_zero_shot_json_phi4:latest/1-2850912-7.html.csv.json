This means Tom Ryan\u2019s pick number should be 5 less than Mike Stapleton\u2019s pick number.\n\nNow, let's extract and verify this information from the table:\n\n- From the data:\n  - Tom Ryan is found at row index 0 with a \"pick\" of 127.\n  - Mike Stapleton is located at row index 5 with a \"pick\" of 132.\n\nTo evaluate the claim:\n- Calculate the difference in their pick numbers: \\( 132 - 127 = 5 \\).\n- The claim requires Tom Ryan to be 5 places earlier, which means his pick number should be exactly 5 less than Mike Stapleton\u2019s. Since \\( 127 = 132 - 5 \\), this condition is satisfied.\n\nThus, the claim is true.\n\nFinally, we compile the relevant cells for verification:\n\n- For Tom Ryan: \n  - Row index: 0\n  - Column name: \"pick\"\n  \n- For Mike Stapleton:\n  - Row index: 5\n  - Column name: \"pick\"\n\nThe JSON response will be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate whether exactly 8 players in the table play a position other than centre. The relevant column for this task is \"position,\" and each row represents a player.\n\nLet's go through the data step by step:\n\n1. Identify all rows where the position is not \"centre.\"\n2. Count these instances.\n3. Verify if their number equals 8, as stated in the claim.\n\nHere are the entries from the table with positions other than centre:\n\n- Row 0: \"defence\" (Tom Ryan)\n- Row 1: \"defence\" (Ian Ferguson)\n- Row 2: \"centre\" (Timothy Hanley) - Not counted\n- Row 3: \"centre\" (Joseph Mcinnis) - Not counted\n- Row 4: \"defence\" (Mike Vellucci)\n- Row 5: \"centre\" (Mike Stapleton) - Not counted\n- Row 6: \"defence\" (Stefan Larsson)\n- Row 7: \"centre\" (Cliff Ronning) - Not counted\n- Row 8: \"centre\" (Luciano Borsato) - Not counted\n- Row 9: \"centre\" (Blaine Chrest) - Not counted\n- Row 10: \"defence\" (Scott Mactavish)\n- Row 11: \"defence\" (Kevan Melrose)\n- Row 12: \"left wing\" (Vladimir Kyhos)\n- Row 13: \"left wing\" (Thomas Hussey)\n- Row 14: \"right wing\" (Henrik Cedegren)\n- Row 15: \"defence\" (Tom Allen)\n- Row 16: \"centre\" (Timo Iljima) - Not counted\n- Row 17: \"goaltender\" (Darcy Wakaluk)\n- Row 18: \"centre\" (Mark Thietke) - Not counted\n- Row 19: \"defence\" (Kelly Murphy)\n- Row 20: \"defence\" (Heikki Riihijarvi)\n\nNow, count the rows with positions other than centre:\n\n1. Row 0\n2. Row 1\n3. Row 4\n4. Row 6\n5. Row 10\n6. Row 11\n7. Row 12\n8. Row 13\n9. Row 14\n10. Row 15\n11. Row 17\n12. Row 19\n13. Row 20\n\nThere are 13 players with positions other than centre, not 8 as the claim suggests.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
