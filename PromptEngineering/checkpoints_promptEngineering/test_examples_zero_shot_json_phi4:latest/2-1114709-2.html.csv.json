There should be no year with more than 2 recorded entries.\n2. Exactly four years must have exactly 2 recorded entries.\n\n### Steps for Verification:\n\n1. **Count the number of entries per year**:\n   - We will examine each row in the `data` column under the \"year\" key to determine how many times each year appears.\n\n2. **Check Maximum Number of Entries Per Year**:\n   - Ensure that no year has more than 2 entries, which aligns with the first part of the claim about the maximum number of races per year being 2.\n\n3. **Count Years with Exactly Two Entries**:\n   - Identify and count how many years have exactly two entries to validate the second part of the claim stating this occurs on 4 occasions.\n\n### Execution:\n\n1. **Data Counting by Year:**\n   - 1983: 1 entry\n   - 1984: 2 entries (row indices: 1, 2)\n   - 1985: 1 entry\n   - 1986: 2 entries (row indices: 5, 6)\n   - 1987: 1 entry\n   - 1988: 1 entry\n   - 1989: 2 entries (row indices: 8, 9)\n   - 1990: 1 entry\n   - 1991: 2 entries (row indices: 11, 12)\n   - 1992: 1 entry\n   - 1993: 1 entry\n\n2. **Validation Against Claim:**\n   - The maximum number of entries in any year is indeed 2, satisfying the first condition.\n   - Years with exactly 2 entries are 1984, 1986, 1989, and 1991.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Ligier Gitanes earned 37 points in races during 1989,\" we need to examine the table data for entries related to the team \"ligier gitanes\" and the year 1989.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - We look at each row to find where the \"team\" column contains \"ligier gitanes\".\n   - The relevant rows based on the team name are:\n     - Row with index 13: Team is \"ligier gitanes\", year is 1991, points are 0.\n     - Row with index 14: Team is \"ligier gitanes\", year is 1991, points are 0.\n     - Row with index 15: Team is \"ligier gitanes blondes\", year is 1992, points are 2.\n\n2. **Check the Year and Points:**\n   - We need to verify if there's any entry for the team \"ligier gitanes\" in the year 1989.\n   - None of the rows with \"ligier gitanes\" correspond to the year 1989.\n   - Additionally, no entries show that \"ligier gitanes\" earned 37 points in any year.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is false because there are no entries for \"ligier gitanes\" in 1989, and they did not earn 37 points in any given year based on the table data.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - Since we need to verify the absence of specific conditions (team name, year, and points), the relevant cells are those that contain this information:\n     - \"team\" column for rows 13, 14, and 15.\n     - \"year\" column for rows 13, 14, and 15.\n     - \"points\" column for rows 13, 14, and 15.\n\nThe JSON object reflecting the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"a Renault V10 engine be use during 2 race in 1991\" is true or false, we need to evaluate the table data for the year 1991 and specifically look at the columns related to the year, team, chassis, engine, and points. The relevant part of the table for this task includes checking if there are any entries with a Renault V10 engine in the specified year.\n\nLet's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Year**: We're interested in data from 1991.\n2. **Locate Entries for 1991**: Check each row to see if it belongs to the year 1991.\n3. **Check Engine Type**: For those entries, verify the engine type to identify if any of them used a Renault V10 engine.\n\nReviewing the table:\n\n- Rows with `year` = 1991:\n  - Row index 13: Team is \"ligier gitanes\", Chassis is \"ligier js35\", Engine is \"lamborghini v12\".\n  - Row index 14: Team is \"ligier gitanes\", Chassis is \"ligier js35b\", Engine is \"lamborghini v12\".\n\nIn both entries for the year 1991, the engine used was a Lamborghini V12 and not a Renault V10. Therefore, there are no instances where a Renault V10 engine was used in any race during 1991.\n\nThus, the claim that \"a renault v10 engine be use during 2 race in 1991\" is false.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"engine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"engine\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
