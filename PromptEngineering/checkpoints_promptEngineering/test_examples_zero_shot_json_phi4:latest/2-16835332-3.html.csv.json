Specifically, Row 0 confirms this with its corresponding cells for years and rank.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere is the relevant JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
