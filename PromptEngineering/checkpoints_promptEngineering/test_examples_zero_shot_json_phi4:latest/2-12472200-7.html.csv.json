Let's examine these:\n\n- **2007**: The year-end ranking is 49.\n- **2008**: The year-end ranking remains at 49.\n- **2009**: The year-end ranking drops to 52.\n- **2010**: The year-end ranking further decreases to 74.\n- **2011**: The year-end ranking continues to decrease, reaching 114.\n\nThe claim states that the rankings should always go up each year from 2007 to 2011. However, we can observe the following:\n\n- From 2007 (49) to 2008 (49), the rank does not change, so it doesn't increase.\n- From 2008 (49) to 2009 (52), there is a decrease in ranking.\n- From 2009 (52) to 2010 (74), there is another decrease.\n- From 2010 (74) to 2011 (114), the rank again decreases.\n\nSince her rankings do not increase and actually drop several times, the claim is false.
