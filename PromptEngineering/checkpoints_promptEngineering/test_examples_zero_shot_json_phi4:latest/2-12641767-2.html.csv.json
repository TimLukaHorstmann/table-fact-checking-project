There is a match on the 11th index (0-based).\n\n- Now, verify the \"score\" column for that specific row. The score listed for this date is \"1 - 6 6 - 1 3 - 6\", which matches the claim.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied: the date and score in the table match exactly with those specified in the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells to verify:\n- Row index 11 with column name \"date\" (for matching the date).\n- Row index 11 with column name \"score\" (for matching the score).\n\nThe relevant JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"an easy person to beat would be chen yanchong\" is true or false based on the provided table data, we need to analyze the relevant information from the dataset.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim suggests that Chen Yanchong was an \"easy person to beat.\" In a tennis context, this implies she lost matches with relatively easy scores (e.g., low margin of points).\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Data**:\n   - We need to focus on rows where Chen Yanchong is the opponent.\n   - Examine the \"outcome\" and \"score\" columns for these specific entries.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Table**:\n   - From the table, we locate Chen Yanchong in row index 0.\n   - In this entry:\n     - The \"opponent\" is \"chen yanchong\".\n     - The \"outcome\" is \"winner\", meaning the player won against her.\n     - The \"score\" was \"6 - 4 6 - 4\".\n\n4. **Evaluating the Score**:\n   - A score of \"6 - 4 6 - 4\" indicates a relatively straightforward match with small margins, which could be considered an easy victory.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on this single encounter where Chen Yanchong was defeated with a close but manageable score, the claim that she would be \"an easy person to beat\" is supported by this data point.\n   - However, it's important to note that one match does not provide comprehensive evidence of her overall difficulty as an opponent. Despite this limitation, given the context and instruction constraints (to determine truth based on available data), we consider the claim TRUE within this specific instance.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cell for verifying the claim is from row index 0 in both \"opponent\" and \"score\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
