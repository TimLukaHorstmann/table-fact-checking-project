    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if \"western oval\" was used as a venue on July 6, 1957.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Extract Relevant Data**:\n   - We focus on two columns: \"venue\" and \"date\".\n   - Check each row in the data for these conditions.\n\n2. **Check Each Row**:\n   - For each row, verify if the \"venue\" is \"western oval\" and the \"date\" is \"6 july 1957\".\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - In the second row of the table, we find:\n     - \"footscray\" vs. \"geelong\"\n     - \"venue\": \"western oval\"\n     - \"date\": \"6 july 1957\"\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since \"western oval\" is indeed listed as a venue on July 6, 1957, the claim that it was not included is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 1 (second row in zero-based indexing):\n  - Column: \"venue\"\n  - Column: \"date\"\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
