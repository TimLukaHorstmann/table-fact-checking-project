    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two specific conditions from the table: \n\n1. Whether \"twickenham stoop\" was indeed the venue on 6 April 2007.\n2. Whether the score for that game was 22 - 12.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. **Locate the entry with the date \"6 april 2007\":**\n   - We look at each row to find where the date matches \"6 april 2007\".\n\n2. **Verify the venue and score:**\n   - Once we identify the correct row, check if the venue is \"twickenham stoop\".\n   - Check if the result (score) for that match is \"22 - 12\".\n\nNow let's verify these details from the table:\n\n- The first row in the data list corresponds to:\n  - **Date:** \"6 april 2007\"\n  - **Venue:** \"twickenham stoop\"\n  - **Result (Score):** \"30 - 28\"\n\nFrom this, we can conclude:\n- The venue is indeed \"twickenham stoop\" on 6 April 2007.\n- However, the score for that game was \"30 - 28\", not \"22 - 12\".\n\nSince one of the conditions in the claim (the score being \"22 - 12\") does not match the data from the table, the claim is false.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n- The row where date matches \"6 april 2007\" is row index 0.\n- Relevant columns for verification are \"date\", \"venue\", and \"result\".\n\nThe JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
