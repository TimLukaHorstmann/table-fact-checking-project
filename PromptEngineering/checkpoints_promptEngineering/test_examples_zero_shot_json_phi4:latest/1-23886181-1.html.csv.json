Reviewing all rows:\n- Row 14 is indeed the only row where the \"continent\" column reads \"s america\".\n\nSince no other football clubs from the table are located in South America, and \"team brazil\" is indeed listed under this continent, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells to verify the claim are found on:\n- Row 14 for the columns \"continent\" and \"football club\".\n\nThus, the JSON response based on our analysis will be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"continent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"football club\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n(Note: Row indices are zero-based as per typical data table indexing conventions.)",
