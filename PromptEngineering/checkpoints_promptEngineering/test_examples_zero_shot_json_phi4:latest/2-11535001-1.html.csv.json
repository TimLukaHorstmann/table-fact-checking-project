    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, let's break down the claim and analyze it in relation to the provided table.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"More points were scored by the winning team in the 2011 World Cup qualification match in Bolivia than in the 2013 match.\"\n\n#### Key Points from the Claim:\n1. **Year of Matches**: The matches are from 2011 and 2013.\n2. **Type of Competition**: Both should be related to \"World Cup qualification.\"\n3. **Location**: Specifically mentions Bolivia for the 2011 match.\n4. **Comparison**: We need to compare points scored by the winning teams in these matches.\n\n### Table Analysis:\nThe table provides data about various matches with columns: `date`, `venue`, `score`, `result`, and `competition`.\n\n#### Relevant Matches:\n- **2011 Match**:\n  - Date: \"11 October 2011\"\n  - Venue: \"estadio monumental, santiago, chile\"\n  - Score: \"3 - 0\"\n  - Result: \"4 - 2\"\n  - Competition: \"2014 FIFA World Cup qualification\"\n\n- **2013 Match**:\n  - Date: \"15 October 2013\"\n  - Venue: \"estadio monumental, santiago, chile\"\n  - Score: \"2 - 0\"\n  - Result: \"2 - 1\"\n  - Competition: \"2014 FIFA World Cup qualification\"\n\n#### Verifying Conditions:\n- **Year and Competition**: Both matches are from the years mentioned (2011 and 2013) and are part of the \"World Cup qualification.\"\n- **Location for 2011 Match**: The claim specifies Bolivia, but the match in 2011 is actually in Chile. There is no match listed in Bolivia for 2011.\n- **Points Comparison**:\n  - For the 2011 match, the winning team (Chile) scored 3 points.\n  - For the 2013 match, the winning team (Chile) scored 2 points.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim incorrectly specifies a location (Bolivia) for the 2011 match. Since there is no 2011 World Cup qualification match in Bolivia listed in the table, the condition about the location is not met. Therefore, the claim cannot be true based on the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify several components against the provided table data:\n\n1. **Venue Location**: The claim mentions \"estadio monumental in japan,\" which needs verification. According to the data:\n   - On 11 October 2011 and 15 October 2013, matches were held at \"estadio monumental.\"\n   - Both events are listed as being in Santiago, Chile.\n\n2. **Type of Competition**: The claim specifies a \"world cup qualify\" (qualification) event on both dates.\n   - According to the data:\n     - On 11 October 2011, the competition was \"2014 FIFA World Cup qualification.\"\n     - On 15 October 2013, the competition was also \"2014 FIFA World Cup qualification.\"\n\n3. **Date and Location Consistency**: The claim needs to match both date and location for each instance.\n   - For both dates (11 October 2011 and 15 October 2013), the matches were held at \"estadio monumental\" in Santiago, Chile, not Japan.\n\nBased on these checks:\n\n- The venue is correctly identified as \"estadio monumental,\" but it is located in Santiago, Chile, not Japan.\n- The competition type aligns with the claim (World Cup qualification).\n\nThe false aspect of the claim is the location: \"estadio monumental\" is not in Japan.
