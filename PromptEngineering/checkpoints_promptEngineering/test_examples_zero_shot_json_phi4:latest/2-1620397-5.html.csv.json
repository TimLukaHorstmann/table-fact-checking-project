Let's select the first three episodes for simplicity:\n     - Row 0: \"the elite\" featuring Tegan, Nyssa, Dalek\n     - Row 1: \"hexagora\" featuring Tegan, Nyssa\n     - Row 2: \"the children of seth\" featuring Tegan, Nyssa\n\n2. **Count Characters in Each Episode**:\n   - **Row 0**: 3 characters (Tegan, Nyssa, Dalek)\n   - **Row 1**: 2 characters (Tegan, Nyssa)\n   - **Row 2**: 2 characters (Tegan, Nyssa)\n\n3. **Calculate Total Characters**:\n   - Combine all characters from the selected episodes: Tegan, Nyssa, Dalek\n   - Count distinct characters: Tegan, Nyssa, Dalek = 3 distinct characters\n\n4. **Verify Claim**:\n   - The total number of distinct characters across these three episodes is indeed 3.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n- Row 0, Column \"featuring\": [\"tegan\", \"nyssa\", \"dalek\"]\n- Row 1, Column \"featuring\": [\"tegan\", \"nyssa\"]\n- Row 2, Column \"featuring\": [\"tegan\", \"nyssa\"]\n\nThese cells are relevant to verify the claim.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is TRUE based on the selected episodes and their featured characters.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"featuring\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"featuring\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"featuring\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
