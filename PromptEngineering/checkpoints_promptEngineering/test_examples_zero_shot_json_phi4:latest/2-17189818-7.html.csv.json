Whether Peter Leko has a score of 100 in Jermuk.\n2. Whether he has a score of 140 in Nalchik.\n\n### Verification Process:\n\n1. **Locate Peter Leko in the table**:\n   - The player name \"Peter leko ( hun )\" corresponds to row index 7.\n\n2. **Check the relevant scores for Peter Leko**:\n   - From the data at row index 7, we examine the columns for Jermuk and Nalchik.\n     - **Jermuk**: The value is `100`.\n     - **Nalchik**: The value is `140`.\n\nBoth conditions specified in the claim are satisfied by Peter Leko's scores.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince both parts of the claim are verified against the table data, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"jermuk\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"nalchik\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify each condition mentioned in the claim against the provided table:\n\n1. **Condition**: The player should have played 4 matches.\n2. **Condition**: The player's qualification status should be \"rl\" (which stands for some classification, likely related to ranking or level).\n3. **Condition**: The score at Jermuk should be less than 140.\n\nLet's evaluate the conditions against each row in the data:\n\n- We need to focus on players who have a column \"played\" with value 4.\n- Out of these, we further filter for those having \"qual\" as \"rl\".\n- Finally, check their score at Jermuk to ensure it is less than 140.\n\nLet's go through the data row by row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: \n   - Played: 3 (does not meet condition 1)\n   \n2. **Row 1**:\n   - Player: Teimour Radjabov\n   - Qual: rl\n   - Played: 4\n   - Jermuk: \"-\" (indeterminate, not less than 140)\n\n3. **Row 2**: \n   - Qual: rr (does not meet condition 2)\n   \n4. **Row 3**:\n   - Qual: hc (does not meet condition 2)\n   \n5. **Row 4**:\n   - Qual: pr (does not meet condition 2)\n   \n6. **Row 5**: \n   - Player: Vugar Gashimov\n   - Qual: hc (does not meet condition 2)\n\n7. **Row 6**:\n   - Player: Peter Leko\n   - Qual: rl\n   - Played: 4\n   - Jermuk: 100 (meets all conditions)\n   \n8. **Row 7**: \n   - Player: Shakhriyar Mamedyarov\n   - Qual: rl\n   - Played: 4\n   - Jermuk: \"-\" (indeterminate, not less than 140)\n\n9. **Row 8**:\n   - Qual: rr (does not meet condition 2)\n   \n10. **Row 9**: \n    - Qual: rr (does not meet condition 2)\n    \n11. **Row 10**:\n    - Player: Boris Gelfand\n    - Qual: rl\n    - Played: 4\n    - Jermuk: \"-\" (indeterminate, not less than 140)\n\n12. **Row 11**: \n    - Qual: hc (does not meet condition 2)\n    \n13. **Row 12**:\n    - Player: Magnus Carlsen\n    - Qual: cp (does not meet condition 2)\n    \n14. **Row 13**:\n    - Qual: rr (does not meet condition 2)\n\n15. **Row 14**: \n    - Player: David Navara\n    - Qual: hc (does not meet condition 2)\n\n16. **Row 15**: \n    - Qual: hc (does not meet condition 2)\n    \n17. **Row 16**:\n    - Player: Yannick Pelletier\n    - Played: 0 (does not meet condition 1)\n\nFrom this evaluation, only Row 6 meets all the conditions specified in the claim.
