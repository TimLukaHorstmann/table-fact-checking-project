This satisfies the condition of more than 4 countries tying for 10th place.\n\n2. **\"each win a bronze medal\"**:\n   - We need to check the \"bronze\" column for these four countries.\n   - Burkina Faso: Bronze = 1\n   - Ivory Coast: Bronze = 1\n   - Gabon: Bronze = 1\n   - Madagascar: Bronze = 1\n\nAll four countries tied for 10th place and each won one bronze medal.
