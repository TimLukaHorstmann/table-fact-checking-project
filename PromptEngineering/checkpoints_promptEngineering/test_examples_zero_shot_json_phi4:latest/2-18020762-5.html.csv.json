    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify specific conditions from the table:\n\nThe claim states: \"the 200 m individual medley take place on 19 december 2009\"\n\nWe will break this down into two main parts:\n1. Verify if there's an entry for the \"200 m individual medley.\"\n2. Check if the date for this event is \"19 December 2009.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n#### Part 1: Finding the Event\n- The table has a column labeled \"event.\" We need to locate the row where the event name is \"200 m individual medley.\"\n\nLooking at the data:\n- The entry in the fifteenth index (considering zero-based indexing) of the data array matches our required event name:\n  - `[\"200 m individual medley\", \"2:04.60\", \"19 december 2009\", \"duel in the pool\", \"manchester , united kingdom\"]`\n\nThis confirms that there is an entry for the \"200 m individual medley.\"\n\n#### Part 2: Verifying the Date\n- Now, we need to check if the date associated with this event matches \"19 December 2009.\"\n  \nFrom the same row in the table:\n- The value under the column \"date\" is \"19 december 2009,\" which exactly matches the claim.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are satisfied:\n\n1. There is an entry for \"200 m individual medley.\"\n2. This event took place on \"19 December 2009.\"\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n  - Row index: 15\n    - Column name: \"event\" (value: \"200 m individual medley\")\n    - Column name: \"date\" (value: \"19 december 2009\")\n\nTherefore, we conclude that the answer is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if the event \"200 m individual medley\" on \"19 December 2009\" is the only event recorded for that date in the table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - We need to find all rows where the \"date\" column equals \"19 december 2009\".\n\n2. **Check Each Row for Matching Date:**\n   - Iterate through each row and check if the value in the \"date\" column is \"19 december 2009\".\n   \n3. **List Events on This Date:**\n   - For any row that matches, note the event listed in the \"event\" column.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"200 m individual medley\" should be the only event on this date.\n   - If there are no other events besides \"200 m individual medley\", the claim is true. Otherwise, it is false.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - We need to record the row index and column name for each relevant cell where the date matches.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n- Row 2 has the event \"200 m freestyle\" on \"19 december 2009\".\n- Row 11 has the event \"100 m breaststroke\" on \"19 december 2009\".\n- Row 16 has the event \"200 m individual medley\" on \"19 december 2009\".\n\nSince there are multiple events recorded on \"19 December 2009\", the claim is false.\n\nHere is the JSON output with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
