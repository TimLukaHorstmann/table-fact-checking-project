The home team score here is \"21.16 (142)\", which matches the claim.\n- Row 2: Home team is \"north melbourne\", so this does not match.\n- Row 3: Home team is \"hawthorn\", so this does not match.\n- Row 4: Home team is \"essendon\", so this does not match.\n- Row 5: Home team is \"swans\", so this does not match.\n\nFrom this analysis, the claim is supported by the data in row 1.
