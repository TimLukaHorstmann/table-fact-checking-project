The goal is to find out how many entries were built by \"Brighton\" compared to other builders.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: \n   - The relevant column for this claim is the \"builder\" column.\n\n2. **Count Entries per Builder**:\n   - Count how many times each unique builder appears in the table.\n   \n3. **Determine Proportion of Brighton**:\n   - Calculate the proportion of entries built by \"Brighton\" out of the total number of entries.\n\n4. **Interpret Claim**:\n   - The claim states \"nearly all,\" which suggests a high majority, typically interpreted as over 50% and preferably much higher to be considered \"nearly all.\"\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Total Entries**: There are 30 rows in the table.\n  \n- **Count for Brighton**:\n  - Count how many times \"Brighton\" appears in the \"builder\" column.\n\n- **Count for Other Builders**:\n  - Count appearances of other builders like \"Eastleigh.\"\n\n### Calculation:\n\n1. **Brighton Count**:\n   - Entries built by \"Brighton\": 24\n\n2. **Other Builders Count**:\n   - Entries built by \"Eastleigh\": 6\n\n3. **Proportion**:\n   - Proportion of Brighton = (Number of entries by Brighton) / (Total number of entries)\n   - Proportion of Brighton = 24/30 = 0.8 or 80%\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Since 80% of the production is attributed to \"Brighton,\" which is a significant majority, the claim that \"nearly all of the production be in Brighton\" holds true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells are those in the \"builder\" column where the builder is either \"Brighton\" or another builder.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the table data, let's break down and analyze it step-by-step.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"majority of the locomotive whenbuilt and withdraw be cannot handle non - empty timestamp argument!\"\n\n#### Key Points:\n1. **Non-Empty Timestamp Argument**: The claim implies that a majority of entries in the 'whenbuilt' and 'withdrawn' columns are such that they should not accept additional information (a timestamp) because these fields already have values.\n\n2. **Majority Requirement**: For this to be true, more than half of the rows need to have non-empty 'whenbuilt' and 'withdrawn' entries.\n\n### Data Inspection:\n- **Columns Relevant to the Claim**:\n  - `whenbuilt`: This column should contain a year or date indicating when each locomotive was built.\n  - `withdrawn`: This column should contain a year or date indicating when each locomotive was withdrawn from service.\n\n### Table Analysis:\n1. **Non-Empty Entries in Columns**:\n   - Every row has non-empty entries for both the 'whenbuilt' and 'withdrawn' columns. Each entry is either a specific year or an indication of a month/year (e.g., \"march 1950\", \"april 1950\").\n\n2. **Counting Rows with Non-Empty Entries**:\n   - The table has a total of 30 rows.\n   - All 30 rows have non-empty values in both the 'whenbuilt' and 'withdrawn' columns.\n\n3. **Majority Evaluation**:\n   - Since all 30 rows satisfy having non-empty entries in these columns, this indeed constitutes a majority (100% of the data).\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven that every row has non-empty entries for the specified columns, the claim is fully supported by the table data.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we must first interpret it properly. The claim states: \"majority of the locomotive whenbuilt and withdraw be can handle non - empty timestamp argument!\"\n\nThis means we need to check if a majority (more than half) of the entries in both the \"whenbuilt\" and \"withdrawn\" columns have non-empty values.\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure**:\n   - The table has two relevant columns for this claim: \"whenbuilt\" and \"withdrawn\".\n   - Each entry under these columns is supposed to be a year or a date, indicating when the locomotive was built or withdrawn.\n\n2. **Identify Non-Empty Values**:\n   - A non-empty value in this context means any value that is not an empty string (or null).\n\n3. **Count Non-Empty Entries**:\n   - We will count how many entries under \"whenbuilt\" and \"withdrawn\" are non-empty.\n   - Since both columns have the same number of rows, we can focus on one row at a time.\n\n4. **Determine Majority**:\n   - The total number of rows in the table is 26 (from index 0 to 25).\n   - A majority would mean more than half, which is greater than 13 non-empty entries.\n\n5. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - For each row from index 0 to 25, check if both \"whenbuilt\" and \"withdrawn\" have non-empty values.\n\n6. **Count Non-Empty Entries for Both Columns**:\n   - Go through each row and count how many times both columns have non-empty entries.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - If more than half of the rows (i.e., more than 13) have non-empty values in both \"whenbuilt\" and \"withdrawn\", then the claim is true.\n   - Otherwise, it is false.\n\nLet's perform this analysis:\n\n- All entries for \"whenbuilt\" from row index 0 to 25 are non-empty: \n  - They include years like \"1948\", \"1949\", \"1950\", \"march 1950\", etc.\n  \n- Similarly, all entries for \"withdrawn\" from row index 0 to 25 are also non-empty:\n  - They include years like \"1967\", \"1964\", \"1966\", \"september 1964\", etc.\n\nSince all rows have non-empty values in both columns, the count of non-empty entries is 26 for each column, which is more than half of 26.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"whenbuilt\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"withdrawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"whenbuilt\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"withdrawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"whenbuilt\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"withdrawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"whenbuilt\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"withdrawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"whenbuilt\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"withdrawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"whenbuilt\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"withdrawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"whenbuilt\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"withdrawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"whenbuilt\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"withdrawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"whenbuilt\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"withdrawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"whenbuilt\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"withdrawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"whenbuilt\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"withdrawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"whenbuilt\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"withdrawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"whenbuilt\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"withdrawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"whenbuilt\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"withdrawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"whenbuilt\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"withdrawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"whenbuilt\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"withdrawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"whenbuilt\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"withdrawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"whenbuilt\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"withdrawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"whenbuilt\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"withdrawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"whenbuilt\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"withdrawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"whenbuilt\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"withdrawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"whenbuilt\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"withdrawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"whenbuilt\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"withdrawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"whenbuilt\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"withdrawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"whenbuilt\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"withdrawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"whenbuilt\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"withdrawn\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
