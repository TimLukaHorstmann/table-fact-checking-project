    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to check several aspects of the provided table against the details in the claim:\n\n1. **Date Verification**: The claim states \"on 14 May 1959\". We must find a row with this specific date.\n2. **Pilot Verification**: The claim mentions \"Donald Campbell\" as the pilot. We should verify if Donald Campbell is listed as the pilot on the specified date.\n3. **Craft Verification**: The claim specifies the craft \"Bluebird K7\". We need to ensure that Bluebird K7 is associated with this row.\n4. **Location Verification**: Lastly, the claim states \"at Lake Mead\" as the location, which we must verify against the table.\n\nLet's examine each of these points based on the provided data:\n\n- **Date Check**: Look for a row where the date column matches \"14 May 1959\". According to the data, there is indeed a row with this date.\n  \n- **Pilot Verification**: On the identified date (14 May 1959), check if Donald Campbell is listed as the pilot. The data confirms that Donald Campbell is the pilot for this entry.\n\n- **Craft Verification**: Confirm that \"Bluebird K7\" is the craft associated with this row. The data shows Bluebird K7 is indeed the craft on this date.\n\n- **Location Verification**: Finally, verify if the location is \"Lake Mead\". According to the table, the location is \"Coniston Water\", not Lake Mead.\n\nSince the location does not match the claim (\"Lake Mead\" vs. \"Coniston Water\"), the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells for verifying this claim are from row index 28 (0-based index) and include checks against columns: \"pilot (s)\", \"craft\", \"date\", and \"location\".\n\nHere's the JSON object representing the conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"pilot (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"craft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
