    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the second most point score by the 2000 Patriot in a single game was 30\" is true or false, we need to examine the data provided for each game and extract the points scored by the Patriots.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Identify Points Scored:** For each game entry in the table, extract the number of points scored by the Patriots. This information is part of the \"result\" column, formatted as \"l/w X - Y\", where X is the Patriots' score and Y is the opponent's score.\n\n2. **List Points Scored:**\n   - Week 1: Lost to Tampa Bay Buccaneers (21-16) \u2192 Patriots scored 16 points.\n   - Week 2: Lost to New York Jets (20-19) \u2192 Patriots scored 19 points.\n   - Week 3: Lost to Minnesota Vikings (21-13) \u2192 Patriots scored 13 points.\n   - Week 4: Lost to Miami Dolphins (10-3) \u2192 Patriots scored 3 points.\n   - Week 5: Won against Denver Broncos (28-19) \u2192 Patriots scored 28 points.\n   - Week 6: Won against Indianapolis Colts (24-16) \u2192 Patriots scored 24 points.\n   - Week 7: Lost to New York Jets (34-17) \u2192 Patriots scored 17 points.\n   - Week 8: Lost to Indianapolis Colts (30-23) \u2192 Patriots scored 23 points.\n   - Week 10: Lost to Buffalo Bills (16-13) \u2192 Patriots scored 13 points.\n   - Week 11: Lost to Cleveland Browns (19-11) \u2192 Patriots scored 11 points.\n   - Week 12: Won against Cincinnati Bengals (16-13) \u2192 Patriots scored 16 points.\n   - Week 13: Lost to Detroit Lions (34-9) \u2192 Patriots scored 9 points.\n   - Week 14: Won against Kansas City Chiefs (30-24) \u2192 Patriots scored 30 points.\n   - Week 15: Lost to Chicago Bears (24-17) \u2192 Patriots scored 17 points.\n   - Week 16: Won against Buffalo Bills (13-10) \u2192 Patriots scored 13 points.\n   - Week 17: Lost to Miami Dolphins (27-24) \u2192 Patriots scored 24 points.\n\n3. **Determine the Second Highest Score:** \n   - First, sort the scores in descending order: 30, 28, 24, 24, 23, 19, 17, 17, 16, 16, 13, 13, 13, 11, 9, 3.\n   - The highest score is 30 (Week 14).\n   - The second highest score is 28 (Week 5).\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:** \n   - The claim states that the second most points scored was 30. However, we found that the second most points were actually 28.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim is false because the second most points scored by the Patriots in a single game was not 30, but rather 28.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- All rows are relevant to determine the scores for each game, specifically the \"result\" column. The row indices corresponding to these scores are needed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
