    "resp": "To verify the claim \"there be 7 more i1 build than i3,\" we need to compare the number of units built (indicated by the column \"no built\") for classes `i1` and `i3`.\n\nHere's how we can evaluate this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - For class `i1`, locate the row where the \"class\" is `\"i1\"` and check the value in the \"no built\" column.\n   - For class `i3`, locate the row where the \"class\" is `\"i3\"` and check the value in the \"no built\" column.\n\n2. **Extract Values:**\n   - From the table:\n     - The entry for `i1` is found at `row_index 2` with \"no built\" = 20.\n     - The entry for `i3` is found at `row_index 4` with \"no built\" = 27.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - Calculate the difference in the number of units built between `i1` and `i3`: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Difference} = \\text{\"no built\" for i1} - \\text{\"no built\" for i3} = 20 - 27 = -7\n     \\]\n   - This indicates that there are actually 7 fewer `i1` builds than `i3`, not more.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states there should be \"7 more i1 build than i3,\" which is incorrect based on the data. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - For class `i1`: Row 2, Column \"no built\"\n   - For class `i3`: Row 4, Column \"no built\"\n\nThus, the JSON object representing the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"no built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"no built\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine if there are indeed 10 fewer i1 locomotives built than c3 locomotives based on the given table.\n\n### Step-by-step Evaluation:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - The row for class \"c3\" will provide information about the number of c3 locomotives built.\n   - The row for class \"i1\" will provide information about the number of i1 locomotives built.\n\n2. **Extract Data from Table:**\n   - For class \"c3\":\n     - From the table, locate the row where `class` is \"c3\". This corresponds to the second entry (index 1).\n     - The value in the \"no built\" column for this row is `10`.\n   \n   - For class \"i1\":\n     - Locate the row where `class` is \"i1\". This corresponds to the third entry (index 2).\n     - The value in the \"no built\" column for this row is `20`.\n\n3. **Calculate Difference:**\n   - Calculate the difference between the number of i1 locomotives and c3 locomotives:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Difference} = \\text{i1 no built} - \\text{c3 no built} = 20 - 10 = 10\n     \\]\n\n4. **Interpret the Claim:**\n   - The claim states \"there be 10 fewer i1 build than c3\". This implies that the number of i1 locomotives should be less by 10 compared to c3.\n   - However, our calculation shows there are actually 10 more i1 locomotives built than c3.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the claim is incorrect based on the table data, the answer is \"FALSE\".\n\n6. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n     - Row index 1, column name \"no built\" (for class \"c3\").\n     - Row index 2, column name \"no built\" (for class \"i1\").\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"no built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"no built\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
