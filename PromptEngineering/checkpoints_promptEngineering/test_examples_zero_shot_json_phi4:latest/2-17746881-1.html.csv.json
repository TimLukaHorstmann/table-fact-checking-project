The columns are:\n- `team 1`: Name of the first team.\n- `score`: Overall score after both rounds.\n- `team 2`: Name of the second team.\n- `1st round`: Score in the first round.\n- `2nd round`: Score in the second round.\n\n### Step 2: Extracting Relevant Information\n\nThe claim states that \"aj auxerre (d1)\" has 4 more points than \"sm caen (d1)\" overall.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to compare the overall points scored by two teams: FC Mulhouse (d2) and US Orl\u00e9ans (d2), both from division 2.\n\nThe relevant data in the table is as follows:\n\n1. **FC Mulhouse (d2)**:\n   - They are team 2 against Lille OSC.\n   - The total score for FC Mulhouse over two rounds is \"2 - 3\".\n   - Therefore, they scored a total of 2 goals.\n\n2. **US Orl\u00e9ans (d2)**:\n   - They are team 1 against Paris SG.\n   - The total score for US Orl\u00e9ans over two rounds is \"3 - 7\".\n   - Therefore, they scored a total of 3 + 4 = 7 goals.\n\nNow let's compare the scores:\n\n- FC Mulhouse scored 2 goals in total.\n- US Orl\u00e9ans scored 7 goals in total.\n\nThe claim states that \"team 2 fc mulhouse (d2) score more overall point than team 2 us orl\u00e9ans (d2)\". However, US Orl\u00e9ans scored more goals than FC Mulhouse. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNext, we identify the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- For FC Mulhouse: \n  - Row index 3, columns \"score\" and \"2nd round\".\n  \n- For US Orl\u00e9ans:\n  - Row index 6, columns \"score\" and \"1st round\".\n\nHere is the JSON response with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2nd round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim that \"aj auxerre (d1) have 5 more points than sm caen (d1) overall,\" we need to determine the number of points each team earned over two rounds.\n\nIn football competitions, typically:\n- A win earns a team 3 points.\n- A draw earns both teams 1 point.\n- A loss earns no points.\n\nLet's break down the table data relevant to the claim:\n\n1. **aj auxerre (d1) vs. ogc nice (d1):**\n   - First round: aj auxerre 1 - 2 ogc nice (Loss for aj auxerre)\n     - Points earned by aj auxerre in first round = 0\n   - Second round: aj auxerre 0 - 3 ogc nice (Loss for aj auxerre)\n     - Points earned by aj auxerre in second round = 0\n   - Total points for aj auxerre over two rounds = 0 + 0 = 0\n\n2. **sm caen (d1) vs. as beauvais (d2):**\n   - First round: sm caen 0 - 1 as beauvais (Loss for sm caen)\n     - Points earned by sm caen in first round = 0\n   - Second round: sm caen 1 - 3 as beauvais (Loss for sm caen)\n     - Points earned by sm caen in second round = 0\n   - Total points for sm caen over two rounds = 0 + 0 = 0\n\nNow, compare the total points:\n- aj auxerre has 0 points.\n- sm caen has 0 points.\n\nThe claim states that aj auxerre have 5 more points than sm caen. However, both teams earned 0 points, meaning there is no difference in their point totals. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nTo verify this conclusion, we identified the relevant rows and columns:\n- Row index 2 contains data for \"aj auxerre (d1)\" vs. \"ogc nice (d1)\"\n- Row index 5 contains data for \"sm caen (d1)\" vs. \"as beauvais (d2)\"\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
