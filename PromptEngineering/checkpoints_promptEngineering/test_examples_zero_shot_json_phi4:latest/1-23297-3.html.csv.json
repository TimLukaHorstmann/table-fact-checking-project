The closest relevant data is:\n     - Year: 1999\n     - Championship: Rome\n     - Opponent in the final: Gustavo Kuerten\n\n   Since there is no record of a championship in Rome in 1998, this part of the claim is false.\n\n2. **Claim:** \"the opponent in the final in 2001 at the Canada (Montreal) championship be Pete Sampras\"\n   - We need to find an entry with the year 2001 and the championship location as Canada (Montreal).\n   - From the table, the relevant data is:\n     - Year: 2001\n     - Championship: Canada (Montreal)\n     - Opponent in the final: Andrei Pavel\n\n   The opponent was not Pete Sampras but Andrei Pavel.
