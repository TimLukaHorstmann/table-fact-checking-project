The relevant cell for verifying this claim is located at:\n\n- Row index: 4 (since JSON indexing typically starts from zero)\n- Column name: \"winning pitcher\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"winning pitcher\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

This is essential for checking when games occurred.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row:**\n   - We will check each row under the \"date\" column to see if any other rows besides the first one have \"may 20\" as their date value.\n\n3. **Check the Data:**\n\n   - **Row 0:** The date is \"may 20\". This matches the claim.\n   \n   - **Row 1:** The date is \"may 21\". This does not match the claim.\n   \n   - **Row 2:** The date is \"may 22\".
