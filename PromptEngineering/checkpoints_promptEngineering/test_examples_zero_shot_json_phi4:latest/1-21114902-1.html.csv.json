This identifies his row in the table.\n   \n3. **Extract Submission Count:**\n   - Once Matt Wiman's row is identified, we need to extract the value from the column labeled \"submissions of the night\".\n\n4. **Verify Claim Against Table Data:**\n   - Check if the extracted number matches 1 as claimed.\n\n5. **Determine Truthfulness:**\n   - If the \"submissions of the night\" for Matt Wiman is indeed 1, then the claim is true.\n   - Otherwise, it's false.\n\n**Execution:**\n\n- Scan the data to find Matt Wiman:\n  ```json\n  [\n    ...\n    [\"matt wiman\", 4, 0, 1, 5, \"active\"],\n    ...\n  ]\n  ```\n  - Matt Wiman is in row with index 19 (considering 0-based indexing).\n\n- Extract the relevant data from his row:\n  - Column \"submissions of the night\" has a value of 1.\n\n- Compare this to the claim that states there was 1 submission of the night for Matt Wiman.\n\nThe extracted value matches the claim, so it is TRUE.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- The relevant cells in this verification are those containing:\n  - The \"fighter\" column where Matt Wiman's name appears (for identifying him).\n  - The \"submissions of the night\" column which provides the count for his submissions.\n\nThus, the final JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"fighter\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"submissions of the night\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Joe Lauzon have 5 fights of the night and 1 knockout of the night,\" we need to verify two specific pieces of information from the provided table:\n\n1. The number of \"Fights of the Night\" for Joe Lauzon.\n2. The number of \"Knockouts of the Night\" for Joe Lauzon.\n\nThe table is in JSON format with columns labeled as: \n- fighter\n- fights of the night\n- knockouts of the night\n- submissions of the night\n- awards total\n- status\n\nGiven this structure, we identify that:\n- The column \"fighter\" will help us locate Joe Lauzon.\n- The column \"fights of the night\" gives the number of times he received this award.\n- The column \"knockouts of the night\" provides information on how many times he achieved a knockout as part of these awards.\n\nBy examining the table data, we find:\n- Joe Lauzon is in the first row (index 0) of the dataset. \n- In the row where Joe Lauzon appears:\n  - The value under \"fights of the night\" is 5.\n  - The value under \"knockouts of the night\" is 1.\n\nBoth these values align with the claim made about him having 5 fights of the night and 1 knockout of the night. Therefore, the conditions stated in the claim are fully supported by the data provided in the table.\n\nThus, we conclude that the answer to the claim is \"TRUE.\" The relevant cells from which this information was extracted include the first row's entries under both the \"fights of the night\" and \"knockouts of the night\" columns.\n\nHere's the JSON response summarizing our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"fights of the night\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"knockouts of the night\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states there are \"2 submission[s] of the night,\" which does not match.\n\nSince the number of submissions of the night according to the table is 1 and not 2 as claimed, we can conclude that:\n\n- The first condition (\"Submissions of the Night for Matt Wiman should be 2\") is false.\n  \nTherefore, the claim \"2 submission of the night occur when the fighter be matt wiman\" is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's specify which cells from the table are relevant to this evaluation. We focus on the row corresponding to Matt Wiman:\n\n- **Row Index for Matt Wiman:** 19 (Zero-based index)\n- **Relevant Column Name:** \"Submissions of the Night\"\n\nThe JSON response should be structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"submissions of the night\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis answer reflects that the claim is false based on the data in the table and identifies the specific cell used to verify this conclusion.",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"Joe Lauzon have 4 knockout,\" we need to assess the relevant data in the table.\n\nThe claim specifically pertains to Joe Lauzon's number of knockouts. Therefore, we should focus on the following:\n\n1. **Identify Joe Lauzon's Row**: The first column is labeled \"fighter\" and contains the names of individuals. We need to locate Joe Lauzon within this column.\n2. **Locate Knockout Information**: Once Joe Lauzon's row is identified, we need to examine the \"knockouts of the night\" column in that same row to verify the number of knockouts.\n\nSteps for Verification:\n\n1. Identify the row containing \"joe lauzon\":\n   - The table lists fighters in the first column.\n   - Find where \"joe lauzon\" appears. This corresponds to the first entry in the data array, which is at `row_index 0`.\n\n2. Check the number of knockouts for Joe Lauzon:\n   - In row 0 (where \"joe lauzon\" is located), look at the value under the column named \"knockouts of the night.\"\n   - According to the table data, the value in this cell is `1`.\n\n3. Compare with the claim:\n   - The claim states Joe Lauzon has 4 knockouts.\n   - The actual number from the table is 1.\n\nSince there's a discrepancy between the claimed number of knockouts (4) and the actual number recorded in the table (1), the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"fighter\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"knockouts of the night\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
