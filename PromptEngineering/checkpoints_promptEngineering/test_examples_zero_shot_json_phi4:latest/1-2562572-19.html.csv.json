This is found at `row_index` 2.\n- Next, we check the population for this row. The \"population (2011)\" value at `row_index` 2 is indeed 1114.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied:\n\n- Settlement name: \"lok\" matches.\n- Population: 1114 matches.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"settlement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"population (2011)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
