This indicates that the Trail Blazers lost.\n\n2. **Check if the Nuggets' record became \"6 - 3\" after this game**:\n   - After verifying the loss, we need to confirm if the Nuggets' record was updated to \"6 - 3\".\n   - The same entry on \"14 November 2007\" shows that the Nuggets' record is indeed listed as \"6 - 3\".\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are satisfied based on the data provided in the table.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- For confirming the Trail Blazers lost to the Nuggets, check the row with \"date\" = \"14 November 2007\", specifically the \"score\" and \"visitor\" columns.\n- To verify the record update, again look at the same row, focusing on the \"record\" column.\n\nThe JSON object reflecting these findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
