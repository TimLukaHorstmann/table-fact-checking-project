This indicates Luis Scola had 14 rebounds in game 76.\n   - We need to ensure no other player has more than 14 rebounds for this specific game.\n\n4. **Verify Against Other Games**:\n   - Since the claim is specifically about game 76, we only need to verify within that row and not across other games.
