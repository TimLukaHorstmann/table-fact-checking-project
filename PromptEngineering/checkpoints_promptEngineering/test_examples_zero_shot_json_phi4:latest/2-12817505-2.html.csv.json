Therefore, the answer is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells from the table are those containing information about the matches with Portsmouth and their results:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"result f - a\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"result f - a\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
