    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze it step-by-step against the provided table.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"there be no defensive end pick and an overall smaller than 2.\"\n\nThis means we need to check two conditions:\n1. There should not be any row where the position is \"defensive end\" and the overall pick number is less than 2.\n2. If such a row exists, the claim would be FALSE; otherwise, it would be TRUE.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n#### Condition 1: Check for \"defensive end\" with \"overall\" < 2\n- We need to identify rows where the position is \"defensive end.\"\n- For each of these rows, check if the overall pick number is smaller than 2.\n\n#### Table Examination:\nLet's examine the table data:\n\n1. **Row 0**: \n   - Position: \"linebacker\" (not relevant)\n   - Overall: 2\n\n2. **Row 1**:\n   - Position: \"defensive end\"\n   - Overall: 33 (greater than 2, so not violating the condition)\n\n3. **Row 2** to **Row 9**: \n   - None of these rows have the position \"defensive end.\"\n\nFrom this examination, we see that there is no row where the position is \"defensive end\" and the overall pick number is less than 2.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince there are no rows violating the condition specified in the claim, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are those containing \"position\" and \"overall\" values for each row. Specifically, we need to check:\n\n- Row 1 (since it has a \"defensive end\"):\n  - Column: \"position\"\n  - Column: \"overall\"\n\nHere is the JSON response with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
