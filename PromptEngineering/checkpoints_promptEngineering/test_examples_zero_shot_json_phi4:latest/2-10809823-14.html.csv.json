    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to verify whether the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) was indeed not the venue with the highest crowd participation during the 1980 VFL season, based on the data provided in the table.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**:\n   - The claim states: \"during the 1980 vfl season, mcg be not the venue with the highest crowd participation.\"\n   - This means we need to check if the MCG had the highest number of attendees compared to other venues listed.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - We are interested in two columns for this verification: \"venue\" and \"crowd\".\n   - Specifically, we need to compare the crowd numbers associated with each venue mentioned.\n\n3. **Extracting Data from the Table**:\n   - From the table provided, we identify the rows containing the MCG as follows:\n\n     ```\n     [\n       [\"richmond\", \"9.19 (73)\", \"collingwood\", \"7.22 (64)\", \"mcg\", 64054, \"28 june 1980\"]\n     ]\n     ```\n\n   - This shows that on 28 June 1980, the game at MCG had a crowd of 64,054.\n\n4. **Comparing Crowd Numbers**:\n   - We now compare this number with other venues from the data:\n\n     ```\n     [\n       [\"geelong\", \"13.6 (84)\", \"north melbourne\", \"4.3 (27)\", \"kardinia park\", 21555],\n       [\"footscray\", \"10.13 (73)\", \"melbourne\", \"6.7 (43)\", \"western oval\", 11785],\n       [\"hawthorn\", \"21.17 (143)\", \"fitzroy\", \"8.7 (55)\", \"princes park\", 8209],\n       [\"south melbourne\", \"5.9 (39)\", \"carlton\", \"10.18 (78)\", \"lake oval\", 12362],\n       [\"st kilda\", \"7.11 (53)\", \"essendon\", \"6.12 (48)\", \"vfl park\", 20485]\n     ]\n     ```\n\n   - The crowd numbers for these venues are: Kardinia Park (21,555), Western Oval (11,785), Princes Park (8,209), Lake Oval (12,362), and VFL Park (20,485).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - MCG's crowd of 64,054 is higher than the crowds for all other venues listed in the data.\n   - Therefore, the claim \"mcg be not the venue with the highest crowd participation\" is false.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells to check are those containing the crowd numbers and the venue name \"MCG\".\n\nThe JSON object with the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
