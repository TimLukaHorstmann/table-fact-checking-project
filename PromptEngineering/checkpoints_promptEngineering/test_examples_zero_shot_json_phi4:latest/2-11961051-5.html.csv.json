The claim states that the points scored by the Pacers should be no greater than 129 and no less than 72.\n\nThe relevant column is \"score,\" as it contains the game results where the first value represents the score of the visiting team, and the second value represents the score of the home team (the Pacers).\n\nHere's how we assess each row:\n\n1. **Row Index 0**: \n   - Score: \"90 - 72\" \n   - Pacers' score as visitors: 90\n\n2. **Row Index 1**:\n   - Score: \"91 - 113\"\n   - Pacers' score as home team: 113\n\n3. **Row Index 2**:\n   - Score: \"96 - 112\"\n   - Pacers' score as home team: 112\n\n4. **Row Index 3**:\n   - Score: \"89 - 111\"\n   - Pacers' score as home team: 111\n\n5. **Row Index 4**:\n   - Score: \"122 - 129\"\n   - Pacers' score as home team: 129\n\n6. **Row Index 5**:\n   - Score: \"111 - 105\"\n   - Pacers' score as home team: 111\n\n7. **Row Index 6**:\n   - Score: \"101 - 106\"\n   - Pacers' score as home team: 106\n\n8. **Row Index 7**:\n   - Score: \"117 - 125\"\n   - Pacers' score as visitors: 117\n\n9. **Row Index 8**:\n   - Score: \"110 - 104\"\n   - Pacers' score as visitors: 104\n\n10. **Row Index 9**:\n    - Score: \"110 - 103\"\n    - Pacers' score as home team: 110\n\n11. **Row Index 10**:\n    - Score: \"95 - 108\"\n    - Pacers' score as home team: 108\n\n12. **Row Index 11**:\n    - Score: \"92 - 104\"\n    - Pacers' score as home team: 104\n\n13. **Row Index 12**:\n    - Score: \"96 - 98\"\n    - Pacers' score as home team: 96\n\n14. **Row Index 13**:\n    - Score: \"110 - 104\"\n    - Pacers' score as visitors: 104\n\nNow, we determine the minimum and maximum scores scored by the Pacers across all games:\n\n- Minimum score: 72 (visitor game on 2 January 2008)\n- Maximum score: 129 (home game on 9 January 2008)\n\nThe claim states that the points should be no greater than 129 and no less than 72.
