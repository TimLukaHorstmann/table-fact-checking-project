Finish\" columns to see if they contain any information or indicate a lack thereof.\n\n3. **Row-by-Row Analysis:**\n\n   - **Row 0 (1967-68):**\n     - \"Conference\": The cell is empty.\n     - \"Conf. Finish\": The cell is also empty.\n     - Conclusion: No conference information available for this season.\n\n   - **Row 1 (1968-69):**\n     - \"Conference\": The cell is empty.\n     - \"Conf. Finish\": The cell is also empty.\n     - Conclusion: No conference information available for this season.\n\n   - **Row 2 (1969-70):**\n     - \"Conference\": The cell contains the value \"SW\" which indicates the Southwest Conference.\n     - \"Conf. Finish\": This cell is empty, indicating no specific finish position was recorded.\n     - Conclusion: While a conference name is available, there's no detailed finishing information.\n\n4. **Determine Support for the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that there is no conf and conf finish information for these seasons.\n   - For rows 0 and 1, both \"Conference\" and \"Conf. Finish\" are empty, fully supporting the claim.\n   - For row 2, while the \"Conference\" cell contains \"SW\", indicating some conference information is present, the \"Conf. Finish\" remains empty. This partially supports the claim since there's no finish position specified.\n\n5. **Final Decision:**\n   - The claim states \"no conf and conf finish information.\" Given that row 2 has some conference information (\"SW\"), the claim cannot be fully supported.\n   \nTherefore, based on the analysis above:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Conference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Conf. Finish\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Conference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Conf. Finish\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Conference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Conf. Finish\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
