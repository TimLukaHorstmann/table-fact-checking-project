    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify if the attendance at the final match was higher than at any other match listed in the provided data for the 2008-09 Manchester United FC season.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - The relevant column for checking attendance figures is \"attendance.\"\n\n2. **Extract Attendance Figures:**\n   - Extract attendance numbers from each row:\n     - Round \"first knockout round first leg\" against Internazionale (Away): 80,018\n     - Round \"first knockout round second leg\" against Internazionale (Home): 74,769\n     - Round \"quarter-final first leg\" against Porto (Home): 74,517\n     - Round \"quarter-final second leg\" against Porto (Away): 50,010\n     - Round \"semi-final first leg\" against Arsenal (Home): 74,733\n     - Round \"semi-final second leg\" against Arsenal (Away): 59,867\n     - Final against Barcelona: 62,467\n\n3. **Compare Attendance of the Final with Other Games:**\n   - The highest attendance among non-final games is 80,018 (first knockout round first leg).\n   - The final game had an attendance of 62,467.\n\n4. **Determine if Claim is TRUE or FALSE:**\n   - Since 80,018 (attendance for the \"first knockout round first leg\" against Internazionale) is greater than 62,467 (attendance for the final), the claim that the final had a higher attendance than any other game is false.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - The cells relevant to verifying this claim are those in the \"attendance\" column for all rows, as they need to be compared to determine if the final indeed had the highest attendance.\n   - Row indices and corresponding column names for these cells:\n     - Row 0: Attendance = 80,018\n     - Row 1: Attendance = 74,769\n     - Row 2: Attendance = 74,517\n     - Row 3: Attendance = 50,010\n     - Row 4: Attendance = 74,733\n     - Row 5: Attendance = 59,867\n     - Row 6 (Final): Attendance = 62,467\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE. The relevant cells are all those in the \"attendance\" column across every row.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
