Western Oval: 16,998\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"mcg venue have 2cd most attendence in the 1965 season.\"\n   - From our sorted list, MCG is ranked 4th in attendance, not 2nd.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false because MCG does not have the second-highest attendance; it has the fourth-highest. \n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- We need to consider all rows for both \"venue\" and \"crowd\" columns to determine the ranking of attendances.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
