    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if there is a player in the table who is from \"norfolk state\" and wears jersey number(s) \"51\". Let's break down the relevant steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Column Names**:  \n   - From the table structure, the columns are \"player\", \"nationality\", \"jersey number (s)\", \"position\", \"years\", and \"from\".\n\n2. **Focus on Relevant Columns for the Claim**:\n   - The claim involves two specific pieces of information: \n     - \"from\" column to find the player from \"norfolk state\".\n     - \"jersey number (s)\" column to check if that player wears jersey number(s) \"51\".\n\n3. **Scan the Data**:  \n   - Go through each row in the data array and extract values for the \"from\" and \"jersey number (s)\" columns.\n\n4. **Check Each Row**:\n   - For each row, verify if the value in the \"from\" column is \"norfolk state\".\n   - If it matches, check if the value in the \"jersey number (s)\" column includes \"51\".\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - In the data provided, we find that the player \"david pope\" has:\n     - \"from\": \"norfolk state\"\n     - \"jersey number (s)\": \"51\"\n\n6. **Conclusion**:  \n   - The conditions in the claim are fully met by the row corresponding to \"david pope\". Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n7. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells for verification are found in the row where:\n     - Column \"from\" has the value \"norfolk state\".\n     - Column \"jersey number (s)\" has the value \"51\".\n\n8. **Determine Row Index**:\n   - In the data array, \"david pope\" is at index 10.\n\nBased on this analysis, the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"jersey number (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"from\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
