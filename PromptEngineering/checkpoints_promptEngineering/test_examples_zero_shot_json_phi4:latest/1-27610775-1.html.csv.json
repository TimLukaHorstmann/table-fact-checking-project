The relevant data points in the table for each episode include the \"title\" and the corresponding \"us viewers (millions)\" value.\n\nThe claim specifies that the episode titled \"That's so not Raven\" has 7.1 million US viewers, which is claimed to be the highest number.\n\nSteps:\n1. Locate the row where the title matches \"That's so not Raven.\"\n2. Verify its US viewership count.\n3. Compare this viewership count with all other episodes in the table to determine if it is indeed the highest.\n\nHere are the steps performed:\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the row for \"That's so not Raven\":\n  - The episode titled \"That's so not Raven\" appears at `row_index` 8.\n  - In this row, the \"us viewers (millions)\" value is 7.1.\n\n- **Step 2**: Verify if 7.1 million US viewers is the highest:\n  - Check all other rows for their respective \"us viewers (millions)\" values.\n  - The maximum viewership count among other episodes is 5.5 million (\"Four 's a Crowd\").\n\nSince no other episode has more than 7.1 million US viewers, \"That's so not Raven\" indeed has the highest number of US viewers.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- Row 8, column \"title\" for the title check.\n- Row 8, column \"us viewers (millions)\" for the viewership count.\n- Other rows' \"us viewers (millions)\" columns to ensure no other episode surpasses this number.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.

Verify that the episode titled \"that's so not raven\" has a US viewership of 7.1 million.\n2. Check if 7.1 million is indeed the lowest viewership figure in the dataset.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification\n\n#### Part 1: Verify Viewership for \"that's so not raven\"\n\n- **Episode Title**: We need to find the row with the title \"that's so not raven\".\n- **US Viewers (millions)**: Check if the viewership is 7.1 million.\n\nFrom the table:\n- The episode titled \"that's so not raven\" is found at `row_index` 8.\n- In this row, under the column \"us viewers (millions)\", we see the value is indeed **7.1**.\n\n#### Part 2: Check if 7.1 million is the lowest viewership\n\nWe need to compare 7.1 against all other values in the \"us viewers (millions)\" column to confirm it is the lowest.\n\nFrom the table, the viewership figures are:\n- 2.9\n- 4.5\n- 4.1\n- 3.6\n- 5.5\n- 3.8\n- 2.4\n- **7.1**\n- 1.9\n- 2.4\n- 2.9\n- 2.7\n- 3.7\n- 4.3\n- 4.9\n- 5.0\n- 4.6\n- 4.3\n- 4.27\n- 3.65\n\nThe lowest viewership value is **1.9** million (from the episode \"blue in the face\" at `row_index` 9), not 7.1.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince 7.1 million is not the lowest viewership number, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n- The cell with \"us viewers (millions)\" for \"that's so not raven\" (`row_index`: 8).\n- All cells under \"us viewers (millions)\" to identify the minimum value.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The relevant information for this task can be found in two columns: \"title\" and \"directed by\".\n\n1. **Locate the episode \"blue in the face\":**\n   - From the table, we find that \"blue in the face\" corresponds to row 9.\n   - In this row, under the column \"directed by\", it is listed as \"Sean McNamara\".\n   - Therefore, Sean McNamara directed \"blue in the face\".\n\n2. **Locate the episode \"skunk'd\":**\n   - From the table, we find that \"skunk'd\" corresponds to row 16.\n   - In this row, under the column \"directed by\", it is listed as \"Christopher B Pearson\".\n   - Therefore, Sean McNamara did not direct \"skunk'd\".\n\nThe claim states that Sean McNamara directed both episodes.

However, based on our examination:\n- Both episodes actually have 4.3 million US viewers, not 4.6 million as claimed.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because neither episode has 4.6 million US viewers; they both have 4.3 million.\n\nNow, let's compile the relevant cells that were checked to verify this claim:\n\n- For \"a goat 's tale\" (row 35), we looked at:\n  - Column: \"us viewers (millions)\"\n  \n- For \"the road to audition\" (row 39), we also looked at:\n  - Column: \"us viewers (millions)\"\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 39, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
