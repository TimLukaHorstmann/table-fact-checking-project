The visitor team should be \"NY Rangers.\"\n\nWe will locate these details in the relevant columns of the provided data.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n- **Check for Date:**\n  - Locate the row where the \"date\" column is \"February 24.\" This corresponds to `row_index` 10.\n\n- **Check for Visitor Team:**\n  - In the same row (`row_index` 10), check the \"visitor\" column. It should be \"NY Rangers.\"\n\n### Verification:\n\n1. For `row_index` 10:\n   - The \"date\" is \"February 24.\"\n   - The \"visitor\" is \"NY Rangers.\"\n\nBoth conditions match, confirming that the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row index: 10\n- Column names: \"date\" and \"visitor\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if on February 24, the visitor team was indeed Winnipeg when Vancouver played at home.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant row:**\n   - The claim specifies \"February 24\" as the date.\n   - Look for a row with \"date\" equal to \"february 24\".\n\n2. **Check the visitor team:**\n   - In the identified row, check the value in the \"visitor\" column.\n   - Verify if this value is \"winnipeg\".\n\n3. **Verify the home team and decision:**\n   - Ensure that the \"home\" team is \"vancouver\".\n   - Confirm the decision by checking if it matches with the expected pattern (though not directly related to the claim, it's useful for consistency).\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n- Locate the row where \"date\" is \"february 24\":\n  - This corresponds to the 11th row in zero-based indexing.\n\n- Check the \"visitor\" column in this row:\n  - The value is \"ny rangers\", not \"winnipeg\".\n\n- Confirm the \"home\" team and decision for consistency:\n  - The \"home\" team is indeed \"vancouver\".\n  - The decision was made by \"whitmore\".\n\nSince the visitor on February 24 was \"ny rangers\" and not \"winnipeg\", the claim is false.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
