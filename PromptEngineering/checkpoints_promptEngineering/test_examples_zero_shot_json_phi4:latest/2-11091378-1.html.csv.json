    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify specific details in the given table:\n\n### Claim Analysis\n\nThe claim states: \"on january 29, at oakland, the standing be 3rd\".\n\nThis involves checking three conditions:\n1. The event took place on January 29.\n2. The location of the event was Oakland.\n3. The standing after this event was 3rd.\n\n### Relevant Table Details\n\nThe table is structured with columns \"round\", \"date\", \"place\", \"finished\", \"total points\", and \"standing\". Each row in the data represents a different round:\n\n#### Step-by-step Verification\n\n1. **Date Check**: We need to find the row where the date matches \"january 29\".\n2. **Location Check**: In this row, verify if the place is \"oakland\".\n3. **Standing Check**: Finally, confirm that the standing for this row is \"3rd\".\n\n#### Locating the Relevant Row\n\n- From the data provided:\n  - The entry with date \"january 29\" is found in the fourth row (index 4).\n  \n  Let's verify each condition:\n\n1. **Date Verification**:\n   - In row index 4, the \"date\" column shows \"january 29\", which matches our claim.\n\n2. **Location Verification**:\n   - In row index 4, the \"place\" column is \"oakland\", which also matches our claim.\n\n3. **Standing Verification**:\n   - In row index 4, the \"standing\" column is \"3rd\", matching the claimed standing after the event at Oakland on January 29.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data in row index 4. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are:\n- Row index 4, Column: \"date\"\n- Row index 4, Column: \"place\"\n- Row index 4, Column: \"standing\"\n\nHere's the JSON object representing our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"standing\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
