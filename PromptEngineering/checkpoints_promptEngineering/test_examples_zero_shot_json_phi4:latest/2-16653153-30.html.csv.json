    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"gold coast blaze have the best record in the season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table, we need to analyze the relevant data columns that indicate a team's performance:\n\n1. **Lost**: Fewer losses generally indicate better performance.\n2. **Last 5**: A higher number of wins in the last five games indicates recent strong performance.\n3. **Streak**: Winning streaks suggest positive momentum.\n4. **% pts (% points)**: Higher percentage indicates more effective scoring and possibly a stronger overall record.\n5. **% won**: Higher winning percentage directly reflects better overall performance.\n\nLet's evaluate each team based on these criteria:\n\n- **South Dragons**:\n  - Lost: 8\n  - Last 5: 4 - 1\n  - Streak: Won 2\n  - % pts: 110.25\n  - % won: 73.33\n\n- **Melbourne Tigers**:\n  - Lost: 10\n  - Last 5: 3 - 2\n  - Streak: Lost 1\n  - % pts: 106.47\n  - % won: 66.67\n\n- **New Zealand Breakers**:\n  - Lost: 12\n  - Last 5: 2 - 3\n  - Streak: Won 2\n  - % pts: 106.08\n  - % won: 60.0\n\n- **Perth Wildcats**:\n  - Lost: 13\n  - Last 5: 4 - 1\n  - Streak: Won 2\n  - % pts: 102.06\n  - % won: 56.67\n\n- **Townsville Crocodiles**:\n  - Lost: 13\n  - Last 5: 4 - 1\n  - Streak: Lost 1\n  - % pts: 99.26\n  - % won: 56.67\n\n- **Adelaide 36ers**:\n  - Lost: 15\n  - Last 5: 3 - 2\n  - Streak: Lost 1\n  - % pts: 100.92\n  - % won: 50.0\n\n- **Wollongong Hawks**:\n  - Lost: 19\n  - Last 5: 2 - 3\n  - Streak: Lost 1\n  - % pts: 95.03\n  - % won: 36.67\n\n- **Sydney Spirit**:\n  - Lost: 19\n  - Last 5: 0 - 5\n  - Streak: Lost 8\n  - % pts: 94.51\n  - % won: 36.67\n\n- **Cairns Taipans**:\n  - Lost: 19\n  - Last 5: 1 - 4\n  - Streak: Lost 3\n  - % pts: 93.57\n  - % won: 36.67\n\n- **Gold Coast Blaze**:\n  - Lost: 22 (most losses)\n  - Last 5: 3 - 2\n  - Streak: Won 3\n  - % pts: 93.45\n  - % won: 26.67 (lowest percentage)\n\nUpon evaluation, the Gold Coast Blaze have the most losses and the lowest winning percentage among all teams in the table, which clearly indicates they do not have the best record in the season.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this conclusion are:\n\n- Losses: The \"lost\" column across all rows.\n- Winning Percentage: The \"% won\" column across all rows.\n\nBased on these analyses, here's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"% won\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
