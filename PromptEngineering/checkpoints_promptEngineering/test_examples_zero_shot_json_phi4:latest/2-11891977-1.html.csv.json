The \"category\" column contains \"best lead actress.\"\n2. The \"nominee\" column lists \"Aracely Ar\u00e1mbula.\"\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how to evaluate this claim using the provided data:\n\n- **Step 1**: Locate entries where the category is \"best lead actress.\" From the table, we see there is one entry matching this description:\n  - Row index: 2\n  - Category: best lead actress\n\n- **Step 2**: Check if Aracely Ar\u00e1mbula is listed as the nominee in that row. The same entry at row index 2 shows:\n  - Nominee: aracely ar\u00e1mbula\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied (the category matches and the nominee is correctly listed), the claim is fully supported by the data.\n\nThe relevant cell for this verification is located at:\n\n- Row index: 2\n- Column names involved: \"category\" and \"nominee\"\n\nThus, we conclude that the claim is TRUE.
