In the context of sports rankings, typically only the top three positions win medals (gold for 1st, silver for 2nd, bronze for 3rd).\n\n- **Norbert Schramm** is ranked 4th.\n- **Stephan Bril** is ranked 6th.\n\nNeither Norbert Schramm nor Stephan Bril ranks in the top 3, so they do not win any medals.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth parts of the claim are verified:\n1. West Germany has two competitors (Norbert Schramm and Stephan Bril) within the top 6.\n2. Neither competitor wins a medal because both rank outside the top 3.\n\nThus, the claim is **TRUE**.\n\n#### Relevant Cells for Verification\n\n- **Row 3**: \"norbert schramm\" from \"West Germany\" (Rank 4)\n- **Row 5**: \"stephan bril\" from \"West Germany\" (Rank 6)\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
