    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Ivana Abramovic play with Maria Abramovic only 1 time,\" we need to determine how many times Ivana Abramovic is listed as a partner alongside Maria Abramovic in the data.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- The relevant columns for this check are \"partner\" and \"outcome.\"\n- We will look through each row where Maria Abramovic appears as the partner (in the \"partner\" column).\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown of the analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Maria Abramovic as Partner:**\n   - Row 7: Partner is Maria Abramovic, Outcome is \"runner - up.\"\n   - Row 8: Partner is Stefanie Haidner, Outcome is \"runner - up.\" (Maria Abramovic not listed)\n   - Row 9: Partner is Maria Abramovic, Outcome is \"winner.\"\n   - Row 10: Partner is Maria Abramovic, Outcome is \"runner - up.\"\n   - Row 12: Partner is Maria Abramovic, Outcome is \"runner - up.\"\n   - Row 13: Partner is Maria Abramovic, Outcome is \"runner - up.\"\n   - Row 15: Partner is Hana Sromova, Outcome is \"winner.\" (Maria Abramovic not listed)\n   - Row 16: Partner is Maria Abramovic, Outcome is \"runner - up.\"\n   - Row 17: Partner is Maria Abramovic, Outcome is \"runner - up.\"\n   - Row 18: Partner is Maria Abramovic, Outcome is \"runner - up.\"\n\n2. **Count Instances of Ivana Abramovic as Partner:**\n   - The table does not list an individual named Ivana Abramovic at all in the \"partner\" column.\n   - Therefore, Ivana Abramovic did not play with Maria Abramovic even once.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false because Ivana Abramovic never played with Maria Abramovic. Hence, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Another match on \"16 - jul - 2007\" also lists \"Maria Abramovic\" as the partner.\n\n3. **Verify Claim:**\n   - In both occurrences, the partner is \"Maria Abramovic,\" not \"Ivana Abramovic.\" Hence, Ivana Abramovic did not play in either of these matches in Mexico City.\n   \n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there are no entries where \"Ivana Abramovic\" is listed as a partner for a tournament held in Mexico City, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n### Relevant Rows:\n- The relevant cells are those that correspond to the tournaments in Mexico City and the partners associated with them.\n  \nHere's the JSON representation of our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
