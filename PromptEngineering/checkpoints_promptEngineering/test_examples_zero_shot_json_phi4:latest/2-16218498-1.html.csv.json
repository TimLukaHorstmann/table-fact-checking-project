    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the scores from the \"1st leg\" column in the provided table. The goal is to identify if more than two teams have the same score during this match.\n\nLet's examine each row for the \"1st leg\" results:\n\n1. **Row 0**: botswana defence force xi vs mbabane highlanders - Score: 1 - 1\n2. **Row 1**: arsenal (maseru) vs eleven arrows fc - Score: 3 - 0\n3. **Row 2**: cd el\u00e1 nguema vs primeiro de agosto - Score: 2 - 3\n4. **Row 3**: lprc oilers vs mighty blackpool - Score: 1 - 0\n5. **Row 4**: asc police vs as real bamako - Score: 1 - 1\n6. **Row 5**: port autonome vs sporting clube da praia - Score: 0 - 0\n7. **Row 6**: saint-george sa vs al ittihad - Score: 2 - 1\n8. **Row 7**: saint-louis fc vs young africans - Score: 1 - 3\n9. **Row 8**: sahel sc vs postel sport - Score: 2 - 1\n10. **Row 9**: tourbillon fc vs forces arm\u00e9es ca - Score: 0 - 0\n\nNow, we count the occurrences of each score:\n\n- **1 - 1** occurs in Row 0 and Row 4 (2 teams)\n- **3 - 0** occurs in Row 1 (1 team)\n- **2 - 3** occurs in Row 2 (1 team)\n- **1 - 0** occurs in Row 3 (1 team)\n- **0 - 0** occurs in Row 5 and Row 9 (2 teams)\n- **2 - 1** occurs in Row 6 and Row 8 (2 teams)\n- **1 - 3** occurs in Row 7 (1 team)\n\nThe scores \"1 - 1\", \"0 - 0\", and \"2 - 1\" each occur twice. No score appears more than twice, so there are no more than two teams with the same \"1st leg\" score.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
