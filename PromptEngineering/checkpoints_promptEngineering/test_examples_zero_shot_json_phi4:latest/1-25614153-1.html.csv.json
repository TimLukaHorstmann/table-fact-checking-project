    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine if exactly one song from the album titled \"This Is Our God\" is included in a different context or collection (implied by \"con todo\"). The claim essentially asks us to verify that only one of these songs appears elsewhere.\n\nFirst, let's identify all songs from the album \"This Is Our God\":\n\n1. Row 1: Song \"para exaltarte\", Album \"this is our god\"\n2. Row 2: Song \"correr\u00e9\", Album \"this is our god\"\n3. Row 5: Song \"canci\u00f3n del desierto\", Album \"this is our god\"\n4. Row 10: Song \"poderoso\", Album \"this is our god\"\n\nNext, we need to check if any of these songs appear in a different album:\n\n- Check for the song \"para exaltarte\" (Row 1):\n  - The original album is \"this is our god\". It does not appear under any other album.\n\n- Check for the song \"correr\u00e9\" (Row 2):\n  - The original album is \"this is our god\". It does not appear under any other album.\n\n- Check for the song \"canci\u00f3n del desierto\" (Row 5):\n  - The original album is \"this is our god\". It does not appear under any other album.\n\n- Check for the song \"poderoso\" (Row 10):\n  - The original album is \"this is our god\". It does not appear under any other album.\n\nNone of these songs appear in a different album, meaning none are included elsewhere (\"con todo\"). Therefore, the claim that only one song from \"This Is Our God\" appears in another context is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are those that contain the information about the original album for each song listed above:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original album\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original album\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"original album\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"original album\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to verify two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. Identify the worship leaders who feature on multiple songs.\n2. Check if Reuben Morgan, Jad Gillies, and Darlene Zschech are the only ones doing so.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Worship Leaders on Multiple Songs\n\nWe will look at the \"worship leader\" column to find which worship leaders appear more than once in the table.\n\n- **Reuben Morgan** appears in rows:\n  - Row 6 (Worship Leader)\n  - Row 8 (Worship Leader)\n  - Row 12 (Joint Worship Leader with Darlene Zschech)\n\n- **Jad Gillies** appears in rows:\n  - Row 4 (Worship Leader)\n  - Row 10 (Worship Leader)\n\n- **Darlene Zschech** appears in rows:\n  - Row 3 (Worship Leader)\n  - Row 6 (Supporting Vocal)\n  - Row 8 (Supporting Vocal)\n  - Row 12 (Joint Worship Leader with Reuben Morgan)\n\n### Step 2: Check Other Potential Candidates\n\nWe need to ensure no other worship leaders appear on multiple songs.\n\n- **Joel Houston** appears only in row 1.\n- **Toni Romero** appears only in row 2.\n- **Darlene Zschech & Reuben Morgan** (as composers) do not count as they are listed under \"composer,\" not \"worship leader.\"\n- **Dave Ware** appears only in row 7.\n- **Matt Crocker** appears only in row 9.\n- **Brooke Fraser** appears only in row 11.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nFrom the analysis, Reuben Morgan, Jad Gillies, and Darlene Zschech are indeed the only worship leaders who feature on multiple songs. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim include all rows where these three individuals appear as worship leaders or in joint roles:\n\n- **Reuben Morgan**: Rows 6, 8, 12\n- **Jad Gillies**: Rows 4, 10\n- **Darlene Zschech**: Rows 3, 6, 8, 12\n\nHere is the JSON response with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"worship leader\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"worship leader\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"worship leader\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"worship leader\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"worship leader\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"worship leader\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"supporting vocal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"supporting vocal\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
