    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"segment c for netflix s07e05 show as sandwich s cookie\" is true or false, we need to verify the following conditions:\n\n1. Check if the \"netflix\" column has the value \"s07e05\" in the row corresponding to \"14 - 05\".\n2. Verify that the \"segment c\" column in this row contains the text \"sandwich s cookie\".\n\nLet's break down these steps using the provided JSON table data:\n\n1. **Locate the Row:**\n   - The claim specifies the series episode as \"14 - 05\". We need to find this entry in the \"data\" array.\n   - According to the given data, row with \"14 - 05\" is:\n     ```json\n     [\n       \"14 - 05\",\n       174,\n       \"s07e05\",\n       \"s surfboard\",\n       \"s sticker\",\n       \"sandwich s cookie\",\n       \"concrete roofing s tile\"\n     ]\n     ```\n\n2. **Check the Netflix Column:**\n   - In this row, the value in the \"netflix\" column is \"s07e05\", which matches the claim.\n\n3. **Verify Segment C:**\n   - The value in the \"segment c\" column for this row is \"sandwich s cookie\".\n   - This matches exactly with what the claim states as the content of segment c.\n\nSince both conditions are met (the episode identifier and the segment content), the claim is supported by the data.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells that were checked include:\n- Row index 4 (\"14 - 05\" corresponds to row_index 4 in zero-based indexing)\n- Column name \"netflix\"\n- Column name \"segment c\"\n\nThe resulting JSON object with the evaluation and relevant cells is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"netflix\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"segment c\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
