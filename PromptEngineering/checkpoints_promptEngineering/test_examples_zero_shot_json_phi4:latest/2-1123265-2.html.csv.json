    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Tarso Marques did not complete any lap\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table in JSON format, we need to examine specific cells in the data.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The statement asserts that Tarso Marques completed zero laps. Therefore, we should focus on finding:\n   - The row corresponding to \"Tarso Marques\".\n   - The value under the \"laps\" column for this driver.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Data**:\n   - We look through the data array in the JSON object for an entry with the driver name \"tarso marques\". This is located at index 20.\n   - Within this row, we check the value of the \"laps\" column to verify how many laps were completed.\n\n3. **Verification Process**:\n   - The relevant cell for verifying the claim is in the row where the driver is \"tarso marques\", specifically under the \"laps\" column.\n   - From the table data provided at index 20, we see that Tarso Marques has a value of 0 laps.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the number of laps completed by Tarso Marques is indeed 0, the claim \"Tarso Marques did not complete any lap\" is fully supported by the data.\n\n5. **Output in JSON Format**:\n   - The answer to whether the claim is true is \"TRUE\".\n   - The relevant cell that verifies this claim is located at row index 20 and column name \"laps\".\n\nHere's the JSON object encapsulating the result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim regarding Tarso Marques in the given table:\n\nThe claim states: \"Tarso Marques starts on grid 13 but does not complete any lap.\"\n\nWe need to verify two conditions:\n1. Tarso Marques' starting position (grid) is indeed 13.\n2. He completed 0 laps.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant data from the table for Tarso Marques:\n\n- **Driver**: \"tarso marques\"\n- **Grid (starting position)**: 21\n- **Laps Completed**: 0\n\nFrom this analysis:\n- The grid position of Tarso Marques is 21, not 13.\n- He completed 0 laps, which matches part of the claim.\n\nSince one condition (the starting grid) does not match the claim, the entire statement is false. We need to identify and list the relevant cells used for this verification:\n\n1. The \"grid\" column in the row corresponding to Tarso Marques verifies his starting position.\n2. The \"laps\" column in the same row verifies that he completed 0 laps.\n\nThe row index for Tarso Marques is the last entry (index 20, zero-based indexing).\n\nThus, the JSON object with our findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
