Identify the relevant information from the claim:\n   - The claim mentions \"rank 7\" and refers to a player named \"Doug Flutie.\"\n   - It states that Doug Flutie has \"58179\" yards.\n\n2. Examine the table for the row corresponding to rank 7:\n   - Look at the row with index `6` (as indexing typically starts from 0 in programming).\n   - Check whether the player's name is \"Doug Flutie.\"\n   - Verify if the \"yardage\" value matches \"58179.\"\n\n3.

Check if this player has the highest completion percentage (comp %) among all players.\n\nLet's break down these steps using the data provided in the JSON format of the table:\n\n### Step 1: Find the Player with 336 Touchdowns\nBy examining the \"touchdowns\" column, we see that Brett Favre is listed as having scored 336 touchdowns. This corresponds to row index 2.\n\n### Step 2: Compare Completion Percentages\nNext, let's compare Brett Favre's completion percentage with those of all other players:\n\n- **Brett Favre**: 62.0% (row index 2)\n- Other players' percentages are:\n  - Anthony Calvillo: 62.4%\n  - Damon Allen: 56.4%\n  - Warren Moon: 58.2%\n  - Peyton Manning: 65.5%\n  - Vinny Testaverde: 56.5%\n  - Drew Bledsoe: 57.2%\n  - Jim Kelly: 60.7%\n  - Joe Montana: 63.2%\n  - Tracy Ham: 54.0%\n\nFrom this comparison, Peyton Manning has a higher completion percentage of 65.5%, which is greater than Brett Favre's 62.0%.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim states that the quarterback with 336 touchdowns also has the highest completion percentage.
