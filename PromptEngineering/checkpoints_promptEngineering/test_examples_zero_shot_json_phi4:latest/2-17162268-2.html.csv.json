    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim: \"Jack Nicklaus of Australia has won the most years, expanded from 1962 to 1980,\" we need to verify two main aspects against the given table:\n\n1. **Check Jack Nicklaus's Country**: The claim states that Jack Nicklaus is from Australia. We must confirm his country in the table.\n2. **Check Number of Years Won by Jack Nicklaus**: The claim asserts he won the most years, specifically from 1962 to 1980. We need to count how many years he won and compare this with other players.\n\nLet's break down these checks:\n\n### Step 1: Verify Jack Nicklaus's Country\n- Locate Jack Nicklaus in the table.\n- Check his country entry.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Row for \"Jack Nicklaus\": `[\"jack nicklaus\", \"united states\", \"1962 , 1972 , 1977 , 1980\", ...]`\n- Column \"country\" shows \"United States,\" not Australia. This already contradicts part of the claim.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Number of Years Won\n- Count Jack Nicklaus's years won from the table.\n- Compare with other players to see if he has indeed won the most years.\n\nFor Jack Nicklaus:\n- Year(s) won: \"1962, 1972, 1977, 1980\" (4 years)\n\nCompare with others:\n- Scott Simpson: 1 year\n- Larry Nelson: 1 year\n- Fuzzy Zoeller: 1 year\n- Raymond Floyd: 1 year\n- Hale Irwin: 3 years (\"1974, 1979, 1990\")\n- Tom Watson: 1 year\n- Andy North: 2 years (\"1978, 1985\")\n- David Graham: 1 year\n\nJack Nicklaus won in 4 different years. No other player has more than 3 wins.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The claim about Jack Nicklaus winning the most years (4) is true.\n- However, claiming he is from Australia is false.\n\nThus, the overall claim is FALSE because of the incorrect country attribution.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row for Jack Nicklaus: `[\"jack nicklaus\", \"united states\", ...]`\n  - Column \"player\": To identify Jack Nicklaus\n  - Column \"country\": To verify his nationality\n  - Column \"year (s) won\": To count the number of years he won\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
