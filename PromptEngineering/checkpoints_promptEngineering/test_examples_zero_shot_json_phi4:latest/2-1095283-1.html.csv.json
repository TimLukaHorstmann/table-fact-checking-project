The field stability of cyanogen bromide.\n2. The effectiveness as a blood agent for cyanogen bromide.\n\nFirstly, identify which row corresponds to cyanogen bromide by matching it with the \"agent\" column values. Cyanogen bromide is listed in the fourth position (index 3) in the data array:\n\n- Row index: 3\n- Agent: \"cyanogen bromide\"\n\nNext, check the relevant columns for this row:\n\n1. **Field Stability**: The column named \"field stability\" should be checked for cyanogen bromide. According to the table:\n   - At row index 3 (cyanogen bromide), the value in the \"field stability\" column is 5.\n\n2. **Effectiveness as Blood Agent**: The column named \"effectiveness as blood agent\" should also be checked.\n   - At row index 3 (cyanogen bromide), the value in the \"effectiveness as blood agent\" column is 9.\n\nBoth conditions stated in the claim match the corresponding values in the table:\n\n- Field stability of cyanogen bromide is indeed 5.\n- Effectiveness as a blood agent for cyanogen bromide is indeed 9.\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by the data provided. The relevant cells that verify this claim are located at row index 3 for both \"field stability\" and \"effectiveness as blood agent\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"field stability\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"effectiveness as blood agent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about cyanogen chloride is true or false, we need to evaluate the two specific conditions mentioned in the claim against the data provided in the table.\n\n1. **Persistence, Open Area:** The claim states that for cyanogen chloride, this value should be 3.\n2. **Field Stability:** The claim states that for cyanogen chloride, this value should be 10.\n\nLet's verify these values from the JSON table:\n\n- First, identify the row corresponding to \"cyanogen chloride\". This is the third entry in the data array (index 2 since indexing starts at 0).\n  \n- In the identified row:\n  - The column for \"persistence , open area\" has a value of 3.\n  - The column for \"field stability\" has a value of 9.\n\nNow, compare these values to the claim:\n\n- The persistence, open area value is correctly claimed as 3.\n- However, the field stability value in the table is 9, not 10 as claimed.\n\nSince one part of the claim does not match the data from the table (field stability), the entire claim is false.\n\nFinally, we list the relevant cells that were checked:\n\n- \"persistence , open area\" at row index 2\n- \"field stability\" at row index 2\n\nHere is the JSON response with the result and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"persistence , open area\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"field stability\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
