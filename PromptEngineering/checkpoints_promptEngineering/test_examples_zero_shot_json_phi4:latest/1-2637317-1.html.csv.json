    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim regarding the Lambayeque region's change in percentage of the country's population since 1993, we need to follow a structured approach.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - The claim specifically mentions \"Lambayeque region\" and states that there is a \"0.0 change in % of the country\u2019s population since 1993.\"\n   - Therefore, we must locate this row in the table and check the corresponding column for \"% of countrys population change since 1993.\"\n\n2. **Locate the Row:**\n   - The region name to be checked is \"Lambayeque.\" By examining the data array, we find that Lambayeque appears as a separate entry:\n     ```json\n     [\n       \"lambayeque\",\n       1091535,\n       4.2,\n       \"175567\",\n       \"0.0\"\n     ]\n     ```\n   - This corresponds to row index 14 in the data array (considering zero-based indexing).\n\n3. **Check the Relevant Column:**\n   - The column of interest is \"% of countrys population change since 1993,\" which is indexed as \"change in % of countrys population since 1993\" under the columns list.\n   - For Lambayeque, this value is indeed listed as \"0.0.\"\n\n4. **Validate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the change in percentage of the country's population for the Lambayeque region is \"0.0.\"\n   - Based on our inspection, the cell at row index 14 and the column \"% of countrys population change since 1993\" confirms this value as \"0.0.\"\n\nSince the table data supports the claim that the Lambayeque region has a \"0.0\" change in percentage of the country's population since 1993, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"change in % of countrys population since 1993\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
