    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Ireland's medal count is true or false, we need to examine the relevant row in the table and check specific conditions.\n\nThe claim states: \"Ireland scored only 1 silver medal and no other medal.\" This means that for the entry corresponding to Ireland:\n- The number of gold medals should be 0.\n- The number of bronze medals should also be 0.\n- The total number of medals should match the sum of gold, silver, and bronze medals.\n\nLet's locate Ireland in the table:\n\n1. Identify the row index for \"ireland\" from the data array:\n   - Looking through the list, we find that Ireland is at row index 32 (considering 0-based indexing).\n\n2. Check the relevant columns for this row to verify the claim:\n   - The \"gold\" column should have a value of 0.\n   - The \"silver\" column should have a value of 1.\n   - The \"bronze\" column should have a value of 0.\n   - Finally, the \"total\" column should equal the sum of gold, silver, and bronze medals (which is 1 in this case).\n\nBy examining these cells for Ireland:\n\n- Row index: 32\n  - \"gold\": 0 (Matches claim)\n  - \"silver\": 1 (Matches claim)\n  - \"bronze\": 0 (Matches claim)\n  - \"total\": 1 (Matches the sum of gold, silver, and bronze)\n\nSince all conditions specified in the claim are met by the data in the table for Ireland, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\nHere's the JSON output with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
