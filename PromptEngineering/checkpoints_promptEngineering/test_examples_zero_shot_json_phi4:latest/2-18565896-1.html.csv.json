    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two conditions based on the table data:\n\n1. **Gold Medals Comparison**: Germany should have won 5 more gold medals than Great Britain.\n2. **Silver Medals Comparison**: Germany should have won 3 more silver medals than Great Britain.\n\nLet's analyze each condition using the relevant data from the table:\n\n### Gold Medals\n\n- **Germany**: According to row 4, Germany has won 5 gold medals.\n- **Great Britain**: According to row 10 (ranked as 9 due to a tie), Great Britain has won 1 gold medal.\n\nNow, calculate the difference in gold medals between Germany and Great Britain:\n\\[ \\text{Gold Medals Difference} = 5 - 1 = 4 \\]\n\nThe claim states that Germany should have 5 more gold medals than Great Britain. However, the actual difference is 4, not 5.\n\n### Silver Medals\n\n- **Germany**: According to row 4, Germany has won 3 silver medals.\n- **Great Britain**: According to row 10 (ranked as 9 due to a tie), Great Britain has won 0 silver medals.\n\nNow, calculate the difference in silver medals between Germany and Great Britain:\n\\[ \\text{Silver Medals Difference} = 3 - 0 = 3 \\]\n\nThe claim states that Germany should have 3 more silver medals than Great Britain. This condition is satisfied as the actual difference is indeed 3.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor the claim to be true, both conditions must be met. While the silver medal condition is satisfied, the gold medal condition is not (the difference is 4 instead of 5). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nTo verify the claim, we need the following cells from the table:\n\n- **Gold Medals for Germany**: Row index 3, Column \"gold\"\n- **Silver Medals for Germany**: Row index 3, Column \"silver\"\n- **Gold Medals for Great Britain**: Row index 10, Column \"gold\"\n- **Silver Medals for Great Britain**: Row index 10, Column \"silver\"\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to verify two main points:\n\n1. **Poland and Spain didn't win any gold medals.**\n2. **Both Poland and Spain have a total of 5 medals each (comprising silver and bronze).**\n\nLet's break down these verifications using the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Verifying Claim Details:\n#### For Poland:\n- **Gold Medals:** According to the row for Poland, the \"gold\" column has a value of 0. This supports the first part of the claim.\n- **Silver and Bronze Total:** The silver count is 2, and bronze count is 0. Therefore, the total medals (silver + bronze) are \\(2 + 0 = 2\\).\n\n#### For Spain:\n- **Gold Medals:** According to the row for Spain, the \"gold\" column also has a value of 0. This supports the first part of the claim.\n- **Silver and Bronze Total:** The silver count is 2, and bronze count is 3. Therefore, the total medals (silver + bronze) are \\(2 + 3 = 5\\).\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Both Poland and Spain did not win any gold medals (supported by data).\n- However, Poland has a total of 2 medals, not 5 as claimed.\n- Spain has a total of 5 medals, which matches the claim.\n\nSince one part of the claim about Poland having 5 silver and bronze medals is incorrect, the entire claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nTo verify this claim, we need to check specific cells in the table:\n- For **Poland**: \n  - Gold: Row 14, Column \"gold\"\n  - Silver: Row 14, Column \"silver\"\n  - Bronze: Row 14, Column \"bronze\"\n  - Total: Row 14, Column \"total\"\n\n- For **Spain**:\n  - Gold: Row 13, Column \"gold\"\n  - Silver: Row 13, Column \"silver\"\n  - Bronze: Row 13, Column \"bronze\"\n  - Total: Row 13, Column \"total\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
