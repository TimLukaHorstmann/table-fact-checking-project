    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table, we need to verify several conditions in the claim against specific entries within the data.\n\n1. **Location Verification**: The claim mentions \"hoboken, new jersey\" as the location of a school.\n   - We should check the 'location' column for this exact entry: \"hoboken , new jersey\".\n\n2. **Control Type Verification**: The claim states that the school is private.\n   - Check the 'control' column to confirm if it reads \"private\" at the same row where the location matches.\n\n3. **Founded Year Verification**: According to the claim, the school was founded in 1870.\n   - Verify this by checking the 'founded' column for the value 1870 in the corresponding row.\n\nLet's find these entries in the data provided:\n\n- In the dataset:\n  - The entry with location \"hoboken , new jersey\" is found at `row_index` 18. \n  - For this entry, the 'control' column states \"private\".\n  - Additionally, the 'founded' year for this entry is 1870.\n\nAll conditions specified in the claim are satisfied by the data provided in row 18.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify two key pieces of information:\n\n1. Whether there is an institution named \"Stevens Institute for Technology.\"\n2. Whether its location is \"Rapid City, South Dakota.\"\n\nLet's examine the relevant data from the provided JSON table:\n\n- The entry corresponding to \"Stevens Institute of Technology\" is found in row 18 (0-based index). This can be confirmed by matching the institution name exactly.\n  \n- We need to check both the \"school\" and \"location\" columns for this row:\n  - For the school, in row 18, column \"school,\" it states: \"stevens institute of technology.\"\n  - For the location, in row 18, column \"location,\" it says: \"hoboken , new jersey.\"\n\nComparing this information with the claim:\n\n- The claim mentions \"Stevens Institute for Technology,\" which closely matches \"Stevens Institute of Technology.\" This can be considered a minor naming discrepancy but is essentially referring to the same institution.\n  \n- The claim states the location as \"Rapid City, South Dakota,\" while the table indicates that Stevens Institute of Technology is based in \"Hoboken, New Jersey.\"\n\nGiven this analysis, the claim about the location being \"Rapid City, South Dakota\" is incorrect.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the \"air force institute of technology\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify two specific conditions from the table data:\n\n1. The type of control (public or private).\n2. The year it was founded.\n\nThe claim states:\n- \"air force institute of technology be a private institute found in 1889.\"\n\nLet's evaluate each condition based on the provided JSON data:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Relevant Row\nFirst, we find the row corresponding to \"air force institute of technology\":\n\n- **School**: air force institute of technology\n- **Location**: wright - patterson afb , ohio\n- **Control**: public\n- **Type**: dru\n- **Enrollment**: 719\n- **Founded**: 1919\n\nThe relevant row index for \"air force institute of technology\" is `0`.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Control Type\nAccording to the claim, it should be a private institute. However, from the table:\n- **Control** at row index `0` is \"public.\"\n\nThis does not match the claim.\n\n### Step 3: Verify Year Founded\nThe claim states it was founded in 1889. From the table:\n- **Founded** at row index `0` is \"1919.\"\n\nThis also does not match the claim.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth conditions stated in the claim are incorrect based on the data provided:\n\n1. The institute is public, not private.\n2. It was founded in 1919, not 1889.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- \"control\" at row index `0`\n- \"founded\" at row index `0`\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"control\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
