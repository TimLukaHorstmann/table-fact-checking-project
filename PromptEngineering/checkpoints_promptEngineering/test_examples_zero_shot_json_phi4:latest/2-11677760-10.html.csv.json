    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"all 5 players were selected in the NBA draft in the season they were eligible,\" we need to examine each player's entry in the table and verify their eligibility based on typical NBA draft rules.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Understand Draft Eligibility:**\n   - Typically, college basketball players are eligible for the NBA Draft after their junior year or if they turn 22 years old before the draft (one year out of high school rule). Since all players listed attended college and have a specified \"college,\" they were likely drafted after completing at least three years in college.\n\n2. **Analyze Each Player:**\n   - **Alonzo Mourning:** Drafted in 1992. Attended Georgetown, which is consistent with being draft-eligible post-college.\n   - **Chris Jackson:** Drafted in 1990. Attended LSU, fitting the typical eligibility timeline.\n   - **Chris Mills:** Drafted in 1993. Attended Kentucky and Arizona, indicating he was eligible after college.\n   - **Billy Owens:** Drafted in 1991. Attended Syracuse, suggesting draft eligibility post-college.\n   - **Kenny Williams:** Drafted in 1990. Attended Barton CC and Elizabeth City State, implying eligibility after college.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - Each player was drafted at least three years after starting their first listed college (assuming no redshirt seasons), which aligns with typical draft eligibility.\n   - No evidence suggests any of these players were drafted before becoming eligible.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is supported by the data provided, as all players appear to have been selected in a season when they were eligible based on standard NBA draft rules.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to evaluate each part of the claim against the data provided in the table:\n\n1. **Claim**: \"Chris Mills be the tallest player\"\n   - We need to compare the heights listed for each player.\n   - Heights from the table:\n     - Alonzo Mourning: 6 - 10\n     - Chris Jackson: 6 - 0\n     - Chris Mills: 6 - 7\n     - Billy Owens: 6 - 9\n     - Kenny Williams: 6 - 10\n   - Both Alonzo Mourning and Kenny Williams are listed as the tallest at \"6 - 10\". Therefore, Chris Mills (6 - 7) is not the tallest.\n\n2. **Claim**: \"Billy Owens be the shortest player\"\n   - We compare heights again to find the shortest.\n   - The shortest height in the table is for Chris Jackson: 6 - 0. Billy Owens at 6 - 9 is not the shortest.\n\n3. **Claim**: \"Both be select for the NBA\"\n   - We need to verify if both players, Chris Mills and Billy Owens, were selected in the NBA draft.\n   - From the table:\n     - Chris Mills: 1st round - 22nd pick of 1993 draft (cavs)\n     - Billy Owens: 1st round - 3rd pick of 1991 draft (kings)\n   - Both players are indeed listed as selected in an NBA draft.\n\nSince both the conditions about height for Chris Mills and Billy Owens are false, even though the condition regarding their selection in the NBA is true, the overall claim does not hold. Therefore, the answer is \"FALSE\".\n\nWe identify the relevant cells based on these evaluations:\n\n- Heights of all players to check tallest and shortest claims:\n  - Alonzo Mourning (row_index: 0), Chris Jackson (row_index: 1), Chris Mills (row_index: 2), Billy Owens (row_index: 3), Kenny Williams (row_index: 4) in the \"height\" column.\n- NBA draft selections of Chris Mills and Billy Owens to verify their selection:\n  - Chris Mills (row_index: 2), Billy Owens (row_index: 3) in the \"nba draft\" column.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"height\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"height\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"height\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"height\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"height\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
