    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two key aspects from the table:\n\n1. Identify golfers who finished within the top 11 at the 1959 US Open.\n2. Determine if there is only one golfer among these who is not from the United States.\n\nLet's break this down using the provided table data:\n\n- The \"place\" column indicates a player's finishing position, with numbers representing positions (e.g., \"1\") and letters followed by numbers indicating ties (e.g., \"t2\").\n- A top 11 finish would include all rows where \"place\" is less than or equal to \"11\", either as a number or as part of a tie that implies at least sharing the 11th position.\n- The relevant positions from the table are: \n  - Row 0 (\"1\")\n  - Rows 1, 2, and 3 (all marked as \"t2\")\n  - Rows 4 and 5 (both marked as \"t5\")\n  - Rows 6 and 7 (both marked as \"t7\")\n  - Rows 8, 9, and 10 (all marked as \"t9\")\n\nThis includes a total of 11 positions: one for position 1 and ten from the ties.\n\nNext, we check the nationality of each golfer within these rows to see if there's exactly one non-US player:\n\n- Row 0: Billy Casper - United States\n- Row 1: Arnold Palmer - United States\n- Row 2: Gary Player - South Africa (non-US)\n- Row 3: Ben Hogan - United States\n- Row 4: Mike Souchak - United States\n- Row 5: Doug Ford - United States\n- Row 6: Ernie Vossler - United States\n- Row 7: Dow Finsterwald - United States\n- Row 8: Jay Hebert - United States\n- Row 9: Claude Harmon - United States\n- Row 10: Gene Littler - United States\n\nFrom this analysis, Gary Player from South Africa is the only non-US golfer who finished within the top 11.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"there be only 1 golfer not from the us that finish within the top 11 at the 1959 us open\" is TRUE.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to assess the table data and verify if there are indeed ten golfers tied for a place at the end of the 1959 US Open.\n\n**Claim Analysis:**\n\n1. The claim states that \"there be 10 golfer tie for place at the end of the 1959 us open.\"\n2. We need to check how many golfers share the same final position (place) in the table and confirm if this number is ten.\n\n**Steps to Evaluate the Claim:**\n\n- **Identify Tied Positions:** Check each row's \"place\" column for ties.\n- **Count Golfers in Each Tie Group:** Determine how many golfers are tied within each group by examining entries with the same place value (e.g., \"t2\", \"t5\", \"t7\", \"t9\").\n  \n**Relevant Data from Table:**\n\n1. **Place \"1\":**\n   - Billy Casper is alone in this position.\n   - Number of golfers: 1\n\n2. **Place \"t2\" (Tied for 2nd place):**\n   - Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, Ben Hogan\n   - Number of golfers: 3\n\n3. **Place \"t5\" (Tied for 5th place):**\n   - Mike Souchak, Doug Ford\n   - Number of golfers: 2\n\n4. **Place \"t7\" (Tied for 7th place):**\n   - Ernie Vossler, Dow Finsterwald\n   - Number of golfers: 2\n\n5. **Place \"t9\" (Tied for 9th place):**\n   - Jay Hebert, Claude Harmon, Gene Littler\n   - Number of golfers: 3\n\n**Summing Up the Golfers in Ties:**\n\n- Total number of tied positions:\n  - t2: 3 golfers\n  - t5: 2 golfers\n  - t7: 2 golfers\n  - t9: 3 golfers\n  \n- Total number of golfers tied for any place = 3 (t2) + 2 (t5) + 2 (t7) + 3 (t9) = 10\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim that \"there be 10 golfer tie for place at the end of the 1959 us open\" is supported by the table data. Thus, the answer is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
