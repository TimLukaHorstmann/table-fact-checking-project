    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"laurel's division record be 5 - 1\", we need to examine the table provided in JSON format and locate the relevant data for the team from Laurel.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify the Row**: \n   - The first column in the data array represents the school names. We look for \"laurel\" in this list.\n   - From the data:\n     ```json\n     [\n       [\"milford\", \"buccaneers\", \"5 - 1\", \"10 - 2\", \"won div ii state championship\"],\n       [\"laurel\", \"bulldogs\", \"5 - 1\", \"9 - 3\", \"loss in div ii state championship game\"],\n       ...\n     ]\n     ```\n   - We find that the second row (index 1) corresponds to Laurel.\n\n2. **Locate Division Record**:\n   - The third column contains the division record for each team.\n   - For Laurel, located at row index 1, the division record is \"5 - 1\".\n\n3. **Verify Claim Against Table Data**:\n   - The claim states that Laurel's division record is \"5 - 1\".\n   - We have verified from the table data that the division record for Laurel (index 1) is indeed \"5 - 1\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data. Therefore, the answer is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant cell for verifying this claim is found at row index 1 in the column named \"division record\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"division record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the wildcat be from the laurel school\" is true or false, we need to verify the relevant parts of the table.\n\nThe claim involves identifying which team is associated with the \"wildcats\" and then checking if this team belongs to the \"laurel\" school. \n\n1. Locate the row where the \"team\" column contains \"wildcats\". This corresponds to the fourth row in our dataset:\n   - Row index: 3\n   - Data: [\"delmar\", \"wildcats\", \"4 - 2\", \"8 - 2\", \"failed to make playoffs\"]\n\n2. Check the \"school\" column for this row to see which school the \"wildcats\" belong to. In this case, it is \"delmar\".\n\n3. The claim states that the \"wildcat be from the laurel school\". Since we found that the \"wildcats\" are associated with \"delmar\", not \"laurel\", the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells for verifying this claim:\n\n- The cell in row index 3 under the column \"school\" provides information about which school has the wildcats.\n- The cell in row index 3 under the column \"team\" confirms that it is indeed the wildcats we are considering.\n\nThus, the JSON object representing our findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
