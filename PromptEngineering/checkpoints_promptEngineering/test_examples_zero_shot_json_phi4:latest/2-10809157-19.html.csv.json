    "resp": "To verify the claim \"north melbourne's home opponent be st kilda,\" we need to analyze the table data and identify relevant cells:\n\n1. Identify games involving \"north melbourne\" as either the home or away team.\n2. For such a game, check if \"st kilda\" is listed as the opposing (away) team when north melbourne is the home team.\n\nLet's break it down step-by-step:\n\n- The claim involves two teams: \"north melbourne\" and \"st kilda.\"\n- We are interested in games where \"north melbourne\" is playing at home, meaning they should be listed under the \"home team\" column.\n- In such a game, we need to verify if \"st kilda\" appears as the \"away team.\"\n\nNow let's examine the table data:\n\n1. **Row 0:**\n   - Home Team: geelong\n   - Away Team: hawthorn\n\n2. **Row 1:**\n   - Home Team: collingwood\n   - Away Team: south melbourne\n\n3. **Row 2:**\n   - Home Team: carlton\n   - Away Team: richmond\n\n4. **Row 3:**\n   - Home Team: st kilda\n   - Away Team: north melbourne\n   - This row shows that \"st kilda\" is the home team, not \"north melbourne.\"\n\n5. **Row 4:**\n   - Home Team: melbourne\n   - Away Team: fitzroy\n\n6. **Row 5:**\n   - Home Team: footscray\n   - Away Team: essendon\n\nUpon reviewing all rows, we see that there is no game where \"north melbourne\" is the home team and \"st kilda\" is the away team. Instead, in Row 3, \"north melbourne\" is the away team against \"st kilda.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by the data.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row 3, Column \"home team\": \"st kilda\"\n- Row 3, Column \"away team\": \"north melbourne\"\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
