Specifically:\n- Column at index 1 corresponds to \"internet explorer\"\n- Column at index 4 corresponds to \"firefox\"\n\nNow, identify the relevant data point for September 2011:\n- Looking through the dates in the table, we find that September 2011 is the 19th row (index 18 when zero-indexed).\n\nExtracting the data from this row:\n- For \"internet explorer\", at index 18 and column index 1: \"38.85%\"\n- For \"firefox\", at index 18 and column index 4: \"24.98%\"\n\nBoth values match the conditions stated in the claim, confirming that the percentages given are correct.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that the claim is TRUE based on this analysis.\n\nFinally, we return a JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"internet explorer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"firefox\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
