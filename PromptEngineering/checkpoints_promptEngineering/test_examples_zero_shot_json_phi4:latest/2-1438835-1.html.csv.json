    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim based on the provided table data, let's break down each part of the claim and verify it against the relevant data:\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **\"The highest away score be 3 - 1 in the 2001 - 02 season\"**\n   - We need to check if there is any match from the \"2001 - 02\" season where the away team scored 3 goals.\n   - From the data, we have the following matches for the \"2001 - 02\" season:\n     - `[\"matador p\\u00fachov\", \"2 - 1\", \"0 - 0\"]` (Away score is 0)\n     - `[\"st gallen\", \"0 - 1\", \"4 - 1\"]` (Away score is 1)\n     - `[\"feyenoord\", \"2 - 2\", \"0 - 1\"]` (Away score is 1)\n   - The highest away score in the 2001-02 season is 1, not 3. This part of the claim is false.\n\n2. **\"The lowest away score be 0 - 0 on 2 occasions in the 1995 - 96 season and the 2001 - 02 season\"**\n   - We need to check for occurrences where the away team scored 0 goals (i.e., \"0 - X\").\n   - For the \"1995 - 96\" season:\n     - `[\"slavia prague\", \"1 - 2\", \"0 - 0\"]` (Away score is 0)\n     - There is one occurrence of an away score of 0-0.\n   - For the \"2001 - 02\" season:\n     - As listed above, there are two matches where the away score is 0: \n       - `[\"matador p\\u00fachov\", \"2 - 1\", \"0 - 0\"]`\n       - `[\"feyenoord\", \"2 - 2\", \"0 - 1\"]` (This does not count as it's 1-0)\n   - Therefore, there are two occurrences of an away score of 0 in the \"2001 - 02\" season and one in the \"1995 - 96\" season.\n   - This part of the claim is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe first condition about the highest away score being 3-1 is false. The second condition about two occurrences of an away score of 0-0 across both seasons is true, but since not all conditions are met, the entire claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n- For the \"highest away score\" check in the 2001 - 02 season:\n  - Row index 1: `away` column (\"0 - 0\")\n  - Row index 2: `away` column (\"4 - 1\")\n  - Row index 3: `away` column (\"0 - 1\")\n- For the \"lowest away score\" check in the 1995 - 96 season:\n  - Row index 0: `away` column (\"0 - 0\")\n- For the \"lowest away score\" check in the 2001 - 02 season:\n  - Row index 1: `away` column (\"0 - 0\")\n  - Row index 3: `away` column (\"0 - 1\")\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
