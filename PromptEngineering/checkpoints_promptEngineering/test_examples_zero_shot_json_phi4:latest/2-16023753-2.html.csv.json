    "resp": "To verify the claim about the Miami Dolphins' defense recording three shutouts during the 1983 season, we need to examine the results of their games where a shutout could have occurred. A shutout in football means one team did not allow the other team to score any points.\n\n**Steps for verification:**\n\n1. Identify which cells in the table are relevant:\n   - We focus on the \"result\" column because it indicates the game's score, and we need to identify matches where the Dolphins' opponent scored 0 points.\n   \n2. Review each row of data to check for shutouts:\n   - **Week 1:** Result is \"w 12 - 0\". The opponent (Buffalo Bills) was shut out with a score of 0.\n   - **Week 4:** Result is \"w 14 - 6\". No shutout occurred as the opponent (Kansas City Chiefs) scored 6 points.\n   - **Week 6:** Result is \"l 38 - 35\". No shutout occurred as the Dolphins allowed 38 points.\n   - **Week 7:** Result is \"w 32 - 14\". No shutout occurred as the opponent (New York Jets) scored 14 points.\n   - **Week 8:** Result is \"w 21 - 7\". No shutout occurred as the opponent (Baltimore Colts) scored 7 points.\n   - **Week 9:** Result is \"w 30 - 14\". No shutout occurred as the opponent (Los Angeles Rams) scored 14 points.\n   - **Week 10:** Result is \"w 20 - 17\". No shutout occurred as the opponent (San Francisco 49ers) scored 17 points.\n   - **Week 11:** Result is \"l 17 - 6\". No shutout occurred as the Dolphins allowed 17 points.\n   - **Week 12:** Result is \"w 37 - 0\". The opponent (Baltimore Colts) was shut out with a score of 0.\n   - **Week 13:** Result is \"w 38 - 14\". No shutout occurred as the opponent (Cincinnati Bengals) scored 14 points.\n   - **Week 14:** Result is \"w 24 - 17\". No shutout occurred as the opponent (Houston Oilers) scored 17 points.\n   - **Week 15:** Result is \"w 31 - 24\". No shutout occurred as the Dolphins allowed 24 points.\n   - **Week 16:** Result is \"w 34 - 14\". No shutout occurred as the opponent (New York Jets) scored 14 points.\n\n3. Count the number of shutouts:\n   - From the analysis above, the Dolphins recorded shutouts in Weeks 1 and 12. There are only two shutouts, not three as claimed.\n\nBased on this examination, the claim that \"the dolphins' defense record 3 shutout during the 1983 season\" is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- The relevant cells for verifying the claim are all those containing results where we checked for a score of 0 against the Dolphins.
