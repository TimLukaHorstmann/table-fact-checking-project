Therefore, the answer to the claim is \"FALSE.\"\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The cells relevant for verifying this are those in the \"attendance\" column for all dates, but specifically:\n  - October 24 (highest attendance)\n  - October 30 (date mentioned in the claim)\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
