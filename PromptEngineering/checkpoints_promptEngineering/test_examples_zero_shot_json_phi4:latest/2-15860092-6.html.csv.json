However, we need to ensure that this condition holds for any team that played both teams.\n\n### Verification:\n\nWe check if there's any team that has played against both Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Daredevils and satisfies the loss condition:\n- The table does not specify individual team match records against these two teams; it only provides aggregate data.\n- Therefore, we assume the claim refers to a general comparison of losses across all teams.\n\nSince the difference in losses (8 vs. 4) matches the claim's requirement for any team that played both, and no other specific conditions or exceptions are provided, the claim holds true based on the given data.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is supported by the data as it stands.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
