    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant details provided in the claim and compare them with the data available in the table.\n\n### Breakdown of the Claim:\n- **Teams involved:** Blue (Blues) vs. Penguins\n- **Date:** March 20\n- **Score claimed:** Blues 2 - Penguins 4\n\n### Steps for Verification:\n1. **Identify the Date:** We need to find the entry in the table where the date is \"march 20\".\n2. **Verify Teams Involved:** Ensure that one of the teams listed is \"penguins\" and the other is \"blues\".\n3. **Check the Score:** Confirm if the score matches \"2 - 4\", with the first number corresponding to the home team's score.\n\n### Examination of Table:\n- We locate the row in the table with the date \"march 20\":\n  ```json\n  [\n    \"march 20\",\n    \"blues\",\n    \"2 - 4\",\n    \"penguins\",\n    6126,\n    \"23 - 33 - 12\",\n    58\n  ]\n  ```\n- **Date Check:** The date matches as \"march 20\".\n- **Teams Involved:**\n  - Home team: Penguins (as per the table, they are listed under \"home\").\n  - Visitor team: Blues (as per the table, they are listed under \"visitor\").\n- **Score Verification:**\n  - According to the entry, the score is \"2 - 4\". This means:\n    - The Blues scored 2 goals.\n    - The Penguins scored 4 goals.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim states that in the game on March 20 between the Blues and Penguins, the score was \"2 - 4\", which corresponds to the Penguins winning with a score of 4 against the Blues' 2. This matches exactly with what is recorded in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is **TRUE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant cells that verify this are from the row where `date` is \"march 20\". We focus on the columns: \n  - \"visitor\" (Blues)\n  - \"score\" (2 - 4)\n  - \"home\" (Penguins)\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"home\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
