However, based on typical TV show credits and the context provided by the table, it's clear that \"written by\" refers to writing the script or storyline for an episode, not composing music.\n   - There is no mention in the data of songwriting credits, which would typically be separate from writing episodes.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Rob Thomas did write the episode titled \"credit where credit 's due\", but there is no evidence that he wrote a song associated with this title based on the provided table.\n   - Therefore, given the information available and its typical interpretation, the claim about Rob Thomas writing a song is not supported by the data.\n\nHence, the answer to the claim is \"FALSE\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"written by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
