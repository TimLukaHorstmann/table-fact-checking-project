    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two parts of it:\n\n1. Identify if there was a game against the San Diego Chargers before week 6.\n2. Check if the attendance at that game was indeed 13,000.\n\nFirst, examine each entry in the data for games played before week 6 and check their opponents:\n\n- Week 1: Opponent is New York Titans\n- Week 2: Opponent is Dallas Texans\n- Week 3: Opponent is San Diego Chargers (this is a match with the required opponent)\n- Week 4: Opponent is Denver Broncos\n- Week 5: Opponent is Denver Broncos\n\nThe game against the San Diego Chargers occurs in week 3, which is indeed before week 6.\n\nNext, verify the attendance for the San Diego Chargers game:\n\n- In row index 2 (week 3), opponent \"San Diego Chargers\" and \"attendance\" is recorded as 13,000.\n\nBoth conditions from the claim are met: there was a game against the San Diego Chargers before week 6, and its attendance was exactly 13,000. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nHere is the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
