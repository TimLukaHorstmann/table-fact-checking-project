Therefore, this portion of the claim is false.\n  \n- The second part of the claim regarding Wyoming Australia being built \"in\" a certain year(s) does not specify any year but states it was built in \"2011 - 2012.\" Without specific years provided to verify against, we consider only what information is present. However, since no specific year range or single year was claimed for verification and the claim itself is incomplete, this part doesn't provide a clear true/false evaluation.\n\nGiven that one condition of the claim about Whitehaven coal being built in 2006 is false, the entire claim cannot be considered fully supported by the data.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe overall answer to whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE is \"FALSE\" based on the incorrect year stated for Whitehaven coal.
