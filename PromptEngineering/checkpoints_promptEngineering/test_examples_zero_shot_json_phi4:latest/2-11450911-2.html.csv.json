Identify Keiko Tamai's first win.\n2. Check if she experienced two losses immediately after this initial victory.\n\n### Steps for Verification\n\n**Step 1: Locate Keiko Tamai's First Win**\n\n- Examine each row in the \"data\" array and identify when the `res` (result) column shows a \"win.\"\n- The first occurrence of \"win\" will indicate her first match won.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Row 4 has `\"win\", \"14 - 11\", \"jan finney\", \"submission (armbar)\", 2, \"3:01\"` indicating it is her first win as it's the first instance with `res` as \"win.\"\n\n**Step 2: Check for Two Losses After First Win**\n\n- From Row 4 onward, observe subsequent rows to identify instances where the result (`res`) is a \"loss.\"\n- Count consecutive losses following this initial win.\n\nAnalyzing the data from Row 5 onwards:\n- Row 6 has `\"win\", \"13 - 11\", ...`, not a loss.\n- Row 7 has `\"loss\", \"12 - 11\", \"hitomi akano\", ...`, first loss after her first win.\n- Row 9 has `\"loss\", \"11 - 10\", \"megumi fujii\", ...`, second consecutive loss after her first win.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nKeiko Tamai did indeed lose two matches consecutively right after winning her first match. Thus, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Row 4 (First Win): `\"win\", \"14 - 11\", ...`\n- Rows 7 and 9 (Subsequent Losses): \n  - Row 7: `\"loss\", \"12 - 11\", \"hitomi akano\", ...`\n  - Row 9: `\"loss\", \"11 - 10\", \"megumi fujii\", ...`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"res\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

All matches where Keiko Tamia participated and ended with a unanimous decision.\n2.
