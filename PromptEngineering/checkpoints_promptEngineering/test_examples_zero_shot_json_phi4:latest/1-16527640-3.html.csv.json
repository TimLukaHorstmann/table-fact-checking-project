    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"VFL game 9 be hold in New Guinea\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to check if player number 9 (based on a zero-based index) played their VFL games in New Guinea.\n\n1. Identify the row corresponding to player number 9:\n   - In a zero-based index system, this corresponds to the 10th entry in the data list.\n\n2. Check the \"location\" column for player number 9:\n   - The location for this player is \"New Guinea.\"\n\n3. Verify if any VFL games were played by this player in New Guinea:\n   - The player associated with row index 8 (player number 9) has \"alf giblett\" as their name.\n   - They have 9 VFL games listed and are located in New Guinea at the time of death.\n\nSince the player's location is indeed New Guinea, it supports the claim that their VFL game was held there.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Archie Roberts died on June 6, 1945\" is true or false based on the given table, we need to verify two key pieces of information from the data:\n\n1. **Player Name**: We must find the row corresponding to \"Archie Roberts\" in the table.\n2. **Date of Death**: We need to check if the date listed for \"Archie Roberts\" matches \"June 6, 1945\".\n\nLet's break it down step-by-step:\n\n- **Step 1: Locate the Player Name**  \n  We search through the data rows to find where \"player\" is \"archie roberts\". In the table, the player names are listed in the first column of each row.\n\n- **Step 2: Verify the Date of Death**  \n  Once we locate the correct row for \"Archie Roberts\", we check the value in the \"date of death\" column to see if it matches \"6 June 1945\".\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n1. In the data provided, there is a row where the player name is \"archie roberts\":\n   - Row Index: 14 (0-based index)\n   - Player: \"Archie Roberts\"\n   \n2. Check the date of death for this row:\n   - Date of Death: \"6 June 1945\"\n\nThe data confirms that Archie Roberts did indeed die on June 6, 1945.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the table, and we can conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"date of death\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
