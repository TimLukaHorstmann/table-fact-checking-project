    "resp": "To verify the claim about the average attendance for games played in May at the Eternal Derby (Croatia) between Dinamo Zagreb and Croatia Zagreb, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Games:** The claim specifies \"the month of May\" and refers to the Eternal Derby, which involves matches between Dinamo Zagreb and Croatia Zagreb. Therefore, we should focus on games that occur in May at either the Maksimir or Poljud stadium (as these are the venues associated with these teams).\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Data:**\n   - We need to find all games played in May.\n   - Filter out only those matches that involve Dinamo Zagreb and Croatia Zagreb, which means one of the stadiums should be either Maksimir or Poljud.\n\n3. **Calculate Average Attendance:** For each relevant game identified, extract the attendance figure and calculate the average.\n\n4. **Compare with Claimed Value:** The claim states an average attendance of 22,666. We will compare this calculated average to verify if it matches.\n\nNow, let's go through the data:\n\n- **May 2007:** \n  - Game at Maksimir: Attendance = 35,000\n- **May 2008:** \n  - Game at Poljud: Attendance = 10,000\n- **May 2009:** \n  - Game at Maksimir: Attendance = 20,000\n- **May 2010:** \n  - Game at Maksimir: Attendance = 13,000\n\nThese are the relevant games in May involving either Maksimir or Poljud stadium.\n\n**Calculating Average Attendance:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{35,000 + 10,000 + 20,000 + 13,000}{4} = \\frac{78,000}{4} = 19,500\n\\]\n\nThe calculated average attendance for these games is 19,500.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- The claim states the average should be 22,666.\n- Our calculation shows an average of 19,500.\n\nSince the calculated average does not match the claimed value, the statement is false.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n1.
