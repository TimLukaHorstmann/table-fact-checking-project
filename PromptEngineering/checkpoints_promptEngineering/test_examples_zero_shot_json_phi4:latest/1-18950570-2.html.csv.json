    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine if there is a period in which the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) is 43 and verify whether the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) for that period is 2.45.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: We are looking for the row(s) where the IMR equals 43.\n   - Scan through each row's \"imr\" value in the table to find any instance of 43.\n\n2. **Examine Found Row**:\n   - If we find a row with an \"imr\" of 43, check its corresponding \"tfr\" value to see if it is 2.45.\n\n3. **Check Each Row**:\n   - For the period \"1950 - 1955\", IMR = 135\n   - For the period \"1955 - 1960\", IMR = 122\n   - For the period \"1960 - 1965\", IMR = 109\n   - For the period \"1965 - 1970\", IMR = 100\n   - For the period \"1970 - 1975\", IMR = 91\n   - For the period \"1975 - 1980\", IMR = 79\n   - For the period \"1980 - 1985\", IMR = 63\n   - For the period \"1985 - 1990\", IMR = 52\n   - For the period \"1990 - 1995\", IMR = 43\n     - TFR for this period is 2.6, not 2.45.\n   - For the period \"1995 - 2000\", IMR = 34\n   - For the period \"2000 - 2005\", IMR = 27\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The only period with an IMR of 43 is \"1990 - 1995\".\n   - The TFR for this period is 2.6, not 2.45.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE because there is no period where the IMR is 43 and the TFR is 2.45.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"imr\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"tfr\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
