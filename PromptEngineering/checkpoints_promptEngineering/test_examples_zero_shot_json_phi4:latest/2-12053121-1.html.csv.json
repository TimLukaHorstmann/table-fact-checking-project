    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim regarding \"the m moby corse\" entering service in 2010 and having a width of 25 meters, we need to carefully examine the table provided in the JSON format.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row**: We must locate the row that corresponds to \"ms moby corse\". The table indicates multiple rows, each representing a different ship. By examining the data section, we find the entry for \"ms moby corse\" is:\n   - [\"ms moby corse\", 1978, 2010, \"genoa - bastia\", \"gt\", \"152 m\", \"25 m\", 1.2, 450.0, \"21\"]\n\n2. **Check \"Entered Service\" Year**: According to the claim, \"moby corse\" entered service in 2010. In the relevant row for \"ms moby corse\":\n   - The \"entered service\" column is 2010.\n\n3. **Check \"Width\" Measurement**: The claim states that \"moby corse\" has a width of 25 meters. In the same relevant row:\n   - The \"width\" column is listed as \"25 m\".\n\nSince both conditions mentioned in the claim are met by the data in the table (entered service year and width), we can conclude the following:\n\n- **Answer**: TRUE\n\nTo provide the solution in JSON format, we identify the relevant cells from the row where \"ms moby corse\" appears. The specific rows and columns involved are:\n   - Row index: 12 (considering zero-based indexing)\n   - Columns: \"entered service\" for the year 2010, and \"width\" for the value \"25 m\".\n\nThus, the JSON output is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"entered service\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"width\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and conditions, let's carefully analyze each part of the claim:\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n1. **Build Year**: The claim specifies \"1977\" as a build year.\n2. **Enter Service Year**: The enter service year should be more recent than 2003.\n3. **Knots Condition**: The knots value must be less than 27.\n\nWe need to check if there exists any ship built in 1977 that entered service after 2003 and has a knot speed of less than 27.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n1. **Identify Rows with Build Year 1977**:\n   - There are no ships directly listed with the build year \"1977\" in the data provided. However, we notice entries for 1976 and 1978 which might be considered if there's a rounding or entry error, but strictly based on the given information, none exactly matches 1977.\n\n2. **Check Enter Service Year > 2003**:\n   - For any ship that hypothetically could have been built in 1977 (or close years like 1976), we would check if it entered service after 2003.\n\n3. **Knots < 27**:\n   - The knots condition needs to be checked for those ships with enter service year > 2003.\n\n### Detailed Row Examination:\n\n- **Row Index 5 (\"ms moby baby\", built in 1966)**: Enter service is 1996, Knots = 19 (meets knot condition but not the build year or enter service condition).\n- **Row Index 8 (\"ms moby lally\", built in 1974)**: Enter service is 2000, Knots = 17.5 (meets knot condition but not the enter service condition).\n- **Rows with Build Years Close to 1977**:\n  - **Row Index 3 (\"ms moby vincent\", built in 1974)**: Enter service is 1990, Knots = 17.5.\n  - **Row Index 10 (\"ms moby otta\", built in 1976)**: Enter service is 2006, Knots = 27 (does not meet the knots condition).\n  - **Row Index 11 (\"ms moby tommy\", built in 2002)**: Enter service is 2007, Knots = 30.\n  - **Row Index 12 (\"ms moby aki\", built in 2005)**: Enter service is 2005, Knots = 29.\n  \nNone of these rows satisfy all three conditions simultaneously.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- There is no ship that was built in 1977 and entered service after 2003 with knots less than 27.\n- Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\nSince no row satisfies all conditions, we identify cells relevant to checking each part of the claim:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"entered service\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"entered service\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"entered service\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"entered service\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"entered service\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"knots\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"knots\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"knots\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
