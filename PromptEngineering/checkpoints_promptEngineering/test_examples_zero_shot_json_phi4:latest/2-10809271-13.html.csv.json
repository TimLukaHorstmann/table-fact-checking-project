Locate the row containing \"carlton\":\n   - Review each entry under the column \"home team\" to find where Carlton is listed. In this case, it's the third row (index 2).\n\n3. Verify if \"princes park\" is mentioned as the venue for Carlton:\n   - Check the \"venue\" column corresponding to the row where Carlton appears as the home team.\n\n4.
