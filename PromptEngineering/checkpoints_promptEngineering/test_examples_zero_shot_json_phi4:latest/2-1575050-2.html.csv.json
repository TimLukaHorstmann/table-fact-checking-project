    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"the soviet union (urs) scored 2 bronze,\" we must examine the relevant cells in the table provided.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Nation**: The claim specifically mentions the Soviet Union (URS). We need to find this nation in the data section of the table.\n   \n2. **Locate Data for Soviet Union**:\n   - Row corresponding to \"soviet union (urs)\" is identified by checking each entry under the \"nation\" column.\n   - From the data, we find that the row with \"soviet union (urs)\" is at index 4.\n\n3. **Check Bronze Medals**:\n   - We need to verify the value in the \"bronze\" column for this row.\n   - The table shows that for the Soviet Union (URS), the \"bronze\" count is 1.\n\n4. **Compare with Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the Soviet Union scored 2 bronze medals, but according to the table, they scored only 1 bronze medal.\n\nSince the value in the relevant cell does not support the claim of 2 bronze medals, the claim is false.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the total be 2 for bronze\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to evaluate the data in the table focusing on the column labeled \"bronze\" and compare it with the totals provided.\n\n1. **Understanding the Structure:**\n   - The table has a header row consisting of \"rank\", \"nation\", \"gold\", \"silver\", \"bronze\", and \"total\".\n   - Subsequent rows contain data for different nations, showing their ranks and medal counts.\n   - There is an additional row labeled \"total\" summarizing the overall medal count.\n\n2. **Extracting Relevant Data:**\n   - We need to focus on the \"bronze\" column as well as the \"total\" row to verify the claim about bronze medals.\n\n3. **Checking Bronze Medals for Each Nation:**\n   - United States (USA): 0 bronze medals\n   - Poland (POL): 0 bronze medals\n   - Sweden (SWE): 0 bronze medals\n   - Finland (FIN): 1 bronze medal\n   - Soviet Union (URS): 1 bronze medal\n\n4. **Calculating the Total Number of Bronze Medals:**\n   - Summing up the \"bronze\" column values for all nations:\n     - USA: 0 + POL: 0 + SWE: 0 + FIN: 1 + URS: 1 = 2\n\n5. **Verifying Against the Total Row:**\n   - The \"total\" row indicates a total of 2 bronze medals, which matches our calculation.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is supported by both the individual data entries and the summarized total.\n   - Therefore, the claim \"the total be 2 for bronze\" is TRUE.\n\n7. **Identifying Relevant Cells:**\n   - To verify this claim, we need to look at the cells in the \"bronze\" column for each nation and the \"total\" row's \"bronze\" value.\n   - Relevant cells:\n     - Nations' bronze counts (rows 0-4, column \"bronze\")\n     - Total count (row with \"total\", column \"bronze\")\n\n8. **JSON Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
