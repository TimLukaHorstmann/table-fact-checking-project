Richmond should be listed as the away team in any of those matches.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant columns and data:\n\n- **Date Column**: We need to ensure that all rows have the date \"13 july 1968.\" This is given, so every row qualifies.\n  \n- **Away Team Column**: We need to find if Richmond appears as the away team in any of these matches.\n\nNow, let's check each row for the presence of Richmond as the away team:\n\n1. Row 0: Away team is \"st kilda.\"\n2. Row 1: Away team is \"geelong.\"\n3. Row 2: Away team is \"north melbourne.\"\n4. Row 3: Away team is \"fitzroy.\"\n5. **Row 4**: Away team is \"richmond.\" This matches the condition.\n6. Row 5: Away team is \"hawthorn.\"\n\nSince Richmond appears as the away team in row 4, the claim is supported by this data.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n- The date column across all rows to confirm the match day.\n- The away team column specifically for row 4 where Richmond is listed as the away team.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Locate the row where South Melbourne is playing against Hawthorn:\n   - The relevant row is the last one in the data array:\n     ```json\n     [\n       \"south melbourne\",\n       \"12.10 (82)\",\n       \"hawthorn\",\n       \"15.11 (101)\",\n       \"lake oval\",\n       11191,\n       \"13 july 1968\"\n     ]\n     ```\n   - This row confirms that South Melbourne is the home team and Hawthorn is the away team.\n\n2.
