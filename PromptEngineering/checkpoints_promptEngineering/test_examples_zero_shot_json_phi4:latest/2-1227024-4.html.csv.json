Find the row where the skipper's name is \"james allen.\"\n2. Check if the corresponding \"points\" value for this row is 63.\n\nLet's go through the table data step by step:\n\n- The first column in each data row indicates the overall place, which we can ignore initially since it does not directly relate to identifying the skipper or checking points.\n- The second column lists the yacht name, which again is not relevant for our verification of this claim.\n- The third column contains the names of skippers. We need to find \"james allen\" in this column.\n- Upon examining each row:\n  - Row index 6 shows the skipper as \"james allen,\" with a points value of 63.\n\nNext, we verify:\n\n- In row index 6 (zero-based), under the \"skipper\" column, we see \"james allen.\"\n- In the same row index 6, under the \"points\" column, the value is 63.\n\nSince both conditions are met in this row, the claim is true. The relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n\n1. Column \"skipper,\" Row Index 6\n2.
