This corresponds to:\n  - Row index: 4 (since indexing starts at 0)\n  - Data in this row: `[5, \"foxy\", \"do it again\", \"hanne s\u00f8rvaag (m & l) , harry sommerdahl (m & l)\", \"wildcard\"]`\n\n- Check the \"lyrics (l) / music (m)\" column for draw 5:\n  - The content is: `\"hanne s\u00f8rvaag (m & l) , harry sommerdahl (m & l)\"`.\n  - This matches exactly with what the claim states.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim accurately reflects the information in the table for draw 5.
