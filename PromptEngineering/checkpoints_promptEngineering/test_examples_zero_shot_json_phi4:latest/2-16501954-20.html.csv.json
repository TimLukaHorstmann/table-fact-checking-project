    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the provided table in JSON format, let's break down and analyze each component of the claim:\n\n1. **Claim Analysis:**\n   - \"position of 4 have the point 15\"\n     - We need to check if the team at position 4 has exactly 15 points.\n   \n   - \"it be not smaller than 15\"\n     - This means that if there are any teams at position 4, their points must be 15 or greater.\n\n2. **Table Analysis:**\n   - The table is organized with columns for `position`, `name`, `played`, `drawn`, `lost`, and `points`.\n   - We focus on the `position` column to identify if there are any entries at position 4, and then check their corresponding points.\n\n3. **Verification Steps:**\n   - Locate the row where `position = 4`.
