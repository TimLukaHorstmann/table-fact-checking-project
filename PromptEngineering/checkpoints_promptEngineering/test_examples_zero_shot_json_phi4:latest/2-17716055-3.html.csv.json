    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table data based on two conditions specified in the claim:\n\n1. **Teams with exactly 51 points.**\n2. Among these teams, check if any have more than 5 losses.\n\nLet's break down each step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Teams with Exactly 51 Points\n\n- The column for points is \"points 1\".\n- We need to scan through this column and find entries that are equal to 51.\n\nFrom the data provided:\n\n- Row index 2 (0-based indexing) corresponds to the team \"clitheroe\", which has 51 points.\n\n### Step 2: Check Losses for Teams with Exactly 51 Points\n\n- The column for losses is \"lost\".\n- We need to find the number of losses for the team(s) identified in step 1.\n\nFor \"clitheroe\" at row index 2:\n- Number of losses = 5\n\n### Evaluation Against Claim Conditions\n\nThe claim states that there should be no player (team) with 51 points and more than 5 losses. Based on our findings:\n\n- The only team with exactly 51 points is \"clitheroe\".\n- This team has 5 losses, which does not exceed the threshold of 5.\n\nSince there are no teams meeting both conditions simultaneously (i.e., having exactly 51 points and more than 5 losses), the claim holds true.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim include:\n\n1. The \"points 1\" column for identifying teams with 51 points.\n2. The \"lost\" column for checking the number of losses for these teams.\n\nFor \"clitheroe\", the relevant cells are:\n- Row index 2, \"points 1\"\n- Row index 2, \"lost\"\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
