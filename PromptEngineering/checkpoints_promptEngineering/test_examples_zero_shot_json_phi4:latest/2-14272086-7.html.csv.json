This means there should be four games listed between the specified dates involving these two teams.\n\nLet's analyze each condition:\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n1. **Team Names**:\n   - The table does not mention \"Texas Rangers.\" Instead, it lists various opponents such as \"Yankees,\" \"Orioles,\" \"Angels,\" \"White Sox,\" \"Twins,\" \"Athletics,\" and \"Mariners.\"\n   - Therefore, the first condition fails because there are no games listed against the \"Texas Rangers.\"\n\n2. **Date Range**:\n   - The table shows dates from July 7 to July 10, but these dates involve games against the \"Angels\":\n     - July 7: Angels\n     - July 8: Angels\n     - July 9: Angels\n     - July 10: Angels\n\n3. **Number of Games**:\n   - The number of games listed within the date range (July 7 to July 10) is four, but they are all against the \"Angels,\" not the \"Mariners.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven that there are no games involving the \"Texas Rangers\" and \"Mariners\" on the specified dates or at any other time in the table, the claim cannot be true.

Since Blevins is only recorded as playing against the Athletics, there are no entries for him losing to either the Angels or the White Sox.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the data provided, Blevins did not have any losses against the Angels or the White Sox during July 2008.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false as it does not hold true according to the table's information.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - The only relevant row for identifying Blevins' matches is where he played on July 25 against the Athletics (row index 24).\n   - This includes checking the \"loss\" and \"opponent\" columns in this row.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE, and the relevant cells include information from row index 24 concerning the opponent and loss details.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
