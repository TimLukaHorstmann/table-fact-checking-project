Determine the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) crowd sizes from these values.\n4. Compare these determined values against those stated in the claim.\n\n### Data Extraction:\n\nFrom the table, the \"crowd\" column has the following values:\n- 28628\n- 20000\n- 15000\n- 10000\n- 19500\n- 25000\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Smallest Crowd Size:**\n   - The smallest crowd size in the data is 10000.\n   \n2. **Largest Crowd Size:**\n   - The largest crowd size in the data is 28628.\n\n### Verification Against Claim:\nThe claim states that \"the smallest crowd size be 10000 while the largest crowd size be 28628\". \n- Minimum value found (10000) matches the claimed minimum.\n- Maximum value found (28628) matches the claimed maximum.\n\nSince both conditions in the claim are satisfied by the data, we conclude that the claim is TRUE.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if there were exactly two instances where a team's score was less than 40 points during the matches on \"29 May 1926\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the Table:**\n   - The table contains columns for home and away teams' scores.\n   - We need to check both the \"home team score\" and \"away team score\" for each row.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Scores:**\n   - A football score is given in a format like \"19.8 (122)\", where \"(122)\" is the total points.\n   - We are interested in scores less than 40 points.\n\n3. **Checking Each Row:**\n\n   - **Row 0:**\n     - Home team score: 19.8 (122) \u2192 122 points\n     - Away team score: 12.17 (89) \u2192 89 points\n     - Neither is less than 40 points.\n\n   - **Row 1:**\n     - Home team score: 13.7 (85) \u2192 85 points\n     - Away team score: 5.8 (38) \u2192 38 points\n     - The away team score of 38 points is less than 40.\n\n   - **Row 2:**\n     - Home team score: 10.15 (75) \u2192 75 points\n     - Away team score: 11.7 (73) \u2192 73 points\n     - Neither is less than 40 points.\n\n   - **Row 3:**\n     - Home team score: 9.13 (67) \u2192 67 points\n     - Away team score: 14.16 (100) \u2192 100 points\n     - Neither is less than 40 points.\n\n   - **Row 4:**\n     - Home team score: 9.14 (68) \u2192 68 points\n     - Away team score: 10.15 (75) \u2192 75 points\n     - Neither is less than 40 points.\n\n   - **Row 5:**\n     - Home team score: 7.16 (58) \u2192 58 points\n     - Away team score: 7.6 (48) \u2192 48 points\n     - Neither is less than 40 points.\n\n4. **Counting Scores Less Than 40 Points:**\n   - From the analysis, only one instance of a team scoring less than 40 points was found in Row 1 (away team score).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states \"a total of 2 teams scored less than 40 points during the season,\" but we found only one such instance.\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cell for the identified score less than 40 points is in Row 1 under \"away team score\".\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
