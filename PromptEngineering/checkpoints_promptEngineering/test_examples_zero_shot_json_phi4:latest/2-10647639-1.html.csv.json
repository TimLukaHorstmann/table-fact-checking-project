We are interested in identifying the highest number of points they scored in any one match throughout the season.\n\nHere's how we can proceed:\n\n1. **Extract relevant information from the table**: Look at the \"result\" column, which contains both teams' scores for each game. The score format is \"Patriots Score - Opponent Score.\"\n\n2. **Parse and evaluate each result**:\n   - Game 1: Patriots scored 26 points.\n   - Game 2: Patriots scored 20 points.\n   - Game 3: Patriots scored 17 points.\n   - Game 4: Patriots scored 20 points.\n   - Game 5: Patriots scored 20 points.\n   - Game 6: Patriots scored 28 points.\n   - Game 7: Patriots scored 20 points.\n   - Game 8: Patriots scored 32 points.\n   - Game 9: Patriots scored 17 points.\n   - Game 10: Patriots scored 34 points.\n   - Game 11: Patriots scored 20 points.\n   - Game 12: Patriots scored 13 points.\n   - Game 13: Patriots scored 38 points.\n   - Game 14: Patriots scored 23 points.\n   - Game 15: Patriots scored 27 points.\n   - Game 16: Patriots scored 34 points.\n\n3. **Identify the maximum score**: From the parsed scores, it is clear that the highest number of points scored by the Patriots in a single game was 38 points (Game 13 against the Indianapolis Colts).\n\n4. **Verify the claim**: The claim states that the most points the Patriots scored in a single game were 38, which matches our findings.\n\nSince all conditions have been met and verified against the data, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.

However, during 1985, the Patriots were known simply as the New England Patriots.\n   - Check the \"result\" column for any wins by the Bills (denoted by 'w') against such an opponent.\n\n3. **Review each row:**\n   - Week 1: Opponent is Green Bay Packers.\n   - Week 2: Opponent is Chicago Bears.\n   - Week 3: Opponent is Buffalo Bills. This is a game involving the Bills themselves, not an opponent, so it's irrelevant.\n   - Week 4: Opponent is Los Angeles Raiders.\n   - Week 5: Opponent is Cleveland Browns.\n   - Week 6: Opponent is Buffalo Bills (again a self-game).\n   - Week 7: Opponent is New York Jets.\n   - Week 8: Opponent is Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n   - Week 9: Opponent is Miami Dolphins.\n   - Week 10: Opponent is Indianapolis Colts.\n   - Week 11: Opponent is Seattle Seahawks.\n   - Week 12: Opponent is New York Jets (again).\n   - Week 13: Opponent is Indianapolis Colts (again).\n   - Week 14: Opponent is Detroit Lions.\n   - Week 15: Opponent is Miami Dolphins (again).\n   - Week 16: Opponent is Cincinnati Bengals.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** There are no entries where the \"opponent\" column lists New England Patriots, and there are no games where the result shows a win against them.
