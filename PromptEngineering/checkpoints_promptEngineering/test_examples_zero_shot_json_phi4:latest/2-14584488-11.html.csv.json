    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data in the table:\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n\"The game in the quarter final was not against Chasetown.\"\n\n1. **Identify the row related to the \"quarter final\"**:\n   - We search for the row where the \"round\" column has the value \"quarter final\".\n\n2. **Check the \"opponent\" in that row**:\n   - Once we identify the correct row, we check if the opponent is \"Chasetown\".\n\n### Table Analysis:\n\n- The table has columns: `date`, `round`, `opponent`, `venue`, `result`, and `attendance`.\n  \n- We need to focus on two columns for this analysis: `round` and `opponent`.\n\n#### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **Locate the \"quarter final\" row**:\n   - The data shows that in the 4th index (5th row if counting from 1), the value under the \"round\" column is \"quarter final\".\n\n2. **Check the opponent for this round**:\n   - In the same row (index 3), the \"opponent\" column has the value \"Middlesbrough\".\n\n3. **Evaluate the claim**:\n   - The opponent in the quarter final is \"Middlesbrough\", not \"Chasetown\". Therefore, the claim that the game was not against Chasetown is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The relevant cells for this verification are at row index 3 in both the `round` and `opponent` columns.\n  \nHere is the JSON object with the answer and the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
