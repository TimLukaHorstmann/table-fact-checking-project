Bob Sanders\n     2. Ben Hartsock\n     3. Gilbert Gardner\n     4. Kendyll Pope\n     5. Jason David\n     6. Jake Scott\n     7. Von Hutchins\n     8. Jim Sorgi\n     9. David Kimball\n\n   - There are 9 players listed in the data.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that 10 players were drafted, but only 9 players are present in the table.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - All rows are relevant since we need to verify the total number of players drafted.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"data\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"data\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"data\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"data\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"data\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"data\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"data\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"data\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"data\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the first player select by the colt in this draft be bob sander\" is true or false, we need to evaluate specific details from the provided table.\n\n1. **Identify the First Player Selected**: The first step is to find out who was selected first in this draft. According to the structure of a typical draft, players are listed by their \"round\" and within each round by their \"pick\". Therefore, the player with the smallest combination of `round` and `pick` values would be the first player selected.\n\n2. **Check the First Player's Details**: From the table:\n   - The entry `[2, 12, 44, \"bob sanders\", \"safety\", \"iowa\"]` has the lowest round and pick numbers (Round 2, Pick 12), indicating that Bob Sanders is indeed the first player selected in this draft.\n\n3. **Verify Player's Name**: We need to check if the name matches exactly as stated in the claim.\n   - The table entry lists the name as \"bob sanders\".\n   - The claim mentions \"bob sander\", which has a missing 's' at the end of the last name compared to the table.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since there is a discrepancy between the name provided in the claim (\"bob sander\") and the actual name in the table (\"bob sanders\"), the claim is not fully supported by the data.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is \"FALSE\". The relevant cells from the table that verify these details are those containing information about the first player selected: `round`, `pick`, `overall`, and `name`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
