Check how many passes this player made.\n\nLet's go through the relevant columns and steps to evaluate these conditions.\n\n### Step 1: Locate the Player Named \"sutil\"\n- The relevant column in the JSON table where player names are stored is `\"player\"`.\n- We need to examine each row under the `\"player\"` column to find a match for the name \"sutil\".\n\nBy examining the data, we locate that the player named \"sutil\" appears in one of the entries:\n- Row index 16 contains the player name \"sutil\". \n\n### Step 2: Check the Number of Passes\n- The relevant column where passes are recorded is `\"passes\"` (here referred to as `\"pass\"` in the claim, but it should align with `\"passes\"` from the columns).\n- We need to examine the number of passes for the player \"sutil\" at row index 16.\n\nFrom the data:\n- At row index 16, under the `\"passes\"` column, the value is `223`.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on our analysis:\n- The player name \"sutil\" does exist in the data.\n- This player made exactly 223 passes.\n\nThus, both conditions of the claim are satisfied.

However:\n- The only player with 395 good passes is \"demidov,\" who played 1148 minutes.\n- Therefore, 2795 minutes is not associated with any player having 395 good passes.\n\nThus, the claim is incorrect based on the data provided.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n1.
