    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim \"the location attendance for the 1 - 1 be boston garden,\" we need to verify two conditions from the provided table:\n\n1. The game where the series is \"1 - 1\" should have occurred at \"boston garden.\"\n2. Confirm that this condition holds true by examining relevant data.\n\nLet's evaluate each of these steps using the given table data:\n\n- **Locate the Series Condition**: We need to find which row(s) in the data corresponds to a series score of \"1 - 1.\" From the table, we see:\n  - Row 2 has a series score of \"1 - 1.\"\n\n- **Check Location Attendance for that Game**: Once we've identified the correct row based on the series condition, we need to check if the location attendance for this game was indeed \"boston garden.\"\n  - For Row 2, under the column \"location attendance,\" it states \"boston garden.\"\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied:\n- The series is indeed \"1 - 1\" in Row 2.\n- The location attendance for that game (Row 2) is \"boston garden.\"\n\nThus, the claim is verified as TRUE based on the data provided. We identify the relevant cell as the intersection of Row 2 and the column named \"location attendance.\"\n\nHere's the JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation of Relevant Cells:\n- The first relevant cell is from Row 2 (index 1 in zero-based indexing) and column \"series\" to verify the series score.\n- The second relevant cell is also from Row 2 and column \"location attendance\" to confirm that it took place at \"boston garden.\"",
