    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n1. The entry with \"no in season\" equal to 7.\n2. Check if its corresponding \"original air date\" is October 26, 2009.\n\nLet's break down these steps using the provided JSON data:\n\n### Step 1: Find the Entry with \"no in season\" Equal to 7\n\nWe need to look through the \"data\" list and find the entry where the value for \"no in season\" (second element of each sub-list) is 7. \n\nUpon inspection:\n- The entry at row index 6 has a value of `2` for \"no in season\".\n- Continuing down, we reach row index 9 which has a value of `8`.\n- Finally, at row index 10, the value is `7`.\n\nThus, the relevant row where \"no in season\" equals 7 is at index 10.\n\n### Step 2: Check the Corresponding \"Original Air Date\"\n\nFor this entry (row index 10), we need to check if the \"original air date\" matches October 26, 2009. The original air dates are given in the fifth column of each sub-list within the data array.\n\n- At row index 10, the value for \"original air date\" is indeed \"october 26 , 2009\".\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions required by the claim have been verified:\n1. The entry with \"no in season\" = 7 is at row index 10.\n2. This entry has an original air date of October 26, 2009.\n\nHence, the claim is supported by the data provided.\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification are:\n- The cell at row index 10, column \"no in season\".\n- The cell at row index 10, column \"original air date\".\n\nHere's the JSON response encapsulating our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
