    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table and check if it supports the statement: \"1 percent of respondents have no opinion on George H.W. Bush.\"\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Column**: The claim refers to \"George Bush,\" which in the context of this table is likely referring to \"George H.W. Bush.\" Therefore, we need to look at the column named \"george h w bush.\"\n\n2. **Locate the Row for \"No Opinion\"**: The claim concerns respondents with \"no opinion.\" In the table, there's a row labeled \"no opinion,\" which is the sixth entry in the data list (index 5).\n\n3. **Check the Value for George H.W. Bush in the \"No Opinion\" Row**:\n   - We need to find the value under the \"george h w bush\" column in the \"no opinion\" row.\n   - According to the table, this value is \"1%.\"\n\n4. **Verify the Claim**: The claim states that \"1 percent of respondents have no opinion on George H.W. Bush.\" Since the table shows exactly 1% for George H.W. Bush under the \"no opinion\" category, the claim is supported.\n\n5. **Determine Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cell is in row index 5 (the \"no opinion\" row) and column name \"george h w bush.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to the claim is TRUE. Here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"george h w bush\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Bush under the category \"below average.\"\n\nThe claim states: \"1% of the respondent for George H. W.
