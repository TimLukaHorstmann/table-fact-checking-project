    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify each part of it against the provided table.\n\n**Claim Breakdown:**\n1. The production code \"201a\" corresponds to series number \"14a\" and season number \"1a\".\n2. The title associated with this production code is \"spontaneously combustible\".\n3. The director for this episode is \"igor kovalyov\".\n\nLet's verify these points step by step using the table:\n\n### Step 1: Verify Production Code\n- **Production Code:** \"201a\"\n  - We need to find a row where the \"production code\" column contains \"201a\".\n  - In row index 0, the \"production code\" is \"201a\".\n\n### Step 2: Verify Series and Season Numbers\n- **Series Number:** \"14a\"\n  - Check if the \"no in series\" for production code \"201a\" matches \"14a\".\n  - In row index 0, \"no in series\" is \"14a\".\n  \n- **Season Number:** \"1a\"\n  - Check if the \"no in season\" for production code \"201a\" matches \"1a\".\n  - In row index 0, \"no in season\" is \"1a\".\n\n### Step 3: Verify Title\n- **Title:** \"spontaneously combustible\"\n  - Check if the title for production code \"201a\" is \"spontaneously combustible\".\n  - In row index 0, the \"title\" is \"spontaneously combustible\".\n\n### Step 4: Verify Director\n- **Directed by:** \"igor kovalyov\"\n  - Check if the director for production code \"201a\" is \"igor kovalyov\".\n  - In row index 0, the \"directed by\" column is \"igor kovalyov\".\n\nAll parts of the claim are verified against the table and found to be true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row Index: 0\n  - Columns: \"no in series\", \"no in season\", \"title\", \"directed by\", \"production code\"\n\nThus, the answer is \"TRUE\", and here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"production code\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
