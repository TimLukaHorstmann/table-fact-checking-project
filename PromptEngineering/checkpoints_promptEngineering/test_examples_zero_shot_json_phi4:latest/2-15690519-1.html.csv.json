    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"the song this time be rank 8th with 40 point\".\n\nBreaking down the claim into its components:\n1. The song title is \"this time\".\n2. It should have a rank of \"8th\".\n3. It should have a score of \"40 points\".\n\nLet's examine the table to verify these conditions:\n\n- **Song Title**: Look for the row where the \"song\" column contains \"this time\".\n  - We find this in row index 4: `[\"this time\", \"marion fossett\", 40, \"8th\"]`.\n\n- **Rank**: Check if the rank is \"8th\".\n  - In row index 4, the \"rank\" column shows \"8th\".\n\n- **Points**: Verify that the points are \"40\".\n  - In row index 4, the \"points\" column shows \"40\".\n\nAll conditions from the claim match the data in row index 4. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's list the relevant cells:\n\n1. Row index 4, Column name \"song\": Value is \"this time\".\n2. Row index 4, Column name \"rank\": Value is \"8th\".\n3. Row index 4, Column name \"points\": Value is \"40\".\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two specific conditions from the table:\n\n1. The performer must be \"rob burke band\".\n2. The points for this performer must be 76.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions step-by-step using the provided JSON data structure of the table.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Relevant Row\n\nWe will search through the `data` array to find a row where:\n- The value in the \"performer\" column is \"rob burke band\".\n\n#### Check Each Row:\n\n- **Row 0:** \n  - Performer: \"rob burke band\"\n  - Matches our condition.\n\nThus, row index 0 corresponds to \"rob burke band\".\n\n### Step 2: Verify Points\n\nNext, we verify the points for the identified performer in the relevant row (row 0).\n\n- **Row 0:**\n  - Points: 76\n  - The value matches the claim of having 76 points.\n\nSince both conditions are met:\n- Performer is \"rob burke band\"\n- Points are indeed 76\n\nThe claim is verified as true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nTo identify relevant cells in the table, we need to consider the columns related to our verification steps. These columns are:\n- \"performer\" (to verify it's \"rob burke band\")\n- \"points\" (to check if they have 76 points)\n\nFor row index 0:\n- The performer column is verified at `{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"performer\"}`\n- The points column is verified at `{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"}`\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"performer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
