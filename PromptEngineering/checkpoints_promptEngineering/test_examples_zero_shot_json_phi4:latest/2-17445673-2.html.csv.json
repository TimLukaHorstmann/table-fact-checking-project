    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table and verify if the match with the longest time was a win against David Ross.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Identify Matches by Time Duration:**\n   - We will check each entry in the \"time\" column to find out which match lasted the longest.\n\n2. **Check the Longest Match:**\n   - Compare all durations and identify the maximum value.\n   - Note that times are given in the format \"M:SS\", so we'll convert these into seconds for easier comparison:\n     - Example: \"5:00\" becomes 5 * 60 + 0 = 300 seconds.\n\n3. **Verify Conditions of the Claim:**\n   - The claim specifies two conditions for a match to be considered:\n     1. It must be a win.\n     2. The opponent must be David Ross.\n\n4. **Relevant Data Extraction:**\n   - Extract rows where these conditions are met and compare their durations to ensure it is the longest.\n\n**Analysis of Each Entry:**\n\n- Convert each \"time\" entry into seconds:\n  1. \"1:55\" = 115 seconds\n  2. \"1:34\" = 94 seconds\n  3. \"5:00\" = 300 seconds (win against Osami Shibuya)\n  4. \"3:23\" = 203 seconds\n  5. \"5:00\" = 300 seconds\n  6. \"4:38\" = 278 seconds\n  7. \"0:18\" = 18 seconds\n  8. \"2:23\" = 143 seconds\n  9. \"5:00\" = 300 seconds\n  10. \"5:00\" = 300 seconds\n  11. \"6:58\" = 418 seconds\n  12. \"9:49\" = 589 seconds\n  13. \"5:36\" = 336 seconds (win against David Ross)\n  14. \"1:20\" = 80 seconds\n\n- Identify the longest duration:\n  - The longest match lasted \"9:49\", which is 589 seconds, and it was a win against Eugene Jackson.\n\n- Check if the win against David Ross has the longest time:\n  - The win against David Ross lasted 336 seconds (\"5:36\"), which is not the longest.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim states that the match with the longest duration was a win against David Ross. However, the longest match was a decision (unanimous) win against Eugene Jackson lasting \"9:49\" or 589 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Row index and column names for the entries related to time, opponent, and result:\n  - Match with Eugene Jackson for the longest duration.\n  - Match against David Ross.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
