Manchester United with a value of 1453\n     2. Real Madrid with a value of 1036\n     3. Arsenal with a value of 915\n     4. Bayern Munich with a value of 838\n     5. Milan with a value of 824\n\n2. **Check the Debt Status for These Teams**:\n   - We need to check if these teams have \"debt as %of value\" listed as zero.\n   \n3. **Verification**:\n   - Manchester United: \"84\" (not zero)\n   - Real Madrid: \"10\" (not zero)\n   - Arsenal: \"53\" (not zero)\n   - Bayern Munich: \"0\"\n   - Milan: \"0\"\n\n4. **Count Teams with Zero Debt in the Top 5**:\n   - Only two teams, Bayern Munich and Milan, have a debt percentage of zero.\n\nSince only 2 out of the top 5 most valuable clubs are listed as having zero debt, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification are from the rows corresponding to these top five clubs in both \"value (m)\" and \"debt as %of value\" columns. \n\nHere's how they map out:\n- Row 0: Manchester United (\"value\": 1453, \"debt\": \"84\")\n- Row 1: Real Madrid (\"value\": 1036, \"debt\": \"10\")\n- Row 2: Arsenal (\"value\": 915, \"debt\": \"53\")\n- Row 3: Bayern Munich (\"value\": 838, \"debt\": \"0\")\n- Row 4: Milan (\"value\": 824, \"debt\": \"0\")\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"value (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"debt as %of value\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"value (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"debt as %of value\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"value (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"debt as %of value\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"value (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"debt as %of value\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"value (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"debt as %of value\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The only team from the Netherlands in the entire list is Ajax, which ranks 18th based on value (196 million).\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince none of the top 5 most valuable teams are from the Netherlands, the claim that more than one is from there is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row indices and column names for identifying the top 5 values and their countries.\n- \"value (m)\" for rows: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n- \"country\" for rows: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"value (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"value (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"value (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"value (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"value (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Given our analysis:\n- Manchester United is both the most valuable club and has one of the highest operating incomes.\n- Hence, the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification\n- To verify this claim, we look at the values related to Manchester United's valuation and its position among the clubs with high operating income.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- The row index for \"Manchester United\" in `value (m)` column: Row 0.\n- The row index for \"Manchester United\" in `operating income (m)` column: Row 0.\n- To confirm it's one of the two highest, check:\n  - \"Bayern Munich\" operating income: Row 3.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"value (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"operating income (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"operating income (m)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
