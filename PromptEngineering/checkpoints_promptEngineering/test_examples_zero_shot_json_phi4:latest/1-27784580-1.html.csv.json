Check if \"arienai kisu\" was broadcast 7 days after this earliest broadcast date.\n\nLet's examine each step using the relevant data from the table:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Episode with the Earliest Broadcast Date\n- The table provides broadcast dates for several episodes:\n  - \"i want you\" on May 10, 2010\n  - \"the unthinkable kiss\" on May 17, 2020\n  - \"the proposal out of revenge\" on May 24, 2010\n  - \"that 's how much i liked you\" on May 31, 2010\n  - \"if only i could say , i like you\" on June 7, 2010\n  - \"a prologue of final chapter , farewell\" on June 14, 2010\n\n- The earliest broadcast date is May 10, 2010, for the episode titled \"i want you\".\n\n### Step 2: Check if \"arienai kisu\" was Broadcast 7 Days After\n- The title \"arienai kisu\" corresponds to:\n  - Episode Title: \"the unthinkable kiss\"\n  - Broadcast Date: May 17, 2010\n\n- Calculate the difference between May 10, 2010, and May 17, 2010:\n  - May 17 is exactly 7 days after May 10.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim states that \"arienai kisu\" was broadcast 7 days after the episode with the earliest broadcast date. This condition is satisfied as calculated above.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells from the table are those containing the broadcast dates and titles of the episodes involved in this verification:\n\n- Row index for \"i want you\": 0\n  - Column name: \"broadcast date\"\n- Row index for \"the unthinkable kiss\": 1\n  - Column name: \"broadcast date\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
