    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table in relation to the conditions set by the claim.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"there be 1 woman's double team consist of kerry ann sheppard and carolina harvey when jamie van hooijdonk compete in the men's single.\"\n\nWe need to check two main conditions:\n1. Identify if there is a women's doubles team consisting of Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey.\n2. Verify that this occurs in the same season where Jamie Van Hooijdonk competes in men's singles.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Find the row(s) where \"jamie van hooijdonk\" appears in the \"mens singles\" column:**\n   - Look at each row under the \"mens singles\" column to find Jamie Van Hooijdonk.\n   - From the table, he competes in 2009.\n\n2. **Check the \"womens doubles\" entry for that year (2009):**\n   - In 2009, the \"womens doubles\" team is listed as \"kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey.\"\n   - This matches the claim's requirement of a women's doubles team consisting of Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey.\n\n3. **Verify the conditions are satisfied:**\n   - Jamie Van Hooijdonk competes in 2009.\n   - In the same year, the women\u2019s doubles team is indeed \"kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth conditions specified by the claim are met for the year 2009. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For verifying Jamie Van Hooijdonk in men's singles: Row index 9, Column name \"mens singles.\"\n- For verifying the women's doubles team of Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey: Row index 9, Column name \"womens doubles.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"womens doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
