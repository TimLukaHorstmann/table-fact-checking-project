Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant information is found at:\n  - Row index 5 (since indexing starts from 0), where \"tom watson\" is listed.\n  - Column \"year (s) won\", which contains \"1977, 1981\".\n\nThus, the claim is verified as true based on the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The player name is in the first column, so we search for this value across all rows.\n\n2. **Check Year(s) Won Column**: Once we locate Tom Watson's row, we examine the \"year (s) won\" column to see if it lists both 1977 and 1981 as years he won.\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - From the table data, the relevant row for Tom Watson is:\n     ```\n     [\n       \"tom watson\",\n       \"united states\",\n       \"1977 , 1981\",\n       154,\n       \"+ 10\"\n     ]\n     ```\n   - The \"year (s) won\" column indeed lists \"1977, 1981\", confirming that Tom Watson won in both years mentioned.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the data supports the claim that Tom Watson won in 1977 and 1981, the answer is TRUE.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The row index for Tom Watson is 6 (0-based indexing).\n   - The relevant column to verify the claim is \"year (s) won\".\n\nThe JSON object reflecting this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
