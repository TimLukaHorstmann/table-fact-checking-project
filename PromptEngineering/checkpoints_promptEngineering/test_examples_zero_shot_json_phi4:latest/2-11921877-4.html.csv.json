This is because the death year (1914-1918) provided for each member will indicate whether any member died before or in 1920.\n\nHere's a step-by-step verification:\n\n1. **Examine Each Entry**: For every row in the data, check the value in the \"killed\" column to see if it is after 1920.\n2. **Identify Relevant Rows**: If any entry has a death year of 1914-1918 or earlier than 1920, that contradicts the claim.\n\nNow let's review each relevant row:\n\n- Row 0: Charles Duncombe, killed in 1916\n- Row 1: Guy Victor Baring, killed in 1916\n- Row 2: Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart, killed in 1915\n- Row 3: Percy Clive, killed in 1918\n- Row 4: Duncan Frederick Campbell, killed in 1916\n- Row 5: The Hon Charles Henry Lyell, killed in 1918\n- Row 6: Lord Alexander Thynne, killed in 1918\n- Row 7: Valentine Fleming, killed in 1917\n- Row 8: Philip Glazebrook, killed in 1918\n- Row 9: Francis Bennett-Goldney, killed in 1918\n- Row 10: William Hoey Kearney Redmond, killed in 1917\n- Row 11: Dr. John Joseph Esmonde, killed in 1915\n- Row 12: The Hon Thomas Agar-Robartes, killed in 1915\n- Row 13: The Hon Harold Thomas Cawley, killed in 1915\n- Row 14: The Hon Oswald Cawley, killed in 1918\n- Row 15: The Hon Arthur O'Neill, killed in 1914\n- Row 16: Rt.
