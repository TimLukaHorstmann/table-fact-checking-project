    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table, let's break down the key elements of the claim and compare them with the relevant data in the table:\n\n1. **Label \"Deluxe Records\":** \n   - The claim mentions that INXS signed with Deluxe Records. According to the first row in the table (index 0), there is an entry where the label is indeed \"deluxe records\" for Australia (\"aus\").\n   \n2. **Country:**\n   - For this specific entry, the country is \"australia\", which aligns with the claim's implication that Deluxe Records was involved in Australia.\n\n3. **Date of Release:**\n   - The date mentioned in the table for this LP release under \"Deluxe Records\" is \"30 october 1980\". \n   - The claim states INXS recorded from 1979 to 1980. While the recording period might span across these years, the table shows a release on October 30, 1980. This does not contradict the possibility of recording occurring up until that date.\n\n4. **Recording Budget and Time:**\n   - The claim mentions an additional detail about INXS receiving a budget of $10,000 to record from midnight to dawn during this period. \n   - However, there is no information in the table regarding any budget or specific recording time (midnight to dawn). This part of the claim cannot be verified with the given data.\n\nGiven these observations:\n- The involvement of Deluxe Records and the release date aligns with the country mentioned.\n- The absence of details about the recording conditions such as budget or time period means those elements cannot be confirmed from the table alone.\n\nTherefore, since not all parts of the claim can be supported by the data in the table (specifically, the budget and recording timeframe), the overall answer is \"FALSE\".\n\nHere's the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"label\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

This part of the claim is factual knowledge outside the table, but we can assume it to be true for this exercise since it's a well-known fact.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Entries with \"Mercury Records\"\n\n- **Row 1:** Label = \"deluxe records\" (Not Mercury)\n- **Row 2:** Label = \"mercury records\"\n- **Row 3:** Label = \"atco records\" (Not Mercury)\n- **Row 4:** Label = \"mercury records\"\n- **Row 5:** Label = \"atco records\" (Not Mercury)\n- **Row 6:** Label = \"mercury records\"\n- **Row 7:** Label = \"mercury records\"\n\nFrom this analysis, we find that there are four entries where the label is \"mercury records\".\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Claim\n\n- The claim states that INXS was released a total of 4 times in all formats by Mercury Records.\n- We have verified from the table that there are indeed 4 releases by Mercury Records.\n\nSince both conditions (count and ownership) align with the claim, we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"label\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"label\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"label\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"label\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
