    "resp": "To verify the claim: \"the most under capacity airport, Vit\u00f3ria, be also the airport that have seen the most annual growth,\" we need to check two conditions based on the table:\n\n1. Identify which airport is the most under capacity.\n2. Check if Vit\u00f3ria has the highest annual change.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Most Under Capacity Airport\n\n- The \"capacity in use\" column indicates how much of the total capacity an airport uses. A lower percentage implies more under-capacity usage.\n  \n- From the table, examine the \"Capacity in Use\" for each entry:\n\n  - S\u00e3o Paulo (113.4%)\n  - S\u00e3o Paulo (78.4%)\n  - Bras\u00edlia (134.1%)\n  - Rio de Janeiro (40.2%) **(lowest capacity in use)**\n  - Rio de Janeiro (152.7%)\n  - Salvador (69.1%)\n  - Porto Alegre (52.7%)\n  - Belo Horizonte (213.0%)\n  - Recife (63.5%)\n  - Curitiba (81.2%)\n  - Fortaleza (77.3%)\n  - Florian\u00f3polis (125.7%)\n  - Manaus (75.4%)\n  - Bel\u00e9m (49.3%) **(second lowest capacity in use)**\n  - Vit\u00f3ria (222.5%)\n\n- The most under-capacity airport is Rio de Janeiro with a \"Capacity in Use\" of 40.2%.\n\n### Step 2: Check if Vit\u00f3ria Has the Highest Annual Growth\n\n- Examine the \"Annual Change\" for each entry to find the highest percentage:\n\n  - S\u00e3o Paulo (12.8%)\n  - S\u00e3o Paulo (11.7%)\n  - Bras\u00edlia (45.1%) **(highest annual change)**\n  - Rio de Janeiro (30.4%)\n  - Rio de Janeiro (9.2%)\n  - Salvador (20.0%)\n  - Porto Alegre (11.6%)\n  - Belo Horizonte (7.5%)\n  - Recife (16.1%)\n  - Curitiba (13.0%)\n  - Fortaleza (24.0%)\n  - Florian\u00f3polis (7.8%)\n  - Manaus (10.3%)\n  - Bel\u00e9m (13.5%)\n  - Vit\u00f3ria (6.1%)\n\n- The highest annual change is Bras\u00edlia with 45.1%. Vit\u00f3ria has an annual change of only 6.1%.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim that \"the most under capacity airport, Vit\u00f3ria,\" is also the one with the most annual growth is **FALSE**.\n\nRelevant cells for this analysis include:\n- Row 4 and 5 for Rio de Janeiro's capacity in use.\n- Row 3 for Bras\u00edlia's annual change.\n- Row 15 for Vit\u00f3ria's capacity in use and annual change.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"capacity in use\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"capacity in use\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"capacity in use\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
