    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to assess two specific conditions related to Australia's scores in test matches against England:\n\n1. **Australia scored the most points during their second test match.**\n2. **Australia scored the second most points during their first test match.**\n\nLet's examine the data in the table for relevant information:\n\n- The column \"against\" represents the points scored by opponents.\n- We are interested in rows where Australia is involved, specifically in test matches.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n1. **First Test Match:**\n   - Row 5: Australia | Points Against: 22 | Date: 29/05/1988 | Venue: Ballymore, Brisbane | Status: First test\n\n2. **Second Test Match:**\n   - Row 6: Australia | Points Against: 28 | Date: 12/06/1988 | Venue: Concord Oval, Sydney | Status: Second test\n\nNow, let's analyze the claim:\n\n- **Most Points in Second Test:** In row 6, Australia conceded 28 points. We need to check if any other match has a higher \"against\" value.\n  - The highest \"against\" value is 28 (row 6), so this condition is satisfied.\n\n- **Second Most Points in First Test:** In row 5, Australia conceded 22 points. We need to determine if there are exactly one more match with a higher \"against\" value than 22 and no other matches with the same \"against\" value as 22.\n  - The next highest \"against\" values are 19 (row 8) and 12 (row 7). Therefore, 22 is indeed the second most points conceded by Australia.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied based on the data provided. Thus, the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n\n- Row 5, Column \"against\": Points Against = 22\n- Row 6, Column \"against\": Points Against = 28\n- Other rows with \"against\" values: Row 8 (19), Row 7 (12)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
