    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Indonesia be the only region to get a cassette format release\" is true or false based on the given table, we need to evaluate each row in the data section where the format information might be relevant.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Format Information:**\n   - We are interested in rows where there is a specified \"format\". These rows will have values under the \"format\" column rather than \"-\".\n\n2. **Locate Rows Mentioning Cassette:**\n   - Look for any row where the format is specifically mentioned as \"cassette\".\n\n3. **Check for Regions with Cassette Format:**\n   - We need to ensure that \"Indonesia\" is the only region listed with a cassette format release.\n\n### Analyzing the Data:\n\n- **Row 0:** \n  - Region: Japan\n  - Format: CD with bonus tracks\n  - No cassette here, so irrelevant for the claim.\n\n- **Rows 1-3:** \n  - Regions: United States UK, Argentina\n  - Formats: CD, Paid download\n  - No cassette mentioned, so irrelevant for the claim.\n\n- **Row 4:**\n  - Region: Finland\n  - Format: \"-\"\n  - No format information available.\n\n- **Rows 5-6:** \n  - Region: Australia\n  - Formats: CD, Paid download\n  - No cassette mentioned, so irrelevant for the claim.\n\n- **Rows 7-8:** \n  - Region: Indonesia\n  - Formats: CD, Cassette\n  - Here we find a \"cassette\" format. This is relevant to our evaluation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nUpon reviewing all rows, only row 8 (Indonesia) mentions a cassette format release. No other regions in the table have this format specified.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"Indonesia be the only region to get a cassette format release\" is supported by the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"format\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
