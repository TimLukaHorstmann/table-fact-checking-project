    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim about the provided table in JSON format, let's break down each condition specified in the claim and compare it against the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n\n1. **\"red cliffs have no bye\":**\n   - The column \"byes\" corresponds to this part of the claim.\n   - Check the entry for \"red cliffs\" (last row) under the \"byes\" column, which should be 0 according to the claim.\n\n2. **\"less than 4 losses\":**\n   - The column \"losses\" addresses this condition.\n   - For \"red cliffs,\" we need to ensure that the value in the \"losses\" column is less than 4.\n   - Check the entry for \"red cliffs\" (last row) under the \"losses\" column.\n\n3. **\"more than 2494 against\":**\n   - The column \"against\" pertains to this condition.\n   - For \"red cliffs,\" we must verify that the value in the \"against\" column is greater than 2494.\n   - Check the entry for \"red cliffs\" (last row) under the \"against\" column.\n\n### Verification Against Data:\n\n- **Row Index**: The data indicates that \"red cliffs\" is at `row_index` 7.\n- **Column Names**:\n  - `\"byes\"`: Value is 0, which satisfies \"no bye\".\n  - `\"losses\"`: Value is 18. This does not satisfy the condition of being less than 4.\n  - `\"against\"`: Value is 2422, which does not satisfy the condition of being more than 2494.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that \"red cliffs have no bye with less than 4 losses and more than 2494 against\". However:\n- The \"losses\" for red cliffs are 18 (not less than 4).\n- The \"against\" value is 2422 (not more than 2494).\n\nBoth conditions regarding losses and points against are not met, thus the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nBased on the verification process, the relevant cells to consider from the data table are:\n1. `\"byes\"` at `row_index` 7.\n2. `\"losses\"` at `row_index` 7.\n3. `\"against\"` at `row_index` 7.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"byes\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
