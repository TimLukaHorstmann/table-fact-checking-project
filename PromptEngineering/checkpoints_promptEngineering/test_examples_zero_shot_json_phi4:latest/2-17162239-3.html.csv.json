Identify if Scott Hoch has a score under 66.\n2. If his score is under 66, check if he is from the United States or not.\n\n### Table Examination:\n\n#### Step 1: Locate Scott Hoch's Data\n- We find Scott Hoch in the table where:\n  - Place: \"t1\"\n  - Player: \"Scott Hoch\"\n  - Country: \"United States\"\n  - Score: 66\n  - To Par: \"-4\"\n\n#### Step 2: Check Score Condition\n- Scott Hoch has a score of 66, which is not under 66.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince Scott Hoch does not have a score under 66, the claim about his nationality in such a scenario is irrelevant. The condition for checking if he \"be not from the United States\" never applies because his score isn't below 66.\n\nTherefore, the claim is **TRUE** based on the table data.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nThe relevant cells to verify this are those containing Scott Hoch's information:\n\n- Row index: 0 (Scott Hoch's row)\n  - Columns: \"player\", \"country\", \"score\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
