Therefore, we need to verify if these years match the \"year (s) withdrawn\" for the Undine class.\n\n### Steps to Verify\n\n1. **Locate the Row with Class Name 'Undine'**:\n   - We scan through the data entries for a row where the first column matches \"undine.\"\n\n2. **Check the Withdrawal Year(s)**:\n   - For this specific row, we need to examine the value in the \"year (s) withdrawn\" column.\n\n### Verification\n\n- **Row Index**: The class 'Undine' appears in the 13th row of the data section.\n- **Relevant Cells**:\n  - Row index: 13\n    - Column name: \"class\", Value: \"undine\"\n    - Column name: \"year (s) withdrawn\", Value: \"1884 - 1886\"\n\nThe value for the \"year (s) withdrawn\" column is indeed \"1884 - 1886,\" which matches exactly with what the claim states.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data in the table, we conclude that the statement is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"year (s) withdrawn\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
