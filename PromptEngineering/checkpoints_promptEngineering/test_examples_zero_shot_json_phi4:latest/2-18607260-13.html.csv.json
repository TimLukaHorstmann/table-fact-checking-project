    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify two parts:\n\n1. Whether there is a game involving the Netherlands on June 24, 1998.\n2. Whether there is a game involving Romania on June 28, 1998.\n\nLet's examine each part against the data provided in the table:\n\n### Part 1: Game Involving the Netherlands\n- Check for an entry with \"date\" around \"1998 - 06 - 24\".\n- The entry for June 24, 1998 is:\n  - Date: 1998 - 06 - 24\n  - Venue: stade de toulouse toulouse , france\n  - Score: 1 - 3\n  - Comp: world cup\n\nThis game does not involve the Netherlands as it was held in France.\n\n### Part 2: Game Involving Romania\n- Check for an entry with \"date\" around \"1998 - 06 - 28\".\n- The entry for June 28, 1998 is:\n  - Date: 1998 - 06 - 28\n  - Venue: stade f\\u00e9lix bollaert lens , france\n  - Score: 0 - 0 (1 - 0 aet)\n  - Comp: world cup\n\nThis game does not involve Romania as it was held in France.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim states that the Netherlands have a game on June 24 and Romania on June 28, but neither condition is met according to the table. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n#### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n- For June 24: Row index 13 (Netherlands not involved)\n- For June 28: Row index 14 (Romania not involved)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"neither team scored for only the first game of the world cup in france,\" we need to identify which entries in the table pertain to World Cup games held in France and specifically focus on their scores.\n\nThe relevant condition from the claim is:\n1. The match must be part of the World Cup (\"world cup\" in the \"comp\" column).\n2. It must have occurred during the first game of the World Cup in France.\n3. The score for that match should indicate that neither team scored (i.e., 0-0).\n\nLet's analyze the data from the table:\n\n1. Identify rows where \"comp\" is \"world cup\":\n   - Row index 11: Score = \"0 - 0\", Venue = \"stade de la mosson montpellier , france\"\n   - Row index 12: Score = \"0 - 0\", Venue = \"stade geoffroy - guichard saint - \u00e9tienne , france\"\n   - Row index 13: Score = \"1 - 3\", Venue = \"stade de toulouse toulouse , france\"\n   - Row index 14: Score = \"0 - 0 ( 1 - 0 aet )\", Venue = \"stade f\u00e9liz bollaert lens , france\"\n\n2. From these entries, determine which match was the first game of the World Cup in France:\n   - The date column indicates that June 12th is the earliest date for a world cup match listed (row index 11). It makes sense to consider this as the first game since other dates follow it.\n\n3. Check if neither team scored during the identified first game:\n   - Row index 11: Score = \"0 - 0\", confirming that neither team scored in the first World Cup game of France.\n\nGiven this analysis, the claim is indeed TRUE because the score for the first World Cup match held in France (stade de la mosson montpellier) was 0-0, indicating that neither team scored.\n\nHere's the JSON response with relevant cells identified:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"comp\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
