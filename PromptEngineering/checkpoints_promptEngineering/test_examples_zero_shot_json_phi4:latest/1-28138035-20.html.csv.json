There is a gap between her wins in 2005 and 2008.\n   - No other female player has three consecutive wins in this dataset.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there are no instances of Zhang Yining or any other player winning for three consecutive years, the claim is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - We need to list the cells where Zhang Yining won and those around them to confirm there's no streak.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"womens singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"womens singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"womens singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"womens singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
