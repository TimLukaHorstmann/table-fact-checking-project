Also, St Kilda did not beat North Melbourne; they won with a higher score.\n\nGiven these checks, the relevant cells that need verification are:\n\n- Date: All rows have \"25 June 1927\", so no specific row index is needed here.\n- Teams and Venue: Row index 2\n- Scores: Row index 2\n\nSince the scores do not match those in the claim, and St Kilda actually won, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the table data regarding the VFL season in 1927, we need to verify the conditions mentioned:\n\n1. **Lowest Score Verification**: The claim states that Footscray scored \"the lowest of all games\" with a score of 7.9 at Victoria Park.\n\n2. **Score Comparison**: We will compare the scores of all away teams listed in the table and identify if Footscray's score is indeed the lowest.\n\n3. **Venue Verification**: The claim mentions that this game occurred at Victoria Park, which must be verified against the data.\n\n### Data Analysis:\n\n- From the table:\n  - The relevant rows for comparing scores are those containing \"away team\" and \"away team score.\"\n  \n- Scores of away teams:\n  1. Richmond: 9.20 (74)\n  2. South Melbourne: 15.9 (99)\n  3. North Melbourne: 13.10 (88)\n  4. Footscray: **7.9 (51)**\n  5. Fitzroy: 12.8 (80)\n  6. Carlton: 14.11 (95)\n\n- Comparing these scores, the lowest score is indeed for Footscray with 7.9.\n\n- Venue Verification:\n  - The row stating \"Melbourne\" as home and \"Footscray\" as away lists \"mcg\" as the venue.\n  - The claim incorrectly states that this game occurred at Victoria Park. However, according to the table, it took place at the MCG (Melbourne Cricket Ground).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe statement is **FALSE** because while Footscray did have the lowest score in one of the games, the location stated (Victoria Park) does not match the venue listed in the data (MCG). \n\n### Relevant Cells to Check:\n- For the lowest score verification:\n  - Row index: 4, Column name: \"away team score\"\n  \n- For the incorrect venue claim:\n  - Row index: 4, Column name: \"venue\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
