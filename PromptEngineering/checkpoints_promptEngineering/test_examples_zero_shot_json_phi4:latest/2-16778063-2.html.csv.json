    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"week 12 be on december 2 , 2001,\" we must verify if there is a row in the table where the \"week\" column corresponds to 12 and the \"date\" column matches \"december 2, 2001.\"\n\nWe will go through each relevant piece of data for verification:\n\n1. **Week Column Check:** We need to find a row with a week value of 12.\n2. **Date Column Check:** For that same row, check if the date is \"december 2, 2001.\"\n\nLet's identify these conditions in the provided table data:\n\n- The data has multiple rows corresponding to different weeks and dates.\n- We need to locate the row with week value of 12.\n\nUpon reviewing the data:\n- At `row_index` 11, the \"week\" column contains the value 12, which matches our first condition.\n- In the same row (at `row_index` 11), the \"date\" column is \"december 2 , 2001,\" matching the date in the claim.\n\nThus, both conditions of the claim are satisfied by this row. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification include:\n- The cell at `row_index` 11 and column \"week.\"\n- The cell at `row_index` 11 and column \"date.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the table and compare it with the claim:\n\n- The claim states: \"on week 12 the attendance be 64217.\"\n  \n1. **Identify Week 12**: \n   - From the data provided in the JSON, locate the entry where the \"week\" column is 12.\n\n2. **Check Attendance for Week 12**:\n   - Find the corresponding value in the \"attendance\" column for the row where \"week\" equals 12.\n  \n3. **Compare with Claimed Attendance**:\n   - The claim states that the attendance should be 64217. Compare this number with the actual attendance figure found.\n\nNow, let's execute these steps using the data:\n\n- For Week 12, we find the entry: \n  ```json\n  [\n    12,\n    \"december 2 , 2001\",\n    \"tampa bay buccaneers\",\n    \"l 16 - 13\",\n    52135\n  ]\n  ```\n  The attendance for week 12 is 52135.\n\n- **Comparison**: \n  - Claimed attendance: 64217\n  - Actual attendance: 52135\n\nSince the actual attendance (52135) does not match the claimed attendance (64217), the claim is false.\n\nFinally, identify the relevant cells:\n- The relevant cell for \"week\" is in row index 11 (since JSON indexing starts from 0).\n- The relevant cell for \"attendance\" is also in row index 11.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the opponent was at Cleveland Browns on week 14,\" we need to determine if there is a match between the opponent and the specified week in the provided data.\n\nHere's how we proceed:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: \n   - We need to check two columns: \"week\" and \"opponent.\"\n\n2. **Locate Week 14**:\n   - The claim specifies \"week 14.\" Hence, we should locate the row where \"week\" is equal to 14.\n\n3. **Verify Opponent for Week 14**:\n   - Once week 14 is identified, check if the opponent in that week matches \"Cleveland Browns.\"\n\n4. **Check Data**:\n   - From the data provided:\n     - Row with `week = 5` has \"opponent\" as \"cleveland browns.\"\n     - Row with `week = 11` also has \"opponent\" as \"cleveland browns.\"\n     - There is no row where `week = 14`. Instead, week 14 shows an opponent of \"new york jets.\"\n\nGiven these observations, there is no match for the claim because in week 14, the opponent is \"New York Jets,\" not \"Cleveland Browns.\" Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells to check are those corresponding to `week = 14` and the associated \"opponent\" column.\n\nThus, we can conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
