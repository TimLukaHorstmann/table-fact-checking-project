Check if there is a row where the \"district\" column has the value \"arkansas 2.\"\n2. Verify that in this row, the \"incumbent\" column contains \"wilbur mills.\"\n3. Additionally, confirm that the \"result\" column states \"re-elected.\"\n\nLet's examine each relevant condition:\n\n- **Row Check for District**: \n  - We find that at `row_index` 1, the \"district\" is \"arkansas 2\".\n\n- **Incumbent Verification**:\n  - In `row_index` 1, under the \"incumbent\" column, we see \"wilbur mills\", which matches the claim.\n\n- **Result Check**:\n  - Also in `row_index` 1, the \"result\" is \"re-elected,\" aligning with the claim's condition.\n\nAll conditions specified in the claim are satisfied by `row_index` 1. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nNow, we will identify the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- The \"district\" column at `row_index` 1.\n- The \"incumbent\" column at `row_index` 1.\n- The \"result\" column at `row_index` 1.\n\nThe JSON response with these findings is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"district\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"incumbent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
