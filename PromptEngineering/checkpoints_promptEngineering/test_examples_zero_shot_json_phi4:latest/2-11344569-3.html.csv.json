    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Liechtenstein won more total medals than Malta,\" we need to compare the \"total\" medal count for Liechtenstein and Malta from the provided table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - Locate the row corresponding to Liechtenstein.\n   - Locate the row corresponding to Malta.\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Data in Columns:**\n   - For each of these rows, find the value under the \"total\" column which indicates the total number of medals won by that nation.\n\n3. **Extract and Compare Values:**\n   - From the table:\n     - Liechtenstein (Row 6):\n       - Total medals = 18\n     - Malta (Row 5):\n       - Total medals = 21\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Liechtenstein won more total medals than Malta.\n   - Comparing the totals, Liechtenstein has 18 medals while Malta has 21 medals.\n   - Therefore, Liechtenstein did not win more total medals than Malta.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Liechtenstein's total is less than Malta's, the claim is FALSE.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - For Liechtenstein:\n     - \"total\" value at row index 6.\n   - For Malta:\n     - \"total\" value at row index 5.\n\nThe JSON object representing this evaluation is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
