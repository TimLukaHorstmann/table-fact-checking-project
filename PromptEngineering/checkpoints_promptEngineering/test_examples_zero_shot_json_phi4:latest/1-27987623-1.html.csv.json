According to the table, at row index 0:\n  - **Title:** \"all mixed up\"\n  \nThis condition is satisfied.\n\n### Condition 2: Most-Watched Episode with 8.32 Million Viewers\n- The viewership for the first episode (\"all mixed up\") is given as 8.32 million in row index 0.\n- We need to verify if this is indeed the highest number among all episodes:\n  - Row index 0 has **8.32** million viewers.\n  \nLet's compare this with the viewership numbers of other episodes:\n\n- **Row 1:** 6.97 million\n- **Row 2:** 7.10 million\n- **Row 3:** 7.23 million\n- **Row 4:** 7.38 million\n- **Row 5:** 8.16 million\n- **Row 6:** 7.43 million\n- **Row 7:** 7.05 million\n- **Row 8:** 6.62 million\n- **Row 9:** 6.44 million\n- **Row 10:** 6.57 million\n- **Row 11:** 5.68 million\n- **Row 12:** 5.03 million\n- **Row 13:** 6.51 million\n- **Row 14:** 7.88 million (note: this is higher than 8.32 million)\n- **Row 15 to Row 19** have viewership numbers all lower than 8.32 million.\n\nThe episode titled \"walls\" (row index 14) has the highest viewership with 7.88 million, which is less than 8.32 million for the first episode (\"all mixed up\").\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"the first episode to air, 'all mix up', was also the most-watched episode of the season, with 8.32 million viewers\" is **TRUE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- The title of the first episode: row index 0, column \"title\".\n- The US viewers for the first episode: row index 0, column \"us viewers (in million)\".\n- Comparisons with other episodes' viewership numbers.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (in million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (in million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (in million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (in million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (in million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (in million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (in million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (in million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (in million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (in million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (in million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (in million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (in million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (in million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (in million)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
