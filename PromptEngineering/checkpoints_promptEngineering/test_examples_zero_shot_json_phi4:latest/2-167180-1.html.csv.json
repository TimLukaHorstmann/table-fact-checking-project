If so, whether his film's rank is 7.\n\nLet's examine the relevant part of the data:\n\n- **Column: \"director (s)\"** - We need to look for \"m night shyamalan\" in this column.\n- **Column: \"rank\"** - We need to check if the rank associated with M Night Shyamalan is 7.\n\nBy examining the table, we find:\n- Row index 6 has the director listed as \"m night shyamalan\".\n- In row index 6, the corresponding rank is 7.\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are satisfied: M Night Shyamalan is indeed a director for the film with rank 7. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nHere's the JSON object representing the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"director (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two specific pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. **Title Verification:** The claim mentions \"star war episode ii : attack of the clone.\" We should ensure that this title exists in the dataset with a slight correction for spacing. The correct title given in the data is \"star wars episode ii : attack of the clones.\"\n\n2. **Director Verification:** The claim states that George Lucas was the director of this movie. We need to check if George Lucas's name appears as the director for the corresponding entry.\n\nLet's identify and verify these conditions step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Locate the Movie Entry\n- Search through the `data` list in the JSON table.\n- Identify the row with the title \"star wars episode ii : attack of the clones.\"\n\nUpon examining the dataset, we find:\n- The movie \"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones\" is listed at rank 4.\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Director\n- Check the director(s) for this specific entry (rank 4).\n  \nIn the data at row index 3 (because JSON indexing starts from 0), under the column \"director (s),\" the name provided is \"george lucas.\"\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim that George Lucas was the director of \"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones\" is supported by the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells for this verification are:\n\n- Row index 3 (corresponding to rank 4 in the dataset), column \"title\"\n- Row index 3, column \"director (s)\"\n\nHere's the final JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"director (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
