However, historical context tells us that Jackie Oliver drove for Owen Racing Organisation during the 1970 season.\n\nGiven this information:\n- Jackie Oliver did indeed drive a BRM P153 with a BRM V12 engine.\n- He drove it twice in 1970 (as evidenced by two entries in the table).\n\nThus, all conditions of the claim are satisfied.
