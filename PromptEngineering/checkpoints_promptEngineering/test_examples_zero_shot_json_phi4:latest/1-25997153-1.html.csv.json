This means that \"red all over\" should be episode 44 in series and 19 in season, given that it is directly following episode 41 in series and 18 in season.\n\nHowever, from the data:\n- The `no_in_series` for \"red all over\" is 43.\n- The `no_in_season` for \"red all over\" is 20.\n\nSince the `no_in_series` should be 44 if it were immediately following \"aingavite baa\", but it's actually 43, the claim does not hold true.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to assess if Episodes 1 and 2 in the season have more US viewers than any other combination of two consecutive episodes.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the US Viewers for Episode 1 and Episode 2:**\n   - For episode 24 (first in season), the US viewers are 15.07 million.\n   - For episode 25 (second in season), the US viewers are 15.75 million.\n   - Combined, episodes 1 and 2 have \\(15.07 + 15.75 = 30.82\\) million viewers.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Viewership for All Other Consecutive Pairs:**\n   - Check each pair of consecutive episodes to see if their combined US viewers exceed 30.82 million.\n\n3. **Detailed Calculation for Each Pair:**\n\n   | Episode Pair (by no in series) | Combined US Viewers (in millions) |\n   | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |\n   | 24, 25                         | \\(15.07 + 15.75 = 30.82\\)         |\n   | 25, 26                         | \\(15.75 + 14.7 = 30.45\\)          |\n   | 26, 27                         | \\(14.7 + 15.08 = 29.78\\)          |\n   | 27, 28                         | \\(15.08 + 15.53 = 30.61\\)         |\n   | 28, 29                         | \\(15.53 + 16.21 = 31.74\\)         |\n   | 29, 30                         | \\(16.21 + 16.17 = 32.38\\)         |\n   | 30, 31                         | \\(16.17 + 15.85 = 32.02\\)         |\n   | 31, 32                         | \\(15.85 + 16.37 = 32.22\\)         |\n   | 32, 33                         | \\(16.37 + 15.77 = 32.14\\)         |\n   | 33, 34                         | \\(15.77 + 15.38 = 31.15\\)         |\n   | 34, 35                         | \\(15.38 + 14.56 = 29.94\\)         |\n   | 35, 36                         | \\(14.56 + 16.32 = 30.88\\)         |\n   | 36, 37                         | \\(16.32 + 14.96 = 31.28\\)         |\n   | 37, 38                         | \\(14.96 + 14.84 = 29.8\\)          |\n   | 38, 39                         | \\(14.84 + 14.85 = 29.69\\)         |\n   | 39, 40                         | \\(14.85 + 14.84 = 29.69\\)         |\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Several pairs (28-29, 29-30, 30-31, 31-32, 32-33, 35-36) have more combined viewers than the first two episodes.\n   - Thus, episodes 1 and 2 do not have the highest combined viewers.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
