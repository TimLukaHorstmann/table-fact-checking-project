    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim that \"suspension\" is listed two times in the table as the cause of race retirement, we need to examine the column labeled \"time / retired.\" This column contains either completion times or reasons for retirement if a driver did not finish the race.\n\nWe will search through each row's \"time / retired\" field to find instances where \"suspension\" is mentioned. Here\u2019s how we can analyze it:\n\n1. **Row 0**: \n   - Driver: Jim Clark\n   - Time / Retired: \"2:41:38.4\"\n   - Reason: This indicates a finish time, not a retirement reason.\n\n2. **Row 1**:\n   - Driver: Jackie Stewart\n   - Time / Retired: \"+ 26.3 secs\"\n   - Reason: Indicates a time difference from the leader, not a retirement cause.\n\n3. **Row 2**:\n   - Driver: John Surtees\n   - Time / Retired: \"+ 2:33.5\"\n   - Reason: Again, this is a completion time relative to Jim Clark.\n\n4. **Row 3**:\n   - Driver: Denny Hulme\n   - Time / Retired: \"+ 2:53.1\"\n   - Reason: Another relative completion time.\n\n5. **Row 4 to Row 16**: We continue inspecting until we find relevant entries.\n   \n6. **Row 12**:\n   - Driver: Bob Anderson\n   - Time / Retired: \"fuel system\"\n   - Reason: Not \"suspension.\"\n\n7. **Row 13**:\n   - Driver: Bruce McLaren\n   - Time / Retired: \"suspension\"\n   - Reason: First instance of \"suspension.\"\n\n8. **Continue to Row 14**:\n   - Driver: Jo Bonnier\n   - Time / Retired: \"alternator\"\n   - Reason: Not \"suspension.\"\n\n9. **Row 15**:\n   - Driver: Chris Amon\n   - Time / Retired: \"fuel system\"\n   - Reason: Not \"suspension.\"\n\n10. **Row 16**:\n    - Driver: Innes Ireland\n    - Time / Retired: \"gearbox\"\n    - Reason: Not \"suspension.\"\n\n11. **Back to Row 13** (for further confirmation):\n    - Second instance is already found in Bruce McLaren\u2019s row.\n\nFrom this analysis, the word \"suspension\" appears only once as a retirement cause in the column \"time / retired,\" specifically for Bruce McLaren. Therefore, the claim that suspension appears two times is not true.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this are:\n\n- Row 13 (Bruce McLaren), Column: \"time / retired\"\n\nThus, the JSON result is:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
