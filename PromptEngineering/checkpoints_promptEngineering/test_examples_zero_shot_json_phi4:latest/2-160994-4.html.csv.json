    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"there be 7 stadium locate in london , england\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to focus on two key pieces of information from each row: the 'city' and 'stadium' columns.\n\nHere\u2019s how we can verify the claim:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with City \"London, England\":**\n   - We should look at each entry in the table and check if the 'city' column contains \"london , england\". This is because the claim specifically mentions stadiums located in London, England.\n\n2. **Count Unique Stadiums:**\n   - For rows where the city matches \"london , england\", we need to count the number of unique entries in the 'stadium' column. Each stadium should be counted only once, even if it appears multiple times across different rows with the same city.\n\n3. **Verification Steps:**\n   - Check each row for a match on the 'city' field.\n   - Collect all the distinct stadium names from these matching rows.\n\n4. **Perform the Counting:**\n   - After collecting all unique stadiums, we count them to see if there are exactly 7 different stadiums located in London, England.\n\nLet's apply this approach:\n\n- We find that the following rows have \"london , england\" as their city:\n  - Row index 10: stadium \"ashton gate\"\n  - Row index 11: stadium \"alexander stadium\"\n  - Row index 12: stadium \"crystal palace national sports centre\"\n  - Row index 13: stadium \"stamford bridge\"\n  - Row index 14: stadium \"white hart lane\"\n  - Row index 15: stadium \"wembley stadium\"\n\n- The unique stadiums in these rows are:\n  - \"ashton gate\"\n  - \"alexander stadium\"\n  - \"crystal palace national sports centre\"\n  - \"stamford bridge\"\n  - \"white hart lane\"\n  - \"wembley stadium\"\n\n- Counting these, we have a total of 6 unique stadiums.\n\nSince the number of unique stadiums is 6 and not 7 as claimed, the claim is false.\n\nHere is the JSON response with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"city\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
