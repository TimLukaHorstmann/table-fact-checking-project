The claim states that \"10 of the schools on the list were founded after 1900,\" but our inspection shows only 2 fit this criterion.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. \n\nRelevant cells are those containing the founding years for each institution since these are crucial to verifying the claim:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
