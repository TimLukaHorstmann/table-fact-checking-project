    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if the total attendance for week 8 matches the claimed value of 61,603. We will do this by examining the relevant data in the table provided.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - The claim specifically mentions \"week 8\" and an attendance figure.\n   - From the JSON structure, we can identify that each row corresponds to a game with columns for `week`, `date`, `opponent`, `result`, and `attendance`.\n\n2. **Locate Week 8 Data:**\n   - We need to find the entry in the data array where `week` is equal to 8.\n\n3. **Verify Attendance for Week 8:**\n   - Once we locate the correct row (where `week` equals 8), we check the value under the `attendance` column.\n   - According to the JSON table, the relevant row for week 8 is:\n     ```json\n     [\n       7,\n       \"october 22 , 2000\",\n       \"denver broncos\",\n       \"w 31 - 21\",\n       61603\n     ]\n     ```\n\n4. **Compare Claimed and Actual Attendance:**\n   - The claimed attendance for week 8 is 61,603.\n   - The actual attendance listed in the table for week 8 is also 61,603.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the actual attendance matches the claimed value, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cell to verify this claim is located at `row_index` 7 (since JSON arrays are zero-indexed) and in the `attendance` column.\n\nThus, the conclusion is that the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to verify whether the attendance at the game against the Dallas Cowboys was indeed 62,170 as stated in the claim.\n\nFirst, let's identify which row corresponds to the game against the Dallas Cowboys:\n\n- The column \"opponent\" contains the name of the team that the home team played against.\n- We will search for the row where the opponent is \"dallas cowboys\".\n\nUpon examining the data:\n\n1. Row 0: Opponent is \"cleveland browns\", which does not match.\n2. Row 1: Opponent is \"jacksonville jaguars\", which does not match.\n3. Row 2: Opponent is \"baltimore ravens\", which does not match.\n4. Row 3: Opponent is \"miami dolphins\", which does not match.\n5. Row 4: Opponent is \"tennessee titans\", which does not match.\n6. Row 5: Opponent is \"pittsburgh steelers\", which does not match.\n7. Row 6: Opponent is \"denver broncos\", which does not match.\n8. Row 7: Opponent is \"cleveland browns\", which does not match.\n9. Row 8: Opponent is \"baltimore ravens\", which does not match.\n10. **Row 9**: Opponent is \"dallas cowboys\". This matches the condition in the claim.\n11. Row 10: Opponent is \"new england patriots\", which does not match.\n12. Row 11: Opponent is \"pittsburgh steelers\", which does not match.\n13. Row 12: Opponent is \"arizona cardinals\", which does not match.\n14. Row 13: Opponent is \"tennessee titans\", which does not match.\n15. Row 14: Opponent is \"jacksonville jaguars\", which does not match.\n16. Row 15: Opponent is \"philadelphia eagles\", which does not match.\n\nNow that we've identified the relevant row, let's verify the attendance:\n\n- In Row 9 (the game against the Dallas Cowboys), the attendance is listed as 62,170, which matches the claim exactly.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.
