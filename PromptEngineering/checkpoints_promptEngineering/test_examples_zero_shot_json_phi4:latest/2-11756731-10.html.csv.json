    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down each part of the claim and check it against the table:\n\n1. **Claim:** \"the series go to 2 - 0 on April 16\"\n   - We need to find the row with the date \"April 16\" and check the value in the \"series\" column.\n   - From the data, for the date \"April 16\", the \"series\" value is \"2 - 2\".\n\n2. **Claim:** \"when the attendance is 17113\"\n   - For the same row with the date \"April 16\", we check the \"attendance\" column.\n   - The \"attendance\" value is indeed 17113.\n\n3. **Claim:** \"and Detroit be the visiting team\"\n   - Again, for the date \"April 16\", we need to verify who the \"visitor\" is.\n   - The \"visitor\" column shows \"detroit\".\n\nNow, let's summarize:\n\n- The claim states the series should be \"2 - 0\", but it is actually \"2 - 2\".\n- The attendance and visitor parts of the claim are correct.\n\nSince the series value does not match the claim, the entire statement is false.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this include:\n- Row index 3, column \"series\" (for checking the series score).\n- Row index 3, column \"attendance\" (for checking the attendance number).\n- Row index 3, column \"visitor\" (for checking who the visiting team was).\n\nThus, the JSON object is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
