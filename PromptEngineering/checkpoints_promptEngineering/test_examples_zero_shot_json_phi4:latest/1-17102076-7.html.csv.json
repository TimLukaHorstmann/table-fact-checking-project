    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to examine the relevant information in the table for Game 35:\n\n- **Game Number**: The claim mentions \"game 35,\" so we locate this specific row.\n- **Score**: The claim states that the score should be \"l90 - 98 (ot)\". We need to verify if this is indeed the recorded score for game 35.\n\nWe will now extract and check these relevant pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. **Identify Row for Game 35**:\n   - From the data, we see that the row corresponding to \"game\" number 35 contains the following entries: \n     ```\n     [\n       35,\n       \"january 5\",\n       \"new jersey\",\n       \"l 90 - 98 (ot)\",\n       \"kevin martin (36)\",\n       \"kenny thomas (8)\",\n       \"brad miller (8)\",\n       \"izod center 12314\",\n       \"8 - 27\"\n     ]\n     ```\n\n2. **Verify Score**:\n   - The score listed in this row is \"l 90 - 98 (ot)\", which matches the claim exactly.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied (the game number and the score), we conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells for verification include the cell containing the score for Game 35, which is located at:\n\n- **Row Index**: 4 (since indexing starts from 0)\n- **Column Name**: \"score\"\n\nThus, our JSON response will be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
