    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Claudio Koch / Peter Sch\u00fcbl come in 81st place\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table, we need to verify two conditions from the claim:\n\n1. **Pair Name**: The names given are \"Claudio Koch / Peter Sch\u00fcbl.\" We should check if there is an entry for this exact name pair in the table.\n2. **Rank/Place Position**: If such a pair exists in the table, it must be ranked 81st according to the claim.\n\nLet's examine these conditions:\n\n- **Row Iteration and Name Check**: \n  - We go through each row of data in the \"data\" array provided in JSON format.\n  - The relevant column for names is \"name.\"\n  \n- **Checking Each Row**:\n  - For each entry, we check if the name matches \"Claudio Koch / Peter Sch\u00fcbl.\" It's important to note that case sensitivity matters here. We must ensure it exactly matches including spaces and punctuation.\n\n- **Rank Check**:\n  - If a row is found with the matching names, we then verify whether the rank (given in the \"rank\" column) or places (given in the \"places\" column) equals 81, as specified by the claim.\n\nNow let's apply these steps:\n\n1. **Check Name**: \n   - No entry matches the name \"Claudio Koch / Peter Sch\u00fcbl.\" The closest match is \"claudia koch / peter sch\u00fcbl\" at row index 19 (case-insensitive issue).\n\n2. **Check Rank**:\n   - Even if a similar name were found, we would check the \"places\" value for that entry to see if it equals 81.\n   - The places value for \"claudia koch / peter sch\u00fcbl\" is 174.\n\nGiven these steps:\n\n- There is no exact match for \"Claudio Koch / Peter Sch\u00fcbl.\"\n- Even with a close name match, the place rank of 174 does not support being in 81st place.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells to verify this conclusion are related to the names and places column for row index 19 (since it was the closest match).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"places\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
