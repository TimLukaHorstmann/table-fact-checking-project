Geelong's away team score.\n\nThe claim states that \"Hawthorn's away team score of 9.6 (60) be lower by 1.5 than that of Geelong.\" This implies two checks:\n- Confirm Hawthorn's away team score is indeed 9.6 (60).\n- Check if Geelong's away team score is higher by exactly 1.5 points compared to Hawthorn's.\n\nLet\u2019s break down the verification:\n\n1. **Hawthorn's Score Verification:**\n   - From the table, find the row where \"hawthorn\" appears as the away team.\n   - In row index 0:\n     - Away Team: Hawthorn\n     - Away Team Score: 9.6 (60)\n   - The claim correctly states that Hawthorn's score is 9.6 (60).\n\n2. **Geelong's Score Verification:**\n   - From the table, find the row where \"geelong\" appears as the away team.\n   - In row index 1:\n     - Away Team: Geelong\n     - Away Team Score: 10.11 (71)\n   - Calculate the difference between Geelong\u2019s score and Hawthorn's score in terms of points:\n     - Geelong's Score: 71 points\n     - Hawthorn's Score: 60 points\n     - Difference = 71 - 60 = 11 points\n\n3. **Comparison to Claim Statement:**\n   - The claim suggests that Geelong\u2019s score should be higher by exactly 1.5 goals, which translates to 1.5 * 6 (points per goal) = 9 points.\n   - However, the actual difference in points is 11.\n\nSince the difference in points between Geelong's and Hawthorn's scores is 11 instead of the claimed 9, the statement that Geelong\u2019s score is higher by exactly 1.5 goals than Hawthorn's is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- Row index 0 for Hawthorn's away team score.\n- Row index 1 for Geelong's away team score.\n\nNow, we can provide the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two key components of the statement:\n\n1. **Number of games on 3 June 1933**: The claim states that there were 4 games held on this date.\n2. **Venues used for these games**: According to the claim, none of the venues should be \"arden\" or \"punt road oval\".\n\nLet's analyze each relevant row in the data section:\n\n- **Row 0**:\n  - Date: 3 June 1933\n  - Venue: Lake Oval\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Date: 3 June 1933\n  - Venue: Punt Road Oval\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Date: 3 June 1933\n  - Venue: Brunswick Street Oval\n\nFrom the above, we see that there are only 3 games held on 3 June 1933 (rows 0, 1, and 2). This already contradicts the claim which states there were 4 games.\n\nNext, let's check if any of these venues match \"arden\" or \"punt road oval\":\n\n- **Row 0**: Venue is Lake Oval (does not match).\n- **Row 1**: Venue is Punt Road Oval (matches one of the excluded venues).\n- **Row 2**: Venue is Brunswick Street Oval (does not match).\n\nSince row 1 uses a venue (\"punt road oval\") that should not be used according to the claim, this further invalidates the statement.\n\nThus, based on both conditions from the claim:\n- There are only 3 games on 3 June 1933.\n- One of these games is held at \"punt road oval\", which contradicts the claim.\n\nThe correct answer is \"FALSE\". The relevant cells for verification include the date and venue columns for rows that have the date \"3 june 1933\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down and analyze it based on the provided table:\n\n**Claim:** \"The crowd in Arden Street Oval be 4000 less than the crowd who watch at Brunswick Street Oval.\"\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We need to find the crowd size for both venues mentioned:\n     - Arden Street Oval\n     - Brunswick Street Oval\n\n2. **Extracting Relevant Information from the Table:**\n\n   - **Brunswick Street Oval:** \n     - Row Index 2 (third row in the data)\n     - \"venue\" column value is \"brunswick street oval\"\n     - \"crowd\" column value is 14000\n\n   - **Arden Street Oval:**\n     - Row Index 5 (sixth row in the data)\n     - \"venue\" column value is \"arden street oval\"\n     - \"crowd\" column value is 18000\n\n3. **Verification of Claim:**\n   - According to the claim, the crowd at Arden Street Oval should be 4000 less than at Brunswick Street Oval.\n   - Calculation based on the data:\n     - Crowd at Brunswick Street Oval = 14000\n     - Expected crowd at Arden Street Oval (based on the claim) = 14000 - 4000 = 10000\n     - Actual crowd at Arden Street Oval = 18000\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The actual crowd size at Arden Street Oval (18000) is not 4000 less than that at Brunswick Street Oval (14000).
