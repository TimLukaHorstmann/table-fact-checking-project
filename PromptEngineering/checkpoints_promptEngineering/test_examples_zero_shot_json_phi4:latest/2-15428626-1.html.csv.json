    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to verify two key pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. The date of October 27, 1963.\n2. The opponent listed for the game on this date.\n\nThe claim states that \"October 27, 1963\" is the date of a game against the Houston Oilers. We will cross-reference this with the data provided in the JSON format.\n\nFirst, we look at the entries under the column \"date\" to identify which row contains the date \"October 27, 1963\". From the table:\n\n- The entry for October 27, 1963 is found in row index 6 (using zero-based indexing).\n  \nNext, we examine the opponent listed in this row to verify if it matches \"Houston Oilers\":\n\n- In row index 6, under the column \"opponent\", the team listed is \"oakland raiders\".\n\nFrom this information:\n\n- The date \"October 27, 1963\" indeed corresponds to row index 6.\n- However, the opponent for that game was not \"houston oiler\" but rather \"oakland raiders\".\n\nThus, based on this verification, the claim is FALSE because the opponent does not match the stated team.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table are:\n\n- The cell in row index 6 under the column \"date\" to verify the date.\n- The cell in row index 6 under the column \"opponent\" to check who they played against on that date.\n\nThus, the JSON response is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
