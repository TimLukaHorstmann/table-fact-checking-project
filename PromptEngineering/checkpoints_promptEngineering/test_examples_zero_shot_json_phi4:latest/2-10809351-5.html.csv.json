So, 16 goals and 8 behinds translate to \\(16 \\times 6 + 8 = 104\\) points.\n     - Hawthorn's score: Similarly, 9 goals and 13 behinds translate to \\(9 \\times 6 + 13 = 67\\) points.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference**:\n   - The difference between Carlton's and Hawthorn's scores is:\n     \\[\n     104 - 67 = 37\n     \\]\n   - The claim states that Carlton's score is \"11.18 higher\" than Hawthorn's. Convert \"11.18\" to points: \\(11 \\times 6 + 18 = 84\\) points.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - Compare the calculated difference (37) with the claimed difference (84). Since 37 is not equal to 84, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells for verifying this claim are those containing the home team scores of Carlton and Hawthorn.\n     - Carlton's score: Row index 3, column \"home team score\"\n     - Hawthorn's score: Row index 4, column \"home team score\"\n\nThe JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim that a total of 3 away teams have an away team score less than 10.00, we need to inspect each entry in the table under the \"away team score\" column and count how many scores are below 10.00.\n\nThe relevant \"away team score\" values from each row (corresponding to each match played on 14 May 1949) are as follows:\n\n1. Row Index 0: North Melbourne - Score 6.12\n2. Row Index 1: St Kilda - Score 10.11\n3. Row Index 2: Richmond - Score 9.15\n4. Row Index 3: Collingwood - Score 10.14\n5. Row Index 4: Footscray - Score 6.14\n6. Row Index 5: Fitzroy - Score 14.21\n\nNow, let's determine which scores are less than 10.00:\n\n- North Melbourne (Row 0): 6.12 < 10.00\n- St Kilda (Row 1): 10.11 \u2265 10.00\n- Richmond (Row 2): 9.15 < 10.00\n- Collingwood (Row 3): 10.14 \u2265 10.00\n- Footscray (Row 4): 6.14 < 10.00\n- Fitzroy (Row 5): 14.21 \u2265 10.00\n\nWe observe that the away teams North Melbourne, Richmond, and Footscray have scores less than 10.00.\n\nThus, there are exactly 3 away teams with a score of less than 10.00.
