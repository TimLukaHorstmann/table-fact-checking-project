No other country besides Italy should have this combination of medals.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n#### Part 1: Check Italy's Medals\n- We need to verify that Italy has at least one of each type of medal (gold, silver, bronze).\n\nFrom the table:\n- For Italy (row index 1):\n  - Gold: 1\n  - Silver: 1\n  - Bronze: 0\n\nItaly does not have a bronze medal. Therefore, Italy does not meet the condition of having at least one of each type of medal.\n\n#### Part 2: Check Other Countries' Medals\n- Even though Italy fails the first part, for completeness, we should check if any other country has all three types of medals.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Austria (row index 0):\n  - Gold: 0\n  - Silver: 0\n  - Bronze: 3\n\n- West Germany (row index 2):\n  - Gold: 0\n  - Silver: 2\n  - Bronze: 0\n\n- Poland (row index 3):\n  - Gold: 1\n  - Silver: 0\n  - Bronze: 0\n\n- Switzerland (row index 4):\n  - Gold: 1\n  - Silver: 0\n  - Bronze: 0\n\nNone of the other countries have all three types of medals.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince Italy does not have a bronze medal, it fails to meet the condition of having at least one gold, one silver, and one bronze medal. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nTo verify this, we need to check the \"gold,\" \"silver,\" and \"bronze\" columns for Italy and other countries:\n\n- Italy's medals (row index 1):\n  - Gold: 1\n  - Silver: 1\n  - Bronze: 0\n\n- Austria's medals (row index 0):\n  - Gold: 0\n  - Silver: 0\n  - Bronze: 3\n\n- West Germany's medals (row index 2):\n  - Gold: 0\n  - Silver: 2\n  - Bronze: 0\n\n- Poland's medals (row index 3):\n  - Gold: 1\n  - Silver: 0\n  - Bronze: 0\n\n- Switzerland's medals (row index 4):\n  - Gold: 1\n  - Silver: 0\n  - Bronze: 0\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
