    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to verify two main conditions from the provided data in the table:\n\n1. The largest first leg score difference must be 0 - 7.\n2. This particular result must have occurred with the team G\u00f3rnik Zabrze during the 1994-95 season.\n\nLet's break down the verification process:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the relevant entries\nWe need to examine each entry in the \"data\" section of the JSON to find any matches for the given conditions. Specifically, we should look at:\n- The \"season\" column to check if it corresponds to \"1994 - 95\".\n- The \"club\" column to see if it contains \"g\u00f3rnik zabrze\".\n- The \"1st leg\" column to determine if the score is \"0 - 7\".\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the data\nFrom the JSON, here's how we can verify:\n\n- We find an entry with:\n  - Season: \"1994 - 95\"\n  - Competition: \"uefa cup\"\n  - Round: \"preliminary round\"\n  - Club: \"g\u00f3rnik zabrze\"\n  - 1st leg score: \"0 - 7\"\n\nThis matches both the specified season and club, as well as the largest first-leg score difference mentioned in the claim.\n\n### Step 3: Verify other entries\nWe should ensure there are no other entries with a larger goal differential than 0 - 7. By checking through each row of data:\n\n- No other scores have a greater losing margin than \"0 - 7\".\n\n### Conclusion\nSince the entry for G\u00f3rnik Zabrze in the 1994-95 season has a first leg score difference of 0 - 7, and no other entries exceed this goal differential, the claim is supported by the data.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is \"TRUE\".

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Celtic and Omonia never have a first leg of 0 - 1\" is true or false, we need to examine each entry in the provided data table for occurrences involving Celtic and AC Omonia. Specifically, we should focus on the \"club\" column where these teams are listed and check their corresponding \"1st leg\" results.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Entries**:\n   - We need to find all rows in which either \"Celtic\" or \"AC Omonia\" appears under the \"club\" column.\n   \n2. **Examine Results for Specific Matchups**:\n   - For each relevant entry, we check if the score listed in the \"1st leg\" column is \"0 - 1\".\n\n3. **Review Each Entry**:\n   - Look through the data to find entries for Celtic and AC Omonia.\n   - Verify their corresponding match results.\n\n### Detailed Examination:\n\n- **Celtic**:\n  - The table shows one entry with Celtic as a club during the season \"1986 - 87\":\n    - Row Index: 15\n    - Club: Celtic\n    - 1st Leg Result: 0 - 1\n\n- **AC Omonia**:\n  - The table includes an entry for AC Omonia in the season \"1987 - 88\":\n    - Row Index: 16\n    - Club: AC Omonia\n    - 1st Leg Result: 0 - 1\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBoth Celtic and AC Omonia have entries where their first leg result was \"0 - 1\". Therefore, the claim that they never have a first leg of \"0 - 1\" is false.\n\n# Relevant Cells:\n- For Celtic: Row Index 15 with Column Name \"club\" and \"1st leg\".\n- For AC Omonia: Row Index 16 with Column Name \"club\" and \"1st leg\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"club\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"club\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
