We need to find the entry in the data where the date is \"sun nov 26\".\n\n2. **Record Check**: The claim specifies a record of \"6 - 6\" for this game. Once we find the row with the correct date, we check if the \"record\" column matches \"6 - 6\".\n\n3. **Result Check**: The claim mentions a result of \"w 34 - 14\". For the identified row, verify if the \"result\" column shows \"w 34 - 14\".\n\n4. **Time Check**: Finally, the claim specifies a time \"( et ) of 1:00 pm\". We need to ensure that the \"time (et)\" column for this entry is \"1:00 pm\".\n\nNow, let's locate and verify these details:\n\n- First, identify the row with the date \"sun nov 26\":\n  - This corresponds to row index 11 in the data.\n\n- Check each relevant condition for this row:\n  - **Date**: The date is indeed \"sun nov 26\".\n  - **Record**: The record at this row is \"6 - 6\".\n  - **Result**: The result listed is \"w 34 - 14\".\n  - **Time (et)**: The time of the game is \"1:00 pm\".\n\nAll conditions specified in the claim match the data for row index 11.

The date \"Sunday, October 1\".\n2. The location \"Pontiac Silverdome\".\n\nNow, let's break down the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. **Identify the row corresponding to Sunday, October 1:**\n   - In the table, we look for a match with the \"date\" column that contains \"sun oct 1\". This corresponds to the date part of our claim.\n\n2. **Verify the location is Pontiac Silverdome:**\n   - Once we've identified the correct row from step 1, we check the \"location\" column in that row to see if it matches \"pontiac silverdome\".\n\n3. **Check the day of the week and time:** \n   - Additionally, ensure that the \"week\" number corresponds with Sunday, October 1 being part of Week 4.\n   - Although not explicitly asked for in the claim, confirming the game was played on a Sunday at 1:00 pm (as per the table) aligns well but isn't necessary to verify the truth of this specific claim.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- **Step 1:** Identify the row with \"date\" = \"sun oct 1\":\n  - The table shows that Row 3 matches \"week\": 4, and \"date\": \"sun oct 1\".\n\n- **Step 2:** Verify the location:\n  - In Row 3, the \"location\" is indeed \"pontiac silverdome\", matching the claim.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are satisfied (correct date and location), we can conclude that the statement is true.\n\nThus, the relevant cells used to verify this claim are:\n- Row Index: 3\n  - Column Name: \"week\"\n  - Column Name: \"date\"\n  - Column Name: \"location\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
