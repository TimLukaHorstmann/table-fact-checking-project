    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Justin Rose be from the United States\" is true or false based on the given table, we need to focus on verifying two specific pieces of information related to Justin Rose:\n\n1. **Player's Name**: We need to ensure that there is a player named \"Justin Rose\".\n2. **Country**: If such a player exists, we need to check which country he represents.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant entries in the table:\n- The data is provided under the column headings: \"place\", \"player\", \"country\", \"score\", and \"to par\".\n- We need to find the row where the player name matches \"Justin Rose\" and then verify his country.\n\n### Checking the Table\nFrom the given data:\n\n| Place | Player            | Country   | Score             | To Par |\n|-------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|--------|\n| 5     | Justin Rose (a)   | England   | 72 + 66 + 75 = 213| + 3    |\n\n- **Row Index**: The row containing \"Justin Rose\" is the fifth entry in the data array (index 4 when zero-indexed).\n- **Player Column**: In this row, under the \"player\" column, we find \"Justin Rose (a)\".\n- **Country Column**: Under the \"country\" column for this same row, it states \"England\".\n\n### Evaluating the Claim\nThe claim is that Justin Rose is from the United States. From our examination:\n- The table lists Justin Rose's country as England, not the United States.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nTo verify this claim, we have identified two relevant pieces of information located in one specific row:\n1. **Player Name**: Row index 4, column \"player\"\n2. **Country**: Row index 4, column \"country\"\n\nThese are sufficient to evaluate and refute the claim.\n\n### Final JSON Response\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Danish Thomas Bj\u00f8rn ranks lower than Tiger Woods,\" we need to compare their positions based on the given table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - Find the row corresponding to Thomas Bj\u00f8rn.\n     - He is listed with a rank of \"t6\" and has the entry \"Thomas Bj\u00f8rn, Denmark.\"\n   - Find the row corresponding to Tiger Woods.\n     - He is also listed with a rank of \"t6.\"\n\n2. **Compare Their Positions:**\n   - Both Thomas Bj\u00f8rn and Tiger Woods are tied at position 6th (\"t6\"), indicating they have the same ranking.\n\n3. **Determine Truthfulness of the Claim:**\n   - Since both players share the same ranking, it is incorrect to say that Thomas Bj\u00f8rn ranks lower than Tiger Woods.\n\n4. **Identify Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - For Thomas Bj\u00f8rn:\n     - Row index 5 in the data array.\n     - The relevant column is \"place\" to check his rank (\"t6\").\n   - For Tiger Woods:\n     - Row index 8 in the data array.\n     - The relevant column is also \"place\" to confirm his rank (\"t6\").\n\nThe claim is false because Thomas Bj\u00f8rn does not rank lower than Tiger Woods; they are tied.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
