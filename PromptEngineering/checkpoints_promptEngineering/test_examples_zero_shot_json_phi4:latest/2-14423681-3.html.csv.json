    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify each condition in the claim against the data provided in the table:\n\n### Claim Conditions:\n1. **Bronze medal with more than 1 medal total**: We need to identify rows where the \"bronze\" column has a value greater than 1.\n2. **Fewer than 1 silver medal**: The \"silver\" column should have a value less than 1 (i.e., 0).\n3. **Rank of 8**: The \"rank\" column should be equal to 8.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with More Than 1 Bronze Medal**:\n   - Bahamas: Bronze = 10\n   - Puerto Rico: Bronze = 10\n   - Colombia: Bronze = 5\n   - Bermuda: Bronze = 2\n\n2. **Check for Fewer than 1 Silver Medal**:\n   - From the rows identified above, check if \"silver\" is less than 1 (i.e., 0):\n     - Bahamas: Silver = 3 (not fewer than 1)\n     - Puerto Rico: Silver = 1 (not fewer than 1)\n     - Colombia: Silver = 2 (not fewer than 1)\n     - Bermuda: Silver = 2\n\n   Only Bermuda has a \"bronze\" count greater than 1 and \"silver\" equal to 0.\n\n3. **Check Rank of 8**:\n   - Bermuda is the only row with \"bronze\" > 1, \"silver\" < 1, and we need to check if its rank is 8.\n   - Bermuda: Rank = 8\n\nBermuda satisfies all conditions specified in the claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince there exists a row (Bermuda) that meets all the criteria of having more than 1 bronze medal, fewer than 1 silver medal, and a rank of 8, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Bermuda's row (index 7):\n  - \"rank\" = 8\n  - \"silver\" = 2\n  - \"bronze\" = 2\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
