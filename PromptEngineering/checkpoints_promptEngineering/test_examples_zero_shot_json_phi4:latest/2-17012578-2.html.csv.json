The third/vice skip for Jean-Michel M\u00e9nard should be Martin Cr\u00eate.\n2. The second for Jean-Michel M\u00e9nard should be \u00c9ric Sylvain.\n\nLet's break down how to check these conditions using the provided JSON data:\n\n### Table Structure\nThe table has columns labeled as \"skip\", \"third / vice skip\", \"second\", \"lead\", and \"city\". Each row represents a team with corresponding players' names in these positions, along with their city.\n\n### Verification Steps\n\n1. **Identify Jean-Michel M\u00e9nard's Row:**\n   - We need to find the row where the \"skip\" is \"jean-michel m\u00e9nard\".\n\n2. **Check the Third / Vice Skip:**\n   - In that specific row, check if the value in the \"third / vice skip\" column matches \"martin cr\u00eate\".\n\n3. **Check the Second:**\n   - In the same row, verify if the value in the \"second\" column is \"\u00e9ric sylvain\".\n\n### Detailed Check\n\n- **Row Identification:**\n  - Scan through the rows to find where the \"skip\" is \"jean-michel m\u00e9nard\". This corresponds to `row_index` 8.\n\n- **Column Verification:**\n  - At `row_index` 8:\n    - The value in the \"third / vice skip\" column is \"martin cr\u00eate\".\n    - The value in the \"second\" column is \"\u00e9ric sylvain\".\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, meaning the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells to verify the claim are:\n- Row 8, Column \"third / vice skip\"\n- Row 8, Column \"second\"\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"third / vice skip\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"second\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
