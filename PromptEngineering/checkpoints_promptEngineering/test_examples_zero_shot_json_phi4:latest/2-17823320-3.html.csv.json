Ensure the location for this event is \"Sopot\" (though not explicitly part of the claim, it's implicitly relevant since all data is for Sopot).\n\nLet's examine each entry from the table to find the row where the year is 1999:\n\n- The table has multiple rows with a column labeled \"year.\" We need to identify the row where this column contains the value \"1999.\"\n\nUpon inspection of the data:\n- For the entry with `row_index` 6, the year is 1999.\n\nNow, let's check if Karina Hab\u0161udov\u00e1 is listed as the \"runner-up\" in that row:\n\n- In the row with `row_index` 6, under the column \"runner - up,\" we find \"karina hab\u0161udov\u00e1.\"\n\nThis confirms both conditions of the claim:\n1.
