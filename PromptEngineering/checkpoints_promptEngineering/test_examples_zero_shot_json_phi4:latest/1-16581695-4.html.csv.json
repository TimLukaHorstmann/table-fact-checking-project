We need to find which row contains the production code \"303\".\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- We look for the row with the production code \"303\":\n  - In the data, this is found in the third row (index 2), which corresponds to:\n    - `no in series`: \"30\"\n    - `production code`: \"303\"\n\n- Now, check if the \"no in series\" value of this row (\"30\") matches the claim that it should be \"29\".\n\nSince the production code \"303\" is associated with \"no in series\" value \"30\", not \"29\", the claim is false.\n\nNow, identify the relevant cells:\n\n1.

It is indeed the 15th episode in the third season.\n2. Its production code is \"315\".\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification\n\n- Row 14:\n  - Column: \"no in season\" with value \"15\"\n  - Column: \"production code\" with value \"315\"\n\nThe JSON response based on this verification is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"production code\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n(Note: The `row_index` is zero-based, so the 15th row corresponds to index 14, which is row 13 in zero-based indexing.)",
