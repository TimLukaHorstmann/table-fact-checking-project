Finding the Row for January 2, 2000:**\n\nThe table includes a row with:\n- Date: \"january 2 , 2000\"\n- Attendance: 69,278\n- Result: \"l 12 - 6\"\n\nThis corresponds to `row_index` 16 in the data array.\n\n**2.

Evaluating the Claim:**\n\nThe claim states that the attendance should not be 69,278 and implies a contradiction in the result stated (\"i 12 - 6\" instead of \"l 12 - 6\").
