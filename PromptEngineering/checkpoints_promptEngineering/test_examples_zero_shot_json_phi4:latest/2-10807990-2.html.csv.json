Richmond is listed as the \"away team.\"\n2.

All matches in the data are on this date, so we need to locate the row where Carlton is listed as the \"home team\" and South Melbourne as the \"away team.\"\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Data**:\n   - From the table, the second entry (row index 1) corresponds to the match between Carlton and South Melbourne.\n   - Check the \"home team score\" for this row to verify Carlton's score.\n\n3. **Verify Scores**:\n   - In row index 1, \"home team\" is \"carlton\" with a \"home team score\" of \"8.11 (59)\".\n   - The claim states Carlton scored \"16.13 (109)\", which does not match the actual score of \"8.11 (59)\".\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since Carlton's actual score does not match the claimed score, the statement is FALSE.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells to verify this claim are the \"home team\" and \"home team score\" for row index 1.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
