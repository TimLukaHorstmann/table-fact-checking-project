    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if Lake Oval attracted the second smallest crowd among all games listed in the table.\n\n**Step-by-step verification:**\n\n1. **Identify relevant data**: \n   - We need to focus on the \"crowd\" column for each game to assess the size of the crowds.\n   \n2. **Extract and list crowd numbers**:\n   - essendon vs north melbourne at Windy Hill: 19,229\n   - collingwood vs richmond at Victoria Park: 36,729\n   - carlton vs fitzroy at Princes Park: 13,400\n   - south melbourne vs geelong at Lake Oval: 12,176\n   - melbourne vs footscray at MCG: 17,951\n   - hawthorn vs st kilda at VFL Park: 21,561\n\n3. **Sort the crowd numbers in ascending order**:\n   - 12,176 (south melbourne vs geelong)\n   - 13,400 (carlton vs fitzroy)\n   - 17,951 (melbourne vs footscray)\n   - 19,229 (essendon vs north melbourne)\n   - 21,561 (hawthorn vs st kilda)\n   - 36,729 (collingwood vs richmond)\n\n4. **Identify the second smallest crowd**:\n   - The smallest crowd is 12,176 for south melbourne vs geelong at Lake Oval.\n   - The second smallest crowd is 13,400 for carlton vs fitzroy.\n\n5. **Compare with the claim**:\n   - The claim states that \"lake oval draw[ed] the second smallest crowd of any of the game,\" but we found that Lake Oval actually drew the smallest crowd (12,176). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n6. **Relevant cells for verification**:\n   - We need to consider all rows under the \"crowd\" column to verify the claim about crowd sizes and order them accordingly.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Geelong do not play on August 17, 1974\" is true or false, we need to check if there's any entry in the data where Geelong appears as either the home team or the away team on that specific date.\n\nLet's go through the data provided:\n\n1. **Row 0**: \n   - Home Team: Essendon\n   - Away Team: North Melbourne\n   - Date: August 17, 1974\n\n2. **Row 1**:\n   - Home Team: Collingwood\n   - Away Team: Richmond\n   - Date: August 17, 1974\n\n3. **Row 2**:\n   - Home Team: Carlton\n   - Away Team: Fitzroy\n   - Date: August 17, 1974\n\n4. **Row 3**:\n   - Home Team: South Melbourne\n   - Away Team: Geelong\n   - Date: August 17, 1974\n   \n5. **Row 4**:\n   - Home Team: Melbourne\n   - Away Team: Footscray\n   - Date: August 17, 1974\n\n6. **Row 5**:\n   - Home Team: Hawthorn\n   - Away Team: St Kilda\n   - Date: August 17, 1974\n\nFrom the data, we observe that in **row 3**, Geelong is listed as the away team on August 17, 1974.
