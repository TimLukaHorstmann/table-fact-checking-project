We will look for this name in the \"player\" column.\n2. **Position**: The claim specifies that Brandon Sutter's position is \"c or w\". This corresponds to the \"position\" column, where we expect the value to be either \"c\", \"w\", or \"c / w\".\n3. **Draft Round**: The claim mentions that he was drafted in \"round 1\". We will check this against the \"round\" column.\n\nLet's examine the relevant row from the table:\n\n- **Row 0**:\n  - \"player\": \"brandon sutter\"\n  - \"position\": \"c / w\"\n  - \"round\": 1\n\nNow, let's verify each condition:\n- The player name is indeed \"Brandon Sutter\".\n- His position is listed as \"c / w\", which satisfies the claim of being \"c or w\".\n- He was drafted in round 1.\n\nSince all conditions are satisfied, the claim is true.\n\nRelevant cells to check:\n- Row index: 0\n- Column names: \"player\", \"position\", \"round\"\n\nThe JSON object with the answer and relevant cells is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Locate Brett Bellemore in the \"player\" column.\n2. Check the corresponding entry in the \"nationality\" column.\n\nFrom the table provided in JSON format:\n- Brett Bellemore is listed at row index 4 (the fifth entry in the data array).\n- The \"nationality\" for Brett Bellemore in this row is \"Canada.\"\n\nSince both conditions are met, the claim is supported by the data. Therefore, the answer is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- Row index 4 for the column \"player,\" where we find \"Brett Bellemore.\"\n- Row index 4 for the column \"nationality,\" which confirms \"Canada.\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"the position for round 3 be lw,\" we need to verify if the player selected in round 3 holds a position labeled as \"lw\" (left wing).\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row**: \n   - The claim specifies \"round 3.\" We need to find the row in the data where the \"round\" column is equal to 3.\n\n2. **Verify Position**:\n   - In this identified row, check the value in the \"position\" column to see if it matches \"lw.\"\n\nNow let's apply these steps:\n\n- Locate the row with `round = 3`.
