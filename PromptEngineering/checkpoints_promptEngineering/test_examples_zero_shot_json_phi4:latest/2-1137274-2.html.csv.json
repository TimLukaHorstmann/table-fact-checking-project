This gives us the total number of episodes.\n   \n2. **Verify Director for Each Episode**:\n   - For each row, check if \"Don Colliver\" is listed under the \"directed by\" column.\n\n### Execution\n\n- **Total Episodes**: By counting the rows in the data, there are 21 entries (episodes) provided in the dataset.\n  \n- **Director Verification**: \n  - Look at the \"directed by\" column for all rows. All entries list \"Don Colliver\" as the director.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that Don Colliver directed 25 episodes out of 27. However, from our verification:\n- There are only 21 episodes listed in the dataset.\n- Don Colliver is indeed the director for each of these 21 episodes.\n\nSince the total number of episodes does not match the \"27\" mentioned in the claim, and since Don Colliver directed all 21 episodes present (not 25), the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are those under the \"directed by\" column for each row. Since every row is relevant due to the need to confirm the director for each episode, we will list them with their indices:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
