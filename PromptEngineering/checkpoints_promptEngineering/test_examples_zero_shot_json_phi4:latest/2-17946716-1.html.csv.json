    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the game at Griffith Stadium on October 9, 1960, we need to verify several aspects of the table against the specific conditions mentioned in the claim.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row**: The claim mentions a specific date: \"October 9, 1960.\" By examining the \"date\" column, we find that this corresponds to row index 2 in the data array.\n\n2. **Verify Game Site**: The claim specifies the game was at \"Griffith Stadium.\" We need to check the \"game site\" column for the same row (index 2) and confirm it matches \"Griffith Stadium.\"\n\n3. **Verify Opponent**: Although not directly required by the claim, verifying additional details can strengthen the consistency of our findings. The opponent on that date was \"Washington Redskins,\" which is consistent with historical records.\n\n4. **Cross-check Result, Record, and Attendance**: While not explicitly stated in the claim, it's useful to ensure these align correctly:\n   - The \"result\" for this game should be \"l 14 - 26.\"\n   - The team record at that point was \"0 - 3.\"\n   - The attendance was recorded as 21,142.\n\nBased on the above checks, all conditions in the claim are satisfied by row index 2. Therefore, the statement is true. \n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- Row index 2, Column: \"date\" (to confirm the date)\n- Row index 2, Column: \"game site\" (to confirm the location)\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we must verify whether the date for Week 3 matches October 9, 1960. We need to identify relevant data points in the table that pertain specifically to week 3 and its associated date.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: Locate the row corresponding to \"Week\" with a value of 3.\n2. **Check Date for Week 3**: Verify if the \"Date\" column entry for this row is indeed October 9, 1960.\n3. **Compare and Conclude**: If both the week number and date match as stated in the claim, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\n### Verification:\n- In the data array provided in JSON format, we look at each sub-array which corresponds to a row in the table.\n- Specifically, for Week 3, we find:\n\n```json\n[\n    [3, \"october 9 , 1960\", \"washington redskins\", \"l 14 - 26\", \"griffith stadium\", \"0 - 3\", 21142.0]\n]\n```\n\n- The row index is 2 (considering a zero-based indexing common in programming).\n- The column for \"week\" contains the value 3.\n- The corresponding \"date\" is exactly \"october 9 , 1960\".\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim that the date of Week 3's game is October 9, 1960, matches the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n    ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine if October 9, 1960, is indeed the date following Week 3 according to the table provided.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column**: \n   - The \"date\" column will give us the dates of each game.\n   - The \"week\" column will tell us which week each game falls into.\n\n2. **Locate the data for Week 3**:\n   - From the table, we see that in Row 3 (0-indexed), \"Week\" is 3 and \"Date\" is October 9, 1960.\n\n3. **Determine if October 9, 1960, follows Week 3**:\n   - Since Row 3 contains both the week number 3 and the date October 9, 1960, it confirms that this date corresponds to Week 3.\n   - We need to check if there is any data for a game in Week 4 following October 9, 1960.\n\n4. **Check for Week 4**:\n   - In Row 4 (0-indexed), \"Week\" is 4 and \"Date\" is October 16, 1960.\n   - This confirms that October 16, 1960, follows October 9, 1960, making the claim true.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: \n   - The date October 9, 1960, is indeed associated with Week 3.\n   - There is a subsequent week (Week 4) with a later date, confirming that October 9, 1960, is followed by another game date in Week 4.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
