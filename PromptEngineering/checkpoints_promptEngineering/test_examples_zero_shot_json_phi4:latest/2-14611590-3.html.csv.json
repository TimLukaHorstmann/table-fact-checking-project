However, since the task is to check only what's available in the table, we will focus on verifying the wins for both players.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Greg Norman's Wins:**\n   - From the table, Greg Norman is listed in row 0.\n   - Check the \"wins\" column for this row:\n     - Row Index: 0\n     - Column Name: \"wins\"\n     - Value: 3\n\n2. **Identify Lee Janzen's Wins:**\n   - From the table, Lee Janzen is listed in row 2.\n   - Check the \"wins\" column for this row:\n     - Row Index: 2\n     - Column Name: \"wins\"\n     - Value: 3\n\nBoth Greg Norman and Lee Janzen have 3 wins according to the data provided in the table.
