There are two such entries:\n     - Row index 0: Date is \"4 february\", Crowd is 4621.\n     - Row index 1: Date is \"4 february\", Crowd is 920.\n\n2. **Evaluate the Claim Against Each Relevant Row:**\n   - For Row index 0, the crowd size is 4621.\n   - For Row index 1, the crowd size is 920.\n\n3. **Check the Condition of the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that all matches on February 4 should have a \"score\" smaller than 4485.\n   - Since we are considering \"crowd\" as the relevant numeric value for comparison (based on context), both values (4621 and 920) need to be compared against 4485.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Row index 0 has a crowd size of 4621, which is greater than 4485.\n   - Row index 1 has a crowd size of 920, which is less than 4485.\n   - Since not all matches on February 4 have a \"score\" (interpreted as crowd) smaller than 4485 (because one row has a larger value), the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant cells are from the rows where the date is \"4 february\", specifically in the \"crowd\" column.\n- Row index 0, Column: \"crowd\"\n- Row index 1, Column: \"crowd\"\n\nHere's the final JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
