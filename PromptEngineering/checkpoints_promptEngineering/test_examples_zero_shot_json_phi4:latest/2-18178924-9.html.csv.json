    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate if there is an entry in the table where \"wales\" is listed as the opposing team and the corresponding \"against\" value is 9.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: The columns relevant to the claim are:\n   - \"opposing teams\"\n   - \"against\"\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - For each row, check if the \"opposing teams\" column contains \"wales\".\n   - If it does, verify that the corresponding \"against\" value is 9.\n\n3. **Row-by-Row Analysis**:\n\n   - **Row 0**: \n     - Opposing team: \"france\"\n     - Against: 15\n     - Not relevant since the opposing team is not \"wales\".\n\n   - **Row 1**: \n     - Opposing team: \"wales\"\n     - Against: 9\n     - Relevant and matches the claim.\n\n   - **Row 2**:\n     - Opposing team: \"scotland\"\n     - Against: 0\n     - Not relevant since the opposing team is not \"wales\".\n\n   - **Row 3**:\n     - Opposing team: \"ireland\"\n     - Against: 9\n     - Not relevant since the opposing team is not \"wales\".\n\n   - **Row 4**:\n     - Opposing team: \"new zealand\"\n     - Against: 16\n     - Not relevant since the opposing team is not \"wales\".\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The claim is supported by Row 1, where \"wales\" is indeed the opposing team with an \"against\" value of 9.\n\nThus, the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cell information for this verification is from Row 1 in both the \"opposing teams\" and \"against\" columns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opposing teams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim \"twickenham , london have less than 16 against,\" we need to examine each row in the provided table for matches played at \"Twickenham, London\" and check their corresponding \"against\" values.\n\nThe relevant conditions are:\n1. The match must be held at \"venue\": \"Twickenham, London\".\n2. The \"against\" score should be checked if it is less than 16.\n\nLet's analyze the data:\n\n- **Row 0**: Venue is \"Parc des Princes, Paris,\" so this row is not relevant.\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Venue: \"Twickenham, London\"\n  - Against: 9\n  - This satisfies both conditions (venue and against < 16).\n  \n- **Row 2**: Venue is \"Murrayfield, Edinburgh,\" so this row is not relevant.\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Venue: \"Twickenham, London\"\n  - Against: 9\n  - This also satisfies both conditions.\n\n- **Row 4**: \n  - Venue: \"Twickenham, London\"\n  - Against: 16\n  - The against score is not less than 16, so this row does not fully satisfy the condition for \"less than 16\".\n\nThus, rows 1 and 3 are relevant to verify that at least some matches held at Twickenham, London have an \"against\" score of less than 16.\n\nSince there exists a match (or more) with an \"against\" score less than 16, the claim is TRUE based on available data.\n\nThe JSON output should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
