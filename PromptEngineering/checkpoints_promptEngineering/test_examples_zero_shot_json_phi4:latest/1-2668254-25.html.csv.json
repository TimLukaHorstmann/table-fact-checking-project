Therefore, the claim is supported by the table data.\n\nLet's format this information into the required JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"district\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"incumbent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"first elected\"}\n  ]\n}\n``` \n\nIn this JSON object:\n- The `answer` is set to \"TRUE\" as the claim matches the table data.\n- The `relevant_cells` list includes objects with the `row_index` of 18 (as it corresponds to Virginia district 19 in a zero-based index system) and the column names that are relevant for verifying the claim: \"district\", \"incumbent\", and \"first elected\".",
