We are looking for occurrences where the number of games drawn is greater than zero.\n2. For these occasions, we need to check if the goal differences match \"34 - 25\" or \"36 - 29.\"\n3. Finally, we verify that there are only two such occurrences.\n\nLet's analyze each row in the table:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Drawn: 0\n  - Goal Difference: \"51 - 10\"\n  - This does not meet any of the conditions as no game was drawn.\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Drawn: 0\n  - Goal Difference: \"40 - 13\"\n  - This row also does not meet any of the conditions since there were no draws.\n\n- **Row 2**: \n  - Drawn: 0\n  - Goal Difference: \"41 - 19\"\n  - No draws, so it doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Drawn: 1\n  - Goal Difference: \"34 - 25\"\n  - This row meets both conditions (draw occurred and goal difference is \"34 - 25\").\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Drawn: 1\n  - Goal Difference: \"36 - 29\"\n  - This row also satisfies both conditions (draw occurred and goal difference is \"36 - 29\").\n\n- **Row 5**: \n  - Drawn: 0\n  - Goal Difference: \"32 - 27\"\n  - No draws here.\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Drawn: 0\n  - Goal Difference: \"17 - 68\"\n  - Again, no draws in this row.\n\n- **Row 7**: \n  - Drawn: 0\n  - Goal Difference: \"11 - 71\"\n  - No draws occur here either.\n\nNow, let's summarize the findings:\n- We found two instances where a draw occurred (Rows 3 and 4).\n- In Row 3, the goal difference was \"34 - 25.\"\n- In Row 4, the goal difference was \"36 - 29.\"\n\nThe claim is true since there are exactly two occasions with these specific conditions.\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table data provided in the JSON format. The claim states:\n\n\"There be 3 time when the point be 7 and the number of loss be 3 each time.\"\n\nLet's break down this claim into two conditions that must both be satisfied:\n1. Points = 7\n2. Lost (number of losses) = 3\n\nWe need to find rows in the table where both these conditions are met simultaneously.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:**\n   - The column for \"points\" corresponds to the index `4` in the data array.\n   - The column for \"lost\" (number of losses) corresponds to the index `2`.\n\n2. **Iterate Through Each Row:**\n\n   We will check each row to see if both conditions are met:\n\n   - **Row 0:** Points = 12, Lost = 1\n     - Does not satisfy either condition.\n\n   - **Row 1:** Points = 12, Lost = 1\n     - Does not satisfy either condition.\n\n   - **Row 2:** Points = 10, Lost = 2\n     - Does not satisfy either condition.\n\n   - **Row 3:** Points = 7, Lost = 3\n     - Satisfies both conditions. (Relevant row)\n\n   - **Row 4:** Points = 7, Lost = 3\n     - Satisfies both conditions. (Relevant row)\n\n   - **Row 5:** Points = 6, Lost = 4\n     - Does not satisfy either condition.\n\n   - **Row 6:** Points = 2, Lost = 6\n     - Does not satisfy either condition.\n\n   - **Row 7:** Points = 0, Lost = 7\n     - Does not satisfy either condition.\n\n3. **Count the Instances:**\n\n   We found that there are only two rows (rows 3 and 4) where both conditions are met simultaneously (Points = 7 and Lost = 3).\n\nThe claim states that this should happen \"3 time,\" but we only identified it happening twice.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false because the condition of having points equal to 7 and losses equal to 3 occurs only two times, not three as stated in the claim.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
