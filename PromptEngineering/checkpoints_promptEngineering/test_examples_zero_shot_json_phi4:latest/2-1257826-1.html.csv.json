    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate it against the data in the table. The claim states: \"the date of the game that have a goal of 3 be january 20 2001\".\n\nHere's how we can verify this:\n\n1. **Identify rows where the goal number is 3**: We look for entries with \"goal\" equal to 3.\n2. **Check the corresponding dates for these entries**: Verify if the date associated with a goal of 3 matches \"january 20 2001\".\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- Row 0: Goal = 1, Date = \"17 january 2001\"\n- Row 1: Goal = 2, Date = \"20 january 2001\"\n- Row 2: Goal = 3, Date = \"20 january 2001\"\n- Row 3: Goal = 4, Date = \"15 march 2001\"\n- Row 4: Goal = 5, Date = \"14 july 2004\"\n- Row 5: Goal = 6, Date = \"17 november 2004\"\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- The only entry with a goal of 3 is in row 2.\n- The date for this entry (goal number 3) is \"20 january 2001\".\n\nThe claim states that the date should be \"january 20 2001\". However, the format in the table is \"20 january 2001\", which is equivalent but not an exact string match.\n\nSince we are looking for a strict string match and the format differs, the claim does not hold true as per the data provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
