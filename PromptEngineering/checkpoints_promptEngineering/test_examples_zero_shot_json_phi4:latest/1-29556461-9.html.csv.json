This too exceeds 12.\n   - For March 17 against Penn State, the highest point total is shared: \"moore / fernandez - 23\". Both exceed 12.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The maximum point total in any of these games is 24 (by Allen on March 5). Therefore, the claim that the highest point total for any player in one game is 12 is false.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - Row 0, Column \"high points\"\n   - Row 1, Column \"high points\"\n   - Row 2, Column \"high points\"\n   - Row 3, Column \"high points\"\n   - Row 4, Column \"high points\"\n\nThe final JSON object is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if the most points scored by a player in one game for the team (presumably \"the owl\" refers to this team) is 74.\n\nThe relevant information from the table would be found in the \"high points\" column. This column indicates the highest number of points scored by a player in each game:\n\n1. In Game 29 against UMass, Fernandez scored 19 points.\n2. In Game 30 against La Salle, Allen scored 24 points.\n3. In Game 31 against La Salle, Moore scored 23 points.\n4. In Game 32 against Richmond, Wyatt scored 15 points.\n5. In Game 33 against Penn State, both Moore and Fernandez each scored 23 points.\n\nThe highest score from these entries is 24 points by Allen in Game 30. There is no entry where a player scored 74 points or more.\n\nThus, the claim that \"the most point score by the owl in 1 game be 74\" is false.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this are those under the \"high points\" column across all games:\n\n- Row Index 0: High Points = 19\n- Row Index 1: High Points = 24\n- Row Index 2: High Points = 23\n- Row Index 3: High Points = 15\n- Row Index 4: High Points = 23\n\nHere is the JSON representation of the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
