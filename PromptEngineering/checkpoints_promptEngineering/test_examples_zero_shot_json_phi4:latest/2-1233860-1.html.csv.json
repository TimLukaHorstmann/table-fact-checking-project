    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify several conditions from the given table:\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. Ivor Bueb used an \"Alta Straight-4\" engine.\n2. This occurred 2 times between 1958 and 1959.\n\n### Verification Steps:\n1. **Identify Entries for Ivor Bueb**:\n   - The claim mentions \"Ivor Bueb,\" but the table does not list any entrant by this name. Therefore, there are no entries directly linked to him in the data provided.\n\n2. **Check Usage of \"Alta Straight-4\" Engine**:\n   - We need to find instances where the engine is listed as \"Alta Straight-4\".\n\n3. **Timeframe Verification (1958 and 1959)**:\n   - We will check if any entries with \"Alta Straight-4\" fall within the years 1958 or 1959.\n\n### Table Analysis:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Year: 1957\n  - Engine: Alta Straight-4\n  - Not within the specified timeframe (1958-1959).\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Year: 1957\n  - Engine: Maserati Straight-6\n  - Not relevant as it doesn't match the engine type or timeframe.\n\n- **Row 2**: \n  - Year: 1958\n  - Engine: Alta Straight-4\n  - Matches the year and engine type criteria.\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Year: 1958\n  - Engine: Climax Straight-4\n  - Not relevant as it doesn't match the engine type.\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Year: 1959\n  - Engine: Climax Straight-4\n  - Not relevant as it doesn't match the engine type.\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Year: 1959\n  - Engine: Borgward Straight-4\n  - Not relevant as it doesn't match the engine type.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- There is only one instance of \"Alta Straight-4\" between 1958 and 1959 (in row 2).\n- The claim specifies that Ivor Bueb used this engine, but there is no data linking Ivor Bueb to any entry.\n- Therefore, the conditions of the claim are not fully met.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"engine\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
