    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Trabzon's stadium capacity is true or false, let's evaluate the relevant information provided in the table.\n\n### Claim:\n\"In Trabzon, the lowest capacity match have a capacity of 11'000.\"\n\n### Steps for Evaluation:\n\n1. **Identify the Row Pertaining to Trabzon:**\n   - Look for entries with \"Trabzon\" in the \"city\" column or related clubs known to be from Trabzon.\n   \n2. **Locate Relevant Data:**\n   - The table has a row where:\n     - Stadium: \"new trabzon stadium\"\n     - Capacity: 41,513\n     - City: \"trabzon\"\n     - Club: \"trabzonspor\"\n\n3. **Verify the Claim Against the Table:**\n   - The claim states that the lowest capacity match in Trabzon is 11,000.\n   - From the table, we see that the stadium in Trabzon has a capacity of 41,513.\n   - There are no other stadiums listed for Trabzon in the data provided.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim suggests a capacity of 11,000 which is not present in the table for any Trabzon stadium or match.\n   - Therefore, the information contradicts the claim since the only recorded capacity for Trabzon is much higher than 11,000.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the evaluation above, the claim is false. The relevant cell to verify this is the one that contains the capacity of the stadium in Trabzon.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"capacity\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
