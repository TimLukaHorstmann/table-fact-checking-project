This satisfies the first condition of the claim.\n\n2. **\"more than 1 silver\":**\n   - Again, we refer to the same row for Italy.\n   - Under the \"silver\" column (index 3), the value is `3`.\n   - Since `3` is indeed more than `1`, this satisfies the second condition of the claim.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied based on the data in the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify the claim are:\n- The \"gold\" column for Italy (row index 6).\n- The \"silver\" column for Italy (row index 6).\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
