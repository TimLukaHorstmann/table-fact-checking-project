    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"5 of the list games take place before February 21, 2008,\" we need to identify the relevant data points in the table and check their dates against February 21, 2008.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The relevant column for this evaluation is \"date\" since it contains information about when each game occurred.\n\n2. **Extract Data**: Extract the date from each row to see which games occurred before February 21, 2008.\n\n3. **Compare Dates**:\n   - Convert all dates into a comparable format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD) for easy comparison.\n   - Count how many of these dates are earlier than \"2008-02-21\".\n\n4. **List the Relevant Rows**: Identify rows where the date is before February 21, 2008.\n\n### Data Analysis:\n\nHere's the conversion and analysis of each row's date:\n\n1. **3 February 2008** \u2192 2008-02-03 (Before)\n2. **4 February 2008** \u2192 2008-02-04 (Before)\n3. **6 February 2008** \u2192 2008-02-06 (Before)\n4. **8 February 2008** \u2192 2008-02-08 (Before)\n5. **10 February 2008** \u2192 2008-02-10 (Before)\n6. **11 February 2008** \u2192 2008-02-11 (Before)\n7. **13 February 2008** \u2192 2008-02-13 (Before)\n8. **14 February 2008** \u2192 2008-02-14 (Before)\n9. **20 February 2008** \u2192 2008-02-20 (Before)\n10. **22 February 2008** \u2192 2008-02-22 (After)\n11. **24 February 2008** \u2192 2008-02-24 (After)\n12. **25 February 2008** \u2192 2008-02-25 (After)\n13. **28 February 2008** \u2192 2008-02-28 (After)\n14. **29 February 2008** \u2192 2008-02-29 (After)\n\n### Counting:\n\nFrom the analysis above, games that took place before February 21, 2008, occur in rows with indices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
