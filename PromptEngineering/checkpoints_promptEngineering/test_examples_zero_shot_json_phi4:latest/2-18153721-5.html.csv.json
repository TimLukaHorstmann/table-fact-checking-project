    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the given table and check the specific conditions outlined in the claim: \n\n1. Identify if there is a three-player tie at 2nd place.\n2. Check if these players are even to par.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n#### 1. Checking for a Three-Player Tie at 2nd Place\n- The table has columns \"place\", \"player\", \"country\", \"score\", and \"to par\".\n- We need to find rows where the \"place\" column indicates a tie at 2nd place.\n- In golf tournaments, ties are typically represented with ranks like \"t1\", \"t3\", etc., where the number following 't' indicates how many players share that rank.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Rows with `place = \"t1\"` have two players: David Graham and Sandy Lyle (both at 139, -1 to par).\n- Rows with `place = \"t3\"` have three players: Tony Johnstone, Christy O'Connor Jnr, and D A Weibring (all at 140, even to par).\n\nSince there are three players tied for the rank indicated by \"t3\", they are in a tie for 2nd place. \n\n#### 2. Checking if These Players Are Even to Par\n- The claim specifies that these players should be \"even to par\".\n- From the table:\n  - Tony Johnstone: To par = \"e\"\n  - Christy O'Connor Jnr: To par = \"e\"\n  - D A Weibring: To par = \"e\"\n\nAll three players at the tie for 2nd place (rank \"t3\") are indeed even to par.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe conditions outlined in the claim are met:\n- There is a three-player tie at 2nd place.\n- These players have scores that are even to par.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells from the table for this verification are those corresponding to rows with `place = \"t3\"` and columns \"player\", \"to par\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
