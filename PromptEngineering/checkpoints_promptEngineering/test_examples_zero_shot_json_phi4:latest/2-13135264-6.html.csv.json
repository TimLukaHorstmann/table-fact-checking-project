    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"detroit have 1 of the lowest visitor score this season\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table and extract relevant information.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Visitor Games**: \n   - Look at each row in the data where \"detroit\" is listed as a visitor (i.e., under the column \"visitor\").\n\n2. **Extract Scores for Detroit as Visitors**:\n   - For these rows, extract the scores from the \"score\" column to determine how many goals Detroit scored.\n\n3. **Compare Visitor Scores**:\n   - Compare Detroit's scores in their visitor games with each other and potentially with other teams' visitor scores if such data were available.\n   - Since we are only given Detroit's data, we will compare among their own visitor games.\n\n4. **Determine the Lowest Score**:\n   - Identify the lowest score among the games where Detroit was the visitor.\n\n5. **Check Frequency of Lowest Scores**:\n   - Determine how many times this lowest score occurs.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Visitor Games for Detroit**:\n  - January 3: Anaheim vs Detroit, Score: 1 - 3\n  - January 10: Boston vs Detroit, Score: 1 - 2\n  - January 19: San Jose vs Detroit, Score: 1 - 2\n  - January 21: Anaheim vs Detroit, Score: 2 - 2\n  - January 22: Los Angeles vs Detroit, Score: 5 - 4\n  - January 24: Phoenix vs Detroit, Score: 2 - 5\n  - January 26: Dallas vs Detroit, Score: 2 - 2\n  - January 31: Carolina vs Detroit, Score: 4 - 4\n\n- **Scores by Detroit as Visitor**:\n  - Against Anaheim (Jan 3): 1 goal\n  - Against Boston (Jan 10): 1 goal\n  - Against San Jose (Jan 19): 1 goal\n  - Against Anaheim again (Jan 21): 2 goals\n  - Against Los Angeles (Jan 22): 4 goals\n  - Against Phoenix (Jan 24): 2 goals\n  - Against Dallas (Jan 26): 2 goals\n  - Against Carolina (Jan 31): 4 goals\n\n- **Lowest Score**:\n  - The lowest score Detroit achieved in these visitor games is 1 goal, which occurred three times (against Anaheim on Jan 3, Boston on Jan 10, and San Jose on Jan 19).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that Detroit has \"one of the lowest visitor scores this season.\" Since Detroit scored 1 goal in three different games as a visitor, it is not unique to have only one occurrence of the lowest score. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
