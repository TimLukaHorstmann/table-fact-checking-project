    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"more than half of the away teams have a score greater than 10,\" we need to focus on the scores for each away team and determine how many of them exceed a score of 10.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Identify the relevant column: We are interested in the \"away team score\" since it pertains to the performance of the away teams.\n2. Extract the data from this column for each row in the table.\n3. Convert these scores into numerical values and compare them against the threshold (a score greater than 10).\n4. Count how many away teams meet this condition.\n\n### Data Analysis:\n- **Row 0**: St Kilda's score is \"9.11\". The number before the dot is 9, which means it is less than 10.\n- **Row 1**: North Melbourne's score is \"9.12\". The number before the dot is 9, which means it is less than 10.\n- **Row 2**: Richmond's score is \"17.9\". The number before the dot is 17, which means it is greater than 10.\n- **Row 3**: South Melbourne's score is \"8.15\". The number before the dot is 8, which means it is less than 10.\n- **Row 4**: Geelong's score is \"15.8\". The number before the dot is 15, which means it is greater than 10.\n- **Row 5**: Melbourne's score is \"8.10\". The number before the dot is 8, which means it is less than 10.\n\n### Counting:\nFrom the analysis above, two away teams (Richmond and Geelong) have scores greater than 10 out of six total matches.\n\nTo determine if more than half the away teams meet this criterion, we calculate:\n- Total number of games = 6\n- More than half would require at least 4 away teams to score greater than 10.\n\nSince only 2 out of 6 teams have scores greater than 10, the claim is not supported.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe answer to the claim \"more than half of the away team have a score greater than 10\" is FALSE. The relevant cells are those containing the \"away team score.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the average of all the home team scores be less than 12\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table provided in JSON format.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: The column related to \"home team score\" contains the values necessary for this calculation. We will extract these values and convert them into a numerical format to compute their average.\n\n2. **Extract Scores**:\n   - Home Team Scores:\n     - Footscray: 14.7\n     - Fitzroy: 16.14\n     - Essendon: 13.12\n     - Carlton: 20.8\n     - Hawthorn: 19.14\n     - Collingwood: 10.13\n\n3. **Convert Scores to Total Points**:\n   - The scores are given in a format \"X.Y\" where X is the number of goals (each goal equals 6 points) and Y is the number of behinds (each behind equals 1 point). We need to calculate the total score for each team.\n     - Footscray: \\(14 \\times 6 + 7 = 91\\)\n     - Fitzroy: \\(16 \\times 6 + 14 = 110\\)\n     - Essendon: \\(13 \\times 6 + 12 = 90\\)\n     - Carlton: \\(20 \\times 6 + 8 = 128\\)\n     - Hawthorn: \\(19 \\times 6 + 14 = 128\\)\n     - Collingwood: \\(10 \\times 6 + 13 = 73\\)\n\n4. **Calculate the Average**:\n   - First, sum all the total points: \\(91 + 110 + 90 + 128 + 128 + 73 = 620\\).\n   - Then, divide by the number of scores (6 teams): \\(\\frac{620}{6} \\approx 103.33\\).\n\n5. **Convert Average to \"Goals.Behinds\" Format**:\n   - To express this average as a score in the format \"X.Y\":\n     - Divide the total points by 6 to get the number of goals: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{103.33}{6} \\right\\rfloor = 17\\) (goals).\n     - Calculate remaining points for behinds: \\(103.33 - (17 \\times 6) = 5.33\\), which rounds down to 5 (behinds).\n\n   Thus, the average score is approximately \"17.5\".\n\n6. **Compare with Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the average should be less than \"12\" in terms of goals and behinds.\n   - Convert \"12\" into total points: \\(12 \\times 6 = 72\\).\n   - Our calculated average score is \"17.5\", which translates to \\(17 \\times 6 + 5 = 107\\) points, much higher than 72.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim that the average of all home team scores be less than \"12\" is FALSE.\n\n8. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells are those containing the \"home team score\" values for each row from 0 to 5.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
