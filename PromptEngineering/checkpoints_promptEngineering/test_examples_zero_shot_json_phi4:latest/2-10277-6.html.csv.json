    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"bulworth be nominate in 1999\", we need to verify two main aspects from the table:\n\n1. The project \"bulworth\" should have a corresponding entry.\n2. This entry must indicate that it was nominated in the year 1999.\n\nLet's examine the relevant columns and data in the table for these conditions:\n\n- **Project Name**: We need to find an entry where the \"project\" column contains \"bulworth\".\n- **Year**: The year associated with this project should be 1999.\n- **Result**: For the nomination, the result should be \"nominated\".\n\nNow, let's go through the data row by row:\n\n1. Row index 0: \n   - Year: 1988\n   - Project: \"the untouchables\"\n   - Result: \"won\"\n   - This does not match the project name or year.\n\n2. Row index 1:\n   - Year: 1995\n   - Project: \"wolf\"\n   - Result: \"nominated\"\n   - This does not match the project name or year.\n\n3. Row index 2:\n   - Year: 1997\n   - Project: \"the star maker\"\n   - Result: \"nominated\"\n   - This does not match the project name or year.\n\n4. **Row index 3**:\n   - Year: 1999\n   - Project: \"bulworth\"\n   - Result: \"nominated\"\n   - This matches both the project name and the year, and confirms that it was nominated.\n\n5. Row index 4:\n   - Year: 2007\n   - Project: \"once upon a time in the west\"\n   - Result: \"won\"\n   - This does not match the project name or year.\n\n6. Row index 5:\n   - Year: 2009\n   - Project: \"the good , the bad and the ugly\"\n   - Result: \"won\"\n   - This does not match the project name or year.\n\nThe relevant data confirming the claim is found in row index 3, where all conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"project\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
