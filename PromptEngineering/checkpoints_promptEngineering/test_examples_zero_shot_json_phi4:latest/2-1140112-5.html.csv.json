    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the given table data and the specific details mentioned in the claim.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\nThe claim states: \"the Caen circuit be commonly use as the Aintree circuit in the 1956 Formula One season.\"\n\n**Key Points of Analysis:**\n1. **Circuits Mentioned:** The circuits involved are Caen and Aintree.\n2. **Common Use:** We need to determine if these two circuits were interchangeably used or mentioned together in the context of the races listed.\n\n### Table Data Analysis:\nWe will examine each race entry in the table for mentions of either the \"Caen\" circuit or the \"Aintree\" circuit:\n\n1. **Row 0:**\n   - Circuit: Mendoza\n   - Not relevant to the claim as neither Caen nor Aintree is mentioned.\n\n2. **Row 1:**\n   - Circuit: Goodwood\n   - Not relevant for the same reason as above.\n\n3. **Row 2:**\n   - Circuit: Syracuse\n   - Not relevant for the same reason as above.\n\n4. **Row 3:**\n   - Circuit: Aintree\n   - This row is relevant because it mentions \"Aintree.\"\n\n5. **Row 4:**\n   - Circuit: Silverstone\n   - Not relevant to the claim.\n\n6. **Row 5:**\n   - Circuit: Posillipo\n   - Not relevant to the claim.\n\n7. **Row 6:**\n   - Circuit: Aintree\n   - This row is relevant because it mentions \"Aintree.\"\n\n8. **Row 7:**\n   - Circuit: Snetterton\n   - Not relevant for the same reason as above.\n\n9. **Row 8:**\n   - Circuit: Caen\n   - This row is relevant because it mentions \"Caen.\"\n\n10. **Row 9:**\n    - Circuit: Goodwood\n    - Not relevant to the claim.\n\n11. **Row 10:**\n    - Circuit: Brands Hatch\n    - Not relevant for the same reason as above.\n\n### Analysis of Relevance:\n- **Aintree Circuit:** Mentioned in rows 3 and 6.\n- **Caen Circuit:** Mentioned only in row 8.\n\nFrom this analysis, we observe that:\n- Aintree is mentioned twice but there are no records or any implication of it being interchangeably used with Caen.\n- Caen is mentioned once and there's no indication that it was commonly referred to as Aintree during the 1956 Formula One season in these entries.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim that \"the Caen circuit be commonly use as the Aintree circuit\" cannot be substantiated by this data. The table does not provide any evidence or context suggesting a common interchangeability between the two circuits, nor does it suggest any shared identity beyond their separate listings.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information in the table:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"circuit\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"circuit\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"circuit\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
