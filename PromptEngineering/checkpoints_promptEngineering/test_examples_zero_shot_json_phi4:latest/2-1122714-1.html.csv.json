This confirms that James Hunt started from grid position 2.\n\n- **Number of Laps Completed**:\n  - Again, in the same row (index 0), under the column \"laps,\" the value is 73. This indicates that James Hunt completed 73 laps.\n\nSince all conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data in this row:\n\n- The driver is James Hunt.\n- He started on grid position 2.\n- He completed 73 laps.\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the information provided in the table.
