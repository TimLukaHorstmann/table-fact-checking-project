The name of the partnering player (to verify if it is Horia Tec\u0103u).\n2. The opponents in the final match (to see if they include Marcelo Melo and Andr\u00e9 S\u00e1).\n\nWe will look through each row to find where Horia Tec\u0103u is listed as a partner, then check the corresponding opponents in the final for that entry.\n\nLet's examine each row:\n\n- **Row 0:**\n  - Partnering: \"menno oosting\" (not relevant)\n  \n- **Row 1:**\n  - Partnering: \"mikhail youzhny\" (not relevant)\n\n- **Row 2:**\n  - Partnering: \"victor h\u0103nescu\" (not relevant)\n\n- **Row 3:**\n  - Partnering: \"alexander waske\" (not relevant)\n\n- **Row 4:**\n  - Partnering: \"horia tec\u0103u\"\n  - Opponents in final: \"marcelo melo andr\u00e9 s\u00e1\"\n\nIn row 4, Horia Tec\u0103u is listed as the partner, and the opponents in the final match are indeed Marcelo Melo and Andr\u00e9 S\u00e1.
