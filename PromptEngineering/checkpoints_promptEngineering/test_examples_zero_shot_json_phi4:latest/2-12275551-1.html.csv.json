    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Rhona Robertson and Tammy Jenkins win the event more than any other team, win 5 times,\" we need to inspect the \"women's doubles\" column of the table for occurrences where both Rhona Robertson and Tammy Jenkins are listed as winners.\n\nLet's examine each row in the data:\n\n- **1990**: \"Rhona Robertson Lynne Scutt\"\n- **1991**: \"Rhonda Cator Anna Oi Chan Lao\"\n- **1992**: \"Rhona Robertson Tammy Jenkins\" (First win for Rhona Robertson and Tammy Jenkins)\n- **1993**: \"Rhona Robertson Liao Yue Jin\"\n- **1994**: \"Lisa Campbell Amanda Hardy\"\n- **1995**: \"Rhona Robertson Tammy Jenkins\" (Second win for Rhona Robertson and Tammy Jenkins)\n- **1996**: \"Rhona Robertson Tammy Jenkins\" (Third win for Rhona Robertson and Tammy Jenkins)\n- **1997**: \"Rhona Robertson Tammy Jenkins\" (Fourth win for Rhona Robertson and Tammy Jenkins)\n- **1998**: \"Rhona Robertson Tammy Jenkins\" (Fifth win for Rhona Robertson and Tammy Jenkins)\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that Rhona Robertson and Tammy Jenkins appear together as winners in the \"women's doubles\" category exactly five times: 1992, 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998.\n\nNext, verify if any other team has won more than them:\n\n- Checking each entry for other teams does not show any combination winning more than five times. Thus, no other pair matches or exceeds their record of five wins together.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data: Rhona Robertson and Tammy Jenkins win the event more than any other team with a total of 5 wins.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are in the \"women's doubles\" column for row indices 1 through 8. \n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
