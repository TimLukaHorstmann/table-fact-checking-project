    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down the relevant parts of the claim and compare them with the data in the table:\n\n1. **Champion**: The claim mentions \"jenny shin\" as the champion. We need to find an entry where the \"champion\" column matches \"jenny shin\".\n\n2. **Winner's Share**: According to the claim, her winner's share was 14,000 dollars when she won. So we must check if the \"winner 's share\" for that row is indeed 14,000.\n\n3. **Year of Victory**: The claim does not specify a year, but it's logical to verify the entire context by confirming the specific entry where \"jenny shin\" was the champion and ensuring all details align with the claim.\n\nNow let's identify the relevant row in the table:\n\n- Looking through the data, we find:\n  - In the year 2010, \"jenny shin\" is listed as the champion.\n  - The winner's share for that entry is 15,400 dollars.\n\nThe claim states Jenny Shin's winner's share was 14,000 dollars, but according to the table, her actual winner's share was 15,400 dollars. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNext, we identify the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- **Row Index**: The row where \"jenny shin\" appears as the champion is at index 4 (0-based indexing).\n- **Column Name for Champion**: \"champion\"\n- **Column Name for Winner's Share**: \"winner 's share\"\n\nThus, the JSON object should look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
