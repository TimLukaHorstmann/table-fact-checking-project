    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about B\u00f6rje Jansson's speed being 90.57 mph is true or false, we need to locate his entry in the provided table and verify the information against the claim.\n\n1. Identify the relevant column:\n   - The claim pertains to \"speed,\" so this is our target column for verification.\n\n2. Locate B\u00f6rje Jansson's row in the data:\n   - We scan through each row of the `data` array until we find an entry with \"B\u00f6rje Jansson\" as the rider name.\n   - In this case, B\u00f6rje Jansson appears in the 8th position in our data list (index 7, since indexing starts at 0).\n\n3. Verify the speed value:\n   - For row index 7, we check the \"speed\" column to see if it matches the claim of \"90.57 mph.\"\n\n4. Compare and determine validity:\n   - The speed recorded for B\u00f6rje Jansson in the table is indeed \"90.57 mph,\" which perfectly matches the claim.\n\nSince all conditions are met, the claim is verified as true.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"speed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. Whether B\u00f6rje Jansson's country is listed as \"United Kingdom\".\n2. Whether B\u00f6rje Jansson's speed is 90.57 mph.\n\nLet's break down each step of verification using the relevant data from the table:\n\n- We are looking for the entry corresponding to B\u00f6rje Jansson. By examining the \"rider\" column, we find that he is listed in row index 7.\n- In row 7:\n  - The \"country\" value is \"Sweden\".\n  - The \"speed\" value is \"90.57 mph\".\n\nFrom this information:\n\n- The claim states B\u00f6rje Jansson is from the United Kingdom, but according to the table, he is from Sweden. Therefore, this part of the claim is false.\n- The speed stated in the claim (90.57 mph) matches the speed listed in the table for B\u00f6rje Jansson.\n\nSince one condition of the claim is incorrect (the country), the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells that need to be checked are:\n- \"country\" at row index 7.\n- \"speed\" at row index 7.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"speed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
