    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim about John Miles in the provided table, we need to evaluate each condition stated in the claim against the relevant data in the table.\n\nThe claim states:\n\"John Miles has BRM as his constructor and retires after 3 laps on grid 14.\"\n\nLet's break down this claim into individual components and verify them with the corresponding cells from the table:\n\n1. **Driver Name:**\n   - The claim mentions \"John Miles.\" We need to find an entry in the table where the driver is \"john miles.\"\n   - From the data, we find:\n     ```json\n     [\n       \"john miles\",\n       \"lotus - ford\",\n       3,\n       \"engine\",\n       14\n     ]\n     ```\n   - This corresponds to row index 12.\n\n2. **Constructor:**\n   - The claim states that John Miles's constructor is \"BRM.\"\n   - From the same entry:\n     - Constructor: \"lotus - ford\"\n   - Clearly, this does not match \"BRM.\"\n\n3. **Laps Completed:**\n   - The claim mentions that John Miles retires after 3 laps.\n   - From the data:\n     - Laps: 3\n   - This condition is satisfied.\n\n4. **Grid Position:**\n   - According to the claim, John Miles started on grid 14.\n   - From the data:\n     - Grid: 14\n   - This condition is also satisfied.\n\nBased on these evaluations:\n\n- The laps completed and grid position are correct as per the claim (\"3\" laps and \"grid 14\").\n- However, the constructor is incorrect. The table states that John Miles's constructor is \"lotus - ford,\" not \"BRM.\"\n\nSince one of the key conditions (constructor) in the claim does not match with the data from the table, we can conclude that the claim as a whole is false.\n\nNow, let's list the relevant cells used to verify the claim:\n- Driver Name: row index 12, column name \"driver\"\n- Constructor: row index 12, column name \"constructor\"\n- Laps Completed: row index 12, column name \"laps\"\n- Grid Position: row index 12, column name \"grid\"\n\nBased on this analysis, we can construct the JSON response as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
