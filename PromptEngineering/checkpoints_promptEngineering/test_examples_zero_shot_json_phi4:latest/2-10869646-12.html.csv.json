    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine each row in the provided table and check for two specific conditions related to the claim: \n\n1. Identify which games were played at \"Princes Park\" (since the claim specifically mentions this venue).\n2. Compare the crowd sizes of these games against other games to determine if Princes Park recorded the highest attendance.\n\nThe relevant information from the table includes:\n- The column \"venue,\" which specifies where each game was held.\n- The column \"crowd,\" which provides the number of attendees at each game.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify Games at Princes Park:**\n   - From the data provided, only one row has \"Princes Park\" as the venue:\n     - Row 1 (Index 0 in zero-based numbering): \n       - Home Team: Hawthorn\n       - Away Team: Richmond\n       - Venue: Princes Park\n       - Crowd: 15,710\n\n2. **Check Attendance for All Games to Determine Highest Crowd:**\n   - Compare the crowd size of the game at Princes Park against the crowd sizes of all other games.\n   - Here are the relevant \"crowd\" values from each row:\n     - Row 0 (Arden Street Oval): 9,016\n     - **Row 1 (Princes Park)**: 15,710\n     - Row 2 (Junction Oval): 12,519\n     - Row 3 (Windy Hill): 25,867\n     - Row 4 (MCG): 23,336\n     - Row 5 (VFL Park): 16,320\n\n3. **Determine the Highest Crowd:**\n   - The highest crowd is found in Row 3 at Windy Hill with a crowd of 25,867.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe game held at Princes Park had a crowd of 15,710, which is not the highest attendance recorded among all games on June 22, 1974. Therefore, the claim that \"Princes Park record[ed] the highest crowd participation\" during this date in the VFL season is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- Row 1, \"venue\": to confirm it was Princes Park\n- Row 1, \"crowd\": to get the attendance at Princes Park\n- All rows, \"crowd\": to compare against all other games\n\nThe relevant cells for this analysis are as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
