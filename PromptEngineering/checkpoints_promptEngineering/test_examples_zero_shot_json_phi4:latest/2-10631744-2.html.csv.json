We'll extract and compute the number of years for each coach, then sort them by the length of service to see where Bud Foster ranks.\n\n1. **Extracting Years of Service:**\n\n   - James C Elsom: 1898 - 1904 \u2192 \\(1904 - 1898 = 6\\) years\n   - Emmett Angell: 1904 - 1908 \u2192 \\(1908 - 1904 = 4\\) years\n   - Haskell Noyes: 1908 - 1911 \u2192 \\(1911 - 1908 = 3\\) years\n   - Walter Meanwell (First Term): 1911 - 1917 \u2192 \\(1917 - 1911 = 6\\) years\n   - Guy Lowman: 1917 - 1920 \u2192 \\(1920 - 1917 = 3\\) years\n   - Walter Meanwell (Second Term): 1920 - 1934 \u2192 \\(1934 - 1920 = 14\\) years\n   - Bud Foster: 1934 - 1959 \u2192 \\(1959 - 1934 = 25\\) years\n   - John E Erickson: 1959 - 1968 \u2192 \\(1968 - 1959 = 9\\) years\n   - John Powless: 1968 - 1976 \u2192 \\(1976 - 1968 = 8\\) years\n   - Bill Cofield: 1976 - 1982 \u2192 \\(1982 - 1976 = 6\\) years\n   - Steve Yoder: 1982 - 1992 \u2192 \\(1992 - 1982 = 10\\) years\n   - Stu Jackson: 1992 - 1994 \u2192 \\(1994 - 1992 = 2\\) years\n   - Stan Van Gundy: 1994 - 1995 \u2192 \\(1995 - 1994 = 1\\) year\n   - Dick Bennett: 1995 - 2000 \u2192 \\(2000 - 1995 = 5\\) years\n   - Brad Soderberg: 2000 - 2001 \u2192 \\(2001 - 2000 = 1\\) year\n   - Bo Ryan: 2001 - Present (2013 in context) \u2192 \\(2013 - 2001 = 12\\) years\n\n2. **Sorting by Tenure Length:**\n\n   We'll list the coaches along with their calculated tenures and sort them:\n\n   - Walter Meanwell (Second Term): 14 years\n   - Bud Foster: 25 years\n   - Bo Ryan: 12 years\n   - Steve Yoder: 10 years\n   - John E Erickson: 9 years\n   - John Powless: 8 years\n   - James C Elsom, Walter Meanwell (First Term), Bill Cofield: 6 years each\n   - Dick Bennett: 5 years\n   - Emmett Angell: 4 years\n   - Haskell Noyes, Guy Lowman: 3 years each\n   - Stu Jackson: 2 years\n   - Stan Van Gundy, Brad Soderberg: 1 year each\n\n3. **Determining Bud Foster's Rank:**\n\n   From the sorted list, we see that:\n   - Walter Meanwell (Second Term) has the longest tenure with 14 years.\n   - Bud Foster follows next with 25 years.\n\nThus, Bud Foster indeed has the second-longest tenure as a coach.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n\n   We need to check the \"years\" column for each relevant row to compute these durations:\n   - Walter Meanwell (Second Term): Row index 5\n   - Bud Foster: Row index 6\n   - Bo Ryan: Row index 16\n\nThe claim is TRUE.
