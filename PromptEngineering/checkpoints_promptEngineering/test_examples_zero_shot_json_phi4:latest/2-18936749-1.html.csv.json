Let's identify and compare these values:\n\n- For Bremen:\n  - According to the data, Bremen is in row 0 (first entry).\n  - The \"year joined\" for Bremen is listed as 1989.\n\n- For Culver Community:\n  - According to the data, Culver Community is in row 1 (second entry).\n  - The \"year joined\" for Culver Community is listed as 1977.\n\nNow, calculate the difference between these two years:\n\n\\[ \\text{Year Bremen Joined} - \\text{Year Culver Community Joined} = 1989 - 1977 = 12 \\]\n\nThe calculated difference of 12 years matches exactly with what the claim states.
