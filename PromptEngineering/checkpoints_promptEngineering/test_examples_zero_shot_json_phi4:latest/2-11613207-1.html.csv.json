This corresponds to:\n  - Row index: 12\n  - Event: \"CJ INVITATIONAL\"\n  \nThe claim incorrectly identifies the \"HEARLD KYJ TOUR CHAMPIONSHIP\" as having the prize money offered in American dollars, whereas the \"CJ INVITATIONAL\" actually has its prize fund in USD.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim is FALSE because it misidentifies which tournament offers prize money in US Dollars. The \"CJ INVITATIONAL\" is the only competition with a prize fund listed in USD.\n\nHere's the JSON output based on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"prize fund ( krw )\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"prize fund ( krw )\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n- Row index 12 is relevant because it contains the USD prize for the \"CJ INVITATIONAL\".\n- Row index 13 is relevant to confirm that no other competitions list their prize funds in USD, supporting the claim's incorrect assertion about the \"HEARLD KYJ TOUR CHAMPIONSHIP\".",
