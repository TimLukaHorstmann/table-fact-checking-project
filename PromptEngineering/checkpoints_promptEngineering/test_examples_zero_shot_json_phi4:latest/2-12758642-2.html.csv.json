Let's go through each step:\n\n1. **Locate the Event**: Look for the row where the column labeled \"Event\" contains the text \"pacrase - impressive tour 9\".\n\n2. **Verify Record**: Check if the value in the \"Record\" column for this event is \"19 - 9 - 4\".\n\n3. **Verify Time**: Ensure that the value in the \"Time\" column matches \"1:44\".\n\nNow, let's go through the data:\n\n- Search each row for \"Event\": \"pacrase - impressive tour 9\".\n- The first row (index 0) has this event listed.\n- Check the \"Record\" column in this row: it shows \"19 - 8 - 4\", not \"19 - 9 - 4\".\n- Therefore, the claim about the record is incorrect.\n\nSince the \"Record\" value does not match the claim, we can determine that the claim is false. However, let's also check the \"Time\" for completeness:\n\n- The \"Time\" column in this row shows \"1:44\", which matches the claimed time.\n  \nDespite the correct time, because the record value is incorrect, the overall claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify these conditions are from the first row (index 0) of the table, specifically for columns \"Event\", \"Record\", and \"Time\".\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
