This is found in the last row of the data section, which corresponds to `row_index` 27 (since indexing starts from 0).\n\n2. **Verify opponent details**: For September 28, check that the opponent listed is indeed the \"Red Sox\". In this row, we see that it matches.\n\n3. **Check the outcome and score**: The claim specifies a win against the Red Sox on September 28. We need to verify two aspects:\n   - The team won: This can be deduced if the column \"score\" indicates the other team (Red Sox) is listed second with fewer runs or the loss pitcher's record implies their team lost.\n   - The exact score was \"3 - 2\". In this row, \"score\" is indeed recorded as \"3 - 2\".\n\n4. **Determine the impact on the record**: After a win, we expect an increment in the winning column of the \"record\" field:\n   - Check the \"record\" column for September 28, which should reflect one additional win compared to the previous game.\n   - The entry shows \"76 - 86\", indicating 76 wins and 86 losses. This matches the expected result after adding a win (previously at \"75 - 86\").\n\nBased on these checks:\n\n- The match details for September 28 align with the claim: it was against the Red Sox, they won with a score of \"3 - 2\", and the record became \"76 - 86\".\n\nThus, all conditions in the claim are satisfied by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim, we need to verify if Mike Mussina was credited with the win for the September 25 game against the Orioles.\n\nThe relevant columns from the table are:\n- `date` to identify the specific game.\n- `opponent` to confirm that the game was against the Orioles.\n- `loss` to check which pitcher is recorded as having lost, thereby confirming who won if we have other context (since a win is implicitly stated by not being listed in the loss column and by winning record).\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify the September 25 game**:\n   - The table shows that row with index `24` corresponds to \"september 25\".\n\n2. **Verify opponent**:\n   - In row `24`, the opponent is listed as \"orioles\", which matches the claim.\n\n3. **Check for the pitcher's win or loss**:\n   - The `loss` column in row `24` shows \"mussina (15 - 8)\".\n   - This indicates that Mussina was the losing pitcher, not the winning one.\n\nSince the pitcher credited with the loss on September 25 against the Orioles is Mike Mussina, the claim that he got the win is false.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"loss\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
