Check if this person's bodyweight is \"104.70\".\n\nLet's go through the relevant columns in the data:\n\n- The \"snatch\" column contains the values for each participant.\n- The \"bodyweight\" column contains the weight values.\n\nNow, let's examine each row to find any instances of a snatch value of \"153.0\":\n\n1. **Row 5**: Christian L\u00f3pez has a snatch of \"153.0\" and a bodyweight of \"104.7\".\n2. No other rows have a snatch value of \"153.0\".\n\nSince there is only one person with a snatch of \"153.0\", we now verify the second condition:\n\n- The bodyweight for Christian L\u00f3pez (Row 5) is indeed \"104.7\", which matches the claim.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied: \n- There is exactly one person with a snatch of \"153.0\".\n- This person's bodyweight is \"104.70\".\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row 5, column \"snatch\" for the snatch value.\n- Row 5, column \"bodyweight\" for the bodyweight value.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"snatch\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bodyweight\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Therefore, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The `name` column in row 7 because it identifies \"jos\u00e9 espinoza (nca)\".\n- The `snatch` and `clean & jerk` columns in row 4 since these are the closest values to match those specified.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"snatch\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"clean & jerk\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
