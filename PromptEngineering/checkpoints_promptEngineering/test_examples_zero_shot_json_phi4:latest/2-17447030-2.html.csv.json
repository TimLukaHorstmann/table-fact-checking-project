For that match, the method should be \"submission (arm triangle choke)\" and the event should be \"ufc japan : ultimate japan\".\n\nLet's examine the relevant rows from the data:\n\n- **Row 2**: \n  - Opponent is \"dan severn\".\n  - Method is \"submission (arm triangle choke)\".\n  - Event is \"wef 9 - world class\", not \"ufc japan : ultimate japan\".\n\nGiven this information, let's verify each condition of the claim:\n- The opponent being \"dan severn\" is true for Row 2.\n- However, the method being \"submission (arm triangle choke)\" matches in Row 2.\n- The event must be \"ufc japan : ultimate japan\", but it is actually \"wef 9 - world class\".\n\nSince the event does not match \"ufc japan : ultimate japan\" when the opponent is \"dan severn\", the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify these conditions are in Row 2 and involve the columns: \"opponent\", \"method\", and \"event\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"only 1 fighter have a 5 - 3 record,\" we need to examine each entry in the table under the \"record\" column. We will check for any instances of the \"5 - 3\" record and count how many fighters have this specific record.\n\nLet's analyze the data:\n\n- Row 0: Record is \"6 - 4 (1)\"\n- Row 1: Record is \"5 - 4 (1)\"\n- Row 2: Record is \"5 - 3 (1)\" - This is our first occurrence of a \"5 - 3\" record.\n- Row 3: Record is \"5 - 2 (1)\"\n- Row 4: Record is \"4 - 2 (1)\"\n- Row 5: Record is \"3 - 2 (1)\"\n- Row 6: Record is \"3 - 1 (1)\"\n- Row 7: Record is \"3 - 1\"\n- Row 8: Record is \"3 - 0\"\n- Row 9: Record is \"2 - 0\"\n- Row 10: Record is \"1 - 0\"\n\nFrom this examination, we find that only one fighter has a record of \"5 - 3 (1)\" in row 2. No other entries match the \"5 - 3\" record.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because only one fighter has a \"5 - 3\" record.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
