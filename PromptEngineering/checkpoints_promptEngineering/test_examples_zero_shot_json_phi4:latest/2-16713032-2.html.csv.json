    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"Week 8 be the largest attendance for the Atlanta Falcon,\" we need to analyze the relevant data points within the provided table:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - The claim involves checking if a particular week (week 8) has the highest attendance recorded against the team mentioned (Atlanta Falcons).\n\n2. **Locate Week 8 Data:**\n   - From the given JSON, we find that in week 8:\n     - Date: October 29, 1989\n     - Opponent: Atlanta Falcons\n     - Result: W 20 - 13\n     - Attendance: 65,153\n\n3. **Compare Attendances for All Games against Atlanta Falcons:**\n   - The table shows another game against the Atlanta Falcons in week 11:\n     - Date: November 19, 1989\n     - Result: W 26 - 17\n     - Attendance: 53,173\n\n4. **Comparison Analysis:**\n   - Week 8 attendance (against Atlanta Falcons): 65,153\n   - Week 11 attendance (against Atlanta Falcons): 53,173\n   - Clearly, the week 8 game had a higher attendance than the week 11 game against the Atlanta Falcons.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since no other entries for games against the Atlanta Falcons exist in the table, and the week 8 entry has a greater attendance than the week 11 entry, the claim holds true.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - The cells relevant to verifying this claim are those containing the attendances from weeks 8 and 11.\n\nThus, based on the analysis above, the answer is \"TRUE,\" with the following relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
