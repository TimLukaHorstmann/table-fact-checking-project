The grand finalist is the Sydney Swans. However, there's no indication in the \"season result\" that they were a grand finalist (they are noted as \"premier\").\n- **1985**: Winner is Hawthorn, not Essendon.\n- **1986**: Winner is Hawthorn, not Essendon.\n\nFrom this analysis:\n\n- In 1981, Essendon was a winner with a margin greater than 10 against the grand finalist Carlton (24 points).\n- In 1984, although Essendon won with a margin of 51, they were noted as \"premier,\" indicating they were winners of the Grand Final and not just a finalist.\n\nThus, for any scenario where Essendon was both a winner and a grand finalist, their margin was indeed greater than 10. The claim holds true based on the available data.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"winners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"grand finalist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"margin\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"winners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"season result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding Collingwood's performance between 1977 and 1986 based on the provided table, we need to address two main components:\n\n1. **Determine if Collingwood was a Grand Finalist or Winner**: We must check if Collingwood appeared as either a winner or grand finalist in any of the years from 1977 to 1986.\n\n2. **Identify the Two Biggest Margins**: We need to find out which games had the largest winning margins and verify if Collingwood was involved in those games.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. **Collingwood's Grand Finalist or Winner Status**:\n   - The relevant column is \"grand finalist\".\n   - Check each row for entries where \"collingwood\" appears as a winner or grand finalist.\n\n2. **Largest Margins Identification**:\n   - The relevant column is \"margin\".\n   - Identify the two largest margin values and check which team was involved in those games.\n\n### Data Analysis:\n\n- From 1977 to 1986, let's examine the data for Collingwood as a winner or grand finalist:\n  - **1979**: Collingwood is listed as the winner.\n  - **1980**: Collingwood is the grand finalist.\n\nCollingwood was both a winner and a grand finalist in this period, satisfying the first part of the claim.\n\n- Next, identify games with the largest margins:\n  - **1978**: Fitzroy vs. North Melbourne (76 point margin)\n  - **1984**: Essendon vs. Sydney Swans (51 point margin)\n\nNeither of these matches involved Collingwood as a winner or grand finalist, which means they do not meet the claim condition.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that Collingwood was both the grand finalist or winner at games with the two biggest margins. While Collingwood did reach those statuses during this time, they were not involved in the games with the largest winning margins. Therefore, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n#### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n\n- For verifying Collingwood as a winner/grand finalist:\n  - Row index 3 (year 1979), column \"winners\"\n  - Row index 3 (year 1979), column \"grand finalist\"\n  - Row index 4 (year 1980), column \"grand finalist\"\n\n- For identifying the two largest margins:\n  - Row index 1 (year 1978), column \"margin\"\n  - Row index 7 (year 1984), column \"margin\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"grand finalist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"grand finalist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"margin\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"margin\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
