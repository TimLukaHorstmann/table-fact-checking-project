Whether Austin Daye scored 16 points in a game against Dallas.\n2. Whether his score of 16 was indeed the highest in that particular game.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Verify Austin Daye's Score\n- We look for games where Austin Daye scored 16 points and cross-reference it with the team name, which should be \"Dallas\" according to the claim.\n- In the provided data, we find:\n  - Row Index 4 has a game against Dallas (column \"team\") on October 13. The \"score\" is listed as \"Austin Daye (16)\" in the \"high points\" column.\n\n### Step 2: Verify if Austin Daye Scored Highest\n- In Row Index 4, we need to ensure that no other player scored more than 16 points.\n- Check the \"high points\" column for Row Index 4, which is \"Austin Daye (16).\" There are no indications of another player scoring higher.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied. Austin Daye did score 16 points in a game against Dallas, and he had the highest score in that game.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
