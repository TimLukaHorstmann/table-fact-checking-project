    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"the opponent be the yankee when the record be 4 - 5\" is true or false, we need to evaluate two conditions:\n\n1. The game where the team's record is \"4 - 5\".\n2. Whether the opponent in that game was the Yankees.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation\n\n**1. Identify Rows with Record \"4 - 5\":**\n\nWe'll look through the data for any row where the \"record\" column matches \"4 - 5\".\n\n- Row index **10** has a record of \"4 - 5\". \n\n**2. Check Opponent in Relevant Row:**\n\nIn row index 10, we need to check the \"opponent\" column to see if it is \"yankees\":\n\n- For row index **10**, the opponent listed is \"yankees\".\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe conditions are fully supported because:\n- The team's record of \"4 - 5\" corresponds to a game against the Yankees.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE. Now we will specify the relevant cells for verification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\nThis JSON object shows that both the conditions of the claim were verified in row index 10.",

Find a row where the \"record\" is \"4 - 5\".\n2. Verify if, for that row, the \"opponent\" is \"yankees\" and the \"date\" is \"april 11\".\n\nLet's go through the relevant steps:\n\n- **Condition 1**: Locate the record \"4 - 5\". Upon examining each row:\n  - The row with index 12 has a \"record\" value of \"4 - 5\".\n  \n- **Condition 2**: Check if, in this row (index 12), the opponent is \"yankees\" and the date is \"april 11\":\n  - For row 12: \n    - \"opponent\": \"yankees\"\n    - \"date\": \"april 11\"\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied by row index 12.
