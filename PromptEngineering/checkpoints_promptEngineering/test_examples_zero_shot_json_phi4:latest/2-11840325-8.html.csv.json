    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify several conditions against the table provided in the JSON format:\n\n1. **Year Condition**: The event must have occurred in 2012.\n2. **Winner and Loser Condition**: Oakland Raiders should be the loser and Kansas City Chiefs should be the winner.\n3. **Location Condition**: The match must have taken place at Arrowhead Stadium.\n4. **Result Condition**: The score must be 15 - 0.\n\nWe'll evaluate these conditions step-by-step using the data in the table:\n\n- We look for entries in the year 2012:\n  - There are two matches listed for 2012:\n    - Row index 5: [\"oakland raiders\", \"26 - 16\", \"kansas city chiefs\"] at Arrowhead Stadium.\n    - Row index 6: [\"oakland raiders\", \"15 - 0\", \"kansas city chiefs\"] at OCO Coliseum.\n\n- Check each condition for these entries:\n  - **Row Index 5**:\n    - Year is 2012 (satisfies the year condition).\n    - Winner is Oakland Raiders and Loser is Kansas City Chiefs, which does not match the claim where Chiefs should be winners.\n    - Location is Arrowhead Stadium (matches location condition).\n    - Result is 26 - 16 (does not satisfy result condition).\n\n  - **Row Index 6**:\n    - Year is 2012 (satisfies the year condition).\n    - Winner is Oakland Raiders and Loser is Kansas City Chiefs, which does not match the claim.\n    - Location is OCO Coliseum (does not match location condition).\n    - Result is 15 - 0 (matches result condition).\n\nNone of the rows from 2012 satisfy all conditions of the claim simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells that verify this are those in row index 6 for the columns \"year\", \"winner\", \"loser\", \"location\", and \"result\".\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"loser\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
