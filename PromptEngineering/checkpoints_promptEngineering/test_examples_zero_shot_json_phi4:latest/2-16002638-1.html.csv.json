    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to check if the number of wins in each season from 2003 to 2009 is different. The relevant column for this verification is \"wins.\"\n\nLet's examine the data:\n\n1. **2003**: Wins = 6\n2. **2004**: Wins = 6\n3. **2005**: Wins = 5\n4. **2006**: Wins = 3\n5. **2007**: Wins = 9\n6. **2008**: Wins = 5\n7. **2009**: Wins = 2\n\nThe claim states that the Dundee Hurricane do not win the same number of games in any of the seasons between 2003 and 2009.\n\n- In 2003, they won 6 games.\n- In 2004, they also won 6 games.\n\nSince there are two seasons (2003 and 2004) with the same number of wins (6), the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells:\n\n- **Row Index 0**: Wins = 6\n- **Row Index 1**: Wins = 6\n\nThese rows show repeated win counts, which directly contradicts the claim. Therefore, these are the relevant cells.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
