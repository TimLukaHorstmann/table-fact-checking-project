We will look for entries with this class name.\n\n2. **Railway number(s)**: The claim states \"16 - 19\", but from our search, we see that \"i b\" has railway numbers \"7 - 15\".\n\n3. **Quantity larger than 8**: For the \"i b\" class, check if the quantity is greater than 8.\n\n4. **Type c n2**: Check if the type for the \"i b\" class is \"c n2\".\n\nLet's examine the relevant row in the table:\n\n- The entry with class \"i b\" has:\n  - Railway numbers: \"7 - 15\"\n  - Quantity: 9\n  - Type: \"1a1 n2\"\n\nNow, let's verify each condition from the claim against this data:\n\n- **Class (old) to 1868**: Matches as \"i b\".\n- **Railway number(s)**: The claim states \"16 - 19\", but the actual railway numbers are \"7 - 15\".
