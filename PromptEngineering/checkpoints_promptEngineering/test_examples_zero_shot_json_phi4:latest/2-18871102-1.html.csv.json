    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"the berries be mascot for logansport community school in kokomo,\" we need to check two parts of the information provided:\n\n1. **Mascot Check**: We need to verify if \"berries\" is indeed the mascot for \"logansport community school.\"\n2. **Location Check**: We also need to ensure that \"logansport community school\" is located in \"kokomo.\"\n\nLet's break down these checks using the relevant columns from the table:\n\n### Step 1: Mascot Verification\n- The relevant column here is \"mascot.\"\n- Find the row where the \"school\" is \"logansport community.\"\n- Check the value under the \"mascot\" column for that row.\n\n### Step 2: Location Verification\n- The relevant column here is \"location.\"\n- Again, find the row where the \"school\" is \"logansport community.\"\n- Check the value under the \"location\" column for that row to see if it matches \"kokomo.\"\n\n### Data Extraction from Table:\nFrom the table:\n\n1. For \"logansport community school\":\n   - **Row Index**: 3\n   - **Mascot**: \"berries\"\n   - **Location**: \"logansport\"\n\n### Verification:\n- The mascot for \"logansport community school\" is indeed \"berries,\" which matches part of the claim.\n- However, the location for \"logansport community school\" is \"logansport,\" not \"kokomo.\" This contradicts the second part of the claim.\n\nSince both parts of the claim must be true for the entire claim to be valid, and one part (location) does not match, the overall claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 3, Column \"mascot\" verifies that the mascot is indeed \"berries.\"\n- Row 3, Column \"location\" shows the location as \"logansport,\" which does not match \"kokomo.\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
