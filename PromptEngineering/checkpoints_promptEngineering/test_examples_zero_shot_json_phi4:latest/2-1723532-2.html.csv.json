The claim states: \"the date for the tournament in indian wells be 8 march 1992.\"\n\nHere's how we can approach verifying this:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: \n   - We are interested in columns related to the tournament location and date because these directly relate to the claim.\n   - Specifically, the relevant columns from the table are:\n     - \"tournament\"\n     - \"date\"\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Row**:\n   - The claim mentions \"indian wells,\" which corresponds to a specific tournament entry in the table.\n   - We need to find rows where the \"tournament\" column matches \"indian wells.\"\n\n3. **Verify Date**:\n   - Once we locate the row(s) with the tournament name \"indian wells,\" we check if the corresponding \"date\" is \"8 march 1992.\"\n   \n4. **Check Each Condition in the Claim**:\n   - The claim specifies both a location (\"indian wells\") and a date (\"8 march 1992\"). Both conditions need to be satisfied for the claim to be true.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n- Looking through the data entries, we find one entry with \"tournament\" as \"indian wells\":\n  - Row index: 13\n  - Columns:\n    - \"date\": \"8 march 1992\"\n    - \"tournament\": \"indian wells\"\n\nThis row matches both parts of the claim perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.

It matches.\n\n- **Check the opponent**:\n  - In the same row, check the \"opponent\": it is listed as \"j\u00e9r\u00f4me potier\", which matches exactly with the claim.\n\nAll conditions of the claim are satisfied by this entry.
