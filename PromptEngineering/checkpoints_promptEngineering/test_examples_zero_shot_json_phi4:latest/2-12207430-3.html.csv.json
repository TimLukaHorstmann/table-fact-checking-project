    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate its components against the data provided in the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"the kansas city royal victory over the toronto blue jay on may 12th drop the blue jays' record to 18 - 12.\"\n\nLet's break down the relevant aspects of this claim:\n\n1. **Date Verification**: The claim refers to a game on May 12th.\n\n2. **Teams Involved**:\n   - Kansas City Royals\n   - Toronto Blue Jays\n\n3. **Outcome**: A \"victory\" for the Kansas City Royals.\n   \n4. **Resulting Record for the Opponent (Toronto Blue Jays)**: The claim mentions that this game resulted in the Toronto Blue Jays' record being 18 - 12.\n\nNow, let's locate and verify each part of the claim using the table:\n\n- **Row Index**: \n  - On May 12th, we find an entry at row index 11:\n    ```json\n    [\n      \"may 12\",\n      \"royals\",\n      \"3 - 1\",\n      \"cerutti (1 - 1)\",\n      \"30034\",\n      \"18 - 12\"\n    ]\n    ```\n\n- **Teams Involved**:\n  - The entry shows the opponent as \"royals\" and not \"blue jays\". Thus, it's a game between the Royals and another team.\n  \n- **Outcome**: \n  - The score is listed as \"3 - 1\", which indicates a win for the Royals.\n\n- **Record Change**:\n  - The record shown here (\"18 - 12\") matches what the claim says would be the Blue Jays' record after this game, assuming they were the opposing team. However, we need to confirm that the Toronto Blue Jays are indeed involved in this game.\n  \n- **Verification of Teams**: \n  - There is no mention of the \"blue jays\" as an opponent in row index 11 or anywhere else in the data provided for May 12th.\n\nGiven these points:\n- The claim assumes a matchup between Kansas City Royals and Toronto Blue Jays on May 12th. However, there is no evidence in the table that this specific matchup occurred.\n  \nThus, based on the available data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to evaluate each component based on the data provided in the table:\n\n1. **Team Identification**: The claim mentions \"the Kansas City Royal\" (likely referring to the Royals) beating a team called \"the Blue Jays.\" However, there is no mention of any games against \"the Blue Jays\" in the dataset.\n\n2. **Opponent Verification**: We need to check if there are any records where the opponent was the \"Blue Jays.\" The table includes opponents like \"Rangers,\" \"Royals,\" \"Twins,\" \"Athletics,\" \"Angels,\" and \"Mariners.\" There is no entry for a game against \"the Blue Jays.\"\n\n3. **Date Requirement**: The claim specifies that this event occurred after May 12th. This is important to verify the timing aspect, but since there are no games listed against the Blue Jays at all in the dataset, it becomes irrelevant.\n\n4. **Record Verification**: The claim states that after defeating the Blue Jays, the record was \"18 - 12.\" We need to check if this record appears for the Royals after May 12th:\n   - On May 11 (row 10), the record is 18 - 11.\n   - On May 12 (row 11), the record becomes 18 - 12.\n\n   However, there are no entries beyond May 31st to check if this was updated further, but since there's no game against the Blue Jays, the update of the record isn't relevant for this claim.\n\nGiven these evaluations:\n- There is no game recorded in the dataset where the Royals beat the Blue Jays.\n- The requirement that it happened after May 12th cannot be satisfied because such a game does not exist in the data.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE. Since there are no relevant cells to support the claim (as no such event occurred), we only need to return the answer key with \"FALSE.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
