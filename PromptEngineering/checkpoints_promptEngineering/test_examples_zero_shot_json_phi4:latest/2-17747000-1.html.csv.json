    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the results of the matches in both the 1st and 2nd rounds. Specifically, we must identify which teams failed to score a single point across both rounds.\n\nThe table provides the scores for each round as well as the aggregate score (which is crucial since it reflects who advanced). We are interested in identifying teams that did not win any matches or at least draw one match in either round to secure a point. \n\nHere's how we approach this:\n\n1. **Understand the scoring system**:\n   - A team gets 3 points for a win.\n   - A team gets 1 point for a draw.\n   - A team gets 0 points for a loss.\n\n2. **Check each match**:\n   - For teams that were eliminated, we need to check if they scored in either the first or second round to determine if they got any points.\n\n3. **Analyze each row of data**:\n\n   - **Row 0**: \n     - Toulouse FC vs OGC Nice: 1-1 (1st), 1-1 (2nd)\n     - Both teams scored in both rounds, so neither failed to score a point.\n\n   - **Row 1**:\n     - Lille OSC vs AJ Auxerre: 1-0 (1st), 1-2 (2nd)\n     - Lille won the first round but lost the second. They scored points.\n     - AJ Auxerre didn't win any round and failed to score in the first round, but they did score in the second. So, they got a point.\n\n   - **Row 2**:\n     - Montpellier HSC vs FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard: 2-2 (1st), 0-1 (2nd)\n     - Both teams scored points as Montpellier drew the first round and Sochaux drew in both rounds.\n\n   - **Row 3**:\n     - Stade de Reims vs Le Havre AC: 2-0 (1st), 0-1 (2nd)\n     - Stade de Reims won the first round, so they got points.\n     - Le Havre lost without scoring in the first round but scored in the second. They earned a point.\n\n   - **Row 4**:\n     - FC Metz vs FC Mulhouse: 1-0 (1st), 2-0 (2nd)\n     - FC Metz won both rounds, so they got points.\n     - FC Mulhouse didn't score in any round and thus did not earn any points.\n\n   - **Row 5**:\n     - FC S\u00e8te vs RC Lens: 0-0 (1st), 0-1 (2nd)\n     - Both teams scored a point from the first draw, but FC S\u00e8te failed to score in the second round. They got one point from the draw.\n\n   - **Row 6**:\n     - AEP Bourg-sous-la-Roche vs Stade Quimperois: 1-3 (1st), 2-2 (2nd)\n     - AEP Bourg scored points in both rounds, so they got at least one point.\n     - Stade Quimperois won the first round and drew the second. They earned points.\n\n   - **Row 7**:\n     - SO Ch\u00e2tellerault vs US Cr\u00e9teil: 0-0 (1st), 0-0 (2nd)\n     - Both teams scored a point from each draw, so they didn't fail to score any points.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis above, only FC Mulhouse failed to score any points over both rounds. All other eliminated teams managed to secure at least one point in either round.\n\nThe claim states that \"only 2 teams fail to score a single point in the round of 16 match.\" However, we identified only one team (FC Mulhouse) that did not score any points across both matches.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2nd round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2nd round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
