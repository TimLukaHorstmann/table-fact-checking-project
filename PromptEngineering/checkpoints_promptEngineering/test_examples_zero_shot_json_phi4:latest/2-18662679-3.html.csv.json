    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the average time being approximately 6.2 minutes is true or false, we need to calculate the average of the times provided in the table and compare it with 6.2 minutes.\n\n1. **Extract Relevant Data**: We focus on the \"time\" column since it contains the data necessary for calculating the average time.\n   \n2. **Convert Times**: The times are given in a format that includes minutes and seconds (e.g., `5:36.20`). To calculate an accurate average, we need to convert these times entirely into seconds.\n\n3. **Calculation**:\n   - Convert each time from minutes:seconds to total seconds.\n     - 1st row: \"5:36.20\" \u2192 \\(5 \\times 60 + 36.2 = 336.2\\) seconds\n     - 2nd row: \"5:36.42\" \u2192 \\(5 \\times 60 + 36.4 = 336.4\\) seconds\n     - 3rd row: \"5:39.18\" \u2192 \\(5 \\times 60 + 39.18 = 339.18\\) seconds\n     - 4th row: \"5:42.22\" \u2192 \\(5 \\times 60 + 42.22 = 342.22\\) seconds\n     - 5th row: \"6:00.98\" \u2192 \\(6 \\times 60 + 0.98 = 360.98\\) seconds\n\n4. **Calculate the Average in Seconds**:\n   - Sum of times in seconds: \\(336.2 + 336.4 + 339.18 + 342.22 + 360.98 = 1715.98\\)\n   - Number of entries: 5\n   - Average time in seconds: \\(\\frac{1715.98}{5} = 343.196\\) seconds\n\n5. **Convert the Average Back to Minutes**:\n   - Convert \\(343.196\\) seconds back to minutes and seconds:\n     - Minutes: \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{343.196}{60} \\right\\rfloor = 5\\) minutes\n     - Seconds: \\(343.196 - (5 \\times 60) = 43.196\\) seconds\n   - Average time in minutes: \\(5 + \\frac{43.196}{60} \\approx 5.71993\\) minutes\n\n6. **Comparison with Claim**:\n   - The calculated average time is approximately 5.72 minutes.\n   - The claim states the average should be about 6.2 minutes.\n\nSince 5.72 minutes is significantly different from 6.2 minutes, the claim is false.\n\n7. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells for this calculation are all rows in the \"time\" column because each time value contributes to the average calculation.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
