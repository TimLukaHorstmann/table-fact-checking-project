We need to find the row where the \"district\" column is \"santa mesa\".\n3. **Check Population Value**: Once we locate the correct row, we should check the value in the \"population (2010 census)\" column.\n4. **Verify Against Claim**: Compare this population number with 99,993 as stated in the claim.\n\nFollowing these steps:\n\n- The district \"Santa Mesa\" is located at `row_index` 14 (considering zero-based indexing).\n- In this row, under the \"population (2010 census)\" column, the value listed is 99,933.\n- Compare 99,933 with the claimed population of 99,993.\n\nSince 99,933 does not equal 99,993, the claim is false. \n\nThe relevant cell for verification is:\n- `row_index`: 14\n- `column_name`: \"population (2010 census)\"\n\nTherefore, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"population (2010 census)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify each part of the claim against the data in the table:\n\n1. **District Name**: The claim mentions \"santa cruz district.\" We must find this district in the table.\n2. **Number of Barangays**: It states that there should be 51 barangays in santa cruz district.\n3. **Population (2010 Census)**: Finally, it claims a population of 99,933 for santa cruz.\n\nLet's examine these conditions:\n\n- First, locate \"santa cruz\" in the table:\n  - By examining each row under the \"district\" column, we find that \"santa cruz\" is at row index 14 (if counting from 0).\n\n- Check the number of barangays for \"santa cruz\":\n  - In row index 14, under the \"s barangay\" column, there are indeed 82 barangays, not 51.\n\n- Since the first condition regarding the number of barangays is false, we do not need to check further. The claim about population being 99,933 for santa cruz district with 51 barangays is false because the actual number of barangays in santa cruz district does not match what is stated in the claim.\n\nThus, the relevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row index 14, column \"district\" to identify the district.\n- Row index 14, column \"s barangay\" to check the number of barangays.\n- (Although unnecessary since the first condition fails) row index 14, column \"population (2010 census)\" for completeness.\n\nNow we can construct our JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"district\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"s barangay\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
