    "resp": "To verify the claim \"draft pick number 155 come from arizona university,\" we need to identify and examine specific pieces of information from the given table. The relevant data points in this case are associated with a draft pick's number and its corresponding college.\n\n1. **Identify the row where the pick number is 155**: \n   - We look at the \"pick\" column for the value 155.\n   - In the provided data, we find that the entry with pick number 155 is in the sixth row (keeping in mind that indexing starts from zero).\n\n2. **Verify the college associated with pick number 155**:\n   - For the identified row (sixth), we need to check the \"college\" column to see if it states \"arizona.\"\n   - The data shows that for pick number 155, the player's college is indeed \"arizona.\"\n\n3. **Check the phrasing of the claim**:\n   - The claim mentions \"arizona university.\" While the table simply lists \"arizona,\" this generally refers to Arizona State University or the University of Arizona.\n   - Since there is no additional context provided that specifies which institution, and given standard naming conventions, it's reasonable to interpret \"arizona\" as referring to a college in Arizona, such as the University of Arizona.\n\nBased on these observations, the claim is supported by the data. Therefore, the answer is \"TRUE.\"\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n- Row index 5 (sixth row) and column \"pick\" for verifying the pick number.\n- Row index 5 (sixth row) and column \"college\" to check the associated college.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to identify which college has the last draft pick in the given table and verify if it is Arizona.\n\n1. **Identify the Last Draft Pick:**\n   - The last draft pick in the table can be identified by looking at the highest round number and pick number combination.\n   - In this case, row 11 with `round` 11 and `pick` 293 represents the last draft pick.\n\n2. **Verify the College for the Last Draft Pick:**\n   - For row 11, check the \"college\" column to see which college corresponds to the player drafted in that position.\n   - The college listed is \"northwestern state, la.\"\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since \"northwestern state, la.\" is the college for the last draft pick and not Arizona, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row 11, Column \"round\" (to find it's the last round)\n- Row 11, Column \"pick\" (to confirm it's the highest pick number)\n- Row 11, Column \"college\" (to identify which college corresponds to this draft pick)\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
