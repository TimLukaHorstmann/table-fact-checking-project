Verify that this score places him at \"t8\".\n\nLet's examine each relevant piece of information from the table.\n\n### Step 1: Locate Fred Funk in the Table\n\nFrom the data:\n- Fred Funk is listed with a score of \"69 + 69 = 138\" and a place of \"t8\".\n\n### Step 2: Verify Fred Funk's Score\n- The row where Fred Funk appears shows his score as \"69 + 69 = 138\".\n- This confirms that his total score is indeed 138.\n\n### Step 3: Verify Fred Funk's Place\n- In the same row, Fred Funk is listed with a place of \"t8\".\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied according to the data:\n\n1. Fred Funk's score is 138.\n2.
