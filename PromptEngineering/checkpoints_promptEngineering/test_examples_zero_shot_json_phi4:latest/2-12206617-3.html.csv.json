The team \"Toronto Blue Jays\" should appear as either a home or away team.\n2. They should have played against the \"Rangers.\"\n3. These games should occur in the month of May.\n4. There should be exactly 3 such games.\n\n### Table Analysis\n\n#### Step 1: Check for \"Toronto Blue Jays\"\nThe table does not explicitly list any team as \"Toronto Blue Jays.\" Instead, it lists opponents by their city names like \"Rangers\" and \"Royals.\" We need to verify if \"Rangers\" refers to the Texas Rangers (common MLB team), as no mention of \"Blue Jays\" is present.\n\n#### Step 2: Check for \"Rangers\"\nWe look at the column labeled \"opponent\" in the table to find occurrences of \"Rangers.\"\n\n- On May 1, the opponent is \"Rangers.\"\n- On May 7, the opponent is again \"Rangers.\"\n- On May 8, the opponent remains \"Rangers.\"\n\nThese entries confirm that the team played against the Rangers three times.\n\n#### Step 3: Check for Month of May\nAll these games (May 1, May 7, and May 8) occurred in May, which aligns with part of the claim.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFrom the table:\n- The \"Rangers\" appear as opponents on May 1, May 7, and May 8.\n- There are no mentions or implications of \"Toronto Blue Jays\" being involved. The term \"Blue Jays\" does not appear anywhere in the provided data.\n- Since there is no reference to the Toronto Blue Jays, we cannot confirm that they played against the Rangers.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is **FALSE** because the table does not mention the Toronto Blue Jays playing any games, despite showing three games against the Rangers.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are those where \"Rangers\" appear as an opponent in May:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
