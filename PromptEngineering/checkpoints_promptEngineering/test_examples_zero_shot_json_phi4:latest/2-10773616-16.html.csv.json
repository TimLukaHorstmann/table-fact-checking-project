    "resp": "To evaluate the claim that \"kardinia park be 1 of 3 venue where the home team score be higher than the away team score,\" we need to examine each row in the data and check two conditions:\n\n1. The match took place at Kardinia Park.\n2. The home team's score is higher than the away team's score.\n\nLet's go through each entry of the table:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Venue: \"kardinia park\"\n  - Home Team Score: \"13.12 (90)\"\n  - Away Team Score: \"7.6 (48)\"\n  \n  The home team score is higher than the away team score at Kardinia Park. This supports part of the claim.\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Venue: \"victoria park\"\n  - Home Team Score: \"12.16 (88)\"\n  - Away Team Score: \"13.12 (90)\"\n\n  The home team score is not higher than the away team score, and it's not at Kardinia Park.\n\n- **Row 2**: \n  - Venue: \"princes park\"\n  - Home Team Score: \"10.16 (76)\"\n  - Away Team Score: \"11.14 (80)\"\n\n  The home team score is not higher than the away team score, and it's not at Kardinia Park.\n\n- **Row 3**: \n  - Venue: \"punt road oval\"\n  - Home Team Score: \"10.18 (78)\"\n  - Away Team Score: \"15.4 (94)\"\n\n  The home team score is not higher than the away team score, and it's not at Kardinia Park.\n\n- **Row 4**: \n  - Venue: \"arden street oval\"\n  - Home Team Score: \"9.14 (68)\"\n  - Away Team Score: \"9.14 (68)\"\n\n  The home team score is equal to the away team score, and it's not at Kardinia Park.\n\n- **Row 5**: \n  - Venue: \"junction oval\"\n  - Home Team Score: \"13.14 (92)\"\n  - Away Team Score: \"9.15 (69)\"\n\n  The home team score is higher than the away team score, but it's not at Kardinia Park.\n\nFrom this analysis, only Row 0 satisfies both conditions relevant to the claim for Kardinia Park. Now we need to check if there are two more venues where the home team score is higher than the away team score:\n\n- **Row 5**: \n  - Venue: \"junction oval\"\n  - The home team's score is indeed higher than the away team\u2019s score.\n\nWe still need one more such venue. Let's verify all rows again for any other matches where the home team scored higher:\n\n- **Row 2** and **Row 4** are tied games, so they don't satisfy the condition.\n- Only Row 0 and Row 5 have home teams with scores higher than the away teams.\n\nSince we only found two venues (Kardinia Park and Junction Oval) where the home team scored higher than the away team, not three as claimed, the statement is false.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
