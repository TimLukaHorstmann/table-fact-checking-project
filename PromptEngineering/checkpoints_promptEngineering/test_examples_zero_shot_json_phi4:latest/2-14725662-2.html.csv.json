Confirm that the site for this game is \"memorial stadium minneapolis, mn.\"\n\nLet's analyze the relevant part of the data:\n\n- The table lists games with their respective opponents and sites.\n- We need to find the entry where the opponent is \"iowa\" and check the corresponding site.\n\nReviewing the data in the table:\n\n1. The row at index 4 (zero-based indexing) has:\n   - Opponent: \"iowa\"\n   - Site: \"memorial stadium minneapolis, mn\"\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are satisfied by this entry, the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Row index 4, column \"opponent\" to confirm the opponent is \"iowa.\"\n- Row index 4, column \"site\" to verify the site is \"memorial stadium minneapolis, mn.\"\n\nHere's the JSON response with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
