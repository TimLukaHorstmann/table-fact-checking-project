    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we must identify the row in the table where the description indicates the item is \"undergoing overhaul, restoration or repairs\" and check its corresponding date.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - We search for a row with the description \"undergoing overhaul, restoration or repairs.\" In this table, it is found at:\n     ```json\n     [\n       \"undergoing overhaul , restoration or repairs\",\n       \"undergoing overhaul , restoration or repairs\",\n       \"undergoing overhaul , restoration or repairs\",\n       \"undergoing overhaul , restoration or repairs\",\n       \"undergoing overhaul , restoration or repairs\"\n     ]\n     ```\n   - This corresponds to the row index 7.\n\n2. **Check Date in Relevant Row:**\n   - The date for this row is also \"undergoing overhaul, restoration or repairs,\" indicating no specific year provided.\n\n3. **Compare with Claimed Year (1956):**\n   - The claim states that the date for the item undergoing overhaul, restoration, or repair should be 1956.\n   - Since there is no specific date given in this row, it does not match \"1956.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - As there is no year specified in the relevant row for an item undergoing overhaul, restoration, or repairs, and since that information doesn't support the claim of being 1956, the claim is false.\n\nThe JSON response would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"description\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
