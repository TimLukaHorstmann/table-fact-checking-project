    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the first of these colleges to be founded was Southwestern Assemblies of God University in 1927\" is true or false, we need to verify the founding years of all institutions listed in the table and identify which one was established first.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The column relevant to this claim is \"founded,\" as it contains the founding year for each institution.\n2. **Extract Founding Years**:\n   - Bacone College: 1880\n   - Langston University: 1897\n   - Oklahoma Baptist University: 1910\n   - Oklahoma Panhandle State University: 1909\n   - Southwestern Assemblies of God University: 1927\n   - Texas College: 1894\n\n3. **Determine the Earliest Founding Year**: By comparing all the founding years, we find that Bacone College, founded in 1880, is the earliest.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The claim states Southwestern Assemblies of God University was the first to be founded in 1927, which contradicts our finding that Bacone College (founded in 1880) predates it by several decades.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Each institution's founding year must be checked, so all rows under the \"founded\" column are relevant for verification.\n  \n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify whether Oklahoma Panhandle State University has the smallest enrollment among the listed colleges.\n\n1. **Identify Enrollment Values**: We will extract the enrollment values from the \"enrollment\" column for each institution in the table.\n   - Bacone College: 900\n   - Langston University: 3922\n   - Oklahoma Baptist University: 1871\n   - Oklahoma Panhandle State University: 1550\n   - Southwestern Assemblies of God University: 2013\n   - Texas College: 600\n\n2. **Compare Enrollment Values**: We need to find the smallest enrollment number from the list:\n   - The enrollments are: 900, 3922, 1871, 1550, 2013, and 600.\n   - Among these, the smallest value is 600 for Texas College.\n\n3. **Verify Claim Against Table**: The claim states that Oklahoma Panhandle State University has the smallest enrollment with a number of 1550. However, we identified that Texas College actually has the smallest enrollment at 600.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since Texas College has a smaller enrollment than Oklahoma Panhandle State University, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - Enrollment values for all colleges are relevant to check which one has the smallest enrollment.\n   - Row indices and column name \"enrollment\" for each college will be included in the relevant cells list.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
