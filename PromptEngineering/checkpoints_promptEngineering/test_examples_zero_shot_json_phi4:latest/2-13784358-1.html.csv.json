    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"the year 1989 with symphony tower holds the rank of 2,\" we need to verify two conditions using the provided table data:\n\n1. The building named \"Symphony Towers\" should be associated with the year 1989.\n2. This building should hold the rank of 2.\n\nWe will identify which cells in the JSON table are relevant for checking these conditions and then determine if both conditions are satisfied.\n\n**Step-by-step Verification:**\n\n- **Row Identification**: First, we need to locate \"Symphony Towers\" in the data to find its row index. By examining the rows, we see that \"Symphony Towers\" is listed in the second row of the data (considering zero-based indexing).\n\n- **Relevant Columns for Verification**:\n  - For verifying the building name \"Symphony Towers,\" we refer to the column named \"name.\"\n  - To verify the year associated with this building, we check the column named \"year.\"\n  - Finally, we need to confirm that the rank of this building is indeed 2. This requires checking the column named \"rank.\"\n\n- **Checking Values**:\n  - In row index 1 (\"Symphony Towers\"):\n    - The value in the \"name\" column should be \"symphony towers.\" It matches.\n    - The value in the \"year\" column should be 1989. It matches.\n    - The value in the \"rank\" column should be 2. It matches.\n\nSince all conditions are satisfied, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Row index 1 and column \"name\": Checks if the building is named \"Symphony Towers.\"\n- Row index 1 and column \"year\": Confirms the year as 1989.\n- Row index 1 and column \"rank\": Verifies that the rank is 2.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
