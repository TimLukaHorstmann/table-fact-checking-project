We must locate this date within the table.\n\n2. **Check for the opponent on that date**: Once we find the row corresponding to September 26, we should examine the \"opponent\" column in that row to verify if it matches \"Denver Broncos.\"\n\nLet's go through these steps using the data provided:\n\n- The first column is labeled \"week,\" followed by columns: \"date,\" \"opponent,\" \"final score,\" \"team record,\" \"game site,\" and \"attendance.\"\n  \n- In the second row (row index 1), we find:\n  - \"date\": September 26\n  - \"opponent\": Denver Broncos\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are satisfied in this row, the opponent on September 26 is indeed \"Denver Broncos.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the information in the table:\n\n- **Answer**: TRUE\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are those that contain the date and opponent in the second row (row index 1):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
