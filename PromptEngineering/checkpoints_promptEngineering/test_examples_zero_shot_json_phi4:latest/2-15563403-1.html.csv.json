    "resp": "To verify the claim that \"William E. Barron will run for the representative - at - large office under the law preservation ticket,\" we need to check two conditions in the table:\n\n1. Identify if there is a row labeled as \"us representative - at - large.\"\n2. Within this row, confirm whether \"William E. Barron\" is listed under the \"law preservation ticket\" column.\n\nLet's examine these steps using the provided JSON data:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: \n   - We need to locate rows that pertain to the \"us representative - at - large\" office.\n   - From the table, there are two such rows:\n     - Row index 8: [\"us representative - at - large\", \"matthew j merritt\", \"william b groat , jr\", \"charles w noonan\", \"(none)\", \"william e barron\"]\n     - Row index 9: [\"us representative - at - large\", \"caroline o'day\", \"natalie f couch\", \"august claessens\", \"(none)\", \"dorothy frooks\"]\n\n2. **Check the Law Preservation Ticket Column**:\n   - For Row 8 (index 8), under the \"law preservation ticket\" column, we find \"william e barron.\"\n   - This matches the condition specified in the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in row index 8 for the \"us representative - at - large\" office.
