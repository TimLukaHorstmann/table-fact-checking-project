The relevant column for this task is \"episode title.\"\n\nHere's how we can verify the claim:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Cells:**  \n   We are interested only in the \"episode title\" column across all rows.\n\n2. **Check Each Episode Title:**  \n   For each row, we will inspect the value under the \"episode title\" column to ensure it contains at least one letter (a-z or A-Z).\n\n3. **Verification Process:**\n   - Row 0: \"tia & tamera mowry / ll cool j\" - Contains letters.\n   - Row 1: \"montell jordan\" - Contains letters.\n   - Row 2: \"dru hill\" - Contains letters.\n   - Row 3: \"tyra banks / blackstreet\" - Contains letters.\n   - Row 4: \"music special\" - Contains letters.\n   - Row 5: \"a tribe called quest\" - Contains letters.\n   - Row 6: \"702\" - Contains no letters (only numbers).\n   - Row 7: \"tony! toni! tone!\" - Contains letters.\n   - Row 8: \"chris farley / mint condition\" - Contains letters.\n   - Row 9: \"112\" - Contains no letters (only numbers).\n   - Row 10: \"sherman hemsley / nas\" - Contains letters.\n   - Row 11: \"john leguizamo / mona lisa\" - Contains letters.\n   - Row 12: \"ray j\" - Contains letters.\n   - Row 13: \"for real\" - Contains letters.\n   - Row 14: \"aaliyah\" - Contains letters.\n   - Row 15: \"az yet\" - Contains letters.\n   - Row 16: \"monica\" - Contains letters.\n   - Row 17: \"mc lyte\" - Contains letters.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**  \n   The claim is false because rows 6 and 9 (\"702\" and \"112\") do not contain any letters in their episode titles.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells for the Claim:**\n   We need to list all cells under the \"episode title\" column since they were checked against the claim.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
