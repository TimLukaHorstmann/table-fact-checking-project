    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim regarding the table data provided in JSON format, we need to verify two specific conditions:\n\n1. The lead should be \"zang jialiang\" during the 2008 WMCC.\n2. An alternate named \"li dongyan\" should also be part of that same event.\n\nLet's break down the verification process by examining each condition against the table data:\n\n### Condition 1: Lead Verification\n- **Claimed Lead:** zang jialiang\n- We need to find a row in the table where:\n  - The \"season\" corresponds to the timeframe or event of the 2008 WMCC.\n  - The value in the \"lead\" column is \"zang jialiang\".\n\n**Table Search:**\n- Row 3 has \"season\": \"2007 - 08\", \"events\": \"2008 wmcc\", and \"lead\": \"zang jialiang\".\n- This row matches the criteria for both season/event and lead.\n\n### Condition 2: Alternate Verification\n- **Claimed Alternate:** li dongyan\n- We need to find a row where:\n  - The \"season\" corresponds to the timeframe or event of the 2008 WMCC.\n  - The value in the \"alternate\" column is \"li dongyan\".\n\n**Table Search:**\n- Row 3 has \"season\": \"2007 - 08\", \"events\": \"2008 wmcc\", and \"alternate\": \"li dongyan\".\n- This row matches the criteria for both season/event and alternate.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied by row index 3 in the table. Thus, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"events\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"lead\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"alternate\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
