Whether this occurs on game 6.\n\nLet's break down these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Series Scores\n\nThe relevant column for checking the series score is \"series\". We will extract and examine the series scores from each row in the data:\n\n- **Game 1**: Series = \"1 - 0\"\n- **Game 2**: Series = \"1 - 1\"\n- **Game 3**: Series = \"2 - 1\"\n- **Game 4**: Series = \"2 - 2\"\n- **Game 5**: Series = \"2 - 3\"\n- **Game 6**: Series = \"2 - 4\"\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Highest Series Score\n\nTo identify the highest series score, we need to consider both numbers in each series format (\"x - y\"), where a higher first number indicates an advantage for the team being discussed. \n\nFrom our list:\n- Game 1: 1 - 0 (Advantage = 1)\n- Game 2: 1 - 1 (Advantage = 0, tie)\n- Game 3: 2 - 1 (Advantage = 1)\n- Game 4: 2 - 2 (Advantage = 0, tie)\n- Game 5: 2 - 3 (Disadvantage = -1)\n- Game 6: 2 - 4 (Disadvantage = -2)\n\nThe highest advantage is \"2 - 1\" in Game 3, with an advantage of +1. Therefore, the series score \"2 - 4\" from Game 6 is not the highest.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Claim Against Game 6\n\nAccording to the claim:\n- The highest series should be \"2 - 4\".\n- It should occur on game 6.\n\nSince we determined that \"2 - 1\" in Game 3 has a higher advantage, the claim is false.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are those containing the series scores from all games.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the highest series of the season do not occur until May\" is true or false, we need to analyze the 'series' column in the given table for each game entry.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: \n   - The claim suggests that the highest point in the series (i.e., the furthest lead) by one team does not happen until May.\n   \n2. **Analyzing the 'Series' Column**:\n   - Each row in the data represents a game, and the 'series' column shows the current standing after each game.\n\n3. **Checking the Series Values**:\n   - Game 1 (April 20): \"1 - 0\" \u2192 Detroit leads.\n   - Game 2 (April 23): \"1 - 1\" \u2192 Series tied.\n   - Game 3 (April 25): \"2 - 1\" \u2192 Detroit leads again.\n   - Game 4 (April 27): \"2 - 2\" \u2192 Series tied again.\n   - Game 5 (April 29): \"2 - 3\" \u2192 Opponent leads.\n   - Game 6 (May 1): \"2 - 4\" \u2192 Opponent extends their lead.\n\n4. **Determining the Highest Lead**:\n   - The highest lead for Detroit occurs in Games 1 and 3, where they are leading the series by one game (\"1 - 0\" and \"2 - 1\").\n   - The highest lead for the opponent occurs after Game 6, with a \"2 - 4\" lead.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states that the highest series point does not occur until May.\n   - Since Detroit's highest lead (\"2 - 1\") is in April (Game 3), and not in May, the claim is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - We need to consider all rows for the 'series' column to determine when the highest series points occur.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells are those containing the 'series' values:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"series\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
