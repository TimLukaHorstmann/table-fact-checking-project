The Yankees appeared as an opponent.\n2. They did so only once in the entire dataset.\n3. This occurrence was specifically on September 1.\n\n### Evaluating the Data\n\nTo verify these points, we need to inspect the \"opponent\" column for any entries related to the Yankees and see if they appear more than once, particularly looking at the date of September 1.\n\n**Step-by-step Examination:**\n\n1. **Check Each Row in the 'opponent' Column:**\n   - We iterate through each row's \"opponent\" field to find all occurrences of \"yankees.\"\n\n2. **Identify Rows with Yankees as Opponent:**\n   - From the dataset:\n     - September 1: The opponent is listed as \"yankees.\"\n     - There are no further mentions of \"yankees\" in any subsequent rows.\n\n3. **Confirm Single Occurrence on September 1:**\n   - We confirm that \"yankees\" appear only once and that it occurs on the date mentioned, September 1.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The Yankees appear as an opponent precisely one time.\n- This single occurrence is indeed on September 1.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim holds true. The relevant cell for this conclusion comes from row index 0 in the \"opponent\" column which contains \"yankees,\" confirming both parts of the claim regarding frequency and specific date.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
