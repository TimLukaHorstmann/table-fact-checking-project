    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"only 4 of the schools in Manawatu go up to year 13,\" we need to identify which schools are located in the Manawatu region and check their 'years' column to see if they extend to year 13.\n\nFrom the provided data, we can determine that the relevant columns for this task are \"area\" (to identify if a school is in Manawatu) and \"years\" (to check which schools go up to year 13). The region of interest here is primarily \"pahiatua,\" as it is located in the Manawatu-Wanganui region. Additionally, we should consider other areas that might be part of this region based on the context.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Schools in Manawatu:**\n   - Look for schools with \"area\" values indicating they are in Manawatu. In this case, schools located in \"pahiatua\" and possibly others like \"dannevirke\" (given its proximity) might be considered part of Manawatu.\n\n2. **Check 'Years' Column:**\n   - For each identified school, check the \"years\" column to see if it includes \"9 - 13\" or \"1 - 13,\" indicating that the school goes up to year 13.\n\n3. **Count Schools Going Up to Year 13:**\n   - Count how many of these schools have a 'years' range extending to year 13.\n\nLet's apply this to the data:\n\n- **Pahiatua Schools:**\n  - \"hillcrest school\": Years 1-8\n  - \"pahiatua school\": Years 1-8\n  - \"st anthony 's school\": Years 1-8\n  - \"tararua college\": Years 9-13 (goes up to year 13)\n  - \"tkkm o tamaki nui a rua\": Years 1-13 (goes up to year 13)\n\n- **Dannevirke Schools:**\n  - \"akitio school\": Years 1-8\n  - \"dannevirke high school\": Years 9-13 (goes up to year 13)\n  - \"dannevirke south school\": Years 1-8\n  - \"huia range school\": Years 1-8\n  - \"st joseph 's school\": Years 1-8\n  - \"tkkm o tamaki nui a rua\": Already counted (Years 1-13)\n  - \"totara college of accelerated learning\": Years 1-13 (goes up to year 13)\n\nFrom this, we have identified four schools that go up to year 13 in the Manawatu region:\n1. Tararua College\n2. TKKM o Tamaki Nui a Rua\n3. Dannevirke High School\n4. Totara College of Accelerated Learning\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"area\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"area\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"area\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"area\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"years\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"at 476, the highest roll belongs to Dannevirke High School.\"\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: \n   - We are interested in the column named \"roll,\" as this contains the number of students enrolled (the roll).\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - We need to check the values in the \"roll\" column across all rows to identify the highest value and see if it belongs to Dannevirke High School.\n\n3. **Check Specific Entry**:\n   - According to the claim, Dannevirke High School has a roll of 476. Let's verify this entry.\n   - The row for Dannevirke High School is at index 3 (considering zero-based indexing), and its \"roll\" value is indeed 476.\n\n4. **Verify If This Is the Highest Roll**:\n   - We need to compare this roll number with all other entries in the \"roll\" column.\n   - Upon examining each row, we find that 476 is the highest value in the \"roll\" column.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since 476 is indeed the highest roll and it belongs to Dannevirke High School, the claim is true.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells for verifying this claim are those containing the \"roll\" values of all schools, specifically including the row for Dannevirke High School.\n\nBased on the above analysis, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"roll\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Whether \"Dannevirke High School\" has this highest roll value.\n\nLet's examine the data:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Highest Roll Value\n\nThe relevant column for determining the highest roll is \"roll\". We will look through each row to find the maximum value in this column.\n\n- Akitio School: Roll = 7\n- Alfredton School: Roll = 44\n- Ballance School: Roll = 28\n- Dannevirke High School: Roll = 476\n- Dannevirke South School: Roll = 347\n- Eketahuna School: Roll = 91\n- Hillcrest School: Roll = 46\n- Huia Range School: Roll = 246\n- Kumeroa - HopeLands School: Roll = 63\n- Makuri School: Roll = 7\n- Mangamaire Country School: Roll = 29\n- Mangatainoka School: Roll = 63\n- Norsewood and Districts School: Roll = 113\n- Pahiatua School: Roll = 259\n- Papatawa School: Roll = 13\n- Pongaroa School: Roll = 59\n- Ruahine School: Roll = 176\n- St Anthony's School: Roll = 141\n- St Joseph's School: Roll = 103\n- Tararua College: Roll = 330\n- TKKM o Tamaki Nui a Rua: Roll = 73\n- Totara College of Accelerated Learning: Roll = 47\n- Weber School: Roll = 64\n- Woodville School: Roll = 143\n\nThe highest roll value is **476**, which belongs to \"Dannevirke High School\".\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Claim\n\nThe claim states, \"at 576, the highest roll belongs to Dannevirke High School.\" However, we found that the highest roll is actually **476**, not 576. Therefore, the claim about the roll number being 576 is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the highest roll value in the dataset is 476 and not 576, the claim is false.\n\nHere are the relevant cells to verify this:\n\n- The row with \"Dannevirke High School\" for the \"roll\" column (row index 3).\n- All rows for comparison of the \"roll\" values to confirm 476 is indeed the highest.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"roll\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
