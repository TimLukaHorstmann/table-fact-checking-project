    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data in the table for the year 1998.\n\nThe claim states: \"in 1998 , n / a win the lifetime achievement award.\" This means we must check if the value under the \"lifetime achievement\" column for the year 1998 is \"na\".\n\n1. Identify the row corresponding to the year 1998 in the data:\n   - The rows are indexed starting from 0, so the year 1996 corresponds to index 0.\n   - Therefore, the year 1997 corresponds to index 1, and subsequently, the year 1998 corresponds to index 2.\n\n2. Locate the relevant column for \"lifetime achievement\":\n   - From the columns list: `[\"year\", \"best teenage / young adult\", \"reader 's vote\", \"best non-fiction\", \"lifetime achievement\"]`, we see that \"lifetime achievement\" is in the fifth position (index 4).\n\n3. Check the value at row index 2 and column index 4:\n   - According to the table data: `[[\"na\"]]` for this location.\n\nThe value in the specified cell matches \"na\", which supports the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cell is at row index 2 in the \"lifetime achievement\" column.

The value under the column \"reader's vote\" should not be \"na\".\n2. Simultaneously, the value under the column \"lifetime achievement\" should also be \"na\".\n\nWe will analyze the data row by row to identify any instances that satisfy both conditions. Here is the step-by-step examination of each relevant row:\n\n- **1996**: \n  - Reader's vote: \"na\"\n  - Lifetime Achievement: \"jon cleary\"\n  - Does not meet the condition.\n\n- **1997**: \n  - Reader's vote: \"na\"\n  - Lifetime Achievement: \"alan yates (aka carter brown)\"\n  - Does not meet the condition.\n\n- **1998**: \n  - Reader's vote: \"na\"\n  - Lifetime Achievement: \"na\"\n  - Meets neither condition since both values are \"na\".\n\n- **1999**: \n  - Reader's vote: \"na\"\n  - Lifetime Achievement: \"peter corris\"\n  - Does not meet the condition.\n\n- **2000**: \n  - Reader's vote: \"na\"\n  - Lifetime Achievement: \"na\"\n  - Meets neither condition since both values are \"na\".\n\n- **2001**: \n  - Reader's vote: \"bleeding hearts by lindy cameron\"\n  - Lifetime Achievement: \"professor stephen knight\"\n  - Does not meet the condition.\n\n- **2002**: \n  - Reader's vote: \"apartment 255 by bunty avieson\"\n  - Lifetime Achievement: \"patrick gallagher\"\n  - Does not meet the condition.\n\n- **2003**: \n  - Reader's vote: \"na\"\n  - Lifetime Achievement: \"kerry greenwood\"\n  - Does not meet the condition.\n\n- **2004**: \n  - Reader's vote: \"na\"\n  - Lifetime Achievement: \"bob bottom\"\n  - Does not meet the condition.\n\n- **2005**: \n  - Reader's vote: \"na\"\n  - Lifetime Achievement: \"stuart coupe\"\n  - Does not meet the condition.\n\n- **2006**: \n  - Reader's vote: \"na\"\n  - Lifetime Achievement: \"andrew rule and john silvester\"\n  - Does not meet the condition.\n\n- **2007**: \n  - Reader's vote: \"na\"\n  - Lifetime Achievement: \"sandra harvey and lindsay simpson\"\n  - Does not meet the condition.\n\n- **2008**: \n  - Reader's vote: \"na\"\n  - Lifetime Achievement: \"marele day\"\n  - Does not meet the condition.\n\n- **2009**: \n  - Reader's vote: \"na\"\n  - Lifetime Achievement: \"shane maloney\"\n  - Does not meet the condition.\n\n- **2010**: \n  - Reader's vote: \"na\"\n  - Lifetime Achievement: \"peter doyle\"\n  - Does not meet the condition.\n\n- **2011**: \n  - Reader's vote: \"na\"\n  - Lifetime Achievement: \"na\"\n  - Meets neither condition since both values are \"na\".\n\nAfter examining each row, we find that there are no instances where the reader's vote is not \"na\" while the lifetime achievement is also \"na\". Consequently, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
