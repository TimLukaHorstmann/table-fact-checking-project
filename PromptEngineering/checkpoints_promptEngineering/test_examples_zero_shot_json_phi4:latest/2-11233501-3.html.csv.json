    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to determine if the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SRJ) played 10 fewer years than the country with the second highest number of years played.\n\n1. **Identify Years Played:**\n   - Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRJ): 19 years (1969 - 1992)\n   - Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SRJ): 9 years (1995 - 2003)\n   - Serbia and Montenegro (SCG): 3 years (2004 - 2006)\n   - Serbia (SRB): 7 years (2007 - present, assuming current year is 2023, which makes it 16 years)\n\n2. **Calculate Total Years Played for Serbia:**\n   - Serbia's total from \"Serbia and Montenegro\" and \"Serbia\":\n     - SCG: 3 years\n     - SRB: 16 years (2007 to 2023)\n     - Total for Serbia = 3 + 16 = 19 years\n\n3. **Determine the Country with the Highest Number of Years Played:**\n   - SFRJ: 19 years\n   - Overall (Serbia including all periods): 19 years\n   - SRJ: 9 years\n\n4. **Identify the Second Highest Number of Years Played:**\n   - The highest is 19 years (SFRJ and overall Serbia).\n   - The second highest is also 19 years (considering Serbia as a continuation).\n\n5. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - SRJ played 9 years.\n   - The country with the second highest number of years played is either SFRJ or Serbia, both at 19 years.\n   - Difference = 19 - 9 = 10 years.\n\nThe claim is true because SRJ indeed played 10 fewer years than the countries with the highest and second-highest number of years played.\n\nRelevant cells to verify:\n- Row index for SRJ: 1\n- Column name: \"years played\"\n- Row index for SFRJ: 0 (or overall Serbia)\n- Column name: \"years played\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"years played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"years played\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
