Check if this player's statistics include 17995 runs and 708 wickets.\n\nLet's break down these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Player with the Second Highest Number of Matches\n\nFrom the \"matches\" column, we list all players by their match count in descending order:\n- Shane Warne: 145 matches\n- Glenn McGrath: 124 matches\n- Brett Lee: 76 matches (tie)\n- Jason Gillespie: 71 matches (tie)\n- Craig McDer-mott: 71 matches (tie)\n- Dennis Lillee: 70 matches\n- Richie Benaud: 63 matches\n- Graham McKenzie: 60 matches\n- Ray Lindwall: 61 matches\n- Clarrie Grimmett: 37 matches\n- Merv Hughes: 53 matches\n- Stuart MacGill: 44 matches\n- Mitchell Johnson: 50 matches\n\nSorting by the number of matches, we see that Shane Warne has the highest with 145 matches. Glenn McGrath follows closely with 124 matches, making him the player with the second-highest match count.\n\n### Step 2: Check Glenn McGrath's Statistics for 17995 Runs and 708 Wickets\n\nNow we need to verify if Glenn McGrath has 17995 runs and 708 wickets:\n- Glenn McGrath's \"runs\": 12186\n- Glenn McGrath's \"wickets\": 563\n\nThe claim specifies 17995 runs and 708 wickets.
