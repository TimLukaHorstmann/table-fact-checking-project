    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Brian Peterson lose in 3 round, with a time of 1:51\" is true or false, we need to examine relevant entries from the table of mixed martial arts fight records.\n\n### Breakdown of Claim Verification:\n\n1. **Fighter Name**: The claim specifies Brian Peterson as the fighter.\n2. **Outcome**: It states that Brian Peterson lost the match.\n3. **Number of Rounds**: The claim indicates the match was 3 rounds long.\n4. **Time**: The time given for the result is 1:51.\n\n### Relevant Cells to Check:\n\n- **Row Index**: We need to identify which row in the table corresponds to a fight involving Brian Peterson.\n- **Columns**:\n  - Fighter name to confirm it's \"Brian Peterson\".\n  - Result column to verify if he lost or won.\n  - Rounds column to check for the match being 3 rounds long.\n  - Time column to see if the time is specified as 1:51.\n\n### Analysis of Relevant Data:\n\n- **Row Index 24**:\n  - Fighter Name: \"Brian Peterson\"\n  - Result: \"win\" (not a loss)\n  - Rounds: 3\n  - Time: \"1:51\"\n\nFrom this analysis, we observe that Brian Peterson won the match in 3 rounds with a time of 1:51. Thus, the claim is incorrect regarding both the outcome and his performance.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim that Brian Peterson lost in 3 rounds with a time of 1:51 is **false**.\n- Relevant cells are from Row Index 24 for the columns \"Fighter Name\", \"Result\", \"Rounds\", and \"Time\".\n\nHere's the JSON object as required:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Fighter Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Rounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
