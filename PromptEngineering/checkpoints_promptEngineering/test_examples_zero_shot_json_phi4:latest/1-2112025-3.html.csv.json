    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"in the final after 1968 durr 's opponent be billie jean and owen king,\" we need to break down the conditions implied by this statement:\n\n1. The event must have occurred after the year 1968.\n2. Durr's opponents in the final should include both Billie Jean King and Owen Davidson.\n\nWe will examine each relevant row from the table for these conditions:\n\n- **Year > 1968**: We need to consider the years 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, and 1973.\n- **Opponents in the Final**: Check if \"Billie Jean King\" and \"Owen Davidson\" are listed together as opponents.\n\nLet's go through each row step-by-step:\n\n1. **Row Index 1 (1969 French Open)**\n   - Year: 1969\n   - Opponents: \"Billie Jean King Owen Davidson\"\n   - Both Billie Jean King and Owen Davidson are mentioned, satisfying the condition for opponents.\n   - This is after 1968.\n\n2. **Rows for Years 1970-1973**:\n   - We will check each row to see if both Billie Jean King and Owen Davidson appear as opponents together.\n   \n   - **Row Index 3 (1970 French Open)**\n     - Opponents: \"Billie Jean King Bob Hewitt\"\n     - Only one of the specified players, so this does not satisfy the opponent condition.\n\n   - **Row Index 4 (1971 French Open)**\n     - Opponents: \"Winnie Shaw Thomas Lejus\"\n     - Neither player is listed, so this does not satisfy the opponent condition.\n\n   - **Row Index 5 (1972 French Open)**\n     - Opponents: \"Evonne Goolagong Cawley Kim Warwick\"\n     - Neither player is listed, so this does not satisfy the opponent condition.\n\n   - **Row Index 6 (1973 French Open)**\n     - Opponents: \"Betty St\u00f6ve Patrice Dominguez\"\n     - Neither player is listed, so this does not satisfy the opponent condition.\n\nBased on the analysis, only Row Index 1 meets all conditions of the claim.
