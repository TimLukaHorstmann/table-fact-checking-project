To verify the claim, we will focus on two aspects:\n1. Attendance numbers for all games.\n2. Whether week 4's game was indeed at Texas Stadium.\n\nLet's analyze step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Attendances\nWe need to compare attendance figures across all weeks listed in the table. The relevant column here is \"attendance\".\n\n- **Week 1**: Attendance = 63,431\n- **Week 2**: Attendance = 50,705\n- **Week 3**: Attendance = 49,578\n- **Week 4**: Attendance = 46,267\n- **Week 5**: Attendance = 54,633\n- **Week 6**: Attendance = 51,808\n- **Week 7**: Attendance = 64,506\n- **Week 8**: Attendance = 46,199\n- **Week 9**: Attendance = 60,007\n\n### Step 2: Identify Game Site for Week 4\nThe claim specifies that the game with the greatest attendance happened at Texas Stadium during week 4. We need to confirm:\n- The location of week 4's game.\n\nFrom the table data:\n- **Week 4**: Game site = \"texas stadium\"\n\n### Step 3: Compare Attendances\nNow we compare all attendances to see if week 4 has the highest attendance.\n- Highest Attendance is in Week 7 with 64,506 attendees.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim states that week 4 had the greatest attendance at Texas Stadium. However:\n- The actual highest attendance was recorded in Week 7 (64,506), which also occurred at Texas Stadium but not during Week 4.\n- Week 4's game site is correctly identified as Texas Stadium, but its attendance of 46,267 is lower than that of any other week.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is **FALSE**. The relevant cells to verify this are those containing the \"attendance\" figures and the \"game site\" for week 4.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
