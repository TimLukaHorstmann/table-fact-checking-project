    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"in season of 2005, the sum of pole with the series of formula three sudamericana be 1,\" we need to identify and examine the relevant data in the table for the year 2005 under the \"Formula Three Sudamericana\" series.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - We need to locate rows where the \"season\" is \"2005\" and the \"series\" is \"Formula Three Sudamericana.\"\n\n2. **Extract Pole Positions:**\n   - For each relevant row, extract the number of poles (from the column named \"poles\").\n\n3. **Sum the Poles:**\n   - Sum up all the pole positions extracted from these rows.\n\n4. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - The claim states that this sum should be 1. We need to check if our calculated sum matches this value.\n\n### Detailed Examination:\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Season: \"2005\"\n  - Series: \"Formula Three Sudamericana\"\n  - Poles: 1\n\nThis row satisfies both conditions (season and series). It contributes a pole count of 1.\n\n- There are no other rows for the season 2005 with the series \"Formula Three Sudamericana.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe sum of poles for the \"Formula Three Sudamericana\" in 2005 is indeed 1, which matches the claim.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cell in this context is from row index 4, column \"poles\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"poles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Therefore, any potential matches must include years like 2001 or earlier.\n\n- **Check for `wins = 0`**:\n  - For each row, verify if `\"wins\"` equals 0.\n  \n- **Identify series as \"formula renault 2.0 brazil\"**:\n  - If a row with `\"wins\" = 0` exists, confirm that the `\"series\"` column matches `\"formula renault 2.0 brazil\"`.\n\nNow, let's go through the data:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Season is 2002, so not applicable.\n2. **Row 1**: Season is 2003, so not applicable.\n3. **Row 2**: Season is 2004, so not applicable.\n4. **Row 3**: Season is 2005, so not applicable.\n5. **Row 4**: Season is 2005, `\"wins\" = 0`, but the series is \"formula renault 2.0 brazil\".
