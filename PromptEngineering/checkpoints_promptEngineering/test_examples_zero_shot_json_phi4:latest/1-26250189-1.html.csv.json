We need to find a row where the \"theme\" column has the value \"the rolling stones\". Looking through the provided data, we identify one such entry:\n   - Row index 7: [\"top 12\", \"the rolling stones\", \"wild horses\", \"the rolling stones\", \"6\", \"safe\"]\n\n2. Next, verify the \"order\" for this row. The order in this row is indeed \"6\".\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are met (theme matches and order is 6), we can conclude that the statement is true.\n\nThus, the JSON response will be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"order\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
