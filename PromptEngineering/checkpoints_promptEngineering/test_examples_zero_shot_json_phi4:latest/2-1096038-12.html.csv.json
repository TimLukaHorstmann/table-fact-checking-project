    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"15 match be win in 2 set\" is true based on the provided table data, we need to verify two conditions from each row of match data:\n\n1. The number of matches should total 15.\n2. Out of these matches, there should be at least 15 wins in straight sets (i.e., winning both sets).\n\nLet's break down each condition step by step and identify the relevant cells.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n**Condition 1: Total Matches**\n\nWe have 21 entries in the \"data\" list. This means there are 21 matches recorded, which is more than the claimed number of 15 matches. However, since we're interested in verifying if at least 15 match outcomes meet a specific condition (winning both sets), having more matches is not an issue as long as we find at least 15 wins in two straight sets.\n\n**Condition 2: Wins in Two Sets**\n\nWe'll go through each row and check the \"result\" column to see if there are at least 15 wins with both sets won. A win in two sets would typically be represented by scores like \"6-3, 6-4\", indicating that all matches were won without losing a set.\n\nLet's evaluate the results:\n\n1. **1985 (row index 0)**: Won, 6-2, 6-0\n2. **1986 (row index 1)**: Won, 7-5, 6-3\n3. **1988 (row index 2)**: Won, 6-3, 6-4\n4. **1989 (row index 3)**: Won, 6-0, 6-4\n5. **1991 (row index 4)**: Won, 6-3, 6-4\n6. **1993 (row index 8)**: Won, 6-0, 6-2\n7. **1994 (row index 12)**: Won, 6-0, 6-3\n8. **1994 (row index 13)**: Won, 6-2, 6-1\n\nThese rows show wins in two sets. Let's continue checking:\n\n9. **1985 (row index 5)**: Lost, 6-3, 2-6, 2-6\n10. **1991 (row index 15)**: Lost, 2-6, 1-6\n11. **1992 (row index 16)**: Won, 6-3, 4-6, 0-6\n12. **1992 (row index 17)**: Won, 6-1, 6-0\n13. **1992 (row index 18)**: Won, 6-3, 6-4\n14. **1993 (row index 19)**: Lost, 1-6, 5-7\n15. **1994 (row index 20)**: Lost, 3-6, 6-3, 2-6\n\nWe have identified the following wins in straight sets (from above analysis): rows 0 to 4 and 8 to 13.\n\nCounting these, we have:\n- Rows with wins in two sets: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 13\n- Total = 8 matches\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe claim requires at least 15 matches won in straight sets. However, from the analysis above, we found only 8 such wins. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nRelevant cells are those that have both \"round\" and \"result\" information for each row checked.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"thirty match be win in 2 set\" is true based on the given table data, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that there were thirty matches won in two sets. This means for a match to count towards this claim, it must have been completed with a victory by winning both sets.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - We are interested in the \"result\" column since it contains information about how each match was won or lost.\n   - Each result entry is formatted as \"X - Y, Z - W\", where X and Z represent set scores for the player of interest, while Y and W represent their opponent's scores.\n\n3. **Criteria for a 2-Set Win**:\n   - A match is considered a win in two sets if it has only two entries (e.g., \"6 - 4, 6 - 2\") indicating that both sets were won by the player of interest.\n\n4. **Count Matches Won in Two Sets**:\n   - We'll go through each row and check the \"result\" column.\n   - Count how many matches have results formatted as two winning sets (e.g., \"X - Y, Z - W\", where X > Y and Z > W).\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - If there are exactly 30 such matches, the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nNow let's evaluate each row:\n\n- Rows with results like \"6 - 4, 6 - 2\" or similar (both sets won) are considered wins in two sets.\n- Rows with a result of \"W/O\", retirements, or three-set matches are not counted as 2-set wins.\n\nLet's count the matches won in two sets:\n\n1. **1989**: \n   - Match 1: \"6 - 3, 6 - 2\" (Win)\n   - Match 2: \"7 - 5, 6 - 0\" (Win)\n\n2. **1990**:\n   - Match 1: \"6 - 3, 6 - 4\" (Win)\n   - Match 2: \"6 - 2, 6 - 3\" (Win)\n\n3. **1991**:\n   - Match 1: \"6 - 0, 6 - 2\" (Win)\n\n4. **1992**:\n   - No match won in two sets.\n\n5. **1993**:\n   - Match 1: \"6 - 0, 6 - 2\" (Win)\n\n6. **1994**:\n   - Match 1: \"6 - 0, 6 - 3\" (Win)\n   - Match 2: \"6 - 2, 6 - 1\" (Win)\n\n7. **Count the Wins**:\n   - Total wins in two sets from the data are: 8 matches.\n\nSince there are only 8 matches won in two sets, not 30 as claimed, the statement is false.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim specifically mentions \"8 tie breakers,\" which suggests that there should be two sets in the match with scores ending in 7-6, indicating the occurrence of tiebreakers.\n\nHere's how we can verify the claim:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Match**: We need to find the entry where the opponent is Nathalie Tauziat.\n   \n2. **Check for Tiebreakers**: Look at the \"result\" column to see if there are scores indicating tiebreakers, which are typically represented as 7-6 in favor of one player or the other.\n\nLet's go through the data:\n\n- The match against Nathalie Tauziat is found in the entry:\n  - Round: r2\n  - Date: 21 July 1992\n  - Opponent: Nathalie Tauziat\n  - Result: \"6 - 1, 6 - 0\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Result**: The result \"6 - 1, 6 - 0\" does not indicate any tiebreakers. A tiebreaker would be indicated by a score of 7-6 in either set.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since there are no scores of 7-6, there were no tiebreakers in this match.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"there be 8 tie breaker in the match against Nathalie Tauziat\" is false.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
