    "resp": "To verify the claim that \"the piz bernina located in Switzerland has a higher elevation at 4049 (m) than S\u00e4ntis,\" we need to focus on two key aspects from the data: the location and elevation of both Piz Bernina and S\u00e4ntis. Let's go through these steps systematically:\n\n1. **Identify the Rows**:\n   - Find the row where \"Piz Bernina\" is listed.\n   - Find the row where \"S\u00e4ntis\" is listed.\n\n2. **Check Locations**:\n   - Confirm that Piz Bernina is indeed located in Switzerland.\n   - Ensure S\u00e4ntis's location is also identified for completeness, although it should be known to be a peak within Switzerland as well.\n\n3. **Compare Elevations**:\n   - Extract the elevation of Piz Bernina from its respective row and verify it matches 4049 meters as stated in the claim.\n   - Compare this elevation with that of S\u00e4ntis to determine if Piz Bernina is indeed higher.\n\nLet's apply these steps using the data provided:\n\n- **Piz Bernina**:\n  - Found in Row Index: 1\n  - Location: Switzerland (from \"Switzerland, Italy\")\n  - Elevation: 4049 meters\n\n- **S\u00e4ntis**:\n  - Found in Row Index: 2\n  - Location: Switzerland (implicitly understood from context and the data table)\n  - Elevation: 2501 meters\n\nUpon examining these details:\n- Piz Bernina is located in Switzerland, matching the claim's condition.\n- The elevation of Piz Bernina is indeed 4049 meters, as specified.\n- S\u00e4ntis has an elevation of 2501 meters.\n\nSince 4049 meters (Piz Bernina) is greater than 2501 meters (S\u00e4ntis), the claim is fully supported by the data. Thus, the answer is \"TRUE.\"\n\nThe relevant cells that were checked to verify this claim are:\n- Piz Bernina's location and elevation: Row Index 1\n- S\u00e4ntis's elevation: Row Index 2\n\nHere is the JSON response as requested:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Elevation (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Elevation (m)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
