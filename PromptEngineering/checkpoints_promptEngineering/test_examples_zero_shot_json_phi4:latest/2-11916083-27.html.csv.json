Since all relevant entries have an issue price of $15.95, we need to verify if this can logically represent 1/3 of a total.\n\nIf $15.95 is indeed 1/3, then the total would be:\n\\[ \\text{Total} = 15.95 \\times 3 = 47.85 \\]\n\nHowever, there are no entries in the table with an issue price of $47.85 or any indication that $24.95 (the other listed price) is related to this calculation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim does not specify a total amount from which $15.95 could be one-third, nor is there evidence in the table supporting such a relationship. The entries simply list $15.95 as an issue price for certain themes without further context linking it to being 1/3 of another value.\n\nThus, based on the information provided and the absence of any supporting data or context, the claim cannot be verified as true.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

From our analysis:\n\n- In 2008, we confirmed entries with prices $15.95 and $24.95.\n- In 2009, only a price of $24.95 is listed.\n\nSince the claim does not specify a particular year for both prices to be available simultaneously in any single entry but rather generally across years, and since these two prices are found in different entries within the context of the year 2008, we can consider this condition satisfied across multiple years (as there is no specific restriction on all prices needing to appear in one year).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is supported by the data as both prices $24.95 and $15.95 are present for the Toronto Maple Leafs coins, albeit in different entries across 2008.\n\nHere's the JSON response with relevant cell information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe identified cells (indices 9 and 10) correspond to the issue prices of $15.95 and $24.95 for the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2008, which are crucial for validating the claim.",
