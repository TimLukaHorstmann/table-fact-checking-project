Here is a breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Year**: Look for the row where \"year\" equals \"2011\".\n2. **Check Team Column**: Within this row, verify what team is listed in the \"team\" column.\n3. **Determine Truthfulness**: Compare the actual team name with \"new orleans saint\".\n\nFollowing these steps:\n\n- Locate the row where \"year\" = 2011. This corresponds to the eighth row (index 7) in zero-based indexing, given that each row starts at index 0 for the header.\n- Check the value in the \"team\" column of this row.\n\nThe data from the table is as follows:\n- For year 2011: `[\"2011\", \"new orleans saints\", \"54\", 36, 0.0, 0]`\n\nIn the eighth row (index 7), under the \"team\" column, it states \"new orleans saints\".
