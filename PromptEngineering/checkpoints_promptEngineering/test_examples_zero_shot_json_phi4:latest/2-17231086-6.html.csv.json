    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the data provided in the table and focus on identifying players whose scores are over par.\n\nFirstly, let's clarify what \"over par\" means. In golf, par refers to the expected number of strokes a skilled golfer would take to complete a hole, a round, or a course. A score is considered:\n- Under par (negative numbers like -1, -2) when it takes fewer strokes than par.\n- Even par (\"e\") when it matches par exactly.\n- Over par (positive numbers like +1, +2, etc.) when it takes more strokes than par.\n\nThe claim states: \"a majority of the people who score over par be from the united state.\"\n\nTo evaluate this claim, we will:\n1. Identify all players whose scores are over par.\n2. Count how many of these players are from the United States.\n3. Determine if they constitute a majority (more than half) of the players scoring over par.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant data:\n\n- Curtis Strange has a score to par of \"- 2\" (under par).\n- Chip Beck, Mark McCumber, and Ian Woosnam have scores to par of \"- 1\" (under par).\n- Brian Claar has a score to par of \"e\" (even par).\n- Masashi Ozaki and Scott Simpson have scores to par of \"+ 1\".\n- Peter Jacobsen has a score to par of \"+ 2\".\n- Paul Azinger, Hubert Green, Tom Kite, and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal have scores to par of \"+ 3\".\n\nNow, let's list the players who scored over par:\n\n- Masashi Ozaki (\"+ 1\", from Japan)\n- Scott Simpson (\"+ 1\", from United States)\n- Peter Jacobsen (\"+ 2\", from United States)\n- Paul Azinger (\"+ 3\", from United States)\n- Hubert Green (\"+ 3\", from United States)\n- Tom Kite (\"+ 3\", from United States)\n- Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal (\"+ 3\", from Spain)\n\nCounting these:\n- Total players over par: 7\n- Players from the United States over par: Scott Simpson, Peter Jacobsen, Paul Azinger, Hubert Green, and Tom Kite (5 players).\n\nA majority means more than half. In this case, 5 out of 7 is indeed a majority.\n\nThus, the claim that \"a majority of the people who score over par be from the united state\" is true.\n\nNow, we identify relevant cells in the table for these calculations:\n\n- Row indices for players scoring over par: 6 (Scott Simpson), 7 (Masashi Ozaki), 8 (Peter Jacobsen), 9 (Paul Azinger), 10 (Hubert Green), 11 (Tom Kite), 12 (Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal).\n- Columns relevant to check are \"country\" and \"to par\".\n\nHere is the JSON object reflecting the solution:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

His earnings are $67,823.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that \"the most amount of money won by someone from Wales be 46823,\" but Ian Woosnam actually earned $67,823.
