Let's analyze each relevant row:\n\n1. **Game 75:** \n   - Date: April 1\n   - High Points: Brandan Wright (15)\n   - Jordan Farmar did not lead in points.\n\n2. **Game 76:** \n   - Date: April 3\n   - High Points: Deron Williams (18)\n   - Jordan Farmar did not lead in points.\n\n3. **Game 77:** \n   - Date: April 5\n   - High Points: Brook Lopez (30)\n   - Jordan Farmar did not lead in points.\n\n4. **Game 78:** \n   - Date: April 6\n   - High Points: Brook Lopez (39)\n   - Jordan Farmar did not lead in points.\n\n5. **Game 79:** \n   - Date: April 8\n   - High Points: Brook Lopez (27)\n   - Jordan Farmar did not lead in points.\n\n6. **Game 80:** \n   - Date: April 10\n   - High Points: Brook Lopez (35)\n   - Jordan Farmar did not lead in points.\n\n7. **Game 81:** \n   - Date: April 11\n   - High Points: Brook Lopez (31)\n   - Jordan Farmar did not lead in points.\n\nUpon examining the data, it's clear that Jordan Farmar never led the team in points for any of these games, let alone five consecutive games. The \"high points\" column consistently shows other players with higher individual scores than Jordan Farmar throughout all listed games. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nHere are the relevant cells to verify this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to assess two parts of the statement:\n\n1. The game with the highest attendance was against Minnesota.\n2. This game took place at the Prudential Center.\n\nWe will examine each entry in the data column under \"location attendance\" and identify which one has the highest value, checking if it corresponds to a game against Minnesota at the Prudential Center.\n\n- **Step 1:** Identify the highest attendance figure from the table:\n\n  - Philadelphia: 16695\n  - Miami: 18711\n  - Minnesota: 13461\n  - Detroit: 14554\n  - New York: 18023\n  - Toronto: 17755\n  - Charlotte: 13853\n\n- **Step 2:** Determine the game with the highest attendance:\n  \n  The game against Miami has the highest attendance of 18711.\n\n- **Step 3:** Check if this game was against Minnesota and at Prudential Center:\n\n  The game against Miami had an attendance of 18711. It was played at the Prudential Center, but not against Minnesota (it was against Minnesota that the game had an attendance of 13461).\n\nThus, the claim \"the most highly attended game be against minnesota at the prudential center\" is false because the highest attendance was actually for a game against Miami, not Minnesota.\n\n**Relevant cells:**\n- Attendance figures and corresponding locations/teams are relevant.\n  \nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
