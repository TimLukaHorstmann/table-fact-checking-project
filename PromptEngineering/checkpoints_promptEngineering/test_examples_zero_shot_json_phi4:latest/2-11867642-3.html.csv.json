The date must be on or before May 28.\n2. The attendance must be exactly 39,000.\n\nWe will examine relevant entries from the provided table data that meet the condition of having \"d - backs\" listed as the opponent and check their dates and attendances against these conditions.\n\n#### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Opponent \"d - backs\":**\n   The data rows involving \"d - backs\" are:\n   - May 5\n   - May 6\n   - May 7\n   - May 26\n   - May 27\n   - May 28\n\n2. **Check Dates and Attendances:**\n\n   - **May 5:** \n     - Date is earlier than May 28.\n     - Attendance = 21,077 (not 39,000).\n\n   - **May 6:** \n     - Date is earlier than May 28.\n     - Attendance = 27,204 (not 39,000).\n\n   - **May 7:**\n     - Date is earlier than May 28.\n     - Attendance = 27,727 (not 39,000).\n\n   - **May 26:**\n     - Date is earlier than May 28.\n     - Attendance = 33,751 (not 39,000).\n\n   - **May 27:**\n     - Date is earlier than May 28.\n     - Attendance = 36,884 (not 39,000).\n\n   - **May 28:** \n     - Date matches exactly May 28.\n     - Attendance = 27,694 (not 39,000).\n\nAfter reviewing all the games against \"d - backs\" that occurred on or before May 28, none of them have an attendance of 39,000. Therefore, there is no date meeting both conditions outlined in the claim.\n\nThe claim is thus FALSE because no game against \"d - backs\" occurring on or before May 28 had an attendance of exactly 39,000.\n\n#### Relevant Cells:\nFor verification, we focus on the following relevant cells:\n\n- **Row Index 4:** Date (May 5), Opponent (\"d - backs\"), Attendance (21,077)\n- **Row Index 5:** Date (May 6), Opponent (\"d - backs\"), Attendance (27,204)\n- **Row Index 6:** Date (May 7), Opponent (\"d - backs\"), Attendance (27,727)\n- **Row Index 19:** Date (May 26), Opponent (\"d - backs\"), Attendance (33,751)\n- **Row Index 20:** Date (May 27), Opponent (\"d - backs\"), Attendance (36,884)\n- **Row Index 21:** Date (May 28), Opponent (\"d - backs\"), Attendance (27,694)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The date must be May 3.\n2. On May 3, the score must be 7 - 3 against the Tigers.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions:\n\n### Condition Evaluation\n\n**Condition 1: Date Check**\n- We look for entries in the data where the \"date\" column is \"may 3.\"\n\nFrom the table:\n- The entry on \"may 3\" corresponds to row index 2 (considering zero-based indexing).\n\n**Condition 2: Score and Opponent Verification**\n- For the identified date, check if the score was \"7 - 3.\"\n- Additionally, verify that the opponent was \"tigers.\"\n\nFrom the table:\n- On \"may 3,\" the data entry is:\n  - \"opponent\": \"rockies\"\n  - \"score\": \"3 - 0\"\n\nThe score on May 3 is not \"7 - 3\" and the opponent is not \"tigers.\" Therefore, this condition fails for May 3.\n\n### Additional Check: Other Dates\nWe also need to verify if there are any other dates where both conditions (the score being \"7 - 3\" against the Tigers) are satisfied. If such a date exists, it would contradict the claim that May 3 is the only date with these specific conditions.\n\nReviewing each row in the table:\n- No entry has a date with an opponent as \"tigers\" and a score of \"7 - 3.\"\n\n### Conclusion\nSince neither May 3 nor any other date satisfies both conditions (score of \"7 - 3\" against \"tigers\"), the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\nTo verify this, we checked:\n- Row index 2 for \"date,\" \"opponent,\" and \"score.\"\n- All rows for \"opponent\" and \"score\" to ensure no other dates met the conditions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
