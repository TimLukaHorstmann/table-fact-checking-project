The relevant rows are indices 2 and 3:\n  - Row index 2: \n    - Year: 2008\n    - Theme: \"amethyst crystal\"\n    - Issue Price: 94.95\n  - Row index 3: \n    - Year: 2008\n    - Theme: \"sapphire crystal\"\n    - Issue Price: 94.95\n\n- For the theme, we need it to be \"amethyst crystal,\" which matches row index 2.\n\n- For the issue price, it should be 94.95, and again this condition is satisfied by row index 2.\n\nSince all conditions in the claim (\"year = 2008\", \"theme = amethyst crystal\", and \"issue price = 94.95\") are met by row index 2, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nThus, the answer is \"TRUE,\" and the relevant cells to verify this include:\n\n- Row index 2 with the column names: \"year\", \"theme\", and \"issue price\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The latest year in the dataset is 2011.\n\n3. **Identifying Relevant Entries:**\n   - Extract rows with a composition of \"99.99% silver\" and check their issue prices:\n     - Year 2008: Amethyst crystal, Sapphire crystal \u2014 Issue price = $94.95\n     - Year 2009: Blue crystal, Pink crystal \u2014 Issue price = $94.95\n     - Year 2010: Blue crystal, Tanzanite crystal \u2014 Issue price = $99.95\n     - Year 2011: Emerald crystal, Topaz crystal, Hyacinth red small crystal, Montana blue small crystal \u2014 Issue price = $114.95\n\n4. **Determining the Latest Entry:**\n   - The latest entries by year are from 2011 with compositions of \"99.99% silver.\"\n   - We need to check if their issue prices are less than $95.\n\n5. **Evaluating the Claim:**\n   - For all entries in 2011, the issue price is $114.95.\n   - Since $114.95 is not less than $95, the claim does not hold true for the latest pieces with a composition of \"99.99% silver.\"\n\n6. **Concluding the Analysis:**\n   - The relevant data from the table that must be considered are the issue prices of all entries in 2011 where the composition is \"99.99% silver.\"\n   - Row indices corresponding to these entries are 10, 11, 12, and 13.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
