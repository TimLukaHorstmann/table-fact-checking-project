    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two primary conditions:\n\n1. Identify matches played in Gavle during the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup.\n2. Determine if Tisha Venturini participated and how many matches she played at that location.\n\nLet's break down the steps using the data from the table:\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n1. **Identify Matches Played in Gavle**:\n   - The claim refers to matches played in Gavle during the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup.\n   - Relevant rows for this competition are those between index 0 and 6.\n\n2. **Locate Matches in Gavle**:\n   - Check the \"location\" column for entries of \"Gavle\".\n   - From the data:\n     - Row 1: Location is \"gavle\", match result is \"3 - 3\".\n     - Row 4: Location is \"gavle\", match result is \"4 - 0\".\n     - Row 6: Location is \"gavle\", match result is \"2 - 0\".\n\n   Thus, matches played in Gavle are at rows 1, 4, and 6.\n\n3. **Check Player Participation**:\n   - Review the \"lineup\" column to see if Tisha Venturini's name appears for these specific matches.\n   - Row 1: Lineup is \"start\".\n   - Row 4: Lineup is \"80' (cromwell)\".\n   - Row 6: Lineup is \"start\".\n\n   The term \"start\" indicates starting player(s) but does not list individual names. Without explicit mention of Tisha Venturini, we cannot assume she played.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the table data do not explicitly state that Tisha Venturini participated in any matches at Gavle during the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup, and only indicates \"start\" for lineup without naming her:\n\n- **The claim is FALSE** because there is no information confirming her participation or count of matches played specifically.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nRelevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- Row index 0: To confirm the competition.\n- Rows 1, 4, and 6 in the \"location\" column to identify Gavle matches.\n- Rows 1, 4, and 6 in the \"lineup\" column to check for Tisha Venturini's participation.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"lineup\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"lineup\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"lineup\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim \"1996 - 08 - 01 athens , ga start 2 - 1 gold medal match\", we need to verify each part of this statement against the relevant data in the table.\n\n1. **Date:** The claim specifies \"1996 - 08 - 01\". We should look for a row with this date.\n   \n2. **Location:** It mentions \"athens, ga\" as the location. This information should match the corresponding cell in the identified row.\n\n3. **Lineup/Role:** The term \"start\" refers to the lineup or role played during the match. Again, we check if this matches in the same row as the date and location.\n\n4. **Result:** The claim states the result was \"2 - 1\". This should be reflected in the respective cell of the identified row.\n\n5. **Competition Stage:** Finally, it mentions a \"gold medal match\" for the competition stage. We need to verify if this is indeed what's recorded in the same row.\n\nUpon examining the table data:\n\n- The row with index 10 contains:\n  - Date: \"1996 - 07 - 28\"\n  - Location: \"athens, ga\"\n  - Lineup: \"start\"\n  - Result: \"2 - 1 aet\"\n  - Competition: \"semifinal\"\n\n- The row with index 11 contains:\n  - Date: \"1996 - 08 - 01\"\n  - Location: \"athens, ga\"\n  - Lineup: \"start\"\n  - Result: \"2 - 1\"\n  - Competition: \"gold medal match\"\n\nThe data in row 11 aligns perfectly with all parts of the claim. Therefore, the statement is fully supported by the information in the table.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"lineup\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
