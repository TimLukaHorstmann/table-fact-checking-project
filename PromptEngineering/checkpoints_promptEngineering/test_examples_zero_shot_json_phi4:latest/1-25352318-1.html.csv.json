    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"racing engineering have a better rank than the m2 competition,\" we need to focus on the rankings (positions) of the teams associated with \"Racing Engineering\" and \"M2 Competition.\" \n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - For \"Racing Engineering\":\n     - In the 2011 GP2 Asia Series, the position is 23rd.\n     - In the 2011 GP2 Final, the position is 11th.\n     - In the 2012 GP2 Series, the position is 12th.\n\n   - For \"M2 Competition\":\n     - In the 2012 Toyota Racing Series, the position is 7th.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Positions:**\n   - The relevant positions for \"Racing Engineering\" are 23rd, 11th, and 12th.\n   - The relevant position for \"M2 Competition\" is 7th.\n\n3. **Compare Positions:**\n   - A lower numerical rank indicates a better performance (e.g., 1st is better than 2nd).\n   - Among the positions for \"Racing Engineering,\" the best (lowest) is 11th.\n   - The position for \"M2 Competition\" is 7th.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since 7th is a better rank than any of the ranks achieved by \"Racing Engineering\" (23rd, 11th, or 12th), the claim that \"racing engineering have a better rank than the m2 competition\" is false.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - For \"Racing Engineering,\" the relevant cells are:\n     - Row index 8, column \"position\" (GP2 Asia Series).\n     - Row index 9, column \"position\" (GP2 Final).\n     - Row index 10, column \"position\" (GP2 Series).\n\n   - For \"M2 Competition,\" the relevant cell is:\n     - Row index 11, column \"position\" (Toyota Racing Series).\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim:\n\n\"ISR Racing have 17 races, while Art Grand Prix have 3 more races than ISR Racing,\"\n\nwe need to verify two main parts of the statement:\n1. \"ISR Racing have 17 races.\"\n2. \"Art Grand Prix have 3 more races than ISR Racing.\"\n\nLet's analyze each part using the relevant data from the table:\n\n### Part 1: Verify \"ISR Racing have 17 races\"\n- Look for entries in the table where the team is \"ISR Racing\".\n- The entry for ISR Racing in the year 2011 (row index 10) shows:\n  - `races`: 17\n  This confirms that ISR Racing participated in 17 races.\n\n### Part 2: Verify \"Art Grand Prix have 3 more races than ISR Racing\"\n- Determine how many races Art Grand Prix had and compare it to the number of races for ISR Racing.\n- Look for entries in the table where the team is \"Art Grand Prix\".\n- The entry for Art Grand Prix in the year 2010 (row index 5) shows:\n  - `races`: 3\n- Calculate if Art Grand Prix had 3 more races than ISR Racing: \n  - According to ISR Racing's data, they participated in 17 races.\n  - If Art Grand Prix were to have 3 more races than ISR Racing, they would need to have 20 races. However, Art Grand Prix only has 3 races recorded.\n\n### Conclusion\n- The first part of the claim is true: ISR Racing did participate in 17 races.\n- The second part of the claim is false: Art Grand Prix did not have 3 more races than ISR Racing; they had fewer races (3 compared to 17).\n\nTherefore, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For \"ISR Racing have 17 races\": Row index 10, column \"races\"\n- For \"Art Grand Prix have 3 more races than ISR Racing\": Row index 5 for Art Grand Prix's race count and row index 10 for ISR Racing's race count\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"races\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"races\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
