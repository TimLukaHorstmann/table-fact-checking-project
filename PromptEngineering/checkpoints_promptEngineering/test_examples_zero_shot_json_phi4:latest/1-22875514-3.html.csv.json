    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Cole is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data in the table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\nThe claim states: \"Cole have 18 out of 50 field goals for a 360 average.\"\n\n1. **Field Goals Made and Attempted**: \n   - The claim mentions that Cole made 18 field goals out of 50 attempts.\n   \n2. **Field Goal Percentage**:\n   - The claim states a 360 percentage, which is not possible since percentages are typically expressed as values between 0 and 100.\n\n### Verification from the Table:\n\n- Locate Cole's data in the table: \n  - **Row Index**: 8 (Cole's row)\n  \n- Check the \"field goals\" column for Cole:\n  - The value given is \"18 - 50 360\".\n    - **Field Goals Made**: 18\n    - **Field Goals Attempted**: 50\n    - **Field Goal Percentage**: 360\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Field Goals Made and Attempted**:\n   - The table confirms that Cole made 18 field goals out of 50 attempts, which matches the claim.\n\n2. **Field Goal Percentage**:\n   - The table lists a percentage of 360, which is incorrect as it exceeds the maximum possible value of 100%.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim about the number of field goals made and attempted is correct, but the percentage provided in the claim (360) is not valid. Therefore, the overall claim is false.\n\nHere's the JSON response with relevant cells identified:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"field goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to check if Cole's field goal statistics in the table match \"18 - 50 360.\" Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how this verification can be done:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information**: The relevant information for verifying the claim is contained within the row corresponding to the player named \"Cole\" and specifically in the column labeled \"field goals.\"\n\n2. **Locate Cole's Row**: By examining the data provided, we find that \"Cole\" corresponds to the 9th entry (index 8 when zero-indexed) in the list of players.\n\n3. **Access Field Goals Data for Cole**: In the table, each player's field goal statistics are formatted as \"made - attempted - percentage.\" For \"Cole,\" this data is located at `data[8][1]`, which corresponds to \"18 - 50 360.\"\n\n4. **Compare with Claim**: The claim states that \"cole have 18 - 50 360 field goal.\" Upon inspection, the data matches exactly.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the field goal statistics for Cole in the table are indeed \"18 - 50 360,\" the claim is supported by the information provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE is \"TRUE.\"\n\nHere's the JSON object with the relevant cell details:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"field goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
