    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding IPATINGA's performance in 38 games, we need to verify two specific conditions from the provided table:\n\n1. **Condition 1:** \"IPATINGA have lost more than 14 games.\"\n2. **Condition 2:** \"IPATINGA drew 8 games.\"\n\nThe table is structured with columns: `position`, `team`, `points`, `played`, `drawn`, `lost`, `against`, and `difference`. We will focus on the relevant column data for IPATINGA to assess these conditions:\n\n- The row corresponding to IPATINGA in this table can be identified by checking where \"ipatinga\" appears under the \"team\" column, which is at index 19.\n  \nFor Condition 1:\n- Check the value in the `lost` column at row index 19. According to the data, IPATINGA lost 21 games.\n\nSince 21 is indeed more than 14, this condition holds true.\n\nFor Condition 2:\n- Check the value in the `drawn` column at row index 19. According to the data, IPATINGA drew 8 games.\n\nThe number of drawn games being exactly 8 matches the claim precisely.\n\nBoth conditions specified in the claim are supported by the table's data for IPATINGA. Hence, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, let\u2019s outline the relevant cells used to verify this:\n\n- For Condition 1 (\"lost more than 14 games\"), we looked at row index 19 in the `lost` column.\n- For Condition 2 (\"drew 8 games\"), we checked row index 19 in the `drawn` column.\n\nThe following JSON object summarizes these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine two specific conditions within the data provided in the table: \n\n1. The team named \"sport\" must have 52 points.\n2. The same team, \"sport,\" must also have a difference of 3.\n\nFirstly, let's identify which row contains information about the team \"sport.\" Looking at the data:\n\n- We see that the team \"sport\" is listed in the 11th row (index starts from 0).\n\nNow, we need to verify the relevant details for this team:\n\n1. **Points**: Check if the points column of the 11th row matches the claim.\n   - In the table: The value at position `[11][2]` (row index 11, column \"points\") is `52`.\n\n2. **Difference**: Check if the difference column of the 11th row matches the claim.\n   - In the table: The value at position `[11][7]` (row index 11, column \"difference\") is `\"3\"`.\n\nBoth conditions stated in the claim are satisfied by the data in the specified row. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n- Row index 11 and column name \"points.\"\n- Row index 11 and column name \"difference.\"\n\nHere's the JSON representation of the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim against the provided table, we must verify each part of the statement:\n\n1. **Team Name**: The claim refers to a team called \"ipitanga,\" but according to the table, there is no such team; instead, there's \"ipatinga.\" This discrepancy indicates an issue with the claim.\n\n2. **Points**: The claim states that \"ipitanga\" has 75 points. According to the table, \"s\u00e3o paulo\" has 75 points (row index 0), and \"ipatinga\" has only 35 points (row index 19).\n\n3. **Less than 30 Games Played**: The team in question is said to have played less than 30 games. In the table, all teams played 38 games.\n\n4. **Number of Lost Matches**: The claim mentions that this team lost 17 matches. From the data, \"ipatinga\" lost 21 matches (row index 19), and no team with exactly 17 losses is recorded in less than 30 games as per the table data.\n\nGiven these observations:\n- There's a discrepancy in the team name.\n- No team meets all conditions: having 75 points, playing fewer than 30 games, and losing 17 matches. \n- \"ipatinga\" (the closest resembling name) does not match any part of the claim accurately.\n\nThus, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells from the table to verify these aspects are:\n- Points column for \"ipatinga\" at row index 19.\n- Played column for all teams at row index 0 (first row as a sample since all teams have the same value).\n- Lost column for \"ipatinga\" at row index 19.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
