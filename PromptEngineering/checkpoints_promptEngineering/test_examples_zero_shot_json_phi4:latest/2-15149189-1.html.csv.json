    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify two conditions from the given table:\n\n1. The player with the date of birth on \"2 November 1987\" should be in the position of \"fly-half\".\n2. There should not be another fly-half playing for Sale.\n\nLet's evaluate these points using the provided JSON data:\n\n### Condition 1: Position Verification\n- We need to find the player born on \"2 November 1987\". Scanning through the data:\n  - Row index 44 matches with date of birth as \"2 november 1987\".\n  - This row contains the player \"danny cipriani\" and position as \"fly-half\".\n\nThis confirms that the first condition is satisfied.\n\n### Condition 2: Sale Fly-Half Verification\n- We need to check if there are any other players listed with position \"fly-half\" who play for Sale.\n- Reviewing all rows:\n  - Row index 44 contains \"danny cipriani\", club/province \"wasps\".\n  - Row index 26 contains the player \"charlie hodgson\", who is a \"fly-half\" and plays for \"sale\".\n\nThis shows that there is another fly-half (Charlie Hodgson) playing for Sale, contradicting the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. Now let's identify the relevant cells:\n\n- Row index 44: This row provides the information about Danny Cipriani being a fly-half born on 2 November 1987.\n- Row index 26: This row confirms Charlie Hodgson as a fly-half from Sale.\n\nThe columns involved are \"date of birth (age)\", \"position\", and \"club / province\".\n\nHere's the JSON output summarizing our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 44, \"column_name\": \"date of birth (age)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 44, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 44, \"column_name\": \"club / province\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"club / province\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down each part of the claim and check it against the data from the table:\n\n1. **Player Name - \"Steve Borthwick\":**  \n   First, identify if Steve Borthwick exists in the list. From the data, we find that there is a player named Steve Borthwick.\n\n2. **Position - \"prop\":**  \n   Check whether Steve Borthwick's position is listed as \"prop\". According to the data:\n   ```\n   [\n     \"steve borthwick\",\n     \"lock\", // Steve Borthwick's position\n     ...\n   ]\n   ```\n   Steve Borthwick plays at the position of \"lock,\" not \"prop.\"\n\n3. **Club - \"Leicester\":**  \n   Check if Steve Borthwick is associated with Leicester. According to the data:\n   ```\n   [\n     \"steve borthwick\",\n     \"lock\",\n     ...,\n     \"bath\" // Steve Borthwick's club\n   ]\n   ```\n   Steve Borthwick plays for Bath, not Leicester.\n\n4. **Claim - \"Steve Borthwick be Leicester's best known player in that position\":**  \n   The claim suggests that he is the most recognized player from Leicester playing as a prop. However:\n   - Steve Borthwick is neither a prop nor associated with Leicester.\n   - Therefore, there are no grounds to evaluate whether he is Leicester\u2019s best-known player at any position.\n\nGiven these observations, the relevant parts of the table for checking this claim include:\n\n- The entry for \"Steve Borthwick\" indicating his actual position and club.\n  \nThe relevant cells from the table:\n- For Steve Borthwick: Row 8 (index 7 in zero-based indexing), columns \"player\", \"position\", and \"club / province\".\n\nSince the claim does not hold true based on the data provided, we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"club / province\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
