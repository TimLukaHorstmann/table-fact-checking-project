    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim about the first place tie in the golf tournament table provided, we need to verify two aspects: the players involved in the tie for the first place and their ranking.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Identify First Place Tie**: According to the table data:\n   - \"ernie els\", \"colin montgomerie\", and \"loren roberts\" are all tied for 1st place (indicated by \"t1\") with scores of 279 and a money ranking indicating they went into a playoff. This is relevant because it shows who actually shares the first-place tie.\n   - Their scores: \n     - Ernie Els: \\(69 + 71 + 66 + 73 = 279\\)\n     - Colin Montgomerie: \\(71 + 65 + 73 + 70 = 279\\)\n     - Loren Roberts: \\(76 + 69 + 64 + 70 = 279\\)\n\n2. **Check Claimed Players**: The claim states that the first place tie is between \"duffy waldorf\", \"jeff sluman\", and \"frank nobilo\".\n   - According to the table:\n     - \"Duffy Waldorf\", \"Jeff Sluman\", and \"Frank Nobilo\" are tied for 9th place (indicated by \"t9\") with scores of 284. This confirms they are not in a first-place tie.\n\n3. **Relevant Cells**: Based on this analysis, the relevant rows and columns needed to verify the claim include:\n   - Row indices where the players mentioned in the claim are listed: Duffy Waldorf (row index 11), Jeff Sluman (row index 10), Frank Nobilo (row index 9).\n   - The \"place\" column for these players to confirm their actual ranking.\n   - The row indices where the actual first-place tie occurs, which is with Ernie Els, Colin Montgomerie, and Loren Roberts: Row indices 0, 1, and 2.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The claim is false because Duffy Waldorf, Jeff Sluman, and Frank Nobilo are tied for 9th place, not first. The actual tie for the first place is between Ernie Els, Colin Montgomerie, and Loren Roberts.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
