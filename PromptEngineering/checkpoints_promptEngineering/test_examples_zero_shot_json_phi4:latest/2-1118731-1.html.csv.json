    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the power of the 1972 engine, we need to focus on finding entries related to the year 1972 in the provided table and examining the \"power\" column for those entries.\n\nThe relevant steps to verify the claim are as follows:\n\n1. **Locate Entries for Year 1972**: We'll look through each entry's \"years\" field to identify any that include the year 1972.\n\n2. **Check Power Value for These Entries**: For each identified entry, examine the value in the \"power\" column to determine if it is provided or marked as \"-\".\n\n3. **Verify Across All Relevant Entries**: Ensure that all relevant entries for 1972 show no power value (indicated by \"-\").\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n- Look through the data:\n  - Entry 0: Year \"1971\" \u2013 Not relevant to 1972.\n  - Entry 1: Years \"1971 - 1973\" \u2013 Relevant as it includes 1972.\n  - Entry 2: Year \"1972\" \u2013 Directly relevant.\n  - Other entries are for years outside of 1972.\n\n- For the relevant entries:\n  - **Entry 1**: Power is \"-\".\n  - **Entry 2**: Power is \"-\".\n\nBoth relevant entries (1 and 2) show that power is not given, supporting the claim that \"the power of the 1972 engine be not give in hp (kw).\"\n\nThus, we conclude that the claim is true based on the data provided.\n\nThe JSON output reflecting this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"power\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"power\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
