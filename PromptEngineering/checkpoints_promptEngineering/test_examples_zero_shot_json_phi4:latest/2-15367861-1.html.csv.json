The number of losses (\"lost\") for Corinthians should be less than 11.\n2. The points accrued by Corinthians should equal 22.\n\nLet's examine the row corresponding to \"corinthians\" in the provided JSON data:\n\n- **Row Index**: From scanning the table, \"corinthians\" is found at index 5 (since indices start from 0).\n\nRelevant columns for this claim are:\n- \"points\"\n- \"lost\"\n\nNow, we will check these conditions against the values for Corinthians:\n\n1. **Points**: The points column for Corinthians shows a value of 22.\n2. **Lost**: The lost column for Corinthians shows a value of 10.\n\nThe claim states that Corinthians have amassed 22 points and received fewer than 11 losses. Based on our examination:\n- They indeed have 22 points (matching the condition).\n- They have 10 losses, which is less than 11 (also matching the condition).\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data provided in the table.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is \"TRUE\". The relevant cells for verifying this claim from the JSON data are:\n- Points column at row index 5.\n- Lost column at row index 5.\n\nHere's the response in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table data for the team \"corinthians.\" The claim states: \"there be zero loss that corinthians received when they score over 25 points.\"\n\nFirst, let's identify the row corresponding to \"corinthians\" in the data:\n\n- From the given JSON, the team \"corinthians\" is listed in row index 5:\n  ```json\n  [\n    6,\n    \"corinthians\",\n    22,\n    22,\n    2,\n    10,\n    51,\n    \"-20\"\n  ]\n  ```\n\nNext, let's break down the relevant parts of this data:\n\n1. **Points Scored (Goals For)**: This is represented by the column \"against\" since it shows the number of goals scored against them. However, for clarity and consistency with common sports terminology, we assume the context here refers to the team's own scoring capability when looking at \"goals for\" (which isn't explicitly listed but can be inferred from a broader understanding that this is likely intended to mean goals they've scored rather than conceded).\n\n2. **Losses**: The number of losses is in the column labeled \"lost.\"\n\n3. **Goals For (Assumed)**: Since there's no explicit \"goals for\" column, we'll infer from context and common sports tables structure that \"against\" here shows their own goals. However, to verify if they scored over 25 points, we need a separate inferred \"goals for\" which isn't directly provided.\n\nThe claim involves checking if corinthians ever had zero losses when scoring more than 25 points. We must determine:\n\n- If the number of games where they lost is zero (i.e., `lost` column equals 0) while their goals scored in those games were over 25.\n  \nFrom the data:\n- \"corinthians\" have a total of 10 losses (`lost = 10`).\n- Their goals for are inferred from context or possibly a mislabeling, but they scored 51 goals as indicated in the \"against\" column.\n\nGiven that corinthians have 10 losses and assuming no other data explicitly states goals scored per game (which would be needed to verify zero-loss games with over 25 points), we cannot conclude that there were any zero-loss instances when scoring more than 25 points.\n\nTherefore, based on available data:\n- There is no record of a zero-loss situation for corinthians.\n- We lack explicit per-game score data beyond the total goals scored and conceded.\n\nThus, the claim \"there be zero loss that corinthians received when they score over 25 point\" cannot be verified as true with the provided data. The answer must therefore be \"FALSE.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
