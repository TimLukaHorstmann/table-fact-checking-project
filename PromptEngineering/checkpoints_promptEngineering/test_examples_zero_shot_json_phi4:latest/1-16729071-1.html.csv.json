Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells to verify this:\n\n- For `week` = 15: This corresponds to row index 14 (since indexing starts at 0).\n- For \"game site\" being \"kingdome\": This is also in row index 14.\n- For \"attendance\" being 60038: Again, found in row index 14.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
