    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"black - out be on on the same channel at 9:30 and then 10:00,\" we need to analyze the table provided in JSON format.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Identify Columns**:\n   The columns represent times in half-hour increments starting from 7:00 to 10:30.\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Rows**:\n   We are interested in the row where \"black - out\" appears at both 9:30 and 10:00.\n\n3. **Examine Each Row for 'black - out'**:\n   - **Row Index 4**: \n     - At 9:30, the entry is \"les machos.\"\n     - At 10:00, the entry is \"news.\"\n   - **Row Index 5**: \n     - At 9:30, the entry is \"black - out.\"\n     - At 10:00, the entry is \"fin du monde.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   In Row Index 5, \"black - out\" appears at 9:30 and a different program (\"fin du monde\") appears at 10:00. Therefore, it does not appear on the same channel at both times.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n\n- **Row Index 5, Column '9:30'**: Contains \"black - out.\"\n- **Row Index 5, Column '10:00'**: Contains \"fin du monde.\"\n\nSince \"black - out\" does not appear at both times in the same row, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"9:30\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"10:00\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
