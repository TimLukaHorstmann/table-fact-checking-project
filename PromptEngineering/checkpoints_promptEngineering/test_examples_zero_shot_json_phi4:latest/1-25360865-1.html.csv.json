    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"the height for jamychal green be less than 6 foot\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify Jamychal Green's height from the provided table.\n\n1. **Locate Jamychal Green in the Table:**\n   - We search through the data rows to find an entry with the name \"jamychal green\".\n   - The relevant row index for \"jamychal green\" is 10 (0-based indexing).\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Information:**\n   - In this row, we need to check the \"height\" column.\n   - According to the table, Jamychal Green's height is listed as \"6 - 9\".\n\n3. **Interpret Height Measurement:**\n   - The notation \"6 - 9\" means that Jamychal Green is 6 feet and 9 inches tall.\n   - To determine if this is less than 6 feet, we consider the entire measurement:\n     - 6 feet = 72 inches\n     - Therefore, 6 feet 9 inches = 81 inches\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - Since 81 inches is greater than 72 inches (6 feet), Jamychal Green's height is not less than 6 feet.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is FALSE because Jamychal Green's height of \"6 - 9\" is greater than 6 feet.\n\nThe relevant cell to verify this claim is:\n- Row index: 10\n- Column name: \"height\"\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"height\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
