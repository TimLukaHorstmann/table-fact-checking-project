The claim specifies that Malcolm Brown and Peter Hart have the highest number of league appearances.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column**: We are interested in the \"league apps\" column because it directly relates to the claim about league appearances.\n\n2. **Extract data from the \"league apps\" column**:\n   - Jim Branagan: 0\n   - Malcolm Brown: 46\n   - David Cowling: 39 (1)\n   - Peter Fletcher: 30 (8)\n   - Keith Hanvey: 33\n   - Peter Hart: 46\n   - Ian Holmes: 6 (4)\n   - Steve Kindon: 22 (1)\n   - Mick Laverick: 45\n   - Bernard Purdie: 18 (4)\n   - Andy Rankin: 24\n   - Ian Robins: 45\n   - Fred Robinson: 30\n   - Tommy Smith: 0\n   - Brian Stanton: 41\n   - Alan Starling: 22\n   - Dave Sutton: 46\n   - Chris Topping: 13\n\n3. **Determine the highest values**:\n   - The players with the highest league apps are Malcolm Brown, Peter Hart, and Dave Sutton, each having \"46\".\n\n4. **Evaluate the claim**: \n   - The claim states that the two players with the highest league apps are Malcolm Brown and Peter Hart.\n   - While they do have one of the highest values (46), there is another player, Dave Sutton, who also has 46 league apps.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since Dave Sutton also shares the highest number of league appearances with Malcolm Brown and Peter Hart, the claim that only these two players have the highest league apps is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to the claim is \"FALSE\".\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"league apps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"league apps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"league apps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
