We need to find this date in the table.\n\n- The entire dataset is for matches that occurred on \"7 may 1960\". So, all rows are relevant for the date condition.\n\n#### Step 2: Identify the Match with Richmond as Away Team\nWe need to identify which match has \"richmond\" as the away team.\n\n- Row 0: \n  - Home team: north melbourne\n  - Away team: richmond\n\nRichmond is indeed listed as the away team in row 0.\n\n#### Step 3: Verify the Crowd Size\nThe claim states that the crowd size was 9000.\n\n- In row 0, the \"crowd\" column shows a value of 9000.\n\n#### Step 4: Confirm Richmond's Score\nThe claim specifies Richmond's score as \"3.8 (26)\".\n\n- In row 0, the \"away team score\" is listed as \"3.8 (26)\", which matches the claimed score for Richmond.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll conditions of the claim are satisfied by row 0 in the table:\n\n1. The date matches.\n2. Richmond is the away team.\n3. The crowd size is 9000.\n4. Richmond's score is 3.8 (26).\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row index: 0\n- Columns: \"date\", \"crowd\", \"away team\", \"away team score\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table data and compare it with the conditions specified in the claim.\n\n### Claim Analysis\n\nThe claim states: \"3.8 (26) be the away team score against a home team that score 5.12 (42).\"\n\nWe will break this down into two main parts:\n1. The home team scores 5.12 (42).\n2. The corresponding away team scores 3.8 (26).\n\n### Table Analysis\n\nWe have a table with multiple rows and columns, where each row represents a game. Let's identify which cells are relevant to verify the claim:\n\n- **Home Team Score**: \"home team score\"\n- **Away Team Score**: \"away team score\"\n\nNow, let's go through each row of data in the table to find where these conditions are met.\n\n#### Row-by-Row Examination\n\n1. **Row 0**:\n   - Home Team: north melbourne\n   - Home Team Score: 5.12 (42)\n   - Away Team: richmond\n   - Away Team Score: 3.8 (26)\n\n   This row satisfies both conditions specified in the claim:\n   - The home team score is \"5.12 (42)\".\n   - The away team score is \"3.8 (26)\".\n\nSince we have found a match for the condition, we can conclude that the claim is true. We only need to verify one instance where these conditions are met; therefore, further examination of other rows isn't necessary unless needed for additional validation.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nFor the row where the claim holds true, the relevant cells are:\n- Row index: 0\n- Column \"home team score\"\n- Column \"away team score\"\n\nThus, the JSON response is constructed as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
