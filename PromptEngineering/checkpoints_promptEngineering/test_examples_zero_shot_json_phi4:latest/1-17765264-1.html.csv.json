We will break this down into two main conditions:\n   - The record must be \"4 - 4\".\n   - The attendance must be 14,489.\n\n3. Let's check each row in the data to see if these conditions are met simultaneously:\n\n   - **Row 1**: \n     - Record: \"1 - 0\", Attendance: 21,597\n     - Not matching either condition.\n   \n   - **Row 2**:\n     - Record: \"2 - 0\", Attendance: 15,229\n     - Not matching either condition.\n     \n   - **Row 3**: \n     - Record: \"2 - 1\", Attendance: 20,462\n     - Not matching either condition.\n   \n   - **Row 4**:\n     - Record: \"3 - 1\", Attendance: 18,372\n     - Not matching either condition.\n     \n   - **Row 5**: \n     - Missing data for week 5 (presumed).\n     \n   - **Row 6**: \n     - Record: \"3 - 2\", Attendance: 19,141\n     - Not matching either condition.\n   \n   - **Row 7**:\n     - Record: \"4 - 2\", Attendance: 12,683\n     - Not matching either condition.\n     \n   - **Row 8**: \n     - Record: \"4 - 3\", Attendance: 13,002\n     - Not matching either condition.\n   \n   - **Row 9**:\n     - Record: \"4 - 4\", Attendance: 14,489\n     - Both conditions are met here.\n\n   - **Row 10**: \n     - Record: \"4 - 5\", Attendance: 21,000\n     - Does not match the record condition.\n   \n   - **Row 11**:\n     - Record: \"4 - 6\", Attendance: 20,778\n     - Does not match either condition.\n     \n   - **Row 12**: \n     - Record: \"4 - 6 - 1\", Attendance: 7,785\n     - Does not match the record condition.\n   \n   - **Row 13**:\n     - Record: \"4 - 7 - 1\", Attendance: 5,861\n     - Does not match either condition.\n     \n   - **Row 14**: \n     - Record: \"4 - 8 - 1\", Attendance: 9,928\n     - Does not match the record condition.\n\nFrom this examination, we find that only in **Row 9** does both the conditions of having a record of \"4 - 4\" and an attendance of 14,489 hold true simultaneously. \n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data, making it TRUE.\n\nHere's the final JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
