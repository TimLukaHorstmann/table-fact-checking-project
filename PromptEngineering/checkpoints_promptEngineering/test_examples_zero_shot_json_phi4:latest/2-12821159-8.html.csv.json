    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down the claim and verify it against the provided table.\n\n### Claim:\n\"Runner-up, Rick Huiskamp's margin of victory be 10 stroke.\"\n\nThis claim can be broken into two parts for verification:\n\n1. **Runner-Up Verification:**\n   - The claim states that Rick Huiskamp is the runner-up.\n   - We need to find an entry in the table where the \"runner-up\" column contains \"rick huiskamp\".\n\n2. **Margin of Victory Verification:**\n   - The claim states that the margin of victory for Rick Huiskamp's tournament was 10 strokes.\n   - For the same row identified above, we need to check if the \"margin of victory\" is indeed \"10 strokes\".\n\n### Checking the Table:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the Row with Rick Huiskamp as Runner-Up\n\n- Scan through each row in the data:\n  - **Row Index 0:** \"runner-up\" is \"wolfgang huget\"\n  - **Row Index 1:** \"runner-up\" is \"mark grabow schytter\"\n  - **Row Index 2:** \"runner-up\" is \"rick huiskamp\"\n  - **Row Index 3:** \"runner-up\" is \"lasse jensen\"\n  - **Row Index 4:** \"runner-up\" is \"richard treis\"\n  - **Row Index 5:** \"runner-up\" is \"christoph g\u00fcnther\"\n\nRick Huiskamp appears as the runner-up in **Row Index 2**.\n\n#### Step 2: Verify the Margin of Victory for Row Index 2\n\n- Check the \"margin of victory\" column for Row Index 2:\n  - It states \"10 strokes\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied:\n- Rick Huiskamp is indeed listed as the runner-up in Row Index 2.\n- The margin of victory for that tournament is exactly 10 strokes.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells to verify this claim are from Row Index 2, specifically the \"runner-up\" and \"margin of victory\" columns.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding Rick Huiskamp, we need to verify two key conditions mentioned in the claim:\n\n1. Rick Huiskamp was a runner-up.\n2. The margin of victory for the tournament where Rick Huiskamp was the runner-up is a single-digit number.\n\nLet's evaluate these against the table data provided:\n\n### Step 1: Identify if Rick Huiskamp was a Runner-Up\n\nWe will look through the \"runner - up\" column in each row to find any instance of Rick Huiskamp.\n\n- **Row 0**: The runner-up is Wolfgang huget.\n- **Row 1**: The runner-up is mark grabow schytter.\n- **Row 2**: The runner-up is Rick huiskamp. (This satisfies the first condition.)\n- **Row 3**: The runner-up is lasse jensen.\n- **Row 4**: The runner-up is richard treis.\n- **Row 5**: The runner-up is christoph g\u00fcnther.\n\nRick Huiskamp is indeed listed as a runner-up in row 2.\n\n### Step 2: Check the Margin of Victory\n\nNow, we need to check the margin of victory for the tournament where Rick Huiskamp was a runner-up (row 2).\n\n- **Row 2**: The \"margin of victory\" is 10 strokes.\n\nThe claim states that the margin should be a single-digit number. However, in this case, it is 10, which is not a single-digit number.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the second condition is not met (the margin of victory is not a single-digit number), the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n\n- Row 2, \"runner - up\"\n- Row 2, \"margin of victory\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
