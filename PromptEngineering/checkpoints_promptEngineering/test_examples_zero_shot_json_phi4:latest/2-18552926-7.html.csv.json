Specifically, we will look at rows where she is listed under \"recipients and nominees\" and check if the result is \"nominated.\"\n\nLet's go through the relevant rows:\n\n1. **Row Index 2**: \n   - Year: 1995\n   - Category: best actress in a leading role - drama series\n   - Recipients and Nominees: Gillian Anderson\n   - Result: nominated\n\n2. **Row Index 5**:\n   - Year: 1996\n   - Category: best actress in leading role - drama series\n   - Recipients and Nominees: Gillian Anderson\n   - Result: won (This does not count as a nomination)\n\n3. **Row Index 7**:\n   - Year: 1997\n   - Category: best actress in leading role - drama series\n   - Recipients and Nominees: Gillian Anderson\n   - Result: nominated\n\n4. **Row Index 10**:\n   - Year: 1998\n   - Category: best actress in leading role - drama series\n   - Recipients and Nominees: Gillian Anderson\n   - Result: nominated\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that Gillian Anderson was nominated for an award in rows 2, 7, and 10.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"David Duchovny was nominated for best actor in leading role - drama series every other year\" is true or false, we need to analyze the data related to David Duchovny's nominations from 1994 through 1998.\n\nThe relevant column for this task involves checking entries under the category \"best actor in leading role - drama series,\" specifically noting when David Duchovny was nominated. Here's how we proceed:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We need to focus on rows where the category is \"best actor in leading role - drama series\" and see if David Duchovny was nominated.\n   \n2. **Examine Each Relevant Entry:**\n   - For each year from 1994 to 1998, we check whether there's a nomination for David Duchovny.\n\n3. **Check Nominations and the \"Every Other Year\" Pattern:**\n   - According to the claim, nominations should occur in alternate years.\n   - Specifically, if he is nominated one year, he should not be nominated the next, then be nominated again, and so on.\n\n4. **Data Analysis:**\n\n   - 1995:\n     - Category: \"best actor in leading role - drama series\"\n     - Recipient/Nominee: David Duchovny\n     - Result: Nominated\n     - Relevant row index: 1\n\n   - 1996:\n     - Category: \"best actor in leading role - drama series\"\n     - Recipient/Nominee: David Duchovny\n     - Result: Won (implies a nomination, as one must be nominated to win)\n     - Relevant row index: 3\n\n   - 1997:\n     - Category: \"best actor in leading role - drama series\"\n     - Recipient/Nominee: David Duchovny\n     - Result: Nominated\n     - Relevant row index: 6\n\n   - 1998:\n     - Category: \"best actor in leading role - drama series\"\n     - Recipient/Nominee: David Duchovny\n     - Result: Nominated\n     - Relevant row index: 9\n\n5. **Determine Pattern:**\n   - Based on the data:\n     - Nominated in 1995, Won in 1996 (nominated), Nominated again in 1997 and 1998.\n   - The pattern does not fit \"every other year\" since he was nominated consecutively from 1995 to 1998.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false because David Duchovny was nominated in consecutive years starting from 1995 through 1998, which does not align with being nominated every other year.
