    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table and check if there is a game where the team suffered their worst loss by a margin of 23 points against the Washington Redskins.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim states that the team's worst loss was by 23 points in a game where they were defeated by the Washington Redskins with a score of 40-17.\n\n2. **Checking Relevant Data**:\n   - We need to find games where the team lost (indicated by \"l\" in the \"result\" column).\n   - Calculate the margin of loss for each losing game.\n   - Identify if any loss was exactly 23 points.\n   - Verify if there is a game against the Washington Redskins with a score of 40-17.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Table**:\n   - Look through the \"data\" array in the table to find entries where the \"result\" column starts with \"l\" (indicating a loss).\n   - Calculate the margin for each losing game by subtracting the team's score from the opponent's score.\n   - Check if any of these losses match a 23-point difference.\n\n4. **Finding the Relevant Game**:\n   - The row where \"opponent\" is \"washington redskins\" and \"result\" is \"l 40 - 17\" needs to be identified.\n   - Verify the margin: 40 (Redskins) - 17 (team) = 23 points.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The game against the Washington Redskins on December 7, 1980, with a result of \"l 40 - 17\", is indeed a loss by 23 points.\n   - This matches the claim perfectly.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - Identify the row index and relevant columns for this entry: \n     - Row index: 13\n     - Columns: \"opponent\" (value: \"washington redskins\"), \"result\" (value: \"l 40 - 17\")\n\nBased on the analysis, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The smallest attendance recorded for a game.\n2.
