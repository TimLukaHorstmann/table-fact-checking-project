    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"the opponent that played on March 28 was the Colorado Rockies\" is true or false, we need to verify two conditions from the table: \n1. The date (March) when the game was played.\n2. The opponent for that specific date.\n\nFirstly, identify the row in which the column `march` contains the value `28`. This corresponds to finding the entry where the \"game\" number is 74, as per the provided data.\n\nNext, verify the opponent listed in this row:\n- For game 74, check the `opponent` column to see if it states \"colorado rockies\".\n\nNow let's examine the relevant portion of the table:\n\n```json\n[\n    [\n        74,\n        28,\n        \"colorado rockies\",\n        \"3 - 4\",\n        \"42 - 19 - 13\",\n        97\n    ]\n]\n```\n\nFrom this row, we can confirm:\n- The `march` value is indeed `28`.\n- The opponent listed is `\"colorado rockies\"`.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied\u2014March 28 corresponds to a game against the Colorado Rockies\u2014the claim is supported by the table data.\n\nThus, the JSON response would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"march\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote that the row index is adjusted to zero-based indexing, so game number 74 corresponds to `row_index` 13.",
