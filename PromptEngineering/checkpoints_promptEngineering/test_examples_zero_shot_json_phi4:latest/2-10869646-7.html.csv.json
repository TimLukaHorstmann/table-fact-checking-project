We'll calculate the total score (home + away) for each row.\n\n**Calculations:**\n1. Geelong vs North Melbourne: 59 + 90 = 149\n2. Essendon vs Richmond: 105 + 115 = 220 (Venue: Windy Hill)\n3. South Melbourne vs Melbourne: 94 + 76 = 170\n4. St Kilda vs Collingwood: 82 + 88 = 170\n5. Hawthorn vs Carlton: 100 + 60 = 160\n6. Footscray vs Fitzroy: 87 + 60 = 147\n\n- The highest total score is 220, which occurred at \"Windy Hill\".\n\n### Part 2: Occurrence in June 1974\n- According to the table, all matches listed are on \"18 May 1974\".\n- Therefore, no match (including the one with the highest points) occurred in June 1974.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- While Windy Hill was indeed the venue for the most points scored in this subset of data, it did not occur in June 1974.
