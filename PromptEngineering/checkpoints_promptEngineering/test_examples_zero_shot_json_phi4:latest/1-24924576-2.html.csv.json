The table provides results in various formats, such as \"ko\", \"tko\", or \"sd\" (split decision), where a numerical score is given.\n\n2. **Extract Scores**:\n   - Against Ricky Hatton: Result is \"ko 2 / 12\". Since it's a knockout at round 2, the scores from judges are not applicable here.\n   - Against Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez: Result is \"sd 12 / 12\". This indicates a split decision. We need to check the exact scorecard for this bout to determine the difference in points.\n   - Other fights (e.g., against David D\u00edaz, Marco Antonio Barrera) also have scores given as \"tko\" or similar, but we focus on those with explicit scoring.\n\n3. **Analyze Scores**:\n   - For split decisions like against M\u00e1rquez, the score typically shows a difference between the judges' scores. However, without specific numerical values for each judge's score in this table, we cannot directly compare.\n   - In boxing, a \"ko\" or \"tko\" result means one fighter won outright before all rounds were completed, so no scoring points are compared.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the bout with Ricky Hatton ended in a knockout (ko), there is no final scoring point difference to compare.\n   - The only fight listed with a split decision is against Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez (\"sd 12 / 12\"), which implies there was a difference in judges' scores.

However, it is implied to be the only one with a score difference, thus making the claim false as stated.",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Manny Pacquiao won the most bouts in 2001\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to analyze the relevant data.\n\n### Analyzing the Data:\n\nThe table contains several columns:\n- **number**: Not directly relevant for counting wins by year.\n- **name**: Indicates the boxer's name.\n- **titles**: Lists titles associated with each fight.\n- **date**: The date of the fight.\n- **opponent**: The opponent in the fight.\n- **result**: The result of the fight (e.g., \"ko\", \"tko\", \"sd\").\n- **defenses**: Number of title defenses, not directly relevant for counting wins by year.\n\n### Steps to Verify the Claim:\n\n1. **Identify Fights in 2001**:\n   - We need to find rows where the date indicates a fight occurred in 2001.\n   - The date format is \"YYYY-MM-DD\".\n\n2. **Count Wins in 2001**:\n   - For each identified fight, check if the result indicates a win (e.g., \"ko\", \"tko\", or \"sd\" with Pacquiao as the winner).\n\n3. **Compare with Other Years**:\n   - Count wins for other years to see if 2001 had the most.\n\n### Relevant Rows:\n\n- **Row 2**: \n  - Date: \"2001-06-23\"\n  - Result: \"tko 6 / 12\" (indicating a win)\n  \nThis is the only fight in 2001 listed in the table, and it was a win for Manny Pacquiao.\n\n### Comparison with Other Years:\n\n- **1998**:\n  - Rows 0 and 1 both indicate wins on \"1998-12-04\".\n\n- **2003**:\n  - Row 3 indicates a win on \"2003-11-15\".\n\n- **2008**:\n  - Rows 4, 5, and 6 indicate wins on \"2008-03-15\" and \"2008-06-28\".\n\n- **2009**:\n  - Row 7 indicates a win on \"2009-05-02\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nManny Pacquiao won multiple bouts in other years (1998, 2003, 2008, and 2009) compared to just one bout in 2001. Therefore, the claim that he won the most bouts in 2001 is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are those indicating the date and result of the fight in 2001.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding Manny Pacquiao's bout with Marco Antonio Barrera having the biggest difference in score points, we need to focus on the \"result\" column from the table. This column provides information about the outcomes of each fight and includes score details where applicable.\n\nHere are the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Fights**: We are interested in comparing all fights listed to see which has the largest difference in score points. Specifically, we need to focus on the bout with Marco Antonio Barrera.\n\n2. **Extract Score Details**:\n   - For each fight, extract and interpret the result scores where they are available.\n   - The relevant entries for the results are as follows:\n     - Manny Pacquiao vs. Chatchai Sasakul: \"ko 8 / 12\" (Not a scored decision)\n     - Manny Pacquiao vs. Lehlohonolo Ledwaba: \"tko 6 / 12\" (Not a scored decision)\n     - **Manny Pacquiao vs. Marco Antonio Barrera**: \"tko 11 / 12\" (Not a scored decision)\n     - Manny Pacquiao vs. Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez: \"sd 12 / 12\"\n     - Manny Pacquiao vs. David D\u00edaz: \"tko 9 / 12\" (Not a scored decision)\n     - Manny Pacquiao vs. Ricky Hatton: \"ko 2 / 12\" (Not a scored decision)\n\n3. **Calculate Score Differences**:\n   - For fights with \"sd\" (split decision), calculate the score difference.\n   - Manny Pacquiao vs. Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez: The result is \"sd 12 / 12\". A typical split decision might have scores like 115-113, 112-116, and 114-114. The maximum possible difference in this scenario would be 3 points.\n\n4. **Compare Score Differences**:\n   - Since the fight with Marco Antonio Barrera ended in a technical knockout (\"tko\"), there is no score point difference to compare.\n   - The only fight with a scored decision is against Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez, where the maximum possible score difference is 3 points.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states that Manny Pacquiao's bout with Marco Antonio Barrera had the biggest difference in score points. However, there was no score point difference as it ended in a technical knockout.\n   - Therefore, the fight with Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez, which had a scored decision, has the largest possible score point difference.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells are those related to the results of the fights, specifically the bout with Marco Antonio Barrera and the one with Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
