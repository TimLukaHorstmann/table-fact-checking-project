    "resp": "To verify the claim that \"Paddock's last appearance be in Blood is Thicker than Water, and red squirrel's last appearance be in A Hero's Welcome,\" we need to examine the relevant cells from the provided table for both Paddock and Red Squirrels.\n\n1. **For Paddock:**\n   - We must find all appearances of Paddock within the \"TV Show\" column.\n   - Then verify if \"Blood is Thicker than Water\" is indeed his last appearance listed.\n\n2. **For Red Squirrels:**\n   - Similarly, we need to identify all instances where Red Squirrels appear in the \"TV Show\" column.\n   - Check if \"A Hero's Welcome\" is their final mentioned appearance.\n\nLet's proceed with extracting this information from the table:\n\n- **Paddock:** \n  - The appearances are listed as \"Blood is Thicker than Water (2x12)\" and \"Heart is Where the Heart Is (2x06).\" According to these entries, his last appearance is \"Blood is Thicker than Water.\"\n\n- **Red Squirrels:**\n  - They appear only once in the table under \"A Hero's Welcome (2x01),\" which matches their last known appearance.\n\nBased on this examination:\n\n- Paddock's last TV show appearance is indeed \"Blood is Thicker than Water.\"\n- Red Squirrels' sole and therefore last appearance is \"A Hero's Welcome.\"\n\nTherefore, both conditions in the claim are satisfied. The answer to the claim is TRUE. Let's identify the relevant cells for verification.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\nFor Paddock:\n- Row index 8 (Paddock): TV Show - Blood is thicker then water (2x12)\n- Row index 8 (Paddock): TV Show - Heart is where the heart is (2x06)\n\nFor Red Squirrels:\n- Row index 13 (Red squirrels): TV Show - A hero 's welcome (2x01)\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"TV Show\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"TV Show\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"TV Show\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the male bounder book be no\" is supported by the data in the table:\n\n1. **Identify Key Components of the Claim:**\n   - The claim mentions \"male,\" which corresponds to the \"Gender\" column.\n   - It also refers to \"bounder,\" which can be matched with a name in the \"Name\" column.\n   - Finally, it states that something is \"no.\" This could relate to either the \"Book\" or \"TV show\" columns.\n\n2. **Locate 'Bounder' in the Table:**\n   - Search for entries where \"Name\" equals \"bounder.\"\n   - There is one entry with \"Name\": \"bounder.\"\n\n3. **Check Relevant Information for 'Bounder':**\n   - According to the table, for \"bounder,\" the following details are relevant:\n     - \"Gender\": \"male\"\n     - \"Book\": \"no\"\n     - \"TV show\": \"yes\"\n\n4. **Verify Claim Against Table Data:**\n   - The claim is specifically about whether \"the male bounder book be no.\"\n   - From the table, it confirms that for \"bounder,\" who is indeed \"male,\" the entry under \"Book\" is \"no.\"\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The conditions in the claim are fully satisfied by the data present for \"bounder.\" \n   - Therefore, the answer to whether the claim is supported by the table is \"TRUE.\"\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - Locate the cells that correspond to the information checked:\n     - \"Name\": \"bounder\" (Row 3)\n     - \"Gender\": \"male\" (Row 3)\n     - \"Book\": \"no\" (Row 3)\n\nBased on these observations, here is the JSON object with relevant details:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Gender\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Book\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
