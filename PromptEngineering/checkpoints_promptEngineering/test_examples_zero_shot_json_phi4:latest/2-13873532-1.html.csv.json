We will analyze the table, which is presented in JSON format with rows and columns representing different categories and years.\n\n### Steps to Evaluate the Claim:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: The relevant data for evaluating Liu Song's ranking would be under the \"ranking tournaments\" category because this relates directly to tournament rankings.\n\n2. **Locate Ranking Tournaments Row**:\n   - The row labeled \"ranking tournaments\" is the 2nd row (index 1) in the table.\n\n3. **Examine Rankings for Each Year**:\n   - We need to check each year's entry under the \"ranking tournaments\" row to identify Liu Song's ranking.\n   - The years are listed as columns: \"2004 / 05\", \"2005 / 06\", \"2007 / 08\", \"2008 / 09\", \"2009 / 10\", \"2010 / 11\", and \"2011 / 12\".\n\n4. **Compare Rankings**:\n   - For the year \"2004 / 05\", the entry is \"90\".\n   - Check other years to ensure there are no worse rankings (higher numbers indicate a lower ranking).\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Year \"2005 / 06\": Ranking is \"88\" which is better than \"90\".\n   - Year \"2007 / 08\": Entry is \"not held\", not applicable.\n   - Year \"2008 / 09\": Entry is \"53\", much better than \"90\".\n   - Year \"2009 / 10\": Entry is \"59\", also better than \"90\".\n   - Year \"2010 / 11\": Entry is \"62\", still better than \"90\".\n   - Year \"2011 / 12\": Entry is \"65\", again better than \"90\".\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The ranking of \"90\" in the season of \"2004 / 05\" is indeed the worst (highest) ranking listed, as all other applicable rankings are lower.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2004 / 05\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2005 / 06\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2007 / 08\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2008 / 09\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2009 / 10\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2010 / 11\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2011 / 12\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object confirms that the claim is true and specifies the relevant cells used to verify it.",

Identify Liu Song's ranking results for the seasons 2010/11 and 2011/12.\n2.

    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim regarding Liu Song's rankings across different years, we first need to analyze the structure of the table and understand what each column and row represents.\n\n### Table Structure:\n- **Columns** represent different years: \"2004 / 05\", \"2005 / 06\", \"2007 / 08\", \"2008 / 09\", \"2009 / 10\", \"2010 / 11\", \"2011 / 12\".\n- **Rows** describe the status or result of tournaments in those years, with specific terms such as:\n  - `wr` (World Ranking)\n  - `lq` (Lost Qualifier)\n  - `a` (Alternate)\n  - `nr` (Not Ranked)\n  - `1r`, `2r`, etc. (Round numbers indicating progress in a tournament)\n\n### Analyzing the Claim:\nThe claim states that Liu Song \"be rank 40 place lower in 2009 / 2010 than in 2005 / 2006\". We need to find rows where Liu Song's ranking is indicated by `wr` or any similar status that reflects their position, and then compare these between the years 2005/06 and 2009/10.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - Look for rows indicating a World Ranking (`wr`) as this directly relates to rank positions.\n   \n2. **Extract Data from Columns for Comparison:**\n   - Find the `wr` status in columns \"2005 / 06\" and \"2009 / 10\".\n\n3. **Comparison:**\n   - Check if there is any indication of a change by 40 places between these two years.\n\n### Examination:\n- The row with World Ranking (`wr`) data can be found at index 4 (0-based indexing).\n  - For the year \"2005 / 06\", the `wr` value is present.\n  - For the year \"2009 / 10\", there is no `wr` status, implying no world ranking position.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Since there is a `wr` in \"2005 / 06\" but not in \"2009 / 10\", it indicates that Liu Song's rank was at least 40 places lower or unranked in \"2009 / 10\". This supports the claim of being ranked 40 places lower.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant cells are those containing `wr` for \"2005 / 06\" and \"2009 / 10\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2005 / 06\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2009 / 10\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about Liu Song's best ranking being in 2008/09 when he made it into the top 50, we need to analyze the table provided and identify the relevant data.\n\n### Table Analysis\n\nThe table includes several columns representing different years and rows representing various categories related to tournaments. Key elements include:\n\n- **Ranking Tournaments**: The main focus for determining Liu Song's ranking.\n- **Non-Ranking Tournaments** and other tournament types are less relevant for this specific claim about rankings.\n- **Not Held**: Indicates no data available for that year in the category.\n\n### Relevant Data\n\nThe first row of numerical data seems to represent some form of ranking or performance metric:\n\n- **2008/09**: The value is \"53\".\n\nTo determine if Liu Song made it into the top 50 during this period, we need to check if any value in the \"ranking tournaments\" category for that year indicates a rank within the top 50.\n\n### Evaluation\n\n1. **Check Ranking Tournaments Row**:\n   - For 2008/09, the entry is \"lq\", which likely stands for \"lost qualifying\" or indicates no qualification.\n   \n2. **Other Rows in Ranking Tournaments**:\n   - No other row under \"ranking tournaments\" for 2008/09 shows a numerical value indicating a rank within the top 50.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince there is no evidence in the table that Liu Song achieved a ranking within the top 50 during 2008/09, the claim is not supported by the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2008 / 09\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ranking tournaments\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"ranking tournaments\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"ranking tournaments\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
