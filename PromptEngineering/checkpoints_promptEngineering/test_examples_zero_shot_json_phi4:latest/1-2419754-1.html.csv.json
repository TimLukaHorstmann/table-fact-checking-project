    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to compare the enrollment numbers for the University of Cincinnati and Saint Louis University.\n\n1. **Identify relevant rows in the data:**\n   - The row corresponding to the University of Cincinnati has an index of 0.\n   - The row corresponding to Saint Louis University has an index of 5.\n\n2. **Locate the \"enrollment\" column for these institutions:**\n   - For each institution, we look at the value in the \"enrollment\" column.\n\n3. **Extract enrollment numbers:**\n   - University of Cincinnati (row index 0) has an enrollment number of 41357.\n   - Saint Louis University (row index 5) has an enrollment number of 13785.\n\n4. **Compare the enrollment numbers:**\n   - The enrollment for the University of Cincinnati is 41357.\n   - The enrollment for Saint Louis University is 13785.\n\nSince 41357 does not equal 13785, the claim that \"the university of cincinnati have the same number of student enrol as saint louis university\" is false.\n\n5. **Identify relevant cells:**\n   - For the University of Cincinnati, the relevant cell is at row index 0 in the \"enrollment\" column.\n   - For Saint Louis University, the relevant cell is at row index 5 in the \"enrollment\" column.\n\nThe final JSON object is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
