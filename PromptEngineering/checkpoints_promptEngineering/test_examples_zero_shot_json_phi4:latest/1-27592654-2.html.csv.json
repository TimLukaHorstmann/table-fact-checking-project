    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"the collingwood electorate is assigned to the nelson province,\" we need to identify the relevant data in the table that pertains to this claim.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim makes two assertions:\n   - The electorate named \"Collingwood\" exists.\n   - This electorate \"Collingwood\" is associated with the \"Nelson\" province.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Columns**:\n   - To verify both parts of the claim, we need to look at two columns in the table: \n     - \"electorate\" to find entries related to \"Collingwood.\"\n     - \"province\" to check if it is associated with \"Nelson.\"\n\n3. **Locating the Data**:\n   - By examining the data in the \"electorate\" column, we identify a row where the electorate is \"collingwood.\"\n   - We then look at the corresponding entry in the \"province\" column for that row to see if it matches \"nelson.\"\n\n4. **Examining the Table**:\n   - The third row of the data contains the following entries:\n     - \"electorate\": \"collingwood\"\n     - \"province\": \"nelson\"\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - In this row, both conditions are met: the electorate is \"Collingwood,\" and it is assigned to the \"Nelson\" province.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the relevant data supports the claim, we conclude that the statement is true.\n\nThe final JSON object representing our findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"electorate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"province\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Nelson be not the province for the electorate of Collingwood,\" we need to verify if the province associated with the electorate \"Collingwood\" is indeed \"Nelson.\"\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:**\n   - The relevant columns for this verification are \"electorate\" and \"province\".\n\n2. **Locate the Electorate \"Collingwood\":**\n   - We need to find the row where the \"electorate\" column has the value \"Collingwood\".\n\n3. **Check the Province for \"Collingwood\":**\n   - Once we identify the row with \"Collingwood,\" we check the corresponding \"province\" value.\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   - The claim states that \"Nelson be not the province for the electorate of Collingwood.\" This means if the province is \"Nelson,\" the claim would be FALSE; otherwise, it would be TRUE.\n\nLet's apply this to the given data:\n\n- Locate the row where \"electorate\" is \"Collingwood\":\n  - Row index 2 has \"collingwood\" in the \"electorate\" column.\n  \n- Check the corresponding \"province\":\n  - In row index 2, the \"province\" is \"nelson\".\n\nSince the province for the electorate \"Collingwood\" is indeed \"Nelson,\" the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row index 2, Column: \"electorate\"\n- Row index 2, Column: \"province\"\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"electorate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"province\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
