    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the data for the \"agricultural panel\" column across all parties.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column**: The \"agricultural panel\" column is our focus since it directly pertains to the claim about having the most members from one party.\n\n2. **Extract values from the \"agricultural panel\" column**:\n   - Fianna F\u00e1il: 4\n   - Fine Gael: 3\n   - Labour Party: 0\n   - Clann na Talmhan: 2\n   - Independent: 1\n\n3. **Determine the maximum value**: The highest number of members from a single party in the \"agricultural panel\" column is 4, which belongs to Fianna F\u00e1il.\n\n4. **Verify if this is indeed the most for any other party**:\n   - No other party has more than 4 members in the \"agricultural panel\". Fine Gael has 3, Clann na Talmhan has 2, and Independent has 1, all less than Fianna F\u00e1il's count of 4.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The claim that one party has the most members in the agricultural panel is true, as Fianna F\u00e1il indeed has the highest number of members (4) among the parties listed.\n\n6. **Relevant cells for verification**:\n   - Fianna F\u00e1il's entry in the \"agricultural panel\" column.\n   - Other entries are not relevant to determining the maximum but help confirm no other party exceeds this number.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"agricultural panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"agricultural panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"agricultural panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"agricultural panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"agricultural panel\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
