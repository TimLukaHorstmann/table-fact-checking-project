    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"stoke city win 1 time and lose over a year later,\" we need to analyze the table for instances involving Stoke City in both winning and losing matches, ensuring that these events occur more than one year apart.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Matches Involving Stoke City:**\n   - Look through each row to find entries where Stoke City is either the winner or loser.\n   \n2. **Determine Wins for Stoke City:**\n   - Check the \"winner\" column to identify any match where Stoke City is listed as the winning team.\n\n3. **Determine Losses for Stoke City:**\n   - Check the \"loser\" column to find matches where Stoke City is listed as the losing team.\n\n4. **Verify Time Gap Between Win and Loss:**\n   - For each win identified, check if there is a corresponding loss more than one year later by comparing the dates in the \"date\" column.\n\n### Detailed Examination:\n\n- **Row 0:** \n  - Winner: Manchester United\n  - Loser: Watford\n  - Stoke City is not involved.\n  \n- **Row 1:**\n  - Winner: Stoke City\n  - Loser: Everton\n  - Date: 7 May 1971\n  - This is a win for Stoke City.\n\n- **Row 2:**\n  - Winner: Birmingham City (after penalties)\n  - Loser: Stoke City\n  - Date: 5 August 1972\n  - This is a loss for Stoke City.\n  - Check the time gap between 7 May 1971 and 5 August 1972:\n    - The period from May 1971 to August 1972 is over one year.\n\n- **Row 3:** \n  - Winner: Wolverhampton Wanderers\n  - Loser: Arsenal\n  - Stoke City is not involved.\n  \n- **Row 4:**\n  - Winner: Burnley\n  - Loser: Leicester City\n  - Stoke City is not involved.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nStoke City won once on 7 May 1971 and lost a match over a year later on 5 August 1972.
