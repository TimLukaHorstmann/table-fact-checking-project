    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to assess the number of instances in which the \"outcome\" column indicates a \"runner-up\". This directly pertains to verifying the claim about match contests where the outcome was runner-up.\n\n### Steps for Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The relevant column to check against the claim is \"outcome\".\n\n2. **Count Instances of \"Runner-Up\"**:\n   - Traverse through each row in the data section of the JSON table.\n   - For each row, check if the value in the \"outcome\" column is \"runner-up\".\n   - Count how many times \"runner-up\" appears.\n\n3. **Compare with Claim**: The claim states that there are 10 match contests resulting in a runner-up outcome. Compare this count against 10.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n- Examine each row to determine if the \"outcome\" column is \"runner-up\":\n\n| Row Index | Outcome   |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| 2         | winner    |\n| 3         | runner-up |\n| 4         | runner-up |\n| 5         | winner    |\n| 6         | runner-up |\n| 7         | runner-up |\n| 8         | runner-up |\n| 9         | runner-up |\n| 10        | runner-up |\n| 11        | runner-up |\n| 12        | runner-up |\n\n- Count the number of \"runner-up\" outcomes:\n  - Rows with \"runner-up\": 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.\n  - Total count = 9.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe table contains 9 instances where the outcome is \"runner-up\".

We will also consider every row since we need to count how many matches occurred in each year.\n\n2. **Count Matches per Year**:\n   - **1969**: 1 match (Buenos Aires, Argentina)\n   - **1970**: 1 match (South Orange, US)\n   - **1971**: 2 matches (Bournemouth, England; Buenos Aires, Argentina)\n   - **1972**: 4 matches (Caracas, Venezuela; Brussels, Belgium; French Open, Paris; Indianapolis, US)\n   - **1973**: 1 match (Buenos Aires, Argentina)\n   - **1974**: 3 matches (Washington DC, US; US Open, New York; Buenos Aires, Argentina)\n   - **1975**: 1 match (Charlotte, US)\n   - **1976**: 2 matches (Berlin, Germany; Santiago, Chile)\n   - **1977**: 3 matches (Murcia, Spain; Indianapolis, US; Santiago, Chile)\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that 4 matches were played in 1972 and implies this is the highest number for any year.\n   - From our count above, 1972 indeed has 4 matches, which is more than any other individual year listed.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   - Since no other year exceeds 4 matches, and 1972 matches the claim exactly with 4 matches, the statement is true based on the given data.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells to verify this claim are all those that contain the \"date\" corresponding to each match entry for every year between 1969 and 1977.\n   - Specifically, we need the rows where the \"date\" column indicates the year 1972 (rows with indices: 5, 6, 7, 8), along with all other years for comparison.\n\nHere is the JSON object representing the solution:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
