The fight with Wayne Cole resulted in a KO (punch).\n\nLet's break it down by examining each relevant row in the data provided in the JSON.\n\n### Step 1: Verify the Result Against Rob Constance\n\n- **Row Index**: 10\n- **Columns to Check**:\n  - `opponent`: \"rob constance\"\n  - `method`: \"decision (split)\"\n\nFrom the table, at row index 10:\n- The opponent is indeed \"rob constance\".\n- However, the method is listed as \"decision (unanimous)\", not \"decision (split)\".\n\nThis indicates that the claim about the fight with Rob Constance is **false**.\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Result Against Wayne Cole\n\n- **Row Index**: 4\n- **Columns to Check**:\n  - `opponent`: \"wayne cole\"\n  - `method`: \"ko (punch)\"\n\nFrom the table, at row index 4:\n- The opponent is indeed \"wayne cole\".\n- The method listed is \"ko (punch)\".\n\nThis indicates that the claim about the fight with Wayne Cole is **true**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe overall claim has one part that is false and one part that is true. For a claim to be fully supported, all parts must be correct. Therefore, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\nNow let's list out the relevant cells we checked:\n\n- Row 10, Column \"opponent\" (to verify opponent as Rob Constance)\n- Row 10, Column \"method\" (to check method for decision type against Rob Constance)\n- Row 4, Column \"opponent\" (to verify opponent as Wayne Cole)\n- Row 4, Column \"method\" (to check method for KO punch against Wayne Cole)\n\nHere is the JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
