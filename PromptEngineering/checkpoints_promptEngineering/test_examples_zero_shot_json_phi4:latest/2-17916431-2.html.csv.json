We look at the \"result\" column and compare Bradford City's scores for home (\"X - Y\") or away (\"Y - X\").\n\n- Match against **Notts County**: Result is 1 - 2 (Bradford scored 1 point).\n- Match against **Macclesfield Town**: Result is 0 - 0 (Bradford scored 0 points).\n- Match against **Aldershot Town** (Home): Result is 5 - 0 (Bradford scored 5 points). This is the highest score so far.\n- Match against **Rochdale**: Result is 3 - 0 (Bradford scored 3 points at home, less than Aldershot Town).\n- Other matches: Scanning through each game, no other match has a higher point total by Bradford City.\n\nFrom this review, the highest number of points Bradford City scored in a single match was against **Aldershot Town**, where they scored 5 goals.\n\n### Step 2: Verifying Opponent\n\nOnce we've established that the maximum score (highest point total) occurred during the match with Aldershot Town, we need to ensure that this particular game aligns with the opponent stated in the claim. \n\nThe relevant row for the highest scoring is against **Aldershot Town**, where they scored 5 - 0.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nTo validate this claim, we look at these specific cells from the table:\n- The match against Aldershot Town (Row index: 7) with a result of 5 - 0, which confirms both highest points and opponent.\n- Additionally, another occurrence where they score 5 is in Row index: 36 against Rochdale but scored less than against Aldershot.\n\nHence, the claim that \"Aldershot Town be the opponent when Bradford City score their highest point total\" is true. The relevant cells to verify this are those indicating the match result and the opponent for the game with the highest points:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON reflects that Aldershot Town was indeed the opponent when Bradford City scored their highest point total in a match.",

    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to analyze two main parts:\n\n1. **Check if Aldershot Town was the opponent on March 10, 2009.**\n2. **Verify if this match corresponds to Bradford City scoring their highest point total in a single game during the season.**\n\nLet's break down these steps using the provided data.\n\n### Step 1: Find the Match on March 10, 2009\n\nWe need to locate the row corresponding to \"date\" of \"10 march 2009\". \n\n- **Row Indexing:** As per our table, starting from row index 0 for the first match and incrementing sequentially, we can find:\n\n   - Row 36 has the date: \"10 march 2009\".\n   - In this row:\n     - The opponent is listed as \"aldershot town\".\n     - The result (\"result\") is \"0 - 3\".\n\n### Step 2: Verify Highest Point Total\n\nFor Bradford City to have scored their highest points in a single match, we need to identify the matches where they scored more than 3 goals:\n\n- **Scoring Analysis:** Let's inspect each row for the number of goals scored by checking the \"result\" column. The format is \"Bradford Goals - Opponent Goals\":\n\n   - Row 7: Result \"5 - 0\" against Rochdale\n   - Row 35: Result \"5 - 0\" against Aldershot Town\n\nThese are the matches where Bradford City scored more than 3 goals in a single match.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **Aldershot Town** as the opponent on \"10 march 2009\" is correct.\n- However, Bradford City did not score their highest point total of 5 goals against Aldershot Town; it was achieved twice: once against Rochdale and again against Aldershot Town (but on a different date).\n\nThus, while part of the claim about the opponent being correct, the specific match does not feature the highest scoring game for Bradford City.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n- The row where the date is \"10 march 2009\" and Aldershot Town as the opponent.\n- All rows must be checked to determine the maximum goals scored in a single match by Bradford City.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Thus, this condition fails.\n\n- **Second Match Verification (28 March 2009):**\n  - Locate the row with the date \"28 march 2009\".\n  - Verify if the opponent is \"port vale\".\n\n  From the table:\n  - Row 38 has the date \"28 march 2009\" and the opponent is \"chester city\", not \"port vale\". Thus, this condition fails.\n\nSince neither of these conditions is satisfied, Bradford City does not play against Port Vale on either of the specified dates.
