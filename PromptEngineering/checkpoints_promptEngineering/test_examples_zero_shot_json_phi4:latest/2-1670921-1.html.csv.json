    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera scored a partnership of 195 runs in Karachi.\n\nLet's analyze each condition from the claim:\n1. **Battling Partners**: The claim states \"Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera\". We must find this exact pair in the \"battling partners\" column.\n2. **Runs Scored Together**: According to the claim, they scored 195 runs together. This must match with what is listed under the \"runs\" column for their partnership.\n3. **Venue**: The claim specifies that this happened in Karachi, which should correspond to an entry in the \"venue\" column.\n\nNow let's locate Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera from the data provided:\n\n- In the 4th row:\n  - Battling Partners: \"mahela jayawardene and thilan samaraweera\"\n  - Runs: 437\n  - Venue: karachi\n\nFrom this information, we can see that Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera did play a partnership in Karachi. However, they scored **437 runs** together, not the claimed **195 runs**.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false as the number of runs does not match the given condition.\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification are:\n- Row 3 (4th row in human terms) under \"battling partners\" to verify the players.\n- Row 3 under \"runs\" to check the number of runs scored.\n- Row 3 under \"venue\" to confirm the location was Karachi.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"battling partners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"runs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
