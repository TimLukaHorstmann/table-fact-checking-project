    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify two conditions:\n\n1. Whether \"academia quintana fc\" was founded in 1969.\n2. If it was indeed founded before all other teams listed in the Puerto Rico Soccer League (PRSL).\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions based on the provided JSON table data:\n\n### Condition 1: Founding Year of Academia Quintana FC\n- We need to check the \"founded\" column for the row corresponding to \"academia quintana fc.\"\n- From the data:\n  - Row index 0 (\"academia quintana fc\") has a founding year of 1969.\n\n### Condition 2: Founding Years of Other Teams\n- We compare the founding years of all teams listed in the table to ensure that no other team was founded before 1969.\n- Let's list the founding years for each team:\n  - Row index 0: \"academia quintana fc\" (founded in 1969)\n  - Row index 1: \"atl\u00e9tico de san juan fc\" (founded in 2008)\n  - Row index 2: \"bayam\u00f3n fc\" (founded in 2009)\n  - Row index 3: \"fajardo fc\" (founded in 2010)\n  - Row index 4: \"guaynabo fluminense fc\" (founded in 2002)\n  - Row index 5: \"gigantes de carolina fc / boca juniors carolina fc\" (founded in 1998)\n  - Row index 6: \"puerto rico islanders fc\" (founded in 2003)\n  - Row index 7: \"cf tornados de humacao\" (founded in 1994)\n\nFrom the founding years listed above, no other team was founded before 1969.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth conditions for the claim are satisfied:\n- Academia Quintana FC was indeed founded in 1969.\n- No other team in the list was founded earlier than 1969.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.

    "resp": "To verify the claim: \"only 1 team be found before 1970, that be the Fajardo FC,\" we need to examine the \"founded\" column of each row in the provided table. The goal is to identify how many teams were founded before 1970 and check if any of them is Fajardo FC.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column:**  \n   We should look at the \"founded\" column for all rows, as this contains the founding years of each club.\n\n2. **Check each team's founding year:**\n   - Academia Quintana FC was founded in 1969.\n   - Atl\u00e9tico de San Juan FC was founded in 2008.\n   - Bayam\u00f3n FC was founded in 2009.\n   - Fajardo FC was founded in 2010.\n   - Guaynabo Fluminense FC was founded in 2002.\n   - Gigantes de Carolina FC / Boca Juniors Carolina FC was founded in 1998.\n   - Puerto Rico Islanders FC was founded in 2003.\n   - CF Tornados de Humacao was founded in 1994.\n\n3. **Determine teams founded before 1970:**\n   - Only Academia Quintana FC meets this criterion (founded in 1969).\n\n4. **Check if Fajardo FC is the team founded before 1970:**\n   - Fajardo FC was founded in 2010, so it does not meet the criteria of being founded before 1970.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that only one team was found before 1970 and identifies it as Fajardo FC. However, our examination reveals that Academia Quintana FC is the only team founded before 1970, not Fajardo FC. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant cell for this verification is in row 0 (Academia Quintana FC) and column \"founded\" because it was founded before 1970.\n  \n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
