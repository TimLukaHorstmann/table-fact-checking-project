    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"ed byhre be the coach of the last ohio valley conference record, after 1961,\" we need to check each relevant cell in the table:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Time Period**: The claim specifies the time period as \"after 1961.\" Therefore, we focus on records from years greater than 1961.\n\n2. **Check Coach for Each Year After 1961**:\n   - For 1979: According to the data, the coach is \"ed byhre.\"\n   \n3. **Verify if 1979 is the Last Entry**: \n   - The last year listed before the total row is 1979.\n   - There are no entries after 1979 in the table.\n\n4. **Determine if 1979 is the Last Ohio Valley Conference Record After 1961**:\n   - Since 1979 is the most recent entry after 1961 and \"ed byhre\" is listed as the coach, this satisfies the condition of being the last recorded conference record for that period.\n\nBased on these observations, the claim is true. The relevant cells to verify this are:\n\n- Row index 5 (year 1979), column \"coach\"\n- Rows from indices 3 to 6 (years after 1961) to confirm no other records exist beyond 1979.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"coach\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
