Lamar Thomas (Miami) is picked at number 60.\n2. Horace Copeland (Miami) is picked at number 104.\n3. Chidi Ahanotu (California) is picked at number 145.\n\nBoth Lamar Thomas and Horace Copeland have picks before Chidi Ahanotu, satisfying the condition that both Miami players are drafted before the California player.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification are:\n\n- Row index 2: Pick 60 (Lamar Thomas from Miami)\n- Row index 3: Pick 82 (John Lynch from Stanford) - Not directly relevant but included to show continuity\n- Row index 4: Pick 91 (Rudy Harris from Clemson) - Not directly relevant but included to show continuity\n- Row index 5: Pick 104 (Horace Copeland from Miami)\n- Row index 6: Pick 145 (Chidi Ahanotu from California)\n\nHere's the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The number of players playing on defense.\n3. The number of players playing on special teams.\n4. The number of players playing on offense.\n\n### Analysis\n\n#### 1. Verify Total Number of Draft Picks\n- According to the claim, there are 10 draft picks in 1993.\n- The table provides data for 10 entries under \"pick,\" confirming that there are indeed 10 draft picks listed.\n\n#### 2. Identify Defensive Players\n- A defensive player typically holds positions such as:\n  - Defensive end (like Eric Curry)\n  - Linebacker (like Demetrius Dubose)\n  - Defensive back (like John Lynch)\n  - Defensive tackle (like Chidi Ahanotu)\n\nFrom the table, we identify:\n- Row 0: Eric Curry, \"defensive end\"\n- Row 1: Demetrius Dubose, \"linebacker\"\n- Row 3: John Lynch, \"defensive back\"\n- Row 7: Chidi Ahanotu, \"defensive tackle\"\n\nThus, there are 4 defensive players.\n\n#### 3. Identify Special Teams Player\n- A special teams player typically holds the position of kicker.\n- From the table, we identify:\n  - Row 9: Daron Alcorn, \"kicker\"\n  \nThus, there is 1 special teams player.\n\n#### 4. Identify Offensive Players\n- An offensive player typically holds positions such as:\n  - Wide receiver (like Lamar Thomas, Horace Copeland, Tyree Davis, Darrick Branch)\n  - Running back (like Rudy Harris)\n\nFrom the table, we identify:\n- Row 2: Lamar Thomas, \"wide receiver\"\n- Row 5: Horace Copeland, \"wide receiver\"\n- Row 6: Rudy Harris, \"running back\"\n- Row 8: Tyree Davis, \"wide receiver\"\n- Row 9: Darrick Branch, \"wide receiver\"\n\nThus, there are 5 offensive players.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that of the 10 draft picks in 1993:\n- 4 are on defense\n- 1 is on special teams\n- 5 are on offense\n\nAll conditions match the data provided in the table. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nWe need to list the relevant rows and columns for verifying these claims:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine if the Buccaneers have only one round with multiple draft picks and identify which round it is.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Unique Rounds:**\n   - From the data, extract the unique rounds from the \"round\" column.\n   - The distinct rounds are: \"round 1\", \"round 2\", \"round 3\", \"round 4\", \"round 6\", \"round 7\", and \"round 8\".\n\n2. **Count Picks per Round:**\n   - Count how many picks occur in each round.\n\n3. **Determine Rounds with Multiple Picks:**\n   - Identify rounds that have more than one pick.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Round 1:** \n  - Pick: 6\n  - Number of picks: 1\n\n- **Round 2:** \n  - Pick: 34\n  - Number of picks: 1\n\n- **Round 3:** \n  - Picks: 60, 82\n  - Number of picks: 2 (Eric Curry and John Lynch)\n\n- **Round 4:** \n  - Picks: 91, 104\n  - Number of picks: 2 (Rudy Harris and Horace Copeland)\n\n- **Round 6:** \n  - Pick: 145\n  - Number of picks: 1\n\n- **Round 7:** \n  - Pick: 176\n  - Number of picks: 1\n\n- **Round 8:** \n  - Picks: 220, 224\n  - Number of picks: 2 (Darrick Branch and Daron Alcorn)\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Rounds with multiple picks are \"round 3\", \"round 4\", and \"round 8\".\n- The claim states that there is only one round with multiple draft picks, which should be \"round 3\". However, we found three rounds with multiple picks.\n\nThus, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells are those in the rows corresponding to \"round 3\", \"round 4\", and \"round 8\" as these contain more than one pick.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
