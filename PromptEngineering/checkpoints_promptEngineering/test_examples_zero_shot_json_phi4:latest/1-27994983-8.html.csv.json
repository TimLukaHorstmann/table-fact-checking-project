We need to check if the \"viewers\" column in this specific row contains the number 69.\n\nNow, let's analyze the table:\n\n- Look for the row with \"draw\" equal to 3:\n  - In the table, the third row (index 2) has \"draw\" value of 3.\n  \n- Check the \"viewers\" value in this row:\n  - In the same row (index 2), under the \"viewers\" column, the number is indeed 69.\n\nThe claim matches the data from the table for draw 3 having 69 viewers.

The number associated with the \"draw\" should indeed correspond to the third entry in the data.\n2. The number of \"juries\" for that specific draw should equal 55.\n\nLet's break down these steps based on the table structure and data:\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n1. **Identify the row corresponding to \"3 draw\":**\n   - The first column in the table represents the \"draw\" numbers.\n   - We need to locate where \"3\" appears under this column to identify the correct row.\n\n2. **Check the \"juries\" value for that row:**\n   - Once we have identified the row with a \"draw\" of 3, we will check the value in the \"juries\" column for this row.\n   - The claim specifies that there should be 55 juries in this draw.\n\n### Applying Steps to the Table\n\n- **Locate Draw 3:**\n  - By examining the first column (under \"draw\"), we find that the third entry is indeed a value of 3. This means the relevant row index for checking is `2` (since indexing starts from zero).\n\n- **Verify Juries Count:**\n  - In the identified row (`index 2`), look at the \"juries\" column.\n  - The table shows that this cell has a value of 55.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are satisfied:\n- The third draw (row index 2) indeed corresponds to the number 3 in the \"draw\" column.\n- This same row lists 55 for the \"juries\" count.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data provided.

In row index 3, we find:\n   - \"artist\": \"brolle\"\n   - \"song (english translation)\": \"7 days and 7 nights\"\n   - \"total\": 29\n\n2. The claim states that \"7 day and 7 night\" have a total of 79 votes. However, from the table data, we see that the actual total is 29, not 79.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect based on the information provided in the table. \n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- Row index 3 for \"song (english translation)\" and \"total\".\n\nThus, the JSON response should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"song (english translation)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
