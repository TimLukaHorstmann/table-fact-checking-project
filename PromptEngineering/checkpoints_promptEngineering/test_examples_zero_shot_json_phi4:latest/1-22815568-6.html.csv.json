The task requires us to identify if there is any county with a population greater than 200536.\n\nHere's the step-by-step verification process:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: We focus on the \"population\" column as it contains all the necessary data to verify the claim about the maximum population.\n\n2. **Iterate Through Population Data**: We will go through each row in the table and check the value of the population for each county.\n\n3. **Comparison with Claimed Maximum**:\n   - The claim states that the maximum population is 200536.\n   - Thus, we need to verify if there are any values greater than 200536 in the \"population\" column.\n\n4. **Check Each Entry**:\n   - Row 0 (Allegany): Population = 49927\n   - Row 1 (Broome): Population = 200536\n   - Row 2 (Cattaraugus): Population = 83955\n   - Row 3 (Chautauqua): Population = 136409\n   - Row 4 (Chemung): Population = 91070\n   - Row 5 (Chenango): Population = 51401\n   - Row 6 (Cortland): Population = 48599\n   - Row 7 (Delaware): Population = 48055\n   - Row 8 (Otsego): Population = 61676\n   - Row 9 (Schoharie): Population = 31582\n   - Row 10 (Schuyler): Population = 19224\n   - Row 11 (Steuben): Population = 98726\n   - Row 12 (Tioga): Population = 51784\n\n5. **Identify Maximum Value**: The highest population value in the data is indeed 200536, which corresponds to Broome County at row index 1.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since no other county has a population greater than 200536, the claim that \"the maximum population record be 200536\" holds true.\n\n7. **Relevant Cells**: The relevant cells for verifying this claim are those where we checked the maximum value:\n   - Row Index: 1 (Broome County with population = 200536)\n\nBased on the analysis above, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"population\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
