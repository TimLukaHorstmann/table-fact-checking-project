The key components in this claim include:\n- The pitcher or player associated with a loss (\"pan wei - lun\").\n- The opponent team (\"chinatrust whales\").\n\nLet's break down the steps required to verify the claim:\n\n1. **Identify Matches Against \"chinatrust whales\":**\n   We need to find rows where the opponent is \"chinatrust whales\". This will help us see if there were any games played against this team.\n\n2. **Check for Losses by \"pan wei - lun\":**\n   For those matches identified in step 1, we must check if \"pan wei - lun\" was recorded as responsible for a loss (\"loss\").\n\n3. **Determine the Outcome:**\n   If there is at least one instance where \"chinatrust whales\" were the opponent and \"pan wei - lun\" was listed under \"loss,\" then the claim is true.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the table:\n\n- **Row 2** (Date: \"3 / 22\"): Opponent is \"chinatrust whales\", Loss is \"kao lung - wei\".\n- **Row 3** (Date: \"3 / 23\"): Opponent is \"chinatrust whales\", Loss is \"pan wei - lun\".\n\nFrom the above analysis, we find that in row 3, \"pan wei - lun\" was indeed responsible for a loss against \"chinatrust whales.\" This directly supports the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE.
