    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"telmo and paulo play on the same team as no 6 and no 9\" is true or false based on the provided table data, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Team Members:**\n   - We are given that Telmo and Paulo should be on a team with housemates numbered 6 and 9.\n   - Housemate numbers correspond to specific names in the last row of the data structure.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Names from Last Row:**\n   - The last row lists:\n     - No 1: ricardo v\n     - No 2: ricardo a\n     - No 3: maria jo\u00e3o\n     - No 4: s\u00f3nia\n     - No 5: carla\n     - **No 6: paulo**\n     - No 7: marta\n     - No 8: m\u00e1rio\n     - **No 9: telmo**\n     - No 10: c\u00e9lia\n     - Last position (not numbered): susana\n\n3. **Determine Team Composition in the Table:**\n   - Analyze each row to find where both Telmo and Paulo are mentioned alongside either number 6 or number 9:\n   \n   - Row 11: All housemates are present, meaning Telmo, Paulo, marta, and m\u00e1rio are grouped together.\n     - \"telmo\" and \"paulo\" are both included in the group.\n     - \"marta\" is no 7, and \"m\u00e1rio\" is no 8. Neither of these corresponds to numbers 6 or 9.\n\n   - Row 12 to 21: Check for any occurrence where telmo and paulo appear with marta (no 6) or mario (no 8). None of these rows list Telmo, Paulo, marta (no 6), or c\u00e9lia (no 9).\n\n4. **Conclusion from Analysis:**\n   - Telmo and Paulo are never grouped with the specific numbers 6 (paulo himself) and 9 (telmo himself) alongside any other members such as marta or m\u00e1rio in a way that supports the claim of playing on \"the same team\" outside their own identities.\n\n5. **Final Decision:**\n   - The claim is false, because while Telmo and Paulo are included by default with themselves (as numbers 9 and 6), there isn't any row where they are grouped as distinct from these identifiers alongside marta or m\u00e1rio in a way that supports the claim of being \"on the same team.\"\n\n6. **JSON Result:**\n   - We find no relevant cells where Telmo, Paulo, and housemates numbered 6 (paulo) and 9 (telmo) play on the same team as described.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
