    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"3.0 be the highest number of goal score in the play - offs that have scored 2 in the FA Cup,\" we need to break down the conditions and check them against the table.\n\n1. **Identify players who scored 2 goals in the FA Cup:**\n   - We look at the column named \"FA Cup\" for entries with a value of 2.\n   - From the data:\n     - Paul Barnes (row index 0) has 2 goals in the FA Cup.\n     - Christian Moore (row index 9) also has 2 goals in the FA Cup.\n\n2. **Check the number of goals scored by these players in the Play-offs:**\n   - We now look at the column named \"Play - offs\" for these specific rows to see how many goals they scored.\n   - For Paul Barnes (row index 0), the play-offs entry is 1.\n   - For Christian Moore (row index 9), the play-offs entry is 0.\n\n3. **Determine if any of these players have a Play-off score of 3 or more:**\n   - Neither player scored 3 or more in the play-offs. The highest is 1 by Paul Barnes.\n\nSince no player who scored 2 goals in the FA Cup has scored 3 or more in the play-offs, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row index 0, column \"FA Cup\"\n- Row index 0, column \"Play - offs\"\n- Row index 9, column \"FA Cup\"\n- Row index 9, column \"Play - offs\"\n\nHere's the JSON object with the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"play - offs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"play - offs\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
