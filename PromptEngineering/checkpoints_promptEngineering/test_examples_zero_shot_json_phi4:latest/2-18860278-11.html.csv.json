Thus, we need to locate David Rose in the dataset and check both his name, the column for the year of his international debut, and verify if it matches 1951.\n\n2. **Locate Row with David Rose**:\n   - From the data, look for an entry where the player is \"David Rose\".\n\n3. **Verify Debut Year**:\n   - Once located, check the value in the column labeled \"year\" to see if it equals 1951.\n\n### Analysis of Data:\n\n- The table's relevant columns are: `player`, `int'l debut`, and `year`.\n  \n- We find David Rose in the data row:\n  ```json\n  [\n    \"David Rose\",\n    \"ru test v france\",\n    1951,\n    \"rlwc great britain v australia\",\n    \"13 nov 1954\",\n    \"three - quarter\"\n  ]\n  ```\n\n### Verification:\n\n- The `year` for David Rose's international debut is indeed **1951**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim that \"David Rose's int'l debut be in 1951\" is supported by the data provided.
