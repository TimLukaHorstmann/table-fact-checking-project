However, the table indicates that only one episode aired in each of these months. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.\n\nNow, we need to identify the relevant cells used for verification:\n- For **January**, the cell corresponding to \"Mystic\" with original air date \"January 21, 2005\" (row index 0).\n- For **June**, the cell corresponding to \"South Beach\" with original air date \"June 10, 2005\" (row index 7).\n\nThese cells are used to verify that only one episode aired in each of these months.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
