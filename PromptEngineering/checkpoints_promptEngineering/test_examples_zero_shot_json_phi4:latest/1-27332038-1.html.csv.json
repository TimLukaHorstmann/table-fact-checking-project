Upon inspection:\n  - Row 39: `\"princess party\"` has `elaine ko` listed as the writer.\n\n- Next, for row 39, we check if Michael Spiller is listed as the director:\n  - In row 39, `\"directed by\": \"michael spiller\"` confirms this condition.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are satisfied by row 39, the claim is TRUE.
