This row does not satisfy the claim.\n   - **Row 1**: Year is 1997; Event is \"marathon\" but this year does not match 2000.\n   - **Row 2**: Year is 1998; Event is \"marathon\", not matching 2000.\n   - **Row 3**: Year is 1999; Event is \"marathon\", not matching 2000.\n   - **Row 4**: \n     - Year is 2000, which matches the year in question.\n     - Event is \"marathon\". This partially supports the claim as a marathon was scheduled.\n     - However, the notes indicate \"dnf\" (did not finish), meaning the event did not complete.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The table shows that while a marathon was scheduled for the year 2000 at the Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, it did not occur as planned because the participant did not finish.\n\nThus, based on this analysis, the claim is false because although a marathon event was scheduled, it did not take place (i.e., the athlete did not complete it).\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"notes\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
