Their starting grid position (grid) is larger than 4.\n3. They are on the \"American Spirit Team Johansson\".\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions based on the data in the table.\n\n### For Ryan Hunter-Reay:\n- **Points**: He has 1 point, which satisfies the condition of having fewer than 2 points.\n- **Grid**: His grid position is 9, which is larger than 4.\n- **Team**: He is listed under \"American Spirit Team Johansson\", satisfying this condition.\n\nRelevant cells for Ryan Hunter-Reay:\n- Row index: 12\n  - Column name: \"points\" (1 point)\n  - Column name: \"grid\" (9)\n  - Column name: \"team\" (\"american spirit team johansson\")\n\n### For Jimmy Vasser:\n- **Points**: He has 0 points, which satisfies the condition of having fewer than 2 points.\n- **Grid**: His grid position is 16, which is larger than 4.\n- **Team**: He is listed under \"American Spirit Team Johansson\", satisfying this condition.\n\nRelevant cells for Jimmy Vasser:\n- Row index: 14\n  - Column name: \"points\" (0 points)\n  - Column name: \"grid\" (16)\n  - Column name: \"team\" (\"american spirit team johansson\")\n\nSince both drivers meet all the conditions specified in the claim, the statement is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to check specific conditions for drivers on the \"patrick racing\" team from the provided table:\n\n1. **Team Check**: We identify drivers who belong to the \"patrick racing\" team.\n2. **Points Condition**: Among these drivers, we look for those with fewer than 2 points.\n3. **Grid Position Condition**: Additionally, these drivers must have a grid position larger than 4.\n\nLet's examine each row in the table data:\n\n- **Row Index 12**: \n  - Driver: \"patrick lemari\u00e9\"\n  - Team: \"pk racing\" (note: not \"patrick racing\", but it seems to be a typo or variation)\n  - Points: 3\n  - Grid: 12\n\nThe points condition is not satisfied for \"patrick lemari\u00e9\" as he has 3 points, which is not fewer than 2.\n\n- **Row Index 18**:\n  - Driver: \"oriol servi\u00e0\"\n  - Team: \"patrick racing\"\n  - Points: 0\n  - Grid: 4\n\nThe grid condition is not satisfied for \"oriol servi\u00e0\" as he has a grid position of 4, which is not larger than 4.\n\nNext, let's check if \"ryan hunter-reay\" meets the conditions:\n\n- **Row Index 13**:\n  - Driver: \"ryan hunter-reay\"\n  - Team: \"american spirit team johansson\" (not \"patrick racing\")\n  - Points: 1\n  - Grid: 9\n\nRyan Hunter-Reay does not belong to the \"patrick racing\" team, so he is irrelevant for this claim.\n\nFrom the analysis, no driver from the \"patrick racing\" team meets both conditions of having fewer than 2 points and a grid position larger than 4.
