    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim \"the Florida Panthers play at home 9 times in March in the 2007 - 2008 season,\" we need to carefully examine the table provided and identify relevant data.\n\n### Steps for Evaluation:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: \n   - The columns \"date\" and \"home\" are crucial for this evaluation. \n     - \"Date\" helps confirm that the games fall in March.\n     - \"Home\" identifies whether Florida is playing at home (when it's listed as \"florida\").\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - Go through each row of data to check if the game occurred in March and if Florida played at home.\n\n3. **Count Matches**:\n   - Count how many times both conditions are met: the game is on a date in March, and Florida is listed as \"home.\"\n\n### Examination of Table:\n\n- **March 2**: Date is in March, Home is \"florida\" \u2192 Relevant\n- **March 4**: Date is in March, Home is \"florida\" \u2192 Relevant\n- **March 6**: Date is in March, Visitor is \"pittsburgh,\" not relevant.\n- **March 8**: Date is in March, Visitor is \"atlanta,\" not relevant.\n- **March 12**: Date is in March, Visitor is \"ny islanders,\" not relevant.\n- **March 14**: Date is in March, Visitor is \"ny rangers,\" not relevant.\n- **March 16**: Date is in March, Visitor is \"atlanta,\" not relevant.\n- **March 20**: Date is in March, Visitor is \"carolina,\" not relevant.\n- **March 22**: Date is in March, Visitor is \"tampa bay,\" not relevant.\n- **March 25**: Date is in March, Visitor is \"florida\" (away game), not relevant.\n- **March 27**: Date is in March, Visitor is \"atlanta,\" not relevant.\n- **March 29**: Date is in March, Visitor is \"washington,\" not relevant.\n\n### Count of Home Games:\nFrom the examination above, there are exactly 2 games where Florida plays at home during March: on March 2 and March 4.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that Florida played 9 home games in March. However, based on the table data, they only played 2 home games in March.
