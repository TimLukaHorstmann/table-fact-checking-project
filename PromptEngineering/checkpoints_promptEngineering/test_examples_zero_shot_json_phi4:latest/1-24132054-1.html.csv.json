The season number is indeed season 3.\n2. The airing dates for this season fall within the specified range: from September 28 to December 7, 2008.\n\n### Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Verify Season Number**\n\nThe claim specifies \"season 3.\" We need to ensure that all entries in the table belong to season 3:\n\n- In the provided data, each row has a `no in season` value. The smallest number here is 1 and the largest number is 11.\n- This indicates that these episodes are from one continuous sequence of episodes within a single season, specifically season 3 since it matches with the claim.\n\n**Relevant Cells for Season Number:**\n- All rows have relevant data under the column \"no in season\" to establish they belong to the same season (season 3).\n\n**Step 2: Verify Airing Dates**\n\nThe claim specifies that these episodes air between September 28 and December 7, 2008. We need to check the `original air date` for each episode:\n\n- The first episode airs on \"September 28, 2008.\"\n- The last episode listed here airs on \"December 7, 2008.\"\n\nWe should ensure all episodes fall within this range:\n\n1. **First Episode (Row 0):**\n   - Original Air Date: September 28, 2008\n\n2. **Last Episode (Row 9):**\n   - Original Air Date: December 7, 2008\n\n3. For completeness, we should check all other episodes:\n   - Row 1 to Row 8 have dates between October 5 and November 16, 2008.\n   - These are within the specified date range.\n\n**Relevant Cells for Airing Dates:**\n- All rows have relevant data under the column \"original air date\" to verify that they fall within the specified date range.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the table.

Identify if the series mentioned in the table is indeed \"Dexter.\"\n2. Count the number of episodes listed under the \"no in season\" column that correspond to the third season.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Series Identification:**\n   - The claim mentions \"The TV series Dexter.\" However, the table does not explicitly state the name of the series. Since we cannot verify from this table alone if these episodes are from Dexter without additional context or information outside of what is provided, we assume that we should focus on verifying the episode count for season 3.\n\n2. **Counting Episodes in Season 3:**\n   - From the table, examine each row under the \"no in series\" and \"no in season\" columns to determine if any episodes belong to the third season.\n   - The relevant column for checking the number of episodes per season is \"no in season.\"\n   - Look for entries where \"no in season\" equals 3.\n\n#### Data Examination\n\n- **Row Analysis:**\n  - Row 0: Season 1\n  - Row 1: Season 2\n  - Row 2: Season 3\n  - Row 3: Season 4\n  - Row 4: Season 5\n  - Row 5: Season 6\n  - Row 6: Season 7\n  - Row 7: Season 8\n  - **Row 8:** Missing (No entry for \"no in season\" equals 9, which would be the next after 8)\n  - Row 9: Season 10\n  - Row 10: Season 11\n\n- Only one episode is listed under \"no in season\" as 3 (Row 2). Therefore, there are not 11 episodes for the third season according to this table.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n- The claim states that there are 11 episodes in the third season.\n- However, only 1 episode from the third season is listed in the provided data.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"The TV series Dexter have more than a dozen episodes in its third season\" is true or false based on the given table, we need to analyze relevant information:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: \n   - A \"dozen\" refers to 12.\n   - The claim states that there are more than 12 episodes in Dexter's third season.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Table**:\n   - We need to identify which season corresponds to the numbers provided and whether they are related to Dexter.\n   - The table provides columns like \"no in series\", \"no in season\", \"title\", etc.\n   - For each row, we look at the \"no in season\" column to determine how many episodes belong to that particular season.\n\n3. **Checking Each Row**:\n   - Rows with relevant data for Dexter's third season are determined by checking the \"no in season\" value (indicating which season an episode belongs to) and verifying if it matches a sequence of more than 12.\n   - We focus on rows where \"no in season\" starts from 1, then continues sequentially without skipping any numbers up to at least 13.\n\n4. **Data Analysis**:\n   - The table shows episodes with the following \"no in season\":\n     - Row 0: Season 1 (Episode 1)\n     - Row 1: Season 2 (Episode 1)\n     - Rows 2-9 do not provide a continuous sequence for any single season beyond row 1.\n     - Row 10 is missing, indicating potential discontinuity or data omission.\n     - Row 11 starts at Season 11, which indicates it\u2019s from a later season.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the provided table, there are no rows that show more than 12 episodes for any single season (specifically Season 3).\n   - There is no evidence in the data to suggest Dexter's third season has more than 12 episodes.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"}, // Missing row\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Lauren Gussis be not a writer for Dexter,\" we need to determine if there is any evidence in the provided table indicating that Lauren Gussis was involved as a writer for an episode of the series \"Dexter.\"\n\n1. **Understanding the Table:**\n   - The table lists episodes from a television series, detailing information such as the episode number, title, director, writers, original air date, and US viewership.\n   - The table is formatted in JSON with columns specifying these details.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Lauren Gussis was not a writer for Dexter. To verify this, we need to check if there are any entries where Lauren Gussis is listed as a writer for an episode of Dexter.\n   - If she appears as a writer in the \"written by\" column for any episode listed, then the claim would be false.\n\n3. **Checking Relevant Entries:**\n   - We will look at the \"written by\" column to identify if Lauren Gussis is mentioned.\n   - The relevant entries from the table are:\n     - Row 6 (Episode 31): \"easy as pie,\" written by Lauren Gussis.\n     - Row 9 (Episode 35): \"i had a dream,\" written by Charles H. Eglee and Lauren Gussis.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Lauren Gussis is listed as a writer for two episodes in the table, this indicates her involvement as a writer for these episodes.\n   - The claim states she was not a writer for Dexter, but the presence of her name in the \"written by\" column for episodes suggests otherwise.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE based on the information provided in the table. The relevant cells are those where Lauren Gussis is listed as a writer.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"written by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"written by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
