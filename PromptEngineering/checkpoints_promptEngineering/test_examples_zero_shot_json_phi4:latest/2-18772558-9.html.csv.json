Identify if there are exactly 13 actors from \"Un posto al sole\" in the table.\n     2. Verify that exactly 5 of these actors have served for 18 years.\n\n2. **Data Analysis**:\n   - The column of interest here is primarily \"soap opera,\" \"years,\" and \"duration.\"\n   - We will filter entries where the \"soap opera\" is \"Un posto al sole.\"\n\n3. **Extracting Relevant Data**:\n   - From the table, extract all rows corresponding to \"Un posto al sole\":\n     1.

We'll examine the data for \"marina giordano\" played by \"nina soldano\" and \"tilly nardi\" played by \"delia boccardo.\"\n\n### Step-by-step Verification\n\n1. **Marina Giordano (played by Nina Soldano):**\n   - According to row 17, Nina Soldano plays Marina Giordano from 2003- with a duration of 11 years.\n   - The data shows no indication of Marina Giordano leaving and returning since the tenure is continuous from 2003-.\n\n2. **Tilly Nardi (played by Delia Boccardo):**\n   - According to row 18, Delia Boccardo plays Tilly Nardi from 1998-2008 with a duration of 10 years.\n   - There's no indication of Tilly Nardi returning after leaving since the data explicitly states her period on \"incantesimo\" ends in 2008.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that Marina Giordano and Tilly Nardi are the only actors to leave their shows and return later. The relevant columns for checking this are \"character,\" \"actor,\" and \"years.\" Based on the provided data:\n\n- Neither character (Marina Giordano nor Tilly Nardi) has a record of leaving and then returning.\n- Therefore, they cannot be considered examples of actors who left their shows and returned.\n\nAs no actor in the table fits the description given in the claim, we conclude that the statement is false. \n\nHere are the relevant cells examined:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"years\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate each actor in the table based on their associated soap operas and compare this with the conditions of the claim.\n\n**Claim Analysis:**\n- \"All actors on the list work on the soap opera 'Un posto al sole' except for 3 who work on 'Un Posto al Sole' and from 'Centovetrine'.\"\n\nBreaking down the claim:\n1. All listed actors should primarily be associated with 'Un posto al sole'.\n2. There are exactly three exceptions where an actor works on both 'Un posto al sole' and 'Centovetrine'.\n\n**Steps for Evaluation:**\n\n1. **Identify Actors Associated with \"Un Posto al Sole\":**\n   - Look at the `soap opera` column to filter actors who have \"un posto al sole\" as their listed soap opera.\n\n2. **Identify Actors Associated with Both \"Un Posto al Sole\" and \"Centovetrine\":**\n   - Check if any actor appears in both \"un posto al sole\" and \"centovetrine\". This requires scanning through the data for entries of these two soap operas under the `soap opera` column.\n\n3. **Verify the Number of Exceptions:**\n   - Ensure that exactly three actors are working on both 'Un posto al sole' and 'Centovetrine'.\n\n**Checking Data:**\n\n1. **Actors in \"Un Posto al Sole\":**\n   - Actors associated with 'Un Posto al Sole' from row indices 0 to 19 (inclusive).\n\n2. **Actors in Both \"Un Posto al Sole\" and \"Centovetrine\":**\n   - Elisabetta Coraini, Pietro Genuardi, Sergio Troiano are listed under `soap opera` as 'centovetrine' starting from year 2001 with a duration of 13 years. \n   - However, these actors (row indices 14-16) do not appear in the data for \"Un Posto al Sole\", so they are incorrect candidates based on the claim.\n\n3. **Validating Exceptions:**\n   - None of the actors listed under 'centovetrine' also have an entry under 'un posto al sole', meaning there are no exceptions where actors work on both soap operas.\n  \n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim states that three actors work on both \"Un Posto al Sole\" and \"Centovetrine\". However, based on the data provided, this is not true as none of the listed actors for 'centovetrine' are working simultaneously or have appeared in entries under 'un posto al sole'.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- The relevant cells to check were those indicating both soap operas (`soap opera` column) and actor names (from `actor` column).\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"soap opera\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"soap opera\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"soap opera\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
