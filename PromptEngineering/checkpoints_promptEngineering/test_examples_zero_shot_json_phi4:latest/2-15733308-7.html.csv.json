This matches our criteria.\n\n     For this row:\n     - Rank is 13.\n\n   - Rows 8 to 17 can be disregarded as their years do not match 1994.\n\n4. **Evaluate Claim**:\n\n   - We found that for the year 1994, the \"biodiversity richness\" has a rank of 13.\n   - The claim states that this rank should be smaller than 54.\n   - Since 13 is indeed smaller than 54, the condition is satisfied.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The claim is true based on the data provided.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n\n   From Row 7:\n   - \"name\" column: \"biodiversity richness\"\n   - \"rank\" column: 13\n   - \"year\" column: 1994\n\nHere's the JSON response with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
