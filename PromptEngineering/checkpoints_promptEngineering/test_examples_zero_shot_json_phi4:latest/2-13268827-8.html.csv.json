Therefore, we cannot validate or refute the claim regarding events from 2006 using the given data.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe main reason we can conclude the claim as FALSE is due to the absence of necessary data for 2006 in the table; thus, we cannot verify any condition related to \"when it be a 2r in 2006\".
