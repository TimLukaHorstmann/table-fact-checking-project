    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"Brian Stanton be the only one who score FA Cup goal\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the relevant columns in the table for each player. Specifically, we will look at the \"fa cup goals\" column because it indicates the number of goals scored by a player in the FA Cup.\n\nHere are the steps and analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The column \"fa cup goals\" is directly related to the claim as it shows the number of goals scored by each player in the FA Cup.\n\n2. **Examine Each Player's FA Cup Goals**:\n   - Terry Austin: 0\n   - Malcolm Brown: 1\n   - David Burke: 0\n   - David Cowling: 0\n   - Brian Cox: 0\n   - Maurice Cox: 0\n   - Steve Doyle: 0\n   - Roy Greenwood: 0\n   - Keith Hanvey: 0\n   - Timothy Hotte: 0\n   - Mick Laverick: 0\n   - Mark Lillis: 0\n   - Keith Mason: 0\n   - Daral Pugh: 0\n   - Colin Russell: 0\n   - **Brian Stanton**: 2 (indicates he scored FA Cup goals)\n   - Kevin Stonehouse: 0\n   - Dave Sutton: 0\n   - Peter Valentine: 0\n   - Phil Wilson: 0\n\n3. **Check for Other Players with FA Cup Goals**:\n   - Malcolm Brown also has 1 goal in the \"fa cup goals\" column.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The claim states that Brian Stanton is the only player who scored an FA Cup goal. However, we found that Malcolm Brown also scored an FA Cup goal. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - Brian Stanton's row (index 16) in \"fa cup goals\" column.\n   - Malcolm Brown's row (index 1) in \"fa cup goals\" column.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
