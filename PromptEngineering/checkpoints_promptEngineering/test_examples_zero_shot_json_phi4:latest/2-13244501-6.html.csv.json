Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are those that contain data about games involving California. These correspond to the rows where California appears as a visitor and the score column for both games listed above.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
