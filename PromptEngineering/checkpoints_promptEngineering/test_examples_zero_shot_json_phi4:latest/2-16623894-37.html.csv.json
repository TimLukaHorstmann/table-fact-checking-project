The score for the first leg (column \"1st leg\") in that particular match is \"1 - 3\".\n\nLet's analyze each part of this claim step by step using the provided JSON data.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n- **Identify Relevant Match**: \n  - We need to find a row where Team 1 is Panathinaikos and Team 2 is Liverpool. Scanning through the \"data\" list:\n    - Row 0: Team 1 is Hamburg, Team 2 is Anderlecht.\n    - Row 1: Team 1 is Rubin Kazan, Team 2 is Wolfsburg.\n    - Row 2: Team 1 is Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Team 2 is Sporting CP.\n    - Row 3: Team 1 is Benfica, Team 2 is Marseille.\n    - Row 4: Team 1 is Panathinaikos, Team 2 is Standard Li\u00e8ge.\n    - **Row 5**: Team 1 is Lille, Team 2 is Liverpool. This row matches the second part of our condition (Team 2 as Liverpool) but not the first (Team 1 should be Panathinaikos).\n    - Row 6: Team 1 is Juventus, Team 2 is Fulham.\n    - Row 7: Team 1 is Valencia, Team 2 is Werder Bremen.\n\n  From this analysis, there is no row where both conditions are met simultaneously (Team 1 as Panathinaikos and Team 2 as Liverpool).\n\n- **Check the First Leg Score**: \n  - Since we couldn't find a match with Team 1 as Panathinaikos and Team 2 as Liverpool, this step becomes irrelevant. However, for completeness:\n    - In Row 5 (Lille vs. Liverpool), the first leg score is \"1 - 0\". This does not meet the claim's condition of \"1 - 3\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe conditions specified in the claim are not met by any row in the table. Therefore, the statement that the first leg score was \"1 - 3\" for a match involving Panathinaikos and Liverpool is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nAlthough no rows matched both conditions of Team 1 being Panathinaikos and Team 2 being Liverpool, we examined Row 5 to verify the first-leg score condition.
