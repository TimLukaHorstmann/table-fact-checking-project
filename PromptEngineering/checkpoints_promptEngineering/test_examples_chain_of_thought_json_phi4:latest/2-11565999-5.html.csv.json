We need to find the row where the first element (index 0) is `9`.\n3. **Extract the Song Title for Track 9**: Once we have identified the correct row for track 9, we will extract the song title from the appropriate column.\n4. **Verify the Claim**: Compare the extracted song title with \"just a little bit\" to verify if they match.\n\nNow let's apply these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Track**:\n   - We are looking for row data where `track` is 9.\n\n2. **Locate the Data for Track 9**:\n   - In the table, we find that row 9 (index 9 in zero-based indexing) contains `[9, \"7 / 22 / 73\", \"raised on rock\", \"just a little bit\", \"2:31\"]`.\n\n3. **Extract the Song Title for Track 9**:\n   - The song title is found in the fourth column of row 9, which is `\"just a little bit\"`.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the song title for track 9 is \"just a little bit\".
