Therefore, the claim is false because it incorrectly identifies Ian Woosnam as an Australian player.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n- **David Graham**:\n  - Row: `t1`, Column: \"country\"\n  \n- **Wayne Riley**:\n  - Row: `t6`, Column: \"country\"\n\n- **Peter Senior**:\n  - Row: `t6`, Column: \"country\"\n\n- **Ian Woosnam**:\n  - Row: `t6`, Column: \"country\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify all Australian players on the leaderboard.
