    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about a multiple artist tie for last place in the 1961 Eurovision Song Contest is true, we need to evaluate the data provided in the table. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure**:\n   - The table has columns: \"draw\", \"language\", \"artist\", \"song\", \"english translation\", \"place\", and \"points\".\n   - Each row represents a song entry with its respective details.\n\n2. **Identify Last Place**:\n   - We need to find entries that are in the last place, which is indicated by the highest \"place\" number.\n   - The maximum value of the \"place\" column will show us what constitutes last place.\n\n3. **Examine the \"Place\" Column**:\n   - Review each entry's \"place\" value to identify the maximum value:\n     - Entry 1: Place = 9\n     - Entry 2: Place = 10\n     - Entry 3: Place = 15\n     - Entry 4: Place = 10\n     - Entry 5: Place = 8\n     - Entry 6: Place = 10\n     - Entry 7: Place = 14\n     - Entry 8: Place = 13\n     - Entry 9: Place = 4\n     - Entry 10: Place = 3\n     - Entry 11: Place = 15\n     - Entry 12: Place = 7\n     - Entry 13: Place = 5\n     - Entry 14: Place = 1\n     - Entry 15: Place = 2\n     - Entry 16: Place = 5\n\n4. **Determine the Last Place Value**:\n   - The maximum \"place\" value is 15, which means entries with place 15 are in last place.\n\n5. **Identify Artists with Last Place**:\n   - Entries with \"place\" equal to 15:\n     - Entry 3: Artist = \"jimmy makulis\"\n     - Entry 11: Artist = \"bob benny\"\n\n6. **Check for Multiple Ties**:\n   - There are two entries (Entries 3 and 11) tied for last place, both with a \"place\" value of 15.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there are multiple artists (\"jimmy makulis\" and \"bob benny\") tied for the last place, the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's format this reasoning into the required JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim of a tie for last place in the Eurovision contest, we examined the 'place' column to find the maximum value. The highest 'place' value was 15, found in entries 3 and 11. Both entries are tied for last place with different artists: 'jimmy makulis' and 'bob benny'. Therefore, there is indeed a multiple artist tie for last place.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"artist\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
