We need to find any row where Guy Mezger was defeated, and check if it occurred in round 4.\n\n4. **Check Duration of the Match:**\n   - Finally, verify that this win happened in exactly \"5 minutes.\" The table provides time in a format which may be directly comparable or will need conversion (e.g., checking if given as \"5:00\" or similar).\n\nLet's apply these steps to the data:\n\n- **Row 19:** Guy Mezger is listed as an opponent with a \"win\" recorded. The round number for this win is 1, and the duration is \"9:56\". This does not satisfy the criteria of round 4 in exactly 5 minutes.\n\n- **Row 13:** Guy Mezger is again listed as an opponent, but the outcome here is a \"loss.\" Therefore, it doesn't qualify as a win.\n\nSince neither instance matches all the conditions stated (win against Guy Mezger in round 4 lasting 5 minutes), we conclude that the claim is FALSE. \n\nThe relevant cells for this evaluation are from Row 13 and Row 19 where Guy Mezger appears as an opponent:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate rows with 'Guy Mezger' as the opponent.
