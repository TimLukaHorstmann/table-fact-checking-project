The \"team\" column tells us which team played, and we are interested in games where Milwaukee Bucks were the home team, as indicated by their location, \"Bradley Center\".\n\n2. **Count Games at Bradley Center**:\n   - Go through each row of the data to check if the \"location attendance\" mentions \"bradley center\".\n   - Count these occurrences to see how many games were played at Bradley Center.\n\n3. **Check Each Row for Bradley Center**:\n   - **Row 1**: \"portland\", location is \"bradley center\".\n   - **Row 4**: \"new orleans\", location is \"bradley center\".\n   - **Row 5**: \"new york\", location is \"bradley center\".\n   - **Row 7**: \"la lakers\", location is \"bradley center\".\n   - **Row 8**: \"atlanta\", location is not \"bradley center\" (Philadelphia).\n   - **Row 9**: \"golden state\", location is \"bradley center\".\n   - **Row 10**: \"philadelphia\", location is not \"bradley center\" (Wells Fargo Center).\n   - **Row 11**: \"oklahoma city\", location is \"bradley center\".\n\n4. **Total Count**:\n   - Games at Bradley Center: Rows 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 11.\n   - Total = 6 games.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states there were 6 games played at Bradley Center during the Milwaukee Bucks' 2010-11 season.
