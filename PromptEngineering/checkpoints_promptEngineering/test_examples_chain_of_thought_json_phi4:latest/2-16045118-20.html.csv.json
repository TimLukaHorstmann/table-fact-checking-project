Here are the steps for reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: We focus on entries where the result is \"won\". These represent the awards actually won.\n\n2. **Filter by Year**: Since we're interested only until 2012, we should exclude any data from years after 2012 (i.e., 2013 and onwards).\n\n3. **Count Wins**: Go through each relevant row to count how many wins occur before or in the year 2012.\n\n4. **Verify Each Win**:\n    - 1973: Diana Ross won \"new star - actress\" for \"lady sings the blues\".\n    - 1986: Whoopi Goldberg won \"best actress - drama\" for \"the color purple\".\n    - 1991: Whoopi Goldberg won \"best supporting actress\" for \"ghost\".\n    - 1994: Angela Bassett won \"best actress - musical or comedy\" for \"what's love got to do with it\".\n    - 2007: Jennifer Hudson won \"best supporting actress\" for \"dreamgirls\".\n    - 2010: Mo'Nique won \"best supporting actress\" for \"precious: based on the novel 'push' by Sapphire\".\n    - 2012: Octavia Spencer won \"best supporting actress\" for \"the help\".\n\n5. **Count Total Wins**: Summarize the total number of wins:\n   - Diana Ross (1 win)\n   - Whoopi Goldberg (2 wins)\n   - Angela Bassett (1 win)\n   - Jennifer Hudson (1 win)\n   - Mo'Nique (1 win)\n   - Octavia Spencer (1 win)\n\nThe total number of wins is 7.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The claim states there are 9 wins by black actors until 2012, but we have found only 7 such wins. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's format this reasoning in a JSON object as requested:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows where 'result' is 'won'.\",\n    \"Filter these entries to include only those from years up to and including 2012.\",\n    \"Count the number of wins for black actors until 2012: Diana Ross (1), Whoopi Goldberg (2), Angela Bassett (1), Jennifer Hudson (1), Mo'Nique (1), Octavia Spencer (1).\",\n    \"Total wins count is 7, not 9 as claimed.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
