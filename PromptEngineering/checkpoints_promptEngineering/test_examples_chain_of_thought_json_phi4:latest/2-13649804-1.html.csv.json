That Steve Brady scored 284 in 1993.\n     b.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the lowest championship score being 206 by Fred Funk in 1984 is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Score for Fred Funk in 1984:**\n   - Locate the row where the year is 1984.\n   - Check the \"score\" column for this row.\n\n2. **Verify if 206 is the Lowest Score:**\n   - Compare the score of 206 with all other scores listed in the table to ensure there are no lower scores.\n\n3. **Examine All Scores:**\n   - Look through each entry in the \"score\" column across all years.\n   - Note any scores that are less than or equal to 206.\n\n4. **Check for Ties:**\n   - Determine if any other player achieved a score of 206, which would mean Fred Funk did not have the unique lowest score.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - If no score is lower than 206 and Fred Funk's score is indeed 206, then the claim is true.\n   - If there are scores lower than 206 or another player also achieved a score of 206, the claim is false.\n\n### Analysis\n\n- **Fred Funk's Score in 1984:**\n  - Year: 1984\n  - Champion: Fred Funk\n  - Score: 206\n\n- **Comparison with Other Scores:**\n  - The lowest scores found in the table are:\n    - 205 (Steve Gotsche, 1990)\n    - 205 (Webb Heintzelman, 1988)\n    - 205 (John Jackson, 1980)\n\nSince there are scores of 205, which are lower than Fred Funk's score of 206, the claim that 206 is the lowest championship score is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n- Fred Funk's score in 1984: {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n- Scores of 205:\n  - Steve Gotsche, 1990: {\"row_index\": 39, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  - Webb Heintzelman, 1988: {\"row_index\": 40, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  - John Jackson, 1980: {\"row_index\": 46, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Fred Funk's score in 1984 was 206.
