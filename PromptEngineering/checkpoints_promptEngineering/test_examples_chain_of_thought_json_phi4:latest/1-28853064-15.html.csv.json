    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"sergio luis henao be give the general classification award and the point classification award\" is true or false, we need to examine the data provided for each stage of the race.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim involves two awards: the General Classification and the Points Classification, both awarded to \"Sergio Luis Henao\".\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Columns**:\n   - **General Classification**: This column indicates who held this award after each stage.\n   - **Points Classification**: This column shows who had accumulated the most points up to that stage.\n\n3. **Examine Each Stage for General Classification**:\n   - **Stage 1**: \"Sergio Luis Henao\" is listed as the winner, but there's no general classification awarded yet (indicated by \"no award\").\n   - **Stages 2-5**: \"\u00d3scar Sevilla\" holds the general classification.\n   - **Stage 6**: \"\u00d3scar Sevilla\" continues to hold it.\n   - **Stage 7**: \"\u00d3scar Sevilla\" still leads.\n   - **Stage 8**: \"\u00d3scar Sevilla\" maintains the lead.\n   - **Stage 9**: \"Sergio Luis Henao\" takes the general classification from \"\u00d3scar Sevilla\".\n   - **Stages 10-13**: \"Sergio Luis Henao\" retains the general classification.\n\n4. **Examine Each Stage for Points Classification**:\n   - **Stage 1**: No points classification awarded.\n   - **Stages 2-6**: \"Jaime Casta\u00f1o\" holds the points classification initially, followed by \"Jaime Vergara\".\n   - **Stage 7**: \"Camilo G\u00f3mez\" wins the stage and takes the points classification.\n   - **Stages 8-9**: \"\u00d3scar Sol\u00eds\" takes over the points classification.\n   - **Stages 10-13**: \"\u00d3scar Sol\u00eds\" continues to hold the points classification.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Sergio Luis Henao does receive the General Classification award from Stage 9 onwards.\n   - However, he never receives the Points Classification award at any stage.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim that \"sergio luis henao be give the general classification award and the point classification award\" is false because while he did win the General Classification award, he never won the Points Classification award.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The data was examined stage by stage for both the General Classification and the Points Classification awards.
