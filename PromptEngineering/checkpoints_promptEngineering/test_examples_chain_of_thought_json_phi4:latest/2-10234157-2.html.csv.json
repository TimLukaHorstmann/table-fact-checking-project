    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"neither Charlie Hodgson, Adrian Jarvis nor Alberto di Bernardo have less than 2 tries\" is true or false, we need to examine the number of tries for each mentioned player from the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Players**: \n   - The players in question are Charlie Hodgson, Adrian Jarvis, and Alberto di Bernardo.\n   \n2. **Locate Player Data**:\n   - From the table, find the rows corresponding to each player and examine their \"tries\" value.\n\n3. **Examine Each Player's Tries**:\n\n   - **Charlie Hodgson**:\n     - Row: 1 (since he is listed second in the data array)\n     - Column: \"tries\"\n     - Value: 0\n     - Conclusion: Charlie Hodgson has less than 2 tries.\n   \n   - **Adrian Jarvis**:\n     - Row: 8 (since he is listed ninth in the data array)\n     - Column: \"tries\"\n     - Value: 0\n     - Conclusion: Adrian Jarvis has less than 2 tries.\n\n   - **Alberto di Bernardo**:\n     - Row: 6 (since he is listed seventh in the data array)\n     - Column: \"tries\"\n     - Value: 0\n     - Conclusion: Alberto di Bernardo has less than 2 tries.\n\n4. **Evaluate Claim Against Findings**:\n   - The claim states that none of these players have less than 2 tries.\n   - All three players (Charlie Hodgson, Adrian Jarvis, and Alberto di Bernardo) have 0 tries, which is indeed less than 2.\n\n5. **Determine Truth Value**:\n   - Since each player has less than 2 tries, the claim \"neither Charlie Hodgson, Adrian Jarvis nor Alberto di Bernardo have less than 2 tries\" is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Charlie Hodgson: `{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tries\"}`\n- Adrian Jarvis: `{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"tries\"}`\n- Alberto di Bernardo: `{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tries\"}`\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Charlie Hodgson, Adrian Jarvis, and Alberto di Bernardo have 2 or more tries. Checking the table, each of these players has 0 tries, which is less than 2. Therefore, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tries\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
