We need to identify all such entries.\n\n3. **Count Episodes Directed by Each Director in 2009:**\n   - For each row corresponding to the year 2009, check if \"directed_by_chip_hurd\" is `TRUE` and count these occurrences.\n   - Similarly, for each row corresponding to the year 2009, check if \"directed_by_kim_fields\" is `TRUE` and count these occurrences.\n\n4. **Compare Counts:**\n   - Compare the total counts of episodes directed by Kim Fields and Chip Hurd in 2009.\n\n5. **Draw Conclusion:**\n   - Determine if the number of episodes directed by Kim Fields is greater than those directed by Chip Hurd.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Rows from 2009:**\n\n  | Row Index | Air Date       | Directed by Chip Hurd | Directed by Kim Fields |\n  |-----------|----------------|-----------------------|------------------------|\n  | 1         | February, 2009 | TRUE                  | FALSE                  |\n  | 2         | March, 2009    | TRUE                  | FALSE                  |\n  | 3         | April, 2009    | TRUE                  | FALSE                  |\n  | 4         | May, 2009      | TRUE                  | FALSE                  |\n  | 5         | June, 2009     | TRUE                  | FALSE                  |\n  | 6         | July, 2009     | TRUE                  | FALSE                  |\n  | 7         | August, 2009   | TRUE                  | FALSE                  |\n  | 8         | September, 2009| TRUE                  | FALSE                  |\n  | 9         | October, 2009  | TRUE                  | FALSE                  |\n  | 10        | November, 2009 | TRUE                  | FALSE                  |\n  | 11        | December, 2009 | TRUE                  | FALSE                  |\n\n- **Count of Episodes Directed:**\n  - **Chip Hurd:** 11 episodes directed in 2009.\n  - **Kim Fields:** 0 episodes directed in 2009.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince Kim Fields directed 0 episodes and Chip Hurd directed 11 episodes in 2009, there are not more episodes directed by Kim Fields than by Chip Hurd during that year.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, filter the data to include only rows from the year 2009.
