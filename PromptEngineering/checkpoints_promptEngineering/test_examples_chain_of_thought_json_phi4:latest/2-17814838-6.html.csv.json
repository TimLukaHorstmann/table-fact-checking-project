    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to compare the average attendance for matches involving Arsenal with those involving Manchester United based on the given table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Matches Involving Arsenal:**\n   - **Row 7:** \"cardiff city\" vs. \"arsenal\", Attendance = 20,079\n   - **Row 7 Replay:** \"arsenal\" vs. \"cardiff city\", Attendance = 57,237\n\n2. **Calculate the Average Attendance for Arsenal Matches:**\n   - Total attendance for Arsenal matches = 20,079 + 57,237 = 77,316\n   - Number of Arsenal matches = 2\n   - Average attendance for Arsenal matches = 77,316 / 2 = 38,658\n\n3. **Identify Matches Involving Manchester United:**\n   - **Row 2:** \"manchester united\" vs. \"tottenham hotspur\", Attendance = 75,014\n\n4. **Calculate the Average Attendance for Manchester United Matches:**\n   - Total attendance for Manchester United matches = 75,014\n   - Number of Manchester United matches = 1\n   - Average attendance for Manchester United matches = 75,014 / 1 = 75,014\n\n5. **Compare the Averages:**\n   - Arsenal's average attendance = 38,658\n   - Manchester United's average attendance = 75,014\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that the match with Arsenal has an average attendance \"than\" the match with Manchester United.\n   - Since 38,658 is less than 75,014, the claim is TRUE if it implies Arsenal's average attendance is lower.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 2, Column \"attendance\" for Manchester United\n- Row 7, Column \"attendance\" for Arsenal vs. Cardiff City\n- Replay of Row 7, Column \"attendance\" for Arsenal\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the matches involving Arsenal and calculate their average attendance.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze the data provided in the table regarding goal scores for each tie.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Structure of the Table:**\n   - The table includes columns for \"tie no\", \"home team\", \"score\", \"away team\", and \"attendance\".\n   - Some rows have a \"replay\" label indicating that they are replay matches following an initial tie.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Ties:**\n   - We need to focus on the scores for each tie, particularly looking for ties between West Bromwich Albion and Burnley.\n\n3. **Locate West Bromwich Albion vs. Burnley Ties:**\n   - Locate the rows with \"west bromwich albion\" as either the home or away team against \"burnley\".\n   - We find two entries:\n     - Row 15: \"west bromwich albion\" vs. \"burnley\" with a score of \"2 - 2\".\n     - Row 16 (replay): \"burnley\" vs. \"west bromwich albion\" with a score of \"3 - 1\".\n\n4. **Calculate Total Goals for the Ties:**\n   - For the first match (Row 15), the total goals scored by both teams is \\(2 + 2 = 4\\).\n   - For the replay (Row 16), the total goals scored by both teams is \\(3 + 1 = 4\\).\n\n5. **Sum Goals Across Both Matches:**\n   - The combined score for both matches in this tie is \\(4 + 4 = 8\\).\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the highest goal score by both teams in a tie was 8 when West Bromwich Albion tied Burnley 7-7.\n   - While the total number of goals scored across both matches (8) is correct, the claim incorrectly describes the match outcome as 7-7.\n\n7. **Check for Other Ties with Higher Total Goals:**\n   - We need to verify if any other tie has a higher combined score:\n     - Review all ties and calculate the total goals for each.\n     - For example:\n       - Row 2: \"manchester united\" vs. \"tottenham hotspur\", \\(2 + 1 = 3\\).\n       - Row 7 and its replay (Row 8): \"cardiff city\" vs. \"arsenal\", \\(0 + 0 = 0\\) and \\(4 + 0 = 4\\), combined \\(0 + 4 = 4\\).\n       - Continue this process for all ties.\n   - No other tie has a total of more than 8 goals.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim about the highest goal score being 8 is correct in terms of the number of goals, but it incorrectly describes the match as 7-7 instead of the actual scores (2-2 and 3-1).\n- Therefore, the statement is FALSE due to incorrect details regarding the match outcome.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows two matches between West Bromwich Albion and Burnley with scores of 2-2 and 3-1.
