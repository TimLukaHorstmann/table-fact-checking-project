We will focus on entries from that year in our analysis.\n\n2. **Check for Categories**: Look through the `category` column of each entry in the year 2001 to see if there is a category labeled \"best support actress\" or any similar wording.\n\n3. **Review Relevant Entries**:\n   - There are multiple categories listed under the year 2001.\n   - We need to find an exact match for \"best support actress\" or its variations (e.g., \"best supporting actress\").\n\n4. **Analyze Each Entry**:\n   - The entry `[2001, \"tvynovelas awards\", \"best lead actress\", \"aracely ar\u00e1mula\", \"nominated\"]` does not match.\n   - The entry `[2001, \"tvynovelas awards\", \"best lead actor\", \"fernando colunga\", \"won\"]` does not match.\n   - The entry `[2001, \"tvynovelas awards\", \"best female villain\", \"nailea norvind\", \"won\"]` does not match.\n   - The entry `[2001, \"tvynovelas awards\", \"best male villain\", \"c\u00e9sar \u00e9vora\", \"won\"]` does not match.\n   - **Relevant Entry**: The entry `[2001, \"tvynovelas awards\", \"best supporting actress\", \"carmen salinas\", \"nominated\"]` matches the category name with a slight variation (\"supporting\" instead of \"support\").\n   - Other entries do not match the specified category.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The table does contain a category for \"best supporting actress\" in 2001, which is similar to \"best support actress\".\n   - Therefore, the claim is true if we consider \"supporting\" as synonymous with \"support\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table contains an entry for 'best supporting actress' under the year 2001.

Whether Nailea Norvind won for a specific category.\n  2. What category is associated with the winners.\n\n### Step 2: Examine the Table Data\nWe'll look at each entry related to \"best male villain\" and other relevant categories:\n\n#### Relevant Entries from the Table:\n- **Row 5**: \n  - Category: \"best male villain\"\n  - Nominee: \"C\u00e9sar \u00c9vora\"\n  - Result: \"won\"\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Category: \"best female villain\"\n  - Nominee: \"Nailea Norvind\"\n  - Result: \"won\"\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Claim Against the Table Data\n1.
