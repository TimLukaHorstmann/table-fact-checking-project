    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"217 be the lowest 1st lbsc number with a lbsc name of granville\" is true or false, we'll follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: \n   - We need to examine both the \"1st lbsc no\" and \"lbsc name\" columns.\n\n2. **Locate the Specific Lbsc Name**:\n   - Look for entries in the table where the \"lbsc name\" is \"granville\".\n\n3. **Extract Corresponding 1st Lbsc Numbers**:\n   - Note down the \"1st lbsc no\" associated with each occurrence of the \"lbsc name\" \"granville\".\n\n4. **Determine the Lowest Number**:\n   - Compare all extracted \"1st lbsc no\" values to identify the lowest one.\n\n5. **Verify Claim Against Extracted Data**:\n   - Check if 217 is indeed the lowest number found in step 4.\n\n### Detailed Examination\n\n- **Row Analysis**:\n  - **Row Index 15**: \n    - \"1st lbsc no\": 216\n    - \"lbsc name\": granville\n  \n- **Extracted Data**:\n  - The only occurrence of \"granville\" has an associated \"1st lbsc no\" of 216.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The lowest \"1st lbsc no\" for the \"lbsc name\" granville is 216, not 217.\n- Therefore, the claim that \"217 be the lowest 1st lbsc number with a lbsc name of granville\" is false.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The relevant column 'lbsc name' was examined for entries labeled 'granville'. The corresponding '1st lbsc no' values were extracted. The lowest value found was 216, not 217.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"1st lbsc no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"lbsc name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
