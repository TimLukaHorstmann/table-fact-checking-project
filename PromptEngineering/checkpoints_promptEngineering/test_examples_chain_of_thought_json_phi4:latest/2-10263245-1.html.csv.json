    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the oldest fight that Librado Andrade won was on 2011-08-27\" is true, we need to analyze the table for all wins by Librado Andrade and find the earliest date among them.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify All Wins**: First, extract all rows where the result is \"win\". These represent fights that Librado Andrade won.\n\n2. **Extract Dates of Wins**:\n   - The relevant columns for this task are \"result\", \"date\", and \"row_index\".\n   - We need to look at each row with a \"result\" of \"win\" and record the corresponding date.\n   \n3. **Compare Dates**: Once we have all the dates of wins, identify the earliest one.\n\n4. **Verify Claim Against Earliest Date**:\n   - The claim states that the oldest win was on 2011-08-27.\n   - Compare this date with the earliest date found from the list of wins.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: If the earliest win matches the date in the claim, then the statement is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\n### Applying Steps to Data:\n\n- **Wins and Dates**:\n  - Row 1: Date \"2011-08-27\" (Matt O'Brien)\n  - Row 3: Date \"2010-05-28\" (Eric Lucas)\n  - Row 4: Date \"2009-11-28\" (Vitali Tsypko)\n  - Row 5: Date \"2008-03-22\" (Robert Stieglitz)\n  - Row 6: Date \"2007-10-06\" (Yusaf Mack)\n  - Row 7: Date \"2007-07-21\" (Ted Muller)\n  - Row 8: Date \"2006-09-15\" (Richard Grant)\n  - Row 9: Date \"2006-04-08\" (Otis Grant)\n  - Row 10: Date \"2005-02-04\" (Nicolas Cervera)\n  - Row 11: Date \"2004-12-16\" (Thomas Reid)\n  - Row 12: Date \"2004-09-27\" (Ruben Perez)\n  - Row 13: Date \"2004-06-19\" (Jimmy Hagar)\n  - Row 14: Date \"2004-05-24\" (Harold Lowe)\n  - Row 15: Date \"2004-03-29\" (Eric Benito Tzand)\n  - Row 16: Date \"2003-01-18\" (Sheridan Page)\n  - Row 17: Date \"2000-08-17\" (Marcus Harvey)\n  - Row 18: Date \"2000-05-18\" (Bernard Temple)\n  - Row 19: Date \"2000-04-13\" (Terry Smith)\n  - Row 20: Date \"2000-02-03\" (Paul Jones)\n  - Row 21: Date \"1999-12-02\" (George Johnson)\n  - Row 22: Date \"1999-08-14\" (Marcus Harvey)\n\n- **Earliest Date**: The earliest date is \"1999-08-14\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that the oldest win was on \"2011-08-27\" is false because the actual oldest win occurred on \"1999-08-14\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified all wins and their dates.
