    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"a total of 850 points be score during their 10 wins\" is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Winning Games**: We first identify which games are marked as wins (\"W\") in the \"score\" column.\n\n2. **Extract Scores from Winning Games**: For each winning game, extract the total points scored by the team. This requires parsing the score string to find the number of points scored by the team (the first number before the dash).\n\n3. **Sum the Points**: Add up all the points scored in these winning games.\n\n4. **Verify Against Claim**: Check if the sum equals 850 as stated in the claim.\n\nLet's go through each step using the data from the table:\n\n1. **Identify Winning Games**:\n   - Game 60: \"W 112 - 104\"\n   - Game 61: \"W 101 - 94\"\n   - Game 62: \"W 97 - 91\"\n   - Game 63: \"W 109 - 101\"\n   - Game 64: \"W 112 - 100\"\n   - Game 68: \"W 103 - 88\"\n   - Game 69: \"W 101 - 94\"\n   - Game 70: \"W 99 - 86\"\n   - Game 72: \"W 104 - 99\"\n   - Game 73: \"W 112 - 104\"\n\n2. **Extract Scores**:\n   - Game 60: Team scored 112 points.\n   - Game 61: Team scored 101 points.\n   - Game 62: Team scored 97 points.\n   - Game 63: Team scored 109 points.\n   - Game 64: Team scored 112 points.\n   - Game 68: Team scored 103 points.\n   - Game 69: Team scored 101 points.\n   - Game 70: Team scored 99 points.\n   - Game 72: Team scored 104 points.\n   - Game 73: Team scored 112 points.\n\n3. **Sum the Points**:\n   - Total = 112 + 101 + 97 + 109 + 112 + 103 + 101 + 99 + 104 + 112\n   - Total = 1050\n\n4. **Verify Against Claim**: The claim states that a total of 850 points were scored during their 10 wins. Our calculated total is 1050, which does not match the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the winning games from the 'score' column marked as 'W'.\",\n    \"Extract the points scored by the team in each of these winning games.\",\n    \"Sum the points scored across all identified winning games.\",\n    \"Compare the calculated total with the claim of 850 points.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 60, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 61, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 62, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 63, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 64, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 68, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 69, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 70, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 72, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 73, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Deron Williams only scored the highest number of assists for the Utah Jazz before March 10\" is true or false, we need to analyze the data from the provided table. We will specifically focus on the \"high assists\" column and check if Daron Williams has recorded the highest number of assists in any game after March 10.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:**\n   - The claim suggests that Daron Williams was the player with the highest number of assists only before March 10.\n   - We need to verify if there are any games after March 10 where he did not have the highest assists or if someone else had more.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - Examine each game entry from March 11 onwards to check the \"high assists\" column and see who recorded the most assists in those games.\n   - Specifically, look for entries after March 10 where Daron Williams is not listed as having the highest number of assists or another player had more.\n\n3. **Analyze Data from March 11 Onwards:**\n\n   - **March 11 (Game 65):** \n     - High Assists: Daron Williams (9)\n     - No other player listed, so he has the highest assists.\n   \n   - **March 14 (Game 66):**\n     - High Assists: Daron Williams (13)\n     - Again, no other player listed, so he has the highest assists.\n\n   - **March 15 (Game 67):**\n     - High Assists: Daron Williams (9)\n     - No other player listed, so he has the highest assists.\n   \n   - **March 17 (Game 68):**\n     - High Assists: Daron Williams (8)\n     - No other player listed, so he has the highest assists.\n\n   - **March 20 (Game 69):**\n     - High Assists: Daron Williams (11)\n     - No other player listed, so he has the highest assists.\n   \n   - **March 24 (Game 70):**\n     - High Assists: Daron Williams (12)\n     - No other player listed, so he has the highest assists.\n\n   - **March 25 (Game 71):**\n     - High Assists: Daron Williams (10)\n     - No other player listed, so he has the highest assists.\n   \n   - **March 28 (Game 72):**\n     - High Assists: Daron Williams (13)\n     - No other player listed, so he has the highest assists.\n\n   - **March 30 (Game 73):**\n     - High Assists: Daron Williams (13)\n     - No other player listed, so he has the highest assists.\n   \n   - **March 31 (Game 74):**\n     - High Assists: Daron Williams (8)\n     - No other player listed, so he has the highest assists.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - In all games after March 10, Daron Williams consistently recorded the highest number of assists.\n   - Therefore, there is no instance where someone else had more assists or where he did not have the highest number.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis, the claim that \"Deron Williams only scored the highest number of assist for the Utah Jazz before March 10\" is false. He continued to record the highest number of assists after March 10 as well.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Analyzed each game from March 11 onwards in the 'high assists' column.
