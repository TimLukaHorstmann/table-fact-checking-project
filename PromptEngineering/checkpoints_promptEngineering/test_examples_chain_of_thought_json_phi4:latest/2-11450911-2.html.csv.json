This is her first win.\n\n3. **Examine Matches After Her First Win:**\n   - We now analyze the rows following her first win to count how many times she lost:\n     - Row 5: \"win\" against Mamiko\n     - Row 6: \"loss\" against Hitomi Akano (first loss after her initial win)\n     - Row 7: \"win\" against Kamei Natsuko\n     - Row 8: \"loss\" against Megumi Fujii (second loss after her first win)\n   - Further losses continue, but we only need to confirm two losses following the first win.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Keiko Tamai lost twice after her first recorded win.\n\n### Final Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
