However, let's continue to verify the assist condition for completeness.\n\n#### Row 2: April 7 vs LA Clippers\n- High Assists: Brandon Roy with 6 assists.\n- High Points: LaMarcus Aldridge with 27 points.\n\nBrandon Roy led in assists and was not the high scorer, so this game supports the claim regarding assists but also confirms he wasn't always the high scorer (consistent with the second part of the claim).\n\n#### Row 3: April 9 vs Dallas\n- High Assists: Brandon Roy with 6 assists.\n- High Points: LaMarcus Aldridge with 27 points.\n\nBrandon Roy led in assists and was not the high scorer, consistent with the claim.\n\n#### Row 4: April 11 vs LA Lakers\n- High Assists: Andre Miller with 7 assists.\n- High Points: LaMarcus Aldridge with 24 points.\n\nIn this game, Brandon Roy did not lead in assists (Andre Miller had more). Thus, the first part of the claim is FALSE based on this data point alone.\n\n#### Row 5: April 12 vs Oklahoma City\n- High Assists: Andre Miller with 7 assists.\n- High Points: Marcus Camby with 30 points.\n\nAgain, Brandon Roy did not lead in assists. The claim regarding leading assists fails here as well.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that:\n- Brandon Roy was the high scorer on April 3 (FALSE for being never the highest scorer).\n- He did not lead in assists in games on April 11 and April 12 (FALSE for leading assists in all five games).\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE based on both parts of it.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nFor completeness, here are the relevant cells where Brandon Roy's performance was compared:\n1.
