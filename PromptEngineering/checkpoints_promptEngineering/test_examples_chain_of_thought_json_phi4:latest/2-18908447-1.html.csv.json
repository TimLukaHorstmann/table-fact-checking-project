    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Jim Obradovich is true, we need to verify three components from the data provided:\n\n1. **Round of Pick**: The claim states that Jim Obradovich was picked after round 2.\n2. **Pick Number**: The pick number should be before pick 183.\n3. **Position Played**: Jim Obradovich plays as a tight end.\n\nLet's analyze each component step-by-step using the data from the table:\n\n1. **Round of Pick**:\n   - According to the claim, Jim Obradovich was picked after round 2.\n   - From the table, we see that Jim Obradovich is associated with row index 3 (0-based indexing) in the \"round\" column, and his value is 7. \n   - Since 7 is greater than 2, this condition is satisfied.\n\n2. **Pick Number**:\n   - The claim states that he was picked before pick 183.\n   - From the table, Jim Obradovich's pick number in row index 3 is 158.\n   - Since 158 is less than 183, this condition is also satisfied.\n\n3. **Position Played**:\n   - According to the claim, Jim Obradovich plays as a tight end.\n   - From the table, his position listed in row index 3 is \"tight end\".\n   - This matches exactly with what is stated in the claim.\n\nSince all three conditions from the claim are satisfied based on the data provided, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
