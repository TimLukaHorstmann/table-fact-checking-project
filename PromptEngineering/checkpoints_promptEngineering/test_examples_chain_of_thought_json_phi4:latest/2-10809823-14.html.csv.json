This means we are looking for a match between the name \"princes park\" in the \"venue\" column and checking if it appears as one of the venues used on the date \"28 June 1980\".\n\n2. **Examine Each Entry**: We need to verify each row in the data to see which venues were used on that specific date.\n\n3. **Identify Relevant Columns**:\n   - The \"venue\" column contains the names of the stadiums.\n   - The \"date\" column confirms if the match occurred on \"28 June 1980\".\n\n4. **Check Each Row**:\n   - Row 1: Venue is \"kardinia park\", Date is \"28 june 1980\".\n   - Row 2: Venue is \"western oval\", Date is \"28 june 1980\".\n   - Row 3: Venue is \"princes park\", Date is \"28 june 1980\".
