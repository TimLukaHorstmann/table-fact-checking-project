We will look for the row where this value is `1`.\n\n3. **Check Home Team in Round 1:**\n   - Once we identify the row corresponding to round 1, we need to check the value under the \"home team\" column.\n\n4. **Verify Claim Against Data:**\n   - If the home team listed for round 1 matches \"pohang steelers\", then the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\n### Examination of Table\n\n- **Row with Round 1:**\n  - Row index `0` has:\n    - \"round\": `1`\n    - \"home team\": `\"pohang steelers\"`\n\n- **Verification:**\n  - The home team listed for round 1 is indeed \"pohang steelers\".\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim that \"the home team pohang steelers play in round 1\" is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n- Row index `0`, Column name `\"round\"`: Value is `1`\n- Row index `0`, Column name `\"home team\"`: Value is `\"pohang steelers\"`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim, locate the row where 'round' equals 1.
