    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"don't stop the train, record in 1985 never hit the us dance list\" is true or false, we need to analyze the data provided in the table for any mention of the song \"don't stop the train\" in the year 1985 and its position on the US Dance chart.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information**: We are interested in entries related to the single \"don't stop the train\" and the year 1985.\n   \n2. **Check for \"don't stop the train\" in 1985**:\n   - Look through the data rows to see if there is an entry where both the \"single\" column has \"don't stop the train\" and the \"year\" column is 1985.\n\n3. **Examine Entries for Each Year**:\n   - **Row 1**: The year is 1981, and the single is \"don't stop the train\". This does not match our criteria of being in 1985.\n   - **Row 2**: The year is 1985, but the single is \"move closer\", which does not match \"don't stop the train\".\n   - **Row 3**: The year is 1985, and the single is \"i don't know\". This also does not match our criteria.\n   - **Row 4**: Again, the year is 1985, but the single is \"i like you\", which is not relevant to us.\n   - **Row 5**: The year is 1994, with the single as \"move closer (re-issue)\", which again does not match our criteria.\n\n4. **Conclusion on Presence in 1985**:\n   - There are no entries for \"don't stop the train\" in the year 1985 in the given data.\n\n5. **Check US Dance Chart Position for 1981 Entry**:\n   - In Row 1, where \"don't stop the train\" is listed (year 1981), it has a position of \"20\" on the US Dance chart.\n   - Since there are no entries for \"don't stop the train\" in 1985, we only have information about its presence in 1981.\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that \"don't stop the train, record in 1985 never hit the us dance list.\" \n   - Since there is no entry for \"don't stop the train\" in 1985 at all, it indeed did not appear on the US Dance chart in 1985.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The data table was examined for any entries related to 'don't stop the train' in the year 1985.
