    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"8 of the picked players shown in the table play a position other than centre\" is true or false, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Players' Positions**: We need to go through each entry in the data column under the \"position\" field.\n\n2. **Count Centers and Non-Centers**:\n   - Count how many players are listed as playing the position of \"centre\".\n   - Subtract this count from the total number of players to find out how many play positions other than centre.\n\n3. **Verify Claim**: The claim states that 8 players play a position other than centre. We need to verify if our calculated number matches this.\n\n4. **Output Relevant Data**: Identify and list relevant rows where players are not playing as \"centre\" for verification purposes.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n- **Total Players**: There are 18 players in the table (from pick 127 to 144).\n\n- **Count Centers**:\n  - Timothy Hanley (pick 129) is a centre.\n  - Joseph McInnis (pick 130) is a centre.\n  - Mike Stapleton (pick 132) is a centre.\n  - Luciano Borsato (pick 135) is a centre.\n  - Blaine Chrest (pick 136) is a centre.\n  - Kevan Melrose (pick 138) is a defence (not centre).\n  - Vladimir Kyhos (pick 139) is a left wing (not centre).\n  - Thomas Hussey (pick 140) is a left wing (not centre).\n  - Henrik Cedegren (pick 141) is a right wing (not centre).\n  - Timo Iljima (pick 143) is a centre.\n  - Mark Thietke (pick 145) is a centre.\n\n- **Centres Total**: There are 6 players playing as \"centre\".\n\n- **Non-Centers Total**: Since there are 18 players in total and 6 play as centres, the number of players who do not play as centres is \\(18 - 6 = 12\\).\n\n- **Verification**: The claim states that 8 players play a position other than centre. However, we found that 12 players play positions other than centre.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there are actually 12 players playing positions other than centre, not 8.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, count the total number of players listed in the table (18).
