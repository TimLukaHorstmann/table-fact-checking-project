This can be done by checking the \"date\" column for each row.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - For each row with the date \"6 july 1968\", check both the \"home team\" and \"away team\" columns to see if \"footscray\" is listed as an away team.\n   \n3. **Row-by-Row Analysis**:\n   - **Row 1**: Date is \"6 july 1968\". Home team: \"st kilda\", Away team: \"south melbourne\". Footscray is not the away team.\n   - **Row 2**: Date is \"6 july 1968\". Home team: \"fitzroy\", Away team: \"melbourne\".
