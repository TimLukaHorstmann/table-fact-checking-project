We do not have data on who performed at each position or their names.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The table confirms that for the Rolling Stones theme, the order was indeed 6.\n   - Without additional context about contestants' names in the table, we cannot verify if Katie was specifically number 6 based solely on this table.\n   - Therefore, while the order is correct, there is no information confirming Katie's position.\n\nBased on these steps, the claim lacks sufficient evidence to be confirmed as true due to missing contestant name data.
