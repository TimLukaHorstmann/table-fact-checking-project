We will focus on:\n- The \"december\" column to find games played on December 21st.\n- The \"opponent\" column to identify games against the Cleveland Barons or Philadelphia Flyers.\n- The \"score\" column to verify if any game had a score where the Cleveland Barons scored zero goals.\n\n### Step 3: Examine Entries for December 21st\nLook at the table entries with December = 21:\n- Row 29 has a date of December 18th, which does not match.\n- Row 31 shows \"december\" as 21 and lists the opponent as \"cleveland barons\".\n\n### Step 4: Check the Score for Cleveland Barons on December 21st\nIn row 31:\n- The score is listed as \"4 - 0\".\n- This means the team played against the Cleveland Barons, and their opponent scored 4 goals while the Cleveland Barons scored 0.\n\n### Step 5: Verify Opponent Against Claim\nThe claim involves a game between the Cleveland Barons and the Philadelphia Flyers. However, in row 31:\n- The opponent is \"cleveland barons\", but there's no mention of the Philadelphia Flyers.\n- This means there was indeed a game against the Cleveland Barons on December 21st where they scored 0 goals, but it did not involve the Philadelphia Flyers.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nThe claim specifies that the game should be between the Cleveland Barons and the Philadelphia Flyers. The table shows a game with the Cleveland Barons on December 21st, but no evidence of a match against the Philadelphia Flyers.
