However, the table does not explicitly mention series numbers but rather provides an episode number (e.g., no overall) and a series-specific number (no for series).\n   \n5. **Verify Episode Numbers for David Moore:**\n   - Check which episodes correspond to his direction by examining the \"no for series\" column.\n   - This will help us understand if these episodes are indeed part of what might be considered \"series 2\".\n\n6. **Conclusion Based on Data:**\n   - If \"David Moore\" directed exactly 3 episodes and they match the series number implied in the claim, then the statement is true.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Row 1:** \"The curse of cornelius sigan\", Directed by David Moore.\n- **Row 4:** \"Lancelot and guinevere\", Directed by David Moore.\n- **Row 5:** \"Beauty and the beast (part 1)\", Directed by David Moore.\n\nThese three entries show that David Moore directed episodes with series numbers 1, 4, and 5. Since these are consecutive within a sequence starting from 1, it implies they belong to a single series segment.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- **Number of Episodes:** David Moore directed 3 episodes.\n- **Series Consistency:** These episodes (1, 4, 5) appear consecutively in the \"no for series\" column, indicating they are part of one continuous series segment.
