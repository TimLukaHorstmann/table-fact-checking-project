    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table for the entry with a specific \"rating / share (18 - 49)\" value of \"3.2 / 8\" and verify its associated viewership.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Column:**\n   - The column named \"rating / share (18 - 49)\" contains the data we are interested in, as it provides information about different ratings and shares.\n\n2. **Locate Entries with Specific Value:**\n   - We need to find entries where the value is exactly \"3.2 / 8\".\n\n3. **Check for Corresponding Viewership:**\n   - Once identified, look at the \"viewers (millions)\" column for these specific entries to determine if their viewership exceeds 12.42 million.\n\n4. **Evaluate Each Relevant Entry:**\n\n   - **Row Index 5**:\n     - \"rating / share (18 - 49)\": \"3.2 / 8\"\n     - \"viewers (millions)\": 12.42\n     - This entry exactly matches the viewership of 12.42 million, not more.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - There is no entry with a \"rating / share (18 - 49)\" of \"3.2 / 8\" that has more than 12.42 million viewers.\n   \nBased on this analysis, the claim that there are more than 12.42 million viewers for an entry with \"rating / share (18 - 49)\" as \"3.2 / 8\" is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the 'rating / share (18 - 49)' column and located entries with value '3.2 / 8'.
