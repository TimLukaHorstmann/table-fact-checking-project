    "resp": "To determine if the claim about April 18th having a score higher than \"W 109 - 101 (OT)\" is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Date of Interest:**\n   The claim concerns games on \"April 18.\" Thus, we must identify whether there are any game records for this specific date in the provided data.\n\n2. **Examine Data Entries for April 18:**\n   Review each row in the data to see if any have a date of \"April 18.\"\n\n3. **Determine Presence or Absence:**\n   If no games are recorded on April 18, it means there is no score to compare with \"W 109 - 101 (OT).\" Therefore, we cannot say that an unspecified game has a higher score than one without any record.\n\n4. **Compare the Specified Score:**\n   The specified score in question is \"W 109 - 101 (OT),\" which occurred on April 8 against Atlanta. We need to determine if there's a game on April 18 with a higher score for our team, but as established, no such record exists.\n\n5. **Conclude the Claim:**\n   Since there are no games listed on April 18, it is impossible for any game on that date to have a score higher than \"W 109 - 101 (OT)\" because there is no data or score present.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim that \"April 18 has the score higher than W 109 - 101 (OT)\" is false as there are no records of games played on April 18 in the provided dataset.
