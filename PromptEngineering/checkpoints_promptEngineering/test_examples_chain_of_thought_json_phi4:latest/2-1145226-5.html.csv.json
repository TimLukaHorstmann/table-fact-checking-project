Thus, he may still be playing.\n   - **Chris Wyles**: The span is \"2007 -\", suggesting an ongoing period without a specified end date. Therefore, he may still be playing.\n   - **David Fee**: The span is \"2002 - 2005\", indicating he finished his play by the year 2005.\n   - **Mike Hercus**: The span is \"2002 - 2009\", indicating he finished his play by the year 2009.\n   - **Riaan van Zyl**: The span is \"2003 - 2004\", suggesting he finished his play in 2004.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Players Todd Clever, Takudzwa Ngwenya, and Chris Wyles have spans that are still ongoing (\"2003 -\" or \"2007 -\").
