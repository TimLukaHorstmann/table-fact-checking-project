However, based on our analysis:\n\n- Vit\u00f3ria is over capacity (not under), at 222.5%.\n- It does not have the highest annual change; Bras\u00edlia has 45.1%.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nFor clarity and verification purposes, we refer to specific cells in this conclusion:\n- Capacity Usage for Vit\u00f3ria: Row 15, Column \"capacity in use\"\n- Annual Change for Vit\u00f3ria: Row 15, Column \"annual change\"\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, determine which airport is most under capacity by finding the lowest 'capacity in use' percentage.
