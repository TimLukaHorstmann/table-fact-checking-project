    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze the data provided in the table for several key aspects:\n\n1. **Identify Jefferson's Losses:**\n   - We are interested in games where \"jefferson\" was noted as the losing pitcher.\n   - From the data:\n     - June 1: \"mariners\", loss by \"jefferson (0 - 5)\"\n     - June 12: \"mariners\", loss by \"jefferson (1 - 6)\"\n     - June 22: \"red sox\", loss by \"jefferson (1 - 7)\"\n\n2. **Check Opponents for These Losses:**\n   - For each game where Jefferson was the losing pitcher, we need to check against whom they played:\n     - June 1: Against \"mariners\"\n     - June 12: Against \"mariners\"\n     - June 22: Against \"red sox\"\n\n3. **Check for Games Against Blue Jays:**\n   - The claim specifies losses against the \"blue jay\" (now known as the Toronto Blue Jays).\n   - There are no entries in the table for games played against the \"Blue Jays.\" Therefore, there are zero recorded losses against them.\n\n4. **Verify the Month and Opponent Information:**\n   - All relevant data is from June.\n   - The claim incorrectly specifies the opponent as the \"blue jay,\" while none of Jefferson's June losses were to this team according to the table.\n\n5. **Season Verification (1979):**\n   - While the season year (1979) isn't directly mentioned in the table, it's implied by the context of the problem statement.\n   - Since the data matches up with known historical records for that era, we assume this is accurate. However, our focus is on matchups and losses.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Jefferson has no recorded losses to the Blue Jays in June based on the provided table.\n   - The claim states three such losses which do not exist.\n\nBased on these analyses:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify games where Jefferson was the losing pitcher.\",\n    \"Check opponents for each game involving a loss by Jefferson.\",\n    \"Verify if any of these opponents are the 'Blue Jays'.\",\n    \"Determine the number of losses against Blue Jays in June, which is zero.\",\n    \"Conclude that the claim of three losses to Blue Jays is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"loss\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Common notations include \"(10)\" to indicate ten innings, \"(11)\" for eleven innings, and so on.\n\n2. **Examine Each Game in June 1979:**\n   - We will go through each row of data under the \"date\" column for games played in June 1979 and check if there is any indication of extra innings in the \"score\" column.\n\n3. **List Games with Extra Innings:**\n   - **June 13 vs. Angels:** The score is \"10 - 2\". There's no indication of extra innings.\n   - **June 20 vs. Yankees:** Two games are listed on this date:\n     - First game score is \"2 - 1\" (no extra inning notation).\n     - Second game score is \"3 - 2\" (no extra inning notation).\n   - **June 21 vs. Yankees:** Score is \"3 - 1\" (no extra inning notation).\n   - **June 23 vs. Red Sox:** Score is \"4 - 3 (11)\" indicating the game went into eleven innings.\n   - **June 28 vs. Yankees:** Score is \"5 - 3 (10)\" indicating the game went into ten innings.\n\n4. **Count Extra Inning Games:**\n   - From the analysis, we identified two games that went into extra innings:\n     - June 23 against the Red Sox (\"4 - 3 (11)\")\n     - June 28 against the Yankees (\"5 - 3 (10)\")\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states there were \"3 game[s] that go into extra inning in june of 1979\".
