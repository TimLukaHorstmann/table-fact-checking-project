    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about series number 56's title is true, we need to analyze the provided table data step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Series Number 56:**\n   - We are given that \"no in series\" corresponds to individual episode numbers.\n   - Locate entry where \"no in series\" equals 56.\n\n2. **Extract Title for Series Number 56:**\n   - Find the title corresponding to \"no in series\" = 56.\n\n3. **Verify Against Claimed Title:**\n   - The claim states that the title should be \"the case of the miss diary\".\n   - Compare this with the extracted title from step 2.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - If the titles match, the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Locate the row where \"no in series\" = 56:\n  - Row index for this entry is 11 (0-based index).\n\n- Extract the title from this row:\n  - The title at \"row_index\" 11 and column \"title\" is \"sister act\".\n\n- Compare with claimed title:\n  - Claimed title: \"the case of the miss diary\"\n  - Actual title: \"sister act\"\n\n- Conclusion:\n  - Since \"sister act\" does not match \"the case of the miss diary\", the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cell for verification is at row index 11, column \"title\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
