This indicates a double header.\n   - On September 14, there are also two games against the Brewers labeled as \"dh - 1\" and \"dh - 2\", indicating another double header.\n\n2. **Check for Three Consecutive Days of Games**:\n   - We need to find sequences where games occur on three consecutive days without a rest day in between.\n   - Look at the sequence from September 11 to September 13:\n     - September 11: Game against Brewers\n     - September 12: Game postponed (not played)\n     - September 13: Game against Brewers\n   - This is not three consecutive days of games due to the postponement on September 12.\n   - Look at the sequence from September 16 to September 18:\n     - September 16: Game against Braves\n     - September 17: Game against Braves\n     - September 18: Game against Braves\n   - This is a valid sequence of three consecutive days with games played each day.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The Phillies played two double headers on September 7 and September 14.\n- They also played games on three consecutive days from September 16 to September 18.\n\nThus, the claim that \"during the 2008 season the Philadelphia Phillies play 2 double header, play 2 game on 3 day\" is true.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify double headers by checking for two games on the same date with an opponent.\",\n    \"Found double headers on September 7 (Mets) and September 14 (Brewers).\",\n    \"Check sequences of three consecutive days for games without a rest day in between.\",\n    \"Found three consecutive days of games from September 16 to September 18 (Braves).\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 45, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 46, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 47, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 48, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
