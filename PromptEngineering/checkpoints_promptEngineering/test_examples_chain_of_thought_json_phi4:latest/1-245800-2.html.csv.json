Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Crew Members for Soyuz T-4:**\n   - Examine the table data to locate the entry where \"flight up\" is \"Soyuz T-4\".\n   - According to the table, this corresponds to the expedition \"Salyut 6 - EO - 6\", with crew members listed as \"Vladimir Kovalyonok, Viktor Savinykh\".\n\n2. **Check for Yuri Romanenko in Soyuz T-4:**\n   - From the identified crew for Soyuz T-4 (\"Vladimir Kovalyonok, Viktor Savinykh\"), confirm whether Yuri Romanenko is a member.\n   - Yuri Romanenko is not listed as part of this crew.\n\n3. **Identify Crew Members for Soyuz T-6:**\n   - Examine the table to find any entry where \"flight up\" is \"Soyuz T-6\".\n   - No entries in the table list \"Soyuz T-6\" under the \"flight up\" column, indicating there was no such mission recorded.\n\n4. **Check for Yuri Romanenko in Soyuz T-6:**\n   - Since there is no Soyuz T-6 flight listed, there are no crew members to consider.\n   - Consequently, Yuri Romanenko cannot be a member of the nonexistent \"flight up Soyuz T-6\" crew.\n\n5. **Conclusion on the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Yuri Romanenko was part of both the \"Soyuz T-4\" and \"Soyuz T-6\" crews (for flight up).\n   - As established, he is not a member of the Soyuz T-4 crew, nor could he be a member of the non-existent Soyuz T-6 crew.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Locate the entry for 'flight up' Soyuz T-4 in the table.\",\n    \"Identify the crew members for Soyuz T-4 as Vladimir Kovalyonok and Viktor Savinykh.\",\n    \"Confirm that Yuri Romanenko is not listed among them.\",\n    \"Search for any entry with 'flight up' Soyuz T-6 in the table.\",\n    \"Determine there are no entries for 'Soyuz T-6', indicating it did not exist.\",\n    \"Conclude that Yuri Romanenko cannot be a member of a non-existent crew.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"flight up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"crew\"},\n    {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"flight up\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
