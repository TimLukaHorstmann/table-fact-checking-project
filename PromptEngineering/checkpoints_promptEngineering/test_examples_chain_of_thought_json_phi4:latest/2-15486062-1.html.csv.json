The highest attendance was 85,112 at an away game in Washington.\n2. The best-attended home game had just 64,104 fans.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n- **Identify all attendance values and corresponding details:**  \n  We will review each row of the data to extract the attendance figures along with the opponent and result (to determine if it was a home or away game).\n\n- **Find the highest attendance:**  \n  - Row index 11 shows an attendance of 85,112 against the Washington Redskins. The result is \"w 20 - 14,\" indicating this was a home game (since they won).\n  - Therefore, the claim that the highest attendance was at an away game in Washington is incorrect.\n\n- **Identify all home games and their attendances:**  \n  Home games are identified by wins or losses where there's no indication of being played away. From the data:\n    - Row index 5: Attendance = 63,941 (win against Washington Redskins)\n    - Row index 12: Attendance = 85,112 (win against Washington Redskins)\n    - Row index 13: Attendance = 61,821 (win against New York Giants)\n    - Row index 16: Attendance = 64,366 (win against San Francisco 49ers)\n\n- **Determine the best-attended home game:**  \n  The highest attendance for a home game is 85,112 at row index 12. Therefore, the claim that the best-attended home game had just 64,104 fans is incorrect.\n\n**Relevant cells:**\n- Row 11, \"attendance\" = 85112\n- Row 12, \"attendance\" = 85112 (home game)\n- Row 5, \"attendance\" = 63941 (home game)\n- Row 13, \"attendance\" = 61821 (home game)\n- Row 16, \"attendance\" = 64366 (home game)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe claim is FALSE because the highest attendance was for a home game in Washington, not an away game.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"there be never more than 80000 in attendance during the 2001 Dallas Cowboys' season\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to carefully analyze the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The statement suggests that no game had an attendance greater than 80,000 during this specific season for the Dallas Cowboys.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**: We will examine the \"attendance\" column in each row of the data to see if there are any values exceeding 80,000.\n\n3. **Examine Each Entry**:\n   - Row 1: Attendance is 61,521.\n   - Row 2: Attendance is 63,430.\n   - Row 3: Attendance is 66,621.\n   - Row 4: Attendance is 61,535.\n   - Row 5: Attendance is 63,941.\n   - Row 7: Attendance is 63,114.\n   - Row 8: Attendance is 78,673 (this is below 80,000).\n   - Row 9: Attendance is 69,010.\n   - Row 10: Attendance is 63,204.\n   - Row 11: Attendance is 64,104.\n   - **Row 12**: Attendance is 85,112. This value exceeds 80,000.\n   - Row 13: Attendance is 61,821.\n   - Row 14: Attendance is 63,366.\n   - Row 15: Attendance is 48,883.\n   - Row 16: Attendance is 64,366.\n   - Row 17: Attendance is 77,512.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The claim is FALSE because there was one game in the season (row 12) with an attendance of 85,112, which exceeds 80,000.\n\n5. **Relevant Cell Identification**:\n   - The relevant cell that contradicts the claim is located at row index 11 for the \"attendance\" column.\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that no game had an attendance greater than 80,000 during the season. By examining each entry in the 'attendance' column, it was found that Row 12 has an attendance of 85,112, which is above 80,000.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the 2001 Dallas Cowboys is true, we need to verify two conditions: they won two November games and lost two November games.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify November Games**: \n   - Look for all entries in the data where the month of the date is \"November\". The relevant columns are \"week\", \"date\", \"opponent\", \"result\", and \"attendance\".\n\n2. **Count Wins and Losses**:\n   - For each November game, check the \"result\" column to determine if it was a win (denoted by \"w\") or a loss (denoted by \"l\").\n\n3. **Verify Claim Conditions**:\n   - Ensure there are exactly two wins (\"w\") in November.\n   - Ensure there are exactly two losses (\"l\") in November.\n\n### Analysis of Data:\n\n- **November 4, 2001**: \n  - Result: \"l 27 - 24\" (Loss)\n  \n- **November 11, 2001**:\n  - Result: \"l 20 - 13\" (Loss)\n\n- **November 18, 2001**:\n  - Result: \"l 36 - 3\" (Loss)\n\n- **November 22, 2001**:\n  - Result: \"l 26 - 24\" (Loss)\n\nFrom the analysis:\n\n- There are four games in November.\n- All four games resulted in losses (\"l\").\n- There are no wins (\"w\") in November.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that the 2001 Dallas Cowboys won two November games and lost two is false. They did not win any games in November; they only had losses.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified all November games from the data.
