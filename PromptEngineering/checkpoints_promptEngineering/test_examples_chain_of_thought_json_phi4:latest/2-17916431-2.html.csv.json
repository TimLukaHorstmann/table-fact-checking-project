We will verify these counts against the data.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n- **Matches Ending in \"0 - 0\":**\n  - Game 17 (27 January 2009, Home vs. Darlington)\n  - Game 22 (14 February 2009, Home vs. Wycombe Wanderers)\n  - Game 28 (31 January 2009, Home vs. Grimsby Town)\n  - Game 39 (21 March 2009, Home vs. Port Vale)\n  - Game 40 (28 March 2009, Away vs. Chester City)\n\n  Total: 5 matches with a result of \"0 - 0\".\n\n- **Matches Ending in \"5 - 0\":**\n  - Game 35 (3 March 2009, Home vs. Aldershot Town)\n\n  Total: 1 match with a result of \"5 - 0\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states there are 5 matches ending in \"0 - 0\" and 3 matches ending in \"5 - 0\".
