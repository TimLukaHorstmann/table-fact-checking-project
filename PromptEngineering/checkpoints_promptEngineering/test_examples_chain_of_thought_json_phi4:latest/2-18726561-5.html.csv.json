There are no ties numbered higher than 8 or below 1.\n\nLet's analyze each point step by step using the data provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n#### Check Dates\nWe need to ensure all game dates fall within the range from 14 February 1976 to 23 February 1976, inclusive. We will examine the \"date\" column for each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Date is \"14 february 1976\". This falls on or after 14 February 1976.\n2. **Row 1**: Date is \"14 february 1976\". This also falls on or after 14 February 1976.\n3. **Replay Row (2)**: Date is \"18 february 1976\". This date falls within the range.\n4. **Replay Row (3)**: Date is \"23 february 1976\". This is on or before 23 February 1976.\n5. **Row 4**: Date is \"14 february 1976\". Falls on or after 14 February 1976.\n6. **Replay Row (5)**: Date is \"17 february 1976\". Within the range.\n7. **Row 6**: Date is \"14 february 1976\". Falls on or after 14 February 1976.\n8. **Row 7**: Date is \"23 february 1976\". On or before 23 February 1976.\n9. **Row 8**: Date is \"14 february 1976\". Falls on or after 14 February 1976.\n10. **Replay Row (9)**: Date is \"17 february 1976\". Within the range.\n\nAll dates fall within the specified range from 14 February 1976 to 23 February 1976, inclusive.\n\n#### Check Tie Numbers\nNext, we need to ensure that all tie numbers are between 1 and 8, inclusive. We will check the \"tie no\" column for each row:\n\n- **Rows with Ties**:\n  - Row 0: Tie number is \"1\".\n  - Row 1: Tie number is \"2\".\n  - Replay Rows (2 & 3): No tie number.\n  - Row 4: Tie number is \"3\".\n  - Replay Row (5): No tie number.\n  - Row 6: Tie number is \"5\".\n  - Row 7: Tie number is \"6\".\n  - Row 8: Tie number is \"7\".\n  - Replay Row (9): No tie number.\n\nAll specified tie numbers are within the range from 1 to 8. There are no tie numbers below 1 or above 8.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied:\n\n- All game dates fall between 14 February 1976 and 23 February 1976, inclusive.\n- Tie numbers do not exceed 8 nor go below 1.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"All game dates are checked to ensure they fall on or after 14 February 1976 and on or before 23 February 1976.\",\n    \"Date of each row is verified: Rows 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8 on 14 February 1976; Replay rows (2, 3, 5, 9) from 18 to 17 February fall within the range; Row 3 and 7 on 23 February 1976.\",\n    \"Checked tie numbers: Rows with ties have numbers between 1 and 8 inclusive.
