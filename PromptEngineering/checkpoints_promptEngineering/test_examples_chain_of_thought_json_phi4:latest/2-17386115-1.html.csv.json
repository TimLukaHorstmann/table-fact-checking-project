    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"ken irvin be drag in the fourth round\" is TRUE or FALSE, let's follow these reasoning steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The phrase \"be drag\" could imply selection in a specific manner related to the draft process, but typically in sports drafts, it means being selected or picked.\n\n2. **Identify Key Information**: We need to verify if Ken Irvin was indeed selected during the fourth round of this draft.\n\n3. **Locate Ken Irvin's Entry**:\n   - Look through the data for an entry where \"player\" is \"ken irvin\".\n\n4. **Check Round and Pick Details**:\n   - Verify the \"round\" value associated with Ken Irvin to ensure it corresponds to the fourth round.\n   - Confirm that he was indeed picked in this round.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Entry**:\n   - The entry for Ken Irvin is: `[4, 109, \"ken irvin\", \"defensive back\", \"memphis\"]`.\n   - This indicates that Ken Irvin was selected in the fourth round (round = 4) with pick number 109.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the data, Ken Irvin was indeed picked in the fourth round, confirming the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's format this reasoning into a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim 'ken irvin be drag in the fourth round' implies that Ken Irvin was selected during the fourth round.
