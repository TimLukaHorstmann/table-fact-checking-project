    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about viewership numbers is true, we need to evaluate each part of the statement against the data provided in the table.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify Episodes Mentioned in Claim:**  \n   The claim states that four episodes tied for most-watched at 5.7 million viewers. These episodes are:\n   - \"those lazy - hazy - crazy days\"\n   - \"they shoot gilmores, don't they?\"\n   - \"let the games begin\"\n   - \"the big one\"\n\n2. **Locate Each Episode in the Table:**\n   We will find each episode's row by matching titles and check their viewership numbers.\n   \n3. **Check Viewership Numbers:**\n\n   - **\"those lazy - hazy - crazy days\":**  \n     This is located at:\n     - Row 44 (Episode 1), with US viewers = 5.7 million.\n\n   - **\"they shoot gilmores, don't they?\":**\n     This is found at:\n     - Row 50 (Episode 7), with US viewers = 5.7 million.\n   \n   - **\"let the games begin\":**  \n     Check this in:\n     - Row 51 (Episode 8), with US viewers = 5.7 million.\n   \n   - **\"the big one\":**\n     This is located at:\n     - Row 59 (Episode 16), with US viewers = 5.7 million.\n\n4. **Verify that No Other Episode Exceeds or Ties These Viewership Numbers:**\n   We need to ensure no other episode has 5.7 million viewers.\n   \n   - Review the \"us viewers (million)\" column for all episodes:\n     - Episodes with exactly 5.7 million viewers are:\n       - Row 44 (\"those lazy - hazy - crazy days\")\n       - Row 50 (\"they shoot gilmores, don't they?\")\n       - Row 51 (\"let the games begin\")\n       - Row 59 (\"the big one\")\n\n   No other episode has exactly 5.7 million viewers.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim that four episodes are tied for most-watched at 5.7 million viewers is accurate based on our analysis of the table data.
