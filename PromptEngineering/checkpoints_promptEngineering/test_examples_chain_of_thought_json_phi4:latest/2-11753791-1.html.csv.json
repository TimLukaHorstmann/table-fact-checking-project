    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the team with 3 losses have 0 tie\" is TRUE or FALSE, let's analyze the provided table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Teams with 3 Losses**: \n   - The column of interest for identifying teams with 3 losses is \"losses\".\n   - We need to locate all rows in the data where the value in the \"losses\" column is 3.\n\n2. **Check for Ties**:\n   - For each team identified in step 1, check the \"ties\" column.\n   - Determine if the number of ties is 0.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - If all teams with 3 losses have 0 ties, then the claim is TRUE.\n   - If any team with 3 losses has a non-zero number of ties, then the claim is FALSE.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the table:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - \"Montreal Hockey Club\": Losses = 3, Ties = 0\n- **Row 2**:\n  - \"Ottawa Hockey Club\": Losses = 3, Ties = 0\n- **Row 3**:\n  - \"Montreal Victorias\": Losses = 3, Ties = 0\n- **Row 4**:\n  - \"Quebec Hockey Club\": Losses = 3, Ties = 0\n\nAll teams with 3 losses have 0 ties.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is TRUE because every team listed with 3 losses also has 0 ties.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
