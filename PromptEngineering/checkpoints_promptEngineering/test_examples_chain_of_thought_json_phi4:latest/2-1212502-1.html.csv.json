The relevant column here is \"year\" as it will allow us to filter out rows that match 2012.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Entries with Year 2012:**\n   - We need to find all rows where the value in the \"year\" column is 2012.\n   \n2. **Check Results for These Entries:**\n   - For each of these entries, examine the \"result\" column to determine if any have a result listed as \"nominated.\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Data:**\n   - From the provided data:\n     - There are two entries with the year 2012.\n     - The first entry is for \"teen choice award,\" category \"breakout star female,\" nominated work \"bunheads,\" and result \"nominated.\"\n     - The second entry is for \"critics' choice television award,\" category \"best actress in a comedy series,\" nominated work \"bunheads,\" but the result is not provided.
