We will look at the wins and losses for all entries:\n     - Game 31: \"6 - 25\" (Loss)\n     - Game 32: \"7 - 25\" (Win)\n     - Game 33: \"7 - 26\" (Loss)\n     - Game 34: \"7 - 27\" (Loss)\n     - Game 35: \"7 - 28\" (Loss)\n     - Game 36: \"7 - 29\" (Loss)\n     - Game 37: \"7 - 30\" (Loss)\n     - Game 38: \"7 - 31\" (Loss)\n     - Game 39: \"8 - 31\" (Win)\n     - Game 40: \"8 - 32\" (Loss)\n     - Game 41: \"9 - 32\" (Win)\n     - Game 42: \"9 - 33\" (Loss)\n     - Game 43: \"9 - 34\" (Loss)\n     - Game 44: \"9 - 35\" (Loss)\n     - Game 45: \"9 - 36\" (Loss)\n     - Game 46: \"9 - 37\" (Loss)\n     - Game 47: \"10 - 37\" (Win)\n\n4. **Count Total Wins and Losses:**\n   - Count the total number of wins:\n     - Games with a win recorded in the record are: Game 32, Game 39, Game 41, and Game 47.\n     - Total Wins = 4\n   - Count the total number of losses:\n     - All other games (Games 31, 33-38, 40, 42-46) are losses.\n     - Total Losses = 13\n\n5. **Compare Wins and Losses:**\n   - The team has 4 wins and 13 losses.\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - Since there are more losses (13) than wins (4), the claim \"there be more loss than win during the season\" is true.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table's 'record' column shows the number of wins and losses after each game.
