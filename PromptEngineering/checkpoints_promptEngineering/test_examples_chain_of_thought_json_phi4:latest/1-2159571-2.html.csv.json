    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Isidore Dollinger (D) resigning his seat on December 31, 1959, is true or false, we will analyze the relevant data from the provided table.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data Row:**\n   - We need to locate the entry for \"Isidore Dollinger (D)\" in the table. This can be done by scanning through the `data` array in the JSON object for a row where the `vacator` is listed as \"isidore dollinger (d)\".\n\n2. **Check the Reason for Change:**\n   - Once we find the relevant row, we need to check the value under the column `\"reason for change\"`. This will tell us why Isidore Dollinger left his seat.\n\n3. **Verify the Date and Action:**\n   - According to the claim, the action is a \"resignation,\" which should be reflected in the reason for change as \"resigned\". Additionally, we need to confirm that this resignation occurred on December 31, 1959.\n\n4. **Analyze the Data:**\n   - From the table, we find the row with `\"vacator\": \"isidore dollinger (d)\"`.\n   - The corresponding `\"reason for change\"` is \"resigned december 31 , 1959\".\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the reason for Isidore Dollinger's departure from his seat matches the claim of resignation on December 31, 1959, the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant row in the table for this analysis is at `row_index` 8.\n- The relevant columns are `\"vacator\": \"isidore dollinger (d)\"`, and `\"reason for change\": \"resigned december 31 , 1959\"`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the entry for Isidore Dollinger in the table.
