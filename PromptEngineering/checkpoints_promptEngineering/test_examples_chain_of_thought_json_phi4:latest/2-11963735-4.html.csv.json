This means focusing on entries with \"nuggets\" (case insensitive) in the \"visitor\" or \"home\" columns.\n\n2. **Extract Attendance Data**: For each relevant game, extract the attendance figure from the \"attendance\" column.\n\n3. **Compare Attendances**:\n   - Look for games where the Nuggets played at home and note their attendances.\n   - Compare these figures to find the highest attendance for home games.\n   - Also consider away games to verify if there's a higher attendance than any home game, as specified in the claim about December 21 against the Trail Blazers.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim**: Check if the attendance on December 21 (against the Trail Blazers) is indeed the highest among all Nuggets' games in December 2007.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n- **Home Games Attendance**:\n  - 2 December: 16386\n  - 5 December: 19155\n  - 8 December: 15493\n  - 12 December: 13337\n  - 20 December: 16157\n  - 26 December: 18701\n\n- **Away Games Attendance**:\n  - 6 December: 20155 (against Mavericks)\n  - 21 December: 20644 (against Trail Blazers)\n  - 23 December: 15055 (against Kings)\n  - 28 December: 20001 (against Warriors)\n\n5. **Determine the Highest Attendance**: From the above data, the highest attendance figure is 20644 on December 21 against the Trail Blazers.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The claim states that the highest attendance was on December 21 at their away game against the Trail Blazers, which matches our analysis.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified all Nuggets games in December 2007, extracted attendance figures for both home and away games.
