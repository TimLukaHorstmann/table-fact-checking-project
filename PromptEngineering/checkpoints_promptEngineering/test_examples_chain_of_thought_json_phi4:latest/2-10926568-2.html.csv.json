This is found in row index 1 (second row of data).\n  - Check the value under `\"original airdate\"` for this row.\n\n- **Step 3**: Compare with the Claimed Date.\n  - The date listed for episode number 202 is \"February 4, 2008\".\n  - The claim states that episode number 202 aired on February 4, 2008.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe date in the table matches the claimed airdate.
