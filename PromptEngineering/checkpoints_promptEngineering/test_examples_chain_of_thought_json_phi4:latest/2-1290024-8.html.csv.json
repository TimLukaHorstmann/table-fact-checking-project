    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the class PP locomotive being the oldest made steam locomotive in Ireland, we need to verify its manufacturing dates against those of other classes listed in the table.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim:** The claim is that the \"class pp type 4 - 4 - 0\" is the oldest made steam locomotive in Ireland.\n\n2. **Locate Data for Class PP:**\n   - Locate the row corresponding to class \"pp\".\n   - Relevant data from this row:\n     - Date Made: \"1896 - 1911\"\n   \n3. **Check Other Classes for Earlier Dates:**\n   - Compare the manufacturing date of class pp with all other classes in the table.\n   - Look at the \"Date Made\" column for each entry to find any earlier dates than 1896.\n\n4. **Evaluate Each Class:**\n   - **Class PG:** \"1899 - 1904\"\n   - **Class Q:** \"1899 - 1904\"\n   - **Class QG:** \"1903 - 1904\"\n   - **Class P:** \"1904 - 1906\"\n   - **Class ql:** \"1904 - 1910\"\n   - **Class qgt:** \"1905\"\n   - **Class lqg:** \"1906 - 1908\"\n   - **Class rt:** \"1908 - 1911\"\n   - **Class nqg:** \"1911\"\n   - **Class nlqg:** \"1911\"\n   - **Class qgt2:** \"1911\"\n   - **Class s:** \"1913\"\n   - **Class sg:** \"1913\"\n\n5. **Determine the Earliest Date:**\n   - The earliest date found is 1896 from class pp.\n   - No other class has a manufacturing start year earlier than 1896.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe class PP with type 4 - 4 - 0 has the earliest manufacturing start year of 1896.

We will focus on rows where both these conditions are met.\n   \n2. **Locate Relevant Rows:**\n   - From the table, we locate:\n     - Row with index `1`: Class = \"pg\", Type = \"0 - 6 - 0\"\n\n3. **Check '1958 uta' Column for Each Relevant Row:**\n   - For row `1`, we check the value in the \"1958 uta\" column.\n   - The value is `\"7\"`.\n\n4. **Interpretation of '1958 uta':**\n   - The claim states that all makes should be incorporated into UTA, which implies the number in the \"1958 uta\" column should reflect this incorporation.\n   - A non-zero value (in this case, `7`) indicates that these locomotives were indeed incorporated into UTA.\n\n5. **Verify All Conditions:**\n   - Since there is only one row for class \"pg\" and type \"0 - 6 - 0\", and it has a non-zero value in the \"1958 uta\" column, all conditions of the claim are satisfied.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is true because all locomotives of class \"pg\" with type \"0 - 6 - 0\" have been incorporated into UTA as indicated by the non-zero value in the \"1958 uta\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
