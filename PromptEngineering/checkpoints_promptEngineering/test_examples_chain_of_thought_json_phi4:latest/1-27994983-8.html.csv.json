We need to locate this row in the data section of the table.\n\n2. **Locate the Row with Draw Number 3**:  \n   By examining the \"data\" array, we find that the third entry corresponds to:\n   ```json\n   [\n     3,\n     \"the moniker\",\n     \"oh my god!\",\n     \"daniel karlsson\",\n     55,\n     69,\n     124,\n     3\n   ]\n   ```\n   This row has a draw number of 3.\n\n3. **Check the Juries Value**:  \n   In this row, we look at the value under the \"juries\" column to see how many juries there are for draw number 3. The value is 55.\n\n4. **Compare with Claim**:  \n   The claim states that there should be 8 juries when the draw is 3. However, according to our examination of the table, there are actually 55 juries.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:  \n   Since the actual number of juries (55) does not match the claimed number (8), the statement is FALSE.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells**:  \n   The relevant cells for this verification include:\n   - Row with index 2 (since JSON arrays are zero-indexed, row \"3\" corresponds to index \"2\"), column \"draw\", which contains the value 3.\n   - Row with index 2, column \"juries\", which contains the value 55.\n\nNow we will format our conclusion and reasoning in a valid JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the row with draw number 3.
