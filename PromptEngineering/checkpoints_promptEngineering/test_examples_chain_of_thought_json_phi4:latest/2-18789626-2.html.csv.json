    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Winamac joined 10 years after Southwestern join\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the data from the table:\n\n1. **Identify relevant entries**:\n   - Look for the entry corresponding to \"Southwestern\":\n     - Row: `[[\"southwestern\", \"lafayette\", \"wildcats\", \"79 tippecanoe\", \"1958\", \"1966\"]]`\n     - Year Joined: 1958\n   - Look for the entry corresponding to \"Winamac\":\n     - Row: `[[\"winamac\", \"winamac\", \"warriors\", \"66 pulaski\", \"1947\", \"1972\"]]`\n     - Year Joined: 1947\n\n2. **Calculate the difference in years**:\n   - Southwestern joined in 1958.\n   - Winamac joined in 1947.\n   - Calculate the difference: \\(1958 - 1947 = 11\\) years.\n\n3. **Evaluate the claim**:\n   - The claim states that Winamac joined 10 years after Southwestern, but based on our calculation, Winamac actually joined 11 years before Southwestern.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is FALSE because the difference in joining years does not match the stated 10-year gap.\n\nRelevant cells for this analysis are:\n- \"southwestern\" entry: Year Joined (1958)\n- \"winamac\" entry: Year Joined (1947)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the year Southwestern joined from the table, which is 1958.\",\n    \"Identify the year Winamac joined from the table, which is 1947.\",\n    \"Calculate the difference in years between when Southwestern and Winamac joined: 1958 - 1947 = 11 years.\",\n    \"The claim states that Winamac joined 10 years after Southwestern.
