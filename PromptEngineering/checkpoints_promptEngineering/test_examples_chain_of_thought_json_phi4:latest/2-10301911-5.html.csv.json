The table provides a list of riders, their respective speeds, and other details.\n\n3. **Extract the Speed Value**: Once we locate the row for B\u00f6rje Jansson, extract the value in the \"speed\" column.\n\n4. **Compare with Claimed Value**: Compare the extracted speed value to the claimed speed of 90.57 mph.\n\n5. **Determine Truthfulness**: If the extracted speed matches the claimed speed, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- The data array in the table provides multiple rows with information about each rider.\n- We identify B\u00f6rje Jansson as appearing on row 8 (indexing starts from 0 in programming contexts, but here we use human-readable indexing starting from 1).\n- In this row, under the \"rider\" column, we find \"b\u00f6rje jansson\".\n- Next, check the \"speed\" column for B\u00f6rje Jansson's entry. It shows \"90.57 mph\".\n- The claimed speed in the statement is also \"90.57 mph\".\n\nSince the extracted speed value matches the claimed speed:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table contains a row for 'b\\u00f6rje jansson' at index 8.
