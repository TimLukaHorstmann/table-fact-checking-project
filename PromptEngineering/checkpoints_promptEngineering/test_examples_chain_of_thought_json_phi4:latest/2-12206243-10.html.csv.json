    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the September 1 game against the Mets is true or false, we need to verify two specific pieces of information from the table: the score of the game and the attendance.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Locate the Row for September 1**:\n   - The first step is to find the row in the data that corresponds to \"september 1\". We scan through each entry in the `data` array until we reach the one with the date \"september 1\".\n\n2. **Verify the Score**:\n   - Once we locate the row for September 1, we check the \"score\" column to see if it matches \"3 - 0\". This confirms whether the game was won with a score of 3-0.\n\n3. **Verify Attendance**:\n   - Next, we check the \"attendance\" column in the same row to ensure that the number matches 19196. This verifies the claimed attendance figure for the game.\n\n4. **Cross-Reference Record Update**:\n   - Although not directly mentioned in the claim, it's prudent to verify if the record updates correctly after this game. The initial record is \"65 - 71\" and a win would change it to \"66 - 71\", which matches the record given for September 2 (\"65 - 72\"), indicating one more loss.\n\n### Verification:\n\n- **Row Index**: The row corresponding to \"september 1\" is at index 0.\n- **Score Column**:\n  - Value: \"3 - 0\"\n  - This matches the claim of a win with a score of 3-0.\n- **Attendance Column**:\n  - Value: 19196\n  - This matches the claimed attendance figure.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBoth the score and the attendance match the details provided in the claim.
