    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Bolton Wanderers' scores being the same in both legs is true or false, let's follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Locate Bolton Wanderers' Match**:\n   - We need to find the row in the table where \"bolton wanderers\" appears as \"team 1\".\n   - In the data provided, Bolton Wanderers is listed in the third entry.\n\n2. **Extract Scores for Both Legs**:\n   - From the identified row, extract the scores for both the first and second legs.\n   - The scores are under the columns labeled \"1st leg\" and \"2nd leg\".\n\n3. **Compare the Scores**:\n   - Compare the score from the \"1st leg\" with the score from the \"2nd leg\".\n   - If they are identical, the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\n### Application to Bolton Wanderers\n\n- **Row Index**: 2 (third entry in zero-indexed data array)\n- **1st Leg Score**: \"1 - 1\"\n- **2nd Leg Score**: \"0 - 1\"\n\n**Comparison**:\n- The first leg score (\"1 - 1\") is not the same as the second leg score (\"0 - 1\").\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe scores for the two legs are different.
