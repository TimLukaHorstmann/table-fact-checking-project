Specifically, we will check if:\n\n1. Each season has less than 26 points.\n2. Each season has more than 18 games.\n3. Each season has exactly 13 losses.\n\nWe'll examine these criteria against each season's data in the table:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n#### For the 1977 Season:\n- **Points**: The row for 1977 shows \"points\" = 22, which is less than 26.\n- **Games**: The row for 1977 shows \"games\" = 24, which is more than 18.\n- **Losses**: The row for 1977 shows \"losses\" = 13, which matches the criterion of exactly 13 losses.\n\n#### For the 1978 Season:\n- **Points**: The row for 1978 shows \"points\" = 21, which is less than 26.\n- **Games**: The row for 1978 shows \"games\" = 24, which is more than 18.\n- **Losses**: The row for 1978 shows \"losses\" = 13, which matches the criterion of exactly 13 losses.\n\n#### For the 1989 Season:\n- **Points**: The row for 1989 shows \"points\" = 22, which is less than 26.\n- **Games**: The row for 1989 shows \"games\" = 24, which is more than 18.\n- **Losses**: The row for 1989 shows \"losses\" = 13, which matches the criterion of exactly 13 losses.\n\n### Conclusion\nAll parts of the claim are satisfied by each of the specified seasons: 1977, 1978, and 1989.
