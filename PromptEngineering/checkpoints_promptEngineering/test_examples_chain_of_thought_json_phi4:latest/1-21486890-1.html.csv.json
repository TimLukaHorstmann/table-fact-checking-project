    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into specific components and verify each one against the data provided in the table:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states:\n   - There should be a player who has \"185\" as the least number of matches.\n   - This player must have \"44\" as the number of times they were not out (\"not out\").\n   - Their career span should be from \"1984 - 1995\".\n\n2. **Identify Players with 185 Matches**: \n   - From the data, identify players who have played exactly 185 matches.\n\n3. **Check Not Out for These Players**:\n   - For each player identified in step 2, check if they were not out 44 times.\n\n4. **Verify Career Span**:\n   - Ensure that any player meeting the above conditions has a career span from \"1984 - 1995\".\n\n5. **Cross-Reference All Conditions**:\n   - Confirm all parts of the claim are satisfied by a single entry in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Players with 185 Matches**:\n   - Michael Hussey: Matches = 185\n\n2. **Check Not Out for These Players**:\n   - For Michael Hussey, \"not out\" is 44.\n\n3. **Verify Career Span**:\n   - Michael Hussey's career span is \"2004 - 2012\", which does not match the required \"1984 - 1995\".\n\nSince no player in the table has all three conditions (185 matches, 44 not outs, and a career from 1984 to 1995), the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For Michael Hussey (row_index 10):\n  - \"matches\": 185\n  - \"not out\": 44\n  - \"career\": \"2004 - 2012\"\n\nThus, no player satisfies all parts of the claim simultaneously.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify players with exactly 185 matches.
