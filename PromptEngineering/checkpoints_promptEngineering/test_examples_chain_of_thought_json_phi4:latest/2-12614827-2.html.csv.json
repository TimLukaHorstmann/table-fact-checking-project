Current record: 1-0.\n   - Row 2: Win against Savant Young. Current record: 2-0.\n   - Row 3: Loss to Justin Salas. Current record: 2-1.\n   - Row 4: Win against Eric Reynolds. Current record: 3-1.\n   - Row 5: Win against Rodney Rhoden. Current record: 4-1.\n   - Row 6: Loss to Nik Lentz. Current record: 4-2.\n   - Row 7: Win against Phillipe Nover. Current record: 5-2.\n   - Row 8: Loss to Rafael dos Anjos. Current record: 5-3.\n   - Row 9: Loss to Kurt Pellegrino. Current record: 5-4.\n   - Row 10: Win against Manny Gamburyan. Current record: 6-4.\n   - Row 11: Win against Keita Nakamura. Current record: 7-4.\n   - Row 12: No contest with Gray Maynard. Record remains 7-4.\n   - Row 13: Win against Kenji Arai.
