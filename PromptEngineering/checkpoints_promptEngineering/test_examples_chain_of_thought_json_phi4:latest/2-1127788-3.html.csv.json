    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"2000 be the only year Rafael M\u00e1rquez score more than 1 goal in international competition\" is true or false, we need to examine each entry in the table where goals were scored by Rafael M\u00e1rquez and check for any year other than 2000 where he scored more than one goal in a single match.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Entries with Goals:**\n   - We need to look at the \"goal\" column, as it represents each instance where Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored.\n   - The \"score\" column shows the individual game's scoreline for his team and the opponent, which helps identify if he scored more than one goal in a match.\n\n2. **Examine Each Entry:**\n   - Look at entries where the \"goal\" number indicates multiple goals by M\u00e1rquez within a single match.\n   - Specifically, check the \"score\" column to see if his team's score (the first number) minus his goals equals more than one goal in that match.\n\n3. **Yearly Analysis:**\n   - Check each entry for the year and determine if there are any years other than 2000 where M\u00e1rquez scored more than once in a single game.\n\n4. **Detailed Examination:**\n\n   - **Entry 1:** Date \"5 february 1999\", Score \"1 - 0\" (3 - 0), Competition \"1999 carlsberg cup\"\n     - He scored once (goal number 1).\n\n   - **Entry 2:** Date \"13 february 2000\", Score \"1 - 0\" (4 - 0), Competition \"2000 concacaf gold cup\"\n     - He scored once (goal number 2).\n\n   - **Entry 3:** Date \"3 september 2000\", Score \"5 - 1\" (7 - 1), Competition \"2002 world cup qualifier\"\n     - His team scored 5 goals, indicating he scored more than once. This is in the year 2000.\n\n   - **Entries 4 to 12:** Check each for multiple goals.\n     - Entry 4: Score \"2 - 1\", single goal (goal number 4).\n     - Entry 5: Score \"1 - 0\", single goal (goal number 5).\n     - Entry 6: Score \"3 - 0\", single goal (goal number 6).\n     - Entry 7: Score \"2 - 0\", single goal (goal number 7).\n     - Entry 8: Score \"1 - 0\", single goal (goal number 8).\n     - Entry 9: Score \"2 - 2\", single goal (goal number 9).\n     - Entry 10: Score \"2 - 0\", single goal (goal number 10).\n     - Entry 11: Score \"1 - 1\", no goals scored by M\u00e1rquez.\n     - Entry 12: Score \"1 - 0\" (4 - 1), single goal (goal number 12).\n\n   - **Entry 13:** Date \"30 october 2013\", Score \"1 - 0\" (4 - 2), Competition \"friendly\"\n     - His team scored 4 goals, indicating he scored more than once.

We need to identify all instances in 2000 from the table and check if there are any matches where he scored more than once.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - Look for rows with the \"date\" column that falls within the year 2000.\n   - Check the \"score\" column to see how many goals M\u00e1rquez scored in those matches.\n\n3. **Analyze Each Row**:\n   - **Row 2**: \n     - Date: 13 February 2000\n     - Score: 1 - 0 (M\u00e1rquez scored 1 goal)\n     - Result: 4 - 0\n     - Competition: 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup\n\n   This row indicates that on this date, M\u00e1rquez scored exactly one goal.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - From the data provided, there is only one instance in 2000 where M\u00e1rquez scored a goal (Row 2).\n   - There are no other entries for the year 2000.\n   - Therefore, he did not score more than one goal in any international competition in 2000.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in international competitions in 2000.

We need to check if he scored.\n   - Since the \"result\" does not specify which team or player scored, we look at the \"goal\" column for confirmation. Entry at `row_index` 10 has a \"goal\" value of 11, but there is no direct indication in this row that Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Rafael M\u00e1rquez did score in the 2006 FIFA World Cup (entry at `row_index` 7).\n   - There is no evidence from the table that Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored during the 2010 FIFA World Cup (entry at `row_index` 10).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe claim \"Rafael M\u00e1rquez score a goal at the 2006, but remain scoreless during the 2010 FIFA World Cup\" is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
