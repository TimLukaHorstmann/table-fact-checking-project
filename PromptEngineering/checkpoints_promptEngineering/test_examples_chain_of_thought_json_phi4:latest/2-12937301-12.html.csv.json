    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the university of southern california play a round lower than 5\" is true or false, let's analyze the relevant data in the table:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - The claim mentions \"the university of southern california,\" so we need to find entries where the school is \"university of southern california.\"\n\n2. **Locate the Entry for the University of Southern California:**\n   - From the table data, locate any entry with \"university of southern california\" in the \"school\" column.\n\n3. **Check the Round Number for This Entry:**\n   - Once located, check the corresponding \"round\" number for this school.\n\n4. **Analyze the Round Information:**\n   - The claim states that they played a round lower than 5. Therefore, we need to verify if the identified entry has a round number less than 5.\n\n### Examination of Table Data\n\n- **Row Analysis:**\n  - Row 1: School is \"miami - dade college\" (not relevant).\n  - Row 2: School is \"university of michigan\" (not relevant).\n  - Row 3: School is \"trinity university\" (not relevant).\n  - Row 4: School is \"gulf coast community college\" (not relevant).\n  - **Row 5:** School is \"university of southern california.\"\n    - The round number for this entry is 5.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The entry for the University of Southern California is in round 5.\n- Since 5 is not lower than 5, the claim that they played a round lower than 5 is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cell from the table is:\n- Row index: 4 (0-based indexing)\n- Column name: \"round\" and \"school\"\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the entry for 'university of southern california' in the table. Found it in row 5 with a round number of 5. Since 5 is not lower than 5, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
