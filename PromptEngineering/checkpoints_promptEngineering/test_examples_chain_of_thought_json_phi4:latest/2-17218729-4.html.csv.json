    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down each part of it:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Pittsburgh had a game against Montreal with more than 24 points after December 19.\n   - It also mentions an attendance figure of 14995.\n\n2. **Analyzing Each Part:**\n\n   a. **Game Between Pittsburgh and Montreal:**\n      - We need to identify if there is any record in the table where Pittsburgh plays as \"home\" against Montreal.\n      - From the data, on December 25th, the entry shows:\n        ```json\n        {\n          \"date\": \"december 25\",\n          \"visitor\": \"montreal\",\n          \"score\": \"2 - 4\",\n          \"home\": \"pittsburgh\",\n          \"attendance\": 7778,\n          \"record\": \"11 - 19 - 5\",\n          \"points\": 27\n        }\n        ```\n      - This confirms a game between Pittsburgh and Montreal on December 25th.\n\n   b. **Points After December 19:**\n      - We need to verify if the points for Pittsburgh after December 19 are more than 24.\n      - On December 19, the points were 25.\n      - On December 22, the points remained 25.\n      - On December 25 (the game against Montreal), the points increased to 27.\n      - Thus, on December 25, Pittsburgh had more than 24 points.\n\n   c. **Attendance of 14995:**\n      - We need to check if any game has an attendance of 14995 after December 19.\n      - On December 25 (Montreal vs. Pittsburgh), the attendance was 7778.\n      - The attendance figure of 14995 appears on:\n        - December 5 (Pittsburgh vs. Boston)\n        - December 19 (Pittsburgh vs. Boston)\n      - There is no game with an attendance of 14995 after December 19.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Pittsburgh did play against Montreal after December 19 and had more than 24 points.\n   - However, the attendance for this game was not 14995.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires verifying three conditions: a game between Pittsburgh and Montreal after December 19, points greater than 24, and an attendance of 14995.
