The claim has \"leather,\" but the table may have a slight variation such as \"leathers.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Examination:\n\n1. **Locate Row with Pick 25**:\n   - Scan through the \"pick\" column for the number 25.\n   - We find that row 11 has the pick number 25.\n\n2. **Check Player Name in Row 11**:\n   - In row 11, under the \"player\" column, the name is \"jonathan leathers\".\n\n3. **Compare with Claim**:\n   - The claim mentions \"jonathan leather,\" but the table lists \"jonathan leathers\".\n   - Despite this minor variation (missing 's'), it's reasonable to assume they refer to the same individual.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that the name is a close match and considering common variations in spelling, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\n### Final Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim 'jonathan leather be pick 25th' was verified by locating row 11 in the table where the pick number is 25.
