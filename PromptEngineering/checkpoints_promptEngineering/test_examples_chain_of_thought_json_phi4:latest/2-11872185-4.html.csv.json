    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze the data provided in the table regarding the \"lifetime india distributor share\" column, specifically focusing on the year each movie was released.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that no lifetime India distributor share is given earlier than 2009. This implies that all movies listed with their respective shares must have been released in or after the year 2009.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Column**: We need to focus on two columns: \"year\" and \"lifetime india distributor share\".\n\n3. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - Row 1: Movie \"Chennai Express\" (2013) with a lifetime India distributor share.\n   - Row 2: Movie \"Ek Tha Tiger\" (2012) with a lifetime India distributor share.\n   - Row 3: Movie \"3 Idiots\" (2009) with a lifetime India distributor share.\n   - Row 4: Movie \"Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani\" (2013) with a lifetime India distributor share.\n   - Row 5: Movie \"Dabangg 2\" (2012) with a lifetime India distributor share.\n   - Row 6: Movie \"Bodyguard\" (2011) with a lifetime India distributor share.\n   - Row 7: Movie \"Dabangg\" (2010) with a lifetime India distributor share.\n   - Row 8: Movie \"Rowdy Rathore\" (2012) with a lifetime India distributor share.\n   - Row 9: Movie \"Agneepath\" (2012) with a lifetime India distributor share.\n   - Row 10: Movie \"Ready\" (2011) with a lifetime India distributor share.\n\n4. **Check for Movies Released Before 2009**:\n   - All movies listed have release years of either 2009 or later.\n   - The earliest year mentioned is 2009 (\"3 Idiots\").\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since all the movies were released in or after 2009, there are no lifetime India distributor shares given for a movie released before 2009.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that no lifetime India distributor share is given earlier than 2009.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"lifetime India share earlier than 2009 be 0\" is true or false, we need to examine the data for movies released before 2009 and check their lifetime India distributor shares.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Movies Released Before 2009:**\n   - We need to find all rows in the table where the \"year\" column value is less than 2009.\n\n2. **Check Lifetime India Distributor Share for These Movies:**\n   - For each movie identified in step 1, we will examine the \"lifetime india distributor share\" column to see if any have a non-zero value.\n\n3. **Analyze the Data:**\n   - The data provided does not include any movies with a release year earlier than 2009. All movies listed have years ranging from 2010 to 2013.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there are no movies in the table released before 2009, it is impossible for any of them to have a non-zero lifetime India distributor share.\n   - Therefore, the claim that \"lifetime India share earlier than 2009 be 0\" is true by default due to the absence of such data.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table does not contain any movies released before 2009.

Extract the release year for \"ek tha tiger\", which is 2012.\n\n3. Compare the extracted year (2012) with the year mentioned in the claim (2009).\n\n4. Since 2012 does not match 2009, the claim that \"ek tha tiger\" was first released in 2009 is false.\n\n5.
