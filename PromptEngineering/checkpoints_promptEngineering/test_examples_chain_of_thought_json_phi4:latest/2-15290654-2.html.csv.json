    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the tournament in Budva in 1998 having a clay surface and the score being 3 - 6, 6 - 2, 6 - 2 is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We are looking for the entry corresponding to the year 1998 and the tournament in Budva.\n   - The columns of interest are \"date,\" \"tournament,\" \"surface,\" and \"score.\"\n\n2. **Locate the Row:**\n   - According to the data provided, there is a row with:\n     - `date`: 1998\n     - `tournament`: Budva\n\n3. **Check Surface Type:**\n   - For the identified row (Budva in 1998), check the \"surface\" column.\n   - The surface listed is \"clay.\"\n\n4. **Verify Score:**\n   - Check the \"score\" for this entry.\n   - The score given is \"3 - 6, 6 - 3, 6 - 2.\"\n\n5. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the score should be \"3 - 6, 6 - 2, 6 - 2.\"\n   - Compare this with the actual score \"3 - 6, 6 - 3, 6 - 2.\"\n\n6. **Determine Truthfulness of Claim:**\n   - The surface matches (\"clay\").\n   - The scores do not match (claimed score is different from the recorded score).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim is false because while the surface type is correctly identified as clay, the score does not match what is listed in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The relevant row for the Budva tournament in 1998 shows a 'clay' surface and a score of '3 - 6, 6 - 3, 6 - 2'.
