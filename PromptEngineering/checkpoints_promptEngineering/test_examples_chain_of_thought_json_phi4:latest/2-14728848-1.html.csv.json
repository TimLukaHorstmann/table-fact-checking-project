    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Chris Jackson is true, we need to verify two key pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. Chris Jackson's team name.\n2. Whether his car model is a Mazda RX-7 with a 20B engine.\n\nLet's go through the data step-by-step:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Chris Jackson's Entry**:\n   - We look for an entry where the \"driver\" column contains \"chris jackson\".\n   - From the table, we find the following entry:\n     ```\n     [\n       \"csj engineering steves toy shop\",\n       \"opel\",\n       \"calibra\",\n       \"chevrolet 6.0 v8\",\n       \"chris jackson\"\n     ]\n     ```\n   - This entry is at row index 19.\n\n2. **Verify the Car Model and Engine**:\n   - For Chris Jackson, the \"car model\" listed is \"calibra\".\n   - The \"engine\" specified for this car is \"chevrolet 6.0 v8\".\n\n3. **Compare with Claim Requirements**:\n   - The claim specifies that Chris Jackson's team drives a Mazda RX-7 with a 20B engine.\n   - However, from the data, we see that Chris Jackson drives an Opel Calibra with a Chevrolet 6.0 V8 engine.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The car model and engine type do not match those specified in the claim (Mazda RX-7 with a 20B engine).\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification are:\n\n- Row index 19, column \"team\": \"csj engineering steves toy shop\"\n- Row index 19, column \"car model\": \"calibra\"\n- Row index 19, column \"engine\": \"chevrolet 6.0 v8\"\n- Row index 19, column \"driver\": \"chris jackson\"\n\n### Final JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, we identified Chris Jackson's entry in the table which is at row index 19. We then checked his car model and engine type; they are 'calibra' and 'chevrolet 6.0 v8', respectively. These do not match the Mazda RX-7 with a 20B engine as claimed.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"car model\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"engine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"driver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
