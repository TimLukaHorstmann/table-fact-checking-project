    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to verify if Roy was indeed one of the two highest scorers on December 17th and December 19th. Let's examine each date individually.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - For December 17th:\n     - Row index 8\n   - For December 19th:\n     - Row index 10\n\n2. **Check Leading Scorers for Each Date:**\n\n   - **December 17th:**\n     - From row index 8, the \"leading scorer\" is listed as \"roy : 24\".\n     - This means Roy scored 24 points and was the leading scorer.\n\n   - **December 19th:**\n     - From row index 10, the \"leading scorer\" is listed as \"roy : 25\".\n     - This indicates that Roy scored 25 points and was again the leading scorer.\n\n3. **Determine if Roy was One of the Two Highest Scorers:**\n\n   - For both dates, since Roy is listed as the leading scorer, he must be one of the two highest scorers (in fact, the highest scorer) on those days.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that \"Roy be the second highest scorer with 24 and 25 respectively.\" However, based on the data:\n     - On December 17th, Roy was the leading scorer with 24 points.\n     - On December 19th, Roy was also the leading scorer with 25 points.\n   - Therefore, Roy was not the second highest scorer; he was the highest.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"For both December 17th and December 19th, Roy is listed as the leading scorer, indicating that he scored more than any other player on those dates.
