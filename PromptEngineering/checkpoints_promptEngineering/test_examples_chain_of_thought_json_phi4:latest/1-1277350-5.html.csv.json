    "resp": "To determine whether the statement \"the word Friday in the Polish language is 'pi\u0105tek'\" is true, we need to analyze the data provided.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Language**: We are interested in the translation of \"Friday\" into the Polish language.\n   \n2. **Locate Polish Data**: \n   - The data is organized with each row corresponding to a different language and columns representing translations for days of the week starting from Sunday to Saturday.\n   - The Polish language is mentioned in the first row under the column \"Polish\".\n\n3. **Find Column for Friday**:\n   - In this structured table, days of the week are translated from left to right, starting with Sunday at index 1 and ending with Saturday at index 7.\n\n4. **Extract Translation for Friday**:\n   - According to the data structure, the column corresponding to Friday is indexed as 6.\n   - We locate the entry for Polish in this column (row index 0) which should give us the translation of \"Friday\".\n\n5. **Check the Value**:\n   - The value at row index 0 and column index 6 is 'pi\u0105tek'.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on these steps, the word \"Friday\" in Polish is indeed \"pi\u0105tek\".
