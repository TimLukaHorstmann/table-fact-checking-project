We need to locate this year in the table.\n   \n2. **Verify the Champion and Runner-up:**\n   - For the year 2010, find the row with `year` equal to 2010.\n   - Check the `champion` column for Jiyai Shin.\n   - Verify that Inbee Park is listed as a runner-up in the `runner(s) - up` column.\n\n3. **Verify the Venue:**\n   - Confirm the event took place at \"royal birkdale golf club\" as specified in the claim.\n\n4. **Check the Margin of Victory:**\n   - The claim states a 9-stroke margin of victory.
