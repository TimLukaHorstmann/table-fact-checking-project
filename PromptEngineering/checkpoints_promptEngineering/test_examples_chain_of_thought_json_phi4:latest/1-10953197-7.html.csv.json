Metoyer is the director. We need to verify if he directed the episode with a matching or similar title.\n\n3. **Verify the Production Code**: The production code provided in the claim is 2398204. This needs to match the production code of the identified episode.\n\nNow, let's examine the data:\n\n- **Row Identification**:\n  - We look for an entry where the \"title\" column matches or closely resembles \"a fist full of secret.\"\n  - The title \"fist full of secrets\" appears in row 213. Note the slight difference: \"secrets\" instead of \"secret.\"\n\n- **Director Verification**:\n  - In row 213, the \"director\" is listed as Robert J. Metoyer, which matches the claim.\n\n- **Production Code Check**:\n  - The production code for row 213 is 2398204, which also matches the claim.\n\nBased on these steps, we can conclude:\n\n- The title in the data is \"a fist full of secrets,\" which is a minor variation from \"a fist full of secret\" mentioned in the claim.\n- Both the director and production code match exactly with those specified in the claim.\n\nThus, despite the slight difference in wording for the title, all other details align correctly.
