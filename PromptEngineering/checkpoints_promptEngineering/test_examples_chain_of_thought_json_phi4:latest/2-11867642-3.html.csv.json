On May 3rd, the score should be \"7 - 3\" and the opponent should be \"tigers.\"\n\nLet's examine these step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Row with Date \"May 3\"\n- We will scan through the data to find the row where the date is \"may 3.\"\n- From the table, we identify that the row corresponding to \"may 3\" is at index 2.\n\n### Step 2: Check the Opponent and Score for May 3\n- For this row (index 2), check the \"opponent\" column. The opponent listed is \"rockies,\" not \"tigers.\"\n- Next, check the \"score\" column. The score listed is \"3 - 0,\" not \"7 - 3.\"\n\n### Step 3: Check for Any Other Occurrences of Score \"7 - 3\" Against the Tigers\n- We need to verify if there are any entries where the opponent is \"tigers\" and the score is \"7 - 3.\"\n- Scan through all rows:\n  - For index 18, date is \"may 20,\" opponent is \"tigers,\" and score is \"7 - 6.\" (Not a match)\n  - No other entry has both \"opponent\" as \"tigers\" and \"score\" as \"7 - 3.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n- There are no entries where the date is May 3rd with the opponent being \"tigers\" and score \"7 - 3.\"\n- Additionally, there is no date with a score of \"7 - 3\" against the Tigers.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE. \n\nHere is the final JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The row for 'may 3' has an opponent 'rockies' and score '3 - 0'. There are no entries with a score of '7 - 3' against the Tigers.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

This corresponds to a specific entry in the data list.\n\n2. **Check the Record on May 11th:**\n   - Locate the row with \"date\": \"may 11\".\n   - Check the value of the \"record\" column for this row.\n   - The record listed for \"may 11\" is \"23 - 12\".\n\n3. **Verify the Score on May 11th:**\n   - In the same row (\"date\": \"may 11\"), check the value in the \"score\" column.\n   - The score listed for \"may 11\" is \"5 - 4\".\n\n4. **Check for Other Instances of Record \"18 - 8\" and Score \"3 - 2\":**\n   - Scan through all rows to see if any other row has a record of \"18 - 8\".\n   - Specifically, find the row with the score \"3 - 2\" and check its record.\n   - The only instance of a score \"3 - 2\" is on \"may 2\", where the record is \"19 - 8\".\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - On May 11th, the record is not \"18 - 8\"; it's \"23 - 12\".\n   - There is no date with both a record of \"18 - 8\" and a score of \"3 - 2\".\n   - Therefore, the claim that May 11th has the record \"18 - 8\" and score \"3 - 2\" is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that on May 11th, the record should be '18 - 8' and the score '3 - 2'.
