North Melbourne lost this game.\n\n3. **Locate Footscray's Game:**\n   - Look for rows where \"home team\" or \"away team\" is \"footscray\".\n   - In row 5, Footscray is the \"away team\" with a score of 11.12 (78) against Hawthorn.\n   - Check if Footscray won: The score was 10.9 (69) for Hawthorn and 11.12 (78) for Footscray. Footscray won this game.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that both North Melbourne and Footscray win by a score less than 70 points.\n   - North Melbourne did not win, so the condition is already false.\n   - For completeness, check if Footscray's winning margin was less than 70 points:\n     - Footscray scored 11.12 (78) and Hawthorn scored 10.9 (69).\n     - The difference in scores is 78 - 69 = 9 points, which is indeed less than 70.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since North Melbourne did not win, the claim \"north melbourne and footscray both win by score less than 70 point\" is false.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified relevant games for North Melbourne and Footscray.
