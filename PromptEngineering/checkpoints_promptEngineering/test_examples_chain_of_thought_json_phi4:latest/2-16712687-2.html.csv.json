    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"76059 attend when the result be l 20 - 17\" is true or false, we need to verify if there exists a record in the data with an attendance of 76,059 and a game result of L 20 - 17.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:**\n   - We are interested in two columns: \"result\" for the game outcome and \"attendance\" for the number of attendees.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Each Row:**\n   - We will check each row in the data to see if both conditions (attendance = 76059 and result = L 20 - 17) are met simultaneously.\n\n3. **Examine Each Entry:**\n   - Look at each entry's \"result\" and \"attendance\" values:\n     - Week 1: Result is \"L 27 - 0\", Attendance is 57406\n     - Week 2: Result is \"W 23 - 17\", Attendance is 62063\n     - Week 3: Result is \"L 20 - 7\", Attendance is 69814\n     - Week 4: Result is \"L 21 - 14\", Attendance is 44433\n     - Week 5: Result is \"L 20 - 6\", Attendance is 64578\n     - **Week 6**: Result is \"L 31 - 14\", Attendance is 52728\n     - **Week 7**: Result is \"L 20 - 17\", Attendance is 76059 (This matches both conditions)\n     - Week 8: Result is \"W 17 - 7\", Attendance is 46336\n     - Week 9: Result is \"L 41 - 10\", Attendance is 63637\n     - Week 10: Result is \"W 21 - 13\", Attendance is 61068\n     - Week 11: Result is \"L 20 - 10\", Attendance is 45215\n     - Week 12: Result is \"W 27 - 24\", Attendance is 49581\n     - Week 13: Result is \"L 31 - 14\", Attendance is 62209\n     - Week 14: Result is \"L 30 - 3\", Attendance is 46923\n     - Week 15: Result is \"L 35 - 7\", Attendance is 45518\n     - Week 16: Result is \"L 21 - 17\", Attendance is 43639\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The condition of having an attendance of 76,059 and a result of L 20 - 17 is met in Week 7.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - For Week 7:\n     - \"result\" column has the value \"L 20 - 17\".\n     - \"attendance\" column has the value 76059.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim '76059 attend when the result be l 20 - 17' is verified by checking each row in the data for an attendance of 76059 and a game result of L 20 - 17. This condition is met in Week 7, where both the attendance and result match.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
