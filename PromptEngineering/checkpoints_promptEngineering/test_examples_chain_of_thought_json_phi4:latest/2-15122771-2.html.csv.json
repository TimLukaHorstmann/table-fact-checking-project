We will compare our count to this number.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n- **Week 1**: Result is \"t 35 - 35\" (tie), not a win.\n- **Week 2**: Result is \"w 17 - 16\", which is a win.\n- **Week 3**: Result is \"w 24 - 14\", which is a win.\n- **Week 4**: Result is \"w 20 - 14\", which is a win.\n- **Week 5**: Result is \"t 17 - 17\" (tie), not a win.\n- **Week 6**: Result is \"w 27 - 21\", which is a win.\n- **Week 7**: Result is \"l 49 - 34\", not a win.\n- **Week 8**: Result is \"l 38 - 10\", not a win.\n- **Week 9**: Result is \"w 17 - 9\", which is a win.\n- **Week 10**: Result is \"l 23 - 21\", not a win.\n- **Week 11**: Result is \"l 42 - 24\", not a win.\n- **Week 12**: Result is \"l 37 - 14\", not a win.\n- **Week 13**: Result is \"l 34 - 21\", not a win.\n- **Week 14**: Result is \"l 27 - 24\", not a win.\n\n**Count of Wins**: The Redskins won in weeks 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9.
