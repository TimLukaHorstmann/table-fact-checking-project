    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we will analyze each part of the claim and compare it to the data provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Show \"Centennial\":**\n   - We need to locate the entry for the show titled \"centennial\" in the data.\n   - From the table, row 19 contains:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"no in season\": 19,\n       \"no in series\": 100,\n       \"title\": \"centennial\",\n       \"directed by\": \"christine moore\",\n       \"written by\": \"karen maser\",\n       \"original air date\": \"august 5 , 2012\",\n       \"us viewers (million)\": 2.82\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Check the Original Air Date for \"Centennial\":**\n   - The original air date listed for \"centennial\" is \"august 5, 2012\".\n   - The claim states that the original air date should be \"august 26, 2019\", which does not match.\n\n3. **Check the No in Season for August 26, 2019:**\n   - We need to find an entry with the original air date of \"august 26, 2012\".\n   - From the table, row 22 contains:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"no in season\": 22,\n       \"no in series\": 103,\n       \"title\": \"domestic maneuvers\",\n       \"directed by\": \"chris peppe\",\n       \"written by\": \"bill rinier\",\n       \"original air date\": \"august 26 , 2012\",\n       \"us viewers (million)\": 3.37\n     }\n     ```\n   - The show with the original air date of \"august 26, 2012\" is \"domestic maneuvers\", not \"centennial\".\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that the show \"centennial\" has an original air date of \"august 26, 2019\" and a no in season of 22.\n   - Based on the table:\n     - \"Centennial\" aired on \"august 5, 2012\", not \"august 26, 2019\".\n     - The show with an original air date of \"august 26, 2012\" has a no in season of 22, but it is \"domestic maneuvers\", not \"centennial\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Locate the entry for 'centennial' which shows an air date of 'august 5, 2012'. 2. Identify that the original air date 'august 26, 2019' does not match any show in the table. 3. Find the entry with the original air date 'august 26, 2012', which is for 'domestic maneuvers', not 'centennial'. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"title\", \"value\": \"centennial\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"original air date\", \"value\": \"august 5 , 2012\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"original air date\", \"value\": \"august 26 , 2012\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"title\", \"value\": \"domestic maneuvers\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
