    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"before March 6, Montreal be the visitor\" is true or false, we need to verify if there's any record of a game before March 6 where Montreal was listed as the visitor against Philadelphia.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure**: \n   - The table contains columns: \"date\", \"visitor\", \"score\", \"home\", \"decision\", \"attendance\", and \"record\".\n   - We are interested in the \"date\" and \"visitor\" columns to verify if Montreal was listed as a visitor before March 6.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Time Frame**:\n   - We need to check records with dates earlier than March 6.\n\n3. **Examine Each Record Before March 6**:\n   - Look at each row in the data where the \"date\" is less than March 6.\n   - Check if the \"visitor\" column lists \"Montreal\".\n\n4. **Check Each Entry**:\n   - **March 1**: Visitor is \"philadelphia\". Not Montreal.\n   - **March 2**: Visitor is \"ny rangers\". Not Montreal.\n   - **March 4**: Visitor is \"philadelphia\". Not Montreal.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - There are no records before March 6 where Montreal was the visitor against Philadelphia.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Checked each record with a date before March 6 and found that none of them listed Montreal as the visitor.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
