Compare our counted matches to this number.\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n- **Row 1**: Date is \"July 21, 1946\" \u2014 does not match.\n- **Row 2**: Date is \"May 2, 1948\" \u2014 matches (Race: \"2nd grand prix de gen\u00e8ve\").\n- **Row 3**: Date is \"May 2, 1948\" \u2014 matches (Race: \"2nd grand prix des nations\").\n- **Row 4**: Date is \"July 30, 1950\" \u2014 does not match.\n- **Row 5**: Date is \"July 30, 1950\" \u2014 does not match.\n\n**Count of Matches**: There are exactly 2 entries with the date \"May 2, 1948\".\n\nSince the count matches the claim's assertion that there were 2 races on May 2, 1948, we conclude that the statement is TRUE.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim '2 races took place on May 2, 1948', I reviewed each row to find entries with this date.
