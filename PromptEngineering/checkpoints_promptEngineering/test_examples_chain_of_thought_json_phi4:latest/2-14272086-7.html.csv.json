    "resp": "To determine if the claim about the Texas Rangers' most poorly attended game when they played against the Angels is true or false, we need to analyze the attendance figures for games involving the Angels.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Games Against the Angels:**\n   - Look through the data and identify all entries where the opponent was \"angels.\"\n   - From the table, these games occurred on:\n     - July 7\n     - July 8\n     - July 9\n     - July 10\n\n2. **Extract Attendance Figures for These Games:**\n   - For July 7 against the Angels, attendance was 21,170.\n   - For July 8 against the Angels, attendance was 18,788.\n   - For July 9 against the Angels, attendance was 24,515.\n   - For July 10 against the Angels, attendance was 23,262.\n\n3. **Determine the Lowest Attendance:**\n   - Compare the attendance figures for these games:\n     - 21,170 (July 7)\n     - 18,788 (July 8) \u2190 This is the lowest.\n     - 24,515 (July 9)\n     - 23,262 (July 10)\n\n4. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the most poorly attended game against the Angels was when they played against them. \n   - From our analysis, July 8 had the lowest attendance figure of 18,788.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is true because the game on July 8 indeed had the lowest attendance among games against the Angels.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified all games against the 'angels' and extracted their attendance figures.
