    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Boston Bruins' record on March 12 being \"27 - 11 - 9\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - The claim pertains to a game involving the Boston Bruins on March 12.\n   - Locate entries in the table where the opponent is \"boston bruins\" and the month (march) is 12.\n\n2. **Locate Game Entries for Boston Bruins**:\n   - From the data provided, identify rows where the \"opponent\" column matches \"boston bruins\":\n     - Row 47: Opponent = \"boston bruins\", Date = March 12\n     - Row 48: Opponent = \"boston bruins\", Date = March 14\n\n3. **Check Records on and Before March 12**:\n   - The record before the game on March 12 must be examined to verify if it was indeed \"27 - 11 - 9\" at that time.\n   - Row 46 (before March 12) shows a game against \"new york americans\" with a resulting record of \"27 - 10 - 9\".\n   - In Row 47, the game against \"boston bruins\" on March 12 resulted in a score of \"2 - 1\", and the record changed to \"27 - 11 - 9\".\n\n4. **Confirm Record Change**:\n   - The change from \"27 - 10 - 9\" to \"27 - 11 - 9\" indicates that before this game, Boston Bruins had a loss count of 10.\n   - After winning the March 12 game against them, their record became \"27 - 11 - 9\".\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states that on March 12, the Boston Bruins' record was \"27 - 11 - 9\". This is true because after the game on March 12 (Row 47), this was indeed their record.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows two games against the Boston Bruins.
