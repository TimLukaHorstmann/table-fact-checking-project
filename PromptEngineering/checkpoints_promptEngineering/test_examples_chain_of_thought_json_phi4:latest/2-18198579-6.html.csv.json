We will locate this year in the data provided in the JSON format.\n\n2. **Locate the Earnings Data:**\n   - For each row in the data, check the \"year\" column to find the entry for 2011.\n   - Once we identify the correct row for 2011, we need to look at the \"earnings\" column to determine the actual earnings value.\n\n3. **Extract and Compare Earnings:**\n   - In the table, the row corresponding to the year 2011 has an \"earnings\" value of \"365231\".\n   - The claim states that the earnings are \"only 5100\", which is significantly lower than the actual recorded amount.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the actual earnings for 2011 are \"365231\", and not \"5100\", the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row corresponding to the year 2011:\n  - \"year\": 2011\n  - \"earnings\": 365231\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim pertains to the earnings in 2011.
