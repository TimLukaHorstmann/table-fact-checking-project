We need to find the row corresponding to the year 2000 and examine the \"tournaments played\" column for that entry.\n\n2. **Locate the Year 2000 Data**:\n   - The table is structured with each row representing a different year.\n   - Locate the row where the \"year\" is 2000.\n\n3. **Extract Information from the Table**:\n   - For the year 2000, find the value in the \"tournaments played\" column.\n   - According to the data: \n     ```json\n     [\n       2000,\n       29,\n       14,\n       0,\n       \"t - 17\",\n       143248,\n       \"179\"\n     ]\n     ```\n   - The number of tournaments played in 2000 is listed as 29.\n\n4. **Compare with the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the number of tournament plays in 2000 was 2.\n   - From our extraction, we see it is actually 29.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the actual number (29) does not match the claimed number (2), the statement is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's format this reasoning into a JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim pertains to the number of tournaments played in 2000.\",\n    \"Locate the row for year 2000 in the table.\",\n    \"In the 'tournaments played' column, find the value corresponding to the year 2000.\",\n    \"The table shows that 29 tournaments were played in 2000.\",\n    \"Compare this with the claim stating there were 2 tournaments played.\",\n    \"Since 29 does not equal 2, the claim is FALSE.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"tournaments played\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
