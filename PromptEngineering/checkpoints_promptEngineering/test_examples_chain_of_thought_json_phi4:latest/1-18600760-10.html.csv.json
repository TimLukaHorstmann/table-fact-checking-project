By examining the table's data entries under the \"township\" column, we find that Johnstown is listed as one of the townships.\n\n2. **Verify the Geo ID for Johnstown**:\n   - Once we identify the correct row for Johnstown, we need to check the value in the \"geo id\" column for this specific row.\n   \n3. **Compare with Claimed Value**:\n   - Compare the geo ID found in step 2 with the claimed geo ID of \"3810340820\".\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n1. **Locate Johnstown's Row**:\n   - Scanning through each entry under the \"township\" column, we find that there is a row where the township is listed as \"johnstown\".\n   - The entry for Johnstown in terms of index and content is: \n     ```json\n     [\n       \"johnstown\",\n       \"grand forks\",\n       79,\n       36.199,\n       0.0,\n       48.151362,\n       \"- 97.449033\",\n       3803540940,\n       1036624\n     ]\n     ```\n   - This entry is at row index 8.\n\n2. **Extract Geo ID for Johnstown**:\n   - From the identified row, we extract the geo ID: \"3803540940\".\n\n3. **Compare with Claimed Geo ID**:\n   - The claim states that the geo ID should be \"3810340820\".\n   - Comparing both values, \"3803540940\" (actual) vs. \"3810340820\" (claimed), they are not equal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on our comparison, the actual geo ID for Johnstown is different from the claimed value.
