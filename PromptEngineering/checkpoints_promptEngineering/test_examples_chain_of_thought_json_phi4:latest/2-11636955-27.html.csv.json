The relevant information can be found in the \"pl gp\" column for each player.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Column of Interest:**\n   - We are interested in the \"pl gp\" (playoff games) column to determine how many playoff games each player has played.\n\n2. **Examine Each Player's Playoff Games Played (\"pl gp\"):**\n   - For `Peter Schaefer` at row index 2, \"pl gp\" is 3.\n   - For `Larry Courville` at row index 1, \"pl gp\" is 0.\n   - For `Chris McAllister` at row index 0, \"pl gp\" is 0.\n   - For `Lloyd Shaw` at row index 3, \"pl gp\" is 0.\n   - For `Todd Norman` at row index 4, \"pl gp\" is 0.\n   - For `Brent Sopel` at row index 5, \"pl gp\" is 42.\n   - For `Stu Bodtker` at row index 6, \"pl gp\" is 0.\n   - For `Tyler Willis` at row index 7, \"pl gp\" is 0.\n   - For `Jason Cugnet` at row index 8, \"pl gp\" is 0.\n\n3. **Identify Players with Positive Playoff Games Played:**\n   - Only `Peter Schaefer` and `Brent Sopel` have non-zero values in the \"pl gp\" column (3 and 42 respectively).\n\n4. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Peter Schaefer and Brent Sopel are the only two players on the chart who played in playoff games. Based on our examination, this is accurate since no other player has a non-zero value in the \"pl gp\" column.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is true because only `Peter Schaefer` and `Brent Sopel` have played in playoff games according to the data provided in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We examined the 'pl gp' (playoff games) column for each player.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Brent Sopel played fewer regular season games than Peter Schaefer\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data from the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Players:**\n   - The claim involves two players: Brent Sopel and Peter Schaefer.\n\n2. **Locate Data for Each Player:**\n   - Find the row in the table that contains information about Brent Sopel.\n   - Find the row in the table that contains information about Peter Schaefer.\n\n3. **Extract \"Reg GP\" (Regular Season Games Played) Values:**\n   - For each player, look at the \"reg gp\" column to find out how many regular season games they played.\n\n4. **Compare the Values:**\n   - Compare the number of regular season games played by Brent Sopel with those played by Peter Schaefer.\n\n5. **Determine the Truth of the Claim:**\n   - If Brent Sopel's \"reg gp\" is less than Peter Schaefer's, then the claim is true.\n   - Otherwise, the claim is false.\n\n### Detailed Examination:\n\n- **Brent Sopel:**\n  - Locate the row for Brent Sopel:\n    - Row Index: 5\n    - \"Reg GP\": 322\n\n- **Peter Schaefer:**\n  - Locate the row for Peter Schaefer:\n    - Row Index: 2\n    - \"Reg GP\": 178\n\n### Comparison:\n\n- Brent Sopel played 322 regular season games.\n- Peter Schaefer played 178 regular season games.\n\nSince 322 (Brent Sopel) is greater than 178 (Peter Schaefer), Brent Sopel did not play fewer regular season games than Peter Schaefer. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the rows for Brent Sopel and Peter Schaefer.
