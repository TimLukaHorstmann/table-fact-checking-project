    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"no episode be broadcast in September\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data related to the broadcast dates of each episode.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - The column that contains information about when episodes were broadcast is the \"broadcast date\" column.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row for Broadcast Dates in September:**\n   - We will check each row's entry under the \"broadcast date\" column to see if any of them fall within the month of September 2005.\n\n3. **Check Each Episode's Broadcast Date:**\n\n   - **ep 2**: July 15, 2005\n     - Not in September.\n   \n   - **ep 3**: July 22, 2005\n     - Not in September.\n   \n   - **ep 4**: July 29, 2005\n     - Not in September.\n   \n   - **ep 5**: August 5, 2005\n     - Not in September.\n   \n   - **ep 6**: August 12, 2005\n     - Not in September.\n   \n   - **ep 7**: August 19, 2005\n     - Not in September.\n\n   - **ep 9**: September 2, 2005\n     - This date is in September. Thus, an episode was broadcast in September.\n   \n   - **ep 10**: September 9, 2005\n     - This date is also in September. Another episode was broadcast in September.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there are episodes (specifically ep 9 and ep 10) with broadcast dates in September, the claim \"no episode be broadcast in September\" is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For **ep 9**: \n  - Row index: 6\n  - Column name: \"broadcast date\"\n  - Cell value: \"September 2, 2005\"\n\n- For **ep 10**:\n  - Row index: 7\n  - Column name: \"broadcast date\"\n  - Cell value: \"September 9, 2005\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The 'broadcast date' column was checked for each episode. Episodes ep 9 and ep 10 have broadcast dates in September 2005, disproving the claim that no episodes were broadcast in September.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
