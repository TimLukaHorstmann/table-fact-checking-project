There are three names with this total:\n  - Daikirin\n  - Tochiazuma II\n  - Kisenosato\n\n### Step 3: Check the Last Record Month\n\n#### For Highest Total (Kotonishiki)\n- We find Kotonishiki's row and check the \"last\" column.\n- The last record for Kotonishiki is in September 1999.\n\n#### For Lowest Totals\n- We need to check each of the three names with 22 victories:\n  - **Daikirin**: Last record is in September 1970.\n  - **Tochiazuma II**: Last record is in January 2005 (not September).\n  - **Kisenosato**: Last record is in September 2011.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- For Kotonishiki, the last record month is September, which satisfies the condition for the highest total.\n- Among the names with the lowest total victories:\n  - Daikirin and Kisenosato have their last records in September.\n  - Tochiazuma II does not have a last record in September.\n\nSince the claim requires both the highest and lowest totals to have their last records in September, and Tochiazuma II fails this condition, the overall claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n- Kotonishiki's \"last\" column: Row 0, Column \"last\"\n- Daikirin's \"last\" column: Row 10, Column \"last\"\n- Tochiazuma II's \"last\" column: Row 11, Column \"last\"\n- Kisenosato's \"last\" column: Row 12, Column \"last\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the highest total (Kotonishiki with 34) and checked its last record month (September 1999).
