    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the only defensive tackle be corey peter, with a pick number of 19\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the provided table data focusing on:\n\n1. The position \"defensive tackle.\"\n2. The name \"corey peters.\"\n3. The pick number being 19.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify rows with position \"defensive tackle\":**\n   - Check each row in the `data` array to find entries where the `position` is \"defensive tackle.\"\n\n2. **Examine relevant rows for details:**\n   - Row 2:\n     - `round`: 3\n     - `pick`: 19\n     - `overall`: 83\n     - `name`: \"corey peters\"\n     - `position`: \"defensive tackle\"\n     - `college`: \"kentucky\"\n\n3. **Verify the claim details:**\n   - According to row 2, there is a player named \"corey peters\" who plays as a \"defensive tackle.\"\n   - The pick number for this player is indeed 19.\n\n4. **Check if any other defensive tackles exist in the table:**\n   - Review all rows again specifically looking for any additional entries with `position` as \"defensive tackle.\"\n\n5. **Conclusion on exclusivity:**\n   - There are no other entries in the data where the `position` is \"defensive tackle\" besides row 2.\n\nBased on these steps, the claim that \"the only defensive tackle be corey peter, with a pick number of 19\" is TRUE because:\n\n- Corey Peters is indeed listed as the sole player with the position \"defensive tackle.\"\n- His pick number matches the specified 19.\n  \n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify rows with 'defensive tackle' as the position. Confirm that 'corey peters' is the only such entry, and his pick number is 19. Verify no other entries exist for 'defensive tackle'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
