    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the largest attendance was on September 16, 1973\" is true or false, we need to analyze the 'attendance' column of the provided table for each game played.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Attendance Column:**\n   - Locate the column labeled \"attendance\" in the table which contains numerical values representing the number of spectators at each game.\n\n2. **Extract Attendance Values:**\n   - List all attendance figures from each week:\n     - Week 1 (September 16, 1973): 44,818\n     - Week 2 (September 23, 1973): 52,035\n     - Week 3 (September 30, 1973): 48,176\n     - Week 4 (October 7, 1973): 49,549\n     - Week 5 (October 14, 1973): 56,438\n     - Week 6 (October 21, 1973): 47,478\n     - Week 7 (October 28, 1973): 47,787\n     - Week 8 (November 4, 1973): 46,722\n     - Week 9 (November 11, 1973): 47,911\n     - Week 10 (November 19, 1973): 56,519\n     - Week 11 (November 25, 1973): 46,430\n     - Week 12 (December 2, 1973): 57,859\n     - Week 13 (December 8, 1973): 53,830\n     - Week 14 (December 16, 1973): 70,041\n\n3. **Identify the Maximum Attendance:**\n   - Compare all attendance figures to find the maximum value.\n   - The largest attendance figure is 70,041 for Week 14 on December 16, 1973.\n\n4. **Compare Claim with Data:**\n   - The claim states that the largest attendance was on September 16, 1973, which had an attendance of 44,818.\n   - Since 44,818 is not the maximum value (70,041 from Week 14), the claim is false.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is incorrect because the largest attendance occurred on December 16, 1973, not September 16, 1973.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - Relevant cells for this analysis are those containing attendance figures and specifically:\n     - Attendance for Week 1 (September 16, 1973): 44,818\n     - Attendance for Week 14 (December 16, 1973): 70,041\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the 'attendance' column and extracted all attendance figures.
