    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"David Frost be from United States\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data for any entry corresponding to David Frost's country.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - We are looking for an entry with the player name \"David Frost.\"\n\n2. **Examine the Data:**\n   - The data contains multiple rows, each representing a different player and their details.\n   - Locate David Frost's row in the table:\n     ```json\n     [\n       \"t2\",\n       \"david frost\",\n       \"south africa\",\n       \"70 + 68 + 70 = 208\",\n       \"- 5\"\n     ]\n     ```\n   - This is found as the third entry (index 2, since indexing starts from 0).\n\n3. **Check Country Information:**\n   - In David Frost's row, the column labeled \"country\" states \"south africa.\"\n\n4. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - The claim asserts that David Frost is from the United States.\n   - However, according to the table, he is listed as being from South Africa.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the country in the table does not match the United States, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row Index 2:\n  - Column \"player\": \"david frost\"\n  - Column \"country\": \"south africa\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The data shows that David Frost's country is 'south africa', not the United States. Therefore, the claim that he is from the United States is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
