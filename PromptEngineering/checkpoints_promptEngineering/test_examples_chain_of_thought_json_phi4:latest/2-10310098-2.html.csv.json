    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we'll need to verify several conditions from the data provided:\n\n1. **Verify Opponent Names:**\n   - We must find entries where the opponent's name is \"shamil abdurahimov\" and \"houston alexander.\"\n\n2. **Check Results for Wins:**\n   - For both opponents, check if the result was a \"win.\"\n\n3. **Confirm Method of Win:**\n   - Ensure that the method of winning for both fights was \"tko (punches).\"\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions step-by-step using the data from the JSON table.\n\n### Step 1: Locate Entries for Each Opponent\n\n- For \"shamil abdurahimov\":\n  - **Row 9:** The opponent is \"shamil abdurahimov.\" \n    - Result: \"loss\"\n    - Method: \"tko (punches)\"\n  \n- For \"houston alexander\":\n  - **Row 11:** The opponent is \"houston alexander.\"\n    - Result: \"loss\"\n    - Method: \"tko (punches)\"\n\n### Step 2: Verify Results\n\n- From the data:\n  - Against \"shamil abdurahimov,\" the result was a \"loss,\" not a win.\n  - Against \"houston alexander,\" the result was also a \"loss.\"\n\n### Step 3: Confirm Method of Win\n\n- Both entries indicate that the method was \"tko (punches),\" but since both results were losses, this condition does not meet the claim's requirements.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that both fights with \"shamil abdurahimov\" and \"houston alexander\" resulted in wins by \"tko (punches).\" However, both entries show a loss instead of a win.
