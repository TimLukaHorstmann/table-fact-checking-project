    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Dennis Wilson's album \"Pacific Ocean Blue\" being the earliest re-release from Caribou Records before 2008 is true or false, let\u2019s break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: \n   - We need to find all entries in the table related to Dennis Wilson and his album \"Pacific Ocean Blue.\"\n\n2. **Extract Information about Releases**:\n   - The claim specifically mentions re-releases before 2008, so we focus on those entries with release years less than 2008.\n\n3. **Examine Each Entry for \"Pacific Ocean Blue\"**:\n   - Check the rows where the artist is Dennis Wilson and the album is \"Pacific Ocean Blue.\"\n\n4. **Determine Re-release Years**:\n   - Look at the \"year\" column for these entries to identify release years.\n   - We need to find out which of these are re-releases, i.e., years after 1977 (the original year mentioned in the data).\n\n5. **Find the Earliest Re-release Before 2008**:\n   - Compare the re-release years to determine the earliest one before 2008.\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that \"Pacific Ocean Blue\" is the earliest re-release from Caribou Records before 2008.\n   - Verify if there are any other albums by different artists in the table released earlier than the identified earliest re-release of \"Pacific Ocean Blue.\"\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - If no other album has an earlier re-release year, the claim is true.\n   - If another album has an earlier re-release year, the claim is false.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n- **Identify Entries for Dennis Wilson's \"Pacific Ocean Blue\"**:\n  - Row 13: Year 1977 (original release).\n  - Row 14: Year 1991 (re-release).\n  - Row 15: Year 2008 (re-release).\n\n- **Determine Re-releases Before 2008**:\n  - From the entries, 1991 is a re-release before 2008.\n\n- **Check for Earlier Re-releases from Other Albums**:\n  - Review other artists' albums to see if any have a re-release year earlier than 1991.\n  - \"La (Light Album)\" has a CD release in 1989.\n  - \"Keepin' the Summer Alive\" has a CD release in 1991.\n  - None of these are earlier than 1991.\n\n- **Conclusion**:\n  - The earliest re-release before 2008 for \"Pacific Ocean Blue\" is indeed 1991.\n  - No other album has an earlier re-release year than 1991 from Caribou Records.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify entries related to Dennis Wilson's 'Pacific Ocean Blue'.\",\n    \"Extract release years for these entries.\",\n    \"Focus on re-releases before 2008, identifying 1991 as the earliest.\",\n    \"Check other albums for earlier re-release years.\",\n    \"Conclude that no album has an earlier re-release than 1991.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
