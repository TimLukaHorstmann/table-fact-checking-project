    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Hatem Aqel competing in a friendly competition in February 2004 is true or false, we need to examine the table for entries matching specific criteria: date (February 2004), result (friendly competition).\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Date**: The claim specifies \"february 2004\". We need to filter data where the \"date\" column matches this time frame.\n\n2. **Locate Entries for February 2004**:\n   - From the table, we identify entries with a date in February 2004.\n   - There is one entry on \"18 february 2004\".\n\n3. **Check Competition Type**:\n   - For the entry dated \"18 february 2004\", check the \"competition\" column to see if it is labeled as \"friendly\".\n   - The competition type for this date is listed as \"2006 fifa world cup qualification\".\n\n4. **Evaluate Claim Against Data**:\n   - The claim states that Hatem Aqel competed in a friendly competition in February 2004.\n   - The only entry from February 2004 does not match the \"friendly\" label; instead, it is part of the \"2006 fifa world cup qualification\".\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the competition on \"18 february 2004\" was not a friendly but rather for the \"2006 fifa world cup qualification\", the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cell from the table that directly addresses the claim is at row index 2 (third entry) with the columns:\n  - \"date\": \"18 february 2004\"\n  - \"competition\": \"2006 fifa world cup qualification\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the final conclusion is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Hatem Aqel competed in a friendly competition in February 2004.
