We need to verify if our count matches this number.\n\n### Execution\n\n- **May 1**: Attendance is 33439\n- **May 2**: Attendance is 22896\n- **May 3**: Attendance is 20809\n- **May 4**: Attendance is 22628\n- **May 5**: Attendance is 22588\n- **May 7**: Attendance is 44622\n- **May 8**: Attendance is 43211\n- **May 9**: Attendance is 47236\n- **May 10**: Attendance is 50198\n- **May 11**: Attendance is 50206\n- **May 12**: Attendance is 50108\n- **May 13**: Attendance is 44275\n- **May 14**: Attendance is 43357\n- **May 15**: Attendance is 50113\n- **May 17**: Attendance is 30095\n- **May 18**: Attendance is 34861\n- **May 19**: Attendance is 41015\n- **May 20**: Attendance is 24631\n- **May 21**: Attendance is 22738\n- **May 22**: Attendance is 34028\n- **May 24**: Attendance is 26408\n- **May 25**: Attendance is 36732\n- **May 26**: Attendance is 45307\n- **May 28**: Attendance is 50299\n- **May 29**: Attendance is 50262\n- **May 30**: Attendance is 50271\n- **May 31**: Attendance is 50252\n\n### Analysis\n\n- None of the attendance figures for games played in May are below 5000. \n- Therefore, there are 0 games with attendance lower than 5000.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim that there were 8 games with an attendance lower than 5000 in May 1991 is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We examined the 'attendance' column for each game played in May.
