This will give us all matches that took place in round 3.\n\n2. **Filter for Defeats:**\n   - From the round 3 matches, we need to filter out those where the result (\"res\") was a \"loss\". These are the defeats.\n\n3. **Check Opponent's Name:**\n   - For each defeat identified in step 2, check if the opponent's name is \"Hayate Usui\" by examining the \"opponent\" column.\n\n4. **Count Defeats Against Hayate Usui in Round 3:**\n   - Count how many times a loss occurred against \"Hayate Usui\" specifically in round 3.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Round 3 Entries:**\n  - The table contains only one entry with \"round\": 3.\n    - Row Index 1:\n      - `res`: \"loss\"\n      - `record`: \"10 - 7 - 1\"\n      - `opponent`: \"hiroshi nakamura\"\n      - `method`: \"decision (unanimous)\"\n      - `event`: \"shooto\"\n      - `round`: 3\n      - `time`: \"5:00\"\n\n- **Defeat Check:**\n  - The single round 3 match is a loss, but the opponent is \"hiroshi nakamura\", not \"Hayate Usui\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- There are no defeats against \"Hayate Usui\" in round 3.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We checked all entries with 'round' equal to 3 and found only one such entry.
