    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, let's analyze each component of the claim step-by-step using the data from the table.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"Lugo, Emilia - Romagna be the venue when the competition be friendly on 26 May 1999 and the result be 2 - 4.\"\n\nWe need to verify three components:\n1. The date is 26 May 1999.\n2. The venue is Lugo, Emilia-Romagna.\n3. The competition is a friendly match.\n4. The result of the match is 2 - 4.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Date Verification**:\n   - Locate an entry with \"date\" equal to \"26 May 1999\".\n   - From the table, we find:\n     ```json\n     [\n       17,\n       \"26 may 1999\",\n       \"lugo , emilia - romagna\",\n       \"1 - 4\",\n       \"friendly\"\n     ]\n     ```\n   - This entry matches the date specified in the claim.\n\n2. **Venue Verification**:\n   - For the same row (row index 17), check the \"venue\" column.\n   - The venue is listed as \"lugo, emilia - romagna\", which matches the venue mentioned in the claim.\n\n3. **Competition Type Verification**:\n   - Check the \"competition\" column for this row.\n   - It states \"friendly\", confirming that the competition type matches the claim.\n\n4. **Result Verification**:\n   - Finally, verify the \"result\" column.\n   - The result is listed as \"1 - 4\".\n   - The claim mentions a result of \"2 - 4\", which does not match.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe first three components (date, venue, and competition type) are correct. However, the result stated in the claim (\"2 - 4\") does not match the actual result from the table (\"1 - 4\"). Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row index: 17\n  - \"date\": \"26 may 1999\"\n  - \"venue\": \"lugo , emilia - romagna\"\n  - \"competition\": \"friendly\"\n  - \"result\": \"1 - 4\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim specifies a match on 26 May 1999 at Lugo, Emilia-Romagna as a friendly with a result of 2 - 4.
