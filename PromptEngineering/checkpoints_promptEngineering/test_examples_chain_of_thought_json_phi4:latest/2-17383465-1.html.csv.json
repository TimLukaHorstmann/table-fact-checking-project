    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"James Campbell be 2 pick ahead of Rodney McCray in round 1\" is TRUE or FALSE, let's break down the information given in the table:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Round 1 Picks**:\n   - The claim pertains to players selected in Round 1.\n   - In the data, look for entries where \"round\" equals 1.\n\n2. **Locate Rodney McCray's Pick**:\n   - Find the entry for \"Rodney McCray\".\n   - According to the table:  \n     ```json\n     [\n       1,\n       3,\n       \"rodney mccray\",\n       \"united states\",\n       \"louisville\"\n     ]\n     ```\n   - Rodney McCray is pick number 3 in Round 1.\n\n3. **Check for James Campbell's Pick**:\n   - Find the entry for \"James Campbell\".\n   - According to the table:  \n     ```json\n     [\n       9,\n       185,\n       \"james campbell\",\n       \"united states\",\n       \"oklahoma city\"\n     ]\n     ```\n   - James Campbell is pick number 185 in Round 9.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that James Campbell should be \"2 picks ahead of Rodney McCray\" in Round 1.\n   - For James Campbell to be 2 picks ahead, his pick would need to be 1 (since Rodney is pick number 3).\n   - However, James Campbell was picked in Round 9 as the 185th overall pick, not in Round 1.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since James Campbell was not selected in Round 1, he cannot be \"2 picks ahead of Rodney McCray\" in that round.\n   - The claim is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim involves comparing pick positions in Round 1.\",\n    \"Rodney McCray was the 3rd overall pick in Round 1.\",\n    \"James Campbell was selected as the 185th overall pick in Round 9, not in Round 1.\",\n    \"Therefore, James Campbell cannot be '2 picks ahead' of Rodney McCray in Round 1.\",\n    \"The claim is FALSE.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
