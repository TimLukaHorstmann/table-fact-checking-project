    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"home team carlton play away team st kilda at princess park\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the row corresponding to the match involving Carlton:**\n   - We look for a row where the \"home team\" column contains \"carlton\".\n\n2. **Check the details of this row:**\n   - Once we find the row with Carlton as the home team, we need to verify:\n     - The \"away team\" is listed as \"st kilda\".\n     - The \"venue\" is specified as \"princes park\".\n\n3. **Verification from the table data:**\n   - According to the table data:\n     - In the second row (index 1):\n       - \"home team\": \"carlton\"\n       - \"away team\": \"st kilda\"\n       - \"venue\": \"princes park\"\n\n4. **Compare with the claim:**\n   - The claim states \"princess park\", which should be compared to the venue in the data.\n   - The venue in the data is \"princes park\", not \"princess park\".\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the venue name does not match exactly due to a difference between \"princes park\" and \"princess park\", the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The row with Carlton as the home team matches all conditions except for the venue name.
