Specifically look for entries where multiple positions are indicated with a \"/\".\n\nLet's go through the data step-by-step:\n\n- **Row 1 (Pick 43, Stephane Morin):** Position is \"center\". Only one position listed.\n- **Row 2 (Pick 44, Jason Zent):** Position is \"left wing\". Only one position listed.\n- **Row 3 (Pick 45, Rob Zamuner):** Position is \"left wing\".

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"100% of the players drafted from pick 43 to 63 in 1989 are male\" is true or false, we need to examine the data provided for each player listed between picks 43 and 63. Here's how we can approach this:\n\n### Reasoning Steps\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Data:**\n   - We have a list of players with their respective draft pick numbers from 43 to 63.\n\n2. **Examine Each Entry:**\n   - For each player, check if there is any indication that they are not male.\n   - The table does not explicitly mention gender, so we must infer based on common knowledge unless an exception is known or stated elsewhere (e.g., a well-known case of a female player in this draft).\n\n3. **List the Players and Their Information:**\n   - Review each row for picks 43 to 63:\n     - Pick 43: Stephane Morin, Center, Canada\n     - Pick 44: Jason Zent, Left Wing, United States\n     - Pick 45: Rob Zamuner, Left Wing, Canada\n     - Pick 46: Jason Cirone, Centre, Canada\n     - Pick 47: Scott Pellerin, Left Wing, Canada\n     - Pick 48: Bob Kellogg, Defence, United States\n     - Pick 49: Louie Debrusk, Left Wing, Canada\n     - Pick 50: Veli-Pekka Kautonen, Defence, Finland\n     - Pick 51: Pierre Sevigny, Left Wing, Canada\n     - Pick 52: Blair Atcheynum, Right Wing, Canada\n     - Pick 53: Nicklas Lidstrom, Defence, Sweden\n     - Pick 54: John Tanner, Goaltender, Canada\n     - Pick 55: Denny Felsner, Left Wing, United States\n     - Pick 56: Scott Thomas, Right Wing, United States\n     - Pick 57: Wes Walz, Centre, Canada\n     - Pick 58: John Brill, Left/Right Wing, United States\n     - Pick 59: Jim Mathieson, Defence, Canada\n     - Pick 60: Murray Garbutt, Centre, Canada\n     - Pick 61: Jason Woolley, Defence, Canada\n     - Pick 62: Kris Draper, Defence, Canada\n     - Pick 63: Corey Lyons, Right Wing, Canada\n\n4. **Check for Known Exceptions:**\n   - Historically, the NHL Drafts from the late 1980s did not include female players.\n   - Hilary Knight, a notable female ice hockey player, was drafted in 2008, well after this period.\n\n5. **Conclusion Based on Data and Historical Context:**\n   - All listed players are male based on historical records of the NHL Draft in 1989.\n   - There is no indication or record of any female player being drafted between picks 43 and 63 in that year.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists players from pick 43 to 63, all with traditionally male names associated with them.
