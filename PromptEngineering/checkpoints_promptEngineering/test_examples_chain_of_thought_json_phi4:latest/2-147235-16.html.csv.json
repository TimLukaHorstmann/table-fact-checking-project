    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to evaluate the metric values for each character in the table and identify which ones are measured in grams (g). Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that only the characters \"\u9322\" and \"\u65a4\" have their metric values expressed in grams.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - We need to look at the \"metric value\" column for each row.\n   - Convert or interpret these values to see if they are expressed in grams (g).\n\n3. **Evaluate Each Row**:\n\n   - **Row 1**: \n     - Character: \"\\u5398\"\n     - Metric Value: \"37.79931 mg\"\n     - Measurement: milligrams (mg), not grams.\n\n   - **Row 2**: \n     - Character: \"\\u5206\"\n     - Metric Value: \"377.9936375 mg\"\n     - Measurement: milligrams (mg), not grams.\n\n   - **Row 3**:\n     - Character: \"\\u9322\" (\u65a4)\n     - Metric Value: \"3.779936375 g\"\n     - Measurement: grams (g).\n\n   - **Row 4**: \n     - Character: \"\\u5169\"\n     - Metric Value: \"37.79936375 g\"\n     - Measurement: grams (g).\n\n   - **Row 5**:\n     - Character: \"\\u65a4\" (\u9322)\n     - Metric Value: \"604.78982 g\"\n     - Measurement: grams (g).\n\n   - **Row 6**: \n     - Character: \"\\u62c5 / \\u64d4\"\n     - Metric Value: \"60.478982 kg\"\n     - Measurement: kilograms (kg), not grams.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The characters with metric values in grams are:\n     - Row 3: \u65a4 (\"3.779936375 g\")\n     - Row 4: \"\\u5169\" (\"37.79936375 g\")\n     - Row 5: \u9322 (\"604.78982 g\")\n   - Therefore, the claim is false because there is an additional character (\"\\u5169\") with a metric value in grams.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - Row 3, Column \"metric value\"\n   - Row 4, Column \"metric value\"\n   - Row 5, Column \"metric value\"\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that only \u9322 and \u65a4 have metric values measured in grams.
