This does not match \"green bay packers\".\n\n   - **Date: December 11, 1988**\n     - Look for a row where the date matches \"december 11 , 1988\".\n     - Check if the opponent is listed as \"green bay packers\".\n     - From the table:\n       - Row 15 has the date \"december 11 , 1988\" and the opponent \"green bay packers\". This matches.\n\n4. **Count Occurrences of \"Green Bay Packers\":**\n   - Now, check all rows to see how many times \"green bay packers\" appears as an opponent.\n     - Row 7: Date is \"october 16 , 1988\", Opponent is \"green bay packers\".\n     - Row 15: Date is \"december 11 , 1988\", Opponent is \"green bay packers\".\n\n5. **Conclusion Based on Analysis:**\n   - \"Green bay packers\" appears twice as an opponent, but only once on December 11, 1988.\n   - There is no record of \"green bay packers\" being the opponent on September 4, 1988.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim that \"green bay packer be the opponent 2 time , on september 4 , 1988 and on december 11 , 1988\" is FALSE.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states 'green bay packers' as opponents on September 4, 1988, and December 11, 1988.
