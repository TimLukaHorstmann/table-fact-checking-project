    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:** The claim states that the closest match of the day was between Richmond and Collingwood, with a score difference of only 4 points. Specifically, it mentions:\n   - Richmond scored 11.14 (80) and lost to\n   - Collingwood who scored 13.4 (82).\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Data:** We need to extract the scores for each match from the table and calculate the point differences.\n\n3. **Calculate Point Differences:**\n   - For each game, we will find the absolute difference between the home team score and the away team score.\n   \n4. **Identify the Closest Match:**\n   - Compare all calculated point differences to identify which game had the smallest difference.\n\n5. **Verify the Claimed Game:**\n   - Check if the Richmond vs Collingwood match is indeed the one with the smallest difference and verify the scores mentioned in the claim.\n\n6. **Determine the Accuracy of the Claim:** \n   - If the Richmond vs Collingwood game had the smallest point difference and the scores match, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1. **Extract Scores and Calculate Differences:**\n\n   - **Game 1: Geelong vs North Melbourne**\n     - Geelong: 26.16 (172)\n     - North Melbourne: 15.7 (97)\n     - Difference: |172 - 97| = 75 points\n   \n   - **Game 2: Fitzroy vs Melbourne**\n     - Fitzroy: 13.10 (88)\n     - Melbourne: 15.17 (107)\n     - Difference: |88 - 107| = 19 points\n\n   - **Game 3: South Melbourne vs St Kilda**\n     - South Melbourne: 13.16 (94)\n     - St Kilda: 9.15 (69)\n     - Difference: |94 - 69| = 25 points\n   \n   - **Game 4: Hawthorn vs Footscray**\n     - Hawthorn: 12.13 (85)\n     - Footscray: 14.6 (90)\n     - Difference: |85 - 90| = 5 points\n\n   - **Game 5: Richmond vs Collingwood**\n     - Richmond: 11.14 (80)\n     - Collingwood: 13.4 (82)\n     - Difference: |80 - 82| = 2 points\n\n   - **Game 6: Essendon vs Carlton**\n     - Essendon: 11.12 (78)\n     - Carlton: 22.8 (140)\n     - Difference: |78 - 140| = 62 points\n\n2. **Identify the Closest Match:**\n\n   - The smallest difference is 2 points in the Richmond vs Collingwood match.\n\n3. **Verify the Claimed Game:**\n   \n   - The claim states that Richmond scored 11.14 (80) and lost to Collingwood who scored 13.4 (82), which matches exactly with the data extracted.\n   - The point difference is indeed 2 points, not 4 as mentioned in the claim.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe closest match of the day was between Richmond and Collingwood with a score difference of 2 points, not 4 points as claimed.
