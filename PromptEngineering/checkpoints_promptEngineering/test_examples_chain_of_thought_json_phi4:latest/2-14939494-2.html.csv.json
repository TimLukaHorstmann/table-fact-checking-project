    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about hurricanes Frank and Estelle during the 2010 Pacific hurricane season is true or false, we need to analyze their respective death tolls based on the data provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data for Each Hurricane:**\n   - Look up the row in the table corresponding to \"frank\" and note the deaths column.\n   - Similarly, look up the row corresponding to \"estelle\" and note the deaths column.\n\n2. **Extract Death Information:**\n   - For Frank:\n     - Locate \"frank\" in the data array (row index 8).\n     - The death toll is given as \"6\".\n   - For Estelle:\n     - Locate \"estelle\" in the data array (row index 7).\n     - The death toll is recorded as \"0\".\n\n3. **Compare Death Tolls:**\n   - Frank has a reported death toll of 6.\n   - Estelle has a reported death toll of 0.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Hurricane Frank had fewer deaths than Hurricane Estelle.\n   - From our data comparison, Frank (6 deaths) actually had more deaths than Estelle (0 deaths).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The statement is false because Frank did not have fewer deaths; instead, he had more.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n- For Frank:\n  - Row index: 8\n  - Column name: \"deaths\"\n  \n- For Estelle:\n  - Row index: 7\n  - Column name: \"deaths\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false. Here's how it looks in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify data for Frank and Estelle; extract death tolls from their respective rows (6 for Frank, 0 for Estelle); compare the numbers to see that Frank had more deaths than Estelle; thus, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"deaths\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"deaths\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
