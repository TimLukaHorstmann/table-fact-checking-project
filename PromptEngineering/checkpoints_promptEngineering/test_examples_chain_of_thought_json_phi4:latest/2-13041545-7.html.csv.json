    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"36438 be the highest attendance of a game that have a score of 3 - 5\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Games with Score 3 - 5**: We'll first locate all entries in the data where the \"score\" column matches \"3 - 5\".\n\n2. **Extract Attendance for These Games**: For each game identified in step 1, note down the corresponding attendance figure.\n\n3. **Compare Attendances**: Find out which of these games had the highest attendance and compare it to the number mentioned in the claim (36438).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Determine if the highest attendance among games with a score of \"3 - 5\" is indeed 36438.\n\nNow, let's execute these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Games with Score 3 - 5\n\n- **Row 5** (\"august 5\"): Opponent is \"st louis cardinals\", Score is \"3 - 4\".\n- **Row 17** (\"august 17\"): Opponent is \"houston astros\", Score is \"3 - 7\".\n- **Row 25** (\"august 25\"): Opponent is \"florida marlins\", Score is \"5 - 6\".\n- **Row 31** (\"august 31\"): Opponent is \"houston astros\", Score is \"3 - 5\".\n\nOnly **Row 31** has the score \"3 - 5\".\n\n### Step 2: Extract Attendance for These Games\n\nFrom Row 31:\n- Attendance is 36438.\n\n### Step 3: Compare Attendances\n\nSince there is only one game with a score of \"3 - 5\", its attendance of 36438 is trivially the highest.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim that 36438 be the highest attendance of a game that has a score of \"3 - 5\" is TRUE because it's the only such game in the data set, and thus its attendance is automatically the highest by default.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified games with score '3 - 5', found Row 31 as the only match.
