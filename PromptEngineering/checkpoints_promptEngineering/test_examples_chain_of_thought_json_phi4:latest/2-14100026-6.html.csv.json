Row 0: Points Difference = \"35 - 09\"\n     2. Row 1: Points Difference = \"69 - 07\"\n     3. Row 2: Points Difference = \"19 - 16\"\n     4. Row 3: Points Difference = \"29 - 27\"\n     5. Row 4: Points Difference = \"03 - 96\"\n\n4. **Analyze the Second Set of Games (Row 1):**\n   - According to the table, in the second set of games (row index 1), the points difference is \"69 - 07.\"\n   - This indicates that in one of these games, the team scored 69 goals while conceding 7 goals.\n\n5. **Verify Scoring Context:**\n   - The claim mentions scoring a total of 69 points, but it seems to be referring to a single game score (goals) since \"points difference\" is typically used for goal differences in hockey.\n   - In the context of ice hockey, \"points\" generally refer to standings or ranking points, not goals.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The table shows that in the second set of games, the team scored 69 goals in one game, which matches the claim about scoring the highest score total of 69.\n   - Therefore, the claim is TRUE based on the data provided.\n\nNow, let's format this conclusion into the required JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows a 'points difference' column with values like '69 - 07', indicating goals scored and conceded in games.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the highest total point in the 1989 world ice hockey championship be 5 point\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table data.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Column of Interest:**\n   - The column that represents the total points is labeled as \"points.\"\n\n2. **Examine Each Row for Points:**\n   - Look at each row in the \"data\" section to find the values under the \"points\" column.\n\n3. **Compare Point Values:**\n   - Row 1: Points = 6\n   - Row 2: Points = 5\n   - Row 3: Points = 3\n   - Row 4: Points = 2\n   - Row 5: Points = 0\n\n4. **Determine the Maximum Value:**\n   - The highest value in the \"points\" column is 6.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the highest total point is 5.\n   - However, we found a higher value of 6 points in the table.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is a value greater than 5 (specifically 6), the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The 'points' column was examined for each row to find the maximum value.
