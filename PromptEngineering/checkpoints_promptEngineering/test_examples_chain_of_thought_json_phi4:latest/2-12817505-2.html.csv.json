    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Manchester United have always lost 3 out of 3 times to Portsmouth since 10 September 2005\" is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Matches:**\n   - We are interested in matches between Manchester United and Portsmouth after the date \"10 September 2005\".\n\n2. **Locate Matches with Portsmouth:**\n   - Look through the data for matches where the opponent is \"portsmouth\" and the date is on or after \"10 September 2005\".\n\n3. **Check Match Results:**\n   - For each identified match, check the result column (\"result f-a\") to see if Manchester United lost (indicated by a score where Portsmouth's goals are greater than Manchester United's).\n\n4. **Count Matches and Outcomes:**\n   - Count how many matches were played against Portsmouth since \"10 September 2005\".\n   - Verify if all these matches resulted in losses for Manchester United.\n\n### Analysis of the Data\n\n- **Match on 3 December 2005**:\n  - Opponent: Portsmouth\n  - Result: \"3 - 0\" (Manchester United lost)\n\n- **Match on 11 February 2006**:\n  - Opponent: Portsmouth\n  - Result: \"3 - 1\" (Manchester United lost)\n\nNo other matches against Portsmouth are listed after \"10 September 2005\".\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- Manchester United played 2 matches against Portsmouth since \"10 September 2005\".\n- Both matches resulted in losses for Manchester United.\n\nThe claim states \"always lose 3 out of 3 times,\" but only 2 matches were played, and both were lost. Therefore, the statement is technically true based on the available data (since they lost all their matches against Portsmouth), but it is misleading because it implies there was a third match which did not occur.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified matches with Portsmouth after 10 September 2005.
