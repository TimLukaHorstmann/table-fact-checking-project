    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about week 14 being on September 26, 1971, with an attendance of 57,895 is true or false, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Claim Components:**\n   - The claim specifies two conditions for week 14:\n     1. It should be on September 26, 1971.\n     2. The attendance should be 57,895.\n\n2. **Locate Week 14 in the Table:**\n   - Find the row corresponding to \"week\" number 14.\n   - From the table data, week 14 is:\n     ```json\n     [\n       14,\n       \"december 19 , 1971\",\n       \"new orleans saints\",\n       \"l 24 - 3\",\n       44582\n     ]\n     ```\n\n3. **Verify the Date for Week 14:**\n   - The date listed for week 14 is December 19, 1971.\n   - Compare this with the claimed date of September 26, 1971.\n\n4. **Verify the Attendance for Week 14:**\n   - The attendance listed for week 14 is 44,582.\n   - Compare this with the claimed attendance of 57,895.\n\n5. **Conclusion Based on Verification:**\n   - Since both the date and attendance do not match the claim:\n     - The actual date (December 19, 1971) does not match September 26, 1971.\n     - The actual attendance (44,582) does not match 57,895.\n\n6. **Determine Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - For Week 14: \n     - Date cell is at row index 13 (\"date\" column).\n     - Attendance cell is at row index 13 (\"attendance\" column).\n\n7. **Check if Any Other Week Matches the Claimed Date and Attendance:**\n   - Find the row where the date is September 26, 1971.\n   - From the table data:\n     ```json\n     [\n       2,\n       \"september 26 , 1971\",\n       \"los angeles rams\",\n       \"t 20 - 20\",\n       57895\n     ]\n     ```\n   - The attendance for this date is indeed 57,895.\n   - However, this corresponds to week 2, not week 14.\n\n8. **Final Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the checks above, the claim about week 14 being on September 26, 1971, with an attendance of 57,895 is FALSE.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim specifies that week 14 should be on September 26, 1971, with an attendance of 57,895.
