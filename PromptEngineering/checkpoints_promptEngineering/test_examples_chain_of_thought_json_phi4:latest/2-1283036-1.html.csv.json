The closest date is \"27 March 2006\".\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is no row with a start date of \"March 29, 2006\", the claim cannot be true.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was searched for an entry where 'screening started' is 'March 29, 2006'.
