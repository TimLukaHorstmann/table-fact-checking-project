According to the table, this corresponds to row index 1 (second entry in the data list).\n\n2. **Verify the Date of the Game**:\n   - Confirm that the game against Charlotte occurred on April 3. The date column for row index 1 confirms it as \"april 3\".\n\n3. **Check the Score and Result**:\n   - Verify the score to ensure it matches \"w 97 - 92 (ot)\" which indicates a win in overtime.\n   - Row index 1 shows exactly this result: \"w 97 - 92 (ot)\", indicating that Miami Heat won against Charlotte.\n\n4. **Check the Record Before and After the Game**:\n   - The record before this game is shown as \"39 - 36\" on April 1, which is the previous row index 0.\n   - The updated record after winning the game against Charlotte should be \"40 - 36\", indicating one more win added to their record.
