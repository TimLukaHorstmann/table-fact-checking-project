    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Philadelphia Flyers' record being \"40 - 11 - 10\" as of February 23rd is true, we will analyze the relevant data from the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Game:**\n   - We need to find the game against the Philadelphia Flyers.\n   - According to the table, this occurs at row index 13 where the opponent is \"philadelphia flyers\".\n\n2. **Check Date of the Game:**\n   - The column labeled \"february\" indicates that this game took place on February 23rd.\n\n3. **Verify the Record After This Game:**\n   - In row index 13, under the \"record\" column, it lists \"40 - 11 - 10\".\n   - This is directly after their match against the Philadelphia Flyers and confirms the record post-game.\n\n4. **Cross-verification with Previous Entries:**\n   - Check previous games to ensure consistency:\n     - The game before this one was on February 22nd against Montreal Canadiens, where the record was \"39 - 11 - 10\".\n     - This aligns logically as a win would increase the wins count by 1.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that the Philadelphia Flyers' record was \"40 - 11 - 10\" as of February 23rd.\n   - Based on our analysis, this is consistent with the data provided in the table for the game against them on February 23rd.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the relevant game against Philadelphia Flyers at row index 13.
