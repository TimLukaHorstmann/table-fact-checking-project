    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"on September 10, 2013, the result be 3 - 2\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the table data for entries matching the specified date and verify if the corresponding result matches \"3 - 2\". Here's how we can evaluate this:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Date**: The claim mentions September 10, 2013. We need to find an entry in the \"date\" column that exactly matches this date.\n\n2. **Locate the Entry**:\n   - Look through each row of the \"data\" array and check the value in the \"date\" column.\n   - Find that the fourth entry (index 4) has the date \"10 september 2013\". This is a match with the specified date in the claim.\n\n3. **Verify Result**:\n   - For this matching entry, check the corresponding value in the \"result\" column.\n   - The \"result\" for this row is listed as \"3 - 2\".\n\n4. **Compare With Claim**: \n   - The claim states that on September 10, 2013, the result should be \"3 - 2\".\n   - Since we found a matching entry with the date \"10 september 2013\" and the result \"3 - 2\", the claim is supported by the data.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the information from the table, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the entry in the table where the date matches '10 september 2013'.
