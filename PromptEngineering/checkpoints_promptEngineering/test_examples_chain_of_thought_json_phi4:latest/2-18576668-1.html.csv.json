Additionally, we are interested in the columns \"location\", \"date\", and possibly \"rank\" if needed to determine order.\n\n### Step 3: Filter Data for Season 2004-05\nFrom the table data:\n\n1. **Row 16**: \n   - Season: \"2003 - 04\"\n   - Location: \"kuala lumpur\"\n\n2. **Row 17**:\n   - Season: \"2005\"\n   - Event type, location, date, rank: Not needed since it's not within the season we're interested in.\n\n3. **Rows 18-19**:\n   - Season: \"2005\"\n   - Row 18:\n     - Location: \"los angeles\"\n     - Date: \"17 - 20 may 2005\"\n     - Event type: \"invitational\"\n   - Row 19:\n     - Location: \"london\"\n     - Date: \"8 - 10 july 2005\"\n     - Event type: \"pro tour\"\n\n4. **Row 20**:\n   - Season: \"2005\"\n   - Location: \"los angeles\"\n   - Date: \"28 - 30 october 2005\"\n   - Event type: \"pro tour\"\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Order of Events\nFrom Rows 18 to 20, which belong to season 2004-05 (or simply 2005), we have:\n\n1. **May 17-20, Los Angeles** (\"invitational\")\n2. **July 8-10, London** (\"pro tour\")\n3. **October 28-30, Los Angeles** (\"pro tour\")\n\n### Step 5: Check the Claim\nThe claim specifies that the last two events were in \"los angeles and london\".

Thus, we will examine each row of data where the \"season\" column indicates 2011.\n\n2. **Filter by Year**:\n   - Go through each row and check if the value in the \"season\" column is \"2011\".\n   \n3. **Count Events for 2011**:\n   - For each event that matches the year 2011, count how many such events exist.\n   \n4. **Verify Against Claim**:\n   - Compare the counted number of events with the claim (10 events).\n\n5. **Extract Relevant Information**:\n   - Identify and list relevant rows where \"season\" is 2011.\n\n### Applying Steps to the Data\n\n- We examine each row's \"season\":\n  - Row 19: Season = \"2005\", not 2011.\n  - ...\n  - Row 20: Season = \"2005\", not 2011.\n  - ...\n  - Row 21: Season = \"2011\".\n\n- After filtering, we find only one row where the season is \"2011\":\n  - Row 21 contains:\n    - Season: \"2011\"\n    - Event Type: \"pro tour\"\n    - Location: \"nagoya\"\n    - Format: \"block constructed and booster draft\"\n    - Date: \"10 - 12 june 2011\"\n    - Rank: 5\n\n- The total count of events in 2011 is **1**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states there are 10 events in 2011.
