The relevant decisions in Chuck Liddell's record are:\n1. Against Jeremy Horn at UFC 19 (Submission - Arm Triangle Choke).\n2. Against Vitor Belfort at UFC 37.5 (Decision - Unanimous).\n3. Against Jeff Monson at UFC 29 (Decision - Unanimous).\n4. Against Jos\u00e9 Landi-Jons at IVC 6 (Decision - Unanimous).\n\n### Step 3: Identify Opponents with Decisions\n\nThe opponents involved in decision matches against Chuck Liddell are:\n- Jeremy Horn\n- Vitor Belfort\n- Jeff Monson\n- Jos\u00e9 Landi-Jons\n\n### Step 4: Count Losses for Each Fighter\n\nNow, let's count the number of losses for each of these fighters based on their records:\n\n1. **Jeremy Horn**:\n   - Wins: 11\n   - Losses: 7 (The row indicating a loss against Liddell is included here.)\n\n2. **Vitor Belfort**:\n   - Wins: 25 (as of last known data)\n   - Losses: 14\n\n3. **Jeff Monson**:\n   - Wins: 28\n   - Losses: 10\n\n4. **Jos\u00e9 Landi-Jons**:\n   - Wins: 11\n   - Losses: 6\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate Noe Hernandez's Record\n\nNoe Hernandez, who fought Chuck Liddell at UFC 17, does not have a decision record in this fight (it was a decision win for Liddell). However, we should still check his overall loss count:\n- Wins: 14\n- Losses: 5\n\n### Step 6: Compare Loss Counts\n\nWe need to compare the number of losses for each fighter who had a decision match against Chuck Liddell:\n\n- Jeremy Horn: 7 losses\n- Vitor Belfort: 14 losses\n- Jeff Monson: 10 losses\n- Jos\u00e9 Landi-Jons: 6 losses\n\nNoe Hernandez has 5 losses, which is indeed fewer than any of the fighters listed above.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nNoe Hernandez does have the fewest losses among the fighters who had a decision against Chuck Liddell.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Noe Hernandez having the second highest number of wins amongst fighters who have a decision against Chuck Liddell is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Fighters with Decisions Against Chuck Liddell:**\n   - Go through each record in the data to find matches where the \"method\" column indicates a \"decision.\" \n   - These records are:\n     - Record 11: Randy Couture (ufc 43, loss)\n     - Record 19: Jeremy Horn (ufc 19, loss)\n\n2. **List Fighters and Their Total Wins Against Chuck Liddell:**\n   - For each fighter identified in step 1, count their total wins against Chuck Liddell.\n   - From the data:\n     - Randy Couture has one decision against Chuck Liddell (Record 11).\n     - Jeremy Horn also has one decision against Chuck Liddell (Record 19).\n\n3. **Count Wins for Each Fighter:**\n   - Check how many times each fighter has won against Chuck Liddell.\n   - From the data:\n     - Randy Couture never wins against Chuck Liddell; all his encounters result in losses or decisions against him.\n     - Jeremy Horn also never wins against Chuck Liddell; he loses by decision (Record 19) and later loses by submission (Record 15).\n\n4. **Determine Noe Hernandez's Wins Against Chuck Liddell:**\n   - Check if Noe Hernandez has any recorded fights against Chuck Liddell.\n   - From the data, Noe Hernandez fought once against Chuck Liddell in Record 20 and won by decision.\n\n5. **Rank Fighters Based on Wins Against Chuck Liddell:**\n   - Randy Couture: 0 wins\n   - Jeremy Horn: 0 wins\n   - Noe Hernandez: 1 win\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Noe Hernandez has the second highest number of wins amongst fighters who have a decision against Chuck Liddell.\n   - Since Randy Couture and Jeremy Horn both have zero wins, and Noe Hernandez has one win, he actually has the highest number of wins among them.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is false because Noe Hernandez has the highest (not second highest) number of wins against Chuck Liddell amongst fighters with a decision against him.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify fighters with decisions against Chuck Liddell: Randy Couture and Jeremy Horn.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to analyze the fight record involving Chuck Liddell from the provided table. The claim states that Noe Hernandez has the joint fewest losses among fighters who have a decision against Chuck Liddell.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Fights with Decisions:**\n   - First, we need to identify all fights involving Chuck Liddell that ended in a decision (either win or loss for Liddell).\n   \n2. **Extract Relevant Data:**\n   - From the table, extract rows where \"Chuck Liddell\" is listed as either the winner or loser and the method is \"decision\".\n\n3. **List Opponents with Decisions Against Chuck Liddell:**\n   - Identify opponents who lost to Chuck Liddell by decision.\n\n4. **Count Losses for Each Opponent:**\n   - For each opponent identified in step 3, count their total losses from the entire fight record provided.\n\n5. **Determine Fewest Losses:**\n   - Determine which of these opponents have the fewest number of losses.\n\n6. **Verify Noe Hernandez's Record:**\n   - Check if Noe Hernandez is among those with the fewest losses and confirm if he shares this position (i.e., \"joint fewest\").\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Fights with Decisions:**\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 9: Win against Vitor Belfort by decision.\n     - Row 10: Win against Amar Suloev by decision.\n     - Row 11: Win against Murilo Bustamante by decision.\n     - Row 12: Loss to Renato Sobral by TKO (not a decision).\n     - Row 13: Loss to Rich Franklin by KO/TKO (not a decision).\n     - Row 14: Win against Tito Ortiz by decision.\n\n2. **Extract Opponents with Decisions Against Chuck Liddell:**\n   - Opponents who lost to Liddell by decision:\n     - Vitor Belfort\n     - Amar Suloev\n     - Murilo Bustamante\n     - Tito Ortiz\n\n3. **Count Losses for Each Opponent:**\n   - Vitor Belfort: 14 losses (not all listed, but known from external data).\n   - Amar Suloev: 6 losses.\n   - Murilo Bustamante: 7 losses.\n   - Tito Ortiz: 13 losses.\n\n4. **Determine Fewest Losses:**\n   - Among the opponents who lost to Liddell by decision, Amar Suloev has the fewest losses (6).\n\n5. **Verify Noe Hernandez's Record:**\n   - Noe Hernandez is not listed as an opponent who lost to Chuck Liddell by decision.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nNoe Hernandez does not have a fight against Chuck Liddell that ended in a decision, so he cannot be considered among the fighters with decisions against Chuck Liddell.
