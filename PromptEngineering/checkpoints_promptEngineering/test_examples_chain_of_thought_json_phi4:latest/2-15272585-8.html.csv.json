The table does not explicitly list her as an opponent or winner/runner-up, so we must infer from the context.\n   - Her matches are represented by \"winner\" or \"runner-up\" outcomes.\n\n2. **Identify Matches on Different Surfaces:**\n   - We will categorize each match by surface type (clay or hard).\n\n3. **Count Wins and Losses:**\n   - For each surface, count the number of wins (\"winner\") and losses (\"runner-up\").\n\n4. **Calculate Winrate:**\n   - Winrate is calculated as the number of wins divided by the total number of matches on that surface.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - Check if her winrate on clay equals her winrate on hard courts.\n   - Verify if she has never won a match.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Clay Court Matches:**\n  - Match on \"3 october 2003\", \"latina\": Runner-up (Loss)\n  - Match on \"6 june 2006\", \"cuneo, italy\": Winner (Win)\n\n  Total Clay Matches = 2\n  Wins on Clay = 1\n  Losses on Clay = 1\n  Winrate on Clay = 1/2 = 0.5\n\n- **Hard Court Matches:**\n  - Match on \"28 january 2003\", \"tipton\": Runner-up (Loss)\n  - Match on \"29 june 2003\", \"mont-de-marsan\": Winner (Win)\n  - Match on \"8 november 2005\", \"pittsburgh\": Runner-up (Loss)\n\n  Total Hard Matches = 3\n  Wins on Hard = 1\n  Losses on Hard = 2\n  Winrate on Hard = 1/3 \u2248 0.33\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The winrate on clay (0.5) is not equal to the winrate on hard courts (\u22480.33).\n- Galina Voskoboeva has won at least one match, so she \"never win\" is false.\n\nThus, the claim that \"Galina Voskoboeva have an equal winrate between both clay and hard court but she never win\" is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, I identified matches involving Galina Voskoboeva by looking at 'winner' or 'runner-up' outcomes.
