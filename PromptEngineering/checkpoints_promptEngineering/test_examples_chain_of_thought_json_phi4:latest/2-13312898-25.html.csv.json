    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"round 9 involve the name glenn capriola\" is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that in round 9 of the draft, the player selected was named Glenn Capriola.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Columns**:\n   - We are interested in the columns \"round\", \"name\" since the claim involves checking a specific round and name.\n\n3. **Locate Round 9 Data**:\n   - Scan through the data to find entries where the value of the \"round\" column is 9.\n\n4. **Check the Name for Round 9**:\n   - Once we identify the entry for round 9, check the corresponding value in the \"name\" column to see if it matches \"Glenn Capriola\".\n\n5. **Compare and Conclude**:\n   - If the name matches, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the table:\n\n- **Step 3**: Locate Round 9 Data\n  - We find that the entry with `round` = 9 is: \n    ```\n    [9, 24, 247, \"glenn capriola\", \"running back\", \"boston college\"]\n    ```\n\n- **Step 4**: Check the Name for Round 9\n  - The name in this row is \"Glenn Capriola\".\n\n- **Step 5**: Compare and Conclude\n  - Since the name matches exactly, the claim is true.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify entries where 'round' equals 9.
