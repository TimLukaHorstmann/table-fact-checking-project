    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify whether Vince Carter had 43 high points and Alvin Williams had 9 high assists on March 10.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Locate the Data for March 10**:\n   - We look at the row corresponding to \"march 10\" in the data section of the table.\n   \n2. **Extract High Points Information**:\n   - Find the value under the \"high points\" column for March 10, which is \"vince carter (16)\".\n\n3. **Check the Value Against the Claim**:\n   - The claim states Vince Carter had 43 high points on March 10.\n   - From the data, we see that his actual high points were 16, not 43.\n\n4. **Extract High Assists Information**:\n   - Find the value under the \"high assists\" column for March 10, which is \"vince carter (4)\".\n\n5. **Check the Value Against the Claim**:\n   - The claim states Alvin Williams had 9 high assists on March 10.\n   - From the data, we see that it was Vince Carter who had 4 high assists, not Alvin Williams with 9.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Both parts of the claim are incorrect based on the table data for March 10.

This means the team did not win; they lost this game.\n\n5. **Verify the Score**:\n   - The score given in the claim is \"79 - 92\". According to the table, this matches the actual score for game 65 (\"79 - 92\").\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Although the score mentioned in the claim is correct, the statement that Orlando won the game is incorrect because they lost.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the claim \"orlando win game 65 with a score of 79 - 92\" is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"For game 65, the table shows that the team played against Orlando and lost with a score of 79 - 92.
