The lowest elevation peak should be 2848 meters located in Kenya.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Highest Elevation Peak**:\n   - From the data, each entry has an \"elevation (m)\" column which lists the height of each mountain.\n   - Locate the maximum value in this column to find the highest elevation peak.\n   - The table shows that Mount Kilimanjaro has an elevation of 5895 meters and is located in Tanzania. This matches the claim's description for the highest peak.\n\n2. **Identify the Lowest Elevation Peak**:\n   - Similarly, find the minimum value in the \"elevation (m)\" column to determine the lowest elevation.\n   - The table shows that Mount Kulal has an elevation of 2285 meters located in Kenya and is the lowest elevation peak listed.\n   - Another peak mentioned in the claim is Mount Ng'iro with an elevation of 2848 meters, also in Kenya. However, it is not the lowest; Mount Kulal is lower.\n\n3. **Conclusion on Each Assertion**:\n   - The first assertion (highest elevation) is correct: 5895 meters for Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania.\n   - The second assertion (lowest elevation) is incorrect: the actual lowest is 2285 meters for Mount Kulal, not 2848 meters.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim about the lowest elevation being 2848 meters in Kenya is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the highest elevation by finding the maximum value in the 'elevation (m)' column.\",\n    \"Mount Kilimanjaro has an elevation of 5895 meters and is located in Tanzania, matching the claim for the highest peak.\",\n    \"Identify the lowest elevation by finding the minimum value in the 'elevation (m)' column.\",\n    \"The lowest elevation listed is 2285 meters for Mount Kulal in Kenya, not 2848 meters as claimed.\",\n    \"Therefore, while the assertion about the highest peak is true, the one about the lowest peak is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"elevation (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"elevation (m)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
