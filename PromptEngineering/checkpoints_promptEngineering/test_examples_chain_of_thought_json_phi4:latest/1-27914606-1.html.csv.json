Let's analyze the relevant parts of the table step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Episodes Written by Jeff Astrof\n- We will look for episodes where \"Jeff Astrof\" is listed as a writer. According to the table, these are:\n  - Row 68: \"bahamian rhapsody (part 2)\" written by Kari Lizer & Jeff Astrof.\n  - Row 75: \"love means never having to say you 're crazy\" written by Jeff Astrof.\n  - Row 81: \"a family unfair\" written by Jeff Astrof.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Episodes Written by Matt Goldman\n- We will look for episodes where \"Matt Goldman\" is listed as a writer. According to the table, these are:\n  - Row 73: \"the curious case of britney b\" written by Matt Goldman.\n  - Row 87: \"scream\" written by Jeff Astrof & Matt Goldman.\n\n### Step 3: Check for Joint Writing\n- We need to find an episode where both Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman are listed as writers. From the table, this occurs in:\n  - Row 87: \"scream\" written by Jeff Astrof & Matt Goldman.\n\n### Step 4: Verify Episode Title\n- The title of the episode in Row 87 is indeed \"scream\".\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim states that the episode written by Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman is named \"scream\".
