    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"the maverick be the visitor in over 7 of the list game\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure**: \n   - The table has columns: `date`, `visitor`, `score`, `home`, `leading scorer`, `attendance`, and `record`.\n   - Each row represents a game with details such as date, visitor team, score, home team, leading scorer, attendance, record, etc.\n\n2. **Identify the Relevant Column**: \n   - The claim involves determining when \"maverick\" is the visitor.\n   - Therefore, we need to focus on the `visitor` column.\n\n3. **Count the Occurrences of \"Mavericks\" as Visitor**:\n   - We will iterate through each row in the data and count how many times \"mavericks\" appears in the `visitor` column.\n\n4. **Compare Count with 7**:\n   - The claim states that \"the maverick be the visitor in over 7 of the list game\".\n   - This means we need more than 7 occurrences for the claim to be TRUE.\n\n5. **Perform the Calculation**:\n   - Let's go through each row and count:\n\n     - Row 1: `visitor` is \"mavericks\"\n     - Row 2: `visitor` is \"mavericks\"\n     - Row 3: `visitor` is not \"mavericks\" (it's \"bucks\")\n     - Row 4: `visitor` is not \"mavericks\" (it's \"grizzlies\")\n     - Row 5: `visitor` is \"mavericks\"\n     - Row 6: `visitor` is \"mavericks\"\n     - Row 7: `visitor` is not \"mavericks\" (it's \"trail blazers\")\n     - Row 8: `visitor` is \"mavericks\"\n     - Row 9: `visitor` is \"mavericks\"\n     - Row 10: `visitor` is \"mavericks\"\n     - Row 11: `visitor` is \"mavericks\"\n     - Row 12: `visitor` is \"mavericks\"\n     - Row 13: `visitor` is not \"mavericks\" (it's \"bulls\")\n     - Row 14: `visitor` is \"mavericks\"\n\n   - Total occurrences of \"mavericks\" as the visitor = 10\n\n6. **Determine the Truth Value**:\n   - Since \"mavericks\" appears as the visitor in 10 games, which is more than 7, the claim is TRUE.\n\n7. **List Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells are those where `visitor` is \"mavericks\", corresponding to rows: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table's 'visitor' column was examined for each game.
