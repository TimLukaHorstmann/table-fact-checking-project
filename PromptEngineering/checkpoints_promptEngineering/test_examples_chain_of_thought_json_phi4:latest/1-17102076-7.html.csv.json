    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about game 35's score is true, we will follow a step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim**: The claim states that the score of game 35 was \"L 90 - 98 (OT)\".\n\n2. **Locate Game 35 in the Table**:\n   - We need to find the entry corresponding to row index 34 (since JSON arrays are zero-indexed, and the first data point is at index 0).\n\n3. **Extract Relevant Information from Row Index 34**:\n   - Check the \"score\" column for game 35.\n\n4. **Verify the Score**:\n   - According to the table, row index 34 has the following details:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"game\": 35,\n       \"date\": \"january 5\",\n       \"team\": \"new jersey\",\n       \"score\": \"l 90 - 98 (ot)\",\n       \"high points\": \"kevin martin (36)\",\n       \"high rebounds\": \"kenny thomas (8)\",\n       \"high assists\": \"brad miller (8)\",\n       \"location attendance\": \"izod center 12314\",\n       \"record\": \"8 - 27\"\n     }\n     ```\n   - The \"score\" for game 35 is indeed \"l 90 - 98 (ot)\".\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the extracted score matches the claim, the statement about the score of game 35 is TRUE.\n\nNow we will present this reasoning in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the claim which states that the score for game 35 was 'L 90 - 98 (OT)'. Locate game 35 in the table by finding row index 34. Extract the score from the 'score' column for this row. The extracted score is 'l 90 - 98 (ot)', which matches the claim. Therefore, the statement about the score of game 35 is TRUE.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 34,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
