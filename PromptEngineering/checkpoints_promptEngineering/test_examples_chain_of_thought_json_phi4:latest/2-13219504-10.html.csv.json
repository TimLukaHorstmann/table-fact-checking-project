    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Jehan Mubarak be on the team that get 9th and 10th place\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant rows of data from the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Rows for 9th and 10th Place:**\n   - The row corresponding to \"9th\" place is:\n     - `wicket`: \"9th\"\n     - `runs`: 27\n     - `partnerships`: \"jimmy kamande / rajesh bhudia\"\n     - `venue`: \"durban\"\n     - `date`: \"2007 - 09 - 12\"\n\n   - The row corresponding to \"10th\" place is:\n     - `wicket`: \"10th\"\n     - `runs`: 18\n     - `partnerships`: \"majid haq / dewald nel\"\n     - `venue`: \"durban\"\n     - `date`: \"2007 - 09 - 12\"\n\n2. **Check for Jehan Mubarak's Involvement:**\n   - Look through the table to identify any rows where \"jehan mubarak\" appears in the `partnerships` column.\n   - Jehan Mubarak is mentioned in two instances:\n     - Row with `wicket`: \"7th\"\n       - `partnerships`: \"jehan mubarak / gayan wijekoon\"\n     - Row with `wicket`: \"8th\"\n       - `partnerships`: \"jehan mubarak / chaminda vaas\"\n\n3. **Compare Jehan Mubarak's Rows to 9th and 10th Place:**\n   - Jehan Mubarak is not listed in the partnerships for either the 9th or 10th place:\n     - For 9th place, the partnership is \"jimmy kamande / rajesh bhudia\".\n     - For 10th place, the partnership is \"majid haq / dewald nel\".\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Jehan Mubarak does not appear in the partnerships for either the 9th or 10th places, he was not on the team that achieved these placements.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Jehan Mubarak is mentioned in the partnerships for the 7th and 8th places but not for the 9th or 10th. Therefore, he was not part of the teams that reached the 9th and 10th positions.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"partnerships\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"partnerships\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"partnerships\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
