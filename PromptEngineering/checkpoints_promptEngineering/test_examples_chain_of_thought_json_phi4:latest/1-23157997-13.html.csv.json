Chad Gerlach losing the mountains classification.\n     2. Thomas Soladay being in the points classification for both instances.\n\n2. **Checking Part 1: Chad Gerlach losing the mountains classification**:\n   - Look at the \"mountains classification\" column to see if Chad Gerlach ever holds it and then loses it.\n   - In row 3, Kenneth Hanson wins, replacing Tom Zirbel in the mountain classification.\n   - In row 4, Kenneth Hanson continues to hold the mountain classification, not Chad Gerlach.\n   - In row 5, Chad Gerlach wins the mountains classification for the first time.\n   - In row 6, Chad Gerlach retains the mountains classification.\n   - Since Chad Gerlach never loses the mountain classification (he only wins it in rows 5 and 6), this part of the claim is FALSE.\n\n3. **Checking Part 2: Thomas Soladay being in the points classification both times**:\n   - Look at the \"points classification\" column to see if Thomas Soladay holds it consistently.\n   - In row 1, Tom Zirbel holds the points classification.\n   - From rows 2 to 6, Thomas Soladay consistently holds the points classification.\n   - Since there are no instances where Thomas Soladay loses the points classification, this part of the claim is TRUE.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The first part of the claim about Chad Gerlach losing the mountains classification is FALSE.\n   - The second part of the claim regarding Thomas Soladay being in the points classification both times is TRUE.\n   - Since the entire claim requires both parts to be true, and one part is false, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - For Chad Gerlach losing mountains: \n     - Row 3: Kenneth Hanson wins (mountains classification)\n     - Row 4: Kenneth Hanson retains (mountains classification)\n     - Row 5: Chad Gerlach wins (mountains classification)\n     - Row 6: Chad Gerlach retains (mountains classification)\n   - For Thomas Soladay in points:\n     - Rows 2 to 6: Thomas Soladay consistently holds the points classification.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Chad Gerlach never loses the mountains classification as he only wins it in rows 5 and 6, making this part of the claim FALSE.
