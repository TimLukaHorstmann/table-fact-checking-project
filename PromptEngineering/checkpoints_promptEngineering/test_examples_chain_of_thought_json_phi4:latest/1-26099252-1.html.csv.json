From the table:\n\n- The relevant row for Konqueror has:\n  - Browser: Konqueror\n  - Operating System: All supported\n  - Latest Stable Release: 4.11.2 (1 October 2013)\n  - Theora: 4.4\n  - H264: 4.4\n  - VP8 (WebM): 4.4\n  - VP9 (WebM): No\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Claim\n\nThe claim states two things:\n1. Konqueror supports VP8 (WebM) version 4.4.\n2. Konqueror does not support VP9 (WebM).\n\n### Step 3: Validate Against Table Data\n\n- **VP8 (WebM)**: The cell in the table for \"Konqueror\" under the column \"vp8 (webm)\" indicates a value of \"4.4\". This confirms that Konqueror supports VP8 (WebM) version 4.4.\n  \n- **VP9 (WebM)**: The corresponding entry for \"vp9 (webm)\" is listed as \"no\", indicating that Konqueror does not support VP9 (WebM).\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nThe information in the table supports both parts of the claim:\n- Konqueror supports VP8 (WebM) version 4.4.\n- Konqueror does not support VP9 (WebM).\n\nThus, the claim is **TRUE**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the row for Konqueror in the table.
