    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the equestrian events at the Asian Games occurring every four years from 1982 to 2010, except for 1990, is true or false, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Years in the Table:**\n   - The table provides data for the following years: 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010.\n\n2. **Calculate Intervals Between Events:**\n   - From 1982 to 1986: 4 years\n   - From 1986 to 1994: 8 years\n   - From 1994 to 1998: 4 years\n   - From 1998 to 2002: 4 years\n   - From 2002 to 2006: 4 years\n   - From 2006 to 2010: 4 years\n\n3. **Check for Regular Four-Year Intervals:**\n   - The claim states that the events should occur every four years.\n   - There is a gap of 8 years between 1986 and 1994, which breaks the regular four-year interval pattern.\n\n4. **Verify Exception for 1990:**\n   - The claim mentions an exception in 1990, implying no event was held that year.\n   - However, there is no entry for 1990 in the table, but also no event listed for 1988 either, which would be expected if events were held every four years from 1986.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim about a regular four-year interval with an exception in 1990 does not hold because there is a larger gap (8 years) between 1986 and 1994.\n   - Additionally, the absence of entries for both 1988 and 1990 suggests irregular scheduling rather than a simple skipped year.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Listed the years in the table: 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010.\",\n    \"Calculated intervals between consecutive events: 4, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4 years.\",\n    \"Identified an irregular interval of 8 years between 1986 and 1994.\",\n    \"Checked the claim's exception for 1990; no event listed for 1988 or 1990, indicating irregular scheduling.\",\n    \"Concluded that the claim is false due to the irregular intervals.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
