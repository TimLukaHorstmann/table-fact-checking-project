    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"in the 1981 open championship no player finished under par\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data for any scores indicating a performance below par.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand Par in Golf:**\n   - In golf, \"par\" represents the number of strokes set as the standard for a course.\n   - A score at \"par\" means performing exactly at the expected level (e.g., 70 strokes), while scores below par are indicated by negative numbers like \"-1,\" \"-2\", etc.\n\n2. **Review Table Structure:**\n   - The table lists players, their respective countries, scores, and how they fared relative to par (\"to par\").\n   - Relevant columns for our analysis are \"score\" and \"to par\".\n\n3. **Examine 'To Par' Column:**\n   - We need to check the \"to par\" column in each row to identify if any player scored below par (i.e., any entry less than \"e\", which denotes even or at par).\n\n4. **Analyzing Each Entry:**\n   - Row 1 and 2 (\"t1\"):\n     - Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez and Nick Job both have a \"to par\" score of \"e\" (even), indicating they finished at par.\n   - Rows 3 to 8 (\"t3\"):\n     - Isao Aoki, David Graham, Tony Jacklin, Johnny Miller, Simon Owen, and Hal Sutton all have a \"to par\" score of \"+1\", which is above par.\n   - Rows 9 to 16 (\"t9\"):\n     - Howard Clark, Ben Crenshaw, David Jagger, Mark James, Greg Norman, Arnold Palmer, Bill Rogers, and Sam Torrance all have a \"to par\" score of \"+2\", indicating scores above par.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - No player in the table has a \"to par\" score below \"e\". Thus, no players finished under par according to this data.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis, the claim that \"no player finished under par\" is true for the 1981 Open Championship as represented by this table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The 'to par' column in each row was examined to identify any scores below par.
