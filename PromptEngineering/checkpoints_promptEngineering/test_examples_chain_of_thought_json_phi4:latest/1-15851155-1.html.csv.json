We need to find the row corresponding to the \"air force institute of technology.\"\n\n2. **Locate the specific attributes**:\n   - Look for the row where the school name is \"air force institute of technology.\"\n   - Check the \"control\" column in this row to determine if it is marked as \"private\" or \"public.\"\n   - Check the \"founded\" column in this row to find out the year the institution was founded.\n\n3. **Verify against the claim**:\n   - The claim states that the Air Force Institute of Technology is a private institute founded in 1889.\n   - Compare the extracted control type and founding year from the table with those mentioned in the claim.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - If both the control type and founding year match the claim, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\n### Extracted Information:\n\n- From the row for \"air force institute of technology\":\n  - The control type is \"public.\"\n  - The founded year is 1919.\n\n### Comparison with the Claim:\n\n- **Control Type**: The table lists the Air Force Institute of Technology as \"public,\" while the claim states it is \"private.\" These do not match.\n- **Founding Year**: The table shows the founding year as 1919, whereas the claim mentions 1889.
