    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the lowest attendance game was played against New Jersey Devils\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the data provided in the table with a focus on the \"visitor\" column (to identify games where New Jersey played as the visitor) and the \"attendance\" column. Here are the detailed steps:\n\n1. **Identify Games Where New Jersey Played as Visitor:**\n   - Review each row to determine when \"new jersey\" is listed in the \"visitor\" column.\n\n2. **Extract Attendance Figures for Those Games:**\n   - For games where New Jersey is the visitor, note the attendance figures from the \"attendance\" column.\n\n3. **Compare All Attendance Figures:**\n   - Look through all attendance entries to find the lowest number overall.\n\n4. **Check if Lowest Attendance Corresponds to a Visitor Game Against New Jersey:**\n   - Determine if the game with the lowest attendance involved New Jersey as the visitor.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Games Where New Jersey Played as Visitor:**\n   - November 3rd: new jersey vs. ny rangers (Attendance: 18200)\n   - November 10th: new jersey vs. ny islanders (Attendance: 15361)\n\n2. **Extract Attendance Figures for These Games:**\n   - From the identified visitor games:\n     - November 3rd: 18200\n     - November 10th: 15361\n\n3. **Compare All Attendance Figures in the Table:**\n   - November 2: 14523\n   - November 3: 18200 (New Jersey Visitor)\n   - November 5: 14032\n   - November 8: 14948\n   - November 10: 15361 (New Jersey Visitor)\n   - November 12: 17096\n   - November 14: 17625\n   - November 16: 15076\n   - November 17: 19621\n   - November 21: 17132\n   - November 23: 18545\n   - November 24: 19077\n   - November 28: 13665\n   - November 30: 15081\n\n4. **Find the Lowest Attendance Figure:**\n   - The lowest attendance in all games listed is 13665 on November 28 against Dallas.\n\n5. **Check If This Game Involved New Jersey as Visitor:**\n   - On November 28, New Jersey was the home team (not visitor), so this game does not meet the condition of involving New Jersey as the visitor with the lowest attendance.\n\nSince the game with the lowest attendance did not involve New Jersey as the visiting team, the claim is FALSE. \n\n### Final Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify games where New Jersey played as visitor: November 3rd and November 10th.\",\n    \"Extract attendance figures for these visitor games: 18200 and 15361 respectively.\",\n    \"Compare all attendance entries to find the lowest: 13665 on November 28 against Dallas.\",\n    \"Check if this game involved New Jersey as a visitor: No, they were home team.\",\n    \"Conclusion: The lowest attendance did not occur in a game where New Jersey was the visiting team.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
