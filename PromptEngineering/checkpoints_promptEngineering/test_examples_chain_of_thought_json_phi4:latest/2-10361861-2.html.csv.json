    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the highest number of crowd attendance was in week 7\" is true or false, we need to compare the attendance numbers for each week provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Extract Attendance Data:**\n   - We will go through each entry in the `data` array and extract the `attendance` values along with their corresponding `week`.\n\n2. **List Attendance by Week:**\n   - Week 1: 44,773\n   - Week 2: 46,460\n   - Week 3: 59,983\n   - Week 4: 80,291\n   - Week 5: 47,583\n   - Week 6: 46,751\n   - Week 7: 44,487\n   - Week 8: 56,191\n   - Week 9: 52,060\n   - Week 10: 46,264\n   - Week 11: 46,032\n   - Week 12: 47,234\n   - Week 13: 30,936\n   - Week 14: 65,649\n   - Week 15: 42,202\n   - Week 16: 51,064\n\n3. **Identify the Maximum Attendance:**\n   - Compare all attendance numbers to find the maximum.\n   - The highest attendance is 80,291 in Week 4.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim for Week 7:**\n   - Check the attendance for Week 7: 44,487.\n   - Since 44,487 (Week 7) is not the highest number when compared to other weeks, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells include the attendance numbers for all weeks and specifically for Week 4 and Week 7.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that the highest number of crowd attendance was in week 7 is FALSE.

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"week 8 have 5796 more crowd attend than week 10\" is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Data for Week 8:**\n   - Look at the row corresponding to \"week 8\" in the data.\n   - The relevant column here is \"attendance.\"\n   - From the table, for week 8:\n     - Date: October 26, 1980\n     - Opponent: Green Bay Packers\n     - Result: l 16 - 3\n     - Attendance: 56191\n\n2. **Identify the Data for Week 10:**\n   - Look at the row corresponding to \"week 10\" in the data.\n   - Again, focus on the \"attendance\" column.\n   - From the table, for week 10:\n     - Date: November 9, 1980\n     - Opponent: Detroit Lions\n     - Result: w 34 - 0\n     - Attendance: 46264\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Attendance:**\n   - Subtract the attendance of week 10 from the attendance of week 8.\n   - Calculation: 56191 (week 8) - 46264 (week 10) = 9927\n\n4. **Compare the Calculated Difference with the Claimed Difference:**\n   - The claim states that week 8 had 5796 more attendees than week 10.\n   - We calculated a difference of 9927, which does not match the claimed difference of 5796.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the calculated difference (9927) is not equal to the claimed difference (5796), the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's compile this into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the attendance for week 8 as 56191 and for week 10 as 46264.
