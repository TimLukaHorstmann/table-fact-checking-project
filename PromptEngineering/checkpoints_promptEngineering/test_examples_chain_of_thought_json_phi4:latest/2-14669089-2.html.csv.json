It is found at row index 1:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"name\": \"kwadukuza egoli hotel tower 1 , trust bank building\",\n       \"city\": \"johannesburg\",\n       \"years as tallest\": \"1970 - 1973\",\n       \"metres\": 140.0,\n       \"feet\": 459,\n       \"floors\": 31\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Verify the Number of Floors:**\n   - The claim states that this building has 31 floors.\n   - From the table, we see it indeed has 31 floors.\n\n3. **Verify the Period as Tallest:**\n   - The claim mentions that the building was the tallest from 1970 to 1973.\n   - According to the table, \"years as tallest\" for this building is \"1970 - 1973,\" which matches the claim.\n\n4. **Cross-Check with Other Buildings:**\n   - Ensure no other buildings were taller during this period:\n     - The next entry in the table after this building (row index 2) is \"standard bank building\":\n       ```json\n       {\n         \"name\": \"standard bank building\",\n         \"city\": \"johannesburg\",\n         \"years as tallest\": \"1968 - 1970\",\n         \"metres\": 138.8,\n         \"feet\": 455,\n         \"floors\": 34\n       }\n       ```\n     - The standard bank building was the tallest from 1968 to 1970, not overlapping with 1970 to 1973.\n     - The next entry after that (row index 0) is \"carlton centre\":\n       ```json\n       {\n         \"name\": \"carlton centre\",\n         \"city\": \"johannesburg\",\n         \"years as tallest\": \"1973 - present\",\n         \"metres\": 223.0,\n         \"feet\": 732,\n         \"floors\": 50\n       }\n       ```\n     - The carlton centre became the tallest in 1973, which does not affect the period from 1970 to 1973.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the data, \"kwadukuza egoli hotel tower 1, trust bank building\" was indeed the tallest from 1970 to 1973 and has 31 floors.\n   - Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify 'kwadukuza egoli hotel tower 1, trust bank building' in the table at row index 1.\",\n    \"Verify it has 31 floors as claimed, which matches the data.\",\n    \"Check that its 'years as tallest' is '1970 - 1973', matching the claim.\",\n    \"Cross-check with adjacent buildings to ensure no other building was taller during this period.\",\n    \"The standard bank building was tallest from 1968-1970, and the carlton centre from 1973 onwards.\",\n    \"Thus, kwadukuza egoli hotel tower 1, trust bank building was indeed the tallest from 1970 to 1973.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"floors\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
