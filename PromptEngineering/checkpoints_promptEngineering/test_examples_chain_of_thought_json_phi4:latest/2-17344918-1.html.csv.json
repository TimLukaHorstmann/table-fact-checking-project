    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"4 - 1 be the 2nd leg for 2004\" is TRUE or FALSE, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Year:**\n   - We need to locate the row corresponding to the year 2004 in the table.\n\n2. **Check Winner and Opponent:**\n   - For the year 2004, check which team won and who was the runner-up (runners-up) to ensure that we are looking at the correct match data.\n\n3. **Verify Aggregate Score:**\n   - Confirm the aggregate score listed for this year's match to ensure consistency with other data points.\n\n4. **Locate 1st and 2nd Leg Scores:**\n   - Find the scores of both the first leg and second leg matches for the year 2004.\n   \n5. **Determine if \"4 - 1\" is the 2nd Leg Score:**\n   - Specifically check the score listed under the \"2nd leg\" column to see if it is \"4 - 1.\"\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- From the table, locate the row where the year is 2004.
