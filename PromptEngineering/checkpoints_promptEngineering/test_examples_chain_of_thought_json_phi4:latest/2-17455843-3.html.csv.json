The relevant rows for initial matches are those with \"tie no\" and those without a \"replay\".\n   \n2. **Count Home Wins**:\n   - For each game, check if the home team has won. This occurs when the score is in favor of the home team.\n\n3. **Calculate Percentage of Home Wins**:\n   - Calculate the percentage of games where the home team wins by dividing the number of home wins by the total number of games with outcomes and multiplying by 100.\n\n4. **Evaluate Claim**:\n   - Determine if this calculated percentage is approximately 60%.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n- **Total Games**: \n  - Initial matches (rows without \"replay\"): Rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17. \n  - Total: 17 games.\n\n- **Home Wins**:\n  - Game 2: Watford (3 - 1)\n  - Game 3: Walsall (4 - 0)\n  - Game 6: Southport (0 - 4) [away win]\n  - Game 7: Scarborough (6 - 4)\n  - Game 8: Notts County (0 - 1) [away win]\n  - Game 10: Fulham (4 - 0)\n  - Game 12: Brentford (1 - 0)\n  - Game 13: Bristol Rovers (4 - 2)\n  - Game 14: Carlisle United (4 - 2)\n  - Game 15: Crystal Palace (6 - 0)\n  - Game 17: Gateshead (3 - 2)\n\n- **Count of Home Wins**:\n  - Total home wins = 9\n\n- **Percentage Calculation**:\n  - Percentage of home wins = (9 / 17) * 100 \u2248 52.94%\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe percentage of games won by the home team is approximately 53%, which is less than 60%.
