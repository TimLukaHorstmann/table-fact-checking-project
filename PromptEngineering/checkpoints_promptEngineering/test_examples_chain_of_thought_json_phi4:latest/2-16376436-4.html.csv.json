    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, let's analyze each part of it by examining the data provided in the table:\n\n1. **Identify Games in September**:\n   - We need to find all games played in September 1990. According to the \"date\" column, these are:\n     - Week 1: September 9, 1990\n     - Week 2: September 16, 1990\n     - Week 3: September 23, 1990\n     - Week 4: September 30, 1990\n\n   So, there are only four games in September.\n\n2. **Check the Scores for Each Game**:\n   - For each game identified above, we will check the \"result\" column to verify if any match the scores mentioned in the claim:\n\n     - **Week 1 (September 9, 1990)**: Result is \"w 14 - 9\"\n     - **Week 2 (September 16, 1990)**: Result is \"w 17 - 13\"\n     - **Week 3 (September 23, 1990)**: Result is \"w 20 - 3\"\n     - **Week 4 (September 30, 1990)**: Result is \"w 24 - 10\"\n\n   None of these results match the scores mentioned in the claim.\n\n3. **Check All Scores Mentioned in the Claim**:\n   - The claim mentions five specific scores: \n     - w 23 - 20\n     - w 38 - 31\n     - w 24 - 7\n     - w 28 - 24\n     - w 17 - 12\n\n   Let's verify these against the \"result\" column in the entire dataset:\n   \n   - **w 23 - 20**: Found in Week 13 (December 2, 1990)\n   - **w 38 - 31**: Found in Week 14 (December 10, 1990)\n   - **w 24 - 7**: Found in Week 15 (December 16, 1990)\n   - **w 28 - 24**: Found in Week 16 (December 22, 1990)\n   - **w 17 - 12**: Found in Week 17 (December 30, 1990)\n\n   None of these scores occurred in September.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states that all five games with the specified scores occurred in September.
