    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the highest point total for any player in 1 game be 12\" is true or false, we need to analyze the data provided in the table under the column labeled \"high points.\" This column contains information about the highest number of points scored by a single player in each game.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:** The claim pertains to the \"high points\" column since it involves the point totals for players.\n2. **Examine Each Entry:**\n   - Game 29 (March 2): Fern\u00e1ndez scored 19 points.\n   - Game 30 (March 5): Allen scored 24 points.\n   - Game 31 (March 11): Moore scored 23 points.\n   - Game 32 (March 12): Wyatt scored 15 points.\n   - Game 33 (March 17): Both Moore and Fern\u00e1ndez scored 23 points.\n\n3. **Compare with Claim:** \n   - The claim states that the highest point total for any player in a single game should be 12.\n   - From our examination, we see the following highest scores: 19, 24, 23, 15, and 23 points. All these values exceed 12.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since there are entries where players scored more than 12 points, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nWe need to list all cells in the \"high points\" column since they contain the relevant data for this evaluation:\n\n- Game 29: Fern\u00e1ndez - 19 points\n- Game 30: Allen - 24 points\n- Game 31: Moore - 23 points\n- Game 32: Wyatt - 15 points\n- Game 33: Moore / Fern\u00e1ndez - 23 points\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim is evaluated by examining the 'high points' column to determine if any player scored more than 12 points in a single game.
