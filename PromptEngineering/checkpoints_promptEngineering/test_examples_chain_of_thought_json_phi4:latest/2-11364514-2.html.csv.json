    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the lord of ring musical be nominate for best effect\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the provided table step by step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information**: The claim states that \"the lord of ring musical be nominate for best effect\". We need to check if there is any entry in the table related to a nomination for \"best effect\".\n\n2. **Examine the Table Structure**:\n   - The table has columns: \"year\", \"award\", \"category\", \"nominee\", and \"result\".\n   - Each row represents an award category and its associated nominee.\n\n3. **Search for \"Best Effect\" in the Category Column**:\n   - We need to look at each entry under the \"category\" column to find any mention of \"best effect\".\n\n4. **Review Each Row**:\n   - Row 1: Category is \"best new musical\". This does not match \"best effect\".\n   - Row 2: Category is \"best set design\". This does not match \"best effect\".\n   - Row 3: Category is \"best costume design\". This does not match \"best effect\".\n   - Row 4: Category is \"best lighting design\". This does not match \"best effect\".\n   - Row 5: Category is \"best sound design\". This does not match \"best effect\".\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - There is no row in the table where the category is \"best effect\".
