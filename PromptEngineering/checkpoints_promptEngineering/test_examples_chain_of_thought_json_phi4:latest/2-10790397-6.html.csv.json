This crowd size (30,000) is the largest.\n3. The next largest crowd size is at Western Oval with 20,000.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the Crowd Size for Punt Road Oval\n- Look through the \"venue\" column in the data to find matches for \"punt road oval.\"\n- In Row 2, \"venue\" is \"punt road oval,\" and \"crowd\" is 30,000.\n- This confirms part of the claim that Punt Road Oval has a crowd size of 30,000.\n\n#### Step 2: Verify if 30,000 is the Largest Crowd\n- Compare the \"crowd\" values for all rows:\n  - Row 1: 13,000 (Lake Oval)\n  - Row 2: 30,000 (Punt Road Oval)\n  - Row 3: 14,000 (Brunswick Street Oval)\n  - Row 4: 20,000 (Western Oval)\n  - Row 5: 32,000 (Princes Park)\n  - Row 6: 18,000 (Arden Street Oval)\n\n- The largest crowd is actually at Princes Park with 32,000, not Punt Road Oval.\n\n#### Step 3: Verify the Next Largest Crowd Size\n- After identifying the largest crowd size, check for the next largest:\n  - Punt Road Oval has a crowd of 30,000.\n  - Western Oval has a crowd of 20,000.\n  \n- The second-largest crowd is indeed at Punt Road Oval (30,000), followed by Western Oval (20,000).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim that \"Punt Road Oval have a crowd of 30000, the biggest 1 with Western Oval next at 20000\" is false because Punt Road Oval does not have the largest crowd.
