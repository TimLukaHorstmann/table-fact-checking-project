Whether the Richcraft - Dow Honda Site Tower (I and II) are \"tall.\"\n  2. Whether these towers are \"currently under construction.\"\n\n### Step 2: Check Construction Status\n- We need to find any entries in the table with the status \"under construction\" for the buildings mentioned:\n  - **Richcraft - Dow Honda Site Tower I**: The row indicates it is \"proposed,\" not \"under construction.\"\n  - **Richcraft - Dow Honda Site Tower II**: Similarly, this row also shows \"proposed.\"\n\n### Step 3: Check Floors (Tallness)\n- Although the claim mentions \"tall building,\" no specific height data are provided in the table. We can infer tallness from the number of floors:\n  - Both Richcraft towers have 48 floors.\n  - Other buildings under construction with fewer floors include:\n    - **150 Elgin**: 23 floors\n    - **Claridge Plaza III**: 28 floors\n    - **Tribeca I**: 27 floors\n    - **Tribeca II**: 27 floors\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n- The Richcraft towers are proposed, not under construction.\n- Therefore, they cannot be the tallest building \"currently under construction.\"\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that 'the richcraft - dow honda site tower be the tall building currently under construction.'
