No mention of Ivor Bueb.\n   - **Row 2 (1957)**: Entrant is \"gilby engineering ltd\". No mention of Ivor Bueb.\n   - **Row 3 (1958)**: Entrant is \"bc ecclestone\". No mention of Ivor Bueb.\n   - **Row 4 (1958)**: Entrant is \"ecurie demi litre\". No mention of Ivor Bueb.\n   - **Row 5 (1959)**: Entrant is \"british racing partnership\". No mention of Ivor Bueb.\n   - **Row 6 (1959)**: Entrant is \"british racing partnership\". No mention of Ivor Bueb.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - None of the rows from 1957 to 1959 list \"ivor bueb\" as an entrant.\n   - Since there are no entries for Ivor Bueb, he effectively scored zero points during these years by default.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - The claim is true because there is no record of Ivor Bueb scoring any points between 1957 and 1959 in the table.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was examined for entries from 1957 to 1959.

The claim states that Ivor Bueb raced both the Lotus 12 chassis multiple times between 1957 and 1959.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: \n   - We are interested in entries related to the \"Lotus 12\" chassis.\n   - The time frame specified is from 1957 to 1959.\n\n2. **Check for Lotus 12 Entries**:\n   - Look through each entry's \"year\", \"entrant\", and \"chassis\" fields within the given years (1957, 1958, 1959).\n\n3. **Review Each Entry**:\n   - **1957**: \n     - No entries with \"Lotus 12\".\n   - **1958**:\n     - There is one entry: `[\"ecurie demi litre\", \"lotus 12\", \"climax straight - 4\"]`.\n   - **1959**:\n     - No entries with \"Lotus 12\".\n\n4. **Determine Frequency**:\n   - The Lotus 12 chassis appears only once in the entire dataset, specifically in the year 1958.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim mentions that Ivor Bueb raced the Lotus 12 multiple times.\n   - There is no mention of Ivor Bueb in the table at all.\n   - The Lotus 12 was only used once during the specified period, not multiple times.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the Lotus 12 appears only once and there's no data about Ivor Bueb, the claim cannot be true.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows that the Lotus 12 chassis was used only once in 1958. There is no mention of Ivor Bueb racing this chassis or any other entry multiple times between 1957 and 1959.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"entrant\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"chassis\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
