From the table:\n   - The entry with `date` as \"may 12\" and `opponent` as \"twins\" (since Royals play against Twins, not Blue Jays) is found.\n\n2. **Check the opponent**: The claim mentions a game against the \"toronto blue jay\", but the table shows that on May 12th, the Royals played against the \"twins\".\n\n3. **Verify the outcome and record**:\n   - According to the table, on May 12, the score was \"3 - 1\" with the loss attributed to \"cerutti (1 - 2)\".\n   - The `record` column shows \"18 - 12\" after this game.\n\n4. **Check for any mention of Blue Jays**: There is no entry involving a game against the Toronto Blue Jays on May 12th in the table data provided.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since there was no game between the Kansas City Royals and the Toronto Blue Jays on May 12, the claim about affecting the Blue Jays' record cannot be true.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim involves a game between the Royals and the Blue Jays on May 12th.\",\n    \"The table entry for May 12 shows a game against the Twins, not the Blue Jays.\",\n    \"After this game, the Royals' record is '18 - 12'.\",\n    \"There is no mention of a game involving the Blue Jays in the data provided.\",\n    \"Therefore, the claim about affecting the Blue Jays' record is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
