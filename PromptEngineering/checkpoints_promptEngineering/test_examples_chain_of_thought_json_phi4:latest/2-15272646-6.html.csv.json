    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify if the player mentioned was indeed the winner on two specific dates and the runner-up on another date according to the dataset.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Dates and Roles:**\n   - The claim specifies three events:\n     - Winner on 6 August 2006.\n     - Winner on 18 September 2009.\n     - Runner-up on 3 April 2010.\n\n2. **Locate Data for Each Date:**\n   - For each specified date, we will check the dataset to find entries that match the event type (Winner or Runner-up) and the corresponding player(s).\n\n3. **Check 6 August 2006:**\n   - Locate the entry with the date \"6 august 2006\".\n   - Verify if the role is \"winner\" and note the players involved.\n\n4. **Check 18 September 2009:**\n   - Locate the entry with the date \"18 september 2009\".\n   - Confirm if the role is \"winner\" and identify the player(s).\n\n5. **Check 3 April 2010:**\n   - Find the entry for \"3 april 2010\".\n   - Ensure the role is \"runner-up\" and check the players.\n\n6. **Compare Players Across Events:**\n   - Determine if the same player(s) are involved in all three events as per the roles specified (winner or runner-up).\n\n7. **Draw Conclusion:**\n   - If the same player(s) appear in all specified roles on these dates, the claim is true.\n   - Otherwise, it is false.\n\n### Data Verification:\n\n- **6 August 2006:**\n  - Date: \"6 august 2006\"\n  - Role: \"winner\"\n  - Player: Carly Gullickson\n  - Relevant Entry: Row 21\n\n- **18 September 2009:**\n  - Date: \"18 september 2009\"\n  - Role: \"winner\"\n  - Player: Marina Erakovic\n  - Relevant Entry: Row 37\n\n- **3 April 2010:**\n  - Date: \"3 april 2010\"\n  - Role: \"runner-up\"\n  - Players: Mallory Cecil, Jamie Hampton (no single player matches the previous winners)\n  - Relevant Entry: Row 46\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe players for each event are different.
