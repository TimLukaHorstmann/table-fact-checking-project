    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to evaluate two conditions based on the provided table:\n\n1. **Condition 1:** Less than 3 teams have a negative goal difference.\n2. **Condition 2:** More than 5 teams have scored more goals against them.\n\nLet's analyze each condition step-by-step using the relevant data from the table:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Goal Difference\n- The \"difference\" column indicates the goal difference for each team (goals scored minus goals conceded).\n- A negative value in this column means that a team has conceded more goals than it has scored.\n\n**Check for Negative Goal Differences:**\n- **Portuguesa:** Difference = \"-10\"\n- **Vasco da Gama:** Difference = \"-2\"\n- **S\u00e3o Paulo:** Difference = \"-13\"\n\nFrom the data, we can see that there are 3 teams with a negative goal difference (row indices 4, 6, and 8).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Goals Conceded\n- The \"against\" column indicates the number of goals each team has conceded.\n\n**Check for Teams with More Goals Conceded than Scored:**\n- A team has scored more goals against them if their \"points\" (goals scored) are less than their \"against\" (goals conceded).\n\nLet's evaluate each team:\n- **Flamengo:** Points = 13, Against = 12 \u2192 13 > 12 (Not more goals conceded)\n- **Fluminense:** Points = 13, Against = 15 \u2192 13 < 15 (More goals conceded)\n- **Corinthians:** Points = 9, Against = 15 \u2192 9 < 15 (More goals conceded)\n- **Palestra Italia:** Points = 8, Against = 19 \u2192 8 < 19 (More goals conceded)\n- **Portuguesa:** Points = 7, Against = 23 \u2192 7 < 23 (More goals conceded)\n- **Botafogo:** Points = 6, Against = 25 \u2192 6 < 25 (More goals conceded)\n- **Vasco da Gama:** Points = 6, Against = 19 \u2192 6 < 19 (More goals conceded)\n- **Am\u00e9rica:** Points = 6, Against = 25 \u2192 6 < 25 (More goals conceded)\n- **S\u00e3o Paulo:** Points = 4, Against = 24 \u2192 4 < 24 (More goals conceded)\n\nFrom the data, we can see that there are 7 teams with more goals scored against them than they have scored (row indices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8).\n\n### Conclusion\n- **Condition 1:** There are exactly 3 teams with a negative goal difference. The claim states \"less than 3,\" so this condition is FALSE.\n- **Condition 2:** There are more than 5 teams with more goals scored against them.
