    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"a Michigan State player was drafted in the third round\" is true or false, we need to analyze the data provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:**\n   - The relevant columns for this claim are:\n     - `round`: Indicates which round of the draft.\n     - `college`: Shows where the player attended college.\n   \n2. **Examine Each Row for the Third Round:**\n   - We need to find rows where the `round` column has a value of 3.\n\n3. **Check College Information:**\n   - For each row identified in step 2, check if the `college` is \"michigan state\".\n\n4. **Data Analysis:**\n\n   - **Row 1:** \n     - `round`: 1\n     - `college`: \"michigan state\"\n     - This player was drafted in the first round, not the third.\n\n   - **Row 2:**\n     - `round`: 3\n     - `name`: \"ricky ervins\"\n     - `college`: \"southern california\"\n     - This is a player from the third round but from Southern California, not Michigan State.\n\n   - **Rows 3 to 9:** \n     - These rows have rounds of 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. None are relevant for the third round.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - There is no row where a player from \"michigan state\" was drafted in the third round.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table contains multiple rounds of draft picks. We focused on rows with 'round' equal to 3 and checked if any player from these rows attended 'michigan state'. The only third-round pick was from 'southern california', not 'michigan state'. Hence, no Michigan State player was drafted in the third round.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
