This means we need to see if there are exactly 10 entries where `type` is \"end of contract\" and no transfer fee (indicating a non-transfer movement).\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **End of Contract Entries:**\n  - Nicholas Gallacher\n  - Lacine Cherif\n  - Alistair Park\n  - Michael Donald\n  - Calum Reidford\n  - Chris Smith\n  - Jeroen van den Broeck\n\n- Total entries with `type` as \"end of contract\": 7\n\n- **Transfer Entries:**\n  - Filip \u0160ebo (1 million)\n  - Thomas Buffel (N/A fee)\n  - Carlos Cu\u00e9llar (7.8 million)\n  - Daniel Cousin (3.5 million)\n  - Jean-Claude Darcheville (free, winter transfer)\n  - Chris Burke (free, winter transfer)\n\n- **Transfer with N/A Fee:**\n  - Thomas Buffel is marked as a transfer but has an \"N/A\" fee.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- There are 7 players whose movement type is \"end of contract\".\n- None of these have a specified transfer fee that would indicate a transfer.\n- The claim states there should be 10 such cases, but we only find 7.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the entries with 'type' as 'end of contract'.
