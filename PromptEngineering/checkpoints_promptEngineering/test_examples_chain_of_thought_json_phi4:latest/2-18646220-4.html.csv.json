    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Viktor Melantiev of Russia and Nivalter Santos of Brazil are tied for second to last place\" is true or false, let's analyze the table data step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Total Number of Athletes:**\n   - The table contains 7 rows of athletes, which means there are 7 participants in total.\n\n2. **Determine Last Place:**\n   - In a list of 7 participants, the last place is occupied by the athlete in position 7.\n   - According to the data:\n     ```json\n     [\n       7,\n       \"mikhail yemelyanov\",\n       \"kazakhstan\",\n       \"4:19.259\",\n       \"qs\"\n     ]\n     ```\n   - Mikhail Yemelyanov is in last place.\n\n3. **Determine Second to Last Place:**\n   - The second to last position would be the athlete ranked 6th.\n   - According to the data:\n     ```json\n     [\n       6,\n       \"nivalter santos\",\n       \"brazil\",\n       \"4:17.407\",\n       \"qs\"\n     ]\n     ```\n   - Nivalter Santos is in second to last place.\n\n4. **Check Position of Viktor Melantiev:**\n   - According to the data:\n     ```json\n     [\n       5,\n       \"viktor melantiev\",\n       \"russia\",\n       \"4:03.316\",\n       \"qs\"\n     ]\n     ```\n   - Viktor Melantiev is ranked 5th.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Viktor Melantiev and Nivalter Santos are tied for second to last place.\n   - However, from the data:\n     - Nivalter Santos is in 6th place (second to last).\n     - Viktor Melantiev is in 5th place.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false because Viktor Melantiev is not tied with Nivalter Santos for second to last place.
