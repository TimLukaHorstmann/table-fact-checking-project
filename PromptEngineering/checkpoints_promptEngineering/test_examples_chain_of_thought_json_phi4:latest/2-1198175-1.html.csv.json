His college is LSU.\n\n5. **Verify the Claim about High School**:\n   - The claim includes a specific high school: CA Technical High School.\n   - Since Joseph Barksdale\u2019s entry lacks any mention of attending this school and instead lists his college as LSU, this part of the claim cannot be verified or supported by the table data.\n\n6. **Check if Joseph Barksdale is the Heaviest Player**:\n   - Compare the weight of Joseph Barksdale (325 lbs) with other players.\n   - From the data entries:\n     - Thomas Sidney Sims weighs 288 lbs at position dt/nt.\n     - Will Campbell weighs 311 lbs at position og.\n     - All other players listed weigh less than 325 lbs.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Joseph Barksdale is indeed the heaviest player according to the weights provided in the table.\n   - However, the claim about his high school (CA Technical High School) is not supported by the data since no such information is given for him.\n\n8. **Final Assessment of the Claim**:\n   - Since part of the claim regarding CA Technical High School cannot be verified with the table's provided information, the entire claim is false.\n\nNow, let\u2019s format this reasoning into a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim states Joseph Barksdale attended CA Technical High School and is the heaviest player.\",\n    \"Locate Joseph Barksdale in the data to find his high school information and weight.\",\n    \"Joseph Barksdale's row shows no mention of CA Technical High School, only LSU as college.\",\n    \"Compare Joseph Barksdale's weight (325 lbs) with other players' weights.\",\n    \"Barksdale is indeed the heaviest player listed.\",\n    \"However, the high school part of the claim cannot be verified or supported.\",\n    \"Thus, the entire claim is false due to unsupported information about his high school.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"weight (lbs)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
