    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the attendance varies each time Minnesota is the home team\" is true or false, we need to examine the rows where Minnesota is listed as the home team in the provided table.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Minnesota as Home Team:**\n   - We look for entries where the \"home\" column has \"minnesota\". These are:\n     - October 4: Visitor = Chicago\n     - October 6: Visitor = Columbus\n     - October 10: Visitor = Edmonton\n     - October 13: Visitor = Phoenix (out of Minnesota)\n     - October 14: Visitor = Anaheim\n     - October 16: Visitor = Los Angeles\n     - October 20: Visitor = St. Louis\n     - October 21: Visitor = Colorado\n     - October 24: Visitor = Calgary\n     - October 25: Visitor = Edmonton (out of Minnesota)\n     - October 28: Visitor = Colorado\n     - October 30: Visitor = Pittsburgh (out of Minnesota)\n\n2. **Extract Attendance Values for Relevant Rows:**\n   - For the games where Minnesota is the home team, extract attendance values:\n     - October 4: Attendance = 18568\n     - October 6: Attendance = 18568\n     - October 10: Attendance = 18568\n     - October 14: Attendance = 17174\n     - October 16: Attendance = 14239\n     - October 20: Attendance = 19150\n     - October 21: Attendance = 18568\n     - October 24: Attendance = 19289\n     - October 25: Attendance = 16839\n     - October 28: Attendance = 17041\n\n3. **Check for Variability in Attendance:**\n   - We need to check if the attendance numbers vary across these entries.\n   - The attendance values are:\n     - 18568, 18568, 18568, 17174, 14239, 19150, 18568, 19289, 16839, 17041\n   - These values show variability. For instance, 18568 appears multiple times, but there are other distinct numbers like 17174, 14239, etc.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since not all attendance figures are the same (they vary), the claim that \"the attendance varies each time Minnesota is the home team\" is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- We identified relevant cells where Minnesota is the home team and extracted their attendance values:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified rows where Minnesota is the home team.
