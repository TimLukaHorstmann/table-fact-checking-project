    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to find a season where the team's win percentage was approximately 0.72 (or 72%) and they suffered exactly 23 losses.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:**\n   - Win Percentage = 0.72 \u2192 This means that out of all games played, 72% were won.\n   - Losses = 23\n\n2. **Calculate Total Games from Given Wins and Losses:**\n   - Let \\( W \\) be wins and \\( L \\) be losses.\n   - Total Games \\( T = W + L \\).\n   - Win Percentage is calculated as \\( \\frac{W}{T} = 0.72 \\).\n\n3. **Express Wins in Terms of Losses:**\n   - From the win percentage formula:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{W}{W + L} = 0.72\n     \\]\n   - Rearrange to find \\( W \\):\n     \\[\n     W = 0.72(W + L)\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\( L = 23 \\) into the equation:\n     \\[\n     W = 0.72(W + 23)\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\( W \\):\n     \\[\n     W = 0.72W + 16.56\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     W - 0.72W = 16.56\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     0.28W = 16.56\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     W = \\frac{16.56}{0.28} \\approx 59.14\n     \\]\n\n4. **Check for Integer Values:**\n   - Since wins must be an integer, round \\( W \\) to the nearest whole number: \\( W = 59 \\).\n\n5. **Calculate Total Games with Rounded Wins:**\n   - Total Games \\( T = W + L = 59 + 23 = 82 \\).\n\n6. **Verify Win Percentage:**\n   - Calculate win percentage:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Win Percentage} = \\frac{W}{T} = \\frac{59}{82} \\approx 0.7195\n     \\]\n   - This is approximately 0.72.\n\n7. **Check Data for Matching Season:**\n   - Look through the data for a season with \\( W = 59 \\) and \\( L = 23 \\).\n\n8. **Identify Relevant Cell:**\n   - In the year \"1994-95\", the team has:\n     - Wins = 59\n     - Losses = 23\n     - Win Percentage = 0.720\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is true for the season \"1994-95\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim, calculate the win percentage using the given losses and check against the data.
