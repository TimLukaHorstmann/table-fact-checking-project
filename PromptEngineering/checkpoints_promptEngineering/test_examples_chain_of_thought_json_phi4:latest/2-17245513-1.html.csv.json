Row index 6:\n        - Place: t7\n        - Player: Jack Nicklaus\n        - Money: $7500\n     2. Row index 7:\n        - Place: t7\n        - Player: Peter Oosterhuis\n        - Money: $7500\n\n4. **Verify the Claim Against Table Data:**\n   - For Peter Oosterhuis (Row index 7):\n     - `place` is \"t7\"\n     - `player` is \"Peter Oosterhuis\"\n     - `money` is \"$7500\"\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - All parts of the claim match the data in the table for Peter Oosterhuis at row index 7.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe claim is TRUE based on the information provided in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Peter Oosterhuis placed t7 and won $7500.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Peter Oosterhuis having a place of \"t7\" and money amount of 10875 is true or false, we need to analyze the table data.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Player's Row:**\n   - We are looking for the row corresponding to \"Peter Oosterhuis\".\n   - From the table, Peter Oosterhuis is listed in a row with:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"place\": \"t7\",\n       \"player\": \"peter oosterhuis\",\n       \"country\": \"england\",\n       \"score\": \"69 + 73 + 72 + 75 = 289\",\n       \"to par\": \"+ 5\",\n       \"money\": \"7500\"\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Check the Claimed Place:**\n   - The claim states that Peter Oosterhuis is at place \"t7\".\n   - From step 1, we see that his place in the table is indeed \"t7\".\n\n3. **Check the Claimed Money Amount:**\n   - The claim further specifies that he has a money amount of \"10875\".\n   - However, from the row data for Peter Oosterhuis, the money column shows \"7500\".\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - While the place \"t7\" is correctly identified in the claim, the money amount does not match.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false because the money amount of 10875 does not correspond to Peter Oosterhuis.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The row for Peter Oosterhuis shows a place of 't7' and a money amount of '7500'.
