    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"higher and higher song garnered an advanced result during top 10 week\" is TRUE or FALSE, we will follow a step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim:** The claim states that the song \"Higher and Higher\" achieved an \"advanced\" result during the \"top 10\" week.\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Data:**\n   - We need to find entries in the table where both the \"theme\" (or related column) is \"top 10\" and the \"song choice\" is \"higher and higher\".\n   \n3. **Check Each Row for Conditions:**\n   - Examine each row of data in the table to see if it matches the conditions:\n     - **Row 1:** \n       - \"week\": audition\n       - \"theme\": chicago\n       - \"song choice\": walking on the moon\n       - Does not match.\n     \n     - **Row 2:**\n       - \"week\": vegas verdicts\n       - \"theme\": n/a\n       - \"song choice\": living for the city\n       - Does not match.\n\n     - **Row 3:** \n       - \"week\": top 20\n       - \"theme\": group 2\n       - \"song choice\": higher and higher\n       - Partially matches (only song choice), but theme is \"group 2\", not \"top 10\".\n\n     - **Row 4:**\n       - \"week\": top 10\n       - \"theme\": n/a\n       - \"song choice\": bring it on home to me\n       - Does not match.\n\n     - **Row 5:**\n       - \"week\": top 8\n       - \"theme\": heroes\n       - \"song choice\": easy\n       - Does not match.\n\n     - **Row 6:**\n       - \"week\": top 4\n       - \"theme\": judges' choice contestant's choice\n       - \"song choice\": can't help falling in love sir duke\n       - Does not match.\n\n     - **Row 7:**\n       - \"week\": finale\n       - \"theme\": duets\n       - \"song choice\": red red wine\n       - Does not match.\n\n4. **Conclusion from Data Check:**\n   - The song \"higher and higher\" appears in row 3, but it is during the \"top 20\" week, not the \"top 10\" week.\n   - There is no entry where \"higher and higher\" is performed during the \"top 10\" week.\n\n5. **Result of Conditions:**\n   - Since there is no match for both conditions (week being \"top 10\" and song choice being \"higher and higher\"), the claim is FALSE.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells Identification:**\n   - The relevant cells that confirm our conclusion are those from row 3, which contains the data about the performance of \"higher and higher\", and row 4, which confirms no such performance happened in \"top 10\".\n\nThus, based on this reasoning, we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that 'Higher and Higher' song garnered an advanced result during the 'top 10' week.
