This information is located in the \"grid\" column of the table.\n\n2. **Locate Gerhard Berger's Grid Position**:\n   - Scan through the data to find the entry for \"Gerhard Berger\".\n   - From the table, we find:\n     ```\n     [\n       \"gerhard berger\",\n       \"benetton - renault\",\n       67,\n       \"+ 16.416\",\n       7\n     ]\n     ```\n   - Gerhard Berger's grid position is **7**.\n\n3. **Locate Olivier Panis's Grid Position**:\n   - Next, find the entry for \"Olivier Panis\".\n   - From the table, we see:\n     ```\n     [\n       \"olivier panis\",\n       \"prost - mugen - honda\",\n       67,\n       \"+ 43.750\",\n       11\n     ]\n     ```\n   - Olivier Panis's grid position is **11**.\n\n4. **Compare the Grid Positions**:\n   - A lower number in the grid indicates a better starting position (closer to pole position).\n   - Gerhard Berger started at position **7**, while Olivier Panis started at position **11**.\n   - Since 7 is less than 11, Gerhard Berger indeed started before Olivier Panis.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim \"Gerhard Berger was able to start the race before Olivier Panis\" is TRUE because Gerhard Berger's grid position (7) is numerically lower than that of Olivier Panis (11), indicating he started ahead in the race lineup.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim involves comparing starting grid positions.
