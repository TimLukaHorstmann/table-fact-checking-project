From our examination:\n   - Only one vessel (marianarray) has a length of \"17 m\", which is different.\n   - Therefore, only one vessel does not meet the \"20 m\" criteria, while the claim allows for up to two.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since there is only one vessel with a different length and the claim allows for two, the statement holds true.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that all vessels except two should have a length of '20 m'.
