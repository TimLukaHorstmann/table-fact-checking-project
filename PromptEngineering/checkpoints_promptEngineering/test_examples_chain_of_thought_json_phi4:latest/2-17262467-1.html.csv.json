    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Carlos Kirmayr does not win a championship between 1976 and 1980\" is true or false, we need to analyze the data provided in the table for any instance of Carlos Kirmayr winning a championship during that period.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Time Period**: The claim specifies the years from 1976 to 1980. We will focus on entries within these years.\n\n2. **Examine Each Entry**:\n   - Look at each row in the table and check the \"date\" column for entries between 1976 and 1980.\n   - For each entry, examine the \"outcome\" column to determine if Carlos Kirmayr won a championship (i.e., if the outcome is not \"runner-up\").\n\n3. **Analyze Entries**:\n   - **1976**: The outcome is \"runner-up\", so no win here.\n   - **1979**: The outcome is \"runner-up\", so no win here.\n   - **1980**: The outcome is \"runner-up\", so no win here.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: There are no entries in the table where Carlos Kirmayr won a championship between 1976 and 1980. All relevant entries list him as \"runner-up\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis, there are no records of Carlos Kirmayr winning a championship from 1976 to 1980 according to the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was checked for any championships won by Carlos Kirmayr between 1976 and 1980.
