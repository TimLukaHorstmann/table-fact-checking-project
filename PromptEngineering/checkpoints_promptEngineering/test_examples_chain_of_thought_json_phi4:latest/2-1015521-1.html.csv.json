    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the aircraft bell 212 twin huey be a trainer type\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data for the relevant row associated with the Bell 212 Twin Huey.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Aircraft in Question:**\n   - We are interested in the aircraft named \"bell 212 twin huey\".\n\n2. **Locate the Row Containing the Aircraft:**\n   - By examining the table's data, we find that there is a row with \"bell 212 twin huey\" as its entry under the \"aircraft\" column.\n\n3. **Determine the Type of the Aircraft:**\n   - Once the correct row is located, check the corresponding entry in the \"type\" column for this aircraft.\n   - The row related to \"bell 212 twin huey\" lists the type as \"transport / utility\".\n\n4. **Compare with the Claimed Type:**\n   - The claim states that the Bell 212 Twin Huey should be of \"trainer type\".\n   - Comparing this with the information from the table, we see a discrepancy because the type given is \"transport / utility\", not \"trainer\".\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the type in the table does not match the claimed type (\"trainer\"), the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The Bell 212 Twin Huey row indicates its type as 'transport / utility'.
