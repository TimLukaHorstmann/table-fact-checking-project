    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the celtic only play 1 game on a Thursday in December\" is true or false, we need to analyze the provided table to identify all games played by the Celtics on Thursdays during December.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: We need to check each row of the data for games that occurred on a Thursday and have \"boston garden\" as the location since this is where the Boston Celtics play their home games.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - **Row 0 (Game 15)**: Date is Saturday, December 1; not relevant.\n   - **Row 1 (Game 16)**: Date is Sunday, December 2; not relevant.\n   - **Row 2 (Game 17)**: Date is Tuesday, December 4; location is Pontiac Silverdome; not a home game.\n   - **Row 3 (Game 18)**: Date is Wednesday, December 5; location is Boston Garden; not a Thursday.\n   - **Row 4 (Game 19)**: Date is Saturday, December 8; not relevant.\n   - **Row 5 (Game 20)**: Date is Sunday, December 9; not relevant.\n   - **Row 6 (Game 21)**: Date is Tuesday, December 11; location is Hartford Civic Center; not a home game.\n   - **Row 7 (Game 22)**: Date is Wednesday, December 12; location is The Spectrum; not a Thursday.\n   - **Row 8 (Game 23)**: Date is Friday, December 14; location is Boston Garden; not a Thursday.\n   - **Row 9 (Game 24)**: Date is Saturday, December 15; not relevant.\n   - **Row 10 (Game 25)**: Date is Tuesday, December 18; location is Madison Square Garden; not a home game.\n   - **Row 11 (Game 26)**: Date is Wednesday, December 19; location is Boston Garden; not a Thursday.\n   - **Row 12 (Game 27)**: Date is Friday, December 21; location is Boston Garden; not a Thursday.\n   - **Row 13 (Game 28)**: Date is Saturday, December 22; location is Chicago Stadium; not a home game.\n   - **Row 14 (Game 29)**: Date is Wednesday, December 26; location is Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum; not a Thursday.\n   - **Row 15 (Game 30)**: Date is Thursday, December 27; location is Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena; not a home game.\n   - **Row 16 (Game 31)**: Date is Saturday, December 29; not relevant.\n   - **Row 17 (Game 32)**: Date is Sunday, December 30; location is The Mecca; not a Thursday.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \n   - There is only one game listed on a Thursday in December (row 15), but it was an away game at Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena.\n   - Therefore, the Celtics did not play any home games on a Thursday in December.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Checked each row for games played by the Celtics on Thursdays in December.
