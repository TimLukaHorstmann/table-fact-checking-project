    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"it may come as a surprise, but Dartmouth College ranks higher than the University of T\u00fcbingen\" is true or false, we need to compare their rankings across different ranking systems mentioned in the table: WUR 2013, ARWU 2013, and QS 2013. \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify Dartmouth College Rankings**:\n   - From the table, locate Dartmouth College.\n   - **WUR 2013**: 126th\n   - **ARWU 2013**: 151-200th\n   - **QS 2013**: 113th\n\n2. **Identify University of T\u00fcbingen Rankings**:\n   - From the table, locate University of T\u00fcbingen.\n   - **WUR 2013**: 201-225th\n   - **ARWU 2013**: 151-200th\n   - **QS 2013**: 144th\n\n3. **Compare Rankings**:\n   - For WUR 2013, Dartmouth College is ranked 126th, which is higher than University of T\u00fcbingen's range of 201-225th.\n   - For ARWU 2013, both institutions fall within the same rank range (151-200th). Therefore, they are considered equivalent for this ranking system.\n   - For QS 2013, Dartmouth College is ranked 113th, which is higher than University of T\u00fcbingen's 144th.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - In two out of the three ranking systems (WUR and QS), Dartmouth College has a better rank compared to University of T\u00fcbingen.\n   - Therefore, the claim that Dartmouth College ranks higher than the University of T\u00fcbingen is true based on these rankings.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify Dartmouth College Rankings: WUR 2013: 126th, ARWU 2013: 151-200th, QS 2013: 113th.\",\n    \"Identify University of T\u00fcbingen Rankings: WUR 2013: 201-225th, ARWU 2013: 151-200th, QS 2013: 144th.\",\n    \"Compare Rankings: For WUR 2013, Dartmouth (126th) ranks higher than University of T\u00fcbingen (201-225th).\",\n    \"For ARWU 2013, both are within the same range (151-200th), so they are equivalent for this ranking.\",\n    \"For QS 2013, Dartmouth (113th) ranks higher than University of T\u00fcbingen (144th).\",\n    \"Conclusion: Dartmouth College ranks higher in two out of three systems, supporting the claim.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the University of Western Australia (UWA) doing better overall than Durham University despite its later establishment date is true or false, we need to compare their rankings across the three different ranking systems mentioned: WUR 2013, ARWU 2013, and QS 2013. We'll analyze these rankings while considering their years of establishment.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Establishment Years**:\n   - University of Western Australia was established in 1911.\n   - Durham University was established in 1832.\n   - UWA is indeed established later than Durham University, as stated in the claim.\n\n2. **Collect Rankings for Each University**:\n   - For the University of Western Australia:\n     - WUR 2013: 168th\n     - ARWU 2013: 91st\n     - QS 2013: 134th\n\n   - For Durham University:\n     - WUR 2013: 80th\n     - ARWU 2013: 201-300th\n     - QS 2013: 90th\n\n3. **Compare Rankings**:\n   - **WUR 2013**: \n     - UWA is ranked 168th, while Durham University is ranked 80th.\n     - Durham ranks better in WUR.\n   \n   - **ARWU 2013**: \n     - UWA is ranked 91st, within the range of 201-300 for Durham. Since UWA has a specific ranking and it's at the upper end of the range for Durham, we can infer UWA likely ranks better here.\n   \n   - **QS 2013**: \n     - UWA is ranked 134th, while Durham University is ranked 90th.\n     - Durham ranks better in QS.\n\n4. **Overall Comparison**:\n   - In WUR and QS rankings, Durham University has a higher (better) rank than the University of Western Australia.\n   - In ARWU, the University of Western Australia seems to rank better or at least not worse than Durham University when considering the range provided for Durham.\n   - Since two out of three ranking systems show Durham having a superior position and only one shows UWA potentially doing better, overall, Durham University performs better in the rankings.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that \"University of Western Australia does better, overall, than Durham University despite its late date of establishment\" is FALSE.
