We need to find this specific row in the data.\n\n2. **Locate the Date and Location**:\n   - Check each entry for the \"date\" column to find \"6 February 2000\".\n   - Verify that the corresponding \"location\" is \"Wellington, New Zealand\".\n\n3. **Verify the Surface Type**: Ensure that the surface type in this row is \"hard\".\n\n4. **Check the Opponent's Name**: Once we locate the correct row based on date, location, and surface, check the \"opponent in final\" column to see if it matches \"Katerina Kramperov\u00e1\".\n\n5. **Cross-Reference with Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the opponent on this specific occasion was \"Katerina Kramperov\u00e1\".\n   - Compare this with the actual data from the identified row.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the table:\n\n1. Locate the row with \"date\" as \"6 February 2000\":\n   - This matches row index 2 in the data array.\n\n2. Verify the location for this date:\n   - The \"location\" is indeed \"Wellington, New Zealand\".\n\n3. Confirm the surface type:\n   - The \"surface\" is listed as \"hard\".\n\n4. Check the opponent's name:\n   - The \"opponent in final\" is \"Mirielle Dittmann\", not \"Katerina Kramperov\u00e1\".\n\n5.
