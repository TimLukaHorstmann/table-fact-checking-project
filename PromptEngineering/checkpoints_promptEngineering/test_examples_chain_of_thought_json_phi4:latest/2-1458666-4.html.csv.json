    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"all 12 nations that have a win at the World Golf Championship have at least 1 team win\" is TRUE or FALSE, let's analyze the table step by step:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understanding the Table Structure**:\n   - The table lists nations with their respective statistics: total wins, team wins, individual wins, and individual winners.\n   - Each row corresponds to a nation.\n\n2. **Identifying Nations with Wins**:\n   - We are interested in all 12 nations that have at least one win (total wins \u2265 1).\n\n3. **Checking Team Wins for Each Nation**:\n   - For each nation, we will check the \"team wins\" column to see if it is greater than or equal to 1.\n\n4. **Analyzing Each Row**:\n   - United States: Total wins = 32, Team wins = 1 (Has at least 1 team win)\n   - Australia: Total wins = 5, Team wins = 0 (Does not have a team win)\n   - England: Total wins = 5, Team wins = 1 (Has at least 1 team win)\n   - South Africa: Total wins = 4, Team wins = 2 (Has at least 1 team win)\n   - Northern Ireland: Total wins = 2, Team wins = 0 (Does not have a team win)\n   - Germany: Total wins = 2, Team wins = 1 (Has at least 1 team win)\n   - Canada: Total wins = 1, Team wins = 0 (Does not have a team win)\n   - Fiji: Total wins = 1, Team wins = 0 (Does not have a team win)\n   - Sweden: Total wins = 1, Team wins = 0 (Does not have a team win)\n   - Italy: Total wins = 1, Team wins = 0 (Does not have a team win)\n   - Japan: Total wins = 1, Team wins = 1 (Has at least 1 team win)\n   - Wales: Total wins = 1, Team wins = 1 (Has at least 1 team win)\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Nations with total wins but no team wins are Australia, Northern Ireland, Canada, Fiji, Sweden, and Italy.\n   - Since these nations have total wins but zero team wins, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells for this analysis are those under the \"team wins\" column where the value is 0 for nations with at least one win:\n\n- Australia: row_index = 1, column_name = \"team wins\"\n- Northern Ireland: row_index = 4, column_name = \"team wins\"\n- Canada: row_index = 6, column_name = \"team wins\"\n- Fiji: row_index = 7, column_name = \"team wins\"\n- Sweden: row_index = 8, column_name = \"team wins\"\n- Italy: row_index = 9, column_name = \"team wins\"\n\n### Final JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim is FALSE because there are nations with total wins but zero team wins.
