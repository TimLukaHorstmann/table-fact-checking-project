The surface is \"hard\".\n- **Row 2 to Row 7:** None have the date \"October 10, 2004\", nor do they mention Auckland, New Zealand.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- There is no entry in the table for \"October 10, 2004\" at \"Auckland, New Zealand\".\n- Therefore, we cannot verify or find any information about the playing surface on that specific date and location.\n\nThe claim is based on incorrect assumptions since there is no data supporting it. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Check for an entry with 'October 10, 2004' in the 'date' column.\\n2.
