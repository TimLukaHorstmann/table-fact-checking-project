    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"every team have several wins\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data for each entry related to teams and their wins.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: \n   - The claim states that every team has multiple (several) wins.\n   - This implies that for each unique team in the table, there should be more than one win recorded across all seasons and series they participated in.\n\n2. **Identifying Unique Teams**:\n   - From the data, we identify the teams: \n     - BVM Minardi Team\n     - Manor Motorsport\n     - BVM - Target Racing\n     - S Fortec Motorsport\n\n3. **Checking Wins for Each Team**:\n\n   - **BVM Minardi Team**:\n     - 2007 Formula Renault 2.0 Italy: 0 wins\n     - 2007 Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0: 0 wins\n     - 2007 Formula Renault 2.0 Italy - Winter Series: 4 wins\n     - 2008 Formula Renault 2.0 Italy: 0 wins\n     - 2008 Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0: 0 wins\n     - Total Wins = 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 4 wins\n\n   - **Manor Motorsport**:\n     - 2009 Formula 3 Euro Series: 0 wins\n     - 2009 Masters of Formula 3: 0 wins\n     - Total Wins = 0 + 0 = 0 wins\n\n   - **BVM - Target Racing**:\n     - 2010 Italian Formula Three Championship: 3 wins\n     - Total Wins = 3 wins\n\n   - **S Fortec Motorsport**:\n     - 2011 Formula Renault 3.5 Series: 0 wins\n     - Total Wins = 0 wins\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - BVM Minardi Team has several wins (4).\n   - BVM - Target Racing has several wins (3).\n   - Manor Motorsport and S Fortec Motorsport do not have any wins.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false because not every team has several wins.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells are those containing the \"wins\" data for each team across different seasons and series.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim 'every team have several win' is evaluated by checking the number of wins for each unique team in the table. BVM Minardi Team has 4 wins, BVM - Target Racing has 3 wins, but Manor Motorsport and S Fortec Motorsport have 0 wins. Since not every team has multiple wins, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
