This confirms one honorable mention.\n     - Row 3: 10th golden screen awards, category is \"best actor in a supporting role\", nominated work is \"oros\", result is \"won\". This does not count as an honorary mention; it's a win.\n   - Conclusion: Kristofer Martin received only one honorary mention for best supporting actor in \"Oros\" in 2013.\n\n2. **Check if he won best actor in a supporting role for \"Oros\" at the FAMAS Award:**\n   - Look for entries where the category is \"best actor in a supporting role\", nominated work is \"oros\", and the award giving body is \"FAMAS awards\".\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 3 confirms he won best actor in a supporting role for \"Oros\" at the 10th golden screen awards, not FAMAS.\n     - Row 6: FAMAS awards, category is \"german moreno youth achievement award\", result is \"won\". This does not match the claim about best actor in a supporting role.\n   - Conclusion: He did not win best actor in a supporting role for \"Oros\" at the FAMAS Award.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- The first part of the claim is FALSE because he received only one honorable mention, not two.\n- The second part of the claim is FALSE because he did not win best actor in a supporting role for \"Oros\" at the FAMAS Award.\n\nBased on this analysis, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 2: (2013, \"16th long island international film expo\", \"honorable mention for best supporting actor\", \"oros\", \"won\")\n- Row 3: (2013, \"10th golden screen awards\", \"best actor in a supporting role\", \"oros\", \"won\")\n- Row 6: (2012, \"famas awards\", \"german moreno youth achievement award\", \"n / a\", \"won\")\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states Kristofer Martin received two honorary mentions for best supporting actor in 'Oros' in 2013 and won best actor in a supporting role for 'Oros' at the FAMAS Award.
