    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to verify if Tony Mendoza was an opponent in an event where the duration was 2:41.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Opponent:**  \n   The claim specifies that Tony Mendoza is the opponent. We need to locate entries in the table where the \"opponent\" column matches \"tony mendoza\".\n\n2. **Locate Entries with Tony Mendoza as Opponent:**\n   - Scan through the data rows and find entries where the \"opponent\" value is \"tony mendoza\".\n   - From the provided table, we identify:\n     ```json\n     [\n       3, // Row index in the table data array\n       \"4 - 0\",\n       \"tony mendoza\",\n       \"tko (punches)\",\n       \"wfc : rumble in the rockies\",\n       1,\n       \"2:41\",\n       \"loveland , colorado , united states\"\n     ]\n     ```\n\n3. **Check the Event Duration:**  \n   - Verify if the \"time\" column for this row matches \"2:41\".\n   - In the identified row, the \"time\" is indeed \"2:41\".\n\n4. **Verify Result of the Match:**  \n   - Confirm that the result (\"res\") associated with Tony Mendoza as an opponent is a \"win\", which it is in this case.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**  \n   The entry for Tony Mendoza matches all conditions specified by the claim: he was an opponent, and the event lasted 2:41 minutes.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe claim is TRUE based on the analysis above.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Locate entries with 'tony mendoza' as the opponent.\\n2. Identify row where the duration ('time') is '2:41'.\\n3.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Tony Mendoza being an opponent at a specific event time is true or false, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Record of Tony Mendoza:**\n   - Look for the row where \"opponent\" is listed as \"tony mendoza.\"\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Details from This Row:**\n   - Check the values in columns such as \"method,\" \"event,\" \"round,\" and \"time\" to confirm any details pertaining to this match.\n\n3. **Verify the Claimed Time Against Extracted Data:**\n   - Compare the time extracted from Tony Mendoza's row with the claimed time of \"2:49.\"\n\nLet\u2019s go through these steps using the data provided:\n\n1. **Find Tony Mendoza in the Data:**\n\n   We search for a match where the \"opponent\" is \"tony mendoza.\" This occurs at:\n   - Row Index 10 (considering zero-based indexing)\n\n2. **Extract Details from Tony Mendoza's Match:**\n   - Method: \"tko (punches)\"\n   - Event: \"wfc : rumble in the rockies\"\n   - Round: 1\n   - Time: \"2:41\"\n\n3. **Compare Extracted Time with Claimed Time:**\n\n   The time for Tony Mendoza's match is \"2:41,\" not \"2:49\" as claimed.\n\nSince the actual recorded time does not match the claimed time, we conclude that the claim is false.\n\nHere\u2019s the final JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The opponent 'tony mendoza' appears in row 10.
