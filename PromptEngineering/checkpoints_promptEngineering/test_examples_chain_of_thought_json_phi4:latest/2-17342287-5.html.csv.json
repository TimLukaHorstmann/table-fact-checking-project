    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze the table data step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Games Played at Boston Garden:**\n   - We will look through each row in the \"location / attendance\" column for entries that mention \"boston garden\".\n\n2. **Count the Number of Games at Boston Garden Before December 17:**\n   - For each game identified as being played at Boston Garden, check the corresponding date in the \"date\" column.\n   - Only count those games if the date is on or before December 17.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim Against Our Findings:**\n   - The claim states there are 8 games at Boston Garden, all before December 17. We will verify this by counting and checking the dates of the identified games.\n\nLet's go through each step with relevant data from the table:\n\n- **Row 1:** \n  - Date: December 3\n  - Location: boston garden\n  - This game is at Boston Garden and before December 17.\n\n- **Row 4:** \n  - Date: December 8\n  - Location: boston garden\n  - This game is at Boston Garden and before December 17.\n\n- **Row 5:** \n  - Date: December 11\n  - Location: boston garden\n  - This game is at Boston Garden and before December 17.\n\n- **Row 6:** \n  - Date: December 15\n  - Location: boston garden\n  - This game is at Boston Garden and before December 17.\n\n- **Row 8:** \n  - Date: December 22\n  - Location: boston garden\n  - This game is at Boston Garden but not before December 17.\n\nFrom the analysis, we find that there are only 4 games played at Boston Garden before December 17. The claim states there are 8 such games, which is incorrect based on our findings.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is FALSE because there are only 4 games at Boston Garden before December 17, not 8.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified games played at 'boston garden' and counted those occurring on or before December 17.
