    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"only 2 of the players were selected in the NBA draft in their eligible season\" is true or false, we need to analyze each player's entry in the table regarding their eligibility and selection status.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding Eligibility**: \n   - A college basketball player typically becomes eligible for the NBA Draft after three years of playing in a four-year NCAA program, unless they declare early or graduate early.\n   \n2. **Analyzing Each Player**:\n   - **Alonzo Mourning**:\n     - College: Georgetown (a well-known four-year program).\n     - Drafted: 1st round, 2nd pick of the 1992 draft by the Hornets.\n     - Likely graduated or declared early since he was drafted after playing at a four-year school for at least one year.\n\n   - **Chris Jackson**:\n     - College: LSU (a well-known four-year program).\n     - Drafted: 1st round, 3rd pick of the 1990 draft by the Nuggets.\n     - Likely graduated or declared early since he was drafted after playing at a four-year school for at least one year.\n\n   - **Chris Mills**:\n     - College: Kentucky (a well-known four-year program) and Arizona (another four-year program).\n     - Drafted: 1st round, 22nd pick of the 1993 draft by the Cavs.\n     - Likely graduated or declared early since he was drafted after playing at multiple four-year schools.\n\n   - **Billy Owens**:\n     - College: Syracuse (a well-known four-year program).\n     - Drafted: 1st round, 3rd pick of the 1991 draft by the Kings.\n     - Likely graduated or declared early since he was drafted after playing at a four-year school for at least one year.\n\n   - **Kenny Williams**:\n     - College: Barton CC (a community college) and Elizabeth City State (another two-year program).\n     - Drafted: 2nd round, 46th pick of the 1990 draft by the Pacers.\n     - Likely not eligible until after his third season in a four-year program. His path through multiple two-year schools suggests he declared early.\n\n3. **Determining Eligibility at Time of Draft**:\n   - Players from four-year programs (Mourning, Jackson, Mills, Owens) were likely drafted during their eligibility or after declaring early.\n   - Kenny Williams, who attended community colleges and a two-year program, would not be eligible until completing three years in a four-year program.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - All players except Kenny Williams seem to have been drafted during their eligibility period (either by being eligible or declaring early).\n   - Therefore, more than 2 players were selected during their eligible season.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Analyzing each player's college path and draft year, it is clear that all players except Kenny Williams were drafted during their eligibility period. Players from four-year programs likely declared early or were eligible at the time of their draft.
