    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Amr El-Safty be only 1 of 2 players on the list to not score in the Egyptian Premier League\" is true or false, we need to follow these reasoning steps:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim suggests that Amr El-Safty and one other player did not score any goals in the Egyptian Premier League.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Column**: We are interested in the \"egyptian premier league\" column, as it tracks the number of goals scored by each individual in this specific league.\n\n3. **Locate Amr El-Safty's Data**:\n   - Find the row corresponding to \"amr el - safty\".\n   - In this row, check the value under the \"egyptian premier league\" column.\n   - We find that the number of goals is 0 for Amr El-Safty.\n\n4. **Identify Other Players with Zero Goals in Egyptian Premier League**:\n   - Examine all rows and look at the values under the \"egyptian premier league\" column to identify other players who also have a value of 0.\n   - From the data:\n     - \"amr el - safty\": 0 goals\n     - \"own goals\": 0 goals (This is not an individual player, but a category)\n     - The remaining players all have more than 0 goals in this column.\n\n5. **Count Players with Zero Goals**:\n   - Only Amr El-Safty and the category \"own goals\" have 0 goals in the Egyptian Premier League.\n   - Since \"own goals\" is not an individual player, only Amr El-Safty qualifies as a player with zero goals.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states there are two players who did not score in the Egyptian Premier League. However, only one individual player (Amr El-Safty) fits this criterion.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Amr El-Safty's row for \"egyptian premier league\": `row_index: 15`, `column_name: egyptian premier league`\n- Other players' rows in the \"egyptian premier league\" column to verify they have goals:\n  - Sherif Ashraf: `row_index: 0`, `column_name: egyptian premier league`\n  - Mahmoud Fathallah: `row_index: 1`, `column_name: egyptian premier league`\n  - Junior Agogo: `row_index: 2`, `column_name: egyptian premier league`\n  - Abdel Halim Ali: `row_index: 3`, `column_name: egyptian premier league`\n  - Hani Said: `row_index: 4`, `column_name: egyptian premier league`\n  - Shikabala: `row_index: 5`, `column_name: egyptian premier league`\n  - Gamal Hamza: `row_index: 6`, `column_name: egyptian premier league`\n  - Ahmed Magdy: `row_index: 7`, `column_name: egyptian premier league`\n  - Mostafa Gaafar: `row_index: 8`, `column_name: egyptian premier league`\n  - Alaa Kamal: `row_index: 9`, `column_name: egyptian premier league`\n  - Mahmoud Samir: `row_index: 10`, `column_name: egyptian premier league`\n  - Ricardo Alves Fernandes: `row_index: 11`, `column_name: egyptian premier league`\n  - Sabry Raheel: `row_index: 12`, `column_name: egyptian premier league`\n  - Wisam El Abdy: `row_index: 13`, `column_name: egyptian premier league`\n  - Own Goals: `row_index: 16`, `column_name: egyptian premier league`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim suggests that Amr El-Safty and one other player did not score in the Egyptian Premier League.
