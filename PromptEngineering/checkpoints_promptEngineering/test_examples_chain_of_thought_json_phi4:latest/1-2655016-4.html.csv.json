    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"each of the episode title have letter somewhere within the title\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify if every episode title contains at least one alphabetic character (i.e., a letter). Let's go through each step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: The relevant column for this task is \"episode title\". We will examine each entry in this column.\n\n2. **Check Each Episode Title**:\n   - **Row 0**: \"tia & tamera mowry / ll cool j\" contains letters.\n   - **Row 1**: \"montell jordan\" contains letters.\n   - **Row 2**: \"dru hill\" contains letters.\n   - **Row 3**: \"tyra banks / blackstreet\" contains letters.\n   - **Row 4**: \"music special\" contains letters.\n   - **Row 5**: \"a tribe called quest\" contains letters.\n   - **Row 6**: \"702\" does not contain any letters, only numbers.\n   - **Row 7**: \"tony! toni! tone!\" contains letters.\n   - **Row 8**: \"chris farley / mint condition\" contains letters.\n   - **Row 9**: \"112\" does not contain any letters, only numbers.\n   - **Row 10**: \"john leguizamo / mona lisa\" contains letters.\n   - **Row 11**: \"ray j\" contains letters.\n   - **Row 12**: \"for real\" contains letters.\n   - **Row 13**: \"aaliyah\" contains letters.\n   - **Row 14**: \"az yet\" contains letters.\n   - **Row 15**: \"monica\" contains letters.\n   - **Row 16**: \"mc lyte\" contains letters.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - We found two entries (\"702\" and \"112\") that do not contain any letters, which means the claim is FALSE.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells**: The rows with titles that lack letters are Row 6 and Row 9.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the relevant column 'episode title' for checking each entry.\",\n    \"Check each episode title to see if it contains at least one letter.\",\n    \"Row 0: Contains letters.\",\n    \"Row 1: Contains letters.\",\n    \"Row 2: Contains letters.\",\n    \"Row 3: Contains letters.\",\n    \"Row 4: Contains letters.\",\n    \"Row 5: Contains letters.\",\n    \"Row 6: Does not contain any letters (only numbers '702').\",\n    \"Row 7: Contains letters.\",\n    \"Row 8: Contains letters.\",\n    \"Row 9: Does not contain any letters (only numbers '112').\",\n    \"Row 10: Contains letters.\",\n    \"Row 11: Contains letters.\",\n    \"Row 12: Contains letters.\",\n    \"Row 13: Contains letters.\",\n    \"Row 14: Contains letters.\",\n    \"Row 15: Contains letters.\",\n    \"Row 16: Contains letters.\",\n    \"Conclusion: The claim is FALSE because rows 6 and 9 do not contain any letters.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
