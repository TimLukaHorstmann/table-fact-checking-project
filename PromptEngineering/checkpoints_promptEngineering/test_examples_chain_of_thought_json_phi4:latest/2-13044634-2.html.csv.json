If so, whether it was specifically in the first round.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify all games with rear naked choke submissions:**\n   - We will look for entries under the \"method\" column that mention \"rear naked choke\".\n\n2. **Check the rounds of those specific submissions:**\n   - For each game identified in step 1, we need to check the \"round\" column to determine if it was in the first round.\n\n3. **Count how many games ended with a rear naked choke submission and verify their rounds:**\n   - Confirm if there are exactly two such games.\n   - Verify whether any of these games were not in the first round, specifically checking for the third round as per the claim.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify rear naked choke submissions:**\n   - Entry 4: \"submission (rear naked choke)\", opponent \"mark sinclair\", round 1\n   - Entry 5: \"submission (rear naked choke)\", opponent \"kori trussell\", round 1\n\n2. **Check the rounds for these submissions:**\n   - Both identified games ended in the first round.\n\n3. **Evaluate the claim:**\n   - The claim states that one of the rear naked choke submission games was in the third round, which is not true based on our findings.\n   - There are only two games ending by a rear naked choke, both in the first round.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there are no games that ended with a rear naked choke submission in the third round.

This is not Hammond, Indiana.\n     - Row 3 (Jonatas Novaes): Location is \"Hoffman Estates, Illinois\".
