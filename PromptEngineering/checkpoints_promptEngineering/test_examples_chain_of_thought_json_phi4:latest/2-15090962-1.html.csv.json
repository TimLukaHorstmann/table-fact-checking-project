    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"all of the school be name after the city in which they be locate\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to check if each school's name matches its location (city). We will go through each row in the table and compare these two columns.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Chesterton School**:\n   - Location: Chesterton\n   - School Name: Chesterton\n   - Comparison: The school is named after its city, so this matches.\n\n2. **Crown Point School**:\n   - Location: Crown Point\n   - School Name: Crown Point\n   - Comparison: The school is named after its city, so this matches.\n\n3. **Lake Central School**:\n   - Location: Saint John\n   - School Name: Lake Central\n   - Comparison: The school name \"Lake Central\" does not match the location \"Saint John\", so this does not meet the claim's requirement.\n\n4. **Laporte School**:\n   - Location: Laporte\n   - School Name: Laporte\n   - Comparison: The school is named after its city, so this matches.\n\n5. **Merrillville School**:\n   - Location: Merrillville\n   - School Name: Merrillville\n   - Comparison: The school is named after its city, so this matches.\n\n6. **Michigan City School**:\n   - Location: Michigan City\n   - School Name: Michigan City\n   - Comparison: The school is named after its city, so this matches.\n\n7. **Portage School**:\n   - Location: Portage\n   - School Name: Portage\n   - Comparison: The school is named after its city, so this matches.\n\n8. **Valparaiso School**:\n   - Location: Valparaiso\n   - School Name: Valparaiso\n   - Comparison: The school is named after its city, so this matches.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because \"Lake Central\" does not match the location \"Saint John\".
