    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Jessica Ennis being a guest on Andrew and Jack's episode broadcast on 4 May 2012 is true or false, let\u2019s break down the process step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the Column of Interest**: The table contains columns for \"episode\", \"first broadcast\", \"andrew and jacks guest\", \"jamies guests\", and \"scores\". To verify the claim about the guest appearance, we focus on the \"andrew and jacks guest\" column.\n\n2. **Locate the Specific Episode**: We need to check the details of the episode that aired on 4 May 2012. The relevant entry is under the \"first broadcast\" column for this date.\n\n3. **Find the Broadcast Date in the Table**:\n   - Look through the \"first broadcast\" column for the date \"4 may 2012\".\n   - This corresponds to row index 2 (since it's zero-indexed).\n\n4. **Check the Guest Information**:\n   - Refer to the \"andrew and jacks guest\" column in the same row where \"4 may 2012\" is listed.\n   - The entry for this date shows \"jessica ennis\".\n\n5. **Verify Consistency with the Claim**: \n   - The claim states that Jessica Ennis was the guest on Andrew and Jack's episode broadcast on 4 May 2012.\n   - This matches perfectly with what we found in step 4.\n\nBased on these steps, we conclude that the information supports the claim as true. Here is how this reasoning translates into JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Identify the 'andrew and jacks guest' column for the guest information.\\n2. Locate the episode with a broadcast date of '4 may 2012'.\\n3. Find that it corresponds to row index 2 in the table.\\n4. Check the 'andrew and jacks guest' entry in this row, which is 'jessica ennis'.\\n5. The claim matches this information.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"first broadcast\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"andrew and jacks guest\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to evaluate it step by step.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Key Elements of the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the first broadcast with Jessica Ennis as Andrew and Jack's guest was before May 2012.\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Information in the Table**:\n   - We need to find an entry where \"Jessica Ennis\" is listed under the column \"andrew and jacks guest.\"\n   - Once identified, we will check the date of first broadcast for that particular episode.\n\n3. **Examine the Data Row by Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: Episode 05x01 has Georgie Thompson as the guest.\n   - **Row 2**: Episode 05x02 has Louise Hazel as the guest.\n   - **Row 3**: Episode 05x03 lists Jessica Ennis as the guest. Let's check the \"first broadcast\" column for this row.\n\n4. **Check Date for the Relevant Row**:\n   - For Row 3 (Episode 05x03), the \"first broadcast\" is on \"4 May 2012.\"\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim Against the Information**:\n   - The claim states that the first broadcast with Jessica Ennis as a guest was before May 2012.\n   - However, the date found is \"4 May 2012,\" which is not before May 2012.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the episode featuring Jessica Ennis aired on 4 May 2012 and not before May 2012, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim was evaluated by identifying the row where 'Jessica Ennis' appeared as the guest.
