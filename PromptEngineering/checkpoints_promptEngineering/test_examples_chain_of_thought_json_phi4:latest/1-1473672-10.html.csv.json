We need to check if the \"pick\" value for Rene Lambert is 146.\n\n3. **Check the Position:**\n   - The claim asserts that Rene Lambert plays as a \"right wing.\" We must confirm that his position listed in the table is indeed \"right wing.\"\n\n4. **Cross-reference with Table Data:**\n\n   - Locate Rene Lambert's entry:\n     - Row index 2 (0-based index) contains:\n       ```json\n       {\n         \"pick\": 146,\n         \"player\": \"rene lambert\",\n         \"position\": \"right wing\",\n         \"nationality\": \"canada\",\n         \"nhl team\": \"new york islanders\",\n         \"college / junior / club team\": \"st jerome alouettes (qmjhl)\"\n       }\n       ```\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - The \"pick\" value is 146.\n   - The \"player\" name is \"rene lambert.\"\n   - The \"position\" is listed as \"right wing.\"\n\nAll parts of the claim are verified to be true based on the data provided in the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Rene Lambert plays right wing and was drafted with the 146th pick.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify each component of it against the data provided in the table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **Position:** Right Wing\n2. **Player Name:** Rene Lambert\n3. **Pick Number:** 145th\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Verify Position for Rene Lambert:**\n   - Locate the row where \"player\" is \"rene lambert.\"\n   - According to the table, Rene Lambert's position is \"right wing.\"\n\n2. **Verify Pick Number for Rene Lambert:**\n   - In the same row as above, check the \"pick\" number.\n   - The pick number for Rene Lambert is 146.\n\n3. **Verify Player Name for Pick 145th:**\n   - Locate the row where \"pick\" is 145.\n   - According to the table, the player at pick 145 is Steve Lyon, not Rene Lambert.\n\n4. **Verify Position for Pick 145th:**\n   - In the same row as above, check the position of Steve Lyon.\n   - The position for Steve Lyon is \"defence.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The claim states that Rene Lambert was picked 145th and plays right wing. However, Rene Lambert was actually picked 146th, not 145th.\n- Additionally, the player picked at 145th is Steve Lyon, who plays defence, not right wing.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n1.
