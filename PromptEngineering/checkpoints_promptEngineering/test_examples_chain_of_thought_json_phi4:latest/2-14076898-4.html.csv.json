This means we are looking for a row where:\n   - The `goal difference` is \"11 - 71\".\n   - The corresponding `points` should be 0.\n\n2. **Examine the Table Structure**: \n   - The table has columns: `games`, `drawn`, `lost`, `goal difference`, and `points`.\n   - There are 8 rows of data under these columns.\n\n3. **Search for Relevant Goal Difference**:\n   - We need to scan through each row's `goal difference` column to find the value \"11 - 71\".\n\n4. **Check Corresponding Points**:\n   - Once we locate a row with the goal difference \"11 - 71\", we check its corresponding `points` value.\n   - According to the claim, this should be 0.\n\n5. **Scan Through Data**:\n\n   - Row 1: Goal Difference = \"51 - 10\" \u2192 Not relevant.\n   - Row 2: Goal Difference = \"40 - 13\" \u2192 Not relevant.\n   - Row 3: Goal Difference = \"41 - 19\" \u2192 Not relevant.\n   - Row 4: Goal Difference = \"34 - 25\" \u2192 Not relevant.\n   - Row 5: Goal Difference = \"36 - 29\" \u2192 Not relevant.\n   - Row 6: Goal Difference = \"32 - 27\" \u2192 Not relevant.\n   - **Row 7**: Goal Difference = \"17 - 68\" \u2192 Not relevant.\n   - **Row 8**: Goal Difference = \"11 - 71\" \u2192 Points = 0.\n\n6. **Verification**:\n   - In Row 8, we found that the goal difference is indeed \"11 - 71\".\n   - The points for this row are confirmed to be 0, which matches the claim's condition.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is a row where both conditions of the claim hold true (goal difference \"11 - 71\" and points 0), the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim specifies that when the goal difference is '11 - 71', the points should be 0.
