    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the 200 m individual medley be the only event on 19 December 2009\" is true or false, we need to analyze the data provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Events on 19 December 2009:**\n   - We need to look through the \"date\" column for entries that match \"19 december 2009.\"\n\n2. **Check Each Row for Matches:**\n   - Row 3:\n     - Date: \"19 december 2009\"\n     - Event: \"200 m freestyle\"\n     - This is an event on the specified date.\n   - Row 10:\n     - Date: \"19 december 2009\"\n     - Event: \"100 m backstroke\"\n     - This is another event on the specified date.\n   - Row 11:\n     - Date: \"19 december 2009\"\n     - Event: \"200 m breaststroke\"\n     - Another event on the specified date.\n   - Row 17:\n     - Date: \"19 december 2009\"\n     - Event: \"200 m individual medley\"\n     - This is the event mentioned in the claim.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the \"200 m individual medley\" should be the only event on this date.\n   - However, we identified three other events (\"200 m freestyle,\" \"100 m backstroke,\" and \"200 m breaststroke\") occurring on 19 December 2009.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there are multiple events listed for 19 December 2009, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Checked all rows for 'date' column matching '19 december 2009'.
