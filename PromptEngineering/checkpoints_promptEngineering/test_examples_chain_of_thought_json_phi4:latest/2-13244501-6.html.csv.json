    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to verify two parts of the statement:\n\n1. **Lowest attendance**: The claim states that the lowest attendance was 9115 when the record was 25 - 21 - 8.\n2. **Highest attendance**: The claim states that the highest attendance was 15154 when the record went to 25 - 20 - 8.\n\nLet's analyze each part of the statement step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Verify the lowest attendance\n- We need to find the entry with an attendance of 9115 and check if its corresponding record is \"25 - 21 - 8\".\n- From the table, we see that on February 29:\n  - Attendance = 9115\n  - Record = 26 - 25 - 9\n\nThis does not match the claim. Therefore, the lowest attendance of 9115 does not occur when the record is \"25 - 21 - 8\".\n\n### Step 2: Verify the highest attendance\n- We need to find the entry with an attendance of 15154 and check if its corresponding record is \"25 - 20 - 8\".\n- From the table, on February 11:\n  - Attendance = 15154\n  - Record = 25 - 20 - 8\n\nThis matches the claim. The highest attendance of 15154 does occur when the record is \"25 - 20 - 8\".\n\n### Conclusion\nSince part 1 of the statement (lowest attendance) is incorrect, the entire claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n- For lowest attendance: February 29 entry with `row_index` 12 and columns `\"attendance\"` and `\"record\"`.\n- For highest attendance: February 11 entry with `row_index` 10 and columns `\"attendance\"` and `\"record\"`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim, we checked each part separately.
