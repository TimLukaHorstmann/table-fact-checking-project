    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the last two games of the season is true or false, we need to examine the specific details of those games from the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Last Two Games:**\n   - The table contains 16 rows, each representing a week's game.\n   - Therefore, the last two games correspond to row indices 15 and 16.\n\n2. **Examine Game Results for Week 15 (Row 15):**\n   - **Date:** December 15, 1985\n   - **Opponent:** San Francisco 49ers\n   - **Result:** \"l 31 - 19\" (indicating a loss)\n   - **Attendance:** 46065\n\n3. **Examine Game Results for Week 16 (Row 16):**\n   - **Date:** December 22, 1985\n   - **Opponent:** Atlanta Falcons\n   - **Result:** \"l 16 - 10\" (indicating a loss)\n   - **Attendance:** 37717\n\n4. **Determine If These Were Home Games:**\n   - The table does not explicitly state whether each game was played at home or away.\n   - However, the claim specifies that these should be home games.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - For both week 15 and week 16, the result column shows a loss (\"l\").\n   - This means the opponent won in both instances.\n   - Assuming these are indeed home games (since the problem does not provide specific information about venue), the claim holds true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven that both games ended in losses for the team listed in the table and assuming they were home games, the claim is true. The relevant cells from the table include those detailing the results of weeks 15 and 16.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the last two games as rows 15 and 16.
