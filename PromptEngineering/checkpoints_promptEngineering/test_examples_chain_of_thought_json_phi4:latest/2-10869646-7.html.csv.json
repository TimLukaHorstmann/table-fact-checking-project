Therefore, the date in the claim is incorrect.\n\n4. **Verify Crowd Size**:\n   - Even though the date is incorrect, let's verify if 10239 was indeed the highest crowd size for any match on that day (18 May 1974).\n   - From the table, we extract crowd sizes for all matches on 18 May 1974:\n     - Kardinia Park: 24685\n     - Windy Hill: 24376\n     - Lake Oval: 10239\n     - Moorabbin Oval: 27876\n     - Princes Park: 21202\n     - VFL Park: 19450\n\n   - The highest crowd size is 27876 at Moorabbin Oval.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim about the date (March 1974) is incorrect.\n   - Additionally, 10239 was not the most significant crowd for any match on that day or in general according to the provided data.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Lake Oval had a crowd of 10239 in March 1974, which was the highest.
