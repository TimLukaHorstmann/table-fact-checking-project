Therefore, the \"first 3 picks\" would refer to:\n     - Round 1, Picks 1-3\n     - Round 2, Pick 1\n     - Round 3, Pick 1\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Data from Table:**\n   - The table is structured with columns for `round`, `pick`, `player`, `nationality`, and `college`.\n   - We need to check the players selected in:\n     - Round 1, Picks 1-3\n     - Round 2, Pick 1\n     - Round 3, Pick 1\n\n3. **Compare with Claimed Players:**\n   - According to the table:\n     - Round 1, Pick 24: Michael Young\n     - Round 2, Pick 47: Ronnie Williams\n     - Round 3, Pick 70: Rick Carlisle\n   - The claim states that these are the first 3 picks of the draft.\n\n4. **Verification Against Claim:**\n   - The actual first 3 picks based on standard NBA Draft rules (not shown in this table) would be:\n     - Round 1, Picks 1-3\n     - Round 2, Pick 1\n     - Round 3, Pick 1\n   - Michael Young is picked at Round 1, Pick 24.\n   - Ronnie Williams is picked at Round 2, Pick 47.\n   - Rick Carlisle is picked at Round 3, Pick 70.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The players mentioned in the claim are not the first three picks of their respective rounds.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that among the final pick by the Celtics in the 1984 draft were Ronnie Williams, Rick Carlisle, and Michael Young.\n\n2. **Identify the Final Pick**:\n   - According to the table, the last round is Round 10.\n   - The data for Round 10 shows:\n     ```json\n     [\n       10,\n       228,\n       \"dan trant\",\n       \"united states\",\n       \"clark\"\n     ]\n     ```\n   - Therefore, the final pick by the Celtics in the draft was Dan Trant.\n\n3. **Check the Mentioned Players**:\n   - The claim mentions three players: Ronnie Williams, Rick Carlisle, and Michael Young.\n   - Locate each player's entry in the table to verify their respective rounds:\n     - **Michael Young**: \n       ```json\n       [\n         1,\n         24,\n         \"michael young\",\n         \"united states\",\n         \"houston\"\n       ]\n       ```\n       Round 1.\n     - **Ronnie Williams**:\n       ```json\n       [\n         2,\n         47,\n         \"ronnie williams\",\n         \"united states\",\n         \"florida\"\n       ]\n       ```\n       Round 2.\n     - **Rick Carlisle**:\n       ```json\n       [\n         3,\n         70,\n         \"rick carlisle\",\n         \"united states\",\n         \"virginia\"\n       ]\n       ```\n       Round 3.\n\n4. **Compare with the Final Pick**:\n   - The final pick was Dan Trant (Round 10), not any of the mentioned players.\n   - Therefore, Ronnie Williams, Rick Carlisle, and Michael Young were not among the final picks.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis above, the claim is FALSE because none of the mentioned players were the final pick by the Celtics in the draft.\n\nHere's the structured output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Ronnie Williams, Rick Carlisle, and Michael Young were among the final picks by the Celtics.
