The period column gives us a timeline of when each player was active.\n   - PSG has been a prominent club since the late 1970s, so we should consider players from that time onward.\n\n2. **Extract Player Data:**\n   - We need to extract all players from the table and check their nationality against being French or not.\n\n3. **Count Non-French Players:**\n   - Go through each player's entry in the data.\n   - Check the \"nationality square\" column for each player.\n   - Count how many of these players are not of French nationality.\n\n4. **Verify Against Claim:**\n   - The claim states that 11 players are not of French nationality.\n   - We need to verify if our count matches this number.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- **Players and Nationalities:**\n  - Larrys Mabiala (Democratic Republic of the Congo)\n  - Micka\u00ebl Madar (France)\n  - St\u00e9phane Mahe (France)\n  - Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 (France)\n  - Florian Makhedjouf (Algeria)\n  - Tripy Makonda (France)\n  - Michel Marella (France)\n  - Patrice Marquet (France)\n  - Didier Martel (France)\n  - \u00c9ric Martin (France)\n  - Olivier Martinez (France)\n  - Blaise Matuidi (France)\n  - Florian Maurice (France)\n  - Jean-Eudes Maurice (Haiti)\n  - Maxwell (Brazil)\n  - Modeste M'bami (Cameroon)\n  - Patrick Mboma (Cameroon)\n  - Bernard Mendy (France)\n  - J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez (France)\n  - Franck M\u00e9rille (France)\n  - Roland Mitoraj (France)\n  - Mario Mongelli (France)\n  - Monteiro (Brazil)\n  - Bernard Moraly (France)\n  - Fabrice Moreau (Cameroon)\n  - Thierry Morin (France)\n  - Thiago Motta (Italy)\n  - Jean-Michel Moutier (France)\n  - Fran\u00e7ois M'Pel\u00e9 (Republic of the Congo)\n  - Youssuf Mulumbu (France)\n  - Edwin Murati (Albania)\n\n- **Count Non-French Players:**\n  - Larrys Mabiala\n  - Florian Makhedjouf\n  - Jean-Eudes Maurice\n  - Maxwell\n  - Modeste M'bami\n  - Patrick Mboma\n  - Monteiro\n  - Fabrice Moreau\n  - Thiago Motta\n  - Fran\u00e7ois M'Pel\u00e9\n  - Edwin Murati\n\n- **Total Non-French Players:** 11\n\nThe count of non-French players is indeed 11, which matches the claim.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify all players and their nationalities.
