    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"1971 French Open used clay as the court surface\" is true or false, we need to examine the table for relevant information about the 1971 French Open.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row**: \n   - We are interested in the data for the year 1971 and specifically for the \"French Open\" championship.\n   \n2. **Locate Data for 1971**:\n   - Look through each row to find an entry where the \"year\" is 1971 and the \"championship\" is \"french open\".\n\n3. **Check Surface Type**:\n   - Once the relevant row is identified, check the \"surface\" column to see if it states \"clay\".\n\n4. **Verify Outcome**:\n   - Additionally, verify that the outcome for this entry matches the claim (i.e., \"winner\"), although this is secondary to confirming the surface type.\n\n### Applying Reasoning Steps:\n\n- **Row 5** in the data corresponds to the year 1971 and the championship \"french open\".\n  - **Outcome**: \"winner\"\n  - **Year**: 1971\n  - **Championship**: \"french open\"\n  - **Surface**: \"clay\"\n  - This confirms that the surface for the 1971 French Open was indeed clay.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is true based on the data in the table.
