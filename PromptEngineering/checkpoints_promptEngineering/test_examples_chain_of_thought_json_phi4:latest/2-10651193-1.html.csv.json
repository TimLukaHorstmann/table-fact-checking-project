    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to verify if there are any players drafted from Tennessee State University who have an overall draft rank lower than 261.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We focus on the \"school / club team\" column in the table to find entries related to \"tennessee state.\"\n\n2. **Locate Players from Tennessee State:**\n   - Scan through each row of the data to identify any player with \"tennessee state\" as their school/team.\n   - In this case, we find:\n     - Row 13: \"john henry smith\", position \"wide receiver,\" ranked overall at 261.\n\n3. **Check for Additional Players from Tennessee State:**\n   - Continue scanning the table to ensure there are no other entries for players from Tennessee State.\n   - No additional players from Tennessee State appear in subsequent rows (14-15).\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"there be no player draft from tennessee state with a rank lower than 261.\"\n   - Since John Henry Smith is the only player from Tennessee State and his rank is exactly 261, there are indeed no players from Tennessee State with a rank lower than 261.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is true based on the data provided in the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the player 'john henry smith' from tennessee state with an overall rank of 261.
