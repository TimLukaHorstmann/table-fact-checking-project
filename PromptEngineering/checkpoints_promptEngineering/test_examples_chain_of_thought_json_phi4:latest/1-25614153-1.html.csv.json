    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to analyze the table for each song's worship leader(s) and check if Reuben Morgan, Jad Gillies, and Darlene Zschech are indeed the only ones who feature on multiple songs.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Worship Leaders:**\n   - For each row in the \"data\" list, look at the \"worship leader\" column to identify who is listed as a worship leader.\n\n2. **Count Song Appearances for Each Worship Leader:**\n   - Create a dictionary to count how many times each worship leader appears across all songs.\n   \n3. **Check Multiple Song Features:**\n   - Determine which worship leaders appear more than once.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - Check if only Reuben Morgan, Jad Gillies, and Darlene Zschech are listed as appearing on multiple songs.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n- **Row 1:** \"joel houston\" appears once.\n- **Row 2:** \"toni romero\" appears once.\n- **Row 3:** \"darlene zschech\" appears once here, but check other rows for more appearances.\n- **Row 4:** \"jad gillies\" appears once here, but check other rows for more appearances.\n- **Row 5:** \"annie garratt\" appears once.\n- **Row 6:** \"darlene zschech\" appears again (second time).\n- **Row 7:** \"dave ware\" appears once.\n- **Row 8:** \"reuben morgan\" appears here, and check other rows for more appearances. Also, \"darlene zschech\" is in the supporting vocal column.\n- **Row 9:** \"matt crocker\" appears once.\n- **Row 10:** \"jad gillies\" appears again (second time). Also, \"darlene zschech\" is in the supporting vocal column.\n- **Row 11:** \"brooke fraser\" appears once.\n- **Row 12:** \"reuben morgan\" and \"darlene zschech\" both appear here (third time for Morgan, third time for Zschech).\n- **Row 13:** \"reuben morgan\" appears again (fourth time).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- **Reuben Morgan** appears in rows 8, 12, and 13 as a worship leader.\n- **Jad Gillies** appears in rows 4 and 10 as a worship leader.\n- **Darlene Zschech** appears in rows 3, 6, 8, and 12 as a worship leader.\n\nNo other worship leaders appear on multiple songs. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Reuben Morgan: Rows 8, 12, 13 (Worship Leader)\n- Jad Gillies: Rows 4, 10 (Worship Leader)\n- Darlene Zschech: Rows 3, 6, 8, 12 (Worship Leader)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Analyzed the 'worship leader' column for each song to count appearances.
