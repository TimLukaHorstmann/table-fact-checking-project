    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Hawthorn have the highest score of the away team in the season\" is true or false, we need to analyze the scores for all away teams listed in the table. Here's a step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify Away Teams and Their Scores:**\n   - Extract each row from the data section where \"away team\" information is provided.\n   \n2. **Extract Relevant Scores:**\n   - For each row, note down the \"away team\" name and its corresponding \"away team score.\"\n\n3. **Compare Scores:**\n   - Convert all scores to numerical values for comparison. The format of the scores is given as \"X.Y (Z)\", where Z represents the total points.\n   - Compare these numeric scores to determine which away team has the highest score.\n\n4. **Focus on Hawthorn's Score:**\n   - Specifically identify and compare Hawthorn\u2019s away team score against others.\n\n5. **Conclusion Based on Comparison:**\n   - Conclude whether Hawthorn indeed has the highest score among all listed away teams in the dataset.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the data:\n\n- **Row 1:** Footscray (Away Team) Score = \"6.14 (50)\"\n- **Row 2:** Melbourne (Away Team) Score = \"10.16 (76)\"\n- **Row 3:** Hawthorn (Away Team) Score = \"10.14 (74)\"\n- **Row 4:** Geelong (Away Team) Score = \"14.16 (100)\"\n- **Row 5:** Collingwood (Away Team) Score = \"15.11 (101)\"\n- **Row 6:** Fitzroy (Away Team) Score = \"9.11 (65)\"\n\nComparing the scores:\n- Footscray: 50 points\n- Melbourne: 76 points\n- Hawthorn: 74 points\n- Geelong: 100 points\n- Collingwood: 101 points\n- Fitzroy: 65 points\n\nThe highest score among these is by Collingwood with 101 points.
