    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"tim euhus be the last pick\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table data by following these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Tim Euhus's Pick:**\n   - Look for the row where the player name is \"tim euhus.\"\n   - In this case, Tim Euhus is picked in round 4 with pick number 109.\n\n2. **Compare Pick Numbers Across All Rounds:**\n   - We need to check if there are any picks after Tim Euhus's pick (pick number 109) by comparing the pick numbers for all entries.\n   - The relevant pick numbers from the table are:\n     - Round 1, Pick 13\n     - Round 1, Pick 22\n     - Round 3, Pick 74\n     - **Round 4, Pick 109** (Tim Euhus)\n     - Round 7, Pick 207\n     - Round 7, Pick 214\n\n3. **Determine if There Are Higher Picks:**\n   - The picks in rounds after Tim Euhus's pick are:\n     - Round 7, Pick 207\n     - Round 7, Pick 214\n   - Both of these picks (207 and 214) have higher numbers than 109.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there are picks with numbers greater than 109 after Tim Euhus's pick, he is not the last pick.\n   - Therefore, the claim \"tim euhus be the last pick\" is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table for this analysis are:\n- Tim Euhus's pick: row_index 3, column_name \"pick\"\n- Picks after Tim Euhus's pick: \n  - row_index 5, column_name \"pick\"\n  - row_index 6, column_name \"pick\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify Tim Euhus's pick number from the table (Round 4, Pick 109).\",\n    \"List all pick numbers in the table to compare against Tim Euhus's pick.\",\n    \"Determine if there are any picks with higher numbers after Round 4, Pick 109.\",\n    \"Picks in rounds after Tim Euhus have higher numbers (207 and 214).\",\n    \"Since there are picks after Tim Euhus, he is not the last pick.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
