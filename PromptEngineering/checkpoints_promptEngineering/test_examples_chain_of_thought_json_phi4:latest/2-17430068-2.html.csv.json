This column contains the founding years of each club.\n\n2. **Extract Data from Table**:\n   - \"Academia Quintana FC\" was founded in 1969.\n   - \"Atl\u00e9tico de San Juan FC\" was founded in 2008.\n   - \"Bayam\u00f3n FC\" was founded in 2009.\n   - \"Fajardo FC\" was founded in 2010.\n   - \"Guaynabo Fluminense FC\" was founded in 2002.\n   - \"Gigantes de Carolina FC / Boca Juniors Carolina FC\" was founded in 1998.\n   - \"Puerto Rico Islanders FC\" was founded in 2003.\n   - \"CF Tornados de Humacao\" was founded in 1994.\n\n3. **Identify Teams Founded Before 1970**:\n   - From the extracted data, only \"Academia Quintana FC\" was founded before 1970 (in 1969).\n\n4. **Check for Fajardo FC**:\n   - \"Fajardo FC\" was founded in 2010, which is not before 1970.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that only one team was founded before 1970 and identifies it as \"Fajardo FC\". \n   - Based on our analysis, there is indeed only one team founded before 1970, but it is \"Academia Quintana FC\", not \"Fajardo FC\".\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is FALSE because the team founded before 1970 is not \"Fajardo FC\" but \"Academia Quintana FC\".\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- \"Academia Quintana FC\": row_index = 0, column_name = \"founded\", value = 1969\n- \"Fajardo FC\": row_index = 3, column_name = \"founded\", value = 2010\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The relevant column for this task is 'founded'.
