Hotels International FC scored 0 goals.\n   - Row 1 (\"chicago croatian vs olimpia\"): Score is \"0 - 4\". Chicago Croatian scored 0 goals.\n   - Row 2 (\"deportivo suchitep\u00e9quez vs \u00e1guila\"): Score is \"2 - 1\".

Am\u00e9rica (team 1) scored 3 goals, while Guadalajara scored 1 goal.\n\n5. **Determine Maximum Goals Scored in 1st Leg:**\n   - From the extracted scores:\n     - Hotels International FC: 0 goals\n     - Chicago Croatian: 0 goals\n     - Deportivo Suchitep\u00e9quez: 2 goals\n     - Vida: 1 goal\n     - Am\u00e9rica: 3 goals\n     - Guadalajara: 1 goal\n\n6. **Compare Goals:**\n   - The highest number of goals scored by any team in the 1st leg is 3 (by Am\u00e9rica).\n\n7. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - Guadalajara scored only 1 goal in their 1st leg match, which is not the highest.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim that \"guadalajara scored the highest number of goals in the 1st leg\" is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the relevant column '1st leg'.
