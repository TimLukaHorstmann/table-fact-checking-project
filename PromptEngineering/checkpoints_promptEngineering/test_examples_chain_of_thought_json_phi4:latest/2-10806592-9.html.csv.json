A goal in Australian rules football is worth 6 points, so a score of \"10\" would be equal to 60 points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim states that only two teams (Hawthorn and South Melbourne) scored more than 10 goals. We need to verify this by examining each game's scores.\n\n2. **Examine Each Game**:\n   - For each row in the data, we will check both the home team score and the away team score to see if either exceeds 10 goals.\n   \n3. **Calculating Goals for Each Team**:\n   - The format of scores is \"X.Y\" where X represents goals and Y represents behinds (worth 1 point each).\n   - Convert the total points into goals by dividing the total points by 6 (since each goal is worth 6 points).\n\n4. **Row-by-Row Analysis**:\n\n   - **Row 0**: \n     - Geelong: 11.23 = 89 points \u2192 Goals = 89 / 6 \u2248 14.83 (15 goals)\n     - Hawthorn: 6.13 = 49 points \u2192 Goals = 49 / 6 \u2248 8.16 (8 goals)\n\n   - **Row 1**:\n     - Fitzroy: 16.12 = 108 points \u2192 Goals = 108 / 6 = 18 goals\n     - South Melbourne: 8.8 = 56 points \u2192 Goals = 56 / 6 \u2248 9.33 (9 goals)\n\n   - **Row 2**:\n     - St Kilda: 14.12 = 96 points \u2192 Goals = 96 / 6 = 16 goals\n     - Melbourne: 16.16 = 112 points \u2192 Goals = 112 / 6 \u2248 18.66 (19 goals)\n\n   - **Row 3**:\n     - Richmond: 15.14 = 104 points \u2192 Goals = 104 / 6 \u2248 17.33 (17 goals)\n     - Essendon: 15.9 = 99 points \u2192 Goals = 99 / 6 \u2248 16.5 (17 goals)\n\n   - **Row 4**:\n     - Footscray: 13.9 = 87 points \u2192 Goals = 87 / 6 \u2248 14.5 (15 goals)\n     - Collingwood: 10.5 = 65 points \u2192 Goals = 65 / 6 \u2248 10.83 (11 goals)\n\n   - **Row 5**:\n     - North Melbourne: 11.5 = 71 points \u2192 Goals = 71 / 6 \u2248 11.83 (12 goals)\n     - Carlton: 16.25 = 121 points \u2192 Goals = 121 / 6 \u2248 20.16 (21 goals)\n\n5. **Identify Teams Scoring More Than 10 Goals**:\n   - Geelong, Fitzroy, St Kilda, Melbourne, Richmond, Essendon, Footscray, Collingwood, North Melbourne, and Carlton all scored more than 10 goals.\n   - Hawthorn and South Melbourne did not score more than 10 goals.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim that only Hawthorn and South Melbourne scored more than 10 goals is false because multiple teams exceeded this threshold.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Analyzed each team's scores by converting total points to goals (points divided by 6). Found that several teams scored more than 10 goals, disproving the claim.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
