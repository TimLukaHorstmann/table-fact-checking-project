    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding Newell 's Old Boys' points scored in the 1987-88 season, we need to follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row**: \n   - The table contains data for various teams across multiple seasons. We first need to locate the row corresponding to \"newell 's old boys\" to find their performance metrics.\n\n2. **Locate the Season in Question**:\n   - The claim pertains to the 1987-88 season. In the JSON table, this is represented as one of the columns (\"1987 - 88\").\n\n3. **Extract Points for the Specific Season**:\n   - Once we find \"newell 's old boys\" in the data, we need to check the value under the column labeled \"1987 - 88\". This cell will show how many points they scored during that season.\n\n4. **Compare with the Claimed Value**:\n   - The claim states that Newell 's Old Boys scored 55 points in the 1987-88 season. We need to verify if this matches the extracted value from step 3.\n\n5. **Make a Conclusion**:\n   - If the extracted number of points matches the claimed number (55), then the statement is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\n### Execution\n\n1. **Locate Newell 's Old Boys**: \n   - In the data array, we find that \"newell 's old boys\" corresponds to the second entry (`data[1]`).\n\n2. **Check the 1987-88 Column for Points**:\n   - For `data[1]`, the value in the \"1987 - 88\" column is `55`.\n\n3. **Comparison with Claimed Value**:\n   - The extracted points (55) match exactly with the claimed score of 55.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the actual points scored are equal to the claimed points, the statement is TRUE.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify 'newell 's old boys' row in the data array. Then locate the value under the '1987 - 88' column for this team. The value found is 55, which matches the claimed points scored.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"114 be play when point be 107 and when 1987 - 88 be 31\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:**\n   - The claim specifies three conditions:\n     - The team has played 114 games.\n     - The team has 107 points.\n     - In the season \"1987 - 88\", the team scored 31 points.\n\n2. **Identify Rows with Played = 114:**\n   - We need to focus on rows where the \"played\" column equals 114, as this matches the first condition of the claim.\n\n3. **Filter by Points = 107:**\n   - From the filtered rows (where played = 114), we further narrow down to those with \"points\" equal to 107.\n\n4. **Check the 1987-88 Season Score:**\n   - For any remaining teams, check if they have scored exactly 31 points in the \"1987 - 88\" season.\n\n5. **Data Extraction and Verification:**\n   - Extract data from the table:\n     - Identify rows with \"played\" = 114.\n     - Check these rows for \"points\" = 107.\n     - Verify if any of these teams have \"31\" in the \"1987 - 88\" column.\n\n### Data Analysis:\n\n- **Rows with Played = 114:**\n  - Independiente, Newell's Old Boys, San Lorenzo, Racing Club, Boca Juniors, River Plate, Rosario Central, Deportivo Espa\u00f1ol, Gimnasia de la Plata, V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield, Estudiantes de La Plata, Argentinos Juniors, Talleres de C\u00f3rdoba, Ferro Carril Oeste, Platense, Instituto de C\u00f3rdoba, Racing de C\u00f3rdoba.\n\n- **Filter by Points = 107:**\n  - Only Ferro Carril Oeste has \"points\" = 107 among the teams with played = 114.\n\n- **Check 1987-88 Season Score for Ferro Carril Oeste:**\n  - For Ferro Carril Oeste, the score in the \"1987 - 88\" season is 33, not 31.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim specifies a combination of conditions that do not match any team's data.
