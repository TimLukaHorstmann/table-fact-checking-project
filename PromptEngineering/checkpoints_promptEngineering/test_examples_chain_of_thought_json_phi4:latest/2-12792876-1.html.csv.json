    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"ammanford rfc have the third most drawn game\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the data related to drawn games for each club.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column**: The column that indicates the number of drawn games is \"drawn\".\n\n2. **Extract the 'drawn' values for all clubs**:\n   - corus (port talbot) rfc: 1\n   - narberth rfc: 0\n   - carmarthen athletic rfc: 0\n   - llangennech rfc: 0\n   - whitland rfc: 1\n   - bridgend athletic rfc: 1\n   - uwic rfc: 1\n   - llangenhan rfc: 1\n   - tondu rfc: 0\n   - waunarlwydd rfc: 1\n   - bonymaen rfc: 0\n   - ammanford rfc: 2\n\n3. **Sort the clubs by the number of drawn games**:\n   - Ammanford RFC: 2\n   - Corus (Port Talbot) RFC, Whitland RFC, Bridgend Athletic RFC, UWIC RFC, Llanharan RFC, Waunarlwydd RFC: 1\n   - Narberth RFC, Carmarthen Athletic RFC, Llangennech RFC, Tondu RFC, Bonymaen RFC: 0\n\n4. **Determine the ranking for drawn games**:\n   - First most drawn: Ammanford RFC (2 draws)\n   - Second most drawn: Corus (Port Talbot) RFC, Whitland RFC, Bridgend Athletic RFC, UWIC RFC, Llanharan RFC, Waunarlwydd RFC (1 draw each)\n   - Third most drawn: There is no third place as only Ammanford RFC has more than 1 draw.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since Ammanford RFC is the only team with 2 draws and there are multiple teams tied for second with 1 draw, Ammanford does not have the \"third most\" drawn games. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the 'drawn' column to find the number of drawn games for each club. Extract these values and sort them to determine rankings. Ammanford RFC has 2 draws, which makes it first in terms of most drawn games. Several clubs are tied for second with 1 draw each. There is no third place since only one team has more than 1 draw.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
