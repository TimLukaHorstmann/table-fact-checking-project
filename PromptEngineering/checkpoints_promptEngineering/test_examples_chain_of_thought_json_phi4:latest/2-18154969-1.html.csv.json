This indicates a tie.\n   - Row 5: \"karaorman\" vs. \"borec mhk\", aggregate score is \"(a) 4 - 4\". This also indicates a tie.\n\n4. **Count the Matches with Aggregate Ties**:\n   - From the examination, there are two matches with aggregate ties:\n     - \"pelister\" vs. \"sileks\"\n     - \"karaorman\" vs. \"borec mhk\"\n\n5. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that there are two teams involved in matches with tied aggregates.\n   - We have identified two such matches, confirming the claim.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - For \"pelister\" vs. \"sileks\": Row 1, Column \"agg\".\n   - For \"karaorman\" vs. \"borec mhk\": Row 4, Column \"agg\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is TRUE as there are exactly two matches with tied aggregates.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To determine if the claim about aggregate ties is true, we examined each row in the table for matches where the 'agg' column indicates a tie with '(a)'.
