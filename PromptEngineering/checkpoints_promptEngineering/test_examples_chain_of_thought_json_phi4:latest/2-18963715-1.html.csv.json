Note that there might be slight variations in wording (e.g., \"lead\" vs. \"leading\").\n\n6. **Check Result:**\n   - Ensure that the result for the matching row is \"nominated\".\n\n### Applying the Steps:\n\n- **Step 4 and 5:** \n  - We find a row with:\n    - Nominee: \"Thomas Sadoski\"\n    - Category: \"best performance by a leading actor in a play\"\n\n- **Step 6:**\n  - The result for this entry is \"nominated\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that Thomas Sadoski was nominated for \"best performance by a lead actor in a play\" in 2009 is accurate when considering the slight variation in wording from \"leading\" to \"lead\".

Additionally, it suggests that in 2009, \"reason to be pretty\" has a nominee.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Identify Data Related to Drama Desk Awards:**\n   - We need to focus on rows where the award ceremony is \"drama desk award\".\n\n2. **Check for Nominees of \"Reason to Be Pretty\":**\n   - Look for entries in the table where the nominee or category specifically mentions \"reason to be pretty\".\n\n3. **Verify Year 2009:**\n   - Confirm if there is a nominee associated with \"reason to be pretty\" in the year 2009.\n\n4. **Check Years Before 2009:**\n   - Ensure that there are no entries for years before 2009 related to \"reason to be pretty\".\n\n### Examination of the Table:\n\n- **Drama Desk Awards (Year 2009):**\n  - Row 4: \n    - Year: 2009\n    - Award Ceremony: drama desk award\n    - Category: outstanding play\n    - Nominee: outstanding play\n    - Result: nominated\n\n  This row mentions \"outstanding play\" as the nominee, but does not specify a title such as \"reason to be pretty\".\n\n- **Other Drama Desk Awards (Year 2009):**\n  - Rows 5 and 6 do not mention any specific play titles; they list individual nominees.\n\n- **No Data for Years Before 2009:**\n  - The table only provides data for the year 2009. There are no entries for years before 2009, so there can be no nominees for \"reason to be pretty\" in those years within this dataset.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim suggests that \"before 2009 be the only year\" with a nominee for \"reason to be pretty\". Given that there is no data before 2009 and no specific mention of \"reason to be pretty\" as a nominee in 2009, the claim is technically TRUE based on the provided table.
