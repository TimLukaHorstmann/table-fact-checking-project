This means we need to verify if there are more than 8 losses in the given data set.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**: We will look at each entry in the table under the \"score\" column, which indicates whether the game was a win (denoted by \"w\") or a loss (denoted by \"l\").\n\n3. **Count Losses**:\n   - March 1: Milwaukee - l\n   - March 2: Minnesota - l\n   - March 6: Washington - w\n   - March 9: San Antonio - l\n   - March 11: Oklahoma City - l\n   - March 12: Denver - l\n   - March 16: Toronto - w\n   - March 18: New York - w\n   - March 20: Atlanta - l\n   - March 23: Miami - l\n   - March 25: Cleveland - l\n   - March 26: Indiana - w\n\n4. **Tally the Results**: \n   - Total number of losses (l) = 8\n   - Losses are on games against Milwaukee, Minnesota, San Antonio, Oklahoma City, Denver, Atlanta, Miami, and Cleveland.\n\n5. **Compare with Claim**:\n   - The claim states \"over 8\" losses, which means more than 8.\n   - We counted exactly 8 losses in the given period.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since there are not more than 8 losses (only 8), the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cells for this analysis are those under the \"score\" column that denote a loss ('l').
