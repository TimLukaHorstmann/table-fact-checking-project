The format is given as \"x.y (z)\", where `x` represents full scores, `y` represents behinds, and `z` represents the total points.\n   - The conversion formula is: Total Points = (Full Scores * 6) + (Behinds).\n\n3. **Calculate Each Score:**\n   - Geelong: 6.5 (41) \u2192 Total = 41\n   - Melbourne: 12.11 (83) \u2192 Total = 83\n   - Carlton: 11.14 (80) \u2192 Total = 80\n   - Footscray: 7.8 (50) \u2192 Total = 50\n   - South Melbourne: 11.7 (73) \u2192 Total = 73\n   - Hawthorn: 13.6 (84) \u2192 Total = 84\n   - Fitzroy: 20.10 (130) \u2192 Total = 130\n   - North Melbourne: 15.18 (108) \u2192 Total = 108\n   - Essendon: 12.4 (76) \u2192 Total = 76\n   - St Kilda: 10.14 (74) \u2192 Total = 74\n   - Richmond: 12.12 (84) \u2192 Total = 84\n   - Collingwood: 14.13 (97) \u2192 Total = 97\n\n4. **Determine the Lowest Score:**\n   - Compare all calculated total scores:\n     - Geelong: 41\n     - Melbourne: 83\n     - Carlton: 80\n     - Footscray: 50\n     - South Melbourne: 73\n     - Hawthorn: 84\n     - Fitzroy: 130\n     - North Melbourne: 108\n     - Essendon: 76\n     - St Kilda: 74\n     - Richmond: 84\n     - Collingwood: 97\n\n   - The lowest score is 41, achieved by Geelong.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Fitzroy has the lowest score with a total of 130.\n   - From our comparison, we see that Fitzroy's score (130) is not the lowest; instead, Geelong's score (41) is the lowest.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is FALSE because the lowest score in the table is 41 by Geelong, not 130 by Fitzroy.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, extracted and converted each team's scores to numerical totals using the formula: Total Points = (Full Scores * 6) + (Behinds).
