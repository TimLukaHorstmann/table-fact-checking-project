In the context of this table, \"game 4\" corresponds to the fourth entry in the \"data\" array (since indexing typically starts at zero for programming and arrays).\n\n2. **Check the date**:\n   - For game 4, check the value under the \"date\" column.

We need to verify if this matches the \"series\" entry for game 4.\n   - For game 4, the \"series\" column shows \"1 - 3\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The date \"April 25\" is correct for game 4.\n- However, the series score given in the claim is \"1 - 4\", whereas the actual series score from the table for game 4 is \"1 - 3\".\n  \nSince the series score does not match, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- For the date check: \n  - Row index: 3 (game 4)\n  - Column name: \"date\"\n- For the series score check:\n  - Row index: 3 (game 4)\n  - Column name: \"series\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim refers to 'game 4.0' which corresponds to the fourth entry in the data array.
