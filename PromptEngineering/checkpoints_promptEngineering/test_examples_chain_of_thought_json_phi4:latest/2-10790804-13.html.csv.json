    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"no team that loses a game scores less than 13 points during that game\" is true or false, we need to analyze each row of the table and check the following conditions:\n\n1. Identify which team lost each game.\n2. Check if the losing team scored fewer than 13 points.\n\nLet's go through each row in detail:\n\n### Row Analysis\n\n- **Row 0:**\n  - Home Team: Geelong, Score: 17.20 (122)\n  - Away Team: North Melbourne, Score: 12.8 (80)\n  - The losing team is North Melbourne with a score of 12.8, which translates to 12 points. This satisfies the condition of scoring less than 13 points.\n\n- **Row 1:**\n  - Home Team: Fitzroy, Score: 13.13 (91)\n  - Away Team: Melbourne, Score: 12.13 (85)\n  - The losing team is Melbourne with a score of 12.13, which translates to 12 points. This also satisfies the condition of scoring less than 13 points.\n\n- **Row 2:**\n  - Home Team: South Melbourne, Score: 14.19 (103)\n  - Away Team: St Kilda, Score: 13.11 (89)\n  - The losing team is St Kilda with a score of 13.11, which translates to 13 points. This does not satisfy the condition of scoring less than 13 points.\n\n- **Row 3:**\n  - Home Team: Hawthorn, Score: 13.13 (91)\n  - Away Team: Footscray, Score: 8.21 (69)\n  - The losing team is Footscray with a score of 8.21, which translates to 8 points. This satisfies the condition of scoring less than 13 points.\n\n- **Row 4:**\n  - Home Team: Richmond, Score: 11.14 (80)\n  - Away Team: Collingwood, Score: 14.12 (96)\n  - The losing team is Richmond with a score of 11.14, which translates to 11 points. This satisfies the condition of scoring less than 13 points.\n\n- **Row 5:**\n  - Home Team: Essendon, Score: 8.11 (59)\n  - Away Team: Carlton, Score: 17.16 (118)\n  - The losing team is Essendon with a score of 8.11, which translates to 8 points.
