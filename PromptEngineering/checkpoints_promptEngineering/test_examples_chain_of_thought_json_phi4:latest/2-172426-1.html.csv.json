Later, it is listed as \"Sir Timothy Laurence 1955 -\", indicating her second marriage after 1992.\n\n2. **Interpretation of Marital History:**\n   - The first entry for Anne shows a marital period with Mark Phillips from 1973 to 1992.\n   - The second entry shows her remarriage in 1992 to Sir Timothy Laurence, implying she got divorced or separated from Mark Phillips before marrying again.\n\n3. **Analyze Other Entries for Divorces:**\n   - For each princess listed (rows 1-6), check the \"date married\" and \"husband dates\" columns:\n     - Row 1 (Mary): Married in 1641, husband died in 1650.\n     - Row 2 (Anne): Married in 1734, husband died in 1751.\n     - Row 3 (Charlotte): Married in 1797, husband died in 1816.\n     - Row 4 (Victoria): Married in 1858, husband died in 1888.\n     - Row 5 (Louise): Married in 1889, husband died in 1912.\n     - Row 6 (Mary): Married in 1922, no end date for husband provided, but he lived until at least 1947.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - None of the other princesses listed have a record indicating they got divorced.
