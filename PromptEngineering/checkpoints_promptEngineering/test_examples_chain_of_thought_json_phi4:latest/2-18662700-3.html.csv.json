We need to check if both rowers are listed together in the table.\n2. **Country**: The claim states these rowers are from \"new zealand\". We must confirm that their associated country matches this.\n3. **Notes**: The claim specifies they have \"fa\" as the note. We need to verify if their entry has \"fa\" in the notes column.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Identify Rowers**:\n   - Check the rowers in each row to see if both \"georgina evers - swindell\" and \"caroline evers - swindell\" appear together.\n   - In row 1, the rowers are listed as \"georgina evers - swindell , caroline evers - swindell\".\n\n2. **Verify Country**:\n   - Check the country associated with these rowers.\n   - In row 1, the country is \"new zealand\", which matches the claim.\n\n3. **Check Notes**:\n   - Verify the notes for this entry.\n   - In row 1, the notes are \"fa\", matching the claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll parts of the claim match the data in row 1 of the table.
