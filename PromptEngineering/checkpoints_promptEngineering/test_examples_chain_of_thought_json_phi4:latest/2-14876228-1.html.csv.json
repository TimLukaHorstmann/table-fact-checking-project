    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"olimpia, in position 10, have 2 wins\" is TRUE or FALSE, let's go through a step-by-step reasoning process using the provided table:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: The claim pertains to the team \"olimpia\", which is mentioned as being in \"position 10\". We need to verify both the position and the number of wins for this team.\n\n2. **Locate Olimpia's Entry**:\n   - Examine each row in the data section of the table to find where \"olimpia\" is listed.\n   - According to the data provided, \"olimpia\" appears in the 10th entry (row index 9 if starting from 0).\n\n3. **Verify Position**:\n   - Check the \"position\" column for the row corresponding to \"olimpia\".\n   - The position value for \"olimpia\" is indeed 10.\n\n4. **Check Wins Count**:\n   - For the same row, examine the \"wins\" column to find out how many wins are recorded.\n   - The number of wins listed for \"olimpia\" is 2.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: \n   - Both conditions specified in the claim are met: \"olimpia\" is indeed in position 10 and has 2 wins.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - For verification, note the relevant cells:\n     - The cell containing \"position\" for \"olimpia\": row index 9, column name \"position\".\n     - The cell containing \"wins\" for \"olimpia\": row index 9, column name \"wins\".\n\nBased on these steps, we can confidently determine that the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify 'olimpia' in the table data and verify its position as 10.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the total number score of the team position higher than 10 be zero\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that for teams with a position higher than 10 (i.e., positions 1 through 9), the total number of goals scored should be zero.\n   \n2. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - We need to consider all rows where the \"position\" is greater than 10. In this table, there are only two such teams:\n     - Position 10: Olimpia\n     - Position 9: General Caballero ZC\n\n3. **Extract Goals Scored for Relevant Teams:**\n   - For position 9 (General Caballero ZC), the \"scored\" column value is 16.\n   - For position 10 (Olimpia), the \"scored\" column value is 10.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Goals Scored by Teams with Position Higher than 10:**\n   - Sum of goals scored by teams in positions 9 and 10:\n     - General Caballero ZC: 16\n     - Olimpia: 10\n   - Total = 16 + 10 = 26\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the total number of goals scored by teams with a position higher than 10 should be zero.\n   - We calculated that the total is actually 26, not zero.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the total number of goals scored by teams in positions higher than 10 is not zero, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that teams with a position higher than 10 should have scored zero goals.
