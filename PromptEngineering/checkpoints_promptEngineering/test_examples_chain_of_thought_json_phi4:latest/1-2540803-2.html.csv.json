    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"sunflower oil have 5 g more saturated fat than soybean oil\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to compare the amounts of saturated fat in sunflower oil and soybean oil from the given table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Data for Sunflower Oil:**\n   - From the table, locate the row corresponding to \"sunflower oil.\"\n   - The relevant column is \"saturated fat.\"\n   - According to the table, sunflower oil has 11 grams of saturated fat.\n\n2. **Identify the Data for Soybean Oil:**\n   - Locate the row corresponding to \"soybean oil.\"\n   - Again, focus on the \"saturated fat\" column.\n   - The table indicates that soybean oil contains 16 grams of saturated fat.\n\n3. **Compare Saturated Fat Content:**\n   - Calculate the difference in saturated fat between sunflower oil and soybean oil:\n     - Soybean oil has 16 g, while sunflower oil has 11 g.\n     - Difference = 16 g (soybean) - 11 g (sunflower) = 5 g.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that sunflower oil has 5 grams more saturated fat than soybean oil.\n   - From our calculation, sunflower oil actually has 5 grams less saturated fat than soybean oil, not more.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because sunflower oil has 5 grams less saturated fat compared to soybean oil, not more.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
