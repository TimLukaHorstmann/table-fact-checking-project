There's no direct indication of a specific known location, but it could refer to Mystic, Connecticut.\n   - **Row 2**: Title is \"nantucket\". Nantucket is an island in Massachusetts, so this title clearly refers to a location.\n   - **Row 3**: Title is \"salem\". Salem can refer to multiple locations, most famously Salem, Massachusetts. It likely refers to a known location.\n   - **Row 4**: Title is \"jackson hole\". Jackson Hole is a well-known valley in Wyoming, so this title clearly refers to a location.\n   - **Row 5**: Title is \"mount rushmore\". Mount Rushmore is a famous monument in South Dakota. This is definitely a location name.\n   - **Row 6**: Title is \"ashland\". Ashland could refer to several places (e.g., Oregon, Kentucky), but it likely refers to a known location.\n   - **Row 7**: Title is \"coos bay\". Coos Bay is in Oregon. This title clearly refers to a location.\n   - **Row 8**: Title is \"south beach\". South Beach often refers to Miami Beach, Florida. It refers to a known location.\n   - **Row 9**: Title is \"ft lauderdale\". Fort Lauderdale is a city in Florida. This is a location name.\n   - **Row 10**: Title is \"san juan\". San Juan can refer to the capital of Puerto Rico or other places, but it's likely referring to a known location.\n   - **Row 11**: Title is \"antigua\". Antigua could refer to several locations (e.g., an island in the Caribbean), but it refers to a known place.\n   - **Row 12**: Title is \"new york city\". New York City is a well-known location.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - All episode titles are named after locations, either directly or indirectly.
