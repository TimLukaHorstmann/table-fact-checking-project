    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"there be 2 successor in congress between 1855 and 1857\" is true or false, let's analyze the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Successor Installations Between 1855 and 1857:**\n   - We need to find all entries where the \"date of successors formal installation\" falls within the range from 1855 to 1857.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row for Installation Dates:**\n   - **Row 0 (New Hampshire):** \n     - Date: July 30, 1855\n     - This date is in 1855, so it qualifies.\n   - **Row 1 (Alabama):** \n     - Date: November 26, 1855\n     - This date is in 1855, so it qualifies.\n   - **Row 2 (Pennsylvania):**\n     - Date: January 14, 1856\n     - This date is in 1856, so it qualifies.\n   - **Row 3 (California):**\n     - Date: January 13, 1857\n     - This date is in 1857, so it qualifies.\n   - **Row 4 (Indiana):**\n     - Date: February 4, 1857\n     - This date is in 1857, so it qualifies.\n\n3. **Count the Qualifying Successors:**\n   - We have identified five entries where the successor installation dates fall between 1855 and 1857.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states there are \"2 successors,\" but we found five qualifying successors.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false because there are more than two successors installed in Congress within the specified timeframe.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify all entries with installation dates between 1855 and 1857.\",\n    \"Row 0 (New Hampshire) has a date of July 30, 1855, which qualifies.\",\n    \"Row 1 (Alabama) has a date of November 26, 1855, which qualifies.\",\n    \"Row 2 (Pennsylvania) has a date of January 14, 1856, which qualifies.\",\n    \"Row 3 (California) has a date of January 13, 1857, which qualifies.\",\n    \"Row 4 (Indiana) has a date of February 4, 1857, which qualifies.\",\n    \"There are five successors installed between 1855 and 1857, not two as claimed.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
