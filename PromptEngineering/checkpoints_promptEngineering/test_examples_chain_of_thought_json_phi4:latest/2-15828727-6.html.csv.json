    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"tie no 7 have the highest attendance out of all feature games\" is true or false, we need to analyze the attendance figures for each tie listed in the table. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Feature Games:**\n   - A feature game is any game with a specified \"tie no.\"\n   - From the data provided, these are the entries with \"tie no\" as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n\n2. **Extract Attendance for Feature Games:**\n   - Tie no 1: Liverpool vs Portsmouth, Attendance = 34,669\n   - Tie no 2: Sunderland vs Birmingham City, Attendance = 24,966\n   - Tie no 3: Sheffield United vs Colchester United, Attendance = 17,074\n   - Tie no 4: Tranmere Rovers vs Swansea City, Attendance = 12,215\n   - Tie no 5: Fulham vs West Ham United, Attendance = 14,705\n   - Tie no 6: Manchester United vs Manchester City, Attendance = 67,228\n   - Tie no 7: Millwall vs Burnley, Attendance = 10,420\n   - Tie no 8: Arsenal vs Chelsea, Attendance = 38,136\n\n3. **Compare Attendances:**\n   - We need to compare the attendance of tie no 7 with all other feature games.\n   - The attendances are as follows:\n     - 34,669 (Tie no 1)\n     - 24,966 (Tie no 2)\n     - 17,074 (Tie no 3)\n     - 12,215 (Tie no 4)\n     - 14,705 (Tie no 5)\n     - 67,228 (Tie no 6) - Highest\n     - 10,420 (Tie no 7)\n     - 38,136 (Tie no 8)\n\n4. **Determine the Claim's Validity:**\n   - Tie no 7 has an attendance of 10,420.\n   - The highest attendance is for tie no 6 with 67,228.\n   - Therefore, tie no 7 does not have the highest attendance.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is FALSE because tie no 7 does not have the highest attendance.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified feature games and extracted their attendances.

Tie No 6: 67,228\n2. Tie No 8: 38,136\n3. Replay (West Ham United vs Fulham): 27,934\n4. Tie No 1: 34,669\n5. Tie No 2: 24,966\n6. Replay (Birmingham City vs Sunderland): 25,645\n7.

Tie No 7: 10,420\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Second Highest Attendance\n\nFrom the sorted list, identify the second highest attendance:\n\n- The second highest attendance is for Tie No 8 (Arsenal vs Chelsea) with an attendance of 38,136.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Claim\n\nThe claim states that \"tie no 1 be the game with the second highest attendance.\" However, from our sorted list, we determined that the game with the second highest attendance is actually Tie No 8 (Arsenal vs Chelsea), not Tie No 1.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince Tie No 1 does not have the second highest attendance, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Extracted attendance numbers for all games.\",\n    \"Sorted attendance numbers in descending order: [67228, 38136, 27934, 34669, 24966, 25645, 14705, 17074, 19529, 12215, 10420].\",\n    \"Identified the second highest attendance as 38,136 for Tie No 8.\",\n    \"Compared with claim: 'tie no 1 be the game with the second highest attendance' is FALSE because Tie No 8 has the second highest.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
