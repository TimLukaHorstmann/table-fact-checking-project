    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, let's break down the steps involved:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Claim**: \n   - The claim states that \"5 - 4 (ot) be the score that have a location and attendance of montreal forum and the date after may 10\".\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Information**:\n   - We need to find any row where the score is \"5 - 4 (ot)\".\n   - Check if this score corresponds to a game played at \"montreal forum\".\n   - Ensure that the game occurred on a date after May 10.\n\n3. **Analyze the Table Data**:\n   - Look for the score \"5 - 4 (ot)\" in the data column under \"score\".\n\n4. **Locate the Relevant Row(s)**:\n   - Find the row with the score \"5 - 4 (ot)\":\n     ```json\n     [\n       \"may 10\",\n       \"bruins\",\n       \"5 - 4 (ot)\",\n       \"montreal forum\",\n       \"mtl 4 - 3\"\n     ]\n     ```\n   - This is at row index 6.\n\n5. **Check the Location**:\n   - Verify that the location for this score is indeed \"montreal forum\". \n   - The location in row index 6 matches: \"montreal forum\".\n\n6. **Verify the Date Condition**:\n   - Check if the date of this game is after May 10.\n   - The date here is exactly \"may 10\", not after.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is no entry for a score of \"5 - 4 (ot)\" that occurs at \"montreal forum\" on a date after May 10, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires finding a game with the score '5 - 4 (ot)' played at 'montreal forum' after May 10. The only entry with this score and location is on May 10, not after. Therefore, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
