This date corresponds to the event \"grand prix de plumelec - morbihan\".\n\n2. **Check Series Leader Column:**\n   - Once we find this row, examine the \"series leader\" column to see who was listed as the series leader on that date.\n\n3. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - The claim states that David Lelay (fra) was the series leader on May 31. Compare this information with what is found in the \"series leader\" column for the identified row.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - If the value in the \"series leader\" column matches \"david lelay ( fra )\", then the claim is TRUE.\n   - Otherwise, if it does not match, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Applying the Steps to the Table:\n\n- Locate the row where \"date\" is \"may 31\":\n  ```json\n  [\n    \"may 31\",\n    \"grand prix de plumelec - morbihan\",\n    \"thomas voeckler ( fra )\",\n    \"bouygues t\u00e9l\u00e9cobm\",\n    \"david lelay ( fra )\"\n  ]\n  ```\n\n- Check the \"series leader\" column for this row:\n  - The value is \"david lelay ( fra )\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that David Lelay (fra) was the series leader on May 31 is TRUE, as verified by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the row with 'date' as 'may 31'.
