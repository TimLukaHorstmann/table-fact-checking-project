This corresponds to:\n    - Row Index: 5\n    - Data: `[\"carlton\", \"13.7 (85)\", \"south melbourne\", \"8.14 (62)\", \"mcg\", 24287, \"9 august 1981\"]`\n  - Check the \"venue\" for this row: It is \"mcg\".\n\n- **Step 5:** The venue for the game on August 9, 1981, is indeed \"MCG\". Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the relevant date '8 August 1981' and '9 August 1981'.
