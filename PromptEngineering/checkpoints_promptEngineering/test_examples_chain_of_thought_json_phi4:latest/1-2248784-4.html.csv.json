Upon examining the table, all values in the 'rank mideast' column (1 through 13) are distinct. Similarly, all values in the 'rank asia' column (6, 9, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 26, 29, 30, 31, 35, 37) are also unique. Therefore, each country has a unique rank in both categories.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rank mideast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"rank mideast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"rank mideast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"rank mideast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"rank mideast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"rank mideast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"rank mideast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"rank mideast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"rank mideast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"rank mideast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"rank mideast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"rank mideast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"rank mideast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rank asia\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"rank asia\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"rank asia\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"rank asia\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"rank asia\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"rank asia\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"rank asia\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"rank asia\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"rank asia\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"rank asia\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"rank asia\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"rank asia\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"rank asia\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
