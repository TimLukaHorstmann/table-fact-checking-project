This is at `row_index` 1.\n\n2. **Verify the location of the Ju-52 aircraft**:\n   - Check the \"location\" column for the row identified in step 1.\n   - For `row_index` 1, the \"location\" is \"lagoa p\u00e1tie\", not \"off maputo\".\n   \n3. **Verify the number of fatalities for the Ju-52 aircraft**:\n   - Check the \"fatalities\" column for the row identified in step 1.\n   - For `row_index` 1, the \"fatalities\" are listed as \"unknown\", not \"0 / 108\".\n\nBoth parts of the claim are incorrect based on the table data.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, let's go through a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The claim involves checking the number of fatalities for an aircraft with a specific tail number \"c9 - bad\". Thus, we need to focus on the columns labeled \"tail number\" and \"fatalities\".\n\n2. **Locate the Aircraft by Tail Number**:\n   - We search through the data rows for an entry where the \"tail number\" is \"c9 - bad\".\n   - In the provided table, this corresponds to the row with index 4.\n\n3. **Check Fatalities for the Identified Row**:\n   - Once we have identified the row with tail number \"c9 - bad\", we examine the \"fatalities\" column in that same row.\n   - The entry for fatalities in row index 4 is \"0 / 108\".\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the aircraft with tail number \"c9 - bad\" has an unknown number of fatalities.\n   - However, we found that the number of fatalities is specified as \"0 / 108\", which means there were 0 fatalities among 108 people on board.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the number of fatalities for the aircraft with tail number \"c9 - bad\" is known and not unknown, the claim is false.\n\nBased on this reasoning process:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The task requires checking the 'fatalities' for an aircraft with the 'tail number' c9 - bad.\",\n    \"Identify rows in the table where the tail number matches 'c9 - bad'.\",\n    \"Row index 4 has the tail number 'c9 - bad'.\",\n    \"Check the 'fatalities' value in row index 4, which is '0 / 108'.\",\n    \"The claim states that fatalities are unknown, but they are actually known as '0 / 108'.\",\n    \"Therefore, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tail number\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"fatalities\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
