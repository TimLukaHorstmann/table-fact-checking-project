This is a tied game.\n   - **Row 1:** \"lille osc (d1)\" vs. \"aj auxerre (d1)\" with a score of \"2 - 2\". This is also a tied game.\n   - **Row 3:** \"stade de reims (d2)\" vs. \"le havre ac (d1)\" has a score of \"2 - 1\", not a tie.\n   - **Row 4:** \"fc metz (d1)\" vs. \"fc mulhouse (d2)\" with a score of \"3 - 0\", not a tie.\n   - **Row 5:** \"fc s\u00e8te (d2)\" vs. \"rc lens (d1)\" with a score of \"0 - 1\", not a tie.\n   - **Row 6:** \"aep bourg sous la roche (d2)\" vs. \"stade quimp\u00e9rois (d2)\" has a score of \"3 - 5\", not a tie.\n   - **Row 7:** \"so ch\u00e2tellerault (d2)\" vs. \"us cr\u00e9teil (d3)\" with a score of \"0 - 0\". This is a tied game.\n\n3. **Count the Number of Tied Games:**\n   - We identified three tied games: \n     - Row 0 (\"toulouse fc\" vs. \"ogc nice\")\n     - Row 1 (\"lille osc\" vs. \"aj auxerre\")\n     - Row 7 (\"so ch\u00e2tellerault\" vs. \"us cr\u00e9teil\")\n\n4. **Determine if Any of the Tied Games Went to Penalty Kicks:**\n   - The table does not provide explicit information about penalty kicks. However, typically in such contexts, a tie after regulation would imply that one or both games could go to penalties unless otherwise specified.\n   - Since we have three tied games and the claim states \"2 of those go to penalty kick,\" it implies at least two of these ties are resolved by penalties.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is plausible given the typical rules of football where ties after regulation often lead to penalty shootouts unless otherwise stated.\n   - Without explicit information about penalties, we assume the standard practice applies.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Three games ended in a tie: 'toulouse fc' vs. 'ogc nice', 'lille osc' vs. 'aj auxerre', and 'so ch\u00e2tellerault' vs. 'us cr\u00e9teil'.

The division information is part of the team name (e.g., \"(d1)\", \"(d2)\", \"(d3)\").\n\n3. **Check if there is more than one d3 team:**\n   - If we find only \"us cr\u00e9teil\" as a d3 team, then the claim is true.\n   - If we find another team from division 3, then the claim is false.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Row 0:** \n   - Team 2: \"ogc nice (d1)\" \u2014 Not a d3 team.\n\n2. **Row 1:** \n   - Team 2: \"aj auxerre (d1)\" \u2014 Not a d3 team.\n\n3. **Row 2:** \n   - Team 2: \"fc sochaux - montb\u00e9liard (d2)\" \u2014 Not a d3 team.\n\n4. **Row 3:** \n   - Team 2: \"le havre ac (d1)\" \u2014 Not a d3 team.\n\n5. **Row 4:** \n   - Team 2: \"fc metz (d1)\" \u2014 Not a d3 team.\n\n6. **Row 5:** \n   - Team 2: \"rc lens (d1)\" \u2014 Not a d3 team.\n\n7. **Row 6:** \n   - Team 2: \"stade quimperois (d2)\" \u2014 Not a d3 team.\n\n8. **Row 7:** \n   - Team 2: \"us cr\u00e9teil (d3)\" \u2014 This is the only d3 team identified so far.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- After examining all rows, \"us cr\u00e9teil\" is indeed the only d3 team that competes in the round of 16 according to the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.

Le Havre lost the first but won the second. Both teams scored a point.\n\n   - **Row 4:**\n     - Teams: FC Metz vs FC Mulhouse\n     - Scores: \"1 - 0\" (1st round), \"2 - 0\" (2nd round)\n     - Outcome: Metz won both rounds.
