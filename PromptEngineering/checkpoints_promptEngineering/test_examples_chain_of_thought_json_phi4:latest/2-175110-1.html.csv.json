    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Rhodesia's medal count is true, we will go through each part of the claim step-by-step and verify it against the data provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Locate Rhodesia's Data:**\n   - According to the JSON data, we need to find the row corresponding to \"rhodesia\". From the table:\n     ```json\n     [\n       5,\n       \"rhodesia\",\n       10,\n       5,\n       2,\n       17\n     ]\n     ```\n   - This indicates that Rhodesia is ranked 5th.\n\n2. **Verify Gold Medals:**\n   - The claim states that Rhodesia has 10 gold medals.\n   - From the table, under the \"gold\" column for Rhodesia (row index 5), we see:\n     ```json\n     10\n     ```\n   - This matches the claim.\n\n3. **Verify Silver Medals:**\n   - The claim states that Rhodesia has 5 silver medals.\n   - From the table, under the \"silver\" column for Rhodesia (row index 5), we see:\n     ```json\n     5\n     ```\n   - This also matches the claim.\n\n4. **Verify Bronze Medals:**\n   - The claim states that Rhodesia has 2 bronze medals.\n   - From the table, under the \"bronze\" column for Rhodesia (row index 5), we see:\n     ```json\n     2\n     ```\n   - This matches the claim as well.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince all parts of the claim about Rhodesia's medal count are verified against the data and found to be correct, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, I located the row corresponding to 'rhodesia' in the table. Then, I checked each part of the claim: 10 gold medals, 5 silver medals, and 2 bronze medals against the data for Rhodesia. All parts matched the table's information.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
