This corresponds to a specific match between Los Angeles and Vancouver.\n\n3. **Home Team (Vancouver)**:\n   - Identify rows where the home team is Vancouver by checking the \"home\" column.\n\n4. **Score of 3 - 5**:\n   - Find rows with the score \"3 - 5\".\n\n5. **Date May 13**:\n   - Verify that there is a match on May 13 and check all conditions for this date.\n\n### Detailed Verification:\n\n1. **Decision (Mclean)**:\n   - All entries in the \"decision\" column are Mclean.\n   \n2. **Series at 2 - 3**:\n   - The series \"2 - 3\" is found in row index 4.\n\n3. **Home Team (Vancouver)**:\n   - Vancouver is listed as home team in rows with indices 2 and 3.\n\n4. **Score of 3 - 5**:\n   - The score \"3 - 5\" appears in row index 5.\n\n5. **Date May 13**:\n   - On May 13 (row index 5), the match details are:\n     - Visitor: Vancouver\n     - Score: 3 - 5\n     - Home: Los Angeles\n     - Decision: Mclean\n     - Attendance: 16005\n     - Series: 2 - 4\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that on May 13, with the decision being Mclean and the series at 2 - 3, the home team is Vancouver, and the score is 3 - 5.
