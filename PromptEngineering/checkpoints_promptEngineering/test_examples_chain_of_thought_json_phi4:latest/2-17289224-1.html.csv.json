    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, let's break down the task step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Claim\nThe claim states: \n- \"In season of 2005, the sum of poles with the series of formula three sudamericana be 1.\"\n\nThis means we need to check:\n- If there is any entry in the table for the year 2005.\n- If that entry corresponds to the series \"formula three sudamericana.\"\n- What the number of poles (\"poles\" column) is for this specific entry.\n- Whether the sum of these poles equals 1.\n\n### Step 2: Locate Entries for the Year 2005\nWe need to find all rows in the data that have the season \"2005.\"\n\n### Step 3: Filter by Series\nFrom the entries found in step 2, we further filter them to see if they match the series \"formula three sudamericana.\"\n\n### Step 4: Check the Number of Poles\nFor the filtered entry (or entries) from step 3, check the value in the \"poles\" column.\n\n### Step 5: Sum and Verify Against Claim\nSum the poles for all relevant entries. According to the claim, this sum should be equal to 1.\n\n### Execution\n\n#### Locate Entries for Year 2005:\n- Entry 4: [\"2005\", \"formula three sudamericana\", \"bassani racing\", 18, 1, 3, 72, \"4th\"]\n- Entry 5: [\"2005\", \"formula renault 2.0 brazil\", \"gramacho racing\", 3, 0, 0, 44, \"12th\"]\n\n#### Filter by Series:\nFrom the entries above, only entry 4 matches the series \"formula three sudamericana.\"\n\n#### Check the Number of Poles:\n- Entry 4: The number of poles is 1.\n\n#### Sum and Verify Against Claim:\nSince there is only one relevant entry (entry 4) with a pole count of 1, the sum of poles for \"formula three sudamericana\" in 2005 is indeed 1.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim is TRUE. The number of poles in the 2005 season for the series \"formula three sudamericana\" sums to 1.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify entries with the year '2005'.\",\n    \"Filter these entries by the series 'formula three sudamericana'.\",\n    \"Check the value in the 'poles' column for the filtered entry.\",\n    \"Sum the poles (only one relevant entry found).\",\n    \"Verify if this sum equals 1 as per the claim.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"poles\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
