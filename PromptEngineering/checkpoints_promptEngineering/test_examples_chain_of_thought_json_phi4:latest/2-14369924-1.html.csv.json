However, neither `w290ag` nor `w230av` has an ERP W of 55. Therefore, the first part of the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Step 3: Verify City of License\n\n- **For `w290ag`:**\n  - The city of license is Griffin, Georgia.\n\n- **For `w230av`:**\n  - The city of license is Gadsden, Alabama.\n\nThe claim states that one should have a city of license of Anniston, Alabama, and the other Macon, Georgia. However:\n- `w269ax` has the city of license Anniston, Alabama.\n- `w282ae` has the city of license Macon, Georgia.\n\nNeither `w290ag` nor `w230av` matches the cities mentioned in the claim.
