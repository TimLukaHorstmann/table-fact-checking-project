We first need to locate this tournament in the table.\n   - In the data, there is a section labeled \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final\", followed by several matches.\n\n2. **Examine Matches for Gavle:**\n   - The claim specifies that Tisha Venturini played four matches at Gavle during this tournament.\n   - We need to check each match entry under the \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final\" section to see which ones were held in Gavle.\n\n3. **Check Each Match:**\n   - Match 1: Date \"1995-06-06\", Location \"Gavle\".\n   - Match 2: Date \"1995-06-08\", Location \"Gavle\".\n   - Match 4: Date \"1995-06-13\", Location \"Gavle\".\n   - These matches are indeed held in Gavle.\n\n4. **Verify Number of Matches at Gavle:**\n   - There are three matches listed as being held in Gavle (Match 1, Match 2, and Match 4).\n\n5. **Check for Tisha Venturini's Participation:**\n   - The claim involves Tisha Venturini, but the table does not provide player-specific information such as who played in which match.\n   - We only have access to the \"lineup\" column, which indicates if a player participated or substituted (e.g., \"start\", \"80' (cromwell)\"). However, it does not specify which players are involved.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the data provided, we can confirm that there were only three matches played in Gavle during the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup.\n   - Without specific information about Tisha Venturini's participation, we cannot definitively say she played four matches at Gavle.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim involves determining if Tisha Venturini played four matches in Gavle during the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup.

Although the match was decided by penalty shootout (indicated as \"pso 5 - 4\"), the regulation time result was \"0 - 0\", indicating it ended in a draw at full-time.\n\n3. **Verify All Conditions**:\n   - We need to confirm that these matches are indeed associated with Tisha Venturini's career, but since the claim specifically refers to dates and results, we focus on confirming the draws for those dates.\n   - The table does not provide explicit information about individual players' participation in each match. However, based on the claim structure, it is implied that these matches are part of her career.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - All three specified dates correspond to matches that ended in a draw according to the results provided in the table.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify draw matches by checking for results like '3 - 3' or '0 - 0'.\",\n    \"Check date 1995-06-06: Row index 1 has result '3 - 3', indicating a draw.\",\n    \"Check date 1996-07-25: Row index 9 has result '0 - 0', indicating a draw.\",\n    \"Check date 1999-07-10: Row index 13 shows '0 - 0' at full-time, decided by penalty shootout, indicating a draw in regular time.\",\n    \"All specified dates correspond to matches that ended in a draw.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
