We need to find entries where the \"date sent\" is \"july 6, 2003\".\n   \n2. **Extract Entries Sent on July 6, 2003**:\n   - From the table data, we extract rows with \"date sent\" as \"july 6 , 2003\":\n     - Row 5: `hip 4872`, constellation: `cassiopeia`, arrival date: `april 2036`\n     - Row 6: `hd 245409`, constellation: `orion`, arrival date: `august 2040`\n     - Row 7: `hd 75732`, constellation: `cancer`, arrival date: `may 2044`\n     - Row 8: `hd 10307`, constellation: `andromeda`, arrival date: `september 2044`\n     - Row 9: `hd 95128`, constellation: `ursa major`, arrival date: `may 2049`\n\n3. **Filter for Designation \"HD\"**:\n   - We need to focus only on those entries where the designation starts with \"hd\". This excludes row 5 (`hip 4872`).\n   - Relevant rows are:\n     - Row 6: `hd 245409`, arrival date: `august 2040`\n     - Row 7: `hd 75732`, arrival date: `may 2044`\n     - Row 8: `hd 10307`, arrival date: `september 2044`\n     - Row 9: `hd 95128`, arrival date: `may 2049`\n\n4. **Check Number of Relevant Entries**:\n   - We have four entries with designation \"HD\" sent on July 6, 2003.\n\n5. **Verify Arrival Date Range**:\n   - The claim specifies an arrival date range from \"april 2036\" to \"may 2044\".\n   - Check the arrival dates of the filtered rows:\n     - Row 6: `august 2040` (within range)\n     - Row 7: `may 2044` (within range)\n     - Row 8: `september 2044` (outside range)\n     - Row 9: `may 2049` (outside range)\n\n6. **Count Entries Within the Specified Date Range**:\n   - Only two entries fall within the specified arrival date range (Row 6 and Row 7).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that \"3 designation hds be send on july 6 , 2003, with arrival date range from april 2036 to may 2044\".
