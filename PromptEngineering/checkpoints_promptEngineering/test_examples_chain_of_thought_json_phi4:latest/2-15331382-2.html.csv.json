In this case, we assume the table is for the Chargers as there are no indications otherwise.\n\n5. **Determine ranking**: Rank all games by attendance and check where the November 21, 2004, game stands.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n- **Step 1: Identify relevant row**\n  - The entry for \"November 21, 2004\" is in row index 10 (using zero-based indexing).\n\n- **Step 2: Check attendance value**\n  - For November 21, 2004, the attendance was 46,905.\n\n- **Step 3: Compare with other attendances**\n  - List of all attendance figures:\n    - Week 1: 70,255\n    - Week 2: 57,310\n    - Week 3: 74,553\n    - Week 4: 54,006\n    - Week 5: 52,101\n    - Week 6: 70,187\n    - Week 7: 73,096\n    - Week 8: 66,210\n    - Week 9: 59,662\n    - **Week 11 (November 21): 46,905**\n    - Week 12: 77,447\n    - Week 13: 65,395\n    - Week 14: 65,858\n    - Week 15: 72,489\n    - Week 16: 57,330\n    - Week 17: 64,920\n\n- **Step 4: Verify team name**\n  - The opponent on November 21, 2004, was the Oakland Raiders.
