    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate each player drafted in round 4 to see if they are an offensive position for the Indianapolis Colts.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Round 4 Players:**\n   - We need to look at the data entries where `round` equals 4.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Data from Round 4:**\n   - From the table, round 4 has two players:\n     - Pick 11: Kendyll Pope, Linebacker, Florida State\n     - Pick 29: Jason David, Cornerback, Washington State\n\n3. **Determine Position Type:**\n   - Positions need to be classified as offensive or defensive.\n   - Offense positions typically include Quarterback, Running Back, Wide Receiver, Tight End, Offensive Lineman (like Guard), etc.\n   - Defense positions include Linebacker, Defensive Lineman, Cornerback, Safety, etc.\n\n4. **Evaluate Each Player's Position:**\n   - Kendyll Pope is a \"Linebacker.\" This position is part of the defense.\n   - Jason David is a \"Cornerback.\" This position is also part of the defense.\n\n5. **Assess the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that 4 offensive players were drafted by the Indianapolis Colts in round 4.\n   - From our evaluation, both players picked in round 4 are on defense, not offense.\n   - Therefore, no offensive players were drafted in this round.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there are zero offensive players drafted in round 4, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify players from round 4.
