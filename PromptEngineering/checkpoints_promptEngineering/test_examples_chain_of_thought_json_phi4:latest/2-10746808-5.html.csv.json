Confirm if the largest crowd size is 28,628.\n\nLet's break down these steps using the data from the table:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Crowd Sizes:**\n   - Extract the crowd sizes from each row in the \"crowd\" column:\n     - Melbourne vs Richmond: 28,628\n     - Essendon vs St Kilda: 20,000\n     - South Melbourne vs North Melbourne: 15,000\n     - Hawthorn vs Footscray: 10,000\n     - Geelong vs Collingwood: 19,500\n     - Fitzroy vs Carlton: 25,000\n\n2. **Determine the Smallest Crowd Size:**\n   - From the extracted crowd sizes (28,628; 20,000; 15,000; 10,000; 19,500; 25,000), identify the smallest value.\n   - The smallest crowd size is 10,000.\n\n3. **Check if Smallest Crowd Size < 10,000:**\n   - Since the smallest crowd size is exactly 10,000, it is not less than 10,000.\n\n4. **Determine the Largest Crowd Size:**\n   - From the extracted crowd sizes, identify the largest value.\n   - The largest crowd size is 28,628.\n\n5. **Check if Largest Crowd Size is 28,628:**\n   - The largest crowd size matches 28,628 as stated in the claim.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The first part of the claim (\"the smallest crowd size be less than 10,000\") is false because the smallest crowd size is exactly 10,000.\n- The second part of the claim (\"the largest crowd side be 28628\") is true because the largest crowd size is indeed 28,628.\n\nSince both parts need to be true for the entire claim to be true and one part is false, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells are those that contain the \"crowd\" sizes:\n\n- Row 1, Column \"crowd\": 28628\n- Row 2, Column \"crowd\": 20000\n- Row 3, Column \"crowd\": 15000\n- Row 4, Column \"crowd\": 10000\n- Row 5, Column \"crowd\": 19500\n- Row 6, Column \"crowd\": 25000\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
