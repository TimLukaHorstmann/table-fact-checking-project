In Australian rules football scoring:\n    - Each goal (worth 6 points) and behind (worth 1 point) contributes to the total.\n    - The conversion from goals and behinds to points is calculated as follows: \n      \\[\n      \\text{Total Points} = (\\text{Goals} \\times 6) + \\text{Behinds}\n      \\]\n    - Therefore, South Melbourne's total score in points:\n      \\[\n      (18 \\times 6) + 12 = 108 + 12 = 120\n      \\]\n\n- **Richmond Score**:\n  - Richmond scored `4.4 (28)`:\n    \\[\n    (4 \\times 6) + 4 = 24 + 4 = 28\n    \\]\n\n- **Carlton Score**:\n  - Carlton scored `6.13 (49)`:\n    \\[\n    (6 \\times 6) + 13 = 36 + 13 = 49\n    \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Combined Points for Richmond and Carlton\n\nTo find out if South Melbourne's score is less than the combined points of Richmond and Carlton:\n\n- **Combined Points**:\n  - Add Richmond's and Carlton's scores together:\n  \\[\n  28 + 49 = 77\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Compare Scores\n\n- South Melbourne scored `120` points.\n- Combined, Richmond and Carlton scored `77` points.\n\nSince 120 is greater than 77, the claim that \"south melbourne score less point than richmond and carlton combine\" is FALSE.\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified scores: South Melbourne 18.12 (120), Richmond 4.4 (28), Carlton 6.13 (49).
