    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the only driver to win both races on the same circuit be Lex Davison\" is true or false, we need to evaluate each row of data for repeated circuits and verify if Lex Davison was a winner at more than one race held at those circuits. Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. **Examine Each Circuit:**\n   - We need to identify any circuit that hosts more than one race in this dataset.\n\n2. **Identify Repeated Circuits:**\n   - From the data:\n     - \"lowood circuit\" appears twice (rows 5 and 6).\n     - All other circuits appear only once.\n\n3. **Check Winners for Repeated Circuit:**\n   - For the \"lowood circuit\":\n     - On \"15 june\", Alec Mildren won.\n     - On \"31 august\", Alec Mildren also won.\n   - Lex Davison did not win any race on the lowood circuit; Alec Mildren did.\n\n4. **Conclusion about Other Circuits:**\n   - All other circuits are unique to one event each, meaning no other driver can have multiple wins at a single circuit from this dataset.\n\n5. **Evaluate Claim for Lex Davison:**\n   - Lex Davison won the \"australian grand prix\" on \"23 october\" at the \"mount panorama circuit\".\n   - There is only one race listed at the \"mount panorama circuit\", so there's no possibility of him winning more than one race at this circuit.\n\n6. **Final Assessment:**\n   - Since Alec Mildren won both races at lowood circuit, and Lex Davison did not win any two races on a single circuit, the claim is false.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify circuits with more than one race in the dataset.\",\n    \"The 'lowood circuit' hosts two races: on 15 June and 31 August.\",\n    \"Alec Mildren won both races at the 'lowood circuit'.\",\n    \"Lex Davison only has a win listed for 'mount panorama circuit', where there is only one race.\",\n    \"Thus, Lex Davison did not win multiple races on any single circuit.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"circuit\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"circuit\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"winner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
