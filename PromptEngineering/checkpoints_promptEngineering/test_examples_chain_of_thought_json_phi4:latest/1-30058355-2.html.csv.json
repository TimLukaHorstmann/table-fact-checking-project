Verify the specific riders and their times for both Wednesday, August 24, and Thursday, August 25.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate the Wednesday, August 24, Time:**\n   - We need to find which rider has a time of \"19'59.73 113.216 mph\" on Wednesday, August 24.\n   - By checking each entry under the column \"wed 24 aug,\" we identify that Paul Smyth (row index 5) has this exact time.\n\n2. **Verify Thursday, August 25, Time for the Same Rider:**\n   - For Paul Smyth, check his time on \"thurs 25 aug.\"\n   - In row index 5 under the column \"thurs 25 aug,\" we find \"20'45.61 109.046 mph.\"\n\n3. **Compare with Claimed Time:**\n   - The claim states \"20'45.61 110.055 mph\" for Thursday, August 25.\n   - We found \"20'45.61 109.046 mph,\" which is different from the claimed speed.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that Paul Smyth's time on Thursday, August 25, was \"20'45.61 110.055 mph\" when it was actually \"20'45.61 109.046 mph\" is incorrect.
