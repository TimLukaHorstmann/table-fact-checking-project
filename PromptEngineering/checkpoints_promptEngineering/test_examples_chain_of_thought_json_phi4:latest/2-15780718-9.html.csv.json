    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"michael bradley jelani mccoy (14) have the highest rebound against miami\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Matches:**\n   - We are interested in games where the team played against Miami.\n   - From the data:\n     - Game 77: April 8, against Miami\n     - Game 81: April 15, at Miami\n\n2. **Check Rebound Data for These Games:**\n   - For each game against Miami, examine the \"high rebounds\" column to see who had the highest rebounds.\n\n3. **Game 77 (April 8) Analysis:**\n   - The team lost to Miami with a score of 83 - 89 (OT).\n   - High Rebounds: Michael Bradley (8)\n   - Jelani McCoy is not listed in this game's high rebounds column.\n   - Conclusion: Michael Bradley had 8 rebounds, and Jelani McCoy had none.\n\n4. **Game 81 (April 15) Analysis:**\n   - The team lost to Miami with a score of 99 - 103 (OT).\n   - High Rebounds: Jerome Williams (17)\n   - Neither Michael Bradley nor Jelani McCoy is listed in this game's high rebounds column.\n   - Conclusion: Jerome Williams had the highest rebounds, and neither Michael Bradley nor Jelani McCoy reached the rebound count of 14.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy have a combined or individual high rebound count of 14 against Miami.\n   - In both games, neither player achieved this rebound count:\n     - Game 77: Michael Bradley had 8 rebounds.\n     - Game 81: Neither played with a high rebound count.\n\n6. **Final Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is false because the highest rebound count by either Michael Bradley or Jelani McCoy in any game against Miami does not reach 14.\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify games played against Miami (Games 77 and 81).
