This implies each player's total score is a sum of four individual round scores.\n\n2. **Examine the Data Structure**:\n   - Each row represents a player.\n   - The \"score\" column shows the total score for each player, broken down into four rounds (e.g., \"66 + 72 + 75 + 70 = 283\").\n\n3. **Verify Round Scores**:\n   - For each player, check if their score is presented as a sum of four individual round scores.\n   - Example: Byron Nelson's score is \"66 + 72 + 75 + 70 = 283\", which clearly shows four rounds.\n\n4. **Check All Players**:\n   - Repeat the verification for all players listed in the data to ensure consistency.\n   - Ralph Guldahl: \"69 + 72 + 68 + 76 = 285\"\n   - Ed Dudley: \"70 + 71 + 71 + 74 = 286\"\n   - Harry Cooper: \"73 + 69 + 71 + 74 = 287\"\n   - Ky Laffoon: \"73 + 70 + 74 + 73 = 290\"\n   - Jimmy Thomson: \"71 + 73 + 74 + 73 = 291\"\n   - Al Watrous: \"74 + 72 + 71 + 75 = 292\"\n   - Tommy Armour: \"73 + 75 + 73 + 72 = 293\"\n   - Vic Ghezzi: \"72 + 72 + 72 + 77 = 293\"\n   - Leonard Dodson: \"71 + 75 + 71 + 77 = 294\"\n   - Jimmy Hines: \"77 + 72 + 68 + 77 = 294\"\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Each player's score is indeed the sum of four rounds.\n   - Therefore, it confirms that players in this tournament played 4 rounds.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that players in the 1937 Master's Tournament had to play 4 rounds.
