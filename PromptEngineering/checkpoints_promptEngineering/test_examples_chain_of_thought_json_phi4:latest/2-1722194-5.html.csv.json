    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Place Ville Marie be the tallest building for the least amount of year\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The statement suggests that Place Ville Marie was the tallest building for a shorter duration than any other building in the list.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Data**:\n   - We are interested in the \"years as tallest\" and \"of years as tallest\" columns to determine how long each building held the title of the tallest.\n   \n3. **Analyzing Each Building's Duration**:\n   - Notre Dame Basilica: 99 years\n   - Royal Bank Building: 3 years\n   - Sun Life Building: 31 years\n   - Tour CIBC: <1 year (less than a full year, but not specified exactly)\n   - Place Ville Marie: 2 years\n   - Tour de la Bourse: 28 years\n   - 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re: 21 years (current)\n\n4. **Comparing Durations**:\n   - Tour CIBC was the tallest for less than a year, which is shorter than Place Ville Marie's duration of 2 years.\n   - All other buildings held the title longer than Place Ville Marie.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since Tour CIBC was the tallest building for less than a year, it held the title for a shorter period than Place Ville Marie.\n\n6. **Final Answer**:\n   - The claim is false because there is another building (Tour CIBC) that was the tallest for a shorter duration than Place Ville Marie.\n\nHere is the final JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim suggests Place Ville Marie held the title of tallest for the least amount of time.\",\n    \"We examine the 'years as tallest' column to compare durations.\",\n    \"Notre Dame Basilica: 99 years, Royal Bank Building: 3 years, Sun Life Building: 31 years, Tour CIBC: <1 year, Place Ville Marie: 2 years, Tour de la Bourse: 28 years, 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re: 21 years.\",\n    \"Tour CIBC was the tallest for less than a year, which is shorter than Place Ville Marie's 2 years.\",\n    \"Therefore, the claim is false as there is another building with a shorter duration.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
