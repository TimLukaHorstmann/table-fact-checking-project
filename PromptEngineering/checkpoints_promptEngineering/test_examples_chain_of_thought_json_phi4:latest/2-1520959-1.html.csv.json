    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the g force and the trouble truck runaway coaster were constructed at the same time\" is true or false, we need to compare the years they were opened.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**:\n   - We are interested in rows corresponding to the rides \"G Force\" and \"Troublesome Trucks Runaway Coaster\".\n\n2. **Locate the Year of Opening for Each Ride**:\n   - For \"G Force\":\n     - Find the row where the name is \"g force\".\n     - Extract the value from the column \"opened\".\n   - For \"Troublesome Trucks Runaway Coaster\":\n     - Find the row where the name is \"troublesome trucks runaway coaster\".\n     - Extract the value from the column \"opened\".\n\n3. **Extract and Compare Data**:\n   - \"G Force\" was opened in 2005.\n   - \"Troublesome Trucks Runaway Coaster\" was opened in 2008.\n\n4. **Determine if the Years are the Same**:\n   - Compare the years: 2005 (G Force) is not equal to 2008 (Troublesome Trucks Runaway Coaster).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe rides \"G Force\" and \"Troublesome Trucks Runaway Coaster\" were not constructed in the same year. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify rows for 'g force' and 'troublesome trucks runaway coaster'. Extract the 'opened' years: 2005 and 2008, respectively.
