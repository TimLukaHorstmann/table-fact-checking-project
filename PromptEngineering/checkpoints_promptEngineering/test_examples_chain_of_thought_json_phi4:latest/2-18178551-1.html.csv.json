However, assuming it refers to scoring points, we need to verify if 0 is the highest score.\n   - Since 0 points are scored against Argentina in this match, it cannot be considered as having coned (scored) the most points.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim implies that England scored a high number of points against Argentina, but the data shows they scored 0 points.\n   - Therefore, the statement is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The row with 'argentina' as the opposing team shows that England scored 0 points.
