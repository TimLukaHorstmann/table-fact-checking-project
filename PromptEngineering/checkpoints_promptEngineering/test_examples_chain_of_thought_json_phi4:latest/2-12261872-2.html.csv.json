    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"3 riders lead Tony Rominger at different points in the 1995\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data focusing on changes in the general classification (GC) column.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that three different riders were ahead of Tony Rominger at various stages during the 1995 race. This means we need to check the \"general classification\" column for changes in leadership before and after each stage.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - We will examine the \"stage\" and \"general classification\" columns to see who was leading at each stage and how it changed over time.\n\n3. **Initial General Classification**:\n   - At stage 1, Mario Cipollini is listed as the general classification leader.\n\n4. **Track Changes in Leadership**:\n   - Stage 2: Tony Rominger becomes the leader.\n     - Relevant cell: Row 2, \"general classification\" (Tony Rominger)\n   - From stages 3 to 21, Tony Rominger remains the leader.\n   - Final stage: Tony Rominger is still the leader.\n\n5. **Determine Different Leaders**:\n   - We need to identify any other riders who led at different points before Tony Rominger took over and maintained his lead until the end.\n   - From the data, Mario Cipollini was the only rider leading before Tony Rominger in stage 1.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Only one rider (Mario Cipollini) led before Tony Rominger. There are no other riders listed as leaders at different points after Tony Rominger took over.\n   - Therefore, the claim that \"3 riders lead Tony Rominger at different points\" is false.\n\n7. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - Row 1, \"general classification\": Mario Cipollini\n   - Row 2, \"general classification\": Tony Rominger\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that three different riders led Tony Rominger at various points.
