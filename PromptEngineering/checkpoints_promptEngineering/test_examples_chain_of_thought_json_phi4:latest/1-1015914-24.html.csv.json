    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"ngalben be the we two for the you two ngipeniya\" is TRUE or FALSE, let's break down the components of the claim using the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify \"ngalben\":**\n   - The term \"ngalben\" appears in the second row under the \"nom - acc - inst\" column labeled \"we two\".\n   - Therefore, \"ngalben\" is the genitive form of \"we two\".\n\n2. **Identify \"ngipeniya\":**\n   - The term \"ngipeniya\" appears in the fifth row under the \"loc\" column labeled \"you two\".\n   - Therefore, \"ngipeniya\" is the locative form of \"you two\".\n\n3. **Analyze the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"ngalben be the we two for the you two ngipeniya\".\n   - This implies a relationship where \"ngalben\" (genitive of \"we two\") is related to or associated with \"ngipeniya\" (locative of \"you two\").\n\n4. **Verify the Relationship:**\n   - The claim does not specify any grammatical rule or context that directly links the genitive form of one phrase (\"we two\") to the locative form of another phrase (\"you two\").\n   - In typical grammatical structures, forms like genitive and locative are used in specific contexts (e.g., possession for genitive, location for locative) and do not inherently link across different subject phrases unless specified by additional context or rules.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Without additional contextual information or a rule indicating that \"ngalben\" should be used with \"ngipeniya\", the claim lacks a clear grammatical basis.\n   - Therefore, based on the table alone, there is no evidence to support the claim as stated.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The term 'ngalben' is identified as the genitive form of 'we two', and 'ngipeniya' as the locative form of 'you two'. The claim suggests a relationship between these forms, but there is no grammatical rule or context provided in the table that links the genitive of one phrase to the locative of another. Therefore, the claim lacks basis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"we two\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"you two\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify if the given forms for \"you and I\" in ablative case match \"ng\u0153ba,\" and if the form for \"them two (the two)\" in ablative case matches \"palamulngu (boigu palemulngu).\" Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Row for Ablative Case:**\n   - The table has rows labeled by grammatical cases. We need to find the row corresponding to the \"abl\" case, which stands for ablative.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Column for \"You and I\":**\n   - In the header of the table under \"columns,\" we find that \"you and I\" corresponds to the column labeled \"you and i.\"\n\n3. **Find the Value in Ablative Case for \"You and I\":**\n   - Navigate to the \"abl\" row (4th row) and look at the value in the \"you and i\" column.\n   - The table entry is \"ngipelngu.\" This does not match \"ng\u0153ba.\"\n\n4. **Locate the Relevant Column for \"Them Two (the two)\":**\n   - Again, refer to the header under \"columns,\" where \"them two (the two)\" corresponds to the column labeled \"them two (the two).\"\n\n5. **Find the Value in Ablative Case for \"Them Two (the two)\":**\n   - In the \"abl\" row (4th row), look at the value in the \"them two (the two)\" column.\n   - The table entry is \"palamulngu (boigu palemulngu).\" This matches the claim.\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states, \"when you and I be ng\u0153ba, them two (the two) be palamulngu (boigu palemulngu).\"\n   - For the claim to be true, both parts need to match their respective table entries for the ablative case.\n   - Since \"you and I\" in the ablative is \"ngipelngu,\" not \"ng\u0153ba,\" the first part of the claim is false.\n\nBased on this reasoning:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row for the 'abl' case, which corresponds to the fourth row.\",\n    \"Locate the column for 'you and I,' found under 'you and i.'\",\n    \"In the ablative case ('abl'), find that the value is 'ngipelngu,' not 'ng\u0153ba'.\",\n    \"Locate the column for 'them two (the two),' found under 'them two (the two).'\",\n    \"In the ablative case, find that the value is 'palamulngu (boigu palemulngu)', which matches the claim.\",\n    \"Since one part of the claim does not match the table, the entire claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"you and i\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"them two (the two)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
