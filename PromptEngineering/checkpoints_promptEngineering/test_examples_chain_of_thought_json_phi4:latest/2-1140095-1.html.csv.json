    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true, we need to verify two main points:\n\n1. **Count the number of races won by constructors affiliated with Ford.**\n2. **Check if the French Grand Prix was included among these wins.**\n\nLet's break down the process step-by-step using the table data.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Constructors Affiliated with Ford\nFrom the \"constructor\" column, we can identify which races were won by teams that are affiliated with Ford:\n\n- **Lotus-Ford**\n- **McLaren-Ford**\n- **Matra-Ford**\n\n### Step 2: Count Wins for Each Constructor\n\nLet's go through each row to see if a race was won by any of the constructors listed above.\n\n1. **South African Grand Prix**: Won by Lotus-Ford\n2. **Spanish Grand Prix**: Won by Graham Hill (Lotus-Ford)\n3. **Monaco Grand Prix**: Won by Graham Hill (Lotus-Ford)\n4. **Belgian Grand Prix**: Won by Bruce McLaren (McLaren-Ford)\n5. **Dutch Grand Prix**: Won by Jackie Stewart (Matra-Ford)\n6. **French Grand Prix**: Won by Jacky Ickx (Ferrari) - Not a Ford-affiliated constructor\n7. **British Grand Prix**: Won by Jo Siffert (Lotus-Ford)\n8. **German Grand Prix**: Won by Jackie Stewart (Matra-Ford)\n9. **Italian Grand Prix**: Won by Denny Hulme (McLaren-Ford)\n10. **Canadian Grand Prix**: Won by Denny Hulme (McLaren-Ford)\n11. **United States Grand Prix**: Won by Jackie Stewart (Matra-Ford)\n12. **Mexican Grand Prix**: Won by Graham Hill (Lotus-Ford)\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Claim\n- The total number of races is 12.\n- Races won by Ford-affiliated constructors: South African, Spanish, Monaco, Belgian, Dutch, British, German, Italian, Canadian, United States, and Mexican Grand Prixes. This accounts for 11 races.\n- The French Grand Prix was not won by a Ford-affiliated constructor.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim states that a constructor affiliated with Ford wins all but 2 races, including the French Grand Prix. However, we found that a Ford-affiliated constructor won 11 out of 12 races (only missing the French Grand Prix), which means they missed only one race, not two.\n\nTherefore, the claim is **FALSE** because:\n- A Ford-affiliated constructor did not miss exactly two races.\n- The French Grand Prix was indeed not won by a Ford-affiliated constructor.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify constructors affiliated with Ford: Lotus-Ford, McLaren-Ford, Matra-Ford.\",\n    \"Count the number of races each Ford-affiliated constructor won.\",\n    \"Check if the French Grand Prix was included among these wins.\",\n    \"The total number of races is 12.
