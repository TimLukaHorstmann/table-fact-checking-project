    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the game against New Orleans has the highest attendance\" is true or false, we need to analyze the attendance figures for each game listed in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Attendance Figures:**\n   - For each entry (game), extract the \"location attendance\" value.\n   - Extracted values:\n     - April 1, Houston: 18,422\n     - April 3, Sacramento: 18,422\n     - April 5, Dallas: 20,301\n     - April 8, New Orleans: 17,781\n     - April 10, Memphis: 15,908\n     - April 11, Minnesota: 18,478\n     - April 13, Memphis: 18,422\n     - April 15, Golden State: (attendance not specified)\n\n2. **Compare Attendance Figures:**\n   - Compare the extracted attendance figures to determine which is the highest.\n   - Highest attendance from available data:\n     - Dallas on April 5 has an attendance of 20,301.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the game against New Orleans (April 8) has the highest attendance with 17,781 attendees.\n   - However, based on our comparison, the highest recorded attendance is 20,301 for the Dallas game on April 5.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since 20,301 (Dallas) is greater than 17,781 (New Orleans), the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row index and column name for each relevant entry:\n  - Game against New Orleans: Row 3, Column \"location attendance\"\n  - Highest attendance game (Dallas): Row 2, Column \"location attendance\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Extract the 'location attendance' values from each row.\",\n    \"Identify the highest attendance value among all games.\",\n    \"Compare the highest attendance with the attendance of the game against New Orleans.\",\n    \"Determine if the claim matches the data.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
