    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, let's break down the information step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Claim\nThe claim states that \"the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' highest draft pick be from outside of Alabama.\" This implies we need to find the highest (i.e., earliest) pick number for a player drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and verify if this player is not from Alabama.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Table Structure\nThe table has columns: \"pick,\" \"round,\" \"player,\" \"position,\" and \"school.\" The data in the rows correspond to these columns, listing various players with their respective draft pick numbers, rounds, positions, schools, and implicitly drafted by a team (though not directly stated).\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Highest Draft Pick\nTo find the highest draft pick:\n- Look for the row with the smallest \"pick\" number. This represents the earliest selection in the draft.\n\nFrom the data provided:\n- Row 1 has pick number 6, which is the lowest (earliest) pick in this list.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the School of the Highest Pick\nCheck the school associated with this highest pick:\n- In Row 1, \"eric curry\" from Alabama is the player selected at pick number 6.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the Claim Against Findings\nThe claim requires that the highest draft pick for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers be from outside of Alabama. However:\n- The highest pick in the table (pick number 6) is indeed from Alabama (\"eric curry\" from \"alabama\").\n\n### Conclusion\nSince the earliest pick listed in the data is from Alabama, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cell for this determination is:\n- Row 1: {\"pick\": 6, \"school\": \"alabama\"}\n\nNow, let's put this into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the highest draft pick by finding the row with the smallest 'pick' number.
