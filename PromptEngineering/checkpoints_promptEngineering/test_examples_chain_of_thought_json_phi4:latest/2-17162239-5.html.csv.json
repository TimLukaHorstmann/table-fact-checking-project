    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, let's follow a step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: \n   - The claim states: \"the player in 3rd place be not 1 of the player from zimbabwe.\"\n   - This implies that the player ranked in 3rd place should not be from Zimbabwe.\n\n2. **Identify the Player in 3rd Place**:\n   - According to the table, we need to find the row where the \"place\" is \"3\". \n   - In the data provided, the third row corresponds to \"3\" under the \"place\" column.\n\n3. **Check the Details of the 3rd Place Player**:\n   - The relevant data for this player is:\n     - \"player\": \"nick price\"\n     - \"country\": \"zimbabwe\"\n     - This confirms that Nick Price, who is in 3rd place, is from Zimbabwe.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim Against the Data**:\n   - The claim states that the player in 3rd place should not be from Zimbabwe.\n   - However, we found that the player in 3rd place, Nick Price, is indeed from Zimbabwe.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the data contradicts the claim (the 3rd place player is from Zimbabwe), the claim is FALSE.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells to support this conclusion are those that provide information about the 3rd place player:\n     - Row index: 2 (since JSON arrays are zero-indexed, the third row corresponds to index 2)\n     - Columns: \"place\" and \"country\"\n\nHere is the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim states that the player in 3rd place should not be from Zimbabwe.\",\n    \"Identify the row where 'place' is '3'.\",\n    \"Check the 'country' for this row to see if it matches 'zimbabwe'.\",\n    \"Nick Price, who is in 3rd place, is from Zimbabwe.\",\n    \"The claim is contradicted by the data since the player in 3rd place is indeed from Zimbabwe.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
