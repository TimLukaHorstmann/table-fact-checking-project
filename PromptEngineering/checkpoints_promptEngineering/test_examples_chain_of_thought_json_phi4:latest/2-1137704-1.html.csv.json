    "resp": "To determine if the claim that there are three entrants with the Ferrari 038 3.5 V12 engine is true, we need to analyze the data provided.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Engine Specification**: We first focus on the engine column to find entries that specify \"Ferrari 038 3.5 V12\". This engine type needs to be matched exactly in our dataset to ensure accuracy.\n\n2. **Scan the Dataset**:\n   - We need to iterate over each row and check if the engine type matches \"ferrari 038 3.5 v12\".\n   - Given that some columns might contain variations in capitalization or whitespace, it is important to normalize these for comparison purposes (i.e., make everything lowercase).\n\n3. **Collect Relevant Entries**:\n   - For each entry where the engine type matches exactly after normalization, we record the row index and note the column details.\n  \n4. **Count Matches**: \n   - After identifying all matching entries, count them to see if there are exactly three.\n\n5. **Verify Claim**:\n   - If the number of matches is indeed three, then the claim is true. Otherwise, it is false.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n- From the dataset, look at the \"engine\" column:\n  - Row 13: `ferrari 038 3.5 v12`\n  - Row 14: `ferrari 038 3.5 v12`\n  - Row 15: `ferrari 038 3.5 v12`\n\n- We have exactly three entries matching the specified engine type.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that there are three entrants with the Ferrari 038 3.5 V12 engine is supported by the data in the dataset.\n\nHere's the JSON formatted output based on our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim, checked each row for 'ferrari 038 3.5 v12' in the engine column, normalizing text to lower case for accurate comparison. Found exactly three entries matching this specification: rows 13, 14, and 15.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"engine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"engine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"engine\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
