    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"tarso marque do not complete any lap\" is true or false, we need to examine the data in the provided table for the driver named \"Tarso Marques.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Driver:**\n   - We are looking for the row corresponding to the driver \"Tarso Marques.\"\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Row:**\n   - In the data, we find the entry:\n     ```json\n     [\n       \"tarso marques\",\n       \"minardi - ford\",\n       0,\n       \"spun off\",\n       21\n     ]\n     ```\n   - This is the last row in the table.\n\n3. **Check the 'laps' Column:**\n   - The value under the \"laps\" column for \"Tarso Marques\" is `0`.\n   - This indicates that Tarso Marques did not complete any laps.\n\n4. **Interpretation of Result:**\n   - Completing 0 laps means he did not finish any lap during the race.\n   - Therefore, the statement \"Tarso Marques do not complete any lap\" accurately reflects the data.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the table, the claim is true because Tarso Marques completed 0 laps.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The entry for 'Tarso Marques' shows that he completed 0 laps, confirming that he did not complete any lap.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Tarso Marques is true, we need to verify two key pieces of information from the table: \n\n1. **Grid Position**: We need to check if Tarso Marques started at grid position 13.\n2. **Laps Completed**: We need to confirm that he did not complete any laps.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n- **Step 1**: Locate the entry for \"tarso marques\" in the table. By scanning through the data, we find Tarso Marques listed at row index 20.\n  \n- **Step 2**: Check the \"grid\" column for Tarso Marques to verify his starting position on the grid:\n  - The value in the \"grid\" column for Tarso Marques is `21`. This indicates that he started from grid position 21, not 13.\n\n- **Step 3**: Check the \"laps\" column for Tarso Marques to see how many laps he completed:\n  - The value in the \"laps\" column for Tarso Marques is `0`. This confirms that he did not complete any laps.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states two things about Tarso Marques: starting on grid position 13 and completing no laps. Our examination shows:\n- He started at grid position 21, **not** 13.\n- He completed 0 laps, which aligns with the claim that he did not complete any laps.\n\nSince one part of the claim (starting from grid 13) is incorrect, the entire claim is false.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Tarso Marques started at grid position 21, as indicated in row index 20, column 'grid'. He completed 0 laps, confirming he did not complete any laps. The claim that he started on grid 13 is incorrect.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
