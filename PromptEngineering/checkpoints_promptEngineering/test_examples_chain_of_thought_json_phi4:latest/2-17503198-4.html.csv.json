However, the table does not explicitly mention any league names besides tournament rounds (e.g., UEFA Cup, Champions League). We will focus on finding matches with the specified aggregate score.\n\n2. **Identify Aggregate Scores**: Look for rows in the \"agg\" column that have a value of \"4 - 1\".\n\n3. **Examine Each Relevant Row**:\n   - **Row 5**: \n     - Columns: \n       - Round: \"first qualifying round\"\n       - Team 1: \"legia warszawa\"\n       - Agg: \"4 - 1\"\n       - Team 2: \"gomel\"\n       - First Leg: \"0 - 0\"\n       - Second Leg: \"4 - 1\"\n     - This match has an aggregate score of 4 - 1.\n\n   - **Row 6**:\n     - Columns:\n       - Round: \"first qualifying round\"\n       - Team 1: \"mtz - ripo minsk\"\n       - Agg: \"2 - 3\" (not relevant as it is not 4 - 1)\n   \n   - **Other Rows**: Check other rows for an aggregate score of 4 - 1:\n     - No other row has an aggregate score of 4 - 1.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: There is only one match in the table with an aggregate score of 4 - 1, which involves \"legia warszawa\" and \"gomel\".\n\n5. **League Context**: The table does not specify leagues for each match beyond tournament names (e.g., UEFA Cup). Therefore, we cannot confirm if any matches are specifically from the \"2008 Belarusian Premier League\".

Each row represents a match or a header for rounds of different tournaments (e.g., UEFA Intertoto Cup, UEFA Cup, UEFA Champions League).\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**: The claim is about matches in the 2008 Belarusian Premier League with an aggregate score (\"agg\") of 4 - 1. We need to search for rows where:\n   - The \"round\" column suggests a domestic league match (specifically from the Belarusian Premier League).\n   - The \"agg\" column shows \"4 - 1\".\n\n3. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - Rows with tournament names like \"2008 uefa intertoto cup\", \"2008 - 09 uefa cup\", and \"2008 - 09 uefa champions league\" can be ignored as they do not pertain to the Belarusian Premier League.\n   - Focus on rows where the \"round\" column might suggest a domestic league match.\n\n4. **Check for Domestic Matches**:\n   - The table does not explicitly mention any rounds from the 2008 Belarusian Premier League.
