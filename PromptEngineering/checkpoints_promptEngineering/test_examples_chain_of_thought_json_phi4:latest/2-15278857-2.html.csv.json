    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Dicky Bond have a lower average than John Hall\" is true or false, we need to compare their average goals per appearance (avge) from the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - Locate the rows for both Dicky Bond and John Hall in the data.\n   - Extract the 'avge' values for both players.\n\n2. **Extract Values:**\n   - **Dicky Bond:** \n     - Row Index: 12\n     - Average (avge): 0.20\n   - **John Hall:** \n     - Row Index: 10\n     - Average (avge): 0.15\n\n3. **Compare the Averages:**\n   - Dicky Bond's average is 0.20.\n   - John Hall's average is 0.15.\n\n4. **Determine the Relationship:**\n   - Compare the two averages:\n     - 0.20 (Dicky Bond) > 0.15 (John Hall)\n   - Since 0.20 is greater than 0.15, Dicky Bond has a higher average than John Hall.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that Dicky Bond have a lower average than John Hall.\n   - Based on the comparison, this claim is false because Dicky Bond actually has a higher average.\n\n### Final Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the rows for Dicky Bond and John Hall in the table.
