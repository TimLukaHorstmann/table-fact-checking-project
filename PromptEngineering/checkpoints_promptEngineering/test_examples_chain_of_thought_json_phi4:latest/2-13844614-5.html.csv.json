    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to evaluate each part of the claim against the data provided.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n1. **Every position has 5 matches:** This means that for all entries (rows) in the \"matches\" column, the value should be 5.\n2. **Only one of them won all of their matches:** This implies that only one entry in the \"wins\" column should have a value of 5.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Check if every position has 5 matches:**\n   - Look at the \"matches\" column for each row.\n   - Row 1: Matches = 5\n   - Row 2: Matches = 5\n   - Row 3: Matches = 5\n   - Row 4: Matches = 5\n   - Row 5: Matches = 5\n   - Row 6: Matches = 5\n\n   All rows have \"matches\" equal to 5, satisfying the first part of the claim.\n\n2. **Check if only one position won all their matches:**\n   - Look at the \"wins\" column for each row.\n   - Row 1: Wins = 5\n   - Row 2: Wins = 4\n   - Row 3: Wins = 3\n   - Row 4: Wins = 2\n   - Row 5: Wins = 1\n   - Row 6: Wins = 0\n\n   Only Row 1 has \"wins\" equal to 5, and no other row does.
