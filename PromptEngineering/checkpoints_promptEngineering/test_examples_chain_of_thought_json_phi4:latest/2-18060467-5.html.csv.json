    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"4 players from the US have a to par score of -5\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Column for Country:**\n   - The column that lists the player's country is labeled as \"country.\"\n\n2. **Identify the Column for To Par Score:**\n   - The column that shows the to par score is labeled as \"to par.\"\n\n3. **Search for Players with a To Par Score of -5:**\n   - We need to find all entries where the \"to par\" value is \"- 5\".\n\n4. **Check Country for Each Player with To Par Score of -5:**\n   - For each player identified in step 3, check their corresponding entry in the \"country\" column.\n\n5. **Count the Number of US Players:**\n   - Count how many of these players are from the United States (i.e., have \"united states\" as their country).\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Row 4:** \n  - Player: Fred Couples\n  - Country: United States\n  - To Par: \"- 5\"\n  - This is one US player with a to par score of -5.\n\n- **Row 5:** \n  - Player: David Tapping\n  - Country: England\n  - To Par: \"- 5\"\n  - This player is not from the United States.\n\nFrom the table, only Fred Couples from the United States has a to par score of -5. There are no other US players with this score.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that there are \"4 players from the us have a to par score of - 5.\" However, based on our analysis, only one player (Fred Couples) meets these criteria.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified rows with 'to par' score of '- 5'.
