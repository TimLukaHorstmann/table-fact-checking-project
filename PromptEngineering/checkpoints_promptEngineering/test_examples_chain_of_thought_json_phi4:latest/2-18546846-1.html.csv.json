    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the 49ers play the los angeles dones 1 time in the 1947 season\" is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Data**: We are interested in identifying all games played against the \"los angeles dons\" during the 1947 season.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**: Look through each row of the data and check for entries where the opponent is listed as \"los angeles dons\".\n\n3. **Count the Occurrences**:\n   - Find how many times the \"los angeles dons\" appear in the \"opponent\" column.\n   - Verify that these appearances are unique to different weeks.\n\n4. **Verify the Result**: Confirm if there is exactly one game against the \"los angeles dons\".\n\nNow, let's apply this reasoning:\n\n- **Row 2**: The opponent is \"los angeles dons\", and it occurs on September 7, 1947.\n- **Row 9**: Again, the opponent is \"los angeles dons\", and it occurs on November 2, 1947.\n\nThe \"los angeles dons\" appear twice in the table:\n\n- Once in Week 2 with a result of \"w\" (win) against them.\n- Once in Week 9 with a result of \"w\" (win) again.\n\nThus, the claim that they played only once is incorrect.
