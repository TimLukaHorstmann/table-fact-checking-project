    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Kevin Nickerson is true, we need to verify two pieces of information from the table: his total yards (\"yards\") and his longest run (\"long\"). Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Kevin Nickerson's Data Row**:  \n   - Scan through the \"data\" array to find the entry for \"kevin nickerson\". This is done by comparing each player name in the first column of the data.\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Columns**:\n   - Once we identify the row corresponding to Kevin Nickerson, we need to check the values in the \"yards\" and \"long\" columns.\n   \n3. **Check the Claimed Values**:\n   - According to the claim, Kevin Nickerson has \"73 yards\" and a \"long run of 8\".\n   - We will compare these claimed values with the actual data from the table.\n\n4. **Extract Data for Verification**:\n   - From the row corresponding to Kevin Nickerson, extract the value in the \"yards\" column.\n   - Extract the value in the \"long\" column.\n\n5. **Compare and Conclude**:\n   - The claim states that Kevin Nickerson has 73 yards, which matches the table's data for him.\n   - However, the claim states his longest run is 8, whereas the table shows it as 9.\n   - Since one part of the claim (the \"long\" value) does not match the table, the entire claim is false.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells are those that correspond to Kevin Nickerson's total yards and longest run in the data array.\n\nLet's summarize this reasoning into a JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate Kevin Nickerson's row in the table.
