McMillan had 7 high assists.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The team with a record of \"34 - 27\" is indeed associated with N. McMillan having 7 high assists in this game.\n   - Therefore, the claim is TRUE based on the data provided.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the row with the record '34 - 27'.

This is found in row index 6.\n   - According to this row, G Payton had 5 high assists on that date.\n\n3. **Count Total High Assists for G Payton**:\n   - We need to check all games where G Payton achieved a high assist record and count the total number of such occurrences.\n   \n4. **Iterate Over All Rows in \"high assists\" Column**:\n   - Row 2: Game on March 3, G Payton had 9 high assists.\n   - Row 5: Game on March 8, G Payton had 7 high assists.\n   - Row 6: Game on March 10, G Payton had 5 high assists.\n   - Row 11: Game on March 17, G Payton had 8 high assists.\n   - Row 19: Game on March 24, G Payton had 7 high assists.\n\n5. **Calculate Total High Assists**:\n   - Count the number of games where G Payton's name appears in the \"high assists\" column:\n     - March 3 (9 assists)\n     - March 8 (7 assists)\n     - March 10 (5 assists)\n     - March 17 (8 assists)\n     - March 24 (7 assists)\n\n   Total occurrences: 5 times\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that G Payton had a total of 8 high assist games, and specifically mentions March 10 as one of these.\n   - We found that G Payton had high assists in 5 different games, not 8.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is FALSE because G Payton did not have 8 games with high assists; he only achieved this record 5 times.
