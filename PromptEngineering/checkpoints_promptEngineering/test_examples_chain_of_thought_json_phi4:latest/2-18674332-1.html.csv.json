    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about November 19, 1978, being the game with the highest attendance is true or false, we need to analyze the \"attendance\" data from the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim**: The claim states that the game on November 19, 1978, had the highest attendance.\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Data**:\n   - Find the row corresponding to November 19, 1978.\n   - Extract the \"attendance\" value for this date: 45,022.\n\n3. **Compare with Other Games**:\n   - Review the \"attendance\" values for all other games listed in the table.\n   - List of attendance figures from each game:\n     - September 3, 1978: 68,973\n     - September 10, 1978: 49,502\n     - September 17, 1978: 46,161\n     - September 24, 1978: 71,536\n     - October 1, 1978: 41,107\n     - October 8, 1978: 59,337\n     - October 15, 1978: 37,671\n     - October 22, 1978: 44,235\n     - October 29, 1978: 53,706\n     - November 5, 1978: 55,468\n     - November 12, 1978: 33,155\n     - December 3, 1978: 51,657\n     - December 10, 1978: 30,931\n     - December 17, 1978: 56,674\n\n4. **Determine the Highest Attendance**:\n   - Compare all attendance figures.\n   - The highest attendance figure is 71,536 for September 24, 1978.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the highest attendance (71,536) occurred on September 24, 1978, and not on November 19, 1978, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row corresponding to November 19, 1978: Attendance = 45,022\n- Row corresponding to September 24, 1978 (highest attendance): Attendance = 71,536\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that the game on November 19, 1978, had the highest attendance.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the game with an attendance of 30931 take place before the game with an attendance of 50068\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the relevant data from the table.\n\n1. **Identify the game with an attendance of 30931:**\n   - Look through the \"attendance\" column in each row.\n   - Find the entry where the attendance is 30931.\n\n2. **Identify the game with an attendance of 50068:**\n   - Similarly, look through the \"attendance\" column for the entry with 50068.\n\n3. **Determine their positions:**\n   - Note the index (row number) of each identified entry.\n   - Check if the row index for the attendance of 30931 is less than that for the attendance of 50068.\n\n4. **Conclusion based on position:**\n   - If the row index for 30931 is indeed less, then the game with an attendance of 30931 took place before the one with 50068, making the claim TRUE.\n   - Otherwise, it would be FALSE.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the data:\n\n- **Step 1:** Scan through the \"attendance\" column:\n  - Row 15 has an attendance of 30931 (date: December 10, 1978).\n  - Row 14 has an attendance of 50068 (date: December 3, 1978).\n\n- **Step 2:** Compare their row indices:\n  - Row 15 (attendance = 30931) comes after Row 14 (attendance = 50068).\n\nThus, the game with an attendance of 30931 took place after the game with an attendance of 50068.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the row with an attendance of 30931, which is row 15.
