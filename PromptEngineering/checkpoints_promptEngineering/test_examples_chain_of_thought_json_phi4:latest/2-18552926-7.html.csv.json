    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"Gillian Anderson was nominated for 4 awards\" is true or false, we will analyze the table data step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Entries:**\n   - We need to find entries in the table where Gillian Anderson is listed as a recipient or nominee.\n   - Look specifically at rows where \"gillian anderson\" appears under the \"recipients and nominees\" column since this indicates she was considered for an award.\n\n2. **Filter by Result:**\n   - From these identified entries, we need to focus on those where the \"result\" is \"nominated.\"\n\n3. **Count Nominations:**\n   - Count how many times Gillian Anderson appears with a result of \"nominated.\"\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **1995 Entry:**  \n  - Column: Recipients and Nominees = \"gillian anderson\"\n  - Role / Episode: \"dana scully\"\n  - Result: \"nominated\"  \n  - This counts as 1 nomination.\n\n- **1996 Entry:**  \n  - Column: Recipients and Nominees = \"gillian anderson\"\n  - Role / Episode: \"gillian anderson\"\n  - Result: \"won\"  \n  - This is not a nomination, so it doesn't count towards the claim.\n\n- **1997 Entry:**  \n  - Column: Recipients and Nominees = \"gillian anderson\"\n  - Role / Episode: \"gillian anderson\"\n  - Result: \"nominated\"  \n  - This counts as another nomination (2 total).\n\n- **1998 Entry:**  \n  - Column: Recipients and Nominees = \"gillian anderson\"\n  - Role / Episode: \"gillian anderson\"\n  - Result: \"nominated\"  \n  - This is a third nomination (3 total).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGillian Anderson was nominated for awards in the years 1995, 1997, and 1998 based on her role as Dana Scully. She received nominations three times according to the table.\n\nThus, the claim that Gillian Anderson was nominated for 4 awards is **FALSE**.\n\n### Final Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified entries where 'gillian anderson' appeared in the 'recipients and nominees' column.
