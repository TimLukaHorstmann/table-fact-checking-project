It reads \"fly-half\".\n\n- **Date of Birth Verification:**\n  - Check the \"date of birth (age)\" column.

We need to locate this player in the table.\n\n2. **Check Position and Club**:\n   - Verify if this player's position is \"fly-half\".\n   - Confirm the club/province for this player is \"Sale\".\n\n3. **Verify Uniqueness**: Ensure that no other player from Sale has a position of \"fly-half\".\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Player\n- Search for the row with \"date of birth\" as \"2 November 1987\".\n- We find the player \"danny cipriani\" at row index 22.\n\n### Step 2: Check Position and Club\n- For \"danny cipriani\":\n  - Position is \"fly-half\".\n  - Club/Province is \"wasps\", not \"Sale\".\n\n### Step 3: Verify Uniqueness for Sale\n- Since \"danny cipriani\" is from \"wasps\", he does not fulfill the condition of being a \"fly-half\" from \"Sale\".\n- Check all players with the club/province as \"Sale\":\n  - \"charlie hodgson\" (row index 23) is listed under \"Sale\" and has the position \"fly-half\".\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim states that the player born on \"2 November 1987\" should be a \"fly-half\" for \"Sale\".
