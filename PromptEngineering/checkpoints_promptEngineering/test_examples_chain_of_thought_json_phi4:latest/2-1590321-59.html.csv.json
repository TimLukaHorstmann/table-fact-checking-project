    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Titus Ozon scoring 157 goals while being active from 1947 to 1964 is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify two key pieces of information: his years of activity and the number of goals he scored.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Titus Ozon in the Data:**\n   - We look for the entry where the name \"Titus Ozon\" appears in the table. From the data, we see:\n     ```json\n     [\n       10,\n       \"titus ozon\",\n       \"1947 - 1964\",\n       270,\n       157\n     ]\n     ```\n\n2. **Check the Years of Activity:**\n   - The column labeled \"years\" contains the period during which Titus Ozon was active.\n   - For Titus Ozon, this value is \"1947 - 1964\".\n\n3. **Verify the Number of Goals Scored:**\n   - The column labeled \"goals\" indicates how many goals he scored.\n   - For Titus Ozon, this value is 157.\n\n4. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Titus Ozon was active from \"1947 - 1964\" and scored \"157 goals\".\n   - Both pieces of information match the data we extracted for Titus Ozon.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The years of activity (\"1947 - 1964\") and the number of goals (157) in the table exactly match those mentioned in the claim.\n- Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells from the table are:\n- Row index: 9\n- Column \"name\": \"titus ozon\"\n- Column \"years\": \"1947 - 1964\"\n- Column \"goals\": 157\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate Titus Ozon in the data. Check his 'years' of activity and compare it to the claim's period ('1947 - 1964'). Then verify the number of goals scored (157) as stated in the claim.
