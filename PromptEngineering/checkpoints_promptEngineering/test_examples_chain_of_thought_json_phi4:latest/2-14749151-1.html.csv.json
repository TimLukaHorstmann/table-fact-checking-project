    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"mtz - ripo be 1 of 2 team with venue atlant\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table data for any teams with a venue named \"atlant\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The column that contains venue information is labeled as \"venue\".\n   \n2. **Examine Each Row in the Venue Column**:\n   - We will go through each row and check the value in the \"venue\" column to see if it matches \"atlant\".\n\n3. **Check for \"atlant\" Venue**:\n   - Look at each entry under the \"venue\" column to find teams with \"atlant\".\n   \n4. **List Teams with \"atlant\" as Venue**:\n   - Find all entries where the venue is \"atlant\" and list their corresponding team names.\n\n5. **Count the Number of Teams with \"atlant\"**:\n   - Count how many teams have \"atlant\" listed as their venue.\n\n6. **Verify mtz - ripo's Venue**:\n   - Check if \"mtz - ripo\" is one of these teams.\n\n7. **Determine Total Teams with \"atlant\" Venue**:\n   - Confirm the total number of teams with \"atlant\" as a venue to see if it matches the claim (i.e., 2 teams).\n\n### Detailed Examination:\n\n- **Row 1**: Venue is \"central , gomel\"\n- **Row 2**: Venue is \"city stadium , borisov\"\n- **Row 3**: Venue is \"dinamo , minsk\"\n- **Row 4**: Venue is \"torpedo , minsk\"\n- **Row 5**: Venue is \"stroitel\"\n- **Row 6**: Venue is \"torpedo , zhodino\"\n- **Row 7**: Venue is \"neman\"\n- **Row 8**: Venue is \"atlant\" (Team: naftan)\n- **Row 9**: Venue is \"spartak , mogilev\"\n- **Row 10**: Venue is \"spartak , bobruisk\"\n- **Row 11**: Venue is \"osk brestskiy\"\n- **Row 12**: Venue is \"traktor\"\n- **Row 13**: Venue is \"darida\"\n- **Row 14**: Venue is \"yunost\"\n- **Row 15**: Venue is \"central , vitebsk\"\n- **Row 16**: Venue is \"traktor\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The team \"naftan\" has the venue \"atlant\".\n- There are no other teams listed with \"atlant\" as their venue.\n- \"mtz - ripo\" does not have \"atlant\" as its venue.\n\nSince there is only one team (\"naftan\") with the venue \"atlant\", the claim that \"mtz - ripo be 1 of 2 team with venue atlant\" is FALSE.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the relevant column for venues.\",\n    \"Examine each row in the 'venue' column to find entries matching 'atlant'.\",\n    \"List teams associated with the 'atlant' venue.\",\n    \"Count the total number of teams with 'atlant' as their venue.\",\n    \"Verify if 'mtz - ripo' is one of these teams.\",\n    \"Determine the total count and check against the claim (2 teams).\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
