Therefore, this part of the claim is false.\n\n2. **Verify Friedman's Attendance:**\n   - Locate the row for \"quarterback\" where Benny Friedman is listed.\n   - Check his corresponding \"school\" column entry.\n\n   From the table:\n   - Row 5 (for \"quarterback\"):\n     - Name: \"benny friedman\"\n     - School: \"michigan\"\n\n   Conclusion: Benny Friedman attended Michigan, not Stanford. Therefore, this part of the claim is false.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nBoth parts of the claim are incorrect based on the data provided in the table. Thus, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\n#### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n\n- For Weir and Chase:\n  - Row 2, Column \"school\": \"nebraska pittsburgh\"\n\n- For Benny Friedman:\n  - Row 5, Column \"school\": \"michigan\"\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We checked the 'tackles' row for Weir and Chase's schools; they attended Nebraska and Pittsburgh.
