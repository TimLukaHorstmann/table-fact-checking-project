We need to locate this match within the data.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Match:**\n   - In the table, the first row contains:\n     - Home Team: North Melbourne\n     - Home Team Score: 5.12 (42)\n     - Away Team: Richmond\n     - Away Team Score: 3.8 (26)\n\n3. **Determine the Crowd Size for the Match:**\n   - From the same row, we find that the crowd size is 9000.\n\n4. **Compare with the Claimed Crowd Size:**\n   - The claim states that the crowd was larger than 23135.\n   - Since the actual crowd size for this match (9000) is not larger than 23135, the claim does not hold true.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is false because the crowd size of 9000 for the identified match is less than 23135.
