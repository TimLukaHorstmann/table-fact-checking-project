    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"in 1975, the Denver Broncos never have more than 2 wins in a row\" is true or false based on the given table, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Winning Games**: First, identify which games resulted in a win for the Denver Broncos. The result column shows whether each game was won ('w') or lost ('l').\n\n2. **Track Consecutive Wins**: We need to count consecutive wins and check if there are any instances of more than two consecutive wins.\n\n3. **Analyze the Data**:\n   - **Game 1 (Sep 21)**: Win against Kansas City Chiefs.\n   - **Game 2 (Sep 29)**: Win against Green Bay Packers.\n   - **Game 3 (Oct 5)**: Loss to Buffalo Bills.\n     - Two consecutive wins at this point (Games 1 and 2).\n   - **Game 4 (Oct 12)**: Loss to Pittsburgh Steelers.\n   - **Game 5 (Oct 19)**: Win against Cleveland Browns.\n   - **Game 6 (Oct 26)**: Loss to Kansas City Chiefs.\n   - **Game 7 (Nov 26)**: Loss to Oakland Raiders.\n   - **Game 8 (Nov 9)**: Loss to Cincinnati Bengals.\n     - One win between Games 4 and 6.\n   - **Game 9 (Nov 16)**: Win against San Diego Chargers.\n   - **Game 10 (Nov 23)**: Loss to Atlanta Falcons.\n   - **Game 11 (Nov 30)**: Win against San Diego Chargers.\n     - Two consecutive wins at this point (Games 9 and 11).\n   - **Game 12 (Dec 8)**: Loss to Oakland Raiders.\n   - **Game 13 (Dec 14)**: Win against Philadelphia Eagles.\n   - **Game 14 (Dec 20)**: Loss to Miami Dolphins.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The longest streak of consecutive wins in the data is two games (Games 1 and 2, and Games 9 and 11).

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"in 1975, the most points the Denver Broncos scored in a loss was 15\" is true or false, we need to analyze the data provided in the table for games that were losses (indicated by 'L' in the \"result\" column) and extract the points the Denver Broncos scored in those games.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Losses:**\n   - We will focus on rows where the \"result\" column indicates a loss ('l') for the Denver Broncos.\n   \n2. **Extract Points Scored by Denver Broncos:**\n   - For each loss, we need to extract the points scored by the Denver Broncos from the \"result\" column. The format is \"DenverBroncosPoints - OpponentPoints\".\n\n3. **Compare Points in Losses:**\n   - We will compare the points scored by the Denver Broncos in these losses to determine if any score exceeds 15.\n\n4. **List of Relevant Rows and Columns:**\n   - For each relevant row, extract:\n     - The \"row_index\" for reference.\n     - The \"result\" column value to identify the points scored in that game.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - Check if any loss had the Broncos scoring more than 15 points. If not, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Row 3:** \n  - Result: \"l 14 - 38\"\n  - Points scored by Denver Broncos: 14\n\n- **Row 4:** \n  - Result: \"l 9 - 20\"\n  - Points scored by Denver Broncos: 9\n\n- **Row 6:** \n  - Result: \"l 13 - 26\"\n  - Points scored by Denver Broncos: 13\n\n- **Row 7:** \n  - Result: \"l 17 - 42\"\n  - Points scored by Denver Broncos: 17\n\n- **Row 8:** \n  - Result: \"l 16 - 17\"\n  - Points scored by Denver Broncos: 16\n\n- **Row 10:** \n  - Result: \"l 21 - 35\"\n  - Points scored by Denver Broncos: 21\n\n- **Row 12:** \n  - Result: \"l 10 - 17\"\n  - Points scored by Denver Broncos: 10\n\n- **Row 14:** \n  - Result: \"l 13 - 14\"\n  - Points scored by Denver Broncos: 13\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nIn the losses, the points scored by the Denver Broncos were 14, 9, 13, 17, 16, 21, 10, and 13.
