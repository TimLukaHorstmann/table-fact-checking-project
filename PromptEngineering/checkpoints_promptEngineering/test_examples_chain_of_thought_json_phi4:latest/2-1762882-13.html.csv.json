The claim states that Scotland plays 5 times more often at Easter Road than at Hampden Park during the Scottish football season. Let's go through this step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the venue names in the dataset:**\n   - \"Hampden Park, Glasgow\" is mentioned multiple times.\n   - \"Easter Road, Edinburgh\" appears once.\n\n2. **Count the number of matches played at each venue:**\n\n   a. **For Hampden Park, Glasgow**:\n      - Review each row to count occurrences where \"venue\" is \"hampden park , glasgow (h)\".\n      - Rows with relevant data are:\n        1. Row index 1: Date = \"6 September\", Venue = \"Hampden Park, Glasgow\"\n        2. Row index 3: Date = \"11 October\", Venue = \"Hampden Park, Glasgow\"\n        3.
