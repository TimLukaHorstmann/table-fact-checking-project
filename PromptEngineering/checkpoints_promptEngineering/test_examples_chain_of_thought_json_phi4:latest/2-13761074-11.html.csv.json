    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"attendance reached 20000 in every one of the Cavaliers' games\" is true or false, we need to analyze the attendance numbers for all games where Cleveland was either the home team (the \"home\" column indicates 'cleveland') or the visitor (\"visitor\" column contains 'cleveland'). Here's how I will approach this:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify All Cavaliers' Games:**\n   - We need to find every row in which Cleveland is either playing at home or away.\n\n2. **Check Attendance for Each Game:**\n   - For each identified game, check the value in the \"attendance\" column.\n   - Verify if this attendance number is 20,000 or higher.\n\n3. **Evaluate Each Relevant Row:**\n\n   - **March 1:** Visitor = Cleveland; Attendance = 20428 (>=20000)\n   - **March 3:** Home = Cleveland; Attendance = 20562 (>=20000)\n   - **March 5:** Home = Cleveland; Attendance = 20562 (>=20000)\n   - **March 7:** Visitor = Cleveland; Attendance = 22076 (>=20000)\n   - **March 10:** Visitor = Cleveland; Attendance = 18081 (<20000)\n   - **March 11:** Home = Cleveland; Attendance = 20562 (>=20000)\n   - **March 13:** Home = Cleveland; Attendance = 20562 (>=20000)\n   - **March 14:** Visitor = Cleveland; Attendance = 14561 (<20000)\n   - **March 17:** Home = Cleveland; Attendance = 20562 (>=20000)\n   - **March 20:** Visitor = Cleveland; Attendance = 17043 (<20000)\n   - **March 21:** Home = Cleveland; Attendance = 20562 (>=20000)\n   - **March 23:** Home = Cleveland; Attendance = 20562 (>=20000)\n   - **March 25:** Home = Cleveland; Attendance = 20562 (>=20000)\n   - **March 27:** Visitor = Cleveland; Attendance = 14024 (<20000)\n   - **March 28:** Visitor = Cleveland; Attendance = 19763 (<20000)\n   - **March 31:** Visitor = Cleveland; Attendance = 22960 (>=20000)\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The games where attendance was below 20,000 are on March 10, March 14, March 20, March 27, and March 28.\n   - Therefore, the claim that attendance reached 20,000 in every Cavaliers' game is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- **Row Index: 4** (March 10), Attendance = 18081\n- **Row Index: 7** (March 14), Attendance = 14561\n- **Row Index: 9** (March 20), Attendance = 17043\n- **Row Index: 13** (March 27), Attendance = 14024\n- **Row Index: 14** (March 28), Attendance = 19763\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify all games involving Cleveland as either the visitor or home team.\",\n    \"Check attendance for each identified game to see if it is 20,000 or higher.\",\n    \"Games on March 10, March 14, March 20, March 27, and March 28 had attendances below 20,000.\",\n    \"Therefore, not all Cavaliers' games reached an attendance of 20,000.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
