Family Guy episodes as Wellesley Wild is true, we need to analyze the given table for information regarding directors and writers of these specific episodes.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - We need to look at the \"directed by\" column to find out who directed each Road to... Family Guy episode.\n   - Also, examine the \"written by\" column to determine who wrote these episodes.\n\n2. **List Episodes Directed by Patrick Meighan:**\n   - Go through each row and check the \"directed by\" field for entries listing Patrick Meighan as the director:\n     - Row 3: Directed by Dan Povenmire (not Patrick Meighan).\n     - Row 4: Directed by Greg Colton (not Patrick Meighan).\n     - Therefore, Patrick Meighan does not direct any episodes.\n\n3. **List Episodes Written by Wellesley Wild:**\n   - Go through each row and check the \"written by\" field for entries listing Wellesley Wild as the writer:\n     - Row 5: Written by Wellesley Wild (Road to the Multiverse).\n     - Therefore, Wellesley Wild writes exactly one episode.\n\n4. **Compare Counts:**\n   - Patrick Meighan directed 0 episodes.\n   - Wellesley Wild wrote 1 episode.\n   - Since 0 is not equal to 1, Patrick Meighan does not direct as many Road to... Family Guy episodes as Wellesley Wild writes.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Patrick Meighan directs zero episodes, while Wellesley Wild writes one.

However, it is not a broad geographic category like a country or continent.\n   - **Row 4**: \"Germany\" is a country.\n   - **Row 5**: \"The multiverse\" does not correspond to any real-world geographic location; it's more of a conceptual space used in science fiction and fantasy.\n   - **Row 6**: \"North Pole\" refers to a specific point on Earth, often considered within polar regions rather than a country or continent.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that all episodes have a location with a different geographic category mentioned in the title.\n   - While most titles refer to recognizable geographic categories (e.g., state, continent, country), \"road to rupert\" and \"road to the multiverse\" do not fit this criterion as they are either specific towns or conceptual places.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since two of the episodes (\"road to rupert\" and \"road to the multiverse\") do not include a geographic category in their titles, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The episode titles were analyzed for geographic categories.
