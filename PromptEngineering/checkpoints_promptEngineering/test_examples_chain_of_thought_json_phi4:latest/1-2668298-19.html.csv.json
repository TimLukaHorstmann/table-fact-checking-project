The claim holds for this row.\n   - **North Carolina 4:** Incumbent William S Blackledge retired. Therefore, the incumbent did not get re-elected; the claim does not hold here.\n   - **North Carolina 5:** Incumbent Charles Hooks is \"re-elected\".

Therefore, he was not re-elected; the claim does not hold here.\n   - **North Carolina 9:** Incumbent Romulus M Saunders is \"re-elected\" with 100% of the vote. The claim holds for this row.\n   - **North Carolina 10:** Incumbent John Long is \"re-elected\".
