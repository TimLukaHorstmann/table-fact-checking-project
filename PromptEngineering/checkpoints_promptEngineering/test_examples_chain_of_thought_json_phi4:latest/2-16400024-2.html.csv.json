It is listed as \"1.75 v\".\n\n3. **Compare the Voltages**:\n   - Pentium III 500E has a voltage of \"1.7 v\".\n   - Pentium III 1100 has a voltage of \"1.75 v\".\n   - Compare these two values: 1.7 v is less than 1.75 v.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The statement claims that the Pentium III 500E has a higher voltage than the Pentium III 1100.\n   - Since 1.7 v is not greater than 1.75 v, the statement is false.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - For Pentium III 500E: Row index 2, Column name `voltage`.\n   - For Pentium III 1100: Row index 21, Column name `voltage`.\n\n### Final Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row for 'pentiumiii500e' and find its voltage as '1.7 v'.\",\n    \"Identify the row for 'pentiumiii1100' and find its voltage as '1.75 v'.\",\n    \"Compare the voltages: 1.7 v is less than 1.75 v.\",\n    \"The statement claims a higher voltage for Pentium III 500E, which is incorrect.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"voltage\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"voltage\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
