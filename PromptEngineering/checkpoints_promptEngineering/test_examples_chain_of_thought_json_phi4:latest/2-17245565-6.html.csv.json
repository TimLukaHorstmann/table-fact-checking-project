Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Understand \"Under Par\":** In golf, a score that is \"under par\" means the player has taken fewer strokes than the set par for the course. This would be indicated by a negative number in the \"to par\" column.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data:** Look at each row in the table and examine the values in the \"to par\" column to see which players have scores under par (negative values).\n\n3. **Count Players Under Par:**\n   - Row 1: Jim Simons has a score of \"-3,\" indicating he is 3 strokes under par.\n   - Row 2: Jack Nicklaus has a score of \"-1,\" indicating he is 1 stroke under par.\n   - Row 3 and subsequent rows all have scores that are either even (\"e\") or positive, indicating they are at par or over par.\n\n4. **Determine the Number of Players Under Par:** \n   - From the analysis above, we find two players with negative \"to par\" scores: Jim Simons and Jack Nicklaus.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:** The claim states that more than 2 players scored under par.
