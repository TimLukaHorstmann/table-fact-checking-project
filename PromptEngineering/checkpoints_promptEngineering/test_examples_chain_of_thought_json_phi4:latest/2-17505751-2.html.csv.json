However, the table shows they are both from France (\"fra\").\n\n5. **Timeframe Consideration:**\n   - The claim refers to the 2008-09 season.\n   - Faubert's transfer ends in \"winter\" of 2009, which is consistent with being part of a team during the 2008-09 season.\n   - Lass's transfer window is \"winter\" and ends in 2013. The claim doesn't specify his involvement during the 2008-09 season, but since he is not from Italy, this point is moot.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim that both Lass and Faubert were from Italy is FALSE because they are both listed as being from France according to the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified players 'Lass' and 'Faubert' in the table.
