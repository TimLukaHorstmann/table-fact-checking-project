Therefore, we need to check if the result for the mentioned project in that year was a nomination.\n\nNow, let's systematically analyze these points using the table:\n\n- **Search for the Year 1995**:\n  - In the data array, look for an entry where \"year\" is 1995.\n\n- **Locate Project \"Bulworth\"**:\n  - Within the 1995 row (if it exists), check if the project name matches \"Bulworth.\"\n\n- **Verify the Result as Nominated**:\n  - If we find \"Bulworth,\" confirm that its result is listed as \"nominated.\"\n\nLet's go through these steps with the data:\n\n1. In the table, identify entries by looking at each row for the year column:\n\n   - Row index 2: Year is 1995, Director is \"Mike Nichols\", Project is \"Wolf\", Category is \"Best Original Score\", Result is \"Nominated\".\n   - The other rows do not mention the year 1995.\n\n2.

Since there's no entry for \"Bulworth\" in 1995, it means that the claim cannot be true regarding a nomination for this specific film and year combination.\n\nConclusively, the statement \"in 1995 bulworth be[nominate]\" is FALSE because \"Bulworth\" was not nominated in 1995; instead, it was directed by Warren Beatty and appeared with a nomination in the year 1999.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim refers to a project 'Bulworth' being nominated in 1995.
