In these races, if such an entry exists, verify if \"Platinum Scissors\" appears in the \"winner / 2nd\" column as a second-place finisher.\n\nLet's go through the table step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Entries with Time \"1:44:30\"\nWe need to check each row of the data for an entry where the time matches \"1:44.30\". Note that in the table, times are given without colons separating minutes and seconds (e.g., \"1:36.85\" instead of \"1:36:85\"). Therefore, we should look for \"1443.0\".\n\n- Row 0: Time is \"1:03.53\"\n- Row 1: Time is \"1:21.85\"\n- Row 2: Time is \"1:36.30\"\n- Row 3: Time is \"1:38.31\"\n- Row 4: Time is \"2:00.60\"\n- Row 5: Time is \"2:06.27\"\n- Row 6: Time is \"2:02.64\"\n- Row 7: Time is \"1:10.66\"\n- Row 8: Time is \"1:22.49\"\n- Row 9: Time is \"1:37.93\"\n- Row 10: Time is \"1:30.71\"\n- Row 11: Time is \"1:36.85\"\n\nNone of the entries have a time of \"1443.0\" (or \"1:44.30\").\n\n### Step 2: Verify if \"Platinum Scissors\" appears as \"2nd\"\nSince we did not find any entry with the specified time, this step is unnecessary. However, for completeness:\n\n- Row 2 has \"2nd - platinum scissors\" but the time is \"1:36.30\".\n\n### Conclusion\nThere is no race in the table where the time is \"1:44.30\".
