    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the total score for the away team across all matches is true, we need to perform a detailed analysis using the provided table data.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the total score for the away teams in 6 matches is 396 points.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Data:**\n   - We need to extract the \"away team score\" from each row of the data section, as this column contains scores specifically for the away teams.\n   \n3. **Convert Scores to Points:**\n   - The format of the scores in the table is given as \"X.Y\", where:\n     - `X` represents full-time goals (worth 6 points each).\n     - `Y` represents behinds (worth 1 point each).\n\n4. **Calculate Points for Each Match:**\n   - Convert the score from the format \"X.Y\" to total points using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Points} = (\\text{Full-time Goals} \\times 6) + \\text{Behinds}\n     \\]\n   \n5. **Perform Calculations:**\n   - For each match, calculate the away team's score in points:\n     - Match 1 (St Kilda): \"6.11\" -> \\( (6 \\times 6) + 11 = 36 + 11 = 47 \\)\n     - Match 2 (Melbourne): \"12.12\" -> \\( (12 \\times 6) + 12 = 72 + 12 = 84 \\)\n     - Match 3 (Essendon): \"7.10\" -> \\( (7 \\times 6) + 10 = 42 + 10 = 52 \\)\n     - Match 4 (Fitzroy): \"12.13\" -> \\( (12 \\times 6) + 13 = 72 + 13 = 85 \\)\n     - Match 5 (North Melbourne): \"6.6\" -> \\( (6 \\times 6) + 6 = 36 + 6 = 42 \\)\n     - Match 6 (Footscray): \"13.15\" -> \\( (13 \\times 6) + 15 = 78 + 15 = 93 \\)\n\n6. **Sum the Points:**\n   - Add up all the calculated points from each match:\n     - Total = 47 + 84 + 52 + 85 + 42 + 93 = 403\n\n7. **Compare with Claimed Total:**\n   - The calculated total score for the away teams is 403, not 396 as claimed.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since 403 does not equal 396, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The scores of the away teams in each match are converted from 'X.Y' format to total points using the formula (6 * X) + Y.
