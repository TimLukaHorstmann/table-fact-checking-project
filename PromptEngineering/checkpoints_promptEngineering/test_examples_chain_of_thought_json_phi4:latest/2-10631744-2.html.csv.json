    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Haskell Noyes was coach more than fifty years before Steve Yoder\" is true or false, we need to analyze the coaching periods for both Haskell Noyes and Steve Yoder as specified in the table.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Haskell Noyes' Coaching Period:**\n   - Look at the row corresponding to \"haskell noyes\".\n   - The data indicates that he coached from 1908 to 1911.\n   - This is a period of 3 years (1908, 1909, 1910, and part of 1911).\n\n2. **Identify Steve Yoder's Coaching Period:**\n   - Look at the row corresponding to \"steve yoder\".\n   - The data indicates that he coached from 1982 to 1992.\n   - This is a period of 11 years (1982 through 1992).\n\n3. **Calculate the Time Difference Between Their Coaching Periods:**\n   - Determine the end year for Haskell Noyes and the start year for Steve Yoder.\n   - Haskell Noyes' coaching ended in 1911, while Steve Yoder's began in 1982.\n\n4. **Compute the Number of Years Between Their Coaching Periods:**\n   - Subtract the end year of Haskell Noyes from the start year of Steve Yoder:\n     \\[\n     1982 - 1911 = 71 \\text{ years}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Haskell Noyes was a coach more than fifty years before Steve Yoder.\n   - Since there is an 71-year gap between their coaching periods, this satisfies the condition of being \"more than fifty years\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim is true because there are indeed more than fifty years between Haskell Noyes' and Steve Yoder's coaching periods.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Haskell Noyes coached from 1908 to 1911.
