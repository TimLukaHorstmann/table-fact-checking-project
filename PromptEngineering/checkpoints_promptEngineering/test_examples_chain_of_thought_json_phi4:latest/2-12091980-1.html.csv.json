    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"no game be play when the goal for be less than 30\" is true or false, we need to examine the data provided in the table for any instances where the number of goals scored (\"goals for\") is less than 30.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - The claim involves the \"goals for\" column, as it pertains to the number of goals scored by a team.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row in the Data:**\n   - We will look at each row's value under the \"goals for\" column to check if any value is less than 30.\n\n3. **Check Each Team's Goals For:**\n   - Ottawa Hockey Club: 90 goals for\n   - Montreal Wanderers: 74 goals for\n   - Montreal Victorias: 76 goals for\n   - Quebec Hockey Club: 57 goals for\n   - Montreal Hockey Club: 49 goals for\n   - Montreal Shamrocks: 30 goals for\n\n4. **Determine if Any Value is Less Than 30:**\n   - All teams have \"goals for\" values that are 30 or greater.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since no team has a \"goals for\" value less than 30, the claim holds true based on the data provided.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim 'no game be play when the goal for be less than 30', we examined each row's 'goals for' column.
