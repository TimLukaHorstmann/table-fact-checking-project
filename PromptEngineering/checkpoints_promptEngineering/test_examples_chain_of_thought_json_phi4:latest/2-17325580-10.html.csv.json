    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze the games listed in the table where the team won and check if their scores were under 100 points for at least 50% of these wins.\n\n**Step-by-step Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify Winning Games**: \n   - We will first identify which rows correspond to winning games by examining the \"score\" column. A game is considered a win if it's marked as 'w'.\n   \n2. **Extract Scores for Wins**:\n   - For each identified winning game, extract the score of the team that won.\n\n3. **Count Wins and Evaluate Score Conditions**:\n   - Count the total number of wins.\n   - Check how many of these wins had a team score under 100 points.\n\n4. **Calculate Percentage**:\n   - Calculate the percentage of wins where the winning team's score was under 100 points.\n   \n5. **Compare Against 50% Threshold**:\n   - Determine if this percentage is at least 50%.\n\n**Detailed Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify Winning Games**: \n   - From the table, the games marked with 'w' are:\n     - Game 77 (April 5 vs. San Antonio): Score \"101 - 81 (ot)\"\n     - Game 78 (April 8 vs. Washington): Score \"98 - 86 (ot)\"\n     - Game 79 (April 10 vs. Philadelphia): Score \"102 - 92 (ot)\"\n     - Game 80 (April 12 vs. Boston): Score \"107 - 76 (ot)\"\n     - Game 81 (April 13 vs. Indiana): Score \"117 - 109 (ot)\"\n\n2. **Extract Scores for Wins**:\n   - Team scores in these wins are:\n     - Game 77: 101 points\n     - Game 78: 98 points\n     - Game 79: 102 points\n     - Game 80: 107 points\n     - Game 81: 117 points\n\n3. **Count Wins and Evaluate Score Conditions**:\n   - Total number of wins = 5\n   - Wins with scores under 100 points:\n     - Game 78 (98 points)\n\n4. **Calculate Percentage**:\n   - Number of wins with score < 100 = 1\n   - Percentage = (1/5) * 100% = 20%\n\n5. **Compare Against 50% Threshold**:\n   - The percentage of wins where the team scored under 100 is 20%, which is less than 50%.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"the win team score under 100 point in 50% of the game list\" is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify winning games from the 'score' column marked with 'w'.\",\n    \"Extract scores for these winning games.\",\n    \"Count total wins and identify how many had team scores under 100 points.\",\n    \"Calculate the percentage of such wins.\",\n    \"Compare this percentage to 50% to determine if the claim is true.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

There is no mention of 4 assists by Darnell Jackson in any game.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The highest number of assists per game is not 11; it's 10.\n- Darnell Jackson did not record 4 assists in any game, nor did he achieve the lowest assist count for two games.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n1. **Highest Assists**: No entry matches 11 assists.\n2. **Darnell Jackson's Assists**: \n   - Game 82: \"high assists\" column lists Darnell Jackson with 8 assists alongside Wally Szczerbiak.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check the 'high assists' column for any value of 11.
