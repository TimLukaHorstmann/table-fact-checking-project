    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Detroit tie for the highest home team score\" is true or false, we need to evaluate the scores of all games where Detroit was the home team.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Home Games for Detroit:**\n   - We will look at rows where the `home` column contains \"detroit\". This indicates that Detroit was the home team in those games.\n   \n2. **Extract Scores of Home Games:**\n   - For each game where Detroit is the home team, we extract the score from the `score` column. The format of this column is `\"visitor_score - home_team_score\"`.\n   - We need to focus on the second part (after the dash) since it represents Detroit's score as the home team.\n\n3. **List Detroit's Home Team Scores:**\n   - January 2: Detroit vs Carolina, Score: `4 - 1` \u2192 Detroit's score = 1\n   - January 5: Nashville vs Detroit, Score: `0 - 6` \u2192 Detroit's score = 6\n   - January 7: Boston vs Detroit, Score: `3 - 0` \u2192 Detroit's score = 0\n   - January 14: Chicago vs Detroit, Score: `2 - 4` \u2192 Detroit's score = 4\n   - January 16: Phoenix vs Detroit, Score: `3 - 3` \u2192 Detroit's score = 3\n   - January 29: New Jersey vs Detroit, Score: `2 - 5` \u2192 Detroit's score = 5\n\n4. **Determine the Highest Score:**\n   - The scores for Detroit as the home team are: 1, 6, 0, 4, 3, and 5.\n   - The highest score is 6.\n\n5. **Check if There Are Ties for the Highest Score:**\n   - We need to check if any other team also scored 6 points in a game where they were the home team.\n   - Review each row where `home` column does not contain \"detroit\" and extract their scores:\n     - January 3: Detroit vs Anaheim, Score: `1 - 3` \u2192 Anaheim's score = 3\n     - January 10: Boston vs Detroit, Score: `1 - 2` \u2192 Boston's score = 2\n     - January 19: San Jose vs Detroit, Score: `1 - 2` \u2192 San Jose's score = 2\n     - January 21: Anaheim vs Detroit, Score: `2 - 2` \u2192 Anaheim's score = 2\n     - January 22: Los Angeles vs Detroit, Score: `4 - 5` \u2192 Los Angeles' score = 4\n     - January 24: Phoenix vs Detroit, Score: `5 - 2` \u2192 Phoenix's score = 5\n     - January 26: Dallas vs Detroit, Score: `2 - 2` \u2192 Dallas's score = 2\n     - January 31: Detroit vs Carolina, Score: `4 - 4` \u2192 Carolina's score = 4\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - No other home team scored 6 points in any game.\n   - Therefore, Detroit does not tie for the highest home team score; they have the highest score of 6 as a home team.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified all games where Detroit was the home team and extracted their scores.
