    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"all results have a score of 4\" is true or false, we need to examine each entry in the \"result f - a\" column of the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that all scores in the \"result f - a\" column should have a total score summing up to 4.\n\n2. **Examine Each Entry in the \"result f - a\" Column:**\n\n   - **Row 0:** \n     - Date: 31 January 1885\n     - Result: \"3 - 2\"\n     - Calculation: 3 + 2 = 5 (Not equal to 4)\n\n   - **Row 1:** \n     - Date: 14 February 1885\n     - Result: \"3 - 0\"\n     - Calculation: 3 + 0 = 3 (Not equal to 4)\n     \n   - **Row 2:** \n     - Date: 7 March 1885\n     - Result: \"3 - 0\"\n     - Calculation: 3 + 0 = 3 (Not equal to 4)\n     \n   - **Row 3:** \n     - Date: 18 April 1885\n     - Result: \"4 - 3 (aet)\"\n     - Calculation: 4 + 3 = 7 (Not equal to 4)\n\n   - **Row 4:** \n     - Date: 25 April 1885\n     - Result: \"0 - 3\"\n     - Calculation: 0 + 3 = 3 (Not equal to 4)\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - None of the scores in the table sum up to 4.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that all results have a score totaling 4.
