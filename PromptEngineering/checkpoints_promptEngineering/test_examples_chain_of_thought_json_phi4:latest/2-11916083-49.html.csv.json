We will compare the extracted issue price to see if it satisfies this condition.\n\n5. **Determine Truth Value**: If the issue price is indeed greater than 95, the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Looking at the table data:\n  - Row with \"year\" = 2008 and \"theme\" = \"amethyst crystal\":\n    - This corresponds to the third row in the data array.\n    - The \"issue price\" for this entry is 94.95.\n\n- **Comparison**:\n  - Compare 94.95 (the issue price) to 95:\n    - Since 94.95 is not greater than 95, the claim does not hold true.\n\nThus, based on these steps, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the final output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the entry for 'amethyst crystal' in the year 2008.
