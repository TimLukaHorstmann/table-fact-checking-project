Only the North Carolina Tar Heels have an equal number of wins and losses (7-7). Therefore, there is not four teams with equal wins and losses.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"loss\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
