Verify that the opponent for this week is 'kansas city chiefs' and check the attendance number. The opponent matches, but the attendance does not match the claimed value of 74,524; it is actually 77,778.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
