The table lists various championships held across different years and locations with information on winners in multiple categories.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Columns of Interest:**\n   - We are specifically interested in the \"year location\" column because it indicates where each event was hosted.\n\n2. **Filter Data for Relevant Years:**\n   - The claim specifies a time frame from 1997 to 2012, so we need to focus on entries within this range.\n\n3. **Count Occurrences of Yokohama:**\n   - We will count how many times \"Yokohama\" appears in the \"year location\" column for the specified years.\n\n4. **Extract Relevant Entries:**\n   - List all entries where the location is Yokohama between 1997 and 2012.\n\n5. **Verify the Count:**\n   - Ensure that the count of occurrences matches the number stated in the claim (four times).\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- From the data:\n  - 2001: \"yokohama\"\n  - 2006: \"yokohama\"\n  - 2007: \"chiba\" (not Yokohama)\n  - 2008: \"yokohama\"\n  - 2009: \"wakayama\" (not Yokohama)\n  - 2010: Not listed\n  - 2011: Not listed\n  - 2012: Not listed\n\n- Count of \"Yokohama\" between 1997 and 2012:\n  - 2001, 2006, 2008 are the years Yokohama was listed as a location.\n  \n- Total occurrences: 3 times.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that the ITTF Pro Tour was hosted in Yokohama four times between 1997 and 2012.
