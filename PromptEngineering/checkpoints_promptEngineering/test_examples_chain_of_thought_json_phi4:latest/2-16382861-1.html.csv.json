    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"3 schools have an enrollment of under 10000\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the enrollment data for each school listed in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Enrollment Data:**\n   - The relevant column for this task is \"enrollment\". We will check the value in this column for each row (school).\n\n2. **Examine Each School's Enrollment:**\n   - **University of Delaware:** Enrollment = 19067\n     - This enrollment is greater than 10000.\n   \n   - **Lebanon Valley College:** Enrollment = 2100\n     - This enrollment is less than 10000.\n\n   - **University of Rhode Island:** Enrollment = 19095\n     - This enrollment is greater than 10000.\n     \n   - **Rutgers University:** Enrollment = 56868\n     - This enrollment is greater than 10000.\n\n   - **Stony Brook University:** Enrollment = 23997\n     - This enrollment is greater than 10000.\n\n   - **West Chester University:** Enrollment = 12800\n     - This enrollment is greater than 10000.\n\n3. **Count Schools with Enrollment Under 10000:**\n   - Only Lebanon Valley College has an enrollment under 10000.\n   - Thus, there is only 1 school meeting the criteria of having an enrollment under 10000.\n\n4. **Compare Count to Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"3 schools have an enrollment of under 10000.\"\n   - Our count shows that only 1 school meets this criterion.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there is only 1 school with an enrollment under 10000, not 3 as claimed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the relevant column for enrollment data.\",\n    \"Examine each row to determine if the enrollment value is less than 10000.\",\n    \"University of Delaware: Enrollment = 19067 (greater than 10000)\",\n    \"Lebanon Valley College: Enrollment = 2100 (less than 10000)\",\n    \"University of Rhode Island: Enrollment = 19095 (greater than 10000)\",\n    \"Rutgers University: Enrollment = 56868 (greater than 10000)\",\n    \"Stony Brook University: Enrollment = 23997 (greater than 10000)\",\n    \"West Chester University: Enrollment = 12800 (greater than 10000)\",\n    \"Count the number of schools with enrollment under 10000.\",\n    \"Only Lebanon Valley College has an enrollment under 10000.\",\n    \"Compare this count to the claim that states 3 schools have an enrollment under 10000.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
