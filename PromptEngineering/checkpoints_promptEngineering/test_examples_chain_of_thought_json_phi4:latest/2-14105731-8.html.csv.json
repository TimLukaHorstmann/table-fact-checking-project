Let's break down our reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Episodes in Season 6**: \n   - We look at each row and identify which episodes are part of \"season 6\".\n   - From the table, episode 222 corresponds to \"season 6\" (row index 5), with title \"denisa's greedy doll / denisa's slumber party\".\n\n2. **Check Format for Season 6 Episodes**:\n   - For each identified season 6 episode, we check the format.\n   - Episode 222 has a format of \"q145\".\n\n3. **Compare with Claimed Format**:\n   - The claim states that the format is \"q245\".\n   - We compare this to our findings: the format for all episodes in season 6 is either \"q145\" or another format (as seen with episode 223, which has \"q146\").\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - There are no episodes in season 6 with a format of \"q245\".\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells for this determination are those that list the episodes in season 6 along with their formats.\n   - These include row index 5 (episode 222) and row index 6 (episode 223).\n\nHere's the final output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify all episodes in season 6.
