    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"the blue jays regularly draw more than 40000 fans in the month of June 2000\" is true or false, we need to analyze the attendance figures for each game in June as recorded in the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We are interested in the \"attendance\" column values for all games played in June.\n   \n2. **Extract Attendance Data:**\n   - Extract the attendance numbers from each row where the date is in June:\n     - June 1: 30444\n     - June 2: 12209\n     - June 3: 17546\n     - June 4: 11007\n     - June 5: 33641\n     - June 6: 39454\n     - June 7: 33240\n     - June 9: 26122\n     - June 10: 30239\n     - June 11: 25838\n     - June 12: 21779\n     - June 13: 23314\n     - June 14: 27479\n     - June 16: 33638\n     - June 17: 32951\n     - June 18: 32925\n     - June 20: 18850\n     - June 21: 18125\n     - June 22: 20259\n     - June 23: 28198\n     - June 24: 30130\n     - June 25: 31022\n     - June 27: 14657\n     - June 28: 15308\n     - June 29: 21666\n     - June 30: 40412\n\n3. **Determine Frequency of Attendance Over 40000:**\n   - Count how many games have attendance figures over 40000:\n     - June 5: 33641 (not over 40000)\n     - June 6: 39454 (not over 40000)\n     - June 7: 33240 (not over 40000)\n     - June 16: 33638 (not over 40000)\n     - June 17: 32951 (not over 40000)\n     - June 18: 32925 (not over 40000)\n     - June 24: 30130 (not over 40000)\n     - June 25: 31022 (not over 40000)\n     - June 30: 40412 (over 40000)\n\n   - Only one game, on June 30th, has an attendance exceeding 40000.\n\n4. **Interpret \"Regularly Draw More Than 40000\":**\n   - The term \"regularly\" implies a consistent pattern or frequency.\n   - With only one out of the 26 games in June having more than 40000 attendees, this does not meet the threshold for regularity.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since only one game had an attendance over 40000, it is incorrect to say that they \"regularly\" draw more than 40000 fans during June.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim, we analyzed all the games played in June from the table. We checked each game's attendance and found only one instance where attendance exceeded 40000.
