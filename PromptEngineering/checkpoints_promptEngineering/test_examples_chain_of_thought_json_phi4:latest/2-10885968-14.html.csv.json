    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the score for the away team North Melbourne being 7.14 (56) is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information**: \n   - The claim pertains to a specific match where \"North Melbourne\" was the away team.\n   \n2. **Locate North Melbourne as Away Team**:\n   - We will scan through the \"data\" array in the JSON table to find an entry where the \"away team\" is listed as \"north melbourne\".\n\n3. **Extract Match Details for North Melbourne as Away Team**:\n   - Once identified, we need to check both the away team score and home team details for that specific match.\n\n4. **Verify Claim Against Extracted Data**:\n   - According to the claim, the away team score should be 7.14 (56). We will compare this with the actual \"away team score\" from the table data.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Row**:\n   - Locate the row where North Melbourne is listed as the away team and extract both home and away scores along with their corresponding teams to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Scanning through the `data` array, we find that in the fourth entry (index 3):\n  ```json\n  [\n    \"st kilda\",\n    \"10.12 (72)\",\n    \"north melbourne\",\n    \"13.11 (89)\",\n    \"moorabbin oval\",\n    18486,\n    \"3 july 1976\"\n  ]\n  ```\n  - Here, the \"away team\" is indeed \"north melbourne\".\n  - The recorded score for North Melbourne in this match is \"13.11 (89)\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim states that North Melbourne's score should be 7.14 (56). However, from our examination of the table data:\n  - North Melbourne scored \"13.11 (89)\", not \"7.14 (56)\".\n  \nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that the score for the away team North Melbourne should be 7.14 (56).
