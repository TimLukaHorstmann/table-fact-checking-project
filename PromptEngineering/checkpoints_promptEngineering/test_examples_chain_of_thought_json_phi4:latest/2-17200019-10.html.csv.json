This represents the number of league titles, which typically include national championships and European competitions like the UEFA Champions League.\n\n2. **Extract Data for Jelle Van Damme**:\n   - According to the table, Jelle Van Damme has a value of 3 in the \"league\" column.\n\n3. **Identify Other Players with Non-Zero League Values**:\n   - We need to find other players who have non-zero values in the \"league\" column to compare with Jelle Van Damme.\n   - Relevant rows based on the league column are those where the value is greater than 0: mbark boussoufa (11), tom de sutter (9), guillaume gillet (8), marcin wasilewski (8), jonathan legear (5), nicol\u00e1s frutos (6), thomas chatelle (4), roland juh\u00e1sz (4), stanislav vl\u010dek (4), lucas biglia (2), dmitri bulykin (3), jan pol\u00e1k (2), mat\u00edas su\u00e1rez (1), hern\u00e1n losada (1), oleksandr iakovenko (2), v\u00edctor bern\u00e1rdez (1), bart goor (1).\n\n4. **Identify Players with League Values Close to Jelle Van Damme**:\n   - We need players whose league value is approximately one-third of Jelle Van Damme's value, which is 3.\n   - Possible candidates are those with a \"league\" value of 1.\n\n5. **Check Candidates Against the Claim**:\n   - Players with a league value of 1: mat\u00edas su\u00e1rez, hern\u00e1n losada, v\u00edctor bern\u00e1rdez, and bart goor.\n   - Jelle Van Damme's league count (3) is indeed three times that of these players' league counts (1).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is true for each player with a \"league\" value of 1 compared to Jelle Van Damme's count.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The 'league' column represents the number of league titles, which include UEFA Champions League titles.

However, based on typical usage, let's assume that \"league\" refers to domestic competitions, including cup performances.\n\n3. **Locate Players with Belgian Cup Goals:**\n   - We are told there are 4 players who played in the Belgian Cup. The table does not explicitly state which columns correspond to specific cups or titles, so we must infer from the context and data provided.\n   - Assume \"league\" includes Belgian Cup goals.\n\n4. **Identify Players with League Goals:**\n   - Lucas Biglia has 2 league goals (row index 10).\n   - Other players with non-zero league goals are:\n     - Mbark Boussoufa (11)\n     - Tom de Sutter (9)\n     - Guillaume Gillet (8)\n     - Marcin Wasilewski (8)\n     - Jonathan Legear (5)\n     - Nicolas Frutos (6)\n     - Thomas Chatelle (4)\n     - Roland Juh\u00e1sz (4)\n     - Stanislav Vl\u010dek (4)\n     - Jelle Van Damme (3)\n     - Oleksandr Yakovenko (2)\n     - Hern\u00e1n Losada (1)\n\n5. **Determine Players with Belgian Cup Goals:**\n   - We need to identify 4 players who have participated in the Belgian Cup based on their league goals.\n   - Assume Lucas Biglia is one of them since we are evaluating his performance.\n\n6. **Calculate Total League Goals for Other Players:**\n   - From the assumption, consider other players with non-zero league goals as potential Belgian Cup participants:\n     - Mbark Boussoufa (11)\n     - Tom de Sutter (9)\n     - Guillaume Gillet (8)\n     - Marcin Wasilewski (8)\n     - Jonathan Legear (5)\n     - Nicolas Frutos (6)\n     - Thomas Chatelle (4)\n     - Roland Juh\u00e1sz (4)\n     - Stanislav Vl\u010dek (4)\n     - Jelle Van Damme (3)\n     - Oleksandr Yakovenko (2)\n     - Hern\u00e1n Losada (1)\n\n7. **Select 3 Other Players:**\n   - Assume the next three players with the highest league goals are also Belgian Cup participants:\n     - Mbark Boussoufa (11)\n     - Tom de Sutter (9)\n     - Guillaume Gillet (8) or Marcin Wasilewski (8)\n\n8. **Calculate Combined Goals of Other Players:**\n   - Total for other players = 11 (Boussoufa) + 9 (De Sutter) + 8 (Gillet/Wasilewski) = 28\n\n9. **Compare Lucas Biglia's Goals to Others:**\n   - Lucas Biglia has 2 league goals.\n   - Combined goals of the other three players is 28.\n\n10. **Conclusion:**\n    - Lucas Biglia's 2 goals are not more than the combined 28 goals of the other three players.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Lucas Biglia scored more goals in the Belgian Cup than the other three players combined.
