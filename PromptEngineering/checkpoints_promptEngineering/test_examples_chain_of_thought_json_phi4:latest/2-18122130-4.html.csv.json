    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Craig Parry finishing 4 under par at T5 is true or false, we will analyze the provided table step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Data:**\n   - We are interested in finding information related to \"Craig Parry\" and his score details.\n   \n2. **Locate Craig Parry's Entry:**\n   - Examine each row in the data section of the table for an entry with the player name \"craig parry\".\n   - Find that Craig Parry is listed as follows:\n     ```json\n     [\n       \"t9\",\n       \"craig parry\",\n       \"australia\",\n       67,\n       \"- 4\"\n     ]\n     ```\n   \n3. **Check the Place Position (Tie):**\n   - The entry shows that Craig Parry is at position \"t9\", indicating he is tied for 9th place.\n   - Verify that he is not listed under T5.\n\n4. **Verify the Score and To Par:**\n   - According to the data, Craig Parry's score is 67 with a \"to par\" value of \"- 4\".\n   - This indicates he finished 4 strokes under par.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"Craig Parry in t5 finish 4 under par.\"\n   - From our analysis, Craig Parry's actual position is T9, not T5.\n   - Although his score indeed reflects finishing 4 under par, the positional part of the claim (T5) is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim is false because it incorrectly states Craig Parry's tie position as T5 instead of T9. While he did finish 4 under par, the place position in the claim does not match the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Craig Parry's entry shows he is at 't9', not 't5'. His score and to par value are correctly noted as 67 and '-4' respectively. Therefore, while his score matches the under-par claim, his position does not.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"place\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"to par\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
