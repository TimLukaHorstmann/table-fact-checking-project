Here, Washington scored 0 points.\n\n3. **Locate Game Against Buffalo**:\n   - Similarly, find entries where \"Buffalo\" is listed as either the home or visiting team.\n   - The relevant game is on November 26, where Buffalo won 3-1 against Washington. Here, Washington scored 1 point.\n\n4. **Compare Scores**:\n   - For Carolina: Washington scored 0 points.\n   - For Buffalo: Washington scored 1 point.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Washington scored fewer points in the game against Carolina than against Buffalo.\n   - Since 0 (points against Carolina) is indeed less than 1 (points against Buffalo), the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row for November 5: {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"} with value \"0 - 5\"\n- Row for November 26: {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"} with value \"3 - 1\"\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified games against Carolina and Buffalo.

This will help us locate games where Washington played against Philadelphia.\n   - From the table, there are two entries:\n     - November 2: Philadelphia (visitor), score \"3 - 2\", attendance 16055\n     - November 23: Philadelphia (home), score \"4 - 3\", attendance 19727\n\n2. **Check Attendances for These Games:**\n   - For the game on November 2 against Philadelphia, the attendance is 16,055.\n   - For the game on November 23 at home against Philadelphia, the attendance is 19,727.\n\n3. **Find the Game with the Lowest Attendance Overall:**\n   - We need to compare these attendances with all other games in the table to find the lowest overall attendance.\n   - Here are the attendances for each game:\n     - November 1: 18,200\n     - November 2: 16,055 (Philadelphia)\n     - November 5: 12,171\n     - November 6: 15,530\n     - November 8: 19,666\n     - November 10: 14,617\n     - November 15: 12,101\n     - November 16: 19,526\n     - November 19: 13,411\n     - November 21: 11,669\n     - November 23: 19,727 (Philadelphia)\n     - November 24: 13,650\n     - November 26: 11,204\n     - November 28: 10,526\n     - November 30: 16,386\n\n4. **Determine the Lowest Attendance:**\n   - The lowest attendance in the table is for the game on November 28 against Florida, with an attendance of 10,526.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the game on November 28 has a lower attendance than either of the games against Philadelphia, the claim that \"the game against Philadelphia had the lowest attendance\" is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant cells are those containing attendance data for all games and specifically for the games against Philadelphia.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify games where 'Philadelphia' appears in the visitor column.\",\n    \"Note the attendances for these games: November 2 (16055) and November 23 (19727).\",\n    \"List all game attendances to find the lowest overall attendance.\",\n    \"The lowest attendance is 10526 on November 28 against Florida.\",\n    \"Since 10526 < 16055 and 10526 < 19727, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
