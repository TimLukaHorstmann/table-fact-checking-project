    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Phil Mickelson be the only player from United States\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the data provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that Phil Mickelson should be the only player from the United States. This implies that no other players from the United States are listed, except for Phil Mickelson.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - We need to look at the \"player\" and \"country\" columns to identify all players who are from the United States.\n   \n3. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: \n     - Player: Mark Brooks\n     - Country: United States\n   - **Row 2**: \n     - Player: Kenny Perry\n     - Country: United States\n   - **Row 4**: \n     - Player: Tommy Tolles\n     - Country: United States\n   - **Row 8**: \n     - Player: Lee Janzen\n     - Country: United States\n   - **Row 9**:\n     - Player: Phil Mickelson\n     - Country: United States\n   - **Row 12**:\n     - Player: Larry Mize\n     - Country: United States\n\n4. **Count the Players from the United States**:\n   - From the data, we have identified six players from the United States:\n     - Mark Brooks\n     - Kenny Perry\n     - Tommy Tolles\n     - Lee Janzen\n     - Phil Mickelson\n     - Larry Mize\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim is that Phil Mickelson should be the only player from the United States, but we have found six players from the United States in total.\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n6. **List Relevant Cells**:\n   - We need to list all cells where the country is \"United States\" and include both the player names and their respective row indices for clarity.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists multiple players from the United States, including Mark Brooks, Kenny Perry, Tommy Tolles, Lee Janzen, Phil Mickelson, and Larry Mize.
