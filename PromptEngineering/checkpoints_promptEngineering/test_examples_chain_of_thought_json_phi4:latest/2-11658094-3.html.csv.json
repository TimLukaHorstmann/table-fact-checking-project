It left its conference in 1975.\n\nThe location associated with these conditions should be Hickory, North Carolina.\n\nLet's analyze each relevant column step by step:\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1. **Identify the \"founded\" year:**\n   - We need to find a row where the \"founded\" value is 1891.\n\n2. **Check the \"left\" year:**\n   - For the same row, verify if the \"left\" column has the value 1975.\n\n3. **Determine the \"location\":**\n   - Confirm that the \"location\" for this row is Hickory, North Carolina.\n\n### Examination of Table Data\n\nLet's check each entry in the data to see which satisfies both conditions:\n\n- **Row 8 (Lenoir-Rhyne University):**\n  - Founded: 1891\n  - Left: 1975\n  - Location: Hickory, North Carolina\n\nThis row matches all the specified criteria.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is true because there exists an institution in the table that was founded in 1891, left its conference in 1975, and is located in Hickory, North Carolina.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify rows where 'founded' equals 1891.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to evaluate it against the data provided in the table:\n\n1. **Identify Key Elements of the Claim:**\n   - The institution must be a former private member.\n   - It should have been founded in 1839.\n   - It left its conference or association in 1975.\n   - Its location is Hickory, North Carolina.\n\n2. **Evaluate Each Element Against Data:**\n\n   - **Institution Founded in 1839:**\n     - From the table, we look for an institution with a founding year of 1839:\n       - Longwood University has a founding year of 1839.\n   \n   - **Check if it is a Private Institution:**\n     - According to the data, Longwood University is categorized as \"public.\"\n\n3. **Evaluate Location and Conference Change Year:**\n\n   - **Location in Hickory, North Carolina:**\n     - The institution Lenoir-Rhyne University is located in Hickory, North Carolina.\n   \n   - **Conference Left in 1975:**\n     - Lenoir-Rhyne University left its conference in 1975.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n\n   - Although Lenoir-Rhyne University matches the location (Hickory, North Carolina) and the year it left a conference (1975), it does not match the founding year of 1839 or being private.\n   - Longwood University is founded in 1839 but is public, not private.\n\nGiven these evaluations, no institution fits all parts of the claim simultaneously.
