We will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:** Locate the row corresponding to the week starting on March 16 in the table.\n\n2. **Extract Surface Information:** Check the \"surface\" column for this specific entry to determine what type of surface was used for the tournament during that week.\n\n3. **Compare with Claim:** Verify if the surface information matches the claim, which states it should be a hard surface.\n\n4. **Conclude Truthfulness:** Based on the comparison, decide whether the claim is true or false.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - The row corresponding to \"week\" starting March 16 is:\n     ```\n     [\n       \"key biscane\",\n       \"hard\",\n       \"march 16\",\n       \"marcelo r\\u00edos 7 - 5 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 4\",\n       \"andre agassi\",\n       \"\\u00e0lex corretja tim henman\"\n     ]\n     ```\n\n2. **Extract Surface Information:**\n   - From the above row, under the column \"surface,\" the value is \"hard.\"\n\n3. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the game during the week of March 16 was played on a hard surface.\n   - Our extracted information confirms this as it also indicates \"hard\" for the surface.\n\n4. **Conclude Truthfulness:**\n   - Since the extracted data matches the claim, the claim is true.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The row corresponding to the week starting on March 16 shows that the tournament was played on a hard surface.
