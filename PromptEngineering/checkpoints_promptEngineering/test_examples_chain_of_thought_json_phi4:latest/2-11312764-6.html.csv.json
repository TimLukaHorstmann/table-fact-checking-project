    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"United Kingdom finish with 187.84 points\" is TRUE or FALSE, let's go through the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Entries for the United Kingdom:**\n   - We need to locate all entries where the \"nation\" column has the value \"united kingdom.\"\n\n2. **Extract Points for Each United Kingdom Entry:**\n   - For each entry identified in step 1, extract the points from the \"points\" column.\n\n3. **Check if Any Entry Matches 187.84 Points:**\n   - Verify if any of the extracted points matches exactly with 187.84.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n- **Step 1:** Locate entries for \"united kingdom\":\n  - Row 5: \"janet thompson / warren maxwell\", 194.0 points\n  - Row 8: \"jayne torvill / christopher dean\", 187.84 points\n  - Row 13: \"karen barber / nicky slater\", 169.74 points\n\n- **Step 2:** Extract the points:\n  - From Row 5: 194.0 points\n  - From Row 8: 187.84 points\n  - From Row 13: 169.74 points\n\n- **Step 3:** Check for 187.84 points:\n  - The entry from Row 8 has exactly 187.84 points.\n\nSince there is an entry for the United Kingdom with 187.84 points, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify entries where 'nation' is 'united kingdom'.
