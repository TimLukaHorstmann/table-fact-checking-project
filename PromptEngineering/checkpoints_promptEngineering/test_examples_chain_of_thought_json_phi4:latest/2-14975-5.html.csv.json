This corresponds to the third data entry in the list.\n\n2. **Check the \"Games Played\" Column:**\n   - For the identified row (third entry), examine the value in the \"games played\" column.\n   - The value provided is \"90 games\".\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim Against the Data:**\n   - The claim states that \"more than 100 games have been played for the series with the sawhorse dollar trophy.\"\n   - Compare this to the data, which shows \"90 games\".\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since 90 is not more than 100, the claim does not hold true based on the data provided.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant cells from the table are those that pertain to the \"sawhorse dollar\" trophy series.\n- Specifically, these cells are in row index 2 (third entry) and include:\n  - Column \"trophy\": Value is \"sawhorse dollar\".\n  - Column \"games played\": Value is \"90 games\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim refers to the series with the 'sawhorse dollar' trophy.
