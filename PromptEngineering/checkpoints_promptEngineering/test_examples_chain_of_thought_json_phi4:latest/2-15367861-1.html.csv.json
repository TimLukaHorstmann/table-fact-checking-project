    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Corinthians is true, we need to analyze the data provided for this team.\n\n### Claim:\n\"There be zero loss that Corinthians received when they scored over 25 points.\"\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Corinthians Data:**\n   - Locate the row corresponding to \"corinthians\" in the table.\n   - For \"corinthians,\" we have:\n     - Points: 22\n     - Played: 22\n     - Drawn: 2\n     - Lost: 10\n     - Against (goals scored): 51\n     - Difference: \"-20\"\n\n2. **Calculate Goals Scored Per Match:**\n   - The \"against\" column indicates the total goals scored by Corinthians.\n   - To find average goals per match, divide the total goals by the number of matches played:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average goals per match} = \\frac{51}{22} \\approx 2.32\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine Matches with More than 25 Goals:**\n   - The claim refers to instances where Corinthians scored over 25 points in a single match.\n   - Since the average is approximately 2.32 goals per match, it's unlikely they scored more than 25 goals in any individual match.\n\n4. **Evaluate Losses:**\n   - Corinthians has 10 losses in total.\n   - Given the average goals per match and typical scoring patterns, it's highly improbable that they scored over 25 goals in a single match while losing.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since it is statistically and practically unlikely for Corinthians to have scored more than 25 goals in any match (let alone while losing), the claim holds true by default.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The 'against' column shows total goals scored by Corinthians as 51 over 22 matches, averaging about 2.32 goals per match.
