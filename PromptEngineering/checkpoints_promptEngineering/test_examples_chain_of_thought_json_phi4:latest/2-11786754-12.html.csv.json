    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"5.3 be the average that have more than 0 touchdown and more than 135 yard.\"\n\nThis means we need to find players who satisfy two conditions:\n1. More than 0 touchdowns.\n2. More than 135 yards.\n\nFor these players, we then calculate their average receiving yards per catch (`avg`) and check if it is equal to 5.3.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Players with More Than 0 Touchdowns:**\n   - \"rob turner\": 4 touchdowns\n   - \"kevin ingram\": 1 touchdown\n   - \"robert quiroga\": 2 touchdowns\n   - \"josh jeffries\": 3 touchdowns\n\n2. **Filter These Players for More Than 135 Yards:**\n   - \"rob turner\": 171 yards\n   - \"kevin ingram\": 135 yards (exactly 135, not more)\n   - \"robert quiroga\": 16 yards\n   - \"josh jeffries\": 58 yards\n\nFrom this filtering, only \"rob turner\" meets both conditions: more than 0 touchdowns and more than 135 yards.\n\n3. **Check the Average for \"Rob Turner\":**\n   - \"rob turner\" has an average of 10.6.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - There is only one player who meets the criteria, and their average is not 5.3. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify players with more than 0 touchdowns: 'rob turner', 'kevin ingram', 'robert quiroga', 'josh jeffries'. Then filter these for more than 135 yards: only 'rob turner' qualifies. Check his average, which is 10.6, not 5.3. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"td 's\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"yards\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"avg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
