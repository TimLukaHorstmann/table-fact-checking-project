Therefore, every game identified must have the opponent as \"brewers\".\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n- **June 2:** Attendance = 33,584; Opponent = Red Sox\n- **June 3:** Attendance = 33,942; Opponent = Red Sox\n- **June 4:** Attendance = 33,760; Opponent = Red Sox\n- **June 5:** Attendance = 48,378; Opponent = Brewers (Relevant)\n- **June 6:** Attendance = 45,520; Opponent = Brewers (Relevant)\n- **June 7:** Attendance = 45,372; Opponent = Brewers (Relevant)\n- **June 9:** Attendance = 48,219; Opponent = Tigers\n- **June 10:** Attendance = 48,430; Opponent = Tigers\n- **June 11:** Attendance = 48,274; Opponent = Tigers\n- **June 12:** Attendance = 48,531; Opponent = Tigers\n- **June 16:** Attendance = 48,363; Opponent = Mariners\n- **June 17:** Attendance = 48,336; Opponent = Mariners\n- **June 18:** Attendance = 48,329; Opponent = Mariners\n- **June 19:** Attendance = 24,430; Opponent = Angels\n- **June 20:** Attendance = 23,956; Opponent = Angels (Not > 20,000)\n- **June 21:** Attendance = 24,259; Opponent = Angels\n- **June 22:** Attendance = 21,418; Opponent = Athletics (Relevant)\n- **June 23:** Attendance = 27,795; Opponent = Athletics (Relevant)\n- **June 24:** Attendance = 39,659; Opponent = Athletics (Relevant)\n- **June 25:** Attendance = 49,219; Opponent = Athletics (Relevant)\n- **June 27:** Attendance = 30,136; Opponent = Orioles\n- **June 28:** Attendance = 35,757; Opponent = Orioles\n- **June 29:** Attendance = 39,528; Opponent = Orioles\n- **June 30:** Attendance = 48,429; Opponent = Red Sox\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe games with attendance greater than 20,000 are:\n- June 5, 6, and 7 against the Brewers.\n- June 9 to June 12 against the Tigers.\n- June 16 to June 18 against the Mariners.\n- June 19 and 21 against the Angels.\n- June 22 to June 25 against the Athletics.\n- June 27 to June 29 against the Orioles.\n- June 30 against the Red Sox.\n\nSince not all games with attendance greater than 20,000 were played against the Brewers, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified all games with attendance > 20,000 and checked their opponents.

It lists other teams such as the Red Sox, Brewers, Tigers, Mariners, Angels, Athletics, Orioles, and no entry for the Blue Jays.\n\n2. **Data Analysis**:\n   - Since there are no entries in the data column labeled \"opponent\" that say \"Blue Jays,\" it implies there were no recorded games against them within this dataset.\n   \n3. **Conclusion Based on Data**:\n   - If there are zero games listed against the Blue Jays, we cannot calculate an average attendance for those games because there is no attendance data to work with.\n   - The claim specifies a condition about \"each game of the Blue Jays'1989 season,\" but since there's no data available in this dataset, it implies that either no such games were recorded or they do not exist within the provided entries.\n\n4. **Assessment of Claim**:\n   - Since there are zero games listed against the Blue Jays and thus no attendance figures to average, we cannot assert a specific average value.\n   - The absence of data does not allow us to conclude that \"on average, less than 30,000 crowd attend each game\" as it simply lacks any basis in this dataset.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - Given the lack of relevant games against the Blue Jays in the provided table, we cannot confirm or deny the claim based on this data alone.\n   - However, from a logical perspective considering zero entries for games and attendance, one might interpret that there's no evidence to support an average attendance figure above 30,000 as there are no figures at all.\n\nThus, while the dataset does not contradict the possibility of having less than 30,000 attendance due to lack of any recorded data against Blue Jays, it doesn't specifically validate the claim either.
