We need to compare this directly with what is present in the table under the \"pictorials\" column for the 11 - 98 issue.\n\n5. **Determine if the Claim Matches Exactly:**\n   - Check if the content from the table exactly matches \"girl of the acc\".\n\nNow, let's execute these steps:\n\n1. The \"pictorials\" column contains information about pictorials for each date.\n2. Locate the row with \"date\" as \"11 - 98\". This is row index 10 in the data array (considering zero-based indexing).\n3. In this row, under the \"pictorials\" column, the content is listed as \"girls of the acc\".\n4. Compare \"girls of the acc\" with the claim \"girl of the acc\":\n   - The table entry is \"girls of the acc\", whereas the claim states \"girl of the acc\".\n5. Since \"girls of the acc\" does not match exactly with \"girl of the acc\", the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The 'pictorials' column for the date '11 - 98' contains 'girls of the acc'.
