This matches the score mentioned in the claim.\n\n4. **Check Home/Away Status**:\n   - The \"home\" column should indicate whether the Clippers were playing at home or not.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about game attendance in April 2008 being between 10392 and 20084 is true, we need to analyze each row of the data related to game attendance.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Column for Attendance:**\n   - The column containing the \"attendance\" values is clearly labeled as such in the table under the \"columns\" section.\n\n2. **Extract Attendance Values:**\n   - We extract the attendance numbers from each row where the \"date\" falls in April 2008:\n     - Row 1: Attendance = 10392\n     - Row 2: Attendance = 12707\n     - Row 3: Attendance = 17932\n     - Row 4: Attendance = 19060\n     - Row 5: Attendance = 20084\n     - Row 6: Attendance = 19706\n     - Row 7: Attendance = 17388\n     - Row 8: Attendance = 18386\n\n3. **Verify Each Value Against the Claimed Range:**\n   - The claim states that attendance values should be between 10392 and 20084, inclusive.\n   - Check each extracted value:\n     - 10392 is within the range (inclusive).\n     - 12707 is within the range.\n     - 17932 is within the range.\n     - 19060 is within the range.\n     - 20084 is within the range (inclusive).\n     - 19706 is within the range.\n     - 17388 is within the range.\n     - 18386 is within the range.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - All attendance values fall within or on the boundaries of the specified range (10392 to 20084).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe claim that \"throughout all game in April 2008, a game attendance stays between 10392 - 20084\" is true based on the analysis.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identified 'attendance' column for data extraction.\",\n    \"Extracted attendance values for games played in April 2008: 10392, 12707, 17932, 19060, 20084, 19706, 17388, and 18386.\",\n    \"Verified each extracted value against the specified range (10392 to 20084).\",\n    \"All values are within or on the boundaries of the specified range.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
