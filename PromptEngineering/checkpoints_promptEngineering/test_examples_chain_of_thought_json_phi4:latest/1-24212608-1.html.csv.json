We need to identify which row it is.\n\n3. **Check the Corresponding Radio 1 Presenter:**\n   - Once we find the row with 9.73 million viewers, check the corresponding entry in the \"radio 1 presenter\" column.\n   - Verify if \"nihal\" is listed as the presenter for that particular broadcast.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - If \"nihal\" is indeed the Radio 1 presenter for the row with 9.73 million viewers, then the claim is TRUE.\n   - Otherwise, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- From the table:\n  - The row where \"viewers (millions)\" equals 9.73 is:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"episode\": 8,\n      \"broadcast date\": 2012,\n      \"bbc one presenter (s)\": \"gabby logan\",\n      \"starring\": \"n / a\",\n      \"radio 1 presenter\": \"nihal\",\n      \"viewers (millions)\": 9.73\n    }\n    ```\n- In this row, the \"radio 1 presenter\" is indeed \"nihal\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that \"Nihal be the radio 1 presenter for the broadcast that have 9.73 million viewer\" is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the row with 'viewers (millions)' equal to 9.73, then check the 'radio 1 presenter' column in that row.
