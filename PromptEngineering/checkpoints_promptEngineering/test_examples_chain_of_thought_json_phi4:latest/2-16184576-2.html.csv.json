This indicates that it lists the annual win-loss record for Grand Slam tournaments.\n\n3. **Extract Data for Relevant Years:**\n   - From the data, we need to extract the win-loss records specifically for 1995, 1996, and 1997.\n   \n4. **Analyze Each Year:**\n   - For each year from 1995 to 1997, find the corresponding cell under \"annual win - loss\" for \"grand slam\":\n     - **1995:** Check if it matches \"5-4\".\n     - **1996:** Check if it matches \"5-4\".\n     - **1997:** Check if it matches \"5-4\".\n\n### Data Extraction\n\n1. **Extract Yearly Records:**\n   - **1995 (row 3):** The cell under the column \"annual win - loss\" for \"grand slam\" is \"0 / 2\", which translates to a record of 0 wins and 2 losses.\n   - **1996 (row 4):** The cell under the column \"annual win - loss\" for \"grand slam\" is \"5 / 3\", translating to 5 wins and 3 losses.\n   - **1997 (row 5):** The cell under the column \"annual win - loss\" for \"grand slam\" is \"5 / 4\", translating to 5 wins and 4 losses.\n\n2. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - For 1995, the record was 0-2, not 5-4.\n   - For 1996, the record was 5-3, not 5-4.\n   - For 1997, the record was indeed 5-4.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that in all three years (1995, 1996, and 1997), the annual win-loss for Grand Slam was \"5-4\".
