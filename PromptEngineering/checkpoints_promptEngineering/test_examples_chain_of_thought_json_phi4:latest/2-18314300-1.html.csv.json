FC Saarbr\u00fccken in the 2005/06 season be the only club to score zero goal\" is true or false, we will analyze the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Season:**\n   - The claim specifically refers to the \"2005 / 06\" season.\n\n2. **Locate Data for the 2005/06 Season:**\n   - In the table, locate entries with \"season\" as \"2005 / 06\". There are two entries:\n     - One entry lists \"1. FC Saarbr\u00fccken\", \"Germany\", with \"apps\": \"10\" and \"goals\": \"0\".\n     - Another entry lists \"SV Zulte Waregem\", \"Belgium\", with \"apps\": \"14\" and \"goals\": \"1\".\n\n3. **Analyze the Goals Scored:**\n   - For \"1. FC Saarbr\u00fccken\":\n     - They have \"0\" goals in the 2005/06 season.\n   - For \"SV Zulte Waregem\":\n     - They scored \"1\" goal in the same season.\n\n4. **Determine Uniqueness of Zero Goals:**\n   - We need to check if any other club, apart from \"1. FC Saarbr\u00fccken\", scored zero goals during this season.\n   - From the two entries under \"2005 / 06\", only \"1. FC Saarbr\u00fccken\" has \"0\" goals.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since no other club is listed with \"0\" goals in the 2005/06 season, it confirms that \"1.
