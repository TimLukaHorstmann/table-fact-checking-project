However, in the relevant rows (8 and 9), while the events are part of this series, the 'record' column values are 'qualifying' and 'race', not 'nascar camping world truck series'.

This means examining each row in the table and checking if the first cell under \"record\" matches \"qualifying\".\n\n3. **Extract Time Values for Qualifying Records**:\n   - For each qualifying entry, extract the corresponding time value from the \"time\" column.\n\n4. **Compare Times to Find the Minimum**:\n   - Compare all extracted times to determine which one is the smallest (i.e., the record qualifying time).\n\n5. **Verify the Claim Against the Smallest Time**:\n   - Check if the smallest time matches 24.521 as stated in the claim.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n- **Row 2**: \n  - Record: \"qualifying\"\n  - Date: \"september 14 , 2013\"\n  - Driver: \"joey logano\"\n  - Time: \"28.509\"\n  - Speed / Avg Speed: \"-\"\n  \n- **Row 4**:\n  - Record: \"qualifying\"\n  - Date: \"july 8 , 2005\"\n  - Driver: \"ryan newman\"\n  - Time: \"28.964\"\n  - Speed / Avg Speed: \"-\"\n\n- **Row 7**:\n  - Record: \"qualifying\"\n  - Date: \"july 21 , 2012\"\n  - Driver: \"justin lofton\"\n  - Time: \"31.007\"\n  - Speed / Avg Speed: \"-\"\n\n- **Row 11**:\n  - Record: \"qualifying\"\n  - Date: \"september 6 , 2003\"\n  - Driver: \"richie hearn\"\n  - Time: \"24.521\"\n  - Speed / Avg Speed: \"-\"\n\n### Comparison:\n\n- The qualifying times extracted are: 28.509, 28.964, 31.007, and 24.521.\n- The smallest time among these is 24.521.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that the record qualifying time is 24.521, which matches our finding from the table data.
