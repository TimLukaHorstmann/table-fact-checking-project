Identify 'goals against' for Montreal Shamrocks from the table, which is 56.\\n2. Identify 'goals against' for Ottawa Hockey Club from the table, which is 26.\\n3. Calculate the difference: 56 - 26 = 30.\\n4. The claim states a difference of 20, but the actual difference is 30.\\n5. Therefore, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goals against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
