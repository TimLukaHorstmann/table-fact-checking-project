By scanning through the data:\n     - The entry with `row_index` 3 matches this date.\n\n2. **Extract Information from the Relevant Row**:\n   - From `row_index` 3, we extract the following information:\n     - `\"episode\": 4`\n     - `\"original airdate\": \"8 june 2008\"`\n     - `\"timeslot (approx)\": \"sunday 6:30 - 7:30 pm\"`\n     - `\"viewers (millions)\": 1.364`\n     - `\"nightly rank\": 4`\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the least watched episode with an original airdate of \"8 june 2008\" is episode number 4.\n   - We have found that the episode aired on this date has the following viewership: 1.364 million, which matches the episode number 4.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the episode with the airdate \"8 june 2008\" is indeed episode number 4, and there are no other episodes with this airdate to compare, the claim holds true.\n   \nThus, based on the table data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The relevant row for 'original airdate' of '8 june 2008' has an 'episode' number of 4.
