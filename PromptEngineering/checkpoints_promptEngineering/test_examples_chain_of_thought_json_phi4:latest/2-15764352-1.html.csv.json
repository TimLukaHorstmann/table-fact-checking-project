    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"no game play on ground that be only play at 1 time\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table data for matches played at each ground. The goal is to identify if there's any ground where exactly one match was played.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Grounds and Count Matches:**\n   - We will go through each entry in the \"data\" array of the JSON and count how many times each ground appears under the \"ground\" column.\n   \n2. **Ground Analysis:**\n   - **Humber College North**: \n     - Appears in row 0, time 10:00.\n     - Appears in row 1, time 12:00.\n     - Appears in row 2, time 15:00.\n     - Total count = 3 matches.\n   \n   - **Rideau Carleton Raceway**:\n     - Appears in row 3, time 14:00.\n     - Total count = 1 match.\n\n   - **Magaret Green Park**:\n     - Appears in row 4, time 14:00.\n     - Total count = 1 match.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that no game was played on a ground that had only one match scheduled. \n   - We found two grounds with exactly one match each: \"Rideau Carleton Raceway\" and \"Magaret Green Park\".\n   - Therefore, there are indeed games played on grounds that were used for only one match.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since we identified grounds with exactly one game, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 3, Column \"ground\": Rideau Carleton Raceway\n- Row 4, Column \"ground\": Magaret Green Park\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, count how many times each ground appears in the data.
