    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the data from the table regarding Nathan Chandler Vanderberg's football statistics for the Iowa team.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"404 attempt be there for vanderberg on iowa when the record yard be 2249.\"\n\nThis can be broken down into two parts:\n1. **Attempts**: The claim suggests that there are 404 attempts.\n2. **Yards**: It mentions a specific record of 2249 yards.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Attempt Value**:\n   - Look for the row where the \"attempts\" value is 404.\n   - In the table, we find that in the year 2011, under the team \"iowa\", the \"attempts\" are listed as 404.\n\n2. **Check Corresponding Yards for 2011**:\n   - For the same row (year 2011), check the corresponding \"yards\".\n   - The \"yards\" value is 3022 for the year 2011.\n\n3. **Identify the Year with 2249 Yards**:\n   - Look through the table to find where \"yards\" equals 2249.\n   - In the year 2012, under the team \"iowa\", the \"yards\" are listed as 2249.\n\n4. **Check Corresponding Attempts for 2249 Yards**:\n   - For the same row (year 2012), check the corresponding \"attempts\".\n   - The \"attempts\" value is 389 for the year 2012.\n\n5. **Comparison**:\n   - In 2011, with 404 attempts, the yards are 3022.\n   - In 2012, with 2249 yards, the attempts are 389.\n   - There is no instance where 404 attempts correspond to 2249 yards.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that \"404 attempt be there for vanderberg on iowa when the record yard be 2249\" is false.
