    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Chelsea FC's 2004-2005 season dates is true, we need to verify two key pieces of information from the provided table:\n\n1. **Start Date**: The first match date listed should be August 15, 2004.\n2. **End Date**: The last match date listed should be May 15, 2005.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Start Date**:\n   - Check the \"date\" column in the first row of the table data to see if it matches August 15, 2004.\n   - The first entry is indeed \"15 august 2004\".\n\n2. **Identify the End Date**:\n   - Check the \"date\" column in the last row of the table data to see if it matches May 15, 2005.\n   - The final entry is \"15 may 2005\".\n\n3. **Verify Continuity**:\n   - Ensure that the dates are continuous and cover all days from August 15, 2004, to May 15, 2005, without any missing periods in between. Since we're only asked about the start and end dates, this is implicitly confirmed by checking the first and last entries.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The table starts on \"15 august 2004\" and ends on \"15 may 2005\", which matches the claim.\n\nThus, the claim that Chelsea FC's 2004-2005 season goes from August 15, 2004, to May 15, 2005, is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table starts with a match on '15 august 2004' and ends with a match on '15 may 2005'.
