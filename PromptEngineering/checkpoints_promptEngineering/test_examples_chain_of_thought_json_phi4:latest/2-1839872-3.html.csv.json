    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"in 1970 - 1996 the citation be it 's an honour'\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table data based on specific criteria mentioned in the claim.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Time Frame**: The claim specifies a time frame from 1970 to 1996. We should focus on rows where the \"employed\" column overlaps with this period.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Rows**:\n   - From the table, we have entries for individuals employed during part or all of this period:\n     - Swain, Peter Leonard (1970 - 1996)\n     - Woosnam, Clive Thomas (1970 - 2005)\n     - Zimmerman, Roy Alfred (1966 - 1996)\n\n3. **Check Citation**:\n   - For each relevant entry, we need to verify if the \"citation\" column states \"it 's an honour\".\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - Swain, Peter Leonard: The citation is \"it 's an honour\".\n   - Woosnam, Clive Thomas: The citation is \"it 's an honour\".\n   - Zimmerman, Roy Alfred: The citation is \"it 's an honour\".\n\n5. **Conclusion**: All individuals employed during the specified period (1970 - 1996) have the citation \"it 's an honour\".
