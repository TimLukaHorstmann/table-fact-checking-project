    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"all of the England player take as many wicket as Bill Johnston\" is true or false, let's analyze the relevant data step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Bill Johnston's Wickets:**\n   - From the table, locate Bill Johnston's entry:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"player\": \"bill johnston\",\n       \"team\": \"australia\",\n       \"matches\": 5,\n       \"wickets\": 27,\n       \"average\": 23.33,\n       \"best bowling\": \"5 / 36\"\n     }\n     ```\n   - Bill Johnston took 27 wickets.\n\n2. **Identify England Players:**\n   - From the table, identify players who played for England:\n     - Alec Bedser\n     - Norman Yardley\n     - Jim Laker\n\n3. **Compare Wickets Taken by Each England Player to Bill Johnston's Wickets:**\n\n   - **Alec Bedser:**\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"player\": \"alec bedser\",\n       \"team\": \"england\",\n       \"matches\": 5,\n       \"wickets\": 18,\n       \"average\": 38.22,\n       \"best bowling\": \"4 / 81\"\n     }\n     ```\n     - Alec Bedser took 18 wickets, which is less than 27.\n\n   - **Norman Yardley:**\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"player\": \"norman yardley\",\n       \"team\": \"england\",\n       \"matches\": 5,\n       \"wickets\": 9,\n       \"average\": 22.66,\n       \"best bowling\": \"2 / 32\"\n     }\n     ```\n     - Norman Yardley took 9 wickets, which is less than 27.\n\n   - **Jim Laker:**\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"player\": \"jim laker\",\n       \"team\": \"england\",\n       \"matches\": 3,\n       \"wickets\": 9,\n       \"average\": 52.44,\n       \"best bowling\": \"4 / 138\"\n     }\n     ```\n     - Jim Laker took 9 wickets, which is less than 27.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - None of the England players (Alec Bedser, Norman Yardley, Jim Laker) took as many wickets as Bill Johnston.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's structure this reasoning into a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify Bill Johnston's number of wickets which is 27. Then, list all England players and their respective wicket counts: Alec Bedser with 18, Norman Yardley with 9, and Jim Laker with 9. Compare these numbers to Bill Johnston's 27 wickets. All England players took fewer wickets than Bill Johnston.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wickets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"wickets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"wickets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"wickets\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
