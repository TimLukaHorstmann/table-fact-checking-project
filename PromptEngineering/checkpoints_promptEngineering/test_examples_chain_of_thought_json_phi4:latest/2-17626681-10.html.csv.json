    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Manchester United FC's 2008-09 season attendance is true, we need to analyze the provided data for each match, focusing on the \"attendance\" column. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that in the 2008-09 season, the final round (the Champions League Final) had a higher attendance than any other game listed.\n\n2. **Identify the Final Game Attendance**:\n   - Look for the row labeled \"final\" to find the attendance of the last match.\n   - In this table, the final is against Barcelona on 27 May 2009 with an attendance of 62,467.\n\n3. **Compare with Other Games**:\n   - Examine the attendance numbers for all other games listed in the data.\n   - The attendances are as follows:\n     - 24 February 2009: Internazionale (Home) - 80,018\n     - 11 March 2009: Internazionale (Away) - 74,769\n     - 7 April 2009: Porto (Home) - 74,517\n     - 15 April 2009: Porto (Away) - 50,010\n     - 29 April 2009: Arsenal (Home) - 74,733\n     - 5 May 2009: Arsenal (Away) - 59,867\n\n4. **Determine the Highest Attendance**:\n   - Compare these attendance figures with the final's attendance of 62,467.\n   - The highest attendance among all games is 80,018 for the first knockout round match against Internazionale on 24 February 2009.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the attendance for the final (62,467) is not higher than the highest attendance recorded in another game (80,018), the claim is false.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can provide our conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim asserts that the final match had a higher attendance than any other listed match.\",\n    \"Identify the attendance for the final match: 62,467 against Barcelona.\",\n    \"List all other attendances and find the highest one: 80,018 against Internazionale on 24 February 2009.\",\n    \"Compare the final's attendance with the highest attendance from another game.\",\n    \"Since 62,467 is less than 80,018, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
