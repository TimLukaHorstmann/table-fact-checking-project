This can be done by searching through the \"district\" column.\n\n2. **Check the Incumbent Name**: Once we find the row for \"Texas 17\", we will check the value under the \"incumbent\" column to see if it matches \"Omar Burleson\".\n\n3. **Verify the Result**: If the name in the \"incumbent\" column is indeed \"Omar Burleson\" for \"Texas 17\", then the claim is true. Otherwise, it is false.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- **Step 1: Locate Texas 17**  \n  By examining the dataset, we find that there is a row where the value in the \"district\" column is \"texas 17\".\n\n- **Step 2: Check Incumbent Name**  \n  In this row, we look at the \"incumbent\" column and see that it contains \"omar burleson\".\n\n- **Step 3: Verify the Result**  \n  Since the incumbent listed for Texas 17 is indeed Omar Burleson, the claim is true.\n\nHere are the relevant cells from the dataset:\n\n- Row with index 16 (0-based indexing) has:\n  - Column \"district\" with value \"texas 17\"\n  - Column \"incumbent\" with value \"omar burleson\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the row for 'Texas 17' in the dataset.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to evaluate the information provided in the table regarding Paul J. Kilday's election in Texas District 20.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - Locate the row corresponding to \"texas 20\" in the data.\n   - Check the columns for \"incumbent,\" \"first elected,\" and any relevant information that confirms his status as a first-time electee.\n\n2. **Examine the Row for Texas District 20:**\n   - The row with district \"texas 20\" lists:\n     - Incumbent: \"paul j kilday\"\n     - First Elected Year: 1938\n     - Result: \"re-elected\"\n     - Candidates: \"paul j kilday (d) unopposed\"\n\n3. **Interpret the Data:**\n   - The fact that Paul J. Kilday was first elected in 1938 suggests he won his initial election during that year.\n   - Being described as \"unopposed\" implies no other candidates contested against him, which is consistent with a scenario where he could be declared first elected if it was indeed his first term.\n\n4. **Analyze the Claim:**\n   - The claim states: \"paul j kilday be first elect in texas 20 district in 1938.\"\n   - This aligns with the table data indicating that Paul J. Kilday's first election was in 1938, as there were no opponents.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the data from the row for Texas District 20, it is clear that Paul J.
