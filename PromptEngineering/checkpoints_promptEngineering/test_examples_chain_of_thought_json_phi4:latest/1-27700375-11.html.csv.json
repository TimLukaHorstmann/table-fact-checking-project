A win is indicated by \"w\" in the \"score\" column.\n\n3. **Locate the only win**:\n   - According to the data:\n     - Game 77: Scored as \"w 107 - 105 (ot)\" indicates a win.\n     - Location for this game is listed as \"prudential center\".\n\n4. **Check if any other wins exist**:\n   - Review all games in the table:\n     - Games 75, 76, 78, 79, 80, and 81 are losses (\"l\").\n     - Game 77 is the only win.\n\n5. **Verify location of the win**:\n   - The win (Game 77) occurred at \"prudential center\", not at \"air canada centre\".\n\n6. **Conclusion about the claim**:\n   - Since the Nets' only win was at \"prudential center\" and not at \"air canada centre\", the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 5 (Game 77): \n  - Column \"score\": \"w 107 - 105 (ot)\"\n  - Column \"location attendance\": \"prudential center 13461\"\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, we identified all the games played by the Nets and noted their outcomes.
