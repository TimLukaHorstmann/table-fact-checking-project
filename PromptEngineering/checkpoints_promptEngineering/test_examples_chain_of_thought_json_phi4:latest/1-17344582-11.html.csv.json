This indicates that we are looking for an entry in the data where the series is at this score.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Data Row:**\n   - Review each row's \"series\" column to find which one matches the series score \"1 - 1\".\n   - In the table, only the second entry has a series value of \"1 - 1\".\n\n3. **Check the Location Attendance for this Entry:**\n   - For the identified row with series \"1 - 1\", check the \"location attendance\" column.\n   - The location attendance for this game is listed as \"boston garden\".\n\n4. **Verify the Claim Against the Data:**\n   - The claim states that the location attendance for the \"1 - 1\" series score should be \"boston garden\".\n   - From our data examination, we confirmed that when the series was \"1 - 1\", the location was indeed \"boston garden\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is consistent with the information provided in the table.
