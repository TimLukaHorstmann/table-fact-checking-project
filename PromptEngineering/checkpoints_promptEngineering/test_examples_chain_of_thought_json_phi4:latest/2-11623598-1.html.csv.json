    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the last final Bob Carmichael win be in 1978\" is true or false, we need to analyze the provided data for any records involving Bob Carmichael's wins and identify the most recent one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate Entries Involving Bob Carmichael:**\n   - Look through each row of the table to find entries where Bob Carmichael is listed as a \"Winner.\"\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - In the first row, Bob Carmichael is listed as a winner with his partner Owen Davidson in 1965.\n   - The second row lists another win for Bob Carmichael with Owen Davidson in 1970.\n\n3. **Determine the Last Win:**\n   - Compare the years of these wins to find the most recent one. The entries show wins in 1965 and 1970, both involving Bob Carmichael.\n   - No other rows list Bob Carmichael as a winner beyond 1970.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that his last win was in 1978. However, based on the data, his most recent documented win is in 1970.\n   - Therefore, there are no records of a final win by Bob Carmichael in 1978.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the available data, the claim that Bob Carmichael's last win was in 1978 is false.

This indicates they were in the same match, potentially reaching a final together.\n\n3. **Check for Finals**:\n   - We need to determine if any of these matches reached the final stage.
