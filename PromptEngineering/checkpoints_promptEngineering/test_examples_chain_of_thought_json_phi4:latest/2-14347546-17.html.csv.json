    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"only 1 of the Philadelphia Flyers' 7 draft picks came before the 4th round\" is true or false, let's analyze the data step-by-step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understand the Structure**: The table contains information about different players drafted in various rounds. Each entry includes a `round`, `player`, `position`, `nationality`, and their respective team.\n\n2. **Identify the Rounds**: We need to count how many picks were made before the 4th round.
