    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Rice University having the most number of enrolled students and the University of Texas at Austin having the least is true or false, let's follow a step-by-step reasoning process using the provided table data:\n\n1. **Identify Enrollment Data:**\n   - Look for the \"enrollment\" column in the table to find the enrollment numbers for each institution.\n\n2. **Extract Rice University's Enrollment:**\n   - Locate Rice University in the data.\n   - Row 5 (index 4) corresponds to Rice University with an enrollment of 6,799 students.\n\n3. **Extract University of Texas at Austin's Enrollment:**\n   - Locate the University of Texas at Austin in the data.\n   - Row 12 (index 11) corresponds to the University of Texas at Austin with an enrollment of 50,995 students.\n\n4. **Find Maximum and Minimum Enrollment Values:**\n   - Compare all the enrollment numbers to find the maximum and minimum values.\n   - The enrollments are as follows:\n     - Baylor University: 14,769\n     - University of Louisiana at Lafayette: 16,361\n     - Louisiana State University: 25,215\n     - University of North Texas: 36,206\n     - University of Oklahoma: 29,931\n     - Rice University: 6,799\n     - Southern Methodist University: 10,693\n     - Texas A&M University: 48,702\n     - Texas Christian University: 8,696\n     - Texas State University San Marcos: 32,586\n     - Texas Tech University: 30,049\n     - University of Texas at Austin: 50,995\n\n5. **Determine Maximum Enrollment:**\n   - The maximum enrollment is 50,995 students at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\n6. **Determine Minimum Enrollment:**\n   - The minimum enrollment is 6,799 students at Rice University.\n\n7. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Rice University has the most number of enrolled students and the University of Texas at Austin has the least.\n   - Based on our findings:\n     - Rice University does not have the most; it has the least enrollment.\n     - The University of Texas at Austin has the most, not the least.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is FALSE because the enrollment numbers contradict the statement made in the claim.\n\nHere's the final JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Extract the enrollment data for each institution from the table.\",\n    \"Rice University has an enrollment of 6,799 students.\",\n    \"The University of Texas at Austin has an enrollment of 50,995 students.\",\n    \"Compare all enrollment numbers to find the maximum and minimum values.\",\n    \"Maximum enrollment is 50,995 at the University of Texas at Austin.\",\n    \"Minimum enrollment is 6,799 at Rice University.\",\n    \"The claim states Rice University has the most and UT Austin has the least, which contradicts the data.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
