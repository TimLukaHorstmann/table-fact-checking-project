Typically, this would be indicated by a specific label or context not directly provided in the question.\n\n2. **Examine the Data for 2004/05**:\n   - The first column of each row represents the year \"2004 / 05\".\n   - We need to examine each row's entry under this column to find Liu Song's ranking or performance data.\n\n3. **Check All Rows for Consistency and Clues**:\n   - Row 1: Contains numerical values across years, starting with \"90\" for 2004/05.\n   - Subsequent rows contain descriptive terms like \"ranking tournaments\", \"not held\", \"a\", \"lq\", etc., which likely represent different statuses or results rather than rankings.\n\n4. **Determine the Meaning of Symbols**:\n   - \"wr\" typically stands for \"World Ranking\".\n   - \"lq\" could mean \"Lost in Qualifying rounds\".\n   - \"1r\", \"2r\", \"3r\" might indicate progression to 1st, 2nd, or 3rd round respectively.\n   - \"a\" is unclear but often denotes participation or qualification.\n\n5. **Identify the Row with Ranking Information**:\n   - The first row contains numerical values that likely represent rankings.\n   - For the year 2004/05, this value is \"90\".\n\n6. **Verify if This Is Liu Song's Worst Ranking**:\n   - Assuming the first row represents Liu Song's actual ranking across years (since it contains numbers), we need to check if \"90\" is indeed his worst ranking.\n   - Compare \"90\" with other numerical entries in this row for subsequent years: 88, 72, 53, 59, 62, 65. All these values are lower than 90.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since \"90\" is the highest number (indicating the worst ranking) in the first row for Liu Song's performance across the given years, it confirms that his worst ranking was indeed 90th in the season of 2004/05.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table's first row contains numerical values representing rankings.
