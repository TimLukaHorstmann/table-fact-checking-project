    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about West Berkshire Brewery's \"Good Old Boy\" beer not winning a single award between 1995 and 2009 is true or false, we need to examine the table for any entries related to \"Good Old Boy.\" Here's how we can proceed:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Entries**: We will search the \"data\" array in the JSON object for rows where the \"beer name\" column matches \"good old boy.\"\n\n2. **Check Award Wins**:\n   - For each entry with \"good old boy,\" check if there is a non-empty value in the \"prize\" column that indicates an award was won.\n\n3. **List Relevant Data**:\n   - Document any row where \"good old boy\" has received an award, noting the year and prize information.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - If at least one entry exists where \"good old boy\" received a prize between 1995 and 2009, the claim is false.\n   - If no such entries exist, the claim is true.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Scan the Data for \"Good Old Boy\"**:\n   - **Row 0**: The year is 1995, \"beer name\" is \"good old boy,\" and the \"prize\" is \"overall winner.\" This indicates an award was won.\n   - **Row 2**: The year is 2002, \"beer name\" is \"good old boy,\" and the \"prize\" is \"gold medal.\" Another award is indicated here.\n   - **Row 16**: The year is 2005, \"beer name\" is \"good old boy,\" and the \"prize\" is \"silver medal.\" This indicates yet another award.\n\n2. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since \"good old boy\" has multiple entries with awards (\"overall winner\" in 1995, \"gold medal\" in 2002, and \"silver medal\" in 2005), the claim that it did not win any awards between 1995 and 2009 is false.\n\n3. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - Row 0: Year = 1995, Prize = \"overall winner\"\n   - Row 2: Year = 2002, Prize = \"gold medal\"\n   - Row 16: Year = 2005, Prize = \"silver medal\"\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was scanned for entries with 'good old boy' as the beer name.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about West Berkshire Brewery's \"Dr Hexter Healer\" beer receiving only a silver medal between 1995 and 2009 is true or false, let's analyze the data in the provided table step-by-step.\n\n1. **Identify Entries for \"Dr Hexter Healer\":**  \n   We need to locate all entries in the table where the \"beer name\" is either \"dr hexter 's healer\" or \"dr hexter 's wedding ale,\" as these are variations of the same beer's name.\n\n2. **List Relevant Rows:**\n   - 1997: \"dr hexter 's healer\", prize = \"runner up\"\n   - 2002: \"dr hexter 's healer\", prize = \"silver medal\"\n   - 2005: \"dr hexter 's wedding ale\", prize = \"third place\"\n   - 2008: \"dr hexter 's healer\", prize = \"gold medal\"\n   - 2009: \"dr hexter 's healer\", prize = \"gold medal\"\n\n3. **Analyze Prizes:**\n   - In 1997, the beer received a \"runner up\" position.\n   - In 2002, it received a \"silver medal.\"\n   - In 2005, it got a \"third place.\"\n   - In both 2008 and 2009, it received a \"gold medal.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The claim states that \"Dr Hexter Healer\" received only a silver medal between 1995 and 2009.
