    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"4 of the Melbourne Victory record players be active for a total of 2 years\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the data in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim suggests that there are four players who have been active with Melbourne Victory for exactly two years.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Column**: The \"years\" column indicates the duration each player has been active. We need to identify entries where the duration is exactly 2 years.\n\n3. **Parse the \"Years\" Column**:\n   - Entries like \"2008 - 2009\" indicate a span of 2 years.\n   - Entries with two different years (e.g., \"2010 - present\") or a single year (e.g., \"2008\") do not meet the criteria.\n\n4. **Identify Players Active for Exactly 2 Years**:\n   - Laura Alleway: \"2008 - 2009\" (2 years)\n   - Tal Karp: \"2008 - 2009\" (2 years)\n\n5. **Count the Number of Players**: We need to find exactly four players who match this criterion.\n\n6. **Verify Other Entries**:\n   - Check all entries in the table for any other combinations that span exactly two calendar years.\n   - No other entries meet the \"exact 2-year\" requirement based on the given data.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Only two players, Laura Alleway and Tal Karp, have been active for exactly two years.
