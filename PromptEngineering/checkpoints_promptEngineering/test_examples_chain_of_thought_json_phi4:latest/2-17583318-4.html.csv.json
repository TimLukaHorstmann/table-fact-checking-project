Therefore, the claim about Premier League appearances being 44 does not apply to any player.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Michael Dawson: UEFA Cup (10), League Cup (4)\n- Pascal Chimbonda: UEFA Cup (10), League Cup (4)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified players with 10 UEFA Cup appearances: Michael Dawson and Pascal Chimbonda.
