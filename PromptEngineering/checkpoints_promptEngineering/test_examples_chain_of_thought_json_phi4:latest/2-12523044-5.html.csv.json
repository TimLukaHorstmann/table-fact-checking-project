Let\u2019s break down the process step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Claim\n\nThe claim states that there are more players from England than from the United States during the second round. \n\n- **Key Points**:\n  - We need to consider only the second round score.\n  - The table provides total scores over two rounds, so we should focus on the individual round breakdowns.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Player Data\n\nWe will extract relevant data for each player's country and their individual round scores:\n\n1. **Steve Stricker** (United States):\n   - First Round: 70\n   - Second Round: 69\n\n2. **Colin Montgomerie** (Scotland):\n   - First Round: 69\n   - Second Round: 71\n\n3. **Kenneth Ferrie** (England):\n   - First Round: 71\n   - Second Round: 70\n\n4. **Geoff Ogilvy** (Australia):\n   - First Round: 71\n   - Second Round: 70\n\n5. **Jim Furyk** (United States):\n   - First Round: 70\n   - Second Round: 72\n\n6. **P\u00e1draig Harrington** (Ireland):\n   - First Round: 70\n   - Second Round: 72\n\n7. **Jason Dufner** (United States):\n   - First Round: 72\n   - Second Round: 71\n\n8. **Graeme McDowell** (Northern Ireland):\n   - First Round: 71\n   - Second Round: 72\n\n9. **Phil Mickelson** (United States):\n   - First Round: 70\n   - Second Round: 73\n\n10. **Arron Oberholser** (United States):\n    - First Round: 75\n    - Second Round: 68\n\n### Step 3: Count Players by Country for the Second Round\n\nNow, let's count the number of players from each country who played in the second round:\n\n- **England**:\n  - Kenneth Ferrie with a score of 70 in the second round.\n\n- **United States**:\n  - Steve Stricker (69)\n  - Jim Furyk (72)\n  - Jason Dufner (71)\n  - Phil Mickelson (73)\n  - Arron Oberholser (68)\n\nFrom this breakdown, we see:\n\n- There is 1 player from England.\n- There are 5 players from the United States.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nThe claim that there are more players from England than from the United States during the second round is false.
