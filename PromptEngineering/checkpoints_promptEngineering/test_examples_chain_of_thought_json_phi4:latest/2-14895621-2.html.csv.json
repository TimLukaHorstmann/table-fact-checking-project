    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng 3 time at tournament\" is true or false, let's analyze the table step by step.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - The column of interest for determining partnerships is \"partner\". We need to check if \"kang haeng-suk\" appears as a partner in any row and if so, how many times.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row for the Partner Name:**\n   - We will go through each row to see where \"kang haeng-suk\" appears under the \"partner\" column.\n\n3. **Row Analysis:**\n   - **Row 0:** The partner is listed as \"world championships\". This does not specify an individual, so it's irrelevant.\n   - **Row 1:** The partner is \"kang haeng-suk\".\n   - **Row 2:** The partner is listed as \"asian games\". This does not specify an individual, so it's irrelevant.\n   - **Row 3:** The partner is \"kang haeng-suk\".\n   - **Row 4:** The partner is listed as \"other open tournaments\". This does not specify an individual, so it's irrelevant.\n   - **Row 5:** The partner is \"kang haeng-suk\".\n\n4. **Count the Occurrences:**\n   - \"kang haeng-suk\" appears as a partner in rows 1, 3, and 5.\n\n5. **Verify Total Count:**\n   - There are three occurrences of \"kang haeng-suk\" being listed as a partner.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng-Suk three times at tournaments. Based on the data, this is true since \"kang haeng-suk\" appears as a partner in three rows.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The 'partner' column was examined to find occurrences of 'kang haeng-suk'.

Thus, we cannot confirm this part based on the table.\n\n#### Part 3: \"finish second\"\n- To verify if Hwang Sun finished second, we need a result showing her finishing second.\n- In the table, there is no entry for an Asian Games event in 1985 or any indication of Hwang Sun finishing second. The only result mentioned is \"1\" (first place) and \"wd\" (withdrawn).\n\n#### Part 4: \"2 of 3 time she win an event with kang haeng\"\n- We need to count the number of times Hwang Sun won events with Kang Haeng-Suk.\n- From the table:\n  - In 1985, at the World Championships and India Open, there are entries showing a result of \"1\" (first place) with Kang Haeng-Suk as the partner. This accounts for two wins.\n  - There is no third entry where Hwang Sun won an event with Kang Haeng-Suk.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Part 1**: No evidence in the table supports participation in the Asian Games in 1985.\n- **Part 2 and Part 3**: The specific event type and result are not detailed in the table.\n- **Part 4**: Only two wins are recorded with Kang Haeng-Suk, not three.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The table does not have an entry for Hwang Sun participating in the Asian Games in 1985.\",\n    \"There is no specific mention of a 'double women's doubles' event or finishing second in the table.\",\n    \"No result indicates Hwang Sun finished second in any event.\",\n    \"Hwang Sun only has two recorded wins with Kang Haeng-Suk, not three.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

This implies they did not finish first.\n\n### Step 3: Check Partnership with Hwang Sun\n- The table does not explicitly mention Hwang Sun. It only lists Kang Haeng Suk as the partner in Row 3.\n- Therefore, we cannot confirm from this data that Hwang Sun was the partner.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the World Championship Win Two Years Prior\n- We need to find a World Championship win for Kang Haeng Suk two years before 1982 (i.e., in 1980).\n- The relevant rows for \"world championships\" are Rows 1 and 2.\n- Row 2 shows:\n  - Year: 1985\n  - Outcome: 3\n- There is no record of a World Championship win in 1980.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Partnership with Hwang Sun**: Not confirmed from the data.\n- **Winning the 1982 New Delhi event**: They did not finish first (they withdrew).\n- **World Championship Win Two Years Prior**: No such win exists for 1980.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
