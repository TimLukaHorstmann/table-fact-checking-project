Home did not win.\n  - Row 3 (Princes Park): Home score 76, Away score 80. Home did not win.\n  - Row 4 (Punt Road Oval): Home score 78, Away score 94. Home did not win.\n  - Row 5 (Arden Street Oval): Scores are tied. Home did not win.\n  - Row 6 (Junction Oval): Home score 92, Away score 69. Home won.\n\n- **Count Venues**:\n  - Kardinia Park: Home team won.\n  - Junction Oval: Home team won.\n  - Total venues where the home team scored more than the away team: 2.\n\nSince only two venues (Kardinia Park and Junction Oval) meet the criteria, not three, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
