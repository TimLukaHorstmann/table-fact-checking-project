    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"Ferrari be the constructor of 3 of the cars driven in the race\" is true, we need to examine the table data for any entries where Ferrari is listed as the constructor.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: \n   - The relevant column that lists constructors is named \"constructor\".\n\n2. **Check Entries for Ferrari**:\n   - We will go through each entry in the \"data\" list and check if \"ferrari\" appears as a constructor.\n\n3. **Count Ferrari Instances**:\n   - Michele Alboreto: Row 4, Constructor = \"ferrari\"\n   - Stefan Johansson: Row 5, Constructor = \"ferrari\"\n   - No other rows list \"ferrari\" as the constructor.\n\n4. **Count Total**:\n   - There are exactly two instances where Ferrari is listed as the constructor.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that Ferrari was the constructor for three cars, but our examination shows only two instances. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Checked each row in the 'data' list for entries where 'ferrari' appears as a constructor. Found two such instances: Michele Alboreto and Stefan Johansson.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
