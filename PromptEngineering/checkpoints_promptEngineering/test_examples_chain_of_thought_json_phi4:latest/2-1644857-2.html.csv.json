    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze two parts of it:\n\n1. Scotland has stolen ends less than 9.\n2. Craig Brown is the skip for the United States.\n\nLet's break down the steps to verify these claims using the provided table data:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Row for Scotland:**\n   - Look for the row where \"country\" is \"scotland\".\n   - In this case, it corresponds to the second entry in the data:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 1,\n       \"column_name\": \"stolen ends\",\n       \"value\": 10\n     }\n     ```\n   - The number of stolen ends for Scotland is 10.\n\n2. **Verify if Stolen Ends are Less Than 9:**\n   - Compare the value from step 1 with 9.\n   - Since 10 is not less than 9, this part of the claim is false.\n\n3. **Identify the Row for Craig Brown:**\n   - Look for the row where \"skip\" is \"craig brown\".\n   - This corresponds to the seventh entry in the data:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 6,\n       \"column_name\": \"country\",\n       \"value\": \"united states\"\n     }\n     ```\n\n4. **Verify if Craig Brown is Skip for United States:**\n   - Check if the country associated with Craig Brown is indeed \"United States\".\n   - The data confirms that Craig Brown is the skip for the United States.\n\n5. **Conclusion on the Overall Claim:**\n   - For the claim to be true, both parts need to be true.\n   - Since the first part of the claim (Scotland having stolen ends less than 9) is false, the entire claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells that were used in this analysis are:\n- The cell for Scotland's stolen ends: \n  ```json\n  { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"stolen ends\", \"value\": 10 }\n  ```\n- The cell identifying Craig Brown as the skip for the United States:\n  ```json\n  { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"country\", \"value\": \"united states\" }\n  ```\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate Scotland in the table and check its stolen ends count. It is 10, which is not less than 9, making this part of the claim false. Next, verify that Craig Brown is listed as the skip for the United States, which is true. Since one part of the claim is false, the entire claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"stolen ends\", \"value\": 10 },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"country\", \"value\": \"united states\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
