    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Mission Veterans Memorial be the AA class with Lindsay\" is true or false, we need to analyze the data provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Columns:**\n   - We are interested in the columns labeled \"school year,\" \"class aa,\" and any column that mentions \"Lindsay.\"\n\n2. **Locate Rows with \"Lindsay\":**\n   - Look through the first column (\"school year\") to find rows where \"Lindsay\" is listed under any of the class columns.\n\n3. **Check Corresponding \"Class AA\" Values:**\n   - For each row where \"Lindsay\" appears, check what value is listed in the \"class aa\" column for that same row.\n\n4. **Analyze Each Occurrence:**\n\n   - **Row 8 (1997-98):** \n     - Class A: Rule\n     - Class AA: Plains\n     - Class AAA: Santa Rosa\n     - Class AAAA: Azle\n     - Class AAAAA: Klein\n     - \"Lindsay\" does not appear here.\n\n   - **Row 19 (2008-09):**\n     - School Year: 2008-09\n     - Class A: Lindsay\n     - Class AA: Elkhart\n     - Class AAA: Argyle\n     - Class AAAA: Longview Pine Tree\n     - Class AAAAA: Klein\n     - \"Lindsay\" is in Class A, not Class AA. The Class AA here is \"Elkhart.\"\n\n   - **Row 20 (2009-10):**\n     - School Year: 2009-10\n     - Class A: Poolville\n     - Class AA: Paris Chisum\n     - Class AAA: Argyle\n     - Class AAAA: Mission Veterans Memorial\n     - Class AAAAA: Galena Park North Shore\n     - \"Lindsay\" does not appear here.\n\n   - **Row 21 (2010-11):**\n     - School Year: 2010-11\n     - Class A: Lindsay\n     - Class AA: Elkhart\n     - Class AAA: Argyle\n     - Class AAAA: Mission Veterans Memorial\n     - Class AAAAA: Galena Park North Shore\n     - \"Lindsay\" is in Class A, not Class AA. The Class AA here is \"Elkhart.\"\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - In both instances where \"Lindsay\" appears (rows 19 and 21), the corresponding value in the \"class aa\" column is not \"Mission Veterans Memorial.\" Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows where 'Lindsay' appears.\",\n    \"Check the 'Class AA' values for these rows.\",\n    \"In both instances (rows 19 and 21), 'Mission Veterans Memorial' does not appear in the 'Class AA' column when 'Lindsay' is present.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"school year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"class a\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"class aa\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"school year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"class a\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"class aa\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
