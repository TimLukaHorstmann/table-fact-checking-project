    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Michael Lembeck directed series number 39, fly solo\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant parts of the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Series Number**: The claim refers to \"series number 39\". We will look for an entry in the data where the `series` column equals 39.\n\n2. **Verify Director**: According to the claim, Michael Lembeck directed this series. We need to check if the `directed by :` field matches \"michael lembeck\" for the entry with `series = 39`.\n\n3. **Check Title**: The claim also mentions the title as \"fly solo\". We must ensure that the `title` column contains \"flying solo\" (considering potential variations in phrasing).\n\n4. **Locate Relevant Entry**:\n   - Look through each row to find where `series = 39`.\n   - Verify if `directed by :` is \"michael lembeck\".\n   - Confirm that the title matches or closely resembles \"fly solo\".\n\n### Examination of Table:\n\n- Locate the row with `series = 39`. From the data:\n  ```json\n  [\n    39,\n    13,\n    \"flying solo\",\n    \"michael lembeck\",\n    \"leslie rieder\",\n    \"january 7 , 1991\"\n  ]\n  ```\n\n- **Director Check**: The `directed by :` field is \"michael lembeck\", which matches the claim.\n\n- **Title Check**: The `title` is \"flying solo\". This closely matches \"fly solo\" mentioned in the claim, considering common variations in phrasing (such as dropping the article \"the\").\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe entry for series number 39 meets all criteria specified in the claim: it was directed by Michael Lembeck and titled \"flying solo\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the row with series number 39. Verify if 'michael lembeck' is listed as the director and check the title to ensure it matches or closely resembles 'fly solo'. The entry for series 39 confirms that Michael Lembeck directed it and the title is 'flying solo', which aligns with 'fly solo'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"directed by :\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"series number 39 be write by michael lembeck\" is true or false, we need to evaluate the specific details from the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Series Number**: The claim concerns series number 39.\n   \n2. **Locate Series Data**:\n   - In the JSON data, each entry in the \"data\" list corresponds to a row of information for a particular episode or series.\n   - We need to find the entry where the first element (series) is 39.\n\n3. **Extract Relevant Information**:\n   - Once we locate the correct row, extract the values for the columns: `directed by :` and `written by :`.\n   \n4. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that \"michael lembeck\" wrote series number 39.\n   - We need to check if \"michael lembeck\" is listed in the `written by :` column for series number 39.\n\n5. **Analyze the Extracted Data**:\n   - For series number 39, the data row is: `[39, 13, \"flying solo\", \"michael lembeck\", \"leslie rieder\", \"january 7 , 1991\"]`.\n   - Here, `directed by :` is \"michael lembeck\" and `written by :` is \"leslie rieder\".\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since \"michael lembeck\" is not listed in the `written by :` column for series number 39 (it lists \"leslie rieder\"), the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim concerns series number 39. Upon examining the data, series number 39 corresponds to the row with 'directed by :' as 'michael lembeck' and 'written by :' as 'leslie rieder'.
