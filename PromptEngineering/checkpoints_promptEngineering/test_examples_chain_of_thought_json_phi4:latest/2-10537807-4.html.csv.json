    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the number of song releases by Doves increases every year\" is true or false, we need to analyze the data in the provided table with respect to the release years for each song.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We focus on the \"release date\" column to determine the year of each song's release.\n   \n2. **Extract Yearly Release Data:**\n   - For each entry, extract the year from the \"release date\":\n     - \"here it comes\": 1999\n     - \"the cedar room\": 2000\n     - \"catch the sun\": 2000\n     - \"the man who told everything\": 2000\n     - \"there goes the fear\": 2002\n     - \"pounding\": 2002\n     - \"caught by the river\": 2002\n     - \"black and white town\": 2005\n     - \"snowden\": 2005\n     - \"sky starts falling\": 2005\n     - \"kingdom of rust\": 2009\n     - \"winter hill\": 2009\n     - \"andalucia\": 2010\n\n3. **Count Releases Per Year:**\n   - Count the number of releases for each year:\n     - 1999: 1 release (\"here it comes\")\n     - 2000: 3 releases (\"the cedar room\", \"catch the sun\", \"the man who told everything\")\n     - 2002: 3 releases (\"there goes the fear\", \"pounding\", \"caught by the river\")\n     - 2005: 3 releases (\"black and white town\", \"snowden\", \"sky starts falling\")\n     - 2009: 2 releases (\"kingdom of rust\", \"winter hill\")\n     - 2010: 1 release (\"andalucia\")\n\n4. **Compare Yearly Counts:**\n   - Analyze the pattern in counts from year to year:\n     - From 1999 to 2000, the number increases (1 \u2192 3).\n     - From 2000 to 2002, the count remains stable (3 \u2192 3).\n     - From 2002 to 2005, the count remains stable (3 \u2192 3).\n     - From 2005 to 2009, the number decreases (3 \u2192 2).\n     - From 2009 to 2010, the number decreases further (2 \u2192 1).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of releases does not increase every year; it remains stable or decreases in several years.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The release dates were extracted and organized by year.
