We need to find all entries in the table where this score appears.\n\n2. **Locate Matches with Score \"0 - 4\"**:\n   - Examine each row in the \"data\" array to check if the \"score\" column contains \"0 - 4\".\n   - The first entry has a date of \"may 24\", visitor \"pittsburgh\", score \"0 - 4\", home \"detroit\", decision \"osgood\", attendance 20066, and series \"1 - 0\". This matches our criteria.\n\n3. **Check Attendance for the Identified Match**:\n   - The attendance for this match is 20066.\n   - We need to ensure there are no other entries with a score of \"0 - 4\" that have a higher attendance than 20066.\n\n4. **Verify Uniqueness or Highest Attendance**:\n   - Scan through all the rows again to confirm if any other row has a score of \"0 - 4\".\n   - No other entry in the data array has the score \"0 - 4\".\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since only one match with a score of \"0 - 4\" exists and its attendance is 20066, this is indeed the highest (and only) attendance for such a match.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim that \"the highest attendance for a match with a score of 0 - 4 be 20066\" is TRUE.
