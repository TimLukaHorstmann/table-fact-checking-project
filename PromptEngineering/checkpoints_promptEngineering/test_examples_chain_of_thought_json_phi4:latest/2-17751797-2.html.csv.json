    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to verify two things: \n\n1. Identify the highest score by a team in a single game from the provided data.\n2. Confirm if Woking scored 5 points in that particular match.\n\nLet's go through the table step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Each Row for Scores\nWe will look at each row under the \"score\" column to identify the highest score achieved by any team.\n\n- **Row 1**: Chesterfield vs. Bolton Wanderers, Score: 3 - 4\n  - Highest score here is 4 (Bolton Wanderers).\n\n- **Row 2**: Bournemouth vs. Hayes, Score: 1 - 0\n  - Highest score here is 1 (Bournemouth).\n\n- **Row 3**: Barnet vs. Northampton Town, Score: 0 - 0\n  - No goals scored.\n\n- **Replay Row**: Northampton Town vs. Barnet, Score: 0 - 1\n  - Highest score here is 1 (Barnet).\n\n- **Row 4**: Burnley vs. Stoke City, Score: 2 - 0\n  - Highest score here is 2 (Burnley).\n\n- **Row 5**: Woking vs. Merthyr Tydfil, Score: 5 - 1\n  - Highest score here is 5 (Woking).\n\n- **Row 6**: Crewe Alexandra vs. Atherstone United, Score: 1 - 0\n  - Highest score here is 1 (Crewe Alexandra).\n\n- **Row 7**: Shrewsbury Town vs. Chorley, Score: 1 - 0\n  - Highest score here is 1 (Shrewsbury Town).\n\n- **Row 8**: Wycombe Wanderers vs. Peterborough United, Score: 1 - 1\n  - Highest score here is 1 (Both teams).\n\n- **Replay Row**: Peterborough United vs. Wycombe Wanderers, Score: 2 - 0\n  - Highest score here is 2 (Peterborough United).\n\n- **Row 9**: Fulham vs. Cambridge United, Score: 0 - 0\n  - No goals scored.\n\n- **Replay Row**: Cambridge United vs. Fulham, Score: 2 - 1\n  - Highest score here is 2 (Cambridge United).\n\n- **Row 10**: Whitley Bay vs. Barrow, Score: 0 - 1\n  - Highest score here is 1 (Barrow).\n\n- **Row 11**: Scunthorpe United vs. Tranmere Rovers, Score: 3 - 2\n  - Highest score here is 3 (Scunthorpe United).\n\n- **Row 12**: Huddersfield Town vs. Blackpool, Score: 0 - 2\n  - Highest score here is 2 (Blackpool).\n\n- **Row 13**: Mansfield Town vs. York City, Score: 2 - 1\n  - Highest score here is 2 (Mansfield Town).\n\n- **Row 14**: Rotherham United vs. Halifax Town, Score: 1 - 1\n  - Highest score here is 1 (Both teams).\n\n- **Replay Row**: Halifax Town vs. Rotherham United, Score: 1 - 2\n  - Highest score here is 2 (Rotherham United).\n\n- **Row 15**: Aldershot vs. Maidstone United, Score: 2 - 1\n  - Highest score here is 2 (Aldershot).\n\n- **Row 16**: Wigan Athletic vs. Hartlepool United, Score: 2 - 0\n  - Highest score here is 2 (Wigan Athletic).\n\n- **Row 17**: Colchester United vs. Leyton Orient, Score: 0 - 0\n  - No goals scored.\n\n- **Replay Row**: Chester City vs. Leek Town, Score: 4 - 0\n  - Highest score here is 4 (Chester City).\n\n- **Row 20**: Swansea City vs. Walsall, Score: 2 - 1\n  - Highest score here is 2 (Swansea City).\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Maximum Score and Verify the Team\nFrom the analysis above:\n- The highest score by any team in a single game is indeed **5**, achieved by Woking against Merthyr Tydfil.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim that \"the most point score by a team in a single game be 5, by Woking\" is correct based on the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Analyzed each row to find the highest score in any match.
