    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Toronto Blue Jay plays Angel on April 29\" is true or false, we need to examine the provided table for any relevant information related to the date \"April 29\". Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Date**: We are looking specifically at the data entry corresponding to \"april 29\".\n\n2. **Locate April 29 in the Table**:\n   - The table has a column named \"date\" where we can find entries for each game.\n   - Locate the row with the date \"april 29\". This is the last entry in the \"data\" array of the JSON object.\n\n3. **Examine the Details for April 29**:\n   - Check the \"opponent\" column for this date to see which team was scheduled to play against.\n   - The relevant cell for \"date\" is \"april 29\", and the corresponding entry in the \"opponent\" column is \"royals\".\n\n4. **Assess the Claim Against Table Data**:\n   - The claim states that the Toronto Blue Jays are playing against the Angels on April 29.\n   - According to the table, the game scheduled for April 29 was between the team (presumably the one recording these games) and the \"royals\", not the \"angels\".\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the opponent listed is \"royals\" and not \"angels\", the claim that \"Toronto Blue Jay plays Angel on April 29\" is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells for verifying this claim are in row index 18 (since JSON arrays are zero-indexed) with column names \"date\" and \"opponent\".\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table entry for April 29 lists 'royals' as the opponent, not 'angels'.
