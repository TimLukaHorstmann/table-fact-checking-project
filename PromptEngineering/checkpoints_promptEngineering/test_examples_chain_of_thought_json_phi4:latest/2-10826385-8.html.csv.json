Let's examine the relevant data from the table for each venue.\n\n1. **VFL Park**:\n   - Look at the entry where the \"venue\" is \"vfl park\".\n   - Identify the corresponding \"crowd\" value.\n   - From the data: \n     - Venue: VFL Park, Crowd: 25845\n   - Since 25,845 is greater than 20,000, this venue does not meet the condition.\n\n2. **Lake Oval**:\n   - Look at the entry where the \"venue\" is \"lake oval\".\n   - Identify the corresponding \"crowd\" value.\n   - From the data: \n     - Venue: Lake Oval, Crowd: 12421\n   - Since 12,421 is less than 20,000, this venue meets the condition.\n\n3. **Arden Street Oval**:\n   - Look at the entry where the \"venue\" is \"arden street oval\".\n   - Identify the corresponding \"crowd\" value.\n   - From the data: \n     - Venue: Arden Street Oval, Crowd: 14091\n   - Since 14,091 is less than 20,000, this venue meets the condition.\n\nThe claim requires that all three venues have a crowd of less than 20,000. However, VFL Park does not meet this requirement as its crowd size is 25,845, which exceeds 20,000. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify each venue mentioned in the claim: VFL Park, Lake Oval, and Arden Street Oval.
