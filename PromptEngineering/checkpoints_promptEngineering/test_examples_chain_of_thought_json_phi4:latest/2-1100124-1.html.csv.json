    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"66101 be the highest attendance in the world series\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the provided table data for attendance figures:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - The column of interest here is \"attendance,\" which contains numerical values representing the number of people who attended each game.\n\n2. **Extract Attendance Values:**\n   - Game 1: 30805\n   - Game 2: 30805\n   - Game 3: 67101\n   - Game 4: 66312\n   - Game 5: 65633\n   - Game 6: 30805\n   - Game 7: 30346\n\n3. **Analyze the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"66101 be the highest attendance in the world series.\"\n   - We need to check if any attendance figure is higher than 66101.\n\n4. **Compare Attendance Figures:**\n   - Compare each attendance value with 66101:\n     - Game 1 (30805) < 66101\n     - Game 2 (30805) < 66101\n     - Game 3 (67101) > 66101\n     - Game 4 (66312) > 66101\n     - Game 5 (65633) < 66101\n     - Game 6 (30805) < 66101\n     - Game 7 (30346) < 66101\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The highest attendance recorded in the table is 67101, which occurs on October 10 at Yankee Stadium.\n   - Therefore, the claim that \"66101 be the highest attendance\" is FALSE because there are higher attendance figures.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Game 3 (row index 2): Attendance of 67101\n- Game 4 (row index 3): Attendance of 66312\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the 'attendance' column as relevant.\",\n    \"Extract attendance figures: 30805, 30805, 67101, 66312, 65633, 30805, 30346.\",\n    \"Compare each value with 66101 to check if it is higher.\",\n    \"Find that 67101 and 66312 are greater than 66101.\",\n    \"Conclude the claim is FALSE as there are higher attendance figures.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Busch Stadium (I) be the location in 3 of the 7 games in October\" is true or false, we need to analyze the data provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Total Number of Games:**\n   - The table lists a total of 7 games (from row index 0 to 6).\n\n2. **Locate Column for Game Location:**\n   - The column name \"location\" indicates where each game was played.\n\n3. **Count the Occurrences of Busch Stadium (I):**\n   - We need to count how many times \"Busch Stadium (I)\" appears in the \"location\" column across all rows.\n   \n4. **Examine Each Row:**\n   - **Row 0:** Location is \"busch stadium (i)\".\n   - **Row 1:** Location is \"busch stadium (i)\".\n   - **Row 2:** Location is \"yankee stadium (i)\".\n   - **Row 3:** Location is \"yankee stadium (i)\".\n   - **Row 4:** Location is \"yankee stadium (i)\".\n   - **Row 5:** Location is \"busch stadium (i)\".\n   - **Row 6:** Location is \"busch stadium (i)\".\n\n5. **Count the Total Occurrences:**\n   - \"Busch Stadium (I)\" appears in rows 0, 1, 5, and 6.
