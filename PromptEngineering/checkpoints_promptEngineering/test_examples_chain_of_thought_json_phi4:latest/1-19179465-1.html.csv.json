    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Featherstone Rovers having 1 drawn game out of 18 is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Team:**\n   - The claim mentions \"Featherstone Rover.\" From the table, the team name is spelled as \"featherstone rovers.\"\n\n2. **Locate the Row for Featherstone Rovers:**\n   - We need to find the row in the data that corresponds to \"featherstone rovers.\"\n   - By examining each row's club name, we identify that Featherstone Rovers are listed in the 8th row.\n\n3. **Check the 'Drawn' Column:**\n   - Once we locate the correct row (row index 7, as indexing starts from 0), we look at the \"drawn\" column to see how many drawn games they have.\n   - The value in the \"drawn\" column for Featherstone Rovers is 1.\n\n4. **Verify the Total Played Games:**\n   - Confirm that the total number of games played by Featherstone Rovers matches the claim's context, which states \"out of 18.\"\n   - In the same row (row index 7), the \"played\" column shows 18 games.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Featherstone Rovers have played 18 games and have 1 drawn game, the claim is accurate.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified 'featherstone rovers' in the table at row index 7.
