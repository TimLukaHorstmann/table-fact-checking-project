Let's go through each component of the claim step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Venue**: The claim states that the event took place at \"mcg\". We will check which row(s) have \"mcg\" as the venue.\n\n2. **Verify the Away Team**: According to the claim, the away team is \"footscray\". We need to confirm that in the identified row from step 1, \"footscray\" is listed as the away team.\n\n3. **Check the Away Team's Score**: The claim specifies that footscray scored \"10.11 (71)\". We must ensure this score matches the away team's score in the identified row from step 1.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the data provided:\n\n- **Step 1: Identify the Venue**\n  - Look for rows where the venue is \"mcg\". From the table, we find:\n    - Row 4: [\"melbourne\", \"13.9 (87)\", \"footscray\", \"10.11 (71)\", \"mcg\", 20244, \"30 may 1931\"]\n\n- **Step 2: Verify the Away Team**\n  - In row 4, the away team is listed as \"footscray\". This matches the claim.\n\n- **Step 3: Check the Away Team's Score**\n  - In row 4, the score for footscray (away team) is \"10.11 (71)\". This also matches the claim.\n\nSince all components of the claim are verified and match the data in the table:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows where the venue is 'mcg'.\",\n    \"In row 4, the venue is 'mcg'.\",\n    \"Verify that the away team in this row is 'footscray'.\",\n    \"In row 4, the away team is indeed 'footscray'.\",\n    \"Check if the score for footscray (away team) matches '10.11 (71)' in this row.\",\n    \"In row 4, the score for footscray is '10.11 (71)', which matches the claim.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
