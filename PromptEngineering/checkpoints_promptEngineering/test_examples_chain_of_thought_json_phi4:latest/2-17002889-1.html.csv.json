    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"model 14sq have an overall length of 4.5 m\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data specifically for the model named \"14sq\". Here's a step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify the Model in the Data:**\n   - The model in question is \"14sq\".\n  \n2. **Locate the Row Corresponding to the Model:**\n   - We need to find the row where the column \"model\" contains \"14sq\".\n\n3. **Check the Length Over All for the Model:**\n   - Once we have identified the correct row, we examine the value in the \"length over all\" column for this model.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim Against the Data:**\n   - The claim states that the overall length is \"4.5 m\".\n   - We need to confirm if the value under the \"length over all\" column matches this statement.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps using the provided table data:\n\n- **Step 1:** Locate the row with model name \"14sq\".
