    "resp": "To determine if the claim about the average attendance for games played in May at the Eternal Derby (Croatia) being 22,666 is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Games**: We first identify all games that took place in the month of May.\n2. **Filter by Location**: From those games, filter out only the ones played at either \"maksimir\" or \"poljud\", as these are the locations for the Eternal Derby.\n3. **Calculate Average Attendance**: Calculate the average attendance of these filtered games.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Relevant Games\n\nWe need to find all entries where the month is May. This corresponds to dates like \"13 may 2006\", \"28 may 2009\", etc.\n\nFrom the data, we extract:\n- Row 22: Date \"13 may 2006\", Ground \"maksimir\"\n- Row 36: Date \"7 may 2008\", Ground \"maksimir\"\n- Row 37: Date \"14 may 2008\", Ground \"poljud\"\n- Row 38: Date \"21 sep 2008\" (not relevant)\n- Row 46: Date \"13 may 2009\", Ground \"maksimir\"\n- Row 47: Date \"28 may 2009\", Ground \"poljud\"\n- Row 48: Date \"31 may 2009\", Ground \"poljud\"\n- Row 57: Date \"1 may 2010\", Ground \"maksimir\"\n\n### Step 2: Filter by Location\n\nFrom the above list, we filter out games played at \"maksimir\" or \"poljud\":\n- Row 22: \"13 may 2006\", Ground \"maksimir\"\n- Row 36: \"7 may 2008\", Ground \"maksimir\"\n- Row 37: \"14 may 2008\", Ground \"poljud\"\n- Row 46: \"13 may 2009\", Ground \"maksimir\"\n- Row 47: \"28 may 2009\", Ground \"poljud\"\n- Row 48: \"31 may 2009\", Ground \"poljud\"\n- Row 57: \"1 may 2010\", Ground \"maksimir\"\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Average Attendance\n\nNow, calculate the average attendance for these games:\n- Row 22: Attendance = 30,000\n- Row 36: Attendance = 15,000\n- Row 37: Attendance = 6,000\n- Row 46: Attendance = 20,000\n- Row 47: Attendance = 18,000\n- Row 48: Attendance = 10,000\n- Row 57: Attendance = 13,000\n\nSum of attendances = 30,000 + 15,000 + 6,000 + 20,000 + 18,000 + 10,000 + 13,000 = 112,000\n\nNumber of games = 7\n\nAverage attendance = 112,000 / 7 \u2248 16,000\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated average attendance for May matches is approximately 16,000, not 22,666.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
