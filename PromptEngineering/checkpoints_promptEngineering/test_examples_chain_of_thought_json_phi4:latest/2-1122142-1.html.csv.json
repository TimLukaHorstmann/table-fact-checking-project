    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, let's break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. **Driver**: The claim states \"cesare perdisa\". We need to find a row where the driver is \"cesare perdisa\".\n\n2. **Constructor**: According to the claim, the constructor should be \"brm\". We will check if the constructor in the identified row matches this.\n\n3. **Time / Retired**: The claim specifies \"+ 6 laps\" as the time/retire status. This needs to match with what's found for \"cesare perdisa\".\n\n4. **Grid Position**: Finally, the grid position is claimed to be 18. We need to check if this matches in the row where \"cesare perdisa\" is listed.\n\nNow, let's go through the table to verify these points:\n\n- Look for a row with \"driver\" as \"cesare perdisa\".\n  \n  - In row index 6:\n    - Driver: \"cesare perdisa\"\n    - Constructor: \"maserati\"\n    - Time / Retired: \"+ 6 laps\"\n    - Grid: 15\n\n- Check the constructor for \"cesare perdisa\".

It is listed as 15, not 18.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The constructor does not match (\"maserati\" instead of \"brm\").\n- The grid position does not match (15 instead of 18).\n\nThus, the claim is false.
