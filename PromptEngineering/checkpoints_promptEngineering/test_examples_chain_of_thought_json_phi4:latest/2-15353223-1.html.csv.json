    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim, we need to compare the rounds in which Chris Walsh and Barry Rose were picked.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant rows:**\n   - Locate the row containing \"Chris Walsh.\"\n   - Locate the row containing \"Barry Rose.\"\n\n2. **Extract round information:**\n   - For Chris Walsh:\n     - Find his corresponding \"round\" value from the table.\n   - For Barry Rose:\n     - Find his corresponding \"round\" value from the table.\n\n3. **Compare the rounds:**\n   - Determine if Chris Walsh was picked in an earlier round than Barry Rose.\n\n4. **Analyze the claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"Chris Walsh be include in an earlier round than Barry Rose.\"\n   - If Chris Walsh's round number is less than Barry Rose's, then the claim is true.\n   - Otherwise, it is false.\n\n### Extracting Information from Table:\n\n- **Chris Walsh**:\n  - From the table, locate Chris Walsh at row index 8. His \"round\" value is 9.\n\n- **Barry Rose**:\n  - From the table, locate Barry Rose at row index 9. His \"round\" value is 10.\n\n### Comparison and Conclusion:\n\n- Chris Walsh was picked in round 9.\n- Barry Rose was picked in round 10.\n- Since 9 (Chris Walsh's round) is less than 10 (Barry Rose's round), Chris Walsh was indeed included in an earlier round than Barry Rose.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate Chris Walsh and Barry Rose in the table. Chris Walsh is picked in round 9, while Barry Rose is picked in round 10. Since 9 is less than 10, Chris Walsh was included in an earlier round than Barry Rose.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
