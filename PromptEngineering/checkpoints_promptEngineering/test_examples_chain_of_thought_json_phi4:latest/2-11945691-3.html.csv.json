    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true, we need to evaluate several aspects:\n\n1. **Identify the Date**: The claim refers to a game on November 22. We need to find this date in the \"date\" column of the table.\n\n2. **Determine if it's a Home Game for Colorado**: Once we locate the row with November 22, we should check the \"visitor\" column. If Colorado is listed as the visitor, then it was an away game. The claim states that Colorado recorded a home loss, so they must be in the \"home\" position.\n\n3. **Check if Colorado Lost the Game**: For the game on November 22, we need to verify if Colorado lost. This can be determined by looking at the \"score\" column: if Colorado's score is less than their opponent's, then it was a loss.\n\n4. **Count Home Losses**: Finally, we need to count how many home losses Colorado had up to and including November 22. We will examine all rows where Colorado is listed as \"home\" and check the scores for any losses.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. **Find the Row for November 22**:\n   - The row with date \"november 22\" shows:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"date\": \"november 22\",\n       \"visitor\": \"chicago\",\n       \"score\": \"2 - 6\",\n       \"home\": \"colorado\",\n       \"record\": \"14 - 4 - 3\"\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Verify it's a Home Game**:\n   - The \"home\" column for November 22 is \"colorado\", confirming it was a home game.\n\n3. **Check if Colorado Lost the Game**:\n   - The score \"2 - 6\" indicates that Colorado scored 2 goals and Chicago scored 6, so Colorado lost this game.\n\n4. **Count Home Losses up to November 22**:\n   - We need to check all rows where \"home\" is \"colorado\" and count the losses (where Colorado's score is less than their opponent's):\n     - November 3: Score \"5 - 2\", win for Colorado.\n     - November 5: Score \"7 - 3\", win for Colorado.\n     - November 9: Score \"1 - 1\", draw.\n     - November 11: Score \"8 - 4\", win for Colorado.\n     - November 15: Score \"3 - 7\", loss for Colorado (1st home loss).\n     - November 17: Score \"5 - 3\", win for Colorado.\n     - November 18: Score \"2 - 5\", not a home game.\n     - November 20: Score \"3 - 3\", draw.\n     - November 22: Score \"2 - 6\", loss for Colorado (2nd home loss).\n   - Up to and including November 22, Colorado has recorded only 2 home losses.\n\nThe claim states that this was the 3rd home loss, but our count shows it was the 2nd. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Locate the row for November 22. \\n2. Verify Colorado is listed as 'home'. \\n3.

This is a tie.\n   - November 25, 1995: Colorado vs. Montreal with a score of \"2 - 2\".
