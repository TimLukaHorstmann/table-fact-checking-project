Here\u2019s how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Identify the Year**: The claim specifies the year as 1995.\n2. **Locate the Artist**: We need to find the row corresponding to the artist \"Robson & Jerome\".\n3. **Verify the Album Title**: Once we locate the row for \"Robson & Jerome\", check if the album title matches \"Robson & Jerome\".\n\nLet's follow these steps using the provided table:\n\n- The column headers are: `year`, `artist`, `album`, `record label`, and `weeks at number one`.\n- We need to find a row where the `year` is 1995.\n- In this row, check if the `artist` is \"Robson & Jerome\".\n- If both conditions are met, verify that the `album` title matches \"Robson & Jerome\".\n\n**Step-by-step Verification:**\n\n1. **Find the Row for 1995**: Look through the data to find a row with `year` as 1995.\n2. **Check Artist Name**: In this row, confirm that the `artist` is \"Robson & Jerome\".\n3. **Verify Album Title**: Ensure the `album` column in this row matches \"Robson & Jerome\".\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- The row for 1995 has:\n  - `year`: 1995\n  - `artist`: Robson & Jerome\n  - `album`: Robson & Jerome\n\nThe album title \"Robson & Jerome\" indeed matches the artist name and the specified year.\n\nTherefore, based on this verification process:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the row with year 1995.
