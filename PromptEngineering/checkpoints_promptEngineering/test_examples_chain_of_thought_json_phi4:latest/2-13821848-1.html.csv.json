All entries start from round 1.\n\n4. **Checking Players from \"La Salle\":**\n   - There are two players listed as coming from \"la salle\":\n     - Albert Butts (round 5, pick 116)\n     - Ralph Lewis (round 6, pick 139)\n\n5. **Cross-Referencing Round and School:**\n   - Neither of the players from \"la salle\" was drafted in round 2.\n\n6. **Year Consideration:**\n   - The table does not provide any information about the year. However, based on historical context, the Boston Celtics did not draft players in 1985 as they were part of the NBA Draft during that time.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- There is no entry for a round 2 pick from \"la salle\" in the table.\n- The claim specifies a particular team (\"boston celtic\") and year (1985), neither of which are supported by the data provided.\n- Therefore, based on the absence of relevant data, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table does not contain any entry for round 2.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the boston celtic have a 2nd round draft pick in 1985\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table, we need to analyze the data provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim specifies two main points:\n   - A team named \"boston celtic\".\n   - A 2nd round draft pick in a specific year (1985).\n\n2. **Analyze the Table**:\n   - The table contains information about players selected in a draft, including their respective rounds and picks.\n   - The relevant columns for this analysis are \"round\" and \"player\", as they might give us insights into team selections.\n\n3. **Identify Relevant Rows**:\n   - We need to check if there is any row corresponding to the 2nd round (i.e., `round = 2`).\n   - If such a row exists, we will then verify whether it mentions \"boston celtic\" in relation to the player or team selection.\n\n4. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: Round is 1, not relevant.\n   - **Row 2**: Round is 3, not relevant.\n   - **Row 3**: Round is 4, not relevant.\n   - **Row 4**: Round is 5, not relevant.\n   - **Row 5**: Round is 6, not relevant.\n   - **Row 6**: Round is 7, not relevant.\n\n5. **Conclusion from the Table**:\n   - There are no entries for a 2nd round pick in the table.\n   - Without any data indicating a 2nd round selection or mentioning \"boston celtic\", we cannot confirm the claim based on this information alone.\n\n6. **Final Assessment**:\n   - Since there is no evidence of a 2nd round draft pick for any team, let alone the Boston Celtics, in the provided table, the claim must be considered FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table does not contain any data for a 2nd round draft pick. It lists selections from rounds 1 to 7, none of which are the 2nd round. Additionally, there is no mention of 'boston celtic' in any context within the table. Therefore, based on the provided data, the claim cannot be substantiated.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"Andrew Battle be draft 80 pick before Chris Remly,\" we must examine the provided table to find relevant information about both players, focusing on their respective draft picks.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Players:**\n   - The claim involves two players: Andrew Battle and Chris Remly.\n   \n2. **Locate Player Information in Table:**\n   - We need to find the rows corresponding to \"Andrew Battle\" and \"Chris Remly\" within the table.\n\n3. **Examine Details for Each Player:**\n\n   - **For Andrew Battle:**\n     - Row 2 of the data contains:\n       - Round: 3\n       - Pick: 70\n       - Player: Andre Battle (Note the discrepancy in first name \"Andrew\" vs. \"Andre\")\n       - Nationality: United States\n       - School/Club Team: Loyola (IL)\n\n   - **For Chris Remly:**\n     - Row 5 of the data contains:\n       - Round: 7\n       - Pick: 162\n       - Player: Chris Remly\n       - Nationality: United States\n       - School/Club Team: Rutgers\n\n4. **Analyze Draft Picks:**\n   - Andrew Battle (Andre Battle) is drafted at pick number 70.\n   - Chris Remly is drafted at pick number 162.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"Andrew Battle be draft 80 pick before Chris Remly.\"\n   - We observe:\n     - Andre Battle was indeed picked before Chris Remly (pick 70 vs. pick 162).\n     - However, the claim mentions a specific condition of being drafted as the \"80th\" pick.\n     - Andre Battle was not drafted at the 80th pick; he was drafted at the 70th pick.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Although Andrew Battle (Andre Battle) was drafted before Chris Remly, the specific condition regarding the 80th pick is not met.\n   - Therefore, the claim as stated is FALSE because it incorrectly specifies the draft position of Andre Battle.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- For Andrew Battle (Andre Battle):\n  - Row index: 1\n  - Column name: \"pick\"\n  - Value: 70\n\n- For Chris Remly:\n  - Row index: 4\n  - Column name: \"pick\"\n  - Value: 162\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim involves checking if Andrew Battle was drafted as the 80th pick before Chris Remly.
