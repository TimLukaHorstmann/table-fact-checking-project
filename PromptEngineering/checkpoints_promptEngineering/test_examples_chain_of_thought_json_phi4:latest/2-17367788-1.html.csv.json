    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, we will analyze the data provided in the table for the specific column \"points 1\". The claim states that all numbers in the \"points 1\" column should be between 25 and 71.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Column**: \n   - We need to focus on the \"points 1\" column as specified by the claim.\n   \n2. **Extract Values from the Column**:\n   - From the data provided, extract all values in the \"points 1\" column for each row.\n\n3. **List of Points Values**:\n   - Extracted points: \n     - Row 1: 71\n     - Row 2: 65\n     - Row 3: 62\n     - Row 4: 62\n     - Row 5: 59\n     - Row 6: 58\n     - Row 7: 57\n     - Row 8: 57\n     - Row 9: 55\n     - Row 10: 53\n     - Row 11: 44\n     - Row 12: 42\n     - Row 13: 40\n     - Row 14: 39\n     - Row 15: 39\n     - Row 16: 38\n     - Row 17: 37\n     - Row 18: 35\n     - Row 19: 34\n     - Row 20: 34\n     - Row 21: 33\n     - Row 22: 33\n     - Row 23: 32\n     - Row 24: 25\n\n4. **Check Each Value Against the Claim**:\n   - The claim specifies that all values should be between 25 and 71, inclusive.\n   - We need to verify if each value falls within this range.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - All extracted points (71, 65, 62, 62, 59, 58, 57, 57, 55, 53, 44, 42, 40, 39, 39, 38, 37, 35, 34, 34, 33, 33, 32, and 25) are indeed within the range of 25 to 71.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since every value in the \"points 1\" column satisfies the condition of being between 25 and 71, inclusive, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells are all the rows with their respective points from the \"points 1\" column as they were checked against the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the 'points 1' column, extracted values for each row, verified that each value is between 25 and 71 inclusive.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"there be no position when play be less than 46\" is true, we need to analyze the table data for each team\u2019s number of matches played.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that all positions have a team with at least 46 games played. We need to verify this by checking the \"played\" column in the dataset for each row.\n\n2. **Data Structure**: \n   - The table is structured as a list of lists (rows) where each inner list represents a team's statistics.\n   - Each row contains the following data: `position`, `team`, `played`, `drawn`, `lost`, `goals for`, `goals against`, `goal difference`, `points 1`.\n\n3. **Focus on the \"played\" Column**:\n   - The column corresponding to \"played\" is at index 2 in each row (third element).\n\n4. **Check Each Row**: \n   - For every team listed, verify if the number of games played (`played`) is 46.\n\n5. **Iterate Through Data**:\n   - Check the value at index 2 for all rows to confirm it's 46.\n\n### Verification:\n\n- **Row-by-row Analysis**:\n  - Row 0: `position` = 1, `played` = 46\n  - Row 1: `position` = 2, `played` = 46\n  - ...\n  - Continue this verification for all 24 rows.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: \n   - Each row in the dataset shows that the number of games played is exactly 46.\n   - Therefore, there are no positions with a team having played less than 46 games.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim is TRUE because every team has played exactly 46 matches.
