    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table data for matches played on 31 July 1965 and check if there is a match where:\n\n1. The home team score is \"11.15 (81)\".\n2. For that particular game, the away team score is \"8.12 (60)\".\n\nLet's go through the steps systematically:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Relevant Date:**\n   - All rows in the table are associated with the date \"31 July 1965\", so we consider all rows for further analysis.\n\n2. **Find Row with Home Team Score of \"11.15 (81)\":**\n   - We need to find a row where the \"home team score\" is exactly \"11.15 (81)\".\n   - Checking each row:\n     - Row 0: home team score is \"10.17 (77)\"\n     - Row 1: home team score is \"13.18 (96)\"\n     - **Row 2:** home team score is \"9.19 (73)\"\n     - Row 3: home team score is \"14.12 (96)\"\n     - **Row 4:** home team score is \"12.11 (83)\"\n     - **Row 5:** home team score is \"8.12 (60)\" [not the one we are looking for]\n\n   - We find that Row 4 has a home team score of \"12.11 (83)\", but this isn't what we're looking for.\n   - The only row with \"home team score\" as \"11.15 (81)\" is **Row 4**.\n\n3. **Check Away Team Score in That Row:**\n   - For Row 4:\n     - Home team: Melbourne\n     - Away team: Fitzroy\n     - Home team score: \"12.11 (83)\"\n     - **Away team score:** \"11.15 (81)\"\n\n4. **Compare the Away Team Score to Claimed Value:**\n   - The claim states that the away team score should be \"8.12 (60)\".\n   - In Row 4, the actual away team score is \"11.15 (81)\", not \"8.12 (60)\".\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is false because there is no match where the home team scored \"11.15 (81)\" and the away team scored \"8.12 (60)\" simultaneously. The only game with a home team score of \"11.15 (81)\" had an away team score of \"11.15 (81)\".\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim is false because Row 4, where the home team score is '11.15 (81)', has an away team score of '11.15 (81)' instead of '8.12 (60)'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\", \"value\": \"12.11 (83)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\", \"value\": \"11.15 (81)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
