This confirms the claim.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"driver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
