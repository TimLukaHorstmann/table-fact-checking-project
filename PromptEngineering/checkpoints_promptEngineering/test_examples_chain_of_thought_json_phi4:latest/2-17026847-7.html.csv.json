    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about average crowd attendance when the home team is Vida is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: First, locate all instances where \"vida\" appears as the home team from the table's data.\n\n2. **Extract Attendance Values**: For each instance where \"vida\" is the home team, extract the corresponding attendance value.\n\n3. **Calculate Average Attendance**: Compute the average of these extracted attendance values to verify if it equals 2709.\n\n4. **Compare and Conclude**: Compare the calculated average with the claimed value (2709) to determine whether the claim is true or false.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - We need to find rows where \"vida\" is listed as the home team.\n   - From the table data, we locate one such instance: \n     ```json\n     [\n       \"9 august 2008\",\n       \"vida\",\n       \"1:1\",\n       \"motagua\",\n       2709\n     ]\n     ```\n\n2. **Extract Attendance Values**:\n   - For the row where \"vida\" is the home team, the attendance value is 2709.\n\n3. **Calculate Average Attendance**:\n   - Since there is only one instance of Vida playing as the home team in this dataset, the average attendance is simply the attendance for that match.\n   - Therefore, the average attendance = 2709.\n\n4. **Compare and Conclude**:\n   - The calculated average attendance (2709) matches the claimed average attendance (2709).\n\nThus, based on the data provided, the claim \"on average, there be 2709 crowd attendance when the home team be vida\" is TRUE.\n\n### Final JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Identify rows where 'vida' is the home team.\\n2. Extract the attendance value for these instances.\\n3. Calculate the average of extracted attendance values.\\n4. Compare the calculated average with the claimed value (2709).\\nThe claim is TRUE as there's only one instance and its attendance matches the claimed average.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
