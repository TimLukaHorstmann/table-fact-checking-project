This means:\n   - Every ship listed should have a commissioning date in May 1935.\n   - The ship \"Fury\" can be an exception and may have a different commissioning month.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Data**: Identify the commissioning dates from the table data for each ship. We will focus on the \"commissioned\" column to verify the claim.\n\n3. **Check Each Ship**:\n   - For \"Fame\", check if it was commissioned in May 1935.\n   - Repeat this process for all other ships: Fearless, Firedrake, Foresight, Forester, Fortune, Foxhound, and Faulknor.\n   - Finally, check the commissioning date for \"Fury\" to see if it differs from May 1935.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - If all ships except \"Fury\" are commissioned in May 1935, then the claim is true.\n   - If any ship other than \"Fury\" does not meet this criterion, or if \"Fury\" was also commissioned in May 1935, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Analyze Each Row**:\n   - Fame: Commissioned on 26 April 1935 (not May).\n   - Fearless: Commissioned on 22 December 1934 (not May).\n   - Firedrake: Commissioned on 30 May 1935 (May).\n   - Foresight: Commissioned on 15 May 1935 (May).\n   - Forester: Commissioned on 29 March 1935 (not May).\n   - Fortune: Commissioned on 27 April 1935 (not May).\n   - Foxhound: Commissioned on 6 June 1935 (not May).\n   - Fury: Commissioned on 18 May 1935 (May).\n   - Faulknor: Commissioned on 24 May 1935 (May).\n\nFrom this analysis, we see that not all ships except \"Fury\" were commissioned in May 1935.
