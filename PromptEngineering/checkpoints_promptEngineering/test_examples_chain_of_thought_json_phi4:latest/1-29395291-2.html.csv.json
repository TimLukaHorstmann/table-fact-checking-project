    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Glo Mobile's subscriber count for 2006 being a maximum of 11000 is true or false, we need to follow these reasoning steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Provider**: The claim specifically mentions \"Glo Mobile\". We first locate this provider in the table.\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Data**: Once we find the row corresponding to \"Glo Mobile\", we will look at the column for \"subscribers (2006) (thousands)\" since it contains the subscriber numbers for 2006.\n\n3. **Check the Subscriber Count**: We need to verify if the number of subscribers in this column is indeed 11000 as stated in the claim.\n\n4. **Assess Maximum Condition**: The claim states that the maximum number of 2006 subscribers for Glo Mobile \"be\" 11000, implying it should be exactly 11000 and not exceed it.\n\n5. **Compare with Other Providers (Optional)**: While this step is not strictly necessary to validate the claim about a single provider, ensuring no other provider has more than 11000 in 2006 subscribers would reinforce that 11000 is indeed a significant number, but our focus remains on Glo Mobile.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Provider**: Locate \"Glo Mobile\" in the table:\n   - In the data array, find the row with [\"glo mobile\", \"nigeria\", 9000, 11000, 22.0].\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Data**: Check the \"subscribers (2006) (thousands)\" column for this row:\n   - The value is 11000.\n\n3. **Check the Subscriber Count**: Confirm that this matches the claim of being exactly 11000.\n\n4. **Assess Maximum Condition**: Since the subscriber count is exactly 11000, it satisfies the condition \"be\" 11000 (i.e., not exceeding it).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The data confirms that Glo Mobile had exactly 11000 subscribers in 2006, making the claim true.\n\nFinally, let's format our answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate 'Glo Mobile' in the table to find its subscriber count for 2006.

Glo Mobile had 11,000 subscribers in 2006.\n2. Glo Mobile experienced a subscriber growth of 52% from 2005 to 2006.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate the Relevant Data:**\n   - Find the row corresponding to \"glo mobile\" in the table.\n   - The relevant row is:\n     ```json\n     [\n       \"glo mobile\",\n       \"nigeria\",\n       9000,\n       11000,\n       22.0\n     ]\n     ```\n\n2. **Check Subscriber Numbers for 2006:**\n   - According to the table, in 2006, glo mobile had 11,000 subscribers.\n   - This matches part of the claim.\n\n3. **Verify Growth Percentage:**\n   - The growth percentage provided in the table for glo mobile is 22.0%.\n   - The claim states a growth of 52%, which does not match the data from the table.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - While the subscriber number (11,000) is correct, the growth percentage (52%) is incorrect according to the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the growth percentage stated in the claim does not match the actual growth percentage provided in the table data for glo mobile.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row corresponding to 'glo mobile' in the table.\",\n    \"Check the number of subscribers in 2006; it is 11,000 as per the claim.\",\n    \"Verify the growth percentage from 2005 to 2006; the table shows 22.0%, not 52% as claimed.\",\n    \"The subscriber count matches but the growth percentage does not match.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"subscribers (2006) (thousands)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"growth %\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
