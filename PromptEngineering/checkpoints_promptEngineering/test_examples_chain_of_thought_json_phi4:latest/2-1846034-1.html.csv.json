    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Great Britain (GBR) receiving 1 trophy which is bronze is TRUE or FALSE, let's examine the relevant data from the table:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - We need to find the row corresponding to \"Great Britain (gbr)\".\n   - In the provided table, Great Britain is listed at rank 7.\n\n2. **Check Gold, Silver, and Bronze Counts:**\n   - According to the data for row 6 (since rows are zero-indexed), Great Britain has:\n     - Gold medals: 0\n     - Silver medals: 0\n     - Bronze medals: 1\n\n3. **Calculate Total Trophies:**\n   - The total number of trophies is given as 1, which matches the sum of gold, silver, and bronze (0 + 0 + 1 = 1).\n\n4. **Verify Claim Details:**\n   - The claim states that Great Britain received \"1 trophy\" which is specifically a \"bronze\".\n   - Based on our analysis, Great Britain indeed has 1 bronze medal and no other medals.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since all parts of the claim match the data from the table, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant cells to verify this claim are those corresponding to the row for Great Britain (rank 7), specifically:\n  - Column \"bronze\" with value 1.\n  - Column \"total\" with value 1.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the row for Great Britain, check gold, silver, and bronze counts. Sum these to verify total trophies. Compare against claim: GBR has 0 gold, 0 silver, 1 bronze, totaling 1 trophy which matches the claim.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"bronze\", \"value\": 1},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\", \"value\": 1}\n  ]\n}\n```",
