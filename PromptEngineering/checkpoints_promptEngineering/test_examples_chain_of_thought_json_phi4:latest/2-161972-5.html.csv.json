    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true, we need to verify whether Richard Krajicek played against Michael Chang, Michael Stich, and Andre Agassi exactly two times each according to the table data.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Matches with Michael Chang**:\n   - Check each row for entries where \"opponent\" is \"michael chang\".\n   - Found matches on:\n     - 9 August 1993 (winner)\n     - 5 August 1996 (runner-up)\n\n2. **Count Matches with Michael Stich**:\n   - Check each row for entries where \"opponent\" is \"michael stich\".\n   - Found matches on:\n     - 22 February 1993 (runner-up)\n     - 27 February 1995 (winner)\n\n3. **Identify Matches with Andre Agassi**:\n   - Check each row for entries where \"opponent\" is \"andre agassi\".\n   - Found match on:\n     - 21 August 1995 (runner-up)\n\n4. **Verification of Match Counts**:\n   - Michael Chang: 2 matches\n   - Michael Stich: 2 matches\n   - Andre Agassi: 1 match\n\nThe claim states that Richard Krajicek played against each of these players exactly two times, but according to the data, he only played against Andre Agassi once. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- **Michael Chang**:\n  - Row index 16: \"opponent\" = \"michael chang\"\n  - Row index 34: \"opponent\" = \"michael chang\"\n\n- **Michael Stich**:\n  - Row index 8: \"opponent\" = \"michael stitch\"\n  - Row index 26: \"opponent\" = \"michael stitch\"\n\n- **Andre Agassi**:\n  - Row index 34: \"opponent\" = \"andre agassii\"\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We checked each row in the data for matches against Michael Chang, Michael Stich, and Andre Agassi. Krajicek played against Michael Chang twice, against Michael Stich twice, but only once against Andre Agassi. Thus, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
