    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Bob Gilder placed higher than John Daly\" is true or false, we need to examine their respective positions based on the data provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - Locate the row for Bob Gilder.\n     - In the table, Bob Gilder's score is listed as \"73 + 70 + 67 + 73 = 283\" with a total of \"-5 to par,\" and he shares a position label \"t5\".\n   - Locate the row for John Daly.\n     - John Daly's score is \"69 + 67 + 69 + 71 = 276\" with a total of \"-12 to par,\" and his position is labeled as \"1\".\n\n2. **Compare Positions:**\n   - Bob Gilder has a placement of \"t5\", indicating he tied for fifth place.\n   - John Daly has a placement of \"1\", which indicates he is in first place.\n\n3. **Determine the Claim Validity:**\n   - Since Bob Gilder's position (\"t5\") is lower than John Daly's position (\"1\"), it means that Bob Gilder did not place higher than John Daly.\n   - Therefore, the claim \"Bob Gilder placed higher than John Daly\" is false.\n\n4. **Identify Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - For Bob Gilder: Row index 4 (0-based) with column names \"place\", \"score\", and \"to par\".\n   - For John Daly: Row index 0 (0-based) with column names \"place\", \"score\", and \"to par\".\n\n### Final Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Locate Bob Gilder's row; he is at position t5.\",\n    \"Locate John Daly's row; he is at position 1.\",\n    \"Compare their positions: 1 is higher than t5.\",\n    \"Conclude that the claim 'Bob Gilder placed higher than John Daly' is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
