We are specifically interested in the \"res\" column to check for draw results.\n\n2. **Iterate Through Data**: Examine each row of the table's data to count how many times the result is a \"draw\".\n\n3. **Identify Draw Results**:\n   - Look at each entry under the \"res\" column.\n   - Count occurrences where the value is \"draw\".\n\n4. **Counting Draws**:\n   - Row 8: Result is \"draw\".\n   - No other rows have \"draw\" as their result.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: There is only one instance of a draw in the table, which matches the claim.\n\nNow, let's summarize this in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The 'res' column was checked for each row to identify any occurrences of 'draw'.

In mixed martial arts, common formats are minutes:seconds (e.g., 1:55) or just seconds if under a minute (e.g., 0:18).\n\n3. **Check Result for Shortest Duration**: Once we identify the match with the shortest time, verify whether it was recorded as a \"win\" against Borislav Jeliazkov.\n\n4. **Verify Match Details**:\n   - Look up the details of the match that lasted 0:18 to confirm its result and opponent.\n   - Confirm if this match is indeed the one with Borislav Jeliazkov (if necessary).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on our findings, we can conclude whether the claim is true or false.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:\n\n1. **Check Each Row's Time**:\n   - Row 0: \"1:55\" against Kimo Leopoldo.\n   - Row 1: \"1:34\" against Marcelo Tigre.\n   - Row 2: \"5:00\" against Osami Shibuya.\n   - Row 3: \"3:23\" against Kengo Watanabe.\n   - Row 4: \"5:00\" against Jeff Monson.\n   - Row 5: \"4:38\" against Gan McGee.\n   - **Row 6**: \"0:18\" against Joe Campanella (shortest duration).\n   - Row 7: \"2:23\" against Borislav Jeliazkov.\n   - Row 8: \"5:00\" against Ron Waterman.\n   - Row 9: \"5:00\" against Tsuyoshi Kohsaka.\n   - Row 10: \"6:58\" against Mark Tullius.\n   - Row 11: \"9:49\" against Eugene Jackson.\n   - Row 12: \"5:36\" against David Ross.\n   - Row 13: \"1:20\" against Paul Devich.\n\n2. **Identify Shortest Match**:\n   - The shortest match duration is in row 6, which lasted 0:18.\n\n3. **Verify Result and Opponent for Shortest Duration**:\n   - In row 6, the result is a \"win\" against Joe Campanella.\n   - This does not involve Borislav Jeliazkov.\n\n4. **Check Match Against Borislav Jeliazkov**:\n   - The match against Borislav Jeliazkov (row 7) lasted 2:23 and was a \"loss\".\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is false because the shortest match duration does not correspond to a win against Borislav Jeliazkov.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
