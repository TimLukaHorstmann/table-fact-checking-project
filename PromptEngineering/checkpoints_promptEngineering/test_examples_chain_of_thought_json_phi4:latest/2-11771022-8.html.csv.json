    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the Florida Panthers playing at home 9 times in March during the 2007-2008 season is true or false, we need to analyze the table data provided.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Home Games:**\n   - We need to identify the rows where \"florida\" is listed in the \"visitor\" column since these represent home games for Florida Panthers.\n   \n2. **Count Home Games in March:**\n   - Count how many such instances occur within the month of March.\n\n3. **Verify the Date Column:**\n   - Ensure that all identified home games fall under dates labeled as March (e.g., \"march 2\", \"march 4\", etc.).\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Row 1:** \n  - Visitor: \"florida\"\n  - Date: \"march 2\"  \n  - Home game for Florida.\n\n- **Row 2:** \n  - Visitor: \"florida\"\n  - Date: \"march 4\"  \n  - Home game for Florida.\n  \n- **Row 3:** \n  - Visitor: \"pittsburgh\" (not a home game)\n  \n- **Row 4:** \n  - Visitor: \"atlanta\" (not a home game)\n\n- **Row 5:** \n  - Visitor: \"ny islanders\"\n  - Date: \"march 12\"  \n  - Home game for Florida.\n\n- **Row 6:** \n  - Visitor: \"ny rangers\"\n  - Date: \"march 14\"  \n  - Home game for Florida.\n  \n- **Row 7:** \n  - Visitor: \"atlanta\"\n  - Date: \"march 16\"  \n  - Home game for Florida.\n\n- **Row 8:** \n  - Visitor: \"carolina\"\n  - Date: \"march 20\"  \n  - Home game for Florida.\n  \n- **Row 9:** \n  - Visitor: \"tampa bay\"\n  - Date: \"march 22\"  \n  - Home game for Florida.\n\n- **Row 10:** \n  - Visitor: \"florida\" (not a home game)\n  \n- **Row 11:** \n  - Visitor: \"atlanta\"\n  - Date: \"march 27\"  \n  - Home game for Florida.\n  \n- **Row 12:** \n  - Visitor: \"washington\"\n  - Date: \"march 29\"  \n  - Home game for Florida.\n\n### Count of Home Games in March:\n\nBy counting the relevant rows, we find that there are 9 instances where \"florida\" is listed as the visitor and the date falls within March.
