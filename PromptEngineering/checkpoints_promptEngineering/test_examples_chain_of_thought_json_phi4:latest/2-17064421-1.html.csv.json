    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to evaluate two parts:\n\n1. **Verify the round range**: The claim states that the rounds range from 2 to 10.\n2. **Check if each player comes from a different college**: The claim also suggests that there are players from 10 different colleges.\n\nLet's break down these tasks step by step using the table data provided in JSON format:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n#### Step 1: Verify Round Range\n- Examine the \"round\" column to see if it spans from 2 to 10.\n- The available rounds in the data are:\n  - Row 0: round 2\n  - Row 1: round 2\n  - Row 2: round 3\n  - Row 3: round 4\n  - Row 4: round 5\n  - Row 5: round 6\n  - Row 6: round 7\n  - Row 7: round 8\n  - Row 8: round 9\n  - Row 9: round 10\n\n- The minimum and maximum rounds are indeed 2 and 10, respectively. This part of the claim is TRUE.\n\n#### Step 2: Check for Unique Colleges\n- Examine the \"college\" column to see if each player comes from a different college.\n- List of colleges:\n  - Row 0: Duke\n  - Row 1: South Alabama\n  - Row 2: Eastern Kentucky\n  - Row 3: St. Bonaventure\n  - Row 4: Vanderbilt\n  - Row 5: Jackson State\n  - Row 6: Northern Michigan\n  - Row 7: San Diego\n  - Row 8: Hampton\n  - Row 9: Lamar\n\n- Each entry in the \"college\" column is unique, meaning there are no repeated colleges for different players. This part of the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth parts of the claim have been verified:\n1. The rounds range from 2 to 10.\n2. All players come from 10 different colleges.\n\nTherefore, the entire claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells are those corresponding to each player's \"round\" and \"college\":\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table data shows rounds ranging from 2 to 10 and unique colleges for each of the 10 players.
