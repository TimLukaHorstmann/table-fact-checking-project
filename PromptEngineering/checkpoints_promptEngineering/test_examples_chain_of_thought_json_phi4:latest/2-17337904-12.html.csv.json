    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"wu be the duke of both chen or lu\" is TRUE or FALSE, let's analyze the table step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Rows with \"wu\" as the Name\n\nFirst, we need to find any rows where the name column contains \"wu\".\n\n- **Row 0**: `wu` is listed under the name column for state `cai`.\n- **Row 9**: `wu` is listed under the name column for state `qi`.\n\n### Step 2: Check Titles and States\n\nNext, we need to check if \"wu\" holds the title of \"duke\" in either \"chen\" or \"lu\".\n\n- **State `chen`:**\n  - There is only one entry with state `chen`:\n    - Row 2: The name is `you`, not `wu`.\n  - No row has both the name `wu` and the state `chen`.\n\n- **State `lu`:**\n  - There is only one entry with state `lu`:\n    - Row 8: The name is `shen`, not `wu`. The title is \"duke\".\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Claim\n\nThe claim states that \"wu be the duke of both chen or lu\". For this to be true, there must be a row where:\n\n- The state is either `chen` or `lu`.\n- The name is `wu`.\n- The title is \"duke\".\n\nFrom our analysis:\n- There is no entry where `wu` is associated with the state `chen`.\n- There is an entry for `wu` in state `cai`, but the title is \"marquis\", not \"duke\".\n- In state `lu`, the name is `shen`, not `wu`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince there are no entries that satisfy all conditions of the claim, the statement is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify rows where 'wu' is listed as a name.
