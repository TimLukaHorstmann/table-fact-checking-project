The claim states that the lowest number of episodes in a single series is 11. Here's how we can verify it:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: \n   - The claim suggests that there are only 11 episodes in total across all series listed.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - Look at the \"no in series\" column to count the number of unique entries, which represents the total number of episodes.\n\n3. **Analyze the Data**:\n   - The data provided has episode numbers ranging from 11 to 23.\n   - These numbers indicate the sequential order of episodes within a single series.\n\n4. **Count the Total Episodes**:\n   - Count each entry in the \"no in series\" column: \n     - There are 13 entries (from 11 through 23).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The total number of episodes is 13, not 11 as claimed.\n   - Therefore, the claim that there are only 11 episodes in the series is incorrect.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists episode numbers from 11 to 23 under 'no in series'.
