    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"there be no game that be play on october 30 , 1977 that be list greater than week 7\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the given table data step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Week Number and Date:** \n   - We need to find the row in the table where the date matches \"October 30, 1977\". \n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Row:**\n   - Scanning through the data array under the \"date\" column, we identify that:\n     - The entry with \"october 30 , 1977\" corresponds to week number 7.\n\n3. **Check for Other Occurrences on October 30, 1977:**\n   - We need to check if there are any other entries in the data array with the date \"October 30, 1977\".\n\n4. **Verify Date Uniqueness:**\n   - By examining all rows in the table, we confirm that no other row has the date \"october 30 , 1977\" besides the one for week 7.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is only one game listed on October 30, 1977, and it corresponds to week 7, there are no games played on this date that are listed under a greater week number than 7.\n\nBased on these steps, we conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row with the date 'October 30, 1977'.\",\n    \"Find that it corresponds to week number 7.\",\n    \"Check for any other entries with the same date.\",\n    \"Confirm no additional games are listed on October 30, 1977.\",\n    \"Conclude there is no game on this date beyond week 7.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
