    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify each part of the statement: \n\n1. **Identify the player**: The claim mentions \"the fullback Ken Snelling\".\n2. **Check position**: We will look for a row where the player's name is \"Ken Snelling\" and his position is \"fullback\".\n3. **Verify pick number**: In that same row, we must ensure that the pick number is 58.\n4. **Confirm round**: Lastly, confirm that this occurs in round 7.\n\nLet's go through these steps using the table data:\n\n- We need to find a row where:\n  - The \"player\" column contains \"Ken Snelling\".\n  - The \"position\" column is \"fullback\".\n\nBy examining the table:\n\n1. Locate the row with player \"Ken Snelling\":\n   - Row at index 6: \n     - Player: \"Ken Snelling\"\n     - Position: \"fullback\"\n     - Pick: 58\n     - Round: 7\n\n2.
