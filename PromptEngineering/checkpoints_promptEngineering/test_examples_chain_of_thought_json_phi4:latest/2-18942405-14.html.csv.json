    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the Andrean school is true, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - The claim states that the \"andrean fighting '59ers have an enrollment of 587.\"\n   - Therefore, we need to find information about the school named \"andrean\" in the table and check its enrollment figure.\n\n2. **Locate the School Name:**\n   - In the JSON table under the column labeled \"school,\" look for the entry with the name \"andrean.\"\n\n3. **Extract Enrollment Data:**\n   - Once we identify the row where the school is named \"andrean,\" extract the value in the \"enrollment\" column to verify the enrollment figure.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - Compare the extracted enrollment number with the claim's stated enrollment of 587.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - If the extracted enrollment matches the claimed enrollment, then the claim is TRUE.\n   - If it does not match, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Row for Andrean School:**\n   - Look at the \"school\" column in the data:\n     - The entry \"andrean\" appears in the first row (index 0).\n\n2. **Check Enrollment Value:**\n   - In row 0, under the \"enrollment\" column, we find the value is 587.\n\n3. **Compare with Claimed Enrollment:**\n   - The claim states that enrollment is 587.\n   - The table shows an enrollment of 587 for the Andrean school.\n\n4. **Determine Truthfulness:**\n   - Since both values match, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row index 0, column \"school\": Value \"andrean\"\n- Row index 0, column \"enrollment\": Value 587\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the row with 'andrean' in the 'school' column.
