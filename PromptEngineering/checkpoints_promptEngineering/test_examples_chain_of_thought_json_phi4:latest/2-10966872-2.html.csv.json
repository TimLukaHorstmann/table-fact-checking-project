    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the information provided in the table and follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Oldest Winner:**\n   - From the data, \"oldest winner\" corresponds to Clint Eastwood, who was 74 years old in the year 2004.\n\n2. **List All Years in Order:**\n   - Extract all the years mentioned for each record set:\n     - John Ford: 1952\n     - William Wyler: 1965\n     - Clint Eastwood: 2004\n     - John Huston: 1985\n     - Norman Taurog: 1930 / 31 (consider it as 1931 for simplicity)\n     - John Singleton: 1991\n\n3. **Sort the Years in Ascending Order:**\n   - Sorted years: 1931, 1952, 1965, 1985, 1991, 2004.\n\n4. **Determine the Third Most Recent Year:**\n   - The third most recent year from the sorted list is 1991.\n\n5. **Compare the Oldest Winner's Year with the Third Most Recent Year:**\n   - Clint Eastwood won in 2004.\n   - The third most recent year is 1991.\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"the oldest winner set the age record in the third most recent year list.\"\n   - Since 2004 (the year Clint Eastwood set the record) is not the same as 1991 (the third most recent year), the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's format this reasoning into a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the oldest winner: Clint Eastwood in 2004.\",\n    \"List all years from the data: 1952, 1965, 2004, 1985, 1931, 1991.\",\n    \"Sort the years in ascending order: 1931, 1952, 1965, 1985, 1991, 2004.\",\n    \"Determine the third most recent year from the sorted list: 1991.\",\n    \"Compare Clint Eastwood's winning year (2004) with the third most recent year (1991).\",\n    \"Since 2004 is not equal to 1991, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
