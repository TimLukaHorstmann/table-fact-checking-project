    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"in the regular season, all players have scored less than 300 goals\" is true or false, we need to examine the data for each player's regular season goal tally.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - The column of interest is \"regular season,\" which contains the number of goals scored by each player during the regular seasons of their careers.\n\n2. **Examine Each Player's Regular Season Goals:**\n   - We will go through each row (representing a player) and check the value in the \"regular season\" column to see if it is less than 300.\n\n3. **Check Each Row:**\n   - **Row 1:** Bobby Hull scored 604 regular season goals.\n     - 604 is greater than 300, so this contradicts the claim.\n   - **Row 2:** Stan Mikita scored 541 regular season goals.\n     - 541 is greater than 300, another contradiction.\n   - **Row 3:** Steve Larmer scored 406 regular season goals.\n     - 406 is greater than 300, yet another contradiction.\n   - **Row 4:** Denis Savard scored 377 regular season goals.\n     - 377 is greater than 300, contradicting the claim.\n   - **Row 5:** Dennis Hull scored 298 regular season goals.\n     - 298 is less than 300, consistent with the claim.\n   - **Row 6:** Jeremy Roenick scored 267 regular season goals.\n     - 267 is less than 300, consistent with the claim.\n   - **Row 7:** Tony Amonte scored 268 regular season goals.\n     - 268 is less than 300, consistent with the claim.\n   - **Row 8:** Hubert Pit Martin scored 243 regular season goals.\n     - 243 is less than 300, consistent with the claim.\n   - **Row 9:** Bill Mosienko scored 258 regular season goals.\n     - 258 is less than 300, consistent with the claim.\n   - **Row 10:** Ken Wharram scored 252 regular season goals.\n     - 252 is less than 300, consistent with the claim.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that all players have scored less than 300 regular season goals.
