    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"guy r strong be the coach of the ohio valley conference in 1953\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data from the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Year and Conference:**\n   - We are looking at the year \"1953\".\n   - The conference mentioned is \"ohio valley\".\n\n2. **Locate the Data for 1953 in the Table:**\n   - In the data section, find the entry where the \"year\" column is \"1953\".\n   - This corresponds to the first row of the data:\n     ```json\n     [\n       \"1953\",\n       \"ohio valley\",\n       \"16 - 9\",\n       \"9 - 1\",\n       \"paul s mcbrayer\"\n     ]\n     ```\n\n3. **Check the Coach for 1953:**\n   - In this row, the \"coach\" column shows \"paul s mcbrayer\".\n\n4. **Determine if Guy R Strong Was the Coach in 1953:**\n   - The coach listed for 1953 is not \"guy r strong\"; it is \"paul s mcbrayer\".\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since \"guy r strong\" was not the coach in 1953, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The year '1953' corresponds to a row where the conference is 'ohio valley' and the coach listed is 'paul s mcbrayer', not 'guy r strong'.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"ed byhre be the coach of the last ohio valley conference record, after 1961\" is true or false, let's go through the steps systematically:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that Ed Byhre was the coach for the last Ohio Valley Conference record mentioned in the table, specifically after the year 1961.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - We need to look at the entries with years after 1961.\n   - Focus on the \"coach\" and \"conference record\" columns.\n\n3. **Extract Data for Years After 1961**:\n   - **1965**: Coach is James E. Baechtold, Conference Record: 13 - 1\n   - **1972**: Coach is Guy R. Strong, Conference Record: 9 - 5\n   - **1979**: Coach is Ed Byhre, Conference Record: 9 - 3\n\n4. **Determine the Last Entry**:\n   - The last entry in chronological order after 1961 is for the year 1979.\n\n5. **Check the Coach for the Last Entry**:\n   - For the year 1979, the coach listed is Ed Byhre.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since Ed Byhre is indeed the coach for the last Ohio Valley Conference record entry (1979) after 1961, the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n- The relevant cells from the table are:\n  - Row index 5: Year \"1979\", Coach \"ed byhre\"\n  - Row index 4: Year \"1965\", Coach \"james e baechtold\" (for context)\n  - Row index 3: Year \"1961\", Coach \"paul s mcbrayer\" (for context)\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Ed Byhre was the coach for the last Ohio Valley Conference record entry after 1961.
