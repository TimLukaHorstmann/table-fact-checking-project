This means \"tauro fc\" has won 8 games.\n\n3. **Locate Alianza FC's Wins:**\n   - Find the row corresponding to \"alianza fc\". According to the table, it is in the sixth row.\n   - In the sixth row, under the \"won (pg)\" column, the value is 7.

The higher the points, the better the ranking.\n   \n2. **Examine Points for Each Team:**\n   - \"Municipal Chorrillo\" is in row 4 with 27 points.\n   - \"Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense\" is in row 10 with 11 points.\n\n3. **Compare Points:**\n   - Municipal Chorrillo has 27 points.\n   - Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense has 11 points.\n   - Since 27 points (Municipal Chorrillo) is greater than 11 points (Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense), they do not tie in terms of ranking.\n\n4. **Determine Lowest Rank:**\n   - The team with the lowest rank based on this data would be Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense, as it has the fewest points.\n   - Municipal Chorrillo is ranked higher than Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense because it has more points.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - There is no tie for the lowest rank between Municipal Chorrillo and Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense.
