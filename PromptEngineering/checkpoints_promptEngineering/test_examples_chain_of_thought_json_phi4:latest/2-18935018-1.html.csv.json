    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about North Decatur and South Decatur having the exact same number of student enrollments is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data Points**: \n   - We are interested in the \"enrollment\" numbers for both North Decatur and South Decatur schools.\n   - According to the table schema, the \"enrollment\" column provides this information.\n\n2. **Locate North Decatur's Enrollment**:\n   - Find the row where the school is listed as \"north decatur\".\n   - From the data provided, North Decatur is in the 5th row (index 4).\n   - The enrollment for North Decatur is 397 students.\n\n3. **Locate South Decatur's Enrollment**:\n   - Find the row where the school is listed as \"south decatur\".\n   - From the data provided, South Decatur is in the 6th row (index 5).\n   - The enrollment for South Decatur is 316 students.\n\n4. **Compare Enrollments**:\n   - Compare the enrollment numbers: North Decatur has 397 students, and South Decatur has 316 students.\n   - Since 397 is not equal to 316, they do not have the same number of student enrollments.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that North Decatur and South Decatur have the exact same number of student enrollees is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- North Decatur Enrollment: \n  - Row Index: 4\n  - Column Name: \"enrollment\"\n  - Value: 397\n\n- South Decatur Enrollment:\n  - Row Index: 5\n  - Column Name: \"enrollment\"\n  - Value: 316\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the enrollment data for North Decatur and South Decatur in the table.
