    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to evaluate it against the data provided in the table. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information from the Claim:**\n   - The claim mentions \"2008\" as the year.\n   - It specifies \"boutsen energy racing\" as the team.\n   - It states that the team gained \"9 points\".\n   - It refers to a total of \"15 races\".\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Data in the Table:**\n   - We need to find entries for the year 2008 involving \"boutsen energy racing\".\n\n3. **Check Each Entry for 2008 with Boutsen Energy Racing:**\n   - The first entry under the year 2008 involves \"formula renault 2.0 west european cup\" and lists:\n     - Races: 15\n     - Points: 9\n     - Team: boutsen energy racing\n   - The second entry for 2008 involves \"eurocup formula renault 2.0\" with the same team, but it shows:\n     - Races: 14\n     - Points: 0\n\n4. **Aggregate Information Across Entries:**\n   - For the year 2008 and team \"boutsen energy racing\", we sum up the points from both relevant entries.\n   - Total races for boutsen energy racing in 2008 are the sum of races in both series:\n     - 15 (from the first entry) + 14 (from the second entry) = 29\n   - Total points gained by boutsen energy racing in 2008 is:\n     - 9 (from the first entry) + 0 (from the second entry) = 9\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"boutsen energy racing gain 9 point with 15 race\" in 2008.\n   - Based on our aggregation, while they did gain 9 points, this was over a total of 29 races, not 15.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is partially correct regarding the points but incorrect about the number of races.
