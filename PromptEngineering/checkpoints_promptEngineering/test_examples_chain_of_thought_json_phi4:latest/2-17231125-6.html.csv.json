Weibring.\n   - Both players are mentioned in the context of placing at a specific rank.\n\n2. **Locate Information for Larry Mize**:\n   - From the table, locate the entry where \"player\" is \"larry mize\".\n   - The row shows: \n     - Place: \"t5\"\n     - Player: \"larry mize\"\n     - Country: \"united states\"\n     - Score: \"69 + 67 + 72 = 208\"\n     - To par: \"- 5\"\n\n3. **Locate Information for D.A.
