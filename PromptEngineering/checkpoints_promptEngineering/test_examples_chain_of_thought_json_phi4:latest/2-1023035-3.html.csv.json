Here's a step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify Current Top Scorers**: Examine the \"goals\" column for each player to determine who currently holds the highest number of goals scored.\n   \n2. **Find Chris Wood\u2019s Current Goals**: Locate Chris Wood in the table and note his current goal tally.\n\n3. **Calculate Potential New Total for Chris Wood**: Add 5 (the additional goals mentioned in the claim) to Chris Wood's current goal total to determine what his new goal tally would be if he scored those extra goals.\n\n4. **Compare with Current Top Scorers**: Compare Chris Wood\u2019s potential new total against the highest current goal count from step 1.\n\n5. **Determine Validity of Claim**: If Chris Wood's new total surpasses the current top scorer, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Current Top Scorers**:\n   - Vaughan Coveny: 28 goals\n   - Shane Smeltz: 23 goals\n   - Steve Sumner: 22 goals\n   - Brian Turner: 21 goals\n\n2. **Chris Wood\u2019s Current Goals**: \n   - Chris Wood currently has 10 goals.\n\n3. **Calculate Potential New Total for Chris Wood**:\n   - If he scores 5 more goals, his total would be \\(10 + 5 = 15\\) goals.\n\n4. **Comparison with Current Top Scorers**:\n   - The current highest goal scorer is Vaughan Coveny with 28 goals.\n   - Chris Wood\u2019s potential new total of 15 goals does not surpass Vaughan Coveny's 28 goals.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since 15 is less than 28, even with the additional 5 goals, Chris Wood would not become the highest-scoring athlete for the team.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify Vaughan Coveny as the current top scorer with 28 goals.
