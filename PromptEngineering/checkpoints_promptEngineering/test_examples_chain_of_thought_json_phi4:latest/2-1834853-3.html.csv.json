    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Carsten Jancker scored 4 international goals in 2002\" is true or false, we need to analyze the provided table data for matches played in 2002 where Carsten Jancker could have scored.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Matches in 2002**:  \n   We first filter the data for matches that occurred in the year 2002.\n   \n   - **Row 7**: Date \"9 may 2002\", Competition \"friendly\", Score \"7 - 0\".\n   - **Row 8**: Date \"1 june 2002\", Competition \"2002 world cup\", Score \"4 - 0\".\n   - **Row 9**: Date \"21 august 2002\", Competition \"friendly\", Score \"2 - 2\".\n   - **Row 10**: Date \"11 october 2002\", Competition \"friendly\", Score \"1 - 1\".\n\n2. **Assess Goals Scored in Each Match**:\n   We need to determine if Carsten Jancker was involved in scoring goals in these matches.\n\n   - **Friendly on 9 May 2002 (Row 7)**: \n     - The score is \"7 - 0\". While the data does not specify individual scorers, this match presents an opportunity for multiple goals.\n   \n   - **World Cup on 1 June 2002 (Row 8)**:\n     - The score is \"4 - 0\" and the result is \"8 - 0\", indicating that additional goals were scored in extra time or after the initial period. Again, individual scorers are not specified.\n\n   - **Friendly on 21 August 2002 (Row 9)**:\n     - The score is \"2 - 2\". Carsten Jancker did not contribute to a goal here as his team did not win.\n   \n   - **Friendly on 11 October 2002 (Row 10)**:\n     - The score is \"1 - 1\". Similarly, no goals were scored by Carsten Jancker's team.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   To verify if Carsten Jancker scored 4 goals specifically, we need more detailed information about the individual goal scorers in these matches. The table does not provide such details beyond match scores and results.\n\nGiven this lack of specific information on whether Carsten Jancker was responsible for any goals in these matches, we cannot definitively confirm that he scored 4 international goals in 2002 based solely on the provided data.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, filter the matches played in 2002.

We will focus on rows where the competition column indicates either \"2002 world cup\" or \"2002 world cup qualifier\".\n\n2. **Check Rows for World Cup Qualifier**:\n   - On June 2, 2001: The match was a \"2002 world cup qualifier\", with scores listed as \"2 - 2\". This row is relevant to the claim.\n   - On September 1, 2001: Another \"2002 world cup qualifier\" game, where the score was \"1 - 5\". This row is also relevant.\n\n3. **Check Rows for World Cup**:\n   - On June 1, 2002: The competition listed is \"2002 world cup\", with scores \"4 - 0\".

This indicates no goals were scored by either team (or possibly by Jancker).\n   - For September 1, 2001: The result was \"1 - 5\", with a game score of \"1 - 0\". Again, no indication that Carsten Jancker specifically scored.\n   - For June 1, 2002: The result is \"8 - 0\" against the score \"4 - 0\".

The total goals scored at this venue by the home team are eight.\n   - Third Entry (Date: 9 May 2002):\n     - Venue: dreisamstadion, freiburg\n     - Score: 7 - 0\n     - Result: 7 - 0\n     - Seven goals were scored in this match for the team playing at home.\n\n4. **Summarize Goals Scored at Dreisamstadion:**\n   - From the data above, Carsten Jancker's team (assumed to be the one scoring) played three matches at dreisamstadion with cumulative goals of 8 + 7 = 15 goals scored by his team in these matches.\n\n5. **Determine Goals Scored Elsewhere:**\n   - Check other venues for any additional matches:\n     - Easycredit-Stadion, Nuremberg (3 June 2000): Team scored 1 goal.\n     - Helsinki Olympic Stadium, Helsinki (2 June 2001): Team scored 2 goals.\n     - Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s Stadium, Budapest (15 August 2001): Team scored 3 goals.\n     - Olympiastadion, Munich (1 September 2001): Team did not score any goal.\n     - Sapporo Dome, Sapporo (1 June 2002): Team scored 4 goals.\n     - Vasil Levski National Stadium, Sofia (21 August 2002): Team scored 2 goals.\n     - Asim Ferhatovi\u0107 Hase Stadium, Sarajevo (11 October 2002): Team scored 1 goal.\n\n6. **Calculate Total Goals Scored:**\n   - Sum of goals at all venues except Dreisamstadion:\n     - 1 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 13 goals\n\n7. **Compare Goals Scored at Dreisamstadion vs. Elsewhere:**\n   - Total goals scored by Carsten Jancker\u2019s team across all venues is 15 (Dreisamstadion) + 13 (Elsewhere) = 28.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since he did not score all his goals at Dreisamstadion, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells are those that show matches played at dreisamstadion and other venues where goals were scored:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify matches played by Carsten Jancker from the table.
