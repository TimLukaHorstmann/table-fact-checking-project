    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to examine the data for the candidate Mike Huckabee. The claim states that \"651300 be after debt when cash on hand be 603490.\" This suggests a comparison between the \"cash on hand\" value and the \"after debt\" value.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - We are given data for several candidates, but we need to focus specifically on Mike Huckabee's row.\n\n2. **Locate Cash on Hand:**\n   - Find the cell corresponding to \"cash on hand\" for Mike Huckabee.\n   - In the table, the cash on hand value is 651300.\n\n3. **Locate After Debt:**\n   - Find the cell corresponding to \"after debt\" for Mike Huckabee.\n   - The after debt value is 603490.\n\n4. **Compare Values:**\n   - Compare the values of \"cash on hand\" and \"after debt.\"\n   - Cash on Hand = 651300\n   - After Debt = 603490\n\n5. **Assess the Claim:**\n   - The claim suggests that \"651300 be after debt when cash on hand be 603490.\"\n   - However, from the data:\n     - Cash on Hand (651300) is not equal to After Debt (603490).\n     - Instead, Cash on Hand is greater than After Debt.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is incorrect because it incorrectly states that the cash on hand value is equivalent to the after debt value when they are different.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- \"cash on hand\" for Mike Huckabee: row index 5, column name \"cash on hand\", value 651300.\n- \"after debt\" for Mike Huckabee: row index 5, column name \"after debt\", value 603490.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Identify the data for Mike Huckabee. 2. Locate 'cash on hand' which is 651300 and 'after debt' which is 603490. 3. Compare these values: Cash on Hand (651300) is not equal to After Debt (603490). The claim incorrectly equates these two different amounts.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"cash on hand\", \"value\": 651300},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"after debt\", \"value\": 603490}\n  ]\n}\n```",
