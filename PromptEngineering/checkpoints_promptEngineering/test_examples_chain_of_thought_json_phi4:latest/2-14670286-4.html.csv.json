We need to look at all entries from these years in the dataset.\n\n2. **Extract Data for 2012**:\n   - Check each row for a \"date\" in the year 2012.\n   - Rows with dates in June 2012 are relevant, as they specify matches played on 3rd and 8th of June 2012.\n\n3. **Check Venue for 2012 Matches**:\n   - For the match on 3 June 2012: The venue is \"saitama stadium 2002, saitama\", with a score of \"1 - 0\" and result \"3 - 0\". This indicates that a game was played at Saitama Stadium in 2012.\n   - For the matches on 8 June 2012: The venue remains \"saitama stadium 2002, saitama\" for all listed scores (1-0, 2-0, 3-0, 5-0) with a result of \"6 - 0\". This confirms multiple games were played at the same venue on this date.\n\n4. **Extract Data for 2013**:\n   - Check each row for a \"date\" in the year 2013.\n   - Rows with dates in June, August, and September are relevant as they specify matches played on those months in 2013.\n\n5. **Check Venue for 2013 Matches**:\n   - For the match on 4 June 2013: The venue is \"saitama stadium 2002, saitama\", with a score of \"1 - 1\" and result \"1 - 1\". This indicates that a game was played at Saitama Stadium in 2013.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Games were indeed played at Saitama Stadium in both 2012 and 2013, specifically on the dates mentioned above.\n   - Therefore, the claim stating that \"none of the games in 2012 and 2013 be play at the venue saitama stadium\" is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For 3 June 2012: {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": [\"date\", \"venue\", \"score\", \"result\"]}\n- For 8 June 2012 (multiple entries): {\"row_index\": [10, 11, 12, 13], \"column_name\": [\"date\", \"venue\", \"score\", \"result\"]}\n- For 4 June 2013: {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": [\"date\", \"venue\", \"score\", \"result\"]}\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim is about whether any games were played at Saitama Stadium in the years 2012 and 2013.
