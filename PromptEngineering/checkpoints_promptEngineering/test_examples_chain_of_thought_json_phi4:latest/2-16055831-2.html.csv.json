    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the fighter have 5 win with the method knockout (strikes)\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table provided. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify Wins**: First, identify all rows in the data where the result is \"win\". This will help us focus only on successful outcomes.\n\n2. **Filter by Method**: From the identified wins, filter those where the method of victory is \"knockout (strikes)\".\n\n3. **Count the Wins**: Count the number of filtered results to see if there are exactly 5 wins with the specified method.\n\nLet's apply this process:\n\n- **Step 1: Identify Wins**\n  - Row 0: Result is \"win\"\n  - Row 1: Result is \"win\"\n  - Row 2: Result is \"win\"\n  - Row 3: Result is \"win\"\n  - Row 4: Result is \"win\"\n\n- **Step 2: Filter by Method \"knockout (strikes)\"**\n  - Row 0: Method is \"knockout (strikes)\"\n  - Row 1: Method is \"knockout (strikes)\"\n  - Row 2: Method is \"knockout (strikes)\"\n  - Row 3: Method is \"knockout (strikes)\"\n  - Row 4: Method is \"knockout (strikes)\"\n\n- **Step 3: Count the Wins**\n  - There are 5 wins where the method is \"knockout (strikes)\".\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is true.
