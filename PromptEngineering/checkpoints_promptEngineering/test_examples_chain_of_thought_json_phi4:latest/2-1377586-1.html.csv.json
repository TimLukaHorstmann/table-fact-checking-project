A nightwatchman is typically a lower-order batsman who comes in to bat higher up the order than usual, often during the end of the day's play or before an imminent declaration, to protect more skilled batsmen from playing under difficult conditions such as poor light or a deteriorating pitch.\n\nThe claim states that \"2 players in the nightwatchman (cricket) come from Australia.\" Let's analyze the data:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: We need to find instances where an Australian player scored, particularly looking for indications of being a nightwatchman.\n   \n2. **Check Each Entry**:\n   - Row 0: Nasim-ul-Ghani, Pakistan, 1962.

A nightwatchman is a lower-order batsman who comes in to bat higher up the order than usual, typically just before the last or second-last batsmen, especially when the team captain anticipates that batting conditions will deteriorate later on (e.g., during twilight or nighttime).

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"england play pakistan 2 time in the nightwatchman (cricket)\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the provided table for matches between England and Pakistan and check if any of these matches involved a player known as a nightwatchman scoring.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Matches Involving England vs. Pakistan:**\n   - We are looking for rows where \"versus\" is \"england\" or \"versus\" is \"pakistan\".\n\n2. **Check for Matches Between England and Pakistan:**\n   - Row 0: \n     - Player: nasim-ul-ghani\n     - Team: pakistan\n     - Score: 101\n     - Versus: england\n     - Year: 1962\n   - This row shows a match between Pakistan and England.\n\n3. **Count the Number of Matches Between England and Pakistan:**\n   - From the table, we have identified only one match (Row 0) where Pakistan played against England.\n\n4. **Check for Nightwatchman Involvement:**\n   - The claim specifically mentions \"nightwatchman,\" which refers to a lower-order batsman sent in to bat before the main tailenders.\n   - We need to verify if nasim-ul-ghani, who scored 101 in this match, was known as a nightwatchman. However, the table does not provide information about batting order or roles like \"nightwatchman.\"\n\n5. **Determine Validity of the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that England played Pakistan twice with a nightwatchman scoring.\n   - We only found one match between England and Pakistan in the table.\n   - There is no information provided about nasim-ul-ghani being a nightwatchman.\n\nBased on the analysis, the claim is FALSE because:\n- There is only one recorded match between England and Pakistan.\n- The role of nasim-ul-ghani as a nightwatchman is not indicated in the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified one match between England and Pakistan (Row 0).
