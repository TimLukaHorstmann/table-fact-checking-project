We will focus on entries from this year.\n\n2. **Locate Entries for 1989**:\n   - Check each row in the data to find those with the \"year\" column equal to 1989.\n   - From the table, there are two rows for the year 1989:\n     - Row index 8: [\"1989\", \"canon williams team\", \"williams fw12c\", \"renault v10\", 37]\n     - Row index 9: [\"1989\", \"canon williams team\", \"williams fw13\", \"renault v10\", 37]\n\n3. **Check Team Name**: The claim mentions the team \"ligier gitanes\". We need to verify if any entry for 1989 matches this team name.\n   - Neither of the rows for 1989 has \"ligier gitanes\" as the team; both have \"canon williams team\".\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since there are no entries for \"ligier gitanes\" in 1989, they could not have earned any points, let alone 37.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false because there are no records of \"ligier gitanes\" earning points in 1989.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim specifies that 'ligier gitanes' earned 37 points in 1989.
