The value here is \"crew stadium, columbus\".\n\n5. **Compare and Conclude**:\n   - Compare the extracted value with the location mentioned in the claim (\"crew stadium, columbus\").\n   - They match exactly.\n\n6. **Determine Truth Value**:\n   - Since the data from the table confirms that the 2011-2012 soccer state tournament was indeed held at \"crew stadium, columbus\", the claim is TRUE.\n\n7. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells are those in the row for soccer, specifically under the columns:\n     - \"sport\": Row index 2\n     - \"2011 - 2012 state tournament location\": Row index 2\n\nHere's the final output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the row corresponding to 'soccer' and checked the column for '2011 - 2012 state tournament location'.
