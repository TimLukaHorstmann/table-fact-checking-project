    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the settlement of lok have a population of 1114\" is true or false, we will analyze the table data step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Settlement**: We need to locate the row corresponding to the settlement named \"lok\".\n\n2. **Locate the Population Data**: Once the correct row for \"lok\" is identified, we will look at the \"population (2011)\" column in that row.\n\n3. **Compare with Claimed Value**: Compare the population value from the table with the claimed value of 1114.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Find the Row for \"lok\"**:\n   - The settlement name is listed under the first column titled \"settlement\".\n   - We scan through the rows to find one where the \"settlement\" entry matches \"lok\".\n\n2. **Identify the Population in That Row**:\n   - After identifying the row for \"lok\", we look at the fourth column, which is labeled \"population (2011)\".\n\n3. **Compare Values**:\n   - In the identified row for \"lok\", the population value is 1114.\n   - The claim states that \"the settlement of lok have a population of 1114\".\n   - Since both values match, the claim is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is verified as true based on the data provided in the table.
