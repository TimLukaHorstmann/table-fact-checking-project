    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Kansas City have no post-season record in 2013\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the provided table data step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Year of Interest:**\n   - The claim refers to the year 2013. We need to locate this specific season in the table.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Row:**\n   - In the \"data\" section, each sublist represents a row corresponding to a particular season.\n   - Look for the row where the \"season\" column has the value \"2013\".\n\n3. **Check the MLB Affiliate:**\n   - The claim specifically mentions Kansas City, so we need to verify that the \"MLB affiliate\" for this year is indeed \"Kansas City\".\n   - In the 13th row (index 12), the season is \"2013\" and the MLB affiliate is \"kansas city\".\n\n4. **Examine Post-Season Record:**\n   - Once we have confirmed the correct row, check the \"post-season record\" column to see if there is any post-season performance recorded.\n   - In the same row (13th), the \"post-season record\" and \"post-season win %\" columns both contain \"-\".\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the \"post-season record\" for Kansas City in 2013 is \"-\", it indicates that there was no post-season record.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis, the claim \"Kansas City have no post-season record in 2013\" is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the year of interest (2013) in the table.\",\n    \"Locate the row where 'season' is '2013'.\",\n    \"Verify that the MLB affiliate for this row is 'Kansas City'.\",\n    \"Check the 'post-season record' column to see if it contains any data.\",\n    \"Since the 'post-season record' is '-', Kansas City had no post-season record in 2013.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"MLB affiliate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"post-season record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
