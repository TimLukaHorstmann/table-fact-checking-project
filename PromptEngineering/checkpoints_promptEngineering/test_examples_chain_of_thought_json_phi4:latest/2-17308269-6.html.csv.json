    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Ann Strother is true or false, we need to verify two parts of the statement:\n\n1. **Check if Ann Strother is from Connecticut:**\n   - Locate Ann Strother's entry in the table.\n   - Check the \"college / country / team\" column for her row to see if it lists \"Connecticut.\"\n\n2. **Verify that Ann Strother never played for Indiana Fever:**\n   - Look at the \"former wnba team\" column for her row to confirm whether it states \"Indiana Fever.\"\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Locate Ann Strother in the Table:**\n   - Ann Strother is listed as player 5 in the table.\n\n2. **Check Ann Strother's College/Country/Team:**\n   - For row index 4 (Ann Strother), the \"college / country / team\" column lists \"Connecticut.\"\n   - This confirms that she is from Connecticut, fulfilling the first part of the claim.\n\n3. **Verify Ann Strother's Former WNBA Team:**\n   - In the same row (index 4), the \"former wnba team\" column states \"Indiana Fever.\"\n   - This contradicts the second part of the claim, which asserts she never played for Indiana Fever.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe first part of the claim is true (Ann Strother is from Connecticut).
