This can be determined by counting the rows under \"data\".\n\n2. **Count Wins and Losses:**\n   - For each game, check the \"result\" column to determine if it is a win (\"w\") or a loss (\"l\").\n   - Keep track of the total number of wins and losses.\n\n3. **Calculate Difference Between Losses and Wins:**\n   - Subtract the total number of wins from the total number of losses.\n   - Check if this difference equals 3, as per the claim.\n\n4. **Verify Claim:**\n   - If the difference is exactly 3, then the claim is true. Otherwise, it is false.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Total Games Played:** There are 14 games listed in the table (from row indices 0 to 13).\n\n- **Wins and Losses:**\n  - Wins:\n    - Row 2 (Week 3): \"w 14 - 9\" against Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n    - Row 3 (Week 4): \"w 50 - 17\" against Kansas City Chiefs\n  - Losses:\n    - Row 0 (Week 1): \"l 30 - 21\" against Miami Dolphins\n    - Row 1 (Week 2): \"l 13 - 3\" against Houston Oilers\n    - Row 4 (Week 5): \"l 17 - 14\" against New York Jets\n    - Row 5 (Week 6): \"l 31 - 13\" against Baltimore Colts\n    - Row 6 (Week 7): \"l 26 - 22\" against New England Patriots\n    - Row 7 (Week 8): \"l 19 - 14\" against New York Jets\n    - Row 8 (Week 9): \"l 20 - 10\" against New England Patriots\n    - Row 9 (Week 10): \"l 17 - 10\" against Dallas Cowboys\n    - Row 10 (Week 11): \"l 34 - 13\" against San Diego Chargers\n    - Row 11 (Week 12): \"l 27 - 14\" against Detroit Lions\n    - Row 12 (Week 13): \"l 45 - 27\" against Miami Dolphins\n    - Row 13 (Week 14): \"l 58 - 20\" against Baltimore Colts\n\n- **Total Wins:** 2\n- **Total Losses:** 12\n\n- **Difference Between Losses and Wins:**\n  - \\( \\text{Losses} - \\text{Wins} = 12 - 2 = 10 \\)\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe difference between the number of losses and wins is 10, not 3.
