    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to examine the prize funds for all tournaments listed in the table and identify which ones are denominated in Korean Won (KRW) and which one, if any, is in US dollars.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Prize Fund Denominations:**\n   - The table provides the prize fund for each tournament under the column \"prize fund (krw)\". We need to check if this value uses KRW or another currency.\n   \n2. **Examine Each Tournament:**\n   - For each row in the data, we will look at the \"prize fund (krw)\" value and note its denomination:\n     - Row 1: 2,205,000 KRW\n     - Row 2: 1,000,000,000 KRW\n     - Row 3: 900,000,000 KRW\n     - Row 4: 500,000,000 KRW\n     - Row 5: 300,000,000 KRW\n     - Row 6: 300,000,000 KRW\n     - Row 7: 300,000,000 KRW\n     - Row 8: 500,000,000 KRW\n     - Row 9: 400,000,000 KRW\n     - Row 10: 1,000,000,000 KRW\n     - Row 11: 600,000,000 KRW\n     - Row 12: US 750,000 (This is in USD)\n     - Row 13: 1,000,000,000 KRW\n     - Row 14: 300,000,000 KRW\n\n3. **Identify the Tournament with USD Prize Fund:**\n   - The CJ Invitational (Row 12) has a prize fund of US 750,000, which is in US dollars.\n\n4. **Verify the KyJ Tour Championship's Denomination:**\n   - The Herald KyJ Tour Championship (Row 14) has a prize fund listed as 300,000,000 KRW, which is in Korean Won, not USD.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the CJ Invitational is the only tournament with a prize fund in US dollars, and the KyJ Tour Championship's prize fund is in Korean Won, the claim that \"the KyJ tour championship be the only competition on the Korean tour where the prize money be offer in American dollar\" is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists prize funds for each tournament. Most are denominated in KRW. The CJ Invitational has a prize fund in USD, while the KyJ Tour Championship's prize fund is in KRW. Therefore, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"prize fund (krw)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"prize fund (krw)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the tournaments held in September and December is true, let's break down the analysis step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Tournaments by Month\n\n- **September**:\n  - \"dongbu promi open\" from Sep 12 - 15\n  - \"shinhan donghae open\" from Sep 26 - 29\n\n- **December**: \n  - There are no tournaments listed in December.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Average OWGR Points for September Tournaments\n\nFrom the table, we identify the OWGR points for each tournament in September:\n\n1. \"dongbu promi open\":\n   - Row index: 9\n   - OWGR points: 6\n\n2. \"shinhan donghae open\":\n   - Row index: 10\n   - OWGR points: 6\n\n- Total number of tournaments in September = 2\n- Sum of OWGR points for these tournaments = 6 + 6 = 12\n- Average OWGR points for September = Total OWGR points / Number of tournaments = 12 / 2 = 6\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Claim\n\nThe claim states that \"September and December be the most popular month to host golf tournament in Korea,\" but since there are no tournaments listed in December, we can only evaluate this for September.\n\n- **Popularity**: \n  - September has two tournaments.\n  - No tournaments are held in December according to the table.\n\n- **Average OWGR Points**:\n  - The average OWGR points for September tournaments is indeed 6.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim that \"September and December be the most popular month to host golf tournament in Korea\" is partially incorrect because there are no tournaments listed for December. However, the part of the claim regarding the average OWGR points being 6 for September tournaments is correct.\n\nTherefore, the overall claim is FALSE due to the incorrect assertion about December.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identified the tournaments held in September and checked that there are no tournaments in December.
