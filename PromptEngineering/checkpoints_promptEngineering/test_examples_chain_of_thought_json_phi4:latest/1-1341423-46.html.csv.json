    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"in 1982, Norman Sisisky be re-elected\" is true or false, we need to follow a logical reasoning process by examining relevant parts of the provided table.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row**: \n   - The claim specifically mentions \"Norman Sisisky,\" so we should locate the row in the data that corresponds to him.\n   - In the JSON data, we find Norman Sisisky listed under the \"district\" column as \"Virginia 4.\"\n\n2. **Check Election Year**:\n   - The claim specifies the year 1982. We need to verify if Norman Sisisky was first elected in or before this year.\n   - According to the table, Norman Sisisky's \"first elected\" year is 1982.\n\n3. **Verify Re-election Status**:\n   - The claim states that he was re-elected. Therefore, we should check the \"results\" column for his district to confirm if he was indeed re-elected.\n   - For \"Virginia 4,\" the \"results\" column indicates \"re-elected.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since Norman Sisisky was first elected in 1982 and the results show that he was re-elected, the claim is consistent with the information provided.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The row corresponding to Norman Sisisky (row index 3) has relevant information:\n  - \"district\": \"virginia 4\"\n  - \"first elected\": 1982\n  - \"results\": \"re - elected\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim mentions Norman Sisisky and the year 1982.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"norman sisisky be re-elected after 1982\" is true or false, we will analyze the relevant parts of the table step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Norman Sisisky's Entry:**\n   - Locate the entry in the data array where the incumbent is \"norman sisisky\".\n   - This corresponds to the third row in the data section:\n     ```json\n     [\n       \"virginia 4\",\n       \"norman sisisky\",\n       \"democratic\",\n       1982,\n       \"re-elected\",\n       \"norman sisisky (d) unopposed\"\n     ]\n     ```\n\n2. **Verify Election Status:**\n   - Check the \"results\" column for this row to confirm if Norman Sisisky was re-elected.\n   - The value in this column is \"re-elected\", which indicates that he won his election after 1982.\n\n3. **Confirm Year of First Election:**\n   - Verify the \"first elected\" year to ensure it aligns with the claim's context.\n   - The \"first elected\" year for Norman Sisisky is 1982, confirming that he was first elected in that year and subsequently re-elected after this initial election.\n\n4. **Conclusion Based on Data:**\n   - Since the data shows that Norman Sisisky was indeed re-elected (and was first elected in 1982), the claim \"norman sisisky be re-elected after 1982\" is supported by the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are from row index 3 with columns \"incumbent\", \"first elected\", and \"results\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Locate the entry for Norman Sisisky in the data array.\",\n    \"Identify that the 'results' column indicates he was re-elected.\",\n    \"Confirm his 'first elected' year is 1982, which supports the context of being re-elected after this year.\",\n    \"Conclude that the claim is true based on the evidence from the table.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"incumbent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"first elected\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
