We look for entries in the data that have \"itunes\" mentioned in the \"country\" column.\n\n2. **Locate iTunes Entry**:\n   - There is one entry where \"country\" is listed as \"global (itunes)\".\n   - This entry has the following details:\n     - Date: 19 November 2012\n     - Label: Columbia\n     - Format: Digital download\n     - Catalogue no: 88697338292\n\n3. **Check for Earlier iTunes Releases**:\n   - The table lists all available data entries. We need to check if there is any other entry with \"itunes\" in the \"country\" column before this date (19 November 2012).\n   - There are no other entries with \"itunes\" in the \"country\" column.\n\n4. **Verify Date**:\n   - Since there are no earlier iTunes releases listed, the entry on 19 November 2012 is indeed the first one associated with iTunes according to the table data.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the information available in the table, the claim that this was the first release on iTunes internationally is true because it is the only iTunes-related entry and no earlier iTunes entries exist in the dataset.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table contains one entry with 'global (itunes)' as the country, dated 19 November 2012.
