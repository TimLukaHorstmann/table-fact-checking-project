    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Ryan Hunter-Reay and Jimmy Vasser is true or false, we need to verify each part of the statement for both drivers:\n\n1. **Check Team**: Both should be on \"american spirit team johansson\".\n2. **Points Check**: Each driver should have fewer than 2 points.\n3. **Grid Position Check**: Each driver's grid position should be larger than 4.\n\nLet's analyze each driver based on these criteria using the provided table data:\n\n### Ryan Hunter-Reay\n\n- **Team Verification**:\n  - The team for Ryan Hunter-Reay is \"american spirit team johansson\" (Row Index: 12, Column Name: `team`).\n\n- **Points Check**:\n  - Points for Ryan Hunter-Reay are 1 (Row Index: 12, Column Name: `points`).\n  - 1 is indeed fewer than 2.\n\n- **Grid Position Check**:\n  - Grid position for Ryan Hunter-Reay is 9 (Row Index: 12, Column Name: `grid`).\n  - 9 is larger than 4.\n\n### Jimmy Vasser\n\n- **Team Verification**:\n  - The team for Jimmy Vasser is \"american spirit team johansson\" (Row Index: 14, Column Name: `team`).\n\n- **Points Check**:\n  - Points for Jimmy Vasser are 0 (Row Index: 14, Column Name: `points`).\n  - 0 is fewer than 2.\n\n- **Grid Position Check**:\n  - Grid position for Jimmy Vasser is 16 (Row Index: 14, Column Name: `grid`).\n  - 16 is larger than 4.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll conditions in the claim are satisfied for both Ryan Hunter-Reay and Jimmy Vasser.
