    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"November 6, 1980 be the only record of a tied game that year\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table, we need to follow these reasoning steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim:** The claim suggests that there was a tied game on November 6, 1980. However, the claim seems misdated because the table data is from the year 1960, not 1980.\n\n2. **Inspecting the Table Data:**\n   - Look for any games with a result indicating a tie (usually marked as \"t\" for tied).\n   - Identify if there are multiple entries with such results and their respective dates.\n   \n3. **Checking Each Entry:**\n   - Review each entry in the data to find those with results starting with 't' which indicate a tied game:\n     - Week 12: Date is November 27, 1960; Result is \"t 38-38\"; The record becomes \"4 - 6 - 1\", indicating a tie.\n\n4. **Conclusion on Claim Validity:**\n   - There is only one recorded tied game in the data from the year 1960.\n   - The claim incorrectly references the year as 1980 instead of 1960 and also suggests it was on November 6, which is incorrect based on our inspection (the tie occurred on November 27, 1960).\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The claim is FALSE because there was a tied game on November 27, 1960, not November 6, 1980.\n\nRelevant cells:\n- Row with Week 12 contains the relevant information about the tie.\n\nHere's the JSON formatted response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim references an incorrect year (1980 instead of 1960) and date for a tied game.\",\n    \"Examine each entry in the table to identify games with a 't' result indicating a tie.\",\n    \"Identify only one instance of a tied game on November 27, 1960.\",\n    \"The claim's reference to November 6, 1980 is incorrect as per the data.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

We need to find this specific date within the data.\n\n2. **Check for Date Match**: Review each row's \"date\" column value until we find a match with \"November 13, 1960\".\n\n3. **Verify Game Site**: Once the correct row is found, check the \"game site\" column to see if it matches \"Cotton Bowl\".\n\n4. **Confirm Record Consistency**: Cross-verify the record in that row with the overall progression of records to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n5. **Draw Conclusion**: Based on the comparison between the claim and the data from the table, determine whether the statement is true or false.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.
