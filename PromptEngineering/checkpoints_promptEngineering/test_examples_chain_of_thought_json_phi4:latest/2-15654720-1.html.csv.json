    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"6 cash have earnings of 39380\" is true or false, we need to analyze the data provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Data**:\n   - We are looking for a row where the number of \"cashes\" is 6 and the corresponding \"earnings\" is 39380.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - For each season, check the value in the \"cashes\" column and see if it equals 6.\n   - If a row has \"cashes\" equal to 6, then verify if the \"earnings\" for that same row is 39380.\n\n3. **Review the Data**:\n\n   - **2002 - 03**: Cashes = 6, Earnings = 9500\n   - **2003 - 04**: Cashes = 15, Earnings = 45850\n   - **2004 - 05**: Cashes = 19, Earnings = 56675\n   - **2005 - 06**: Cashes = 22, Earnings = 130270\n   - **2006 - 07**: Cashes = 20, Earnings = 148425\n   - **2007 - 08**: Cashes = 18, Earnings = 108900\n   - **2008 - 09**: Cashes = 18, Earnings = 174680\n   - **2009 - 10**: Cashes = 16, Earnings = 85570\n   - **2010 - 11**: Cashes = 9, Earnings = 33690\n   - **2011 - 12**: Cashes = 10, Earnings = 39380\n   - **2012 - 13**: Cashes = 10, Earnings = 113259\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - None of the rows have \"cashes\" equal to 6.\n   - The row with earnings of 39380 has \"cashes\" equal to 10 (season 2011-12).\n\nSince there is no row where \"cashes\" equals 6 and \"earnings\" equals 39380, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Checked each season for 'cashes' = 6.
