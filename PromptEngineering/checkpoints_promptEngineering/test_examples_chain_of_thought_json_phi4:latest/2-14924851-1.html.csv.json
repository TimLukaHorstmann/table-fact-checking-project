    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the Flamengo team having the greatest number of points among teams with a negative goal differential is true, we must follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Teams with Negative Goal Differential**: \n   - We need to extract all teams that have a negative value in the \"difference\" column.\n\n2. **List and Compare Points**:\n   - For each team identified in step 1, note their points from the \"points\" column.\n   - Determine which team has the highest number of points among those with a negative goal differential.\n\n3. **Verify Flamengo's Position**:\n   - Check if Flamengo is among these teams and whether it indeed has the greatest number of points compared to others with a negative goal differential.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Teams with Negative Goal Differential\n- The column \"difference\" contains goal differentials for all teams.

Whether Fortaleza earned the fewest points.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n#### 1.
