    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the first place tie is true, we need to carefully analyze the data provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Players with First Place (t1):**\n   - The column \"place\" indicates positions. A value of \"t1\" signifies a tie for first place.\n   - Extract the rows where \"place\" is \"t1\":\n     - Row 0: ernie els, South Africa, score: 279, to par: -5\n     - Row 1: colin montgomerie, Scotland, score: 279, to par: -5\n     - Row 2: loren roberts, United States, score: 279, to par: -5\n\n2. **Identify the Players Claimed in the Statement for First Place (t1):**\n   - The claim states that Duffy Waldorf, Jeff Sluman, and Frank Nobilo are tied for first place.\n\n3. **Check if These Players Are Listed Under t1:**\n   - We need to verify if Duffy Waldorf, Jeff Sluman, and Frank Nobilo have \"place\" as \"t1\".\n   - Check the rows for these players:\n     - Row 11 (Duffy Waldorf): place is \"t9\", score is 284\n     - Row 10 (Jeff Sluman): place is \"t9\", score is 284\n     - Row 9 (Frank Nobilo): place is \"t9\", score is 284\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - None of Duffy Waldorf, Jeff Sluman, and Frank Nobilo are listed with a \"place\" value of \"t1\".\n   - Therefore, they are not tied for first place according to the table data.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Duffy Waldorf, Jeff Sluman, and Frank Nobilo are tied for first place. By examining the 'place' column in the table, it is clear that these players have a 't9' ranking, not 't1'. The actual first-place tie involves Ernie Els, Colin Montgomerie, and Loren Roberts.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
