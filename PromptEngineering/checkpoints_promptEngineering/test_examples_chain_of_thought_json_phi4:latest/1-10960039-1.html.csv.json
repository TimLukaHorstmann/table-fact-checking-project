    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"alexis bwenge be pick 8th, for the bc lion\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify two aspects from the given table: \n\n1. Whether Alexis Bwenge is indeed associated with the BC Lions.\n2. Whether his draft position is 8th.\n\nLet's examine the data step-by-step:\n\n- The table contains a column labeled \"pick,\" which indicates the draft order or selection number of players by their teams.\n  \n- We look for an entry where the \"cfl team\" is \"bc lions.\"\n  \n- Upon locating such an entry, we check the corresponding row to see if Alexis Bwenge is listed as the player in that row and whether his draft position (\"pick\") is 8.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate Entry for BC Lions:**\n   - Scan through the data rows under the \"cfl team\" column to find an entry where the value matches \"bc lions.\"\n\n2. **Verify Player Name:**\n   - In the located row for the BC Lions, check if the player's name is \"alexis bwenge.\"\n\n3. **Check Draft Position:**\n   - Ensure that in this same row, the draft position (\"pick\") is 8.\n\n### Examination of Data:\n\n- Row with `cfl team` as \"bc lions\":\n  - `pick`: 8\n  - `player`: alexis bwenge\n  - `position`: rb\n  - `college`: kentucky\n\nThe entry for the BC Lions confirms that Alexis Bwenge is indeed the player selected at pick number 8.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim \"alexis bwenge be pick 8th, for the bc lion\" matches the information in the table. Therefore, it is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells are those which contain the details of Alexis Bwenge's draft information by the BC Lions:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the entry where 'cfl team' is 'bc lions'.
