    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the game on March 20 between the Blues and the Penguins, where the score was stated to be 2 - 4, is true or false, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - We need to locate the row in the table that corresponds to a game involving both the \"Blues\" and the \"Penguins\" on March 20.\n\n2. **Examine the Date Column:**\n   - Check each entry's date column to find an entry with the date \"march 6\", \"march 7\", etc., up to \"march 31\".\n   - Locate the row where the date is \"march 20\".\n\n3. **Check Visitor and Home Columns:**\n   - For the identified date (\"march 20\"), check who the visitor was and who played at home.\n   - The claim specifies that this game involves the Blues as a visitor to the Penguins, so we expect the row to have \"blues\" in the visitor column and \"penguins\" in the home column.\n\n4. **Verify the Score Column:**\n   - Check the score recorded for the identified date and matchup.\n   - The claim states that the score was \"2 - 4\". This should match what is listed under the score column for this row.\n\n5. **Determine the Veracity of the Claim:**\n   - If all conditions are met (correct date, correct teams in visitor/home columns, and matching score), then the claim is true.\n   - Otherwise, if any condition fails, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the provided table:\n\n1. **Locate the row for \"march 20\":**\n   - The relevant data entry is: `[\"march 20\", \"blues\", \"2 - 4\", \"penguins\", 6126, \"23 - 33 - 12\", 58]`.\n\n2. **Verify Teams:**\n   - Visitor: \"blues\"\n   - Home: \"penguins\"\n\n3. **Check the Score:**\n   - Recorded score is \"2 - 4\" which matches the claim.\n\nSince all conditions specified in the claim are met, we can conclude that the statement is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, find the row with date 'march 20'.
