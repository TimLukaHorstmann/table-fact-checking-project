    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Rik de Voest be Alex Bogdanovic's opponent on April 4, 2011\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Date and Tournament:**\n   - The claim specifies the date as \"April 4, 2011\". We need to find this specific entry in the data.\n   \n2. **Locate Data for April 4, 2011:**\n   - Search through the table's data entries under the \"date\" column for \"4 april 2011\".\n   - The relevant row is:\n     ```json\n     [\n       \"4 april 2011\",\n       \"little rock , ar , usa f9\",\n       \"hard\",\n       \"arnau brugu\\u00e9s - davi\",\n       \"3 - 6 , 1 - 6\"\n     ]\n     ```\n   - In this row, the opponent in the final is listed as \"arnau brugu\u00e9s - davi\".\n\n3. **Compare with Claimed Opponent:**\n   - The claim states that Rik de Voest was Alex Bogdanovic's opponent on April 4, 2011.\n   - According to the table, the actual opponent was Arnau Brugu\u00e9s-Davi.\n\n4. **Check for Rik de Voest in Table:**\n   - Verify if there is any entry involving Rik de Voest as an opponent.\n   - The relevant row for Rik de Voest is:\n     ```json\n     [\n       \"8 april 2013\",\n       \"oklahoma city , usa f9\",\n       \"hard\",\n       \"rik de voest\",\n       \"3 - 6 , 2 - 6\"\n     ]\n     ```\n   - This entry shows that Rik de Voest was an opponent on April 8, 2013, not April 4, 2011.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The table indicates that Arnau Brugu\u00e9s-Davi was the opponent on April 4, 2011.\n   - Rik de Voest was not Alex Bogdanovic's opponent on that date.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table entry for '4 april 2011' lists Arnau Brugu\u00e9s-Davi as the opponent, not Rik de Voest. Additionally, Rik de Voest was an opponent on a different date (8 April 2013). Thus, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
