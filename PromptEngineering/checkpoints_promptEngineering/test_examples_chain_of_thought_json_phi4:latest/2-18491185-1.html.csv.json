According to the table, this is found at the position [0][1].\n\n4. **Compare the Extracted Date with the Claim**:\n   - The date listed in the table for the first episode is \"7 / 02 / 08.\"\n   - Compare this extracted date with the date mentioned in the claim.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the date from the table (\"7 / 02 / 08\") matches the date in the claim, the statement is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cell for verifying this claim is located at row index 0 and column name \"date.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The first episode corresponds to the first row in the data array.

    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, we need to analyze the data provided in the table for any mention of \"episode one\" being aired on \"7 / 21 / 08\". Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: \n   - The table is structured with columns: \"episode\", \"date\", \"time\", \"network\", and \"length\".\n   - Each row represents an airing of an episode, detailing these attributes.\n\n2. **Locate the Claimed Date**:\n   - The claim specifies a date: \"7 / 21 / 08\".\n\n3. **Search for the Episode on This Date**:\n   - We need to find any row where the \"date\" column is \"7 / 21 / 08\".\n   - Check each row's \"date\" value.\n\n4. **Examine the Data**:\n   - Row 0: Date is \"7 / 02 / 08\". This does not match.\n   - Row 1: Date is \"7 / 21 / 08\". This matches, but we need to check the episode number.\n     - Episode here is \"two\".\n   - Row 2: Date is \"7 / 31 / 08\". This does not match.\n   - Row 3: Date is \"8 / 05 / 08\". This does not match.\n   - Row 4: Date is \"8 / 05 / 08\". This does not match.\n\n5. **Verify the Episode Number**:\n   - The only row with the date \"7 / 21 / 08\" has episode number \"two\", not \"one\".\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - There is no row in the table where \"episode one\" is aired on \"7 / 21 / 08\".\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cell for this conclusion is the entry in Row 1, Column \"date\" and Column \"episode\", as it provides the necessary information to evaluate the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the structure of the table.
