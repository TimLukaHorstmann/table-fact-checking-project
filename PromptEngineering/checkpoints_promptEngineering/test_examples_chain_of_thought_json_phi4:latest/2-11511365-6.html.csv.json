The outcome is \"winner\".\n     - This entry matches the date specified in the claim, but the opponent is not \u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin.\n   - **Entry 3:** Date is \"12 September 2010\", opponent is \"Jerzy Janowicz\". The outcome is \"runner-up\".\n     - This entry involves a match in 2010, but again, the opponent is not \u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin.\n\n4. **Check for any mention of \u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin:**\n   - Neither of the entries from 2010 lists \u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin as an opponent.\n   - There are no other entries in the table that involve \u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin, regardless of date.\n\n5. **Conclusion based on analysis:**\n   - The claim states that \u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin only won a game play on \"14 March 2010\". However, he is not mentioned as an opponent on this or any other date in the table.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false because there are no records of \u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin playing or winning in 2010 according to the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that \u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin only won a game play on 14 March 2010.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Vasselin does not play on a hard surface\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the table data provided. We will focus specifically on the \"surface\" column to see if there are any entries indicating that Vasselin played on a \"hard\" surface.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - The claim pertains to the type of playing surface, so we need to look at the \"surface\" column in the table.\n\n2. **Examine Each Entry:**\n   - We will go through each row in the data section and check the value of the \"surface\" column.\n\n3. **Check for Hard Surfaces:**\n   - Look for any instance where the surface is listed as \"hard\" or a variation such as \"hard (i)\".\n\n4. **Analyze Findings:**\n   - If there are any entries with \"hard\" surfaces, the claim will be FALSE.\n   - If no entries have \"hard\" surfaces, the claim will be TRUE.\n\n### Detailed Examination:\n\n- **Row 1:** \n  - Surface: \"clay\"\n  - This does not indicate a hard surface.\n\n- **Row 2:** \n  - Surface: \"hard (i)\"\n  - This indicates a hard surface.\n\n- **Row 3:** \n  - Surface: \"hard\"\n  - This also indicates a hard surface.\n\n- **Row 4:** \n  - Surface: \"hard\"\n  - Again, this is a hard surface.\n\n- **Row 5:** \n  - Surface: \"hard\"\n  - Another instance of a hard surface.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nFrom the examination above, Vasselin played on a hard surface in rows 2, 3, 4, and 5. Therefore, the claim that \"Vasselin does not play on a hard surface\" is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim was evaluated by examining the 'surface' column for any entries labeled as 'hard'.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Vasselin fought hard to win all 5 games\" is TRUE or FALSE, we must analyze each game's outcome from the provided table data.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Number of Matches**:\n   - The table contains five matches with outcomes listed as either \"winner\" or \"runner-up\".\n\n2. **Determine Outcomes of Each Match**:\n   - First Match (27 June 2005, Montauban, France): Vasselin is a winner against Roko Karanu\u0161i\u0107 with a score of 6-4, 6-4.\n     - Since both sets were won without the opponent winning any games in those sets, this match suggests it wasn't particularly hard for Vasselin to win all his games.\n   - Second Match (14 March 2010, Sarajevo): Vasselin is a winner against Karol Beck with a score of 6-7(5), 6-3, 1-0, ret. \n     - The opponent retired during the third set after losing 1-0, implying Vasselin had not yet won all games in this match.\n   - Third Match (12 September 2010, Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence): Vasselin is a runner-up against Jerzy Janowicz with a score of 6-3, 6-7(8), 6-7(8).\n     - As a runner-up, Vasselin did not win this match and thus did not win all games.\n   - Fourth Match (17 July 2011, Granby): Vasselin is a winner against Matthias Bachinger with a score of 7-6(11), 4-6, 6-1.\n     - The first set was won in a tiebreak (close), but the second set was lost. In the third set, he won without dropping games, indicating a clear win for that set.\n   - Fifth Match (11 September 2011, Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence): Vasselin is a winner against Arnaud Cl\u00e9ment with a score of 6-4, 6-3.\n     - Both sets were won straightforwardly without the opponent winning any games in those sets.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - In only one match (the second match) did Vasselin face his opponent until the opponent retired; however, he had not completed all games of that match.\n   - He lost one set in two matches and was a runner-up in another, which means he didn't win every game in all five matches.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim suggests Vasselin won all games in all five matches. However, analyzing the outcomes: In match 1 and 5, he won both sets easily; in match 2, the opponent retired before the third set was completed; in match 3, he lost the match; in match 4, he lost one set.
