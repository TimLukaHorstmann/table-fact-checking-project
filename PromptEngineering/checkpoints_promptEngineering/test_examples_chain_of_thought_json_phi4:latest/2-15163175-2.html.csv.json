    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to analyze the vote share percentages for both the Respect party and the Left List from the provided data.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Locate the Vote Share for Respect Party:**\n   - Find the row corresponding to the \"respect\" party.\n   - According to the table, the \"respect\" party has a vote share of \"2.4%\".\n\n2. **Locate the Vote Share for Left List:**\n   - Find the row corresponding to the \"left list\".\n   - According to the table, the \"left list\" has a vote share of \"0.9%\".\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Vote Share:**\n   - Subtract the vote share of the \"left list\" from that of the \"respect\" party.\n   - Calculation: 2.4% (Respect) - 0.9% (Left List) = 1.5%.\n\n4. **Compare with Claimed Difference:**\n   - The claim states that the Respect party earned 4.5% more in vote share than the Left List.\n   - We calculated a difference of 1.5%, which does not match the claimed 4.5%.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe calculated difference (1.5%) is less than the claimed difference (4.5%). Therefore, the claim that \"the respect party earn 4.5% more of the share of the vote than left list\" is false.\n\nHere are the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- Respect party: Vote share at row index 8, column name \"share\".\n- Left List: Vote share at row index 10, column name \"share\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
