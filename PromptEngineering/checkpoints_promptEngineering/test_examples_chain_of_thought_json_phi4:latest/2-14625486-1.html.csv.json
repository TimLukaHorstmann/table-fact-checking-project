    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the team \"rocketsports\" having a \"qual 2\" time of \"58.385\" is true or false, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Column Headers:**\n   - The table has columns labeled as \"name,\" \"team,\" \"qual 1,\" \"qual 2,\" and \"best.\"\n\n2. **Locate Rows for Team \"rocketsports\":**\n   - We need to find rows where the \"team\" column contains the value \"rocketsports racing.\"\n\n3. **Extract Qual 2 Times:**\n   - For each row corresponding to \"rocketsports racing,\" check the value in the \"qual 2\" column.\n\n4. **Compare with Claimed Value:**\n   - The claim states that the \"qual 2\" time is \"58.385.\" Verify if this matches any of the extracted values for \"rocketsports racing.\"\n\n5. **Verify the Result:**\n   - If there is a row where \"team\" is \"rocketsports racing\" and \"qual 2\" is exactly \"58.385,\" then the claim is true.
