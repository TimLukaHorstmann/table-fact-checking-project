    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about David Lee's performance in March 2011 for the Golden State Warriors is true, we need to analyze the data provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that \"in March 2011, David Lee scored the most rebounds on the Golden State Warrior team.\"\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**: \n   - We are interested in the column labeled \"high rebounds\" for each game played by the Golden State Warriors in March 2011.\n   - We need to check if David Lee had the highest number of rebounds compared to other players in every game.\n\n3. **Examine Each Game**:\n   - For each row (game) in the table, identify who scored the most rebounds and compare it with David Lee's performance.\n\n4. **Analyze Each Entry**:\n\n   - **Game 59**: High rebounds by David Lee (11). Claim holds.\n   - **Game 60**: High rebounds by David Lee (16). Claim holds.\n   - **Game 61**: High rebounds by David Lee (12). Claim holds.\n   - **Game 62**: High rebounds by David Lee (14). Claim holds.\n   - **Game 63**: High rebounds shared between Monta Ellis and David Lee (14 each). Claim holds as he is one of the top rebounders.\n   - **Game 64**: High rebounds by David Lee (10). Claim holds.\n   - **Game 65**: Rebounds shared among Monta Ellis, David Lee, and Dorell Wright (6 each). Claim does not hold as he is not solely the highest rebounder.\n   - **Game 66**: High rebounds by Stephen Curry (9). Claim does not hold.\n   - **Game 67**: Rebounds shared between David Lee and Vladimir Radmanovi\u0107 (4 each). Claim holds as he is one of the top rebounders.\n   - **Game 68**: High rebounds by David Lee (9). Claim holds.\n   - **Game 69**: High rebounds by David Lee (10). Claim holds.\n   - **Game 70**: High rebounds by David Lee (12). Claim holds.\n   - **Game 71**: High rebounds by David Lee (9). Claim holds.\n   - **Game 72**: High rebounds by David Lee (9). Claim holds.\n   - **Game 73**: High rebounds by Monta Ellis (7, but not the highest, shared with others). David Lee has more rebounds (7), so claim holds.\n   - **Game 74**: High rebounds by David Lee (12). Claim holds.\n   - **Game 75**: High rebounds by David Lee (15). Claim holds.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - In most games, David Lee either had the highest rebounds or shared the top spot with others without any single game where another player alone outscored him in rebounds.\n   - The claim is true for all games except Game 65 and Game 66, where he did not have the sole highest rebound count.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states David Lee had the most rebounds for each game in March.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"Golden State played 16 games but only 6 were at home,\" let's analyze the data provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Total Number of Games:**\n   - The table contains 15 game entries, so Golden State played 15 games from March 1 to March 29.\n   - Therefore, the claim that Golden State played 16 games is incorrect based on the provided data.\n\n2. **Identifying Home vs. Away Games:**\n   - To determine whether a game was home or away, we need to look at the \"location attendance\" column and see if it includes the word \"arena,\" which implies a home game for Golden State.\n   - Alternatively, we can check if the \"team\" column indicates that the opposing team is one of Golden State's rivals, implying an away game.\n\n3. **Counting Home Games:**\n   - March 2 vs. Washington (Away)\n   - March 4 vs. Boston (Away)\n   - March 6 vs. Philadelphia (Away)\n   - March 8 vs. Cleveland (Away)\n   - March 9 vs. New Jersey (Away)\n   - March 11 vs. Orlando (Home, Oracle Arena)\n   - March 13 vs. Minnesota (Home, Oracle Arena)\n   - March 14 vs. Sacramento (Away)\n   - March 16 vs. Dallas (Home, Oracle Arena)\n   - March 18 vs. Phoenix (Away)\n   - March 20 vs. Dallas (Away)\n   - March 21 vs. San Antonio (Away)\n   - March 23 vs. Houston (Away)\n   - March 25 vs. Toronto (Home, Oracle Arena)\n   - March 27 vs. Washington (Home, Oracle Arena)\n   - March 29 vs. Oklahoma City (Away)\n\n4. **Result of Home Game Count:**\n   - From the list above, Golden State played home games on:\n     - March 11\n     - March 13\n     - March 16\n     - March 25\n     - March 27\n   - This totals to 5 home games.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim states that Golden State played 16 games but only 6 were at home. \n- Based on the data, they played 15 games and only 5 were at home.\n- Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Golden State played 15 games from March 1 to March 29.
