    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, let's analyze the provided data step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that \"Indiana State and Cincinnati on September 10 draw the least attendance with only 41,382 attending the game.\"\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - We need to check if there is a game involving Indiana State and Cincinnati on September 10.\n   - We also need to verify the attendance numbers for all games listed in the table.\n\n3. **Check the Date**: \n   - The claim mentions the date \"September 10\". However, upon reviewing the data:\n     - There is only one entry with the date \"September 10\":\n       ```json\n       {\n         \"date\": \"september 10\",\n         \"visiting team\": \"no 23 west virginia\",\n         \"home team\": \"marshall\",\n         \"attendance\": 41382\n       }\n       ```\n     - No game involving Indiana State and Cincinnati is listed on September 10.\n\n4. **Locate the Game with Indiana State and Cincinnati**:\n   - Reviewing the data, we find:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"date\": \"september 11\",\n       \"visiting team\": \"indiana state\",\n       \"home team\": \"cincinnati\",\n       \"attendance\": 30807\n     }\n     ```\n   - This game took place on September 11, not September 10.\n\n5. **Compare Attendance Numbers**:\n   - The attendance for the Indiana State vs. Cincinnati game is 30,807.\n   - Other attendance figures from the table are:\n     - West Virginia vs. Marshall (September 10): 41,382\n     - South Florida vs. No. 8 Florida: 90,612\n     - Texas Southern vs. Connecticut: 37,359\n     - New Hampshire vs. Pittsburgh: 50,120\n     - Eastern Kentucky vs. Louisville: 51,427\n     - Syracuse vs. Washington: 62,418\n\n6. **Determine the Least Attendance**:\n   - The least attendance recorded is 30,807 for the Indiana State vs. Cincinnati game on September 11.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim incorrectly states that Indiana State and Cincinnati played on September 10 with an attendance of 41,382.\n   - In reality, their game was on September 11 with a lower attendance than any other listed game (30,807).\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim mentions Indiana State and Cincinnati playing on September 10.\",\n    \"Reviewing the data, no such game is listed on September 10; it occurred on September 11.\",\n    \"The attendance for their game was 30,807, which is less than any other game listed.\",\n    \"The only game on September 10 had an attendance of 41,382, involving West Virginia and Marshall.\",\n    \"Therefore, the claim about the date and attendance is incorrect.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
