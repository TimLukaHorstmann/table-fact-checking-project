According to the data, it appears in row index 0.\n\n2. **Verify Location and Country:**\n   - Check if \"The National Stadium\" is located in Cardiff, Wales:\n     - Row index 0 has \"city\": \"cardiff\"\n     - Row index 0 has \"country\": \"wales\"\n   - This part of the claim matches the table data.\n\n3. **Verify Closure Year and Capacity:**\n   - Check if it closed in 1997 with a capacity of 53,000:\n     - Row index 0 has \"closed\": 1997\n     - Row index 0 has \"capacity (at time of closure)\": 53000\n   - Both the year of closure and capacity match the claim.\n\n4. **Verify If It Is The Largest Among Those Closed in 1997:**\n   - We need to ensure no other stadium closed in 1997 had a larger capacity.\n   - From the table data, only \"The National Stadium\" has \"closed\": 1997.\n   - No other entry for 1997 exists in the table.\n\n5. **Confirm It Was a Rugby Union Stadium:**\n   - The claim specifies it was a rugby union stadium. Although the table doesn't explicitly mention the type of sport associated with each stadium, \"The National Stadium\" is historically known as a rugby venue. Therefore, this assumption aligns with common knowledge.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- All parts of the claim are verified against the table data:\n  - The location and country match.\n  - The year of closure and capacity match.\n  - It was indeed closed in 1997, and no other stadium matches or exceeds its capacity for that year.\n  - Common knowledge supports it being a rugby union stadium.\n\nThus, based on the verification process above, the claim is true. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The National Stadium is located at row index 0 in the table, which matches Cardiff, Wales as stated.

From the data provided:\n     - Row 1 corresponds to \"lansdowne road\" with a capacity of 49,000 and closed in 2007.\n\n2. **Check Capacity Criteria:**\n   - The claim specifies that we are interested in stadiums with a capacity over 10,000. We need to verify if the stadium(s) identified in step 1 meets this criterion.\n   - \"lansdowne road\" has a capacity of 49,000 which is indeed greater than 10,000.\n\n3. **Check Closure Criteria:**\n   - The claim also specifies that these stadiums must have closed. As per the data:\n     - \"lansdowne road\" was closed in 2007.\n\n4. **Determine if it's the Only One:**\n   - We need to ensure there are no other entries for Irish stadiums with a capacity over 10,000 that were also closed.\n   - Reviewing all rows, only \"lansdowne road\" (Row 1) meets all criteria of being in Ireland, having a capacity over 10,000, and being closed.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since no other stadium in the dataset matches these conditions for Ireland, \"lansdowne road\" is indeed the only rugby union stadium in Ireland with a capacity over 10,000 that has closed.\n\nBased on this reasoning process, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified 'lansdowne road' as the Irish stadium from the dataset.

We need to compare its stated capacity (53,000) against all other listed stadiums' capacities.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- **Step 1: Verify \"The National Stadium\" Details**: \n  - From the table, \"the national stadium\" in Cardiff has a capacity of 53,000 and closed in 1997.\n  \n- **Step 2: Check Claimed Capacity**:\n  - The claim states the capacity was 10,887 at closure.
