    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two conditions for each entry in the table:\n\n1. The position should be larger than 3.\n2. The number of games played should be smaller than 14.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Columns**: We need to focus on the \"position\" and \"played\" columns since these are mentioned in the claim.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - For each row, check if the position is greater than 3.\n   - Check if the number of games played is less than 14.\n\n3. **Evaluate Each Entry**:\n\n   - **Row 1**: \n     - Position: 1 (not > 3)\n     - Played: 14 (not < 14)\n     - This row fails both conditions.\n\n   - **Row 2**: \n     - Position: 2 (not > 3)\n     - Played: 14 (not < 14)\n     - This row fails both conditions.\n\n   - **Row 3**:\n     - Position: 3 (not > 3)\n     - Played: 14 (not < 14)\n     - This row fails both conditions.\n\n   - **Row 4**:\n     - Position: 4 (> 3) \n     - Played: 14 (not < 14)\n     - This row fails the second condition.\n\n   - **Row 5**:\n     - Position: 5 (> 3)\n     - Played: 14 (not < 14)\n     - This row fails the second condition.\n\n   - **Row 6**:\n     - Position: 6 (> 3)\n     - Played: 14 (not < 14)\n     - This row fails the second condition.\n\n   - **Row 7**:\n     - Position: 7 (> 3)\n     - Played: 14 (not < 14)\n     - This row fails the second condition.\n\n   - **Row 8**:\n     - Position: 8 (> 3)\n     - Played: 14 (not < 14)\n     - This row fails the second condition.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since none of the rows satisfy both conditions simultaneously, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells are those in the \"position\" and \"played\" columns for each row because they directly pertain to the conditions being checked.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We need to check if all entries have a position larger than 3 and played games smaller than 14.
