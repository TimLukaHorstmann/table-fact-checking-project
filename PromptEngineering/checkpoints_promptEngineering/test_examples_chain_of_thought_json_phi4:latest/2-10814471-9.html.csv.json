    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Tevita Vaikona scored 100 points on 25 tries\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - We look for the row corresponding to \"tevita vaikona\".\n   \n2. **Extract Data:**\n   - Locate \"tevita vaikona\" in the \"player\" column:\n     ```json\n     [\n       \"tevita vaikona\",\n       \"wing\",\n       25,\n       0,\n       100\n     ]\n     ```\n   - This is at `row_index` 1 (considering 0-based indexing).\n\n3. **Verify Tries and Points:**\n   - Check the value in the \"tries\" column for this row:\n     - The number of tries is 25.\n   - Check the value in the \"points\" column for this row:\n     - The total points scored are 100.\n\n4. **Assess Claim Validity:**\n   - According to rugby scoring rules, a try typically scores 4 points (assuming no additional conversions).\n   - Calculate the maximum points from tries alone:\n     \\[\n     25 \\text{ tries} \\times 4 \\text{ points per try} = 100 \\text{ points}\n     \\]\n   - The data shows that \"tevita vaikona\" has scored exactly 100 points through 25 tries, with no additional goals contributing to the score.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since all 100 points are accounted for by 25 tries, the claim is consistent with the table data and rugby scoring rules.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Tevita Vaikona's row shows 25 tries and 100 points. Each try scores 4 points, so 25 tries result in exactly 100 points.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Tevita Vaikona be the only player to score at least 100 points when make more than 23 tries\" is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Players with More Than 23 Tries:**\n   - We examine each row in the data for players who have scored more than 23 tries.\n\n2. **Check Points for These Players:**\n   - For each player identified with more than 23 tries, check if they have scored at least 100 points.\n\n3. **Verify Uniqueness:**\n   - Confirm that Tevita Vaikona is the only player meeting both criteria (more than 23 tries and at least 100 points).\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Players with More Than 23 Tries:**\n   - Review each row in the \"data\" section of the table:\n     - Robbie Paul: 23 tries\n     - Tevita Vaikona: 25 tries\n     - Leon Pryce: 16 tries\n     - Nathan Mcavoy: 4 tries\n     - Michael Withers: 31 tries\n     - Henry Paul: 9 tries\n     - Paul Deacon: 6 tries\n     - Joe Vagana: 2 tries\n     - James Lowes: 13 tries\n     - Paul Anderson: 8 tries\n     - Daniel Gartner: 14 tries\n     - Mike Forshaw: 6 tries\n     - Lee Gilmour: 8 tries\n     - Shane Rigon: 12 tries\n     - Alex Wilkinson: 0 tries\n     - Lee Radford: 2 tries\n     - Jamie Peacock: 8 tries\n     - Scott Naylor: 14 tries\n     - Brian McDermott: 3 tries\n     - Graham Mackay: 12 tries\n     - Paul Sykes: 0 tries\n     - Rob Parker: 0 tries\n     - Stuart Spruce: 6 tries\n     - Stuart Fielden: 3 tries\n\n   - Players with more than 23 tries:\n     - Tevita Vaikona: 25 tries (row index 1)\n     - Michael Withers: 31 tries (row index 4)\n\n2. **Check Points for These Players:**\n   - Tevita Vaikona has 100 points.\n   - Michael Withers has 124 points.\n\n3. **Verify Uniqueness:**\n   - Both Tevita Vaikona and Michael Withers have more than 23 tries.\n   - Both players also have at least 100 points.\n   - Therefore, Tevita Vaikona is not the only player meeting both criteria.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there are two players (Tevita Vaikona and Michael Withers) who have scored at least 100 points with more than 23 tries.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified players with more than 23 tries: Tevita Vaikona and Michael Withers.
