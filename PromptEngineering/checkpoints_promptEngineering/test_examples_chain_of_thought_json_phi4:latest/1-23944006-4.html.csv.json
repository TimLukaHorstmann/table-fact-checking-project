We will follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row**: \n   - The claim specifies the event location as San Diego in the year 2002.\n   - Review the table to locate the row that matches this description.\n\n2. **Check Year and Championship Columns**:\n   - Locate entries with \"year\" equal to 2002 and \"championship\" equal to \"san diego\".\n   - According to the table, there is one such entry in the second row (index 1).\n\n3. **Verify Surface and Partner Details**:\n   - Confirm additional details like \"surface\" as \"hard\" and \"partner\" as \"ai sugiyama\", which align with the identified San Diego event.\n   - These match with the entry at index 1.\n\n4. **Check Opponents' Names**:\n   - The opponents listed in the claim should be checked against the table's data for consistency.\n   - For the San Diego event, opponents are \"conchita mart\u00ednez virginia ruano pascual\" which matches the entry at index 1.\n\n5. **Verify Score**:\n   - Compare the score provided in the claim (\"7 - 6 (9 - 7), 1 - 6, 5 - 7\") with the \"score\" column for this row.\n   - The table lists the score as \"7 - 6 (9 - 7), 1 - 6, 5 - 7\", which matches exactly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on these steps, all details in the claim align perfectly with the data from the relevant row in the table.

    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, let's analyze the data provided step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Key Elements of the Claim:**\n   - The claim pertains to a championship held in San Diego.\n   - It specifies that the event took place on a hard surface.\n   - It states the year as 2009.\n   - It gives a score of \"3 - 6, 6 - 3, 6 - 1.\"\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Data:**\n   - We need to find entries in the table that match the location (\"San Diego\"), surface (\"hard\"), and year (2009).\n\n3. **Examine Each Row for Matches:**\n   - Look at each row's \"year,\" \"championship,\" and \"surface\" columns.\n   - The claim involves the San Diego championship, so we specifically look for entries with \"San Diego.\"\n\n4. **Check Entries for San Diego Championships:**\n   - **Row 1**: Year = 2002, Championship = Berlin, Surface = Clay (Does not match)\n   - **Row 2**: Year = 2002, Championship = San Diego, Surface = Hard (Year does not match 2009)\n   - **Row 3**: Year = 2005, Championship = Zurich, Surface = Hard (i) (Neither matches San Diego nor year 2009)\n   - **Row 4**: Year = 2006, Championship = Rome, Surface = Clay (Does not match)\n   - **Row 5**: Year = 2009, Championship = Rome, Surface = Clay (Championship does not match)\n   - **Row 6**: Year = 2009, Championship = Tokyo, Surface = Hard (Championship does not match)\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - There is no entry in the table for a San Diego championship on a hard surface in 2009.\n   - Therefore, it's impossible to have any score related to such an event as described in the claim.\n\n6. **Determine the Truth Value of the Claim:**\n   - Since there is no record of a San Diego championship on a hard surface in 2009, the claim is false.\n\n7. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells are those related to the \"championship\" column for all entries since they help verify that no entry matches the criteria given in the claim.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim pertains to a San Diego championship on a hard surface in 2009 with a specific score. Upon examining each row, no entry matches all these conditions simultaneously. Thus, there is no record of such an event in the given data.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"championship\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"championship\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"championship\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"championship\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"championship\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"championship\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
