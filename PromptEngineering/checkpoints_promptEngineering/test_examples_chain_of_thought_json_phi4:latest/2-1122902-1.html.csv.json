Here's a step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify Elio de Angelis' Performance:**\n   - Locate Elio de Angelis in the table by matching his name.\n   - In row 18, we find Elio de Angelis with the following details:\n     - Laps completed: 25\n     - Reason for retirement: Turbo\n     - Grid position: 23\n\n2. **Determine What \"Fastest\" Means:**\n   - In racing terminology, \"fastest driver\" typically refers to the driver who completes the race in the shortest time or finishes in first place.\n   - Alternatively, it can mean achieving the fastest lap time during the race.\n\n3. **Check for Race Completion and Position:**\n   - Look at the drivers who completed the most laps (67) to see if Elio de Angelis finished in a leading position.\n   - The top three finishers are:\n     1. Alain Prost (Mclaren-TAG) with a time of 1:35:13.284, grid position 2\n     2. Michele Alboreto (Ferrari) with +23.911 seconds behind the leader, grid position 5\n     3.
