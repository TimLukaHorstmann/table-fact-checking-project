It claims there are 13 actors with the longest service on \"Un posto al sole.\"\n2.

Specifically, we'll focus on Marina Tagliaferri (Giulia Poggi) and Claudia Ruffo (Angela Poggi), as they are mentioned in the claim.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**:\n   - We need to look for rows that indicate an actor left a show and returned later. This is typically indicated by a range of years with breaks in between, such as \"1996 - 2008 , 2010-\" or similar formats.\n\n2. **Examine Marina Tagliaferri (Giulia Poggi)**:\n   - Row: `[9]`\n     - Years: `\"1996 - 2008 , 2011-\"`\n     - This indicates that Marina Tagliaferri left the show in 2008 and returned in 2011.\n\n3. **Examine Claudia Ruffo (Angela Poggi)**:\n   - Row: `[10]`\n     - Years: `\"1996 - 2007 , 2010-\"`\n     - This indicates that Claudia Ruffo left the show in 2007 and returned in 2010.\n\n4. **Check for Other Actors with Similar Patterns**:\n   - We need to verify if there are any other actors who have left and returned, as the claim states they are \"the only\" ones.\n   - Go through each row to check for similar patterns of leaving and returning:\n     - Rows `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`, `[4]`, `[5]`, `[6]`, `[7]`, `[8]`, `[11]`, `[12]`, `[13]`, `[14]`, `[15]`, `[16]`, `[17]` do not show any breaks in their years of participation.\n     - Row `[18]`: \"delia boccardo\" (Tilly Nardi) has a continuous range from 1998 to 2008, indicating no return after leaving.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Only Marina Tagliaferri and Claudia Ruffo have shown a pattern of leaving and returning.\n   - Therefore, the claim that \"Giulia and Angela Poggi, played by Marina Tagliaferri and Claudia Ruffo respectively, be the only actors to leave the show and return year later\" is true based on the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
