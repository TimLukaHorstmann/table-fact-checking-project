    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"1 of the judge be appoint by luis fortu\u00f1o\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data for any judges appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that exactly one judge was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o. We must verify this against the table data.\n\n2. **Identify the Relevant Column**: The column \"appointed by\" contains information about who appointed each judge, which is crucial for evaluating the claim.\n\n3. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - For each row in the data, check the value under the \"appointed by\" column to see if it matches \"luis fortu\u00f1o\".\n   - Count the number of rows where this condition is true.\n\n4. **Count Appointments by Luis Fortu\u00f1o**:\n   - Row 2: \"edgardo rivera garcia\", appointed by \"luis fortu\u00f1o\"\n   - Row 3: \"erick kolthoff caraballo\", appointed by \"luis fortu\u00f1o\"\n   - Row 6: \"luis estrella mart\u00ednez\", appointed by \"luis fortu\u00f1o\"\n   - Row 7: \"mildred pab\u00f3n charneco\", appointed by \"luis fortu\u00f1o\"\n   - Row 8: \"rafael mart\u00ednez torres\", appointed by \"luis fortu\u00f1o\"\n   - Row 9: \"roberto feliberti cintr\u00f3n\", appointed by \"luis fortu\u00f1o\"\n\n5. **Determine the Total**: There are six judges listed as being appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim**: The claim states that only one judge was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o, but we found that six judges were appointed by him. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that exactly one judge was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.
