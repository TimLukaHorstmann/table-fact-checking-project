Here's a step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Players**: The claim mentions two players: Lee Janzen and Craig Stadler.\n\n2. **Check Placement (\"place\")**:\n   - Look for entries where the \"player\" is either Lee Janzen or Craig Stadler.\n   - Check if their \"place\" column matches \"t4\".\n\n3. **Verify Score**: \n   - Ensure that both players have a score of 67.\n\n4. **Examine Rows**:\n   - For Lee Janzen, locate the row where \"player\" is \"lee janzen\".\n     - Row: [ \"t4\", \"lee janzen\", \"united states\", 67, \"- 3\" ]\n     - Verify \"place\": \"t4\"\n     - Verify \"score\": 67\n   - For Craig Stadler, locate the row where \"player\" is \"craig stadler\".\n     - Row: [ \"t4\", \"craig stadler\", \"united states\", 67, \"- 3\" ]\n     - Verify \"place\": \"t4\"\n     - Verify \"score\": 67\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Both Lee Janzen and Craig Stadler are listed at place \"t4\" with a score of 67.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is true.
