    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"only 1 person have be a member of the socialist party of albania\" is true or false, we need to examine the table data for any entries associated with the Socialist Party of Albania.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Entries by Political Party:**\n   - We will look through each row in the \"data\" array and check the column labeled \"political party\" to see if it contains the entry \"socialist party of albania\".\n\n2. **Examine Each Relevant Entry:**\n\n   - Row 3: Ylli Bufi is associated with the Socialist Party of Albania.\n   - Row 6: Bashkim Fino is associated with the Socialist Party of Albania.\n   - Row 7: Fatos Nano (2nd time) is associated with the Socialist Party of Albania.\n   - Row 8: Pandeli Majko (1st time) is associated with the Socialist Party of Albania.\n   - Row 9: Ilir Meta is associated with the Socialist Party of Albania.\n   - Row 10: Pandeli Majko (2nd time) is associated with the Socialist Party of Albania.\n   - Row 11: Fatos Nano (3rd time) is associated with the Socialist Party of Albania.\n   - Row 13: Edi Rama is currently associated with the Socialist Party of Albania.\n\n3. **Count the Number of Unique Individuals:**\n   - From the examination, we find that there are multiple individuals who have been members of the Socialist Party of Albania:\n     - Ylli Bufi\n     - Bashkim Fino\n     - Fatos Nano (appears 2 times)\n     - Pandeli Majko (appears 2 times)\n     - Ilir Meta\n     - Edi Rama\n\n4. **Determine the Validity of the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that only one person has been a member of the Socialist Party of Albania, but our analysis shows that there are at least seven unique individuals who have been members.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is false because more than one person has been a member of the Socialist Party of Albania.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 3, Column \"political party\"\n- Row 6, Column \"political party\"\n- Row 7, Column \"political party\"\n- Row 8, Column \"political party\"\n- Row 9, Column \"political party\"\n- Row 10, Column \"political party\"\n- Row 11, Column \"political party\"\n- Row 13, Column \"political party\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify entries by political party.\",\n    \"Examine each relevant entry for 'socialist party of albania'.\",\n    \"List individuals: Ylli Bufi, Bashkim Fino, Fatos Nano (twice), Pandeli Majko (twice), Ilir Meta, Edi Rama.\",\n    \"Count unique individuals: Seven unique people have been members.\",\n    \"The claim is false as more than one person has been a member.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
