    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the data provided in the table concerning the overall pick numbers for Andrew Carnahan and Chad Nkang.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data Points:**\n   - We are concerned with two players: \"Andrew Carnahan\" and \"Chad Nkang.\"\n   - Their overall pick numbers need to be compared according to the claim.\n\n2. **Locate Andrew Carnahan's Record in the Table:**\n   - Look for a row where the name is \"Andrew Carnahan.\"\n   - This can be found at row index 10 (7th row in human-readable format, as indexing starts from zero).\n   - In this row, under the column \"overall,\" the number listed is 252.\n\n3. **Locate Chad Nkang's Record in the Table:**\n   - Look for a row where the name is \"Chad Nkang.\"\n   - This can be found at row index 9 (6th row in human-readable format).\n   - In this row, under the column \"overall,\" the number listed is also 251.\n\n4. **Compare Overall Pick Numbers:**\n   - Andrew Carnahan's overall pick number is 252.\n   - Chad Nkang's overall pick number is 251.\n   - According to the claim, Andrew Carnahan should have the highest overall of 252 and be followed by Chad Nkang.\n   - Since 252 is greater than 251, this order is correct based on their overall pick numbers.\n\n5. **Verify the Order in the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"Andrew Carnahan has the highest overall of 252, follow by Chad Nkang.\"\n   - This matches our findings: Andrew Carnahan (252) indeed follows Chad Nkang (251) when ordered from lower to higher overall pick numbers.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is accurate based on the data provided in the table.
