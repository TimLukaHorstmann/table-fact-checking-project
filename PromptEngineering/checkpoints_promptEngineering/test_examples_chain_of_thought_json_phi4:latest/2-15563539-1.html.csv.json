    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to verify two parts:\n1. Whether \"John H. Vandenbosch\" is listed as the treasurer on the socialist ticket.\n2. Whether \"George K. Shuler\" is listed as governor on the democratic ticket.\n\nLet's analyze these steps based on the given table:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n#### Step 1: Verify John H. Vandenbosch as Treasurer on Socialist Ticket\n- **Column to Check:** \"socialist ticket\"\n- **Row for Treasurer:** The data row corresponding to the position of \"treasurer\" is the sixth row (index 5, considering zero-based indexing).\n- **Relevant Cell:** In this row, under the \"socialist ticket\" column, we find \"John H. Vandenbosch\".\n\n#### Step 2: Verify George K. Shuler as Governor on Democratic Ticket\n- **Column to Check:** \"democratic ticket\"\n- **Row for Governor:** The data row corresponding to the position of \"governor\" is the first row (index 0, considering zero-based indexing).\n- **Relevant Cell:** In this row, under the \"democratic ticket\" column, we find \"George K. Shuler\".\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth parts of the claim are verified:\n1. John H. Vandenbosch is indeed listed as treasurer on the socialist ticket.\n2. George K.
