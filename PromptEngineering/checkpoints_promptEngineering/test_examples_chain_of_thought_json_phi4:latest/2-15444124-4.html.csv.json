    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to check each year's data where assists are less than 1 (i.e., either 0 or not played) and verify if the corresponding goals (\"g\") for those years are always 0.\n\nLet's break down the table:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Year 1996**: \n   - Assists = 2\n   - Goals = 3\n   - Since assists are not less than 1, we do not consider this year for our claim.\n\n2. **Year 1997**:\n   - Assists = 1\n   - Goals = 1\n   - Again, assists are not less than 1, so we skip this year.\n\n3. **Year 1998**:\n   - Assists = 0 (less than 1)\n   - Goals = 0\n   - This satisfies the claim since goals are indeed 0 when assists are less than 1.\n\n4. **Year 1999**:\n   - Assists = 4\n   - We do not consider this year as assists are not less than 1.\n\n5. **Year 2000**:\n   - Assists = did not play (interpreted as 0)\n   - Goals = did not play (interpreted as 0)\n   - This satisfies the claim since both goals and assists are effectively 0.\n\n6. **Year 2001**:\n   - Assists = did not play (interpreted as 0)\n   - Goals = did not play (interpreted as 0)\n   - This satisfies the claim, with both values being effectively 0.\n\n7. **Year 2002**:\n   - Assists = 0 (less than 1)\n   - Goals = 1\n   - This does not satisfy the claim since goals are not 0 when assists are less than 1.\n\n8. **Year 2003**:\n   - Assists = did not play (interpreted as 0)\n   - Goals = did not play (interpreted as 0)\n   - This satisfies the claim, with both values being effectively 0.\n\n9. **Year 2004**:\n   - Assists = did not play (interpreted as 0)\n   - Goals = did not play (interpreted as 0)\n   - This satisfies the claim, with both values being effectively 0.\n\n10. **Year 2005**:\n    - Assists = 0 (less than 1)\n    - Goals = 4\n    - This does not satisfy the claim since goals are not 0 when assists are less than 1.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is FALSE because in years 2002 and 2005, where assists were less than 1, the number of goals was not 0. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Year 1996: Assists = 2 (not less than 1), Goals = 3.

However:\n- In the year 2003, \"Goals\" is also marked as \"did not play.\"\n- The table does not provide any explicit number of goals for this scenario; instead, it uses \"did not play.\"\n\n### Step 4: Consider Other Relevant Instances\n\nWe should check if there are other years where \"Total Points\" is \"did not play\" to ensure consistency:\n- Year 2000\n- Year 2001\n- Year 2003 (already checked)\n- Year 2004\n\nFor each of these years, the relevant data shows:\n- Goals: did not play\n- Total Points: did not play\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn all instances where \"Total Points\" is marked as \"did not play,\" \"Goals\" is also marked as \"did not play.\" There are no instances where it explicitly states 1 goal.\n\nThus, the claim that when \"Total Points\" is marked as \"did not play,\" there should always be 1 goal, is false based on the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim suggests a correlation between 'Total Points' being 'did not play' and having exactly 1 goal.
