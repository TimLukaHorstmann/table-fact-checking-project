In football league standings, if two teams are tied on points, the next criteria often used to differentiate them is their head-to-head record (wins, draws, losses) against each other.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Points for Both Teams**:\n   - According to the table, both CA Osasuna and Real Murcia have 50 points.\n     - CA Osasuna: \"44 + 6\" = 50 points\n     - Real Murcia: \"47 + 9\" = 56 points (Note: There seems to be a discrepancy here as per our calculation. Let's assume the point system is consistent and re-evaluate based on head-to-head.)\n\n2. **Evaluate Head-to-Head Record**:\n   - The claim states CA Osasuna have a \"draw on win.\" This means in their direct matches, they either won more games than Real Murcia or had the same number of wins but more draws.\n   - Unfortunately, the table does not provide direct head-to-head results. We need to infer based on typical league procedures.\n\n3. **Check for Other Tiebreakers**:\n   - If CA Osasuna and Real Murcia are tied in points, the next tiebreaker is usually goal difference.\n     - CA Osasuna: \"+ 25\"\n     - Real Murcia: \"+ 19\"\n   - CA Osasuna has a superior goal difference.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since CA Osasuna has both more points and a better goal difference, they would not be tied with Real Murcia in the standings.\n   - The claim about having a \"draw on win\" is irrelevant because they are not tied based on the given data.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the claim is false.

This can be found at index 3 (since JSON indexing starts from zero).\n\n3. **Extract Goal Against Data**: In the identified row for \"elche cf\", locate the column named \"goals against.\"\n\n4. **Analyze Value**: The value in the \"goals against\" column for \"elche cf\" is 41.\n\n5. **Evaluate Claim**: The claim states that \"elche cf have fewer than 40 goal against other team.\" We need to check if 41 is indeed less than 40.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since 41 is not fewer than 40, the statement is false.\n\nNow, we compile our findings into a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate 'elche cf' in the table, which is at row index 3.
