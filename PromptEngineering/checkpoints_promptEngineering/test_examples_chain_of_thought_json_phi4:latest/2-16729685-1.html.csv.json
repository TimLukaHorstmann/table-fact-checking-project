    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify several components of the claim by referring to specific entries in the data:\n\n1. **Identify the artist \"Maggie Toal\":**\n   - We will look through the \"artist\" column to find any entry for \"maggie toal\".\n\n2. **Verify the draw number:**\n   - Once we locate \"maggie toal\", we check her associated \"draw\" number to see if it is 7.\n\n3. **Check the song title:**\n   - For the same row, verify that the \"song\" column corresponds to \"feed him with love\".\n\n4. **Correct any discrepancies in phrasing or spelling:**\n   - The claim mentions \"fee him with love\", which seems like a typographical error for \"feed him with love\". We should check for this specific title as it is written.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n1. **Locate \"Maggie Toal\":**\n   - By examining the data, we find that in row index 6 (0-based index), the artist is \"maggie toal\".\n\n2. **Verify the draw number:**\n   - In row index 6, the \"draw\" column value is 7.\n\n3. **Check the song title:**\n   - In row index 6, the \"song\" column has the entry \"feed him with love\", which matches the intended meaning of \"fee him with love\".\n\nSince all parts of the claim match the data in row index 6:\n\n- Artist: \"maggie toal\"\n- Draw number: 7\n- Song title (correcting for a typo): \"feed him with love\"\n\nThe claim is therefore TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, I identified the artist 'Maggie Toal' in the data. Next, I verified her draw number to ensure it was 7. Then, I checked the song title for any typographical errors and confirmed it as 'feed him with love'.
