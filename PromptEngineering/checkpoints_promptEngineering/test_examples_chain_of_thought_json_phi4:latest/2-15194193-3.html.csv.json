This is a relevant instance since there's one win in the `500cc` class.\n   - In 1970, again for the `\"500cc\"` class with `\"linto\"`, it scored `30` points and had `0` wins.\n\n3. **Analyze MV Agusta's Entries**:\n   - In 1971, the `\"500cc\"` class with `\"mv agusta\"` team scored `29` points and had `1` win.\n   - In 1972, for the `\"500cc\"` class with `\"mv agusta\"`, it scored `87` points and also had `1` win.\n\n4. **Check for Non-500cc Wins**:\n   - For Linto: All recorded wins are in the `500cc` class.\n   - For MV Agusta: All recorded wins are also in the `500cc` class, but it's crucial to note that \"Alberto Pagan\" isn't directly linked with either team from the table itself.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim focuses on all of Alberto Pagan's wins being in the 500cc class.\n   - While we observe wins only for `Linto` and `MV Agusta` in the `500cc` class, there is no direct reference to \"Alberto Pagan\" owning or representing these teams within the table data itself.

From the context, we'll assume that wins under \"mv agusta\" are attributed to him.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Data**:\n   - Look for entries in the table where the team is \"mv agusta\".\n   - Check if any of these entries have a non-zero value in the \"wins\" column, indicating a win.\n   \n3. **Checking Each Year for Wins by Alberto Pagani**:\n   - **1971**: \n     - Check the rows with `team` as \"mv agusta\":\n       - Row 21: `\"year\": 1971`, `\"class\": \"500cc\"`, `\"team\": \"mv agusta\"`, `\"points\": 29`, `\"wins\": 1`\n     - This indicates one win in 1971 for \"mv agusta\".\n   - **Other Years**:\n     - For completeness, check other years for any wins by \"mv agusta\":\n       - Row 2: `\"year\": 1960`, `\"class\": \"125cc\"`, `\"team\": \"mv agusta\"`, `\"points\": 0`, `\"wins\": 0`\n       - Row 22: `\"year\": 1972`, `\"class\": \"500cc\"`, `\"team\": \"mv agusta\"`, `\"points\": 87`, `\"wins\": 1`\n\n4. **Analyzing the Wins**:\n   - In 1971, there are two entries for \"mv agusta\":\n     - One win in the \"250cc\" class (Row 21)\n     - One win in the \"500cc\" class (Row 20)\n   - In other years with \"mv agusta\", only one win is recorded per year:\n     - 1960: No wins\n     - 1972: One win\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Alberto Pagani, associated with \"mv agusta\", won twice in the same year (1971) and did not win more than once in any other year.\n   - Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim, we identified rows where 'team' is 'mv agusta'.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Alberto Pagani's wins is true, we need to analyze the provided data table. Here are the steps of reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Wins:**\n   - We need to find entries where \"wins\" is greater than 0 because a win requires at least one victory.\n   \n2. **Filter by Class:**\n   - The claim specifies that all wins should be in the \"500cc\" class.\n\n3. **Calculate Average Points for Wins:**\n   - For each win, check the points scored and calculate the average of these points to see if it matches 87.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Locate Entries with Wins Greater Than Zero:**\n   - From the data:\n     - Row 18 (1969): \"500cc\", \"linto\", 15 points, 1 win.\n     - Row 23 (1971): \"500cc\", \"linto\", 29 points, 1 win.\n     - Row 24 (1971): \"500cc\", \"mv agusta\", 29 points, 1 win.\n     - Row 25 (1972): \"500cc\", \"mv agusta\", 87 points, 1 win.\n\n2. **Verify Class for Each Win:**\n   - All identified entries with wins are indeed in the \"500cc\" class.\n\n3. **Calculate Average Points for Wins:**\n   - Calculate the average of the points from these entries:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average} = \\frac{15 + 29 + 29 + 87}{4} = \\frac{160}{4} = 40\n     \\]\n   - The calculated average is 40, not 87.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim states that all of Alberto Pagani's wins were in the \"500cc\" class with an average point score of 87. While it is true that all his wins were in the \"500cc\" class, the average points scored across these wins is 40, not 87.

In the table, the column \"wins\" indicates whether a race was won (0 means no win).\n\n3. **Filter 250cc Class Data**:\n   - From the data provided, filter entries where `class` is \"250cc\":\n     - 1960: team \"aermacchi\", points 2, wins 0\n     - 1961: team \"aermacchi\", points 0, wins 0\n     - 1964: team \"paton\", points 6, wins 0\n     - 1965: team \"aermacchi\", points 1, wins 0\n     - 1966: team \"aermacchi\", points 4, wins 0\n     - 1970: team \"aermacchi\", points 4, wins 0\n\n4. **Determine Wins by Alberto Pagani**: \n   - The table does not specify the rider for each entry, so we need to rely on historical context or external knowledge if available.\n   - However, based solely on the data provided, there are no entries where \"wins\" is greater than 0 in the \"250cc\" class.\n\n5. **Calculate Average Points**:\n   - Since there are no recorded wins (i.e., `wins` column is 0 for all 250cc entries), we cannot calculate an average of points per win.\n   - An average requires at least one non-zero value to be meaningful, which in this case would be the points corresponding to a race that was won.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states Alberto Pagani averaged 40 points in races he won in the 250cc class.\n   - Based on the data provided, there are no recorded wins for any team in the 250cc class, thus making it impossible to calculate an average based on the given dataset.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, we conclude that the claim cannot be substantiated with the available data as there are no recorded wins for the \"250cc\" class.
