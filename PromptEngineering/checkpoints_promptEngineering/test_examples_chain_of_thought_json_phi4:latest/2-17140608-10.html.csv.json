Specifically, we will focus on the column \"high points\" across all seven game entries.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Column and Data**:\n   - We are interested in the \"high points\" column for each game entry, which indicates who scored the highest points in a particular game.\n   \n2. **Examine Each Game Entry**:\n   - **Game 76 (April 1)**: Paul Pierce is listed with 32 points as the high scorer.\n   - **Game 77 (April 3)**: Paul Pierce is again the high scorer with 21 points.\n   - **Game 78 (April 8)**: Rajon Rondo scored the highest with 31 points, not Paul Pierce.\n   - **Game 79 (April 10)**: Paul Pierce had 28 points, making him the high scorer.\n   - **Game 80 (April 12)**: Paul Pierce scored 14 points and was the high scorer in this game.\n   - **Game 81 (April 14)**: Paul Pierce led with 31 points as the high scorer.\n   - **Game 82 (April 15)**: Glen Davis had 21 points, making him the high scorer, not Paul Pierce.\n\n3. **Count the Number of Games Led by Paul Pierce**:\n   - From the examination above, we see that Paul Pierce led in scoring for games 76, 77, 79, 80, and 81.\n   - This totals to 5 games where he was the high scorer.\n\n4. **Compare with the Claim**:\n   - The claim states Paul Pierce led in points for \"5 of the 7 games.\"\n   - Our analysis confirms that this is indeed true as he led in scoring for exactly 5 out of the 7 games listed.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is accurate based on the data provided.
