    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"pat harrison sign with the dodger in 1969\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the relevant data from the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - We are looking for information about \"Pat Harrison.\"\n   - From the table's data:\n     ```json\n     [\n       [\"round\", \"name\", \"position\", \"school\", \"signed\"],\n       [1, \"pat harrison\", \"inf\", \"university of southern california\", \"no\"]\n     ]\n     ```\n   - The row with \"Pat Harrison\" is in the first position (row index 0).\n\n2. **Check the 'Signed' Column:**\n   - For Pat Harrison, the \"signed\" column contains \"no.\"\n   - This indicates that Pat Harrison did not sign with any team.\n\n3. **Verify Against Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Pat Harrison signed with the Dodgers in 1969.\n   - Since the table explicitly shows \"no\" for signing, it means he did not sign with any team, including the Dodgers.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the data, the claim is false because Pat Harrison did not sign with any team according to the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The row corresponding to 'Pat Harrison' shows that he did not sign with any team ('no'). Therefore, the claim that he signed with the Dodgers in 1969 is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"signed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to analyze the given table data to check if the only non-pitcher drafted was indeed the last player.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Pitchers:**\n   - From baseball terminology, pitchers are often referred to as \"rhp\" (right-handed pitcher) or \"lhp\" (left-handed pitcher).\n   - In the table:\n     - Row 2: William Camp is a \"rhp\", indicating he is a pitcher.\n     - Row 3: George Pugh is an \"lhp\", indicating he is also a pitcher.\n\n2. **Identify Non-Pitchers:**\n   - The other positions listed in the table are non-pitching roles:\n     - \"inf\" (shortstop or second baseman) for Pat Harrison.\n     - \"1b\" (first baseman) for William Ferguson and George Putz.\n\n3. **Check Order of Draft:**\n   - We need to verify the order of drafting to see if the last player drafted is a non-pitcher:\n     1. Round 1: Pat Harrison, Position: inf\n     2. Round 2: William Camp, Position: rhp\n     3. Round 3: George Pugh, Position: lhp\n     4. Round 4: William Ferguson, Position: 1b\n     5. Round 5: George Putz, Position: 1b\n\n4. **Determine the Last Player Drafted and Their Role:**\n   - The last player in the list is:\n     - Row 5: George Putz, Position: 1b (non-pitcher)\n\n5. **Verify Claim Against Analysis:**\n   - We have identified that George Putz, a non-pitcher, was indeed the last player drafted.\n   - Additionally, we verified that there are no other non-pitchers after him in the list.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states \"the only non-pitcher to be drafted is the last player.\" Based on our analysis, this statement holds true as George Putz (a non-pitcher) was indeed the final player listed and the only non-pitcher after all others have been checked.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify positions that are pitchers: 'rhp' and 'lhp'.\",\n    \"From the table, William Camp (Row 2) is a pitcher ('rhp') and George Pugh (Row 3) is a pitcher ('lhp').\",\n    \"Other players have non-pitching roles: Pat Harrison ('inf'), William Ferguson ('1b'), and George Putz ('1b').\",\n    \"List the order of draft to determine the last player.\",\n    \"The order shows that George Putz (Row 5) is the last player drafted, with a non-pitcher position ('1b').\",\n    \"Verify that there are no other non-pitchers after him in the list.\",\n    \"Conclude that the claim 'the only non-pitcher to be drafted is the last player' is true.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
