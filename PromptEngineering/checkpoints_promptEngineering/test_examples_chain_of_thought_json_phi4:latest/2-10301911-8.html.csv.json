    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the rider in third position have a time of 1:19.02.8\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Column Headers**: \n   - The columns in the table are: `place`, `rider`, `country`, `machine`, `speed`, `time`, and `points`.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Data for Third Position**:\n   - We need to find the data row where the rider is in third position.\n   - From the \"place\" column, the third position corresponds to a value of 3.\n\n3. **Extract Data for Third Place**:\n   - Locate the row with `place` equal to 3. This row contains:\n     - Rider: \"gunter bartusch\"\n     - Country: \"east germany\"\n     - Machine: \"mz\"\n     - Speed: \"85.93 mph\"\n     - Time: \"1:19.02.8\"\n     - Points: 10\n\n4. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the rider in third position has a time of \"1:19.02.8\".\n   - From step 3, we confirmed that the time for the rider in third place is indeed \"1:19.02.8\".\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the extracted data matches the claim, the statement is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cell for verifying this claim is found at row index 2 (considering zero-based indexing) under the columns `place` and `time`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the column headers to understand the structure of the table.
