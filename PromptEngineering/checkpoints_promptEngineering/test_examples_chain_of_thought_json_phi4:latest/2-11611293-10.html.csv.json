We should look for the row in the table where both the \"player\" column matches \"lj burger\" and the \"date\" column matches \"19 - 02 - 2003\".\n\n2. **Check Player Column**: Examine each row's \"player\" column to find a match with \"lj burger\".\n\n3. **Verify Date**: Once we locate the correct player, check if the corresponding date in that row is \"19 - 02 - 2003\".\n\n4. **Cross-Reference Data**: Ensure both conditions (correct player and date) are satisfied for the claim to be true.\n\nLet's go through the table data:\n\n- The first row has \"m kaif\" as the player on \"10 - 03 - 2003\", which does not match our criteria.\n- The second row has \"v sehwag\" on \"12 - 02 - 2003\", again not a match.\n- In the third row, we find \"lj burger\" listed as the player with the date \"19 - 02 - 2003\". This matches both conditions of our claim.\n\nSince both the player and the date in this row match the claim, the statement is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cell for verification:\n- Row index: 2 (third row, considering zero-based indexing)\n- Columns: \"player\" with value \"lj burger\", \"date\" with value \"19 - 02 - 2003\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim involves verifying if 'lj burger' was a player on '19 - 02 - 2003'.
