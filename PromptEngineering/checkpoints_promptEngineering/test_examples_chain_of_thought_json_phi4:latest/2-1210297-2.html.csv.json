    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the ships \"hunter\" and \"hyperion\" being laid down on different days is true, we need to follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - We need to look at the \"laid down\" column for both \"hunter\" and \"hyperion\".\n\n2. **Locate the Rows**:\n   - Find the row corresponding to each ship in the table.\n\n3. **Extract Laying Down Dates**:\n   - For \"hunter\", extract the date from its row under the \"laid down\" column.\n   - For \"hyperion\", do the same.\n\n4. **Compare Dates**:\n   - Compare the two dates extracted to see if they are different.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n1. **Locate \"hunter\"**:\n   - In the data, find the row where the ship is \"hunter\".\n   - This corresponds to row index 8 (0-based indexing).\n\n2. **Extract Date for \"hunter\"**:\n   - From the \"laid down\" column in row 8: \"27 March 1935\".\n\n3. **Locate \"hyperion\"**:\n   - In the data, find the row where the ship is \"hyperion\".\n   - This corresponds to row index 9 (0-based indexing).\n\n4. **Extract Date for \"hyperion\"**:\n   - From the \"laid down\" column in row 9: \"27 March 1935\".\n\n5. **Compare Dates**:\n   - Both dates are \"27 March 1935\", which means they were laid down on the same day.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim that \"both hunter and hyperion ship be laid down on different day\" is FALSE because both ships were laid down on the same date, \"27 March 1935\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Locate the row for 'hunter' in the data, which corresponds to row index 8.\",\n    \"Extract the 'laid down' date for 'hunter', which is '27 March 1935'.\",\n    \"Locate the row for 'hyperion' in the data, which corresponds to row index 9.\",\n    \"Extract the 'laid down' date for 'hyperion', which is '27 March 1935'.\",\n    \"Compare the dates: both are '27 March 1935'.\",\n    \"Since the dates are the same, the claim that they were laid down on different days is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"laid down\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"laid down\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
