    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify two key pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. Whether Lionel Messi was ranked 2nd during the 2011/12 season.\n2. Whether he scored 73 goals during that same season.\n\nLet's go through these steps using the data provided in the table:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n- **Step 1:** Identify all entries for Lionel Messi from the data.\n  \n  From the data, there are three entries for Lionel Messi:\n  - Row 0: Rank = 1, Season = \"2011 / 12\", Goals = 73\n  - Row 2: Rank = 2, Season = \"2012 / 13\", Goals = 60\n  - Row 6: Rank = 7, Season = \"2009 / 10\", Goals = 47\n\n- **Step 2:** Focus on the entry for the season \"2011/12\".\n  \n  In row 0, we find:\n  - Lionel Messi's rank is 1.\n  - The number of goals scored is 73.\n\n- **Step 3:** Check if both conditions of the claim are met for the 2011/12 season.\n  \n  - For the 2011/12 season, Lionel Messi's rank is 1 (not 2 as claimed).\n  - However, he did score 73 goals during that season.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that Lionel Messi was ranked 2 and scored 73 goals in the 2011/12 season. Based on our analysis:\n- The number of goals (73) matches the data.\n- However, his rank is 1, not 2 as claimed.\n\nThus, the statement is **FALSE** because one part of it does not match the data: Lionel Messi's rank was 1 during the 2011/12 season, not 2.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification are:\n- Row 0, \"rank\": Rank = 1\n- Row 0, \"season\": Season = \"2011 / 12\"\n- Row 0, \"goals\": Goals = 73\n\nHere is the final output in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified Lionel Messi's entries for different seasons. Focused on the 2011/12 season entry: Rank was 1 and goals scored were 73. The claim states rank as 2, which does not match.
