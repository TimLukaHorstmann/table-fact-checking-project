The total combined score (sum of both teams' goals) must be 3.\n2. The match result must be recorded as \"draw\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Matches with Total Score of 3:**\n   - Calculate the sum of scores for each match and identify those where the total equals 3.\n\n   ```\n   Match on 31 October 1993:\n     - Score: 1 - 1\n     - Total score = 1 + 1 = 2 (Not 3)\n\n   Match on 24 April 1996:\n     - Score: 0 - 3\n     - Total score = 0 + 3 = 3\n\n   Match on 29 November 1997:\n     - Score: 2 - 2\n     - Total score = 2 + 2 = 4 (Not 3)\n\n   Other matches have total scores different from 3.\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Result for Matches with Total Score of 3:**\n   - For each match identified in step 1, check if the result is \"draw\".\n\n   ```\n   Match on 24 April 1996:\n     - Result: loss (Not a draw)\n\n   No other matches have total scores of 3.\n   ```\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The only match with a combined score of 3 is the one on 24 April 1996, but its result was \"loss\", not \"draw\".\n- Therefore, no match in the table satisfies both conditions simultaneously.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe claim is FALSE because there are no matches where the total points scored is 3 and the result is a draw.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify matches with a combined score of 3.\",\n    \"Check if any of these matches have a 'draw' as the result.\",\n    \"Match on 24 April 1996 has a total score of 3 but resulted in a loss, not a draw.\",\n    \"No match satisfies both conditions.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

According to the table, the relevant entries are:\n   - 31 October 1993: Score 1-1, Result Draw\n   - 14 December 1997: Score 0-0, Result Draw\n   - 22 November 1997: Score 1-1, Result Draw\n   - 29 November 1997: Score 2-2, Result Draw\n\n4. **Check Scores for Zero Points**:\n   - A zero point score means the match ended with a score of 0-0.\n   - From the filtered list, only one match (14 December 1997) has a score of 0-0.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The claim requires three games to have a combined score of 0-0 and end in a draw.
