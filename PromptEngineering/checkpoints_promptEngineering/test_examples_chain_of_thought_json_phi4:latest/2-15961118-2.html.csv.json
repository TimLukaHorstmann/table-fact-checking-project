    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table data based on the conditions specified in the claim:\n\n1. **Identify all entries with machine type \"nsr250\":**\n   - We look for rows where the column \"machine\" contains \"nsr250\".\n\n2. **Check which teams have used \"nsr250\":**\n   - For each entry identified in step 1, note down the team name from the \"team\" column.\n\n3. **Determine if \"cup noodle - honda\" is the only team using \"nsr250\":**\n   - Compare all noted team names and see if \"cup noodle - honda\" is the sole entry.\n\n4. **Verify points for \"cup noodle - honda\" with \"nsr250\":**\n   - For entries where the machine is \"nsr250\" and the team is \"cup noodle - honda\", check the \"points\" column to ensure they have less than 8 points.\n\n5. **Compile relevant data:**\n   - Identify rows that match these criteria for further analysis.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify entries with machine type \"nsr250\":**\n   - Row 0: year 1993, team \"cup noodle - honda\", machine \"nsr250\".\n   - Row 1: year 1994, team \"cup noodle - honda\", machine \"nsr250\".\n\n2. **Check teams using \"nsr250\":**\n   - Both entries (row 0 and row 1) have the team \"cup noodle - honda\". No other teams are listed with this machine type.\n\n3. **Verify if \"cup noodle - honda\" is the only team:**\n   - Since both rows with \"nsr250\" have the same team, \"cup noodle - honda\" is indeed the only team using this machine.\n\n4. **Check points for \"cup noodle - honda\":**\n   - Row 0: Points are 8.\n   - Row 1: Points are 11.\n   - Both entries have 8 or more points, not less than 8.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim states that \"cup noodle - honda\" is the only team with \"nsr250\" and has less than 8 points. While it's true they are the only team using \"nsr250\", neither of their entries have less than 8 points. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify all rows where the machine is 'nsr250'. Both rows with this machine type have the team 'cup noodle - honda', confirming they are the only team using it. However, checking their points reveals that neither row has less than 8 points (one has 8 and the other has 11). Therefore, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\", \"value\": \"cup noodle - honda\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"machine\", \"value\": \"nsr250\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\", \"value\": 8},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\", \"value\": \"cup noodle - honda\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"machine\", \"value\": \"nsr250\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\", \"value\": 11}\n  ]\n}\n```",
