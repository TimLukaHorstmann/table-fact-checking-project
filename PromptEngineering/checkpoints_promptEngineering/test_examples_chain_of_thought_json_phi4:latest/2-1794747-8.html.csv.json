There is only one entry for the year 2012 in the provided data.\n\n### Step 4: Check for Imelda Staunton as a Nominee\n\nIn Row Index 0, we observe:\n- `nominee`: \"best musical\"\n\nImelda Staunton is not listed as the nominee here.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude Based on Data Examination\n\nSince there are no entries in the year 2012 where Imelda Staunton is mentioned as a nominee, we can conclude that the claim is false. \n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells for this analysis are from Row Index 0:\n- `year` (Row Index 0)\n- `nominee` (Row Index 0)\n\nHere's the final JSON output with our reasoning and conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, we identified the claim to be verified. Next, we examined the table structure focusing on 'year' and 'nominee'. We filtered the data for entries from 2012, found only one such entry where the nominee was 'best musical', not Imelda Staunton. Therefore, there are no instances of Imelda Staunton being a nominee in 2012.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to analyze the table for the specific details mentioned in the claim.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Columns**: \n   - The columns relevant to evaluating the claim are \"year\", \"award ceremony\", \"category\", \"nominee\", and \"result\".\n\n2. **Extract Information from the Table**:\n   - We need to check if there is a row where the \"year\" is 2013, the \"award ceremony\" is \"laurence olivier award\", the \"category\" is \"best actress in a musical\", the \"nominee\" is \"imelda staunton\", and the \"result\" is \"won\".\n\n3. **Locate the Relevant Rows**:\n   - Look through each row to find matches for these criteria.\n\n4. **Check Each Row**:\n   - The table has multiple rows, but we are interested in the ones related to the Laurence Olivier Award in 2013.\n   - Specifically, we need to focus on the rows that pertain to the \"laurence olivier award\".\n\n5. **Verify the Specific Claim**:\n   - In row 4 of the data array, we find:\n     - \"year\": 2013\n     - \"award ceremony\": \"laurence olivier award\"\n     - \"category\": \"best actress in a musical\"\n     - \"nominee\": \"imelda staunton\"\n     - \"result\": \"won\"\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The row matches all the criteria specified in the claim, confirming that Imelda Staunton did win the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical in 2013.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table contains multiple rows related to awards.
