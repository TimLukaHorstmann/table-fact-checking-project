    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, let's break down the claim step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the Runner-Up**: The claim states \"Rick Huiskamp be a runner-up\". We need to find instances in the data where Rick Huiskamp is listed as the runner-up.\n\n2. **Check Margin of Victory**: Once we identify when Rick Huiskamp was a runner-up, we need to check if the margin of victory for that event is a single-digit number (1-9 strokes).\n\n3. **Analyze the Data**:\n   - Look through each row in the data to find entries where Rick Huiskamp is listed as the \"runner-up\".\n   - For those entries, verify the \"margin of victory\".\n\n4. **Evaluate Each Relevant Entry**:\n   - **Row 3**: \n     - Date: 22 Jun 2006\n     - Tournament: Habsburg Classic\n     - Runner-Up: Rick Huiskamp\n     - Margin of Victory: 10 strokes\n\n5. **Determine the Truth of the Claim**:\n   - Rick Huiskamp is indeed a runner-up in one instance (Row 3).\n   - However, the margin of victory for that event is 10 strokes, which is not a single-digit number.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the margin of victory when Rick Huiskamp was a runner-up is not a single-digit number, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere is the final output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim involves two parts: identifying Rick Huiskamp as a runner-up and checking if the margin of victory is a single-digit number.
