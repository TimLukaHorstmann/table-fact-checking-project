We will follow a step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Entry:**\n   - The claim concerns the \"november 16\" game.\n   - Locate this date in the data array of the JSON object.\n\n2. **Extract Information:**\n   - Check the \"date\" column to find the entry with November 16.\n   - This is located at row index 7 (since indexing starts from 0).\n\n3. **Verify Score:**\n   - Once we have identified the correct row, examine the \"score\" column for this date.\n   - The score for the game on November 16 is recorded as \"l 123 - 126\".\n\n4. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the score was \"123 - 126\".\n   - The record in the table confirms this score exactly.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the score from the table matches the claim, the statement is true.\n\nNow, we will present our findings in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the game entry for November 16 within the data array of the table.
