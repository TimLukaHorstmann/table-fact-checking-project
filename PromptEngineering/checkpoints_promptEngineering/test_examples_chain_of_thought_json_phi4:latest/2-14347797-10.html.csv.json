    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the opponent for April 14 be the New Jersey Devil\" is true or false, we need to examine the data in the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Column**: \n   - The column that contains information about the opponents is named \"opponent\".\n\n2. **Locate the Date**:\n   - We are interested in the game that took place on \"April 14\". \n\n3. **Find the Row for April 14**:\n   - Review each row to find where the date matches \"April 14\".\n   - In the data array, the fourth entry (index 3) has the date \"april 14\".\n\n4. **Check the Opponent for April 14**:\n   - Look at the \"opponent\" column in the row corresponding to \"april 14\".\n   - The value in this cell is \"new jersey devils\".\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the opponent on April 14 is \"the New Jersey Devil\".\n   - The table indicates \"new jersey devils\", which matches the opponent's name, albeit with a slight difference in capitalization (\"Devils\" vs \"devil\").\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is essentially true because the opponent for April 14 is indeed the New Jersey Devils, and any minor discrepancy in capitalization does not change the factual accuracy of the statement.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the 'opponent' column. Locate the row with date 'april 14'. Check the opponent value for this date which is 'new jersey devils'. The claim states 'the New Jersey Devil', which matches the opponent name despite capitalization differences.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
