    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the average of all the home team scores be less than 12\" is true or false, we need to evaluate the home team scores provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Extract Home Team Scores:**\n   - The scores are given in a specific format (e.g., \"14.7 (91)\"). We need to extract just the numerical part before the first period, which represents the number of goals scored.\n   - Relevant scores from each row:\n     - Footscray: 14\n     - Fitzroy: 16\n     - Essendon: 13\n     - Carlton: 20\n     - Hawthorn: 19\n     - Collingwood: 10\n\n2. **Calculate the Average Home Team Score:**\n   - Sum the home team scores:\n     \\[\n     14 + 16 + 13 + 20 + 19 + 10 = 92\n     \\]\n   - Count the number of matches (rows) to find the average:\n     - There are 6 rows.\n   - Calculate the average:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average} = \\frac{92}{6} \\approx 15.33\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the average should be less than 12.\n   - Our calculated average is approximately 15.33, which is greater than 12.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since 15.33 is not less than 12, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- We considered all rows for the \"home team score\" column to calculate the average.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Extracted home team scores from each row: Footscray (14), Fitzroy (16), Essendon (13), Carlton (20), Hawthorn (19), Collingwood (10).\",\n    \"Summed the home team scores: 14 + 16 + 13 + 20 + 19 + 10 = 92.\",\n    \"Counted the number of matches: 6.\",\n    \"Calculated the average: 92 / 6 \u2248 15.33.\",\n    \"Compared the calculated average to the claim (less than 12).\",\n    \"Since 15.33 is greater than 12, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
