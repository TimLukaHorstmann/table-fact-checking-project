    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Tom Roche wasn't picked at all\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data provided.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure**: \n   - The table has columns: `round`, `pick`, `overall`, `name`, `position`, and `college`.\n   - Each row represents a player selected in the draft.\n\n2. **Locate Tom Roche**:\n   - We need to find if there is any entry for \"Tom Roche\" in the `name` column of the table.\n\n3. **Examine Relevant Data**:\n   - Scan through each row and check the `name` field.\n   - Identify the row where the `name` is \"Tom Roche\".\n\n4. **Verify Details for Tom Roche**:\n   - Once located, confirm the details in that row to ensure it matches the claim's context (i.e., if he was indeed picked).\n\n5. **Analyze Findings**:\n   - If a row exists with `name` as \"Tom Roche\", then he was picked.\n   - If no such row exists, then he wasn't picked.\n\n### Detailed Examination:\n\n- **Row 30**: \n  - `round`: 30\n  - `pick`: 1\n  - `overall`: 350\n  - `name`: \"tom roche\"\n  - `position`: \"tackle\"\n  - `college`: \"northwestern\"\n\nFrom the above steps, we find that Tom Roche is listed in row 30 with an overall pick number of 350. This confirms that he was indeed picked.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim \"Tom Roche wasn't picked at all\" is FALSE because there is a record showing that he was selected as the 350th overall pick.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists players selected in the draft by round, pick number, and overall selection order.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"joe sabol be draft first\" is true or false, let's analyze the provided table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim suggests that Joe Sabol was drafted as the very first pick in a draft round.\n\n2. **Identify Key Information**:\n   - We need to check Joe Sabol's position in terms of \"round\", \"pick\", and \"overall\" numbers.\n   - Specifically, we are looking for whether he is listed with `round = 1`, `pick = 1`, and `overall = 2` (since the first pick overall would be `overall = 1`).\n\n3. **Locate Joe Sabol in the Table**:\n   - Search through the \"name\" column to find an entry for \"joe sabol\".\n   - The relevant row is found at index 27.\n\n4. **Examine Joe Sabol's Draft Details**:\n   - From the table, Joe Sabol's details are: `round = 28`, `pick = 1`, and `overall = 326`.\n   - These values indicate that he was drafted in the 28th round as the first pick of that round, but not as the first overall pick.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since Joe Sabol's `overall` number is 326, he was not the first overall draft pick.\n   - Therefore, the claim \"joe sabol be draft first\" is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells for this analysis are those containing Joe Sabol's details: row index 27 with columns \"round\", \"pick\", and \"overall\".\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim suggests Joe Sabol was drafted as the first overall pick.\",\n    \"Check Joe Sabol's draft details by locating him in the table.\",\n    \"Joe Sabol is found at row index 27 with 'round' = 28, 'pick' = 1, and 'overall' = 326.\",\n    \"'Overall' = 326 means he was not the first overall pick.\",\n    \"Thus, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
