    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Tom Lehman spent more weeks at number 1 than any other US player\" is true or false, let's analyze the relevant data:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Tom Lehman's Data:**\n   - From the table, locate the entry for Tom Lehman.\n   - He is in row index 15 with \"weeks\" = 1.\n\n2. **Check Other US Players:**\n   - Identify all players from the United States and compare their weeks at number 1:\n     - Tiger Woods (Row 0): Weeks = 656\n     - Greg Norman (Row 1) is not from the US, so ignore.\n     - Fred Couples (Row 10): Weeks = 16\n     - David Duval (Row 11): Weeks = 15\n     - Tom Lehman (Row 15): Weeks = 1\n\n3. **Comparison:**\n   - Compare Tom Lehman's weeks (1) with the weeks of other US players:\n     - Tiger Woods has significantly more weeks at number 1 than Tom Lehman.\n     - Fred Couples and David Duval also have more weeks than Tom Lehman.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since other US players like Tiger Woods, Fred Couples, and David Duval each spent more weeks at number 1 compared to Tom Lehman, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Tom Lehman spent 1 week at number 1. Other US players such as Tiger Woods (656 weeks), Fred Couples (16 weeks), and David Duval (15 weeks) all have more weeks than Tom Lehman. Therefore, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"weeks\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"weeks\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"weeks\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"weeks\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
