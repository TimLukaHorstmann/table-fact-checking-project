    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, let's break down the claim into its components and verify each part against the data provided in the table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **The highest away score be 3 - 1 in the 2001 - 02 season.**\n2. **The lowest away score be 0 - 0 on two occasions, one in the 1995 - 96 season and one in the 2001 - 02 season.**\n\n### Verification Steps:\n\n#### Step 1: Verify the highest away score in the 2001 - 02 season.\n- Look at all entries from the \"data\" list where the \"season\" is \"2001 - 02\".\n- Relevant rows are:\n  - Row 1: `[\"2001 - 02\", \"uefa cup\", \"first round\", \"matador p\\u00fachov\", \"2 - 1\", \"0 - 0\"]`\n  - Row 2: `[\"2001 - 02\", \"uefa cup\", \"second round\", \"st gallen\", \"0 - 1\", \"4 - 1\"]`\n  - Row 3: `[\"2001 - 02\", \"uefa cup\", \"third round\", \"feyenoord\", \"2 - 2\", \"0 - 1\"]`\n\n- The highest away score is found in the second row, where the \"away\" column shows \"4 - 1\". Therefore, the claim that the highest away score is \"3 - 1\" is FALSE.\n\n#### Step 2: Verify the lowest away score of 0 - 0 on two occasions.\n- **1995 - 96 Season:**\n  - Look at all entries where the \"season\" is \"1995 - 96\".\n  - Relevant row:\n    - Row 0: `[\"1995 - 96\", \"uefa cup\", \"first round\", \"slavia prague\", \"1 - 2\", \"0 - 0\"]`\n  - The away score here is \"0 - 0\". This matches the claim for one occasion in the 1995 - 96 season.\n\n- **2001 - 02 Season:**\n  - Look at all entries where the \"season\" is \"2001 - 02\".\n  - Relevant rows are:\n    - Row 1: `[\"2001 - 02\", \"uefa cup\", \"first round\", \"matador p\\u00fachov\", \"2 - 1\", \"0 - 0\"]`\n    - Row 3: `[\"2001 - 02\", \"uefa cup\", \"third round\", \"feyenoord\", \"2 - 2\", \"0 - 1\"]`\n\n- The away score of \"0 - 0\" appears in row 1. This matches the claim for one occasion in the 2001 - 02 season.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The first part of the claim about the highest away score being \"3 - 1\" is false because it was actually \"4 - 1\".\n- The second part of the claim about the lowest away score of \"0 - 0\" on two occasions (one in each specified season) is true.\n\nSince one part of the claim is false, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 2, Column \"away\": Contains \"4 - 1\", verifying the highest away score.\n- Row 0, Column \"away\": Contains \"0 - 0\" for the 1995 - 96 season.\n- Row 1, Column \"away\": Contains \"0 - 0\" for the 2001 - 02 season.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The highest away score in the 2001 - 02 season was 4 - 1, not 3 - 1.
