These do not match \"no ( fta )\".\n     - The entries for \"cartello promozionale sky hd\" have \"package / option\" as \"qualsiasi tranne sky hd\", which also does not directly mention \"no ( fta )\" but implies exclusion of Sky HD, not a direct equivalence to \"no ( fta )\".\n\n5. **Look for Direct Matches**:\n   - No row explicitly lists \"no ( fta )\" in the \"package / option\" column.\n\n6. **Verify 'Cartello Promozionale Sky HD' Status**:\n   - The entries for \"cartello promozionale sky hd\" do not have \"no ( fta )\" but rather a different specification (\"qualsiasi tranne sky hd\"). Therefore, it does not fulfill the condition of having \"no ( fta )\".\n\n7. **Conclusion on Uniqueness**:\n   - Since no service is explicitly marked with \"no ( fta )\" as its package/option in any row and \"cartello promozionale sky hd\" is not such a case either, it cannot be considered the only one with that feature.\n\n8. **Final Assessment**:\n   - The statement claims exclusivity for \"cartello promozionale sky hd\", but since no service has \"no ( fta )\" as an option at all, the claim is technically false because there is no such exclusive case to begin with.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify entries where 'package / option' is 'no ( fta )'.\",\n    \"No entries explicitly list 'no ( fta )' in the 'package / option' column.\",\n    \"'Cartello promozionale sky hd' does not have 'no ( fta )'; it has a different package specification.\",\n    \"Since no service matches 'no ( fta )', the claim about exclusivity is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"package / option\" }\n  ]\n}\n``` \n\nThe relevant cells section lists only the column involved since no specific row entries matched the criteria.",
