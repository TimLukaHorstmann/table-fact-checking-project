Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Row for Japan**: Locate Japan's row to check their total medal count and silver medals.\n   - According to the data, Japan is ranked 2nd with:\n     - Gold: 4\n     - Silver: 1\n     - Bronze: 0\n     - Total Medals: 5\n\n2. **Verify Medal Count Without Silver**: The claim states that Japan has the most medals without a single silver. However, Japan has 1 silver medal.\n\n3. **Look for Nations with More Medals and No Silver**:\n   - We need to identify any nation with more than 5 total medals and no silver medals.\n   - Check each row where \"silver\" is 0 and see if the total is greater than 5.\n   \n4. **Examine Other Relevant Rows**:\n   - Russia (rank 1): Gold: 7, Silver: 1, Bronze: 5, Total: 13\n     - Has silver medals; thus not relevant.\n   - Bulgaria (rank 3) and Georgia (rank 4): Both have 4 total medals with at least one of each type.\n   - Cuba (rank 5), Iran (rank 6), France (rank 7), China (rank 8): All have silver medals.\n   - Azerbaijan, Turkey: Total less than or equal to 2.\n   - United States (rank 11): Gold: 0, Silver: 2, Bronze: 5, Total: 7\n     - Has silver; thus not relevant.\n   - Ukraine (rank 12), Kazakhstan (rank 13), Canada, Lithuania, Mongolia, South Korea (all rank 14): All have at least one silver medal or less than 5 total medals.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: No country listed in the table has more than 5 medals and zero silver medals.
