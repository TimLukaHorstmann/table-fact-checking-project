    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify if the method \"tko (cut)\" occurred in round 1 of the event \"ufc 20\". Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify relevant columns**: We are interested in the columns \"event\", \"round\", and \"method\" since they will help us verify the claim.\n\n2. **Search for the specific event**: Look through the data to find entries where the \"event\" column matches \"ufc 20\".\n\n3. **Check the round number**: For the entry or entries found in step 2, ensure that the \"round\" is 1.\n\n4. **Verify the method**: Confirm that the \"method\" for these entries is \"tko (cut)\".\n\n5. **Conclude based on findings**: If an entry matches all three criteria (event = \"ufc 20\", round = 1, method = \"tko (cut)\"), then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the data:\n\n- **Step 2**: Locate entries with \"event\" as \"ufc 20\". We find one such entry:\n  - Row index: 11\n  - Columns of interest:\n    - event: \"ufc 20\"\n    - round: 1\n    - method: \"tko (cut)\"\n\n- **Step 3**: Check the \"round\" for this entry.
