However, the absence of data in this specific table does not necessarily mean her career ended in 2003; it simply reflects that she did not participate in the matches listed here.\n- Without additional context or data beyond this table, we cannot definitively conclude that her career ended in 2003 based solely on this dataset.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table does not list any matches involving Magdalena Maleeva.
