Her initial status as heir presumptive is linked to her brother's death, not her birth.\n\n3. **Conclusion from Analysis:**\n   - The only individual whose reason for becoming an heir is explicitly due to their own birth is William Adelin (\"born\" on row 6).\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   - Since no other individuals in the table became heirs specifically because of their birth, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"We examine the 'reason' column for each entry to see if any heir became so due to their own birth.\",\n    \"Robert Curthose's reasons (rows 1 and 3) are tied to his father's kingship and an agreement, not birth.\",\n    \"Henry Beauclerc's reason (row 4) is linked to a rebellion, not birth.\",\n    \"Succession periods in rows 2 and 5 are unclear.\",\n    \"William Adelin's reason in row 6 is explicitly 'born,' indicating inheritance by birth.\",\n    \"Empress Matilda's reason (row 7) is due to her brother's death, not her own birth.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"reason\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"reason\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Robert Curthose being heir twice, specifically in 1082 and 1094, is true or false, we need to examine the table data for entries related to Robert Curthose's status as an heir.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - Look for entries where \"heir\" is \"robert curthose.\"\n\n2. **Examine Each Entry:**\n   - The first entry:\n     - Heir: \"robert curthose\"\n     - Status: \"heir presumptive\"\n     - Became heir in 1066\n     - Ceased to be heir in 1077\n     - Monarch: \"william i\"\n   - This indicates Robert Curthose was heir from 1066 to 1077.\n\n3. **Check the Second Entry for Robert Curthose:**\n   - The third entry:\n     - Heir: \"robert curthese\"\n     - Status: \"heir presumptive\"\n     - Became heir in 1087\n     - Ceased to be heir in 1088\n     - Monarch: \"william ii\"\n   - This indicates Robert Curthose was heir from 1087 to 1088.\n\n4. **Check for Specific Years Mentioned in the Claim (1082 and 1094):**\n   - The years 1082 and 1094 are mentioned in the claim.\n   - In both identified periods of being an heir (1066-1077 and 1087-1088), neither 1082 nor 1094 falls within these ranges.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Robert Curthose was not heir in either 1082 or 1094 based on the table data.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows that Robert Curthose was heir from 1066 to 1077 and again from 1087 to 1088. The years 1082 and 1094 do not fall within these periods, so he was not heir in those specific years.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"ceased to be heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"ceased to be heir\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
