For V Zapata:\n   - Row with `name`: \"v zapata\"\n   - `moving to`: \"alianza atl\u00e9tico\"\n\n2.

We need to verify that both transfers occurred in the winter window.\n\n- **V Zapata**:\n  - `transfer window`: \"winter\"\n\n- **Curiel**:\n  - `transfer window`: \"winter\"\n\nBoth transfers are listed under the \"winter\" window, which aligns with the claim of happening in 2008.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nSince both V Zapata and Curiel are moving to \"alianza atl\u00e9tico\" during the winter transfer window, the conditions of the claim are satisfied. However, the table does not explicitly state the year as 2008; it only specifies the transfer window. Without additional context or explicit mention of the year in the data, we cannot definitively confirm the year as 2020.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe claim is based on the assumption that \"winter\" refers to the winter of 2008, but the table does not provide this specific year information.
