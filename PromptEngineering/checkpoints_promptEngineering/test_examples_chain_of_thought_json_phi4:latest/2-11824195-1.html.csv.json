    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the game against the Miami Dolphins having an attendance of 34,063 is true or false, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: We need to find all entries related to games played against the \"miami dolphins\" in the dataset.\n\n2. **Check the Attendance for Each Match**:\n   - Review each entry with \"opponent\" as \"miami dolphins\".\n   - Check the \"attendance\" value for these matches.\n\n3. **Compare Against Claim**: Verify if any of the identified games has an attendance of 34,063.\n\nLet's go through the data step-by-step:\n\n- **Row 1 to Row 4**: No mention of \"miami dolphins\".\n- **Row 5**: Opponent is \"denver broncos\", not relevant.\n- **Row 6**: Opponent is \"oakland raiders\", not relevant.\n- **Row 7**: Opponent is \"denver broncos\", not relevant.\n- **Row 8**: Opponent is \"houston oilers\", not relevant.\n- **Row 9**: Opponent is \"san diego chargers\", not relevant.\n- **Row 10**: Opponent is \"miami dolphins\". Attendance for this game is 34,063. This matches the claim.\n- **Row 11 to Row 13**: No mention of \"miami dolphins\".\n- **Row 14**: Opponent is again \"miami dolphins\". Attendance for this game is 17,881, which does not match the claim.\n- **Row 15**: Opponent is \"san diego chargers\", not relevant.\n\n**Conclusion**: There are two games against the Miami Dolphins in the dataset. One of them (on November 13, 1966) had an attendance of 34,063, which matches the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We identified the entries related to 'miami dolphins' and checked their attendance values.
