According to this list, \"3 - dart average\" is the last column.\n\n4. **Verify the Value:**\n   - Check the value in Steve Beaton's row for the \"3 - dart average\" column.\n   - Compare this value with the claim (92.58).\n\n5. **Determine Truthfulness:**\n   - If the value matches 92.58, then the claim is true.\n   - If it does not match, then the claim is false.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- From the table:\n  - Steve Beaton's row is found at index 18 (0-based indexing).\n  - In this row, the \"3 - dart average\" value is indeed 92.58.\n\nThus, based on the data provided in the table, the claim that \"Steve Beaton have a 3 - dart average of 92.58\" is true.\n\n### Final Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate Steve Beaton's row by matching player names in the 'data' array.
