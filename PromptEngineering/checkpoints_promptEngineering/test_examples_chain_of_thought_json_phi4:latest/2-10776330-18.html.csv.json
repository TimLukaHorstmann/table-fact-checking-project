    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the Victorian Football League (VFL) season being its 65th season is true or false, we need to analyze the provided data and apply some external knowledge about VFL history.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Table:**\n   - The table contains match details from the VFL on \"26 August 1961.\"\n   - It lists home and away teams, scores, venue, crowd size, and date for several matches.\n\n2. **Identifying the Year:**\n   - All matches are dated \"26 August 1961,\" indicating these games occurred in the 1961 season of the VFL.\n\n3. **Historical Context of the VFL:**\n   - The Victorian Football League (VFL) was established in 1897.\n   - To determine if the 1961 season is the 65th, we calculate the number of seasons from its inception to 1961.\n\n4. **Calculating the Number of Seasons:**\n   - From 1897 to 1961 is a span of 64 years.\n   - The first season would be in 1897, making it the 1st season.\n   - Therefore, 1961 would be the 65th season (since 1961 - 1897 + 1 = 65).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the calculation, the claim that the 1961 VFL season is the 65th season is accurate.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table indicates matches from the VFL on 26 August 1961.
