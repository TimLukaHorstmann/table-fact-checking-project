    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the latest stage win by Mikhail Ignatiev was Stage 6\" is true or false, we need to analyze the data provided in the table:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understand the Structure**: \n   - The table has columns: `stage`, `winner`, `general classification`, `points classification`, `mountains classification`, `young riders classification`, and `team classification`.\n   - Each row corresponds to a stage of a cycling event, with relevant data for each category.\n\n2. **Identify the Column of Interest**:\n   - The claim pertains to the \"winner\" column, which lists the winner of each stage.\n\n3. **Locate Mikhail Ignatiev's Name**:\n   - We need to find all occurrences of \"mikhail ignatiev\" in the `winner` column to see in which stages he won.\n\n4. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: Winner is \"linus gerdemann\".\n   - **Row 2**: Winner is \"tom boonen\".\n   - **Row 3**: Winner is \"daniele bennati\".\n   - **Row 4**: Winner is \"michele scarponi\".\n   - **Row 5**: Winner is \"enrico gasparotto\".\n   - **Row 6**: Winner is \"mikhail ignatiev\". This confirms he won Stage 6.\n   - **Row 7**: Winner is \"edvald boasson hagen\".\n\n5. **Determine the Latest Stage**:\n   - The table lists stages sequentially from 1 to 7.\n   - Mikhail Ignatiev appears only in Row 6 as a winner, which corresponds to Stage 6.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since Mikhail Ignatiev's name is found only once in the `winner` column at Row 6, his latest and only stage win is indeed Stage 6.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists stages sequentially from 1 to 7. The 'winner' column shows Mikhail Ignatiev won at Row 6, corresponding to Stage 6. Since he does not appear as a winner in any other row, Stage 6 is his latest and only stage win.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"winner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
