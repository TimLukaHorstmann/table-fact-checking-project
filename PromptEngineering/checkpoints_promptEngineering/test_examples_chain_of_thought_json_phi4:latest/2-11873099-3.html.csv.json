    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Maxi be the only player on the list from Eurasia\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to evaluate which players are from Eurasian countries. The term \"Eurasia\" typically includes Europe and Asia.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Maxi's Country:**\n   - Locate Maxi in the table. From the data:\n     - `Maxi` is listed as coming from `\"arg\"` which stands for Argentina.\n   - Determine if Argentina is part of Eurasia. Argentina is located in South America, not Eurasia.\n\n2. **Review All Players to Identify Any from Eurasian Countries:**\n   - Go through each entry in the table and check the `country` column:\n     1. `\"van bommel\"` from `\"ned\"` (Netherlands) \u2013 Europe.\n     2. `\"larsson\"` from `\"swe\"` (Sweden) \u2013 Europe.\n     3. `\"maxi\"` from `\"arg\"` (Argentina) \u2013 South America.\n     4. `\"damia\"` from `\"esp\"` (Spain) \u2013 Europe.\n     5. `\"f navarro\"` from `\"esp\"` (Spain) \u2013 Europe.\n     6. `\"oscar lopez\"` from `\"esp\"` (Spain) \u2013 Europe.\n     7. `\"gabri\"` from `\"esp\"` (Spain) \u2013 Europe.\n     8. `\"r\\u00fcst\\u00fc\"` from `\"tur\"` (Turkey) \u2013 Asia and partly in Eastern Europe.\n     9. `\"rodri\"` from `\"esp\"` (Spain) \u2013 Europe.\n\n3. **Identify Players from Eurasian Countries:**\n   - From the list above, players from European countries are:\n     - `van bommel` (Netherlands), `larsson` (Sweden), `damia`, `f navarro`, `oscar lopez`, `gabri`, and `rodri` (all Spain).\n   - Players from Asian country are:\n     - `r\u00fcst\u00fc` (Turkey).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Maxi is not from a Eurasian country.\n   - There are multiple players from European countries, and one player (`R\u00fcst\u00fc`) from an Asian country.\n\nSince there are several players from Europe and one from Asia in addition to Maxi, the claim that \"Maxi be the only player on the list from Eurasia\" is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Maxi's entry: `{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\", \"value\": \"arg\"}`\n- All other players' countries are relevant for verifying their origin as part of Europe or Asia.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify Maxi's country: Argentina, which is not in Eurasia.\",\n    \"Review all player entries and identify those from European and Asian countries.\",\n    \"Listed players from European countries include: Netherlands, Sweden, Spain (multiple), Turkey.\",\n    \"Conclude that there are multiple players from Europe and one from Asia besides Maxi.\",\n    \"Determine the claim is FALSE as Maxi is not the only player from Eurasia.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\", \"value\": \"arg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\", \"value\": \"ned\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\", \"value\": \"swe\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\", \"value\": \"esp\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\", \"value\": \"esp\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\", \"value\": \"esp\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"country\", \"value\": \"esp\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"country\", \"value\": \"tur\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"country\", \"value\": \"esp\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
