    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"in stanley the bridge be of the concrete deck girder style\" is true or false, let's follow a logical reasoning process using the given table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - We need to identify rows where the `location` column matches \"stanley\".\n\n2. **Examine Each Identified Row for Type:**\n   - Check the `type` column of each row with location \"stanley\" to see if it mentions \"concrete deck girder bridge\".\n\n3. **Verification Against Claim:**\n   - The claim specifies a bridge in \"stanley\" should be of the \"concrete deck girder style\". We need to verify that there is indeed such a bridge.\n\n### Execution\n\n- **Scan through Rows:**\n  - Iterate over each row and check if `location` is \"stanley\".\n\n- **Identify Matches:**\n  - Find the row(s) where `location` is \"stanley\" and record the associated `type`.\n\n- **Check Type for Concrete Deck Girder Bridge:**\n  - For rows with `location` as \"stanley\", verify if `type` is \"concrete deck girder bridge\".\n\n### Analysis of Data\n\n- Upon scanning through the data, we find:\n  - Row index 10 corresponds to a location \"stanley\".\n  - The `type` for this row is \"concrete deck girder bridge\".\n\nThis matches the claim that in Stanley, there is a bridge of the \"concrete deck girder\" style.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The claim is supported by the data.
