    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Argentinos Juniors and Racing Club both not qualifying for Supercopa 1994 is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant columns**: The columns we are interested in are \"team\" and \"supercopa 1994.\"\n\n2. **Locate the row for Argentinos Juniors**:\n   - Search through the data for the team name \"argentinos juniors.\"\n   - Check the corresponding cell under the column \"supercopa 1994\" to see their performance.\n\n3. **Locate the row for Racing Club**:\n   - Similarly, search through the data for the team name \"racing club.\"\n   - Check the corresponding cell under the column \"supercopa 1994\" to verify their performance.\n\n4. **Compare with the claim**: The claim states that both Argentinos Juniors and Racing Club did not qualify for Supercopa 1994. We need to check if the entries in these cells match this statement.\n\n5. **Verify each team's entry**:\n   - For Argentinos Juniors, find their row (index 8) and look at the \"supercopa 1994\" column.\n     - Entry: \"1st round\"\n   - For Racing Club, find their row (index 9) and check the same column.\n     - Entry: \"1st round\"\n\n6. **Interpret the data**:\n   - Both teams having an entry of \"1st round\" implies they participated in Supercopa 1994 but did not progress beyond this stage. This means they effectively did not qualify for further stages, aligning with the claim's implication.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Since both Argentinos Juniors and Racing Club have entries indicating participation only up to the first round, it can be concluded that they did not qualify past this point, which matches the claim.\n\nHere is the structured reasoning in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant columns: 'team' and 'supercopa 1994'.\",\n    \"Locate Argentinos Juniors in the data.
