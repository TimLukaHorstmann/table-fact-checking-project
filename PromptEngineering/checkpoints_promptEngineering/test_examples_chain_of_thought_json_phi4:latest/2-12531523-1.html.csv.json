    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the scores of Vijay Singh and Sandy Lyle from the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We need to find the total score for both Vijay Singh and Sandy Lyle.\n   \n2. **Extract Scores:**\n   - Locate Vijay Singh's data in the table:\n     - Vijay Singh has a total score of 289 (from the row where \"player\" is \"vijay singh\").\n   - Locate Sandy Lyle's data in the table:\n     - Sandy Lyle has a total score of 302 (from the row where \"player\" is \"sandy lyle\").\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - Compute the difference between Sandy Lyle's and Vijay Singh's scores.\n   - Difference = Sandy Lyle's Score - Vijay Singh's Score = 302 - 289 = 13.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Vijay Singh's score is less than 10 under Sandy Lyle's score.\n   - \"Less than 10 under\" means the difference should be greater than or equal to 10 (i.e., Sandy Lyle's score minus Vijay Singh's score should be at least 10).\n   - The calculated difference is 13, which is indeed greater than 10.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the difference of 13 meets the condition of being \"less than 10 under\" (i.e., at least a 10-point difference), the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Vijay Singh's total score: Row index 2, Column name \"total\".\n- Sandy Lyle's total score: Row index 5, Column name \"total\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified relevant scores for Vijay Singh and Sandy Lyle from the table.
