From the table data:\n   - Steven Johnson (Row 8)\n   - Will Davison (Row 22)\n\n2. **Check lap count for Jim Beam Racing drivers:**\n   - For Steven Johnson, he completed 78 laps and has a time of \"+ 7.7s\", indicating no additional laps behind the winner.\n   - For Will Davison, he completed only 5 laps and is noted as having \"mechanical\" issues.\n\n3. **Determine if any driver from Jim Beam Racing completed exactly 5 fewer laps than the winner:**\n   - The winner, Jamie Whincup (Row 0), completed 78 laps.\n   - Calculate laps behind for each Jim Beam Racing driver:\n     - Steven Johnson: 78 laps - Winner's 78 laps = 0 laps behind\n     - Will Davison: 5 laps - Winner's 78 laps = 73 laps behind\n\n4. **Conclusion based on the lap difference:**\n   - Neither Steven Johnson nor Will Davison completed exactly 5 fewer laps than the winner.\n   - Therefore, there is no instance where a Jim Beam Racing driver was 5 laps behind.\n\n**Final Answer in JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The relevant entries for Jim Beam Racing are Steven Johnson and Will Davison.
