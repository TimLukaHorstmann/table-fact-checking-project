    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to analyze the data provided for the engine used in 1972.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant row:**\n   - We are interested in the year \"1972\". According to the data, there is an entry for the year 1972 with the following details:\n     - Generation: \"i\"\n     - Year: \"1972\"\n     - Engine: \"455in cubic oldsmobile v8\"\n     - Power: \"-\"\n     - Torque: \"n/a\"\n     - Induction: \"4bbl carburetor\"\n\n2. **Check the power column for 1972 entry:**\n   - The claim states that the power of the 1972 engine is not given in horsepower (hp) or kilowatts (kw). \n   - In the table, under the \"power\" column for the year 1972, the value is \"-\". This indicates that no specific numerical value for power is provided.\n\n3. **Interpretation:**\n   - The \"-\" symbol suggests a lack of data entry for the power measurement in either hp or kw.\n   - Therefore, it aligns with the claim that the power of the 1972 engine is not given.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the table, the power information for the year 1972 is indeed missing (represented by \"-\"), supporting the statement that the power is not provided in hp or kw.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The entry for the year 1972 shows a '-' under the 'power' column, indicating no data is given for the engine's power. This supports the claim that the power of the 1972 engine is not provided in hp or kw.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"power\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
