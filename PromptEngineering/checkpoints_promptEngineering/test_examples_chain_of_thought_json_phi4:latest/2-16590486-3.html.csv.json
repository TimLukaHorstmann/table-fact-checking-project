However, both Switzerland and Argentina each won at least one medal (silver for Switzerland and bronze for Argentina).\n   - Thus, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n- For Switzerland:\n  - Row index 6, `gold`: 0\n  - Row index 6, `silver`: 1\n  - Row index 6, `bronze`: 0\n  \n- For Argentina:\n  - Row index 8, `gold`: 0\n  - Row index 8, `silver`: 0\n  - Row index 8, `bronze`: 1\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Switzerland and Argentina did not win any medals. Checking the table, Switzerland won 1 silver medal, and Argentina won 1 bronze medal. Therefore, both countries won at least one medal, making the claim FALSE.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
