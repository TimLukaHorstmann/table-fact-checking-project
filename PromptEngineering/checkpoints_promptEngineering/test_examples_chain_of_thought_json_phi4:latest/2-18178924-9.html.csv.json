    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze the provided table data step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim:**\n   - The claim states: \"wales be the opposing team with the against of 9.\"\n   - This means we are looking for an entry where the \"opposing teams\" column has the value \"wales\" and the \"against\" column has the value 9.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Table Structure:**\n   - The table is structured with columns: \"opposing teams,\" \"against,\" \"date,\" \"venue,\" and \"status.\"\n   - Each row represents a game or match with these attributes.\n\n3. **Inspecting Relevant Columns:**\n   - We need to focus on the \"opposing teams\" and \"against\" columns to verify the claim.\n\n4. **Checking Each Row:**\n   - **Row 1:** \n     - Opposing Teams: france\n     - Against: 15\n     - This does not match \"wales\" or 9.\n   \n   - **Row 2:** \n     - Opposing Teams: wales\n     - Against: 9\n     - This matches both the opposing team \"wales\" and the score against value of 9.\n\n   - **Row 3:** \n     - Opposing Teams: scotland\n     - Against: 0\n     - This does not match \"wales\" or 9.\n   \n   - **Row 4:** \n     - Opposing Teams: ireland\n     - Against: 9\n     - Although the \"against\" value matches, the opposing team is \"ireland,\" not \"wales.\"\n\n   - **Row 5:** \n     - Opposing Teams: new zealand\n     - Against: 16\n     - This does not match \"wales\" or 9.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is true because there is a row (Row 2) where the opposing team is \"wales\" and the score against is 9.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - Row 2, Column \"opposing teams\": \"wales\"\n   - Row 2, Column \"against\": 9\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that 'wales' should be the opposing team with an against score of 9.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"twickerham , london have less than 16 against\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table data related to matches played at Twickenham Stadium in London, specifically looking at the \"against\" column.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Matches Played at Twickenham:**\n   - We need to filter the entries where the venue is \"twickenham , london\".\n   \n2. **Extract Relevant Data:**\n   - From the table:\n     - The second row has a venue of \"twickenham , london\" with 9 points against Wales on 04 / 02 / 1978.\n     - The fourth row also lists \"twickenham , london\" as the venue with 9 points against Ireland on 18 / 03 / 1978.\n     - The fifth row has a match at \"twickenham , london\" with 16 points against New Zealand on 25 / 11 / 1978.\n\n3. **Evaluate Each Match:**\n   - For each of these matches, check the value in the \"against\" column:\n     - Against Wales: 9 points\n     - Against Ireland: 9 points\n     - Against New Zealand: 16 points\n\n4. **Determine Maximum Points Against:**\n   - The maximum number of points scored against in any match at Twickenham is 16 (against New Zealand).\n\n5. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"twickerham , london have less than 16 against\". \n   - Since one of the matches has exactly 16 points against, it does not satisfy the condition of being \"less than 16\".\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified matches played at Twickenham Stadium with venues 'twickenham , london'.
