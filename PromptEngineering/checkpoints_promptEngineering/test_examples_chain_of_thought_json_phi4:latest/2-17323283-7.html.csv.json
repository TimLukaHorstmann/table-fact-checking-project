    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the opponent for game 75 be the minnesota north star\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant part of the table.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The table consists of columns labeled as \"game\", \"march\", \"opponent\", \"score\", and \"record\". Each row corresponds to a game with these attributes.\n\n2. **Locate Game 75**: We need to find the data for game number 75 in the \"data\" section of the table. This requires searching through the list of lists until we identify the one that starts with 75.\n\n3. **Examine the Row for Game 75**:\n   - The row corresponding to game 75 is: `[75, 26, \"minnesota north stars\", \"5 - 0\", \"48 - 15 - 12\"]`.\n   - In this row, the \"opponent\" column contains the value `\"minnesota north stars\"`.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim**: The claim states that the opponent for game 75 is \"the minnesota north star\". Comparing this with the table:\n   - The opponent listed in the table is \"minnesota north stars\".\n   - The claim uses a singular form (\"north star\") whereas the table lists it in plural form (\"north stars\").\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Although there is a minor difference in wording (singular vs. plural), the intent and identity of the team are clear and match.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the above analysis, the opponent for game 75 is indeed \"minnesota north stars\", which aligns with the claim when considering context.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate game 75 in the data list.
