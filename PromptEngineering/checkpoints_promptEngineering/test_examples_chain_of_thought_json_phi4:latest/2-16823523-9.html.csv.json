    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's analyze the data step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that the first game occurred on December 9th, 2006.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**: We need to check the \"kick off\" column for all entries in the table to find the earliest date.\n\n3. **Extract Dates from the Table**:\n   - First entry: September 12, 2006\n   - Second entry: September 27, 2006\n   - Third entry: October 18, 2006\n   - Fourth entry: October 31, 2006\n   - Fifth entry: November 22, 2006\n   - Sixth entry: December 5, 2006\n\n4. **Compare Dates**: The earliest date in the \"kick off\" column is September 12, 2006.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**: Since the first game occurred on September 12, 2006, and not December 9th, 2006, the claim is false.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cell for determining the first game date is the \"kick off\" column of the first row (September 12, 2006).\n   - Additionally, the \"kick off\" column of the last row (December 5, 2006) can be noted as it is close to the claimed date but still later.\n\nBased on this reasoning:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim states that the first game occurred on December 9th, 2006.\",\n    \"We need to find the earliest date in the 'kick off' column of the table.\",\n    \"Extracted dates from the 'kick off' column are: September 12, 27; October 18, 31; November 22; December 5.\",\n    \"The earliest date is September 12, 2006.\",\n    \"Therefore, the claim that the first game occurred on December 9th, 2006, is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"kick off\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"kick off\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
