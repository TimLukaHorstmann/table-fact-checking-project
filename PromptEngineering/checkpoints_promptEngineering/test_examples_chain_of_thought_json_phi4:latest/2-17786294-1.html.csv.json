    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"as monaco scored the most goals in the round of 16 in the 1983 - 84 Coupe de France\" is true or false, we need to analyze the provided table data for the total number of goals scored by each team in that specific round.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Round of 16 Data:**\n   The table provides match results between teams in what appears to be a knockout tournament. We assume this is the \"round of 16\" data based on context given in the claim.\n\n2. **Understand the Table Structure:**\n   - Each row represents one match.\n   - Columns include:\n     - `team 1` and `team 2`: Names of the teams playing each other.\n     - `score`: Aggregate score from both rounds.\n     - `1st round` and `2nd round`: Scores from individual matches.\n\n3. **Determine Total Goals Scored by Each Team:**\n   For each row, calculate the total number of goals scored by both teams in that match (sum of 1st and 2nd round scores).\n\n4. **Calculate AS Monaco's Goals:**\n   - Locate \"as monaco\" in the `team 1` column.\n   - The row is:\n     ```\n     [\n       \"as monaco (d1)\",\n       \"6 - 1\",\n       \"as nancy (d1)\",\n       \"2 - 0\",\n       \"4 - 1\"\n     ]\n     ```\n   - AS Monaco's total goals = 2 (1st round) + 4 (2nd round) = 6.\n\n5. **Calculate Goals for Other Teams:**\n   - For each match, calculate both teams' scores:\n     - RC Lens vs. RC Strasbourg: \n       - RC Lens: 1 + 0 = 1\n       - RC Strasbourg: 0 + 0 = 0\n     - FC Rouen vs. Stade Lavallois: \n       - FC Rouen: 1 + 1 = 2\n       - Stade Lavallois: 0 + 3 = 3\n     - Girondins de Bordeaux vs. FC Mulhouse:\n       - Girondins de Bordeaux: 0 + 2 = 2\n       - FC Mulhouse: 1 + 2 = 3\n     - FC Nantes vs. Olympique Lyonnais:\n       - FC Nantes: 0 + 4 = 4\n       - Olympique Lyonnais: 0 + 4 = 4\n     - AS Cannes vs. FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard:\n       - AS Cannes: 3 + 1 = 4\n       - FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard: 0 + 1 = 1\n     - Sporting Toulon Var vs. En Avant Guingamp:\n       - Sporting Toulon Var: 2 + 0 = 2\n       - En Avant Guingamp: 0 + 1 = 1\n     - FC Metz vs. Besan\u00e7on RC:\n       - FC Metz: 4 + 1 = 5\n       - Besan\u00e7on RC: 0 + 1 = 1\n\n6. **Identify the Team with Most Goals:**\n   Compare all calculated total goals for each team in the round:\n   - AS Monaco: 6 goals\n   - FC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnais: 4 goals each\n   - FC Metz: 5 goals\n   - All others scored fewer than 5 goals.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   As Monaco did score the most goals (6) in this round compared to any other team.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify if AS Monaco scored the most goals, calculate total goals for each match from both rounds.

Therefore, there is no match involving RC Lens and Olympique Lyonnais in this data.\n- Since there is no record of a second round between RC Lens and Olympique Lyonnais, we cannot confirm a scoreless leg for this matchup.\n\n### Step 2: Check the First Round of FC Nantes vs RC Strasbourg\n\n- **FC Nantes** played against **Olympique Lyonnais**, not RC Strasbourg. \n- Therefore, there is no record of a first round between FC Nantes and RC Strasbourg in this data.\n- Consequently, we cannot confirm a scoreless leg for this matchup either.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim mentions two specific scoreless legs that do not exist based on the table's data. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. The second round of RC Lens vs Olympique Lyonnais does not exist in the data; RC Lens played against RC Strasbourg only. \\n2. The first round of FC Nantes vs RC Strasbourg does not exist in the data; FC Nantes played against Olympique Lyonnais only. \\n3. Since neither of these matches exists, there are no scoreless legs as claimed.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The specific claim states that only two times were goals scored by an away team, with one of these instances being FC Mulhouse scoring 1 goal against Girondins de Bordeaux.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n### Step 1: Identify relevant data\nWe need to look at the \"1st round\" column for all rows in the table because this column contains scores from the first legs of matches. We are specifically interested in cases where the away team scored.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze each match in the 1st round\n\n- **Row 0:** RC Lens (D1) vs. RC Strasbourg (D1)\n  - Score: 1 - 0\n  - Away team goal: 0\n\n- **Row 1:** FC Rouen (D1) vs. Stade Lavallois (D1)\n  - Score: 1 - 0\n  - Away team goal: 0\n\n- **Row 2:** AS Monaco (D1) vs. AS Nancy (D1)\n  - Score: 2 - 0\n  - Away team goal: 0\n\n- **Row 3:** Girondins de Bordeaux (D1) vs. FC Mulhouse (D2)\n  - Score: 0 - 1\n  - Away team goal: 1\n  - Relevant to the claim.\n\n- **Row 4:** FC Nantes (D1) vs. Olympique Lyonnais (D2)\n  - Score: 0 - 0\n  - Away team goal: 0\n\n- **Row 5:** AS Cannes (D2) vs. FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard (D1)\n  - Score: 3 - 0\n  - Away team goal: 0\n\n- **Row 6:** Sporting Toulon Var (D1) vs. En Avant Guingamp (D2)\n  - Score: 2 - 0\n  - Away team goal: 0\n\n- **Row 7:** FC Metz (D1) vs. Besan\u00e7on RC (D2)\n  - Score: 4 - 0\n  - Away team goal: 0\n\n### Step 3: Count away team goals in the first leg\nFrom the analysis, only one match (Row 3) had an away team score in the first round.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim states that \"only 2 be score by an away team,\" but based on our analysis, there is only one instance where an away team scored in the first leg.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to evaluate both components: \n\n1. The highest scoring leg.\n2. The highest aggregate score for a match.\n\nFinally, we check if these conditions pertain specifically to \"fc nantes vs besan\u00e7on rc.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Matches Involving FC Nantes and Besan\u00e7on RC**\n\n- According to the table, there is no direct match between \"FC Nantes\" and \"Besan\u00e7on RC\". However, we can verify that the claim states \"fc nantes vs besan\u00e7on rc\", which implies this should be a consideration if it were true.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Matches with Their Scores**\n\n- Look at all entries in the table to find matches with scores and calculate aggregates:\n  - **RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg**: \n    - Aggregate Score = 1 + 0 (1st round) + 0 + 0 (2nd round) = 1\n  - **FC Rouen vs Stade Lavallois**:\n    - Aggregate Score = 1 + 0 + 1 + 3 = 5\n  - **AS Monaco vs AS Nancy**:\n    - Aggregate Score = 2 + 0 + 4 + 1 = 7\n  - **Girondins de Bordeaux vs FC Mulhouse**:\n    - Aggregate Score = 0 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 5\n  - **FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais**:\n    - Aggregate Score = 0 + 0 + 4 + 4 = 8\n  - **AS Cannes vs FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard**:\n    - Aggregate Score = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 5\n  - **Sporting Toulon Var vs En Avant Guingamp**:\n    - Aggregate Score = 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 3\n  - **FC Metz vs Besan\u00e7on RC**:\n    - Aggregate Score = 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 6\n\n- The highest aggregate score is found in the match between FC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnais with a total of 8 goals.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Highest Scoring Leg**\n\n- Determine which leg had the most goals scored:\n  - **RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg**: Maximum goals in a single leg = 1\n  - **FC Rouen vs Stade Lavallois**: Maximum goals in a single leg = 1 or 3 (second leg)\n  - **AS Monaco vs AS Nancy**: Maximum goals in a single leg = 4 (second leg)\n  - **Girondins de Bordeaux vs FC Mulhouse**: Maximum goals in a single leg = 2\n  - **FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais**: Maximum goals in a single leg = 4 (second leg)\n  - **AS Cannes vs FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard**: Maximum goals in a single leg = 3\n  - **Sporting Toulon Var vs En Avant Guingamp**: Maximum goals in a single leg = 2\n  - **FC Metz vs Besan\u00e7on RC**: Maximum goals in a single leg = 4 (first leg)\n\n- The highest scoring legs are:\n  - AS Monaco vs AS Nancy and FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais both have a maximum of 4 goals in a single leg.\n  - FC Metz vs Besan\u00e7on RC has one of the highest single-leg scores, with 4 goals.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Claim**\n\n- The claim states \"the highest scoring leg, and highest aggregate score for a match, total 8 goals, with fc nantes vs besancon rc.\"\n- From our analysis:\n  - The highest aggregate is indeed 8 goals but it was achieved by FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais.\n  - The highest scoring leg (4 goals) involves AS Monaco, FC Nantes, and FC Metz. None of these matches involve \"Besan\u00e7on RC\" with \"FC Nantes\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because while the aggregate score of 8 was achieved by FC Nantes, it wasn't against Besan\u00e7on RC but Olympique Lyonnais.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Identified matches and calculated their aggregates: Highest is FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais (8 goals). 2. Checked for highest scoring leg: Found multiple matches with 4 goals per leg, none of which are between FC Nantes and Besan\u00e7on RC. 3. Claim checks if both conditions apply to FC Nantes vs Besan\u00e7on RC - they do not.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"2nd round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
