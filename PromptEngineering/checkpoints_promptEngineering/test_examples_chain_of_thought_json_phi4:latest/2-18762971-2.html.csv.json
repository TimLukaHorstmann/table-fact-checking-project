Let's go through the process step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that there should be four games with a result of \"0 - 0\", meaning neither team scored any goals in those matches.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**: We need to focus on the \"result\" column of each row to find occurrences where the result is \"0 - 0\".\n\n3. **Scan Each Game Result**:\n   - Start by examining each entry under the \"result\" column.\n   - Count how many times the result is exactly \"0 - 0\".\n\n4. **Count Occurrences**:\n   - Review the table and count each instance of \"0 - 0\":\n     - **30 September 2000**: Gillingham vs. Opponent, Result: \"0 - 2\" (Not a \"0 - 0\")\n     - **13 January 2001**: Blackburn Rovers vs. Opponent, Result: \"0 - 2\" (Not a \"0 - 0\")\n     - **24 February 2001**: Preston North End vs. Opponent, Result: \"0 - 2\" (Not a \"0 - 0\")\n     - **7 March 2001**: Portsmouth vs. Opponent, Result: \"0 - 0\"\n     - **6 May 2001**: Crewe Alexandra vs. Opponent, Result: \"0 - 0\"\n\n5. **Evaluate the Count**:\n   - We identified two games with a result of \"0 - 0\":\n     - Row 29 (7 March 2001): Portsmouth vs. Opponent\n     - Row 56 (6 May 2001): Crewe Alexandra vs. Opponent\n\n6. **Conclusion**: There are only two instances where the result was \"0 - 0\", not four as claimed.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe claim that there be 4 different games where no goal be score by either side is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Reviewed each game's result in the table and counted occurrences of '0 - 0'.
