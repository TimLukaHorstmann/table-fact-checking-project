We need these columns to verify if the actor playing Alvin Seville is consistent across all entries from 1987 to 2011.\n\n2. **Check Each Entry from 1987 to 2011**:\n   - For each row in the data, check if \"Alvin Seville\" appears under the \"role\" column and ensure that the \"actor\" entry is marked as \"yes\", indicating an actor was involved.\n   \n3. **Analyze Entries for Consistency**:\n   - From the table:\n     - 1987: Alvin Seville is listed in roles, and \"actor\" is \"yes\".\n     - 1999: Alvin Seville is listed in roles, and \"actor\" is \"yes\".\n     - 2000: Alvin Seville is listed in roles, and \"actor\" is \"yes\".\n     - 2005: Alvin Seville is listed in roles, and \"actor\" is \"yes\".\n     - 2007: Alvin Seville is listed in roles, and \"actor\" is \"yes\".\n     - 2009: Alvin Seville is listed in roles, and \"actor\" is \"yes\".\n     - 2011: Alvin Seville is listed in roles, and \"actor\" is \"yes\".\n\n4. **Consistency Across All Years**:\n   - The table confirms that for each year from 1987 to 2011, the role of Alvin Seville was played by an actor. However, the table does not specify whether it was the same individual playing this role across all these years.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - While the data shows that an actor consistently portrayed Alvin Seville each year, there is no explicit information confirming that it was the \"same\" actor throughout the entire period from 1987 to 2011.

There are no multiple actors listed for this role in any year from 1987 to 2011.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis above, there is no evidence in the data that more than one actor has played Alvin Seville between 1987 and 2011. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim suggests three different actors played Alvin Seville from 1987 to 2011.
