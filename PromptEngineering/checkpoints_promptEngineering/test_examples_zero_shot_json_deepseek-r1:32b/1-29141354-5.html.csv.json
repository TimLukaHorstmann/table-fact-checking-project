    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's see what I need to do here. The task is to determine if the claim about a specific table entry is TRUE or FALSE based on the given JSON data.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim: \"jessica ennis be the guest on andrew and jack guest episode broadcast on 4 may 2012.\" So, the key points here are that Jessica Ennis was the guest on an episode of Andrew and Jack's show, specifically the one aired on April 4, 2012.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns like \"episode\", \"first broadcast\", \"andrew and jacks guest\", etc. I need to check each row in the data to see if Jessica Ennis is listed as a guest and whether that episode was broadcast on May 4, 2012.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one. \n\nRow 0: Episode 05x01, April 20, 2012. Guest is Georgie Thompson. Not relevant.\nRow 1: 05x02, April 27, Louise Hazel. Nope.\nRow 2: 05x03, May 4, and the guest is Jessica Ennis. Wait, that's exactly what the claim says! So this row has both the correct date and the correct guest.\n\nSo, the relevant cell for the guest would be under \"andrew and jacks guest\" column in row 2. And the broadcast date matches as well, so no need to check other rows since we've already found a match.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Jessica Ennis was indeed the guest on that specific episode broadcast on May 4, 2012.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"andrew and jacks guest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"first broadcast\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format. The claim is: \"the first broadcast with jessica ennis as andrew and jack guest be before may 2012.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse the JSON data correctly. Looking at the columns:\n\n- \"episode\"\n- \"first broadcast\"\n- \"andrew and jacks guest\"\n- \"jamies guests peter crouch replaced jamie redknapp as team captain for one week in series 5  , episode 2\"\n- \"scores\"\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. The fourth column has a long name, which probably isn't relevant here. So the important columns are \"episode,\" \"first broadcast,\" and \"andrew and jacks guest.\"\n\nThe claim is about Jessica Ennis being the Andrew and Jack guest and whether her first broadcast was before May 2012.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\nRow indices go from 0 to 6 (assuming starting at 0). Let's check each row where the guest is Jessica Ennis. \n\nRow index 2 has:\n- \"episode\": \"05x03\"\n- \"first broadcast\": \"4 may 2012\"\n- \"andrew and jacks guest\": \"jessica ennis\"\n\nSo this is the only entry for Jessica Ennis as a guest. The first broadcast date here is May 4, 2012.\n\nThe claim says that the first broadcast with her was before May 2012. Since May 4 is in May, it's not before May; it's within May. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because the broadcast isn't before May\u2014it's on May 4th, which is during May.\n\nTo confirm, I'll check if there are any earlier rows where she was a guest, but looking through the data, row index 2 is the only one with her name. So that's the only relevant cell needed to assess the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Jessica Ennis's first broadcast as Andrew and Jack's guest was before May 2012. According to the table, her first broadcast was on April 4, 2012, which is indeed before May.\n\nWait no, hold on. Wait, looking back: the first broadcast for row index 2 is \"4 may 2012.\" So that's May 4th, 2012. The claim says it should be before May 2012, meaning in April or earlier. But since her broadcast was in May, the claim is FALSE.\n\n{  \n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [  \n     {  \n       \"row_index\": 2,\n       \"column_name\": \"first broadcast\"\n     },\n     {  \n       \"row_index\": 2,\n       \"column_name\": \"andrew and jacks guest\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n\nWait, no\u2014the correct answer is FALSE because the first broadcast was in May.
