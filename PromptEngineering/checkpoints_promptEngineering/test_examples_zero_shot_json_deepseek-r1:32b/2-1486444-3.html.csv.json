    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"at the shooto 2003 event on march 18th in tokyo , japan , he battle with fighter rumina sato\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the components of the claim:\n\n1. The event name: \"shhooto 2003\"\n2. The date: March 18th\n3. The location: Tokyo, Japan\n4. The fighter he battled: rumina sato\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a different fight with details like event name, result (win/loss), date, location, and opponent.\n\nI'll go through each relevant piece of information step by step.\n\nStarting with the event name \"shhooto 2003\". Looking at the 'Event' column in the table, I find an entry that says \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\". The slight spelling difference (\"shhooto\" vs. \"shooto\") might be a typo, but it's likely referring to the same event.\n\nNext, the date mentioned is March 18th. In the table, for the event \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\", the date is listed as \"2003-03-18\", which matches March 18th.\n\nThe location is Tokyo, Japan. The 'Location' column for that row shows \"tokyo  , japan\", so that's a match.\n\nFinally, the opponent is rumina sato. Checking the 'Opponent' column in that same row, it says \"rumina sato\". So this also matches.\n\nPutting it all together: the event name (allowing for minor spelling differences), date, location, and opponent all align with the claim. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's an event called \"dream 11\" in the table. Looking through the 'Event' column, I don't see any entries that mention \"dream 11\". The closest I find is \"Dream 11\", but it might be a typo or just not present.\n\nNext, I should check if there's a fight against Shinya Aoki. Scanning the 'Opponent' column, I notice there are two fights against Shinya Aoki. One is in row 3 where the outcome was a loss at 2:37 minutes, and another in row 5 where it's also a loss but the time isn't specified\u2014it just says \"n/a\". \n\nThe claim mentions the fight went to 4:56, but neither of these rows show that duration. The first fight against Aoki ended quickly at 2:37, which is much shorter than 4:56. The second entry doesn't have a time listed, so I can't confirm it went that long.\n\nSince there's no mention of \"dream 11\" and the durations don't match for the fights with Shinya Aoki, the claim isn't supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Time\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The task is to verify a claim based on the provided data table and determine if it's TRUE or FALSE.\n\nThe claim is: \"shooto 2003: 3  / 18 be the event in turku , finland and have an opponent of rumina sato\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this claim is stating. It seems to suggest that there was an event named \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\" held in Turku, Finland, where Rumina Sato was the opponent.\n\nNow, looking at the data table provided, each row represents a fight with various details like date, location, opponent, result, etc. The columns are:\n\n- Date\n- Location\n- Opponent\n- Result\n- Event\n- Round\n- Time\n\nI need to check two main points from the claim:\n\n1. **Event Name and Location**: Is there an event named \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\" that took place in Turku, Finland?\n2. **Opponent's Name**: Was the opponent in that event Rumina Sato?\n\nLet's go through each row to find relevant information.\n\nStarting from the top of the table:\n\n- The first few rows (indices 0 to about 35) show various events, locations, and opponents.\n- Scanning for \"Turku, Finland\" in the Location column might help pinpoint the event. Also, looking for \"Rumina Sato\" as the Opponent.\n\nUpon reviewing each row:\n\nI notice that Row 27 has:\n- Event: \"shooto finland : capital punishment 2\"\n- Location: \"helsinki , finland\"\n\nWait, that's Helsinki, not Turku. So, perhaps another row?\n\nLooking further down:\n\nRow 31 mentions:\n- Opponent: \"rumina sato\"\n- Event: \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\"\n- Location: \"tokyo , japan\"\n\nAh, here's the event named \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\" with opponent Rumina Sato. However, the location is Tokyo, Japan, not Turku, Finland.\n\nSo, according to this row, the event took place in Tokyo, which contradicts the claim that it was in Turku, Finland.\n\nTherefore, while there's an event named \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\" with Rumina Sato as the opponent, it occurred in Tokyo, not Turku.

The claim is: \"dream 11 be the event at 5:00 with the opponent of caol uno.\" I need to verify if this statement holds true based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. **Event Name**: The event in question is \"dream 11.\"\n2. **Duration/Time**: It's supposed to last or occur at \"5:00.\"\n3. **Opponent**: The opponent's name is \"caol uno.\"\n\nNow, I'll look through the table rows to find any information that matches these components.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- **Row 1**: Event is \"DREAM 11\" (case-insensitive match).

Let me break down what each part of the claim means and then check against the data.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. The table has several columns: Date, Event, Opponent, Result, Round, Time, Location. Each row represents a different match or event with details about that specific encounter.\n\nThe claim mentions \"round 3\" and \"at 3:50\". So I'm looking for an instance where the round number is 3 and the time taken in that round was 3 minutes and 50 seconds, which would be represented as \"3:50\" in the Time column.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one to check if any of them have Round = 3 and Time = 3:50. \n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n- Row 0: Round is n/a, so that's not relevant.\n- Row 1: Round is n/a again.\n- Row 2: Round is 3, but the Time is 3:50. That seems to fit exactly what the claim says.\n\nWait, let me double-check that row. The Opponent is Metin Yakut, Result is TKO (punches), and Time is indeed 3:50 in Round 3. So this matches perfectly.\n\nI'll keep checking other rows just to make sure there are no other instances or discrepancies:\n- Row 3: Round is 2, Time is 2:37.\n- Row 4: Round is 3, Time is 5:00.\n- And so on down the table. The only row where both Round is 3 and Time is 3:50 is row 18 (if we start counting from 0). Wait, no, let me recount.\n\nWait, actually, in the JSON provided, the rows are ordered with index starting at 0. So row 2 has Opponent as Metin Yakut, Round 3, Time 3:50. Let me confirm that:\n\nLooking back:\nRow indices start from 0. The row where Round is 3 and Time is 3:50 is indeed present in the table. So the claim is supported by this data.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are in Row 2 under 'Round' and 'Time'.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"round 3 be at 3:50\" is true because there's a match where the round was 3 and the time was exactly 3:50.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Time\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim is saying. It states that in Pride Bushido 10, there was no instance where a fight ended with a KO via knee strike. So, my task is to check if any of the fights listed under \"Pride Bushido 10\" used the KO (knee) method.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see several entries for different events, including \"pride bushido 10\". Each row in the table represents a fight with various details like event name, outcome, method of finish, and so on. The columns are: 'Event', 'Result', 'Opponent', 'Method', 'Round', 'Time', and 'Location'.\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to examine all rows where the Event is \"pride bushido 10\" and check if any of them have a Method that includes \"KO (knee)\". \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 2: Event is \"pride bushido 9\", not relevant.\nRow 3: Event is \"pride bushido 10\". The Method here is \"TKO (punches)\" \u2013 not a KO via knee.\nRow 4: Also \"pride bushido 10\" with Method \"Decision (majority)\" \u2013 no KO.\nRow 5: Another \"pride bushido 10\", Method \"KO (knee)\". Wait, that's exactly what the claim is about. So this row shows a fight in Pride Bushido 10 where the method was KO via knee. That means the claim is false because there is at least one instance where KO (knee) was used.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure I'm not missing any other entries for \"pride bushido 10\". Let me check all rows:\n\nLooking back, only row 3,4,5 are under \"pride bushido 10\". Among them, row 5 has the Method as \"KO (knee)\". Therefore, since there is a fight in Pride Bushido 10 where the method was KO via knee, the claim that it never happened is false.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cell is in row index 5, under the 'Method' column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because one of the fights in \"pride bushido 10\" ended with a KO via knee method.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** Look for rows where the Event is \"pride bushido 10\".\n2. **Check Method Column:** For each identified row, check if the Method is \"KO (knee)\".\n3. **Determine Outcome:** Since one such entry exists, the claim that it never happened is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 5,\n       \"column_name\": \"Method\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",
