    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table in JSON format. The claim states: \"both the bellevue bruin and the york panther play in the midland conference.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two mascots: \"bellevue bruin\" and \"york panther.\" I need to check if both of these teams are part of the \"midland conference.\"\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are school, mascot, conference, national titles, founded. The relevant information here is the 'mascot' and 'conference' for each row.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"bellevue bruin.\" I'll scan through the 'mascot' column to find this entry. \n\nLooking at the data:\n- Row 0 has \"bellevue bruins\" as the mascot. So, that's a match.\nThe conference for row 0 is listed under the 'conference' column as \"midlands.\" Hmm, the claim says \"midland conference,\" but in the table it's written as \"midlands.\" I need to decide if these are considered the same. Since the names are similar and both refer to conferences in that area, it's reasonable to assume they're the same.\n\nNext, checking for \"york panther\":\nI'll look through each row's 'mascot' column.\n- Row 8 has \"york panthers\" as the mascot. That matches the claim.\nThe conference for row 8 is also \"midlands,\" just like row 0.\n\nSo both mascots are associated with teams in the \"midland\" (or \"midlands\") conference. Therefore, the claim appears to be supported by the data.\n\nNow, compiling the relevant cells:\n- For \"bellevue bruin\": row 0's 'conference' is checked.\n- For \"york panther\": row 8's 'conference' is checked.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are at rows 0 and 8 under the 'conference' column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"conference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"conference\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table in JSON format and a claim they want me to evaluate as either TRUE or FALSE. My task is to determine the answer and specify which cells in the table were relevant for making that determination.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim clearly. It says: \"according to date of founding, peru state college be the oldest.\" So, the claim is stating that Peru State College is the oldest among the listed schools based on their founding dates.\n\nNext, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are school, mascot, conference, national titles, and founded. The relevant column here is \"founded\" because we're dealing with the date of founding.\n\nI need to check each row's \"founded\" value to find out which school was established earliest. Let me list them out:\n\n1. Bellevue University: 1966\n2. College of Saint Mary: 1923\n3. Concordia University: 1894\n4. Doane College: 1872\n5. Hastings College: 1882\n6. Midland University: 1883\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887\n8. Peru State College: 1865\n9. York College: 1890\n\nLooking at these dates, the oldest founding year is 1865, which corresponds to Peru State College. So the claim that Peru State College is the oldest according to the date of founding holds true.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells in the table. Each school's \"founded\" column is important because we're comparing all of them. Therefore, every row has a cell under the \"founded\" column that contributes to verifying the claim. \n\nWait a minute, but do I need to include all these rows? The user's example included only two cells, so maybe I should think again. Perhaps only the row for Peru State College is relevant since it's the one being claimed as the oldest. However, in reality, to verify that Peru State is indeed the oldest, I have to look at all the founding dates of every school listed. Without checking each one, I can't be certain if Peru State is the earliest.\n\nBut looking back at the instructions, they ask for cells relevant to verify the claim. Since the claim is about Peru State being the oldest, the main focus is on its founding date. However, to confirm it's the oldest, we need to compare it with all others. So, in this case, I think including all the \"founded\" cells from each row would be necessary because without comparing them, we can't validate the claim.\n\nWait, no. The user might only require the relevant cells that directly support the claim. In other words, if the claim is about Peru State College being the oldest, then only its own founded date is needed. But that doesn't make sense because to determine if it's the oldest, you have to check all others as well.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The instruction says: \"Carefully check each condition in the claim against the table and determine which cells are relevant to verify the claim.\" So, for each school, their founded date is a cell that contributes to verifying whether Peru State is indeed the oldest. Therefore, all these cells are relevant because they're part of the data used to compare.\n\nBut let me think again: If I only check Peru State's founding year, it's 1865, but without comparing to others, how can I be sure? So, maybe the relevant cells are all the \"founded\" columns for each school. That way, when we look at all of them, we see that 1865 is indeed the earliest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only Peru State's row and the column is needed because the claim is about it specifically. But to confirm its status as the oldest, you have to look at all other founding dates too.\n\nI think the correct approach is to include all rows' \"founded\" cells because each contributes to determining if Peru State is indeed the oldest. Without considering each one, we can't verify the claim fully.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether Peru State College is the oldest according to the date of founding, we examine the \"founded\" column for all schools.\n\n- The earliest founded year is 1865 (Peru State College).\n- All other schools were founded after this year.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells include the \"founded\" column for each school to compare their founding dates.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says, \"only 1 school, york college, have win more than 20 titles.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It mentions that only York College has won more than 20 national titles. So, I need to check two things: how many schools have more than 20 titles and whether it's exactly York College.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school with columns including \"school,\" \"mascot,\" \"conference,\" \"national titles,\" and \"founded.\" The relevant column here is \"national titles.\"\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to check the number of national titles:\n\n1. Bellevue University: 14 titles.\n2. College of Saint Mary: 0 titles.\n3. Concordia University: 1 title.\n4. Doane College: 10 titles.\n5. Hastings College: 3 titles.\n6. Midland University: 2 titles.\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University: 19 titles.\n8. Peru State College: 2 titles.\n9. York College: 28 titles.\n\nNow, I need to see which schools have more than 20 titles. Checking each number:\n\n- Bellevue has 14, which is less than 20.\n- York has 28, which is more than 20.\n- Nebraska Wesleyan has 19, just below 20.\n\nSo only York College meets the condition of having over 20 titles. \n\nWait a second, let me double-check Nebraska Wesleyan's number\u2014it says 19, which isn't more than 20. So yes, only York is above that threshold.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because York is the sole school with more than 20 national titles.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"}\n   ]\n}",

The claim states: \"with a total of 0, the lowest number of national title belongs to the college of saint mary.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns for school, mascot, conference, national titles, and founded. So, the relevant column here is \"national titles.\"\n\nI need to find all entries under \"national titles\" to identify which school has the lowest number. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. Bellevue University: 14 titles\n2. College of Saint Mary: 0 titles\n3. Concordia University: 1 title\n4. Doane College: 10 titles\n5. Hastings College: 3 titles\n6. Midland University: 2 titles\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University: 19 titles\n8. Peru State College: 2 titles\n9. York College: 28 titles\n\nLooking at these numbers, the lowest is clearly 0, which belongs to the College of Saint Mary. There's no other school with a lower number than that. \n\nSo the claim accurately states that the college has the lowest number of national titles with 0. Therefore, it should be TRUE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells, I'll look at each row in the \"national titles\" column to verify this. Specifically, each row's entry under \"national titles\" is important because it shows their respective counts. The claim focuses on the College of Saint Mary, so that specific cell (row 1) and all others to confirm there's nothing lower are necessary.\n\nWait a second\u2014actually, for determining if 0 is indeed the lowest, I only need to check if any other school has less than 0. Since \"national titles\" can't be negative, 0 is the minimum possible. But just to be thorough, I should look at all rows in that column to ensure there's no entry lower than 0.\n\nBut given the data provided, none have negative values.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"In terms of its founding date, the youngest school be Bellevue University.\" Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It's saying that Bellevue University is the youngest school in the list when considering their founding dates. So, being the youngest would mean it was founded most recently, right? That makes sense because 'youngest' typically refers to something that started more recently compared to others.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are several schools listed with their respective founding years under the \"founded\" column. My task is to check each school's founding date and determine if Bellevue University indeed has the latest founding year.\n\nLet me list out the schools along with their founding dates from the data:\n\n1. Bellevue University: 1966\n2. College of Saint Mary: 1923\n3. Concordia University: 1894\n4. Doane College: 1872\n5. Hastings College: 1882\n6. Midland University: 1883\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887\n8. Peru State College: 1865\n9. York College: 1890\n\nNow, I'll go through each of these founding years to see which is the most recent. The latest year here would indicate the youngest school.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- Bellevue University was founded in 1966.\n- Next is College of Saint Mary at 1923, which is older than 1966.\n- Concordia University in 1894, definitely older.\n- Doane College: 1872, much older.\n- Hastings College: 1882, still before 1923 and 1966.\n- Midland University: 1883, same as above.\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887, which is also older than 1923 but not as old as some others.\n- Peru State College: 1865, very early.\n- York College: 1890, again, before 1923.\n\nSo, compiling all these, the most recent founding date is 1966 for Bellevue University. All other schools were founded earlier than that. Therefore, in terms of founding dates, Bellevue University is indeed the youngest school listed here.\n\nTo double-check, I'll ensure there are no other schools with a founding year after 1966. Looking through all rows again, the next closest after 1966 would be if any had a date between 1966 and now, but in this table, none do. The next one is College of Saint Mary at 1923, which is still older.\n\nThus, the claim that Bellevue University is the youngest based on its founding date holds true.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}]}",

The key points are:\n1. Bellevue Bruins are a team from Nebraska.\n2. They play in the Midland Conference.\n3. No other Nebraska teams are in the Midland Conference.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a school with its mascot and conference. The columns are \"school\", \"mascot\", \"conference\", \"national titles\", and \"founded\".\n\nFirst, I'll check if Bellevue University (with mascot Bellevue Bruins) is in Nebraska. From the data:\n- Row 0: School is \"bellevue university\" with Mascot \"bellevue bruins\" and Conference \"midlands\". This confirms point 1 and 2.\n\nNext, I need to verify if any other Nebraska teams are in the Midland Conference.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"peru state college be the last institution found in the 19th century\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim is saying. It mentions two main points: Peru State College and it being the last institution founded in the 19th century. So, I need to check if Peru State College was indeed the last one established in that century according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table's data, there are multiple schools listed with their founding years. The column for \"founded\" is what's important here. I'll go through each row and note down the school names along with their founding years to see which ones fall within the 19th century, which spans from 1801 to 1900.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\n1. Bellevue University - Founded in 1966. That's way beyond the 19th century.\n2. College of Saint Mary - 1923. Also in the 20th century, so not relevant here.\n3. Concordia University - 1894. Okay, that's within the 19th century.\n4. Doane College - 1872. Also in the 19th century.\n5. Hastings College - 1882. Yep, still in the 19th.\n6. Midland University - 1883. Also fits.\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University - 1887. Within the 19th century as well.\n8. Peru State College - 1865. That's definitely in the 19th.\n9. York College - 1890. Still within.\n\nSo, from this, I can see several institutions were founded in the 19th century: Concordia University (1894), Doane College (1872), Hastings College (1882), Midland University (1883), Nebraska Wesleyan University (1887), Peru State College (1865), and York College (1890).\n\nWait, the claim says Peru State College is the last one. Last would mean it was founded in the latest year among those in the 19th century. Let's see: the latest founding years from these are Concordia University at 1894, York College at 1890, Nebraska Wesleyan at 1887, Midland at 1883, Hastings at 1882, Doane at 1872, and Peru at 1865.\n\nSo the latest founding year in the 19th century among these is Concordia University in 1894. York College is next at 1890. So Peru State College was founded in 1865, which isn't the last one. Therefore, the claim that Peru State College is the last institution founded in the 19th century isn't true because there are others with later founding years within that same century.\n\nWait a second\u2014am I misinterpreting \"last\"? Maybe it's about being the last to be established in the 19th century compared to others, but according to the data, several were founded after Peru. So, yeah, the claim is false because there are other institutions with later founding dates within the same century.\n\nSo, the relevant cells here would include the \"founded\" column for each of these schools. But since the user wants only the cells relevant to verify the claim, I should list all the rows where the school was founded in the 19th century and their founding years. That way, we can compare each one's founding date.\n\nSo the rows involved are:\n\nRow indices: 2 (Concordia), 3 (Doane), 4 (Hastings), 5 (Midland), 6 (Nebraska Wesleyan), 7 (Peru State), and 8 (York). Each has their \"founded\" year in the \"founded\" column.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Peru State College was founded in 1865, but there are other institutions with later founding years within the same century.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if Peru State College was the last institution founded in the 19th century according to the table, we examine each school's founding year.

Among these, the latest founding year is 1894 for Concordia University.

Since 0 is much lower than the others, especially 28, it's clear that College of Saint Mary does not hold the highest number.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "claim": "only 2 school , york college and peru state college , have win more than 20 time",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, I have a table in JSON format with some data about different schools and their sports teams. The claim is that only two schools, York College and Peru State College, have won more than 20 times. I need to check if this claim is true or false based on the data provided.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: school, mascot, conference, national titles, founded. The relevant column here for checking the number of wins is \"national titles,\" which I assume represents the number of times each school has won a national title.\n\nThe claim says that only two schools have more than 20 national titles. Let's go through each row one by one to see how many titles each school has.\n\n1. Bellevue University: They have 14 national titles.\n   - That's less than 20, so this doesn't count.\n\n2. College of Saint Mary: They have 0 national titles.\n   - Definitely not more than 20.\n\n3. Concordia University: They have 1 national title.\n   - Also way below 20.\n\n4. Doane College: 10 national titles.\n   - Still under 20.\n\n5. Hastings College: 3 national titles.\n   - Not enough.\n\n6. Midland University: 2 national titles.\n   - Close, but still not more than 20.\n\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University: This is interesting; they have 19 national titles.\n   - The claim mentions two schools with over 20 wins, and 19 is just shy of that. So this doesn't fit the claim either.\n\n8. Peru State College: They have 2 national titles.\n   - Wait, no\u2014that's not right. Looking back at the data, row index 7 (Peru State) has 2 under \"national titles.\" Hmm, but wait a minute\u2014did I get that right? Let me double-check. Oh, yes, Peru State College has 2 national titles.\n\n9. York College: They have 28 national titles.\n   - That's more than 20.\n\nWait a second, so according to this, only York College has more than 20 national titles with 28. Nebraska Wesleyan University is at 19, which is just under. So the claim says two schools: York and Peru State. But Peru State actually has 2, not over 20. That means the claim is incorrect because it's only one school (York) that meets the criteria.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because only York College has more than 20 national titles, and Peru State doesn't meet that threshold.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that two schools have won more than 20 times. Checking each school's \"national titles\":\n\n- York College: 28 (more than 20)\n- All others have fewer than 20.\n\nThus, only one school meets the condition. The claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"bellevue university be the first college found in the 20th century.\" I need to determine if this is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asserting. It's stating that Bellevue University was the first college founded in the 20th century. So, my task is to check two things: when Bellevue University was founded and whether any other colleges in the table were founded later than 1966 but still within the 20th century.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school with details including the year it was founded. The columns are \"school,\" \"mascot,\" \"conference,\" \"national titles,\" and \"founded.\" I need to focus on the \"founded\" column for all schools.\n\nStarting with Bellevue University: According to the data, it was founded in 1966. Now, I'll look at the other colleges to see if any were founded after 1966 but before the end of the 20th century (which is 1999). \n\nChecking each school:\n- College of Saint Mary: Founded in 1923.\n- Concordia University: 1894.\n- Doane College: 1872.\n- Hastings College: 1882.\n- Midland University: 1883.\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887.\n- Peru State College: 1865.\n- York College: 1890.\n\nLooking through these, none of the other colleges were founded after 1966. The next closest is York College in 1890, which is still well before 1966 and within the 19th century.\n\nTherefore, since Bellevue University was founded in 1966 and no other college in the table was founded between 1967 and 1999, the claim holds true. There's no other school in this dataset that could have been founded later than 1966 but still within the 20th century.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
