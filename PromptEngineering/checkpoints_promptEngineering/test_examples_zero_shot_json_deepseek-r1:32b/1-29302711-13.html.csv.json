Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are rk, name, country, matches played, matches won, points, prize money (usd). So each row represents a player with their respective stats.\n\nThe claim mentions two people: Ken Rosewall and Brian Fairlie. I need to check their countries to see if both are from Australia.\n\nLooking at the data array:\n\n1. The first row is index 0: name \"ken rosewall\", country \"aus\". So Ken is from Australia.\n2. Next, I look for Brian Fairlie. Scanning through the names, I find him in row index 5: \"brian fairlie\", country \"aus\". Wait, no\u2014row index 5 has \"brian fairlie\" with country \"aus\"? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, actually, looking again at row 5 (index 5), it's \"brian fairlie\" from \"aus\"? Or is that not correct? No, wait, in the table provided:\n\nRow indices are 0 to 8 because there are 9 rows. Wait no, let me recount:\n\nThe data array has 9 elements, each being a row. So row indexes go from 0 to 8.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 0: Ken Rosewall, aus.\n- Row 1: Arthur Ashe, usa.\n- Row 2: Marty Riessen, usa.\n- Row 3: Roger Taylor, gbr.\n- Row 4: Mark Cox, gbr.\n- Row 5: Brian Fairlie, aus? Wait no\u2014looking back at the data:\n\nWait the sixth element is [6, \"brian fairlie\", \"aus\", ...], so that's row index 5. So country is \"aus\".\n\nSo both Ken Rosewall (row 0) and Brian Fairlie (row 5) have their country as \"aus\", which stands for Australia.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because both are from Australia.\n\nI should collect the relevant cells: for each person, the row index and column 'country'.

The claim states: \"roscoe tanner be the ninth rank tennis player for the 1973 world tennis circuit.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into parts to see which columns in the table are relevant.\n\nThe main points in the claim are:\n1. Name of the player: Roscoe Tanner\n2. Rank: Ninth (9th)\n3. Year: 1973 World Tennis Circuit\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns like \"rk\" for rank, \"name\", and others like matches played, etc.\n\nI'll start by checking if Roscoe Tanner is in the table. Scanning through the \"name\" column:\n\nRow 0: ken rosewall\nRow 1: arthur ashe\nRow 2: marty riessen\nRow 3: roger taylor\nRow 4: mark cox\nRow 5: brian fairlie\nRow 6: jan kode...\nRow 7: tom okker\nRow 8: roscoe tanner\n\nYes, Roscoe Tanner is in row index 8.\n\nNext, checking his rank. The \"rk\" column for row 8 is 9. So he is ranked ninth, which matches the claim.\n\nNow, regarding the year 1973. The table doesn't have a specific column indicating the year. It just lists players with their stats, but there's no mention of the year anywhere in the table data provided. Without the year specified, we can't confirm if this ranking is indeed for 1973.\n\nSince the table doesn't provide information about the year, we can't verify that part of the claim. Therefore, while Roscoe Tanner is ranked ninth in the table, we don't have evidence to support or refute whether this ranking corresponds to 1973.\n\nBecause the table lacks data on the year, we cannot fully support the entire claim. Hence, it should be considered FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim can't be fully supported as the table doesn't specify the year, so while Roscoe Tanner is ninth, we don't know if it's for 1973.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"rk\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So, I'll check Ken Rosewall's prize money.\n\nLooking at the data, Ken Rosewall is in row 0 (index starts at 0) and his prize money is $66,400.\n\nNext, the claim mentions Tom Okker and Roscoe Tanner.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"roscoe tanner be first ranked tennis player for the 1973 world tennis circuit\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is referring to. The key elements are:\n\n1. **Roscoe Tanner**: This refers to a specific person in the table.\n2. **First ranked**: This means checking if Roscoe Tanner has the highest rank (lowest number) in the ranking column, which is \"rk\" in the table.\n3. **Tennis player for the 1973 world tennis circuit**: The claim mentions a specific year and event, but the table doesn't provide information about years or events.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n- Columns include: rk, name, country, matches played, matches won, points, prize money (usd).\n- There's no mention of the year 1973 or any specific circuit or tournament in the data provided. \n\nNow, focusing on Roscoe Tanner's rank:\n- Scanning through the \"name\" column, I find Roscoe Tanner in row index 8.\n- The \"rk\" (rank) for Roscoe Tanner is listed as 9.\n\nSince rank 1 would be the highest position, and Roscoe Tanner is ranked 9th, he isn't first. Additionally, there's no data about the year 1973 or any specific circuit in the table to validate that aspect of the claim.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the claim cannot be supported as TRUE because:\n- Roscoe Tanner isn't first ranked.\n- There's no data confirming his participation in the 1973 World Tennis Circuit.\n\nSo, the answer is FALSE.

So I need to check their respective data in the table to see if they each have 26 losses.\n\nLooking at the table columns: \"matches played\", \"matches won\", and \"points\". The claim refers to the number of matches lost, which isn't directly listed. However, typically, the number of losses can be calculated by subtracting the number of matches won from the total matches played.\n\nLet me find the rows for Arthur Ashe and Marty Riessen. \n\nArthur Ashe is in row index 1:\n- Matches Played: 36\n- Matches Won: 26\n\nSo his losses would be 36 - 26 = 10, not 26.\n\nMarty Riessen is in row index 2:\n- Matches Played: 36\n- Matches Won: 26\n\nSimilarly, his losses would also be 36 - 26 = 10.\n\nWait a minute, both have 10 losses each, not 26.

Then, there's \"tom ekker\" which might be a misspelling of \"tom okker\" since that's the name in row 7. Similarly, \"roscoe tanner\" is in row 8.\n\nNext, I need to find their prize money.
