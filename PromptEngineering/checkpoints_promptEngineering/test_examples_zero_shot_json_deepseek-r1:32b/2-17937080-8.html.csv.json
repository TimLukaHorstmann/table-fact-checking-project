    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"11.0 be the rank that have goal per match more than 1.237\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It seems like it's saying that rank 11.0 has a goals per match value greater than 1.237. I'll need to look through each row of the table to check if any player ranked 11 has goals per match above 1.237.\n\nLooking at the table, the 'rank' column is in the first position (index 0). The data starts from index 0 as well. Each row represents a different player and their stats for a particular season.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 0:\nRank: 1\nGoals per match: 1.217 \u2192 Less than 1.237\n\nRow 1:\nRank: 2\nGPM: 1.224 \u2192 Still less than 1.237\n\nRow 2:\nRank: 2\nGPM: 1.091 \u2192 No\n\nRow 3:\nRank: 4\nGPM: 1.0 \u2192 No\n\nRow 4:\nRank:5\nGPM:0.981\u2192No\n\nRow5:\nRank5\nGPM:0.964\u2192No\n\nRow6:\nRank7\nGPM:1.237\u2192Exactly 1.237, but the claim says \"more than\", so this doesn't count.\n\nRow7:\nRank7\nGPM:0.964\u2192No\n\nRow8:\nRank7\nGPM:0.887\u2192No\n\nRow9:\nRank10\nGPM:1.278\u2192This is more than 1.237, but rank is 10, not 11.\n\nRow10:\nRank11\nGPM:1.0\u2192Exactly 1.0, which is less than 1.237.\n\nRow11:\nRank12\nGPM:1.355\u2192More than 1.237 but rank isn't 11.\n\nRow12:\nRank12\nGPM:1.077\u2192Less\n\nRow13:\nRank12\nGPM:0.933\u2192No\n\nRow14:\nRank12\nGPM:0.913\u2192No\n\nRow15:\nRank15\nGPM:0.759\u2192No\n\nRow16:\nRank16\nGPM:1.0\u2192Exactly 1.0, less.\n\nSo looking through all the rows, I don't see any row where rank is 11 and GPM is more than 1.237. The closest was rank 10 with 1.278, but that's not rank 11. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells, we need to check each row for rank=11 and their corresponding 'goals per match'. \n\nLooking at row indices where rank is 11: that's only row 10. So the cell in column 'goals per match' of row 10 has a value of 1.0, which is not more than 1.237.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n- row_index 10 for rank\n- row_index 10 for goals per match\n\nSo in JSON format, that would be two objects with \"row_10\" and their respective column names.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there's no entry where rank=11 has a goals per match above 1.237.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"goal per match\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the player on rank 11 have less than 1.237 goal per match\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table data to find all rows where the rank is 11. The columns in the table are \"rank\", \"name\", \"season\", \"club\", \"goals\", \"apps\", and \"goals per match\".\n\nLooking at each row:\n- Row 0: rank 1\n- Row 1: rank 2\n- Row 2: rank 2 (Cristiano Ronaldo)\n- Row 3: rank 4\n- Row 4: rank 5 (Cristiano Ronaldo)\n- Row 5: rank 5 (Messi)\n- Row 6: rank 7 (Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s)\n- Row 7: rank 7 (Ronaldo)\n- Row 8: rank 7 (Messi)\n- Row 9: rank 10 (Telmo Zarra)\n- Row 10: rank 11 (Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano)\n- Rows after that have ranks higher than 11.\n\nSo the only row with rank 11 is row index 10.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"lionel messi rank 2 and score 73 goal during the 2011 / 12 season\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. Lionel Messi has a rank of 2.\n2. He scored 73 goals in the 2011/12 season.\n\nI'll go through each part step by step.\n\nLooking at the table data, I see that it's organized with columns: rank, name, season, club, goals, apps, goals per match.\n\nI need to find rows where the name is \"lionel messi\" and the season is \"2011 / 12\". Let me scan through each row:\n\nRow 0: Name is Lionel Messi, Season is 2011/12. Rank here is 1, goals are 73.\nRow 1: Also Lionel Messi, but the season is 2012/13. So that's not relevant.\n\nSo for the 2011/12 season, Messi has rank 1, not 2. That means the first part of the claim is incorrect because he was ranked 1, not 2 in that season.\n\nHowever, looking at his goals: in row 0, under \"goals\" it's 73, which matches the claim. So the number of goals is correct.\n\nBut since the rank isn't 2 as stated, the entire claim is false because one part (the rank) doesn't match. Both conditions need to be true for the claim to hold.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if there's another row where Messi has rank 2 in the same season? Let me double-check all rows with his name:\n\nRow 0: Rank 1, season 2011/12\nRow 1: Rank 2, season 2012/13\nRow 4 and 5: These are for earlier seasons (2010/11) where he's ranked 5.\n\nSo no, there's no row where Messi is rank 2 in the 2011/12 season. Therefore, the claim that he was rank 2 in that season is incorrect, even though his goals were correct.\n\nHence, the entire claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states two conditions: Lionel Messi ranked 2 and scored 73 goals during the 2011/12 season. Checking the table, Messi's rank for that season was 1, so the claim is false despite his goal count being accurate.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
