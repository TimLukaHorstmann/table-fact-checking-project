    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the largest attendance on september 11 be in the game between south florida and north florida.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It mentions that on September 11, the game with the highest attendance was between South Florida and North Florida. So my task is to check two things: whether there was a game on September 11 involving both South Florida and North Florida, and if that game indeed had the largest attendance.\n\nLooking at the table's data, each row represents a different game with various details like date, time, teams, site, broadcast, result, and attendance. The columns are \"date\", \"time\", \"visiting team\", \"home team\", \"site\", \"broadcast\", \"result\", and \"attendance\".\n\nI'll start by filtering the rows where the date is September 11 because that's when the claim takes place. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Date is September 10, so I can ignore this one.\n- Rows 1 to 6: All have September 11 as the date.\n\nNow, focusing on rows 1 to 6 (indices 1 to 6 in the data array). The claim mentions \"south florida\" and \"north florida.\" Let me check each row for these teams.\n\nRow 1:\n- Visiting team: South Florida\n- Home team: No 8 Florida\n\nWait, that's not North Florida. It's Florida (ranked 8th). So this is the game between South Florida and Florida, not North Florida. Therefore, this isn't the game mentioned in the claim.\n\nRow 2:\n- Visiting team: Indiana State\n- Home team: Cincinnati\n\nNo mention of either Florida teams here.\n\nRow 3:\n- Visiting team: Texas Southern\n- Home team: Connecticut\n\nAgain, no Florida schools involved.\n\nRow 4:\n- Visiting team: New Hampshire\n- Home team: Pittsburgh\n\nNot relevant.\n\nRow 5:\n- Visiting team: Eastern Kentucky\n- Home team: Louisville\n\nStill nothing about Florida teams.\n\nRow 6:\n- Visiting team: Syracuse\n- Home team: Washington\n\nNo, this doesn't include either South Florida or North Florida.\n\nSo after checking all September 11 games, I don't see a game involving both South Florida and North Florida. The only game with South Florida is against Florida (row 1), but there's no entry for North Florida as a team in any of these rows.\n\nSince the claim refers to a game between these two teams on that date, but such a game doesn't exist in the table, I can already suspect the claim is false. However, let me double-check if perhaps one of the home or visiting teams was misspelled or if North Florida is referred to by another name.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Row 1: South Florida vs Florida (no North Florida)\n- Other rows don't involve either team.\n\nSo no game between South Florida and North Florida on September 11. Therefore, the claim about their game having the largest attendance is automatically false because that game didn't occur according to the table.\n\nAdditionally, just to be thorough, let's check which games actually took place on September 11 and their attendances:\n\n- Row 1: Attendance 90612\n- Row 2: 30807\n- Row 3: 37359\n- Row 4: 50120\n- Row 5: 51427\n- Row 6: 62418\n\nThe highest attendance among these is 90612 in row 1, which was the game between South Florida and Florida. But since there's no North Florida involved, the claim isn't supported.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because such a game doesn't exist in the data provided.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"visiting team\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"indiana state and cincinnati on september 11 draw the least attendance with only 30807 attend the game.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions two teams, Indiana State and Cincinnati, playing on September 11, and their game had the lowest attendance of 30,807 attendees.\n\nTo verify this, I'll go through each step methodically.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Relevant Rows**\nI look at the table data to find all entries for September 11. Scanning through the 'date' column:\n- Row 1: September 10\n- Rows 2-7: September 11\n\nSo, there are six games on September 11.\n\n**Step 2: Locate Indiana State and Cincinnati Game**\nThe claim specifically mentions Indiana State (visiting team) vs. Cincinnati (home team). Looking through the rows for September 11:\n- Row 3 has \"indiana state\" as visiting team and \"cincinnati\" as home team. The attendance is 30,807.\n\n**Step 3: Check Attendance Figures**\nI need to compare this attendance with all other games on the same day to see if it's indeed the lowest.\n- Row 2: Attendance of 90,612\n- Row 4: 37,359\n- Row 5: 50,120\n- Row 6: 51,427\n- Row 7: 62,418\n\nLooking at these numbers:\n- The lowest is 30,807 (Row 3), followed by 37,359 (Row 4).\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the Claim**\nThe claim says this game has the least attendance. From the data, 30,807 is indeed lower than all other attendances on that date.\n\n**Potential Issues to Consider:**\n- Are there any other games with lower attendance? No.\n- Could there be a mistake in interpreting team names or dates? The names match exactly as mentioned.\n\nThus, the claim holds true based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE. Indiana State and Cincinnati's game on September 11 had the lowest attendance of 30,807 attendees compared to all other games on that date.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"visiting team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the home team win 5 of the 7 game play on the day list.\" \n\nFirst, I'll check how many games there are in total. Looking at the data array, there are 7 rows, each representing a game. So that's correct\u20147 games.\n\nNext, I need to identify which games were won by the home team. The \"result\" column indicates whether the home team (H) or visiting team (V) won. If it starts with 'w', the home team won; if it starts with 'l', the home team lost.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Result is \"w 24 - 21 ot\" \u2192 Home team (marshall) won.\n2. Row 1: Result is \"l 14 - 38\" \u2192 Home team (florida) lost.\n3. Row 2: Result is \"w 40 - 7\" \u2192 Home team (cincinnati) won.\n4.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's see. I need to determine whether the claim \"washington lose to syracuse in front of 62418 fan at home\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. **Who lost?** Washington lost.\n2. **To whom?** To Syracuse.\n3. **Where did this happen?** At home, meaning Washington was the home team.\n4. **How many fans were present?** 62,418.\n\nNow, I'll look through the table to find a row that matches these details.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- The rows are indexed from 0 to 6.\n- Each row has columns: date, time, visiting team, home team, site, broadcast, result, attendance.\n\nI need to find a row where:\n- The home team is Washington.\n- The visiting team is Syracuse.\n- The result shows that the home team lost (so result should indicate 'L' for loss).\n- Attendance is 62418.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Home team is Marshall, visiting is West Virginia. Not relevant.\n\nRow 1: Home team is Florida, visiting is South Florida. Result shows a loss by Florida (since it's L). But the teams here are Florida and South Florida, not Washington or Syracuse.\n\nRow 2: Home team is Cincinnati, visiting is Indiana State. Doesn't fit.\n\nRow 3: Home team is Connecticut, visiting is Texas Southern. No match.\n\nRow 4: Home team is Pittsburgh, visiting is New Hampshire. Again, no.\n\nRow 5: Home team is Louisville, visiting is Eastern Kentucky. Still not matching.\n\nRow 6: Date September 11, time 7:00 pm. Visiting team is Syracuse, home team is Washington. Result shows \"l 20 -41\". That means the home team (Washington) lost. Attendance is 62418.\n\nSo in row 6, all conditions are met:\n- Home team is Washington.\n- Visiting team is Syracuse.\n- Result: Washington loses.\n- Attendance exactly matches 62418.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by this data.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\nIn row 6:\n- \"home team\" (column name)\n- \"visiting team\"\n- \"result\"\n- \"attendance\"\n\nEach of these columns in row 6 supports a part of the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"visiting team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the game in the middle of the day, with the exception of the florida game, have lower attendance than those play late afternoon or evening.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being compared here. It seems like we're comparing games played at different times of the day\u2014middle of the day versus late afternoon/evening\u2014and looking at their attendance numbers.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several columns: date, time, visiting team, home team, site, broadcast, result, and attendance. The key columns here will be \"time\" and \"attendance.\"\n\nThe claim mentions two categories:\n1. Games in the middle of the day.\n2. Games in late afternoon or evening.\n\nAdditionally, it specifies an exception for the Florida game, so I need to identify which game that is.\n\nLet me list out all the games with their times and attendance:\n\n1. September 10: Time - 7:00 pm, Attendance - 41382\n   - This is in the evening.\n   \n2. September 11:\n   a. 12:00 pm: South Florida vs. No 8 Florida (broadcast on Big East Network)\n      Attendance - 90612\n   b. 12:00 pm: Indiana State vs. Cincinnati\n      Attendance - 30807\n   c. 12:00 pm: Texas Southern vs. Connecticut\n      Attendance - 37359\n   d. 1:00 pm: New Hampshire vs. Pittsburgh\n      Attendance - 50120\n   e. 3:30 pm: Eastern Kentucky vs. Louisville\n      Attendance - 51427\n   f. 7:00 pm: Syracuse vs. Washington\n      Attendance - 62418\n\nWait, the first entry is on September 10 at 7:00 pm, which is in the evening. Then from September 11, we have multiple games:\n\n- Three games at 12:00 pm (middle of the day)\n- One game at 1:00 pm\n- One at 3:30 pm\n- One at 7:00 pm\n\nThe claim says that except for the Florida game, the middle-of-the-day games have lower attendance than those in late afternoon or evening.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which of these are considered \"middle of the day.\" Typically, that would be around noon, so 12:00 pm. The other times (1:00 pm and 3:30 pm) might fall into late afternoon or early evening.\n\nBut let's clarify:\n\n- Middle of the day: 12:00 pm\n- Late afternoon: 1:00 pm, 3:30 pm\n- Evening: 7:00 pm\n\nThe claim mentions \"the game in the middle of the day, with the exception of the Florida game.\" So, among the games at 12:00 pm, all except the Florida game should have lower attendance than those played later.\n\nLooking at the 12:00 pm games:\n\n- South Florida vs. No 8 Florida (Florida game): Attendance - 90612\n- Indiana State vs. Cincinnati: Attendance - 30807\n- Texas Southern vs. Connecticut: Attendance - 37359\n\nSo, the Florida game has higher attendance than the other two at the same time slot.\n\nNow, comparing these to games played in late afternoon or evening:\n\nFrom September 11:\n- 1:00 pm: 50120\n- 3:30 pm: 51427\n- 7:00 pm (Sep 10): 41382\n- 7:00 pm (Sep 11): 62418\n\nSo the late afternoon/evening attendances are:\n\n41,382; 50,120; 51,427; 62,418.\n\nWait, but Sep 10 is a different day. The claim is about games on September 11, I think, because the Florida game is on Sep 11.\n\nSo focusing on Sep 11:\n\n- Middle of day (12:00 pm):\n   - Florida game: 90,612\n   - Indiana State vs Cincinnati: 30,807\n   - Texas Southern vs Connecticut: 37,359\n\n- Late afternoon/evening:\n   - 1:00 pm: 50,120\n   - 3:30 pm: 51,427\n   - 7:00 pm: 62,418\n\nNow, the claim is that except for Florida, middle-of-day games have lower attendance than late afternoon/evening.\n\nSo let's compare:\n\n- The two non-Florida middle-of-day games: 30,807 and 37,359\n- Late afternoon/evening attendances: 50,120; 51,427; 62,418\n\nIndeed, both 30k and 37k are lower than all the late afternoon numbers.\n\nBut wait, the Florida game at 12 pm has higher attendance (90,612) than any of the later games. So that's consistent with the exception.\n\nTherefore, except for Florida, the middle-of-day games have lower attendance than the late afternoon/evening games. That seems to support the claim.\n\nHowever, let me check all data points:\n\n- The Sep 10 evening game (7 pm) has 41,382 which is less than some of the later day attendances on Sep 11 but higher than others.\n\nBut since the Florida game is on Sep 11, maybe the comparison is within Sep 11 only. So:\n\nSep 11 middle-of-day games (12 pm) except Florida: 30k and 37k\n\nSep 11 late afternoon/evening: 50k, 51k, 62k\n\nSo yes, all the non-Florida middle-of-day games have lower attendance than the later games.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds based on this data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is that except for the Florida game, all other midday games (12 pm) had lower attendance compared to late afternoon and evening games. \n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Midday Games (12 pm):**\n  - Florida vs. South Florida: 90,612 (exception)\n  - Indiana State vs. Cincinnati: 30,807\n  - Texas Southern vs. Connecticut: 37,359\n\n- **Late Afternoon/Evening Games (1 pm, 3:30 pm, 7 pm):**\n  - New Hampshire vs. Pittsburgh: 50,120\n  - Eastern Kentucky vs. Louisville: 51,427\n  - Syracuse vs. Washington: 62,418\n\n**Conclusion:** \nExcept for the Florida game, all midday games had lower attendance than late afternoon and evening games.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{True}}$",

Looking at row 1, it's South Florida vs Florida, not Washington. The game with Washington is in row 6.\n\nSo the relevant attendance numbers for September 11 are:\n- South Florida (vs Florida): 90,612\n- Syracuse (vs Washington): 62,418\n\nThe highest among these is 90,612 for South Florida vs Florida.

The claim says: \"indiana state and cincinnati on september 10 draw the least attendance with only 41382 attend the game.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into parts.\n\n1. The teams involved are Indiana State and Cincinnati.\n2. The date of the game is September 10.\n3. The attendance for that game was 41,382, which is the least among all games on that day.\n\nLooking at the table data:\n\nThe first row is for September 10: It's West Virginia (visiting) vs. Marshall (home), with an attendance of 41382. So, this game had 41,382 attendees.\n\nNow, let me check all the games on September 10 and see which ones have lower or higher attendances.\n\nBut wait, in the data provided, there's only one game on September 10: Row index 0. All other rows are for September 11.\n\nSo, the claim mentions that Indiana State and Cincinnati played on September 10 with 41,382 attendees, which is the least. But looking at the table, the only game on September 10 was between West Virginia and Marshall, not Indiana State and Cincinnati.\n\nLooking further, I see that the third row (index 2) has Indiana State vs. Cincinnati, but it's on September 11, with an attendance of 30,807.\n\nSo, according to the table:\n\n- On September 10: Only one game, attendance was 41,382.\n- The next day, September 11, there are multiple games. One of them is Indiana State vs. Cincinnati with a lower attendance (30,807) than 41,382.\n\nTherefore, the claim incorrectly states that Indiana State and Cincinnati played on September 10 and had the least attendance. In reality, their game was on September 11, and even then, it's not necessarily the least for all games but is lower than the one on September 10.\n\nMoreover, since there's only one game on September 10, that game automatically has the highest attendance (and also the lowest, as it's the only one) for that date. The claim mistakenly refers to a non-existent game on September 10 between those teams and attributes an incorrect attendance figure to them.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the game involving Indiana State and Cincinnati was held on September 11, not September 10. Additionally, their attendance (30,807) is less than the only September 10 game's attendance (41,382), but the claim incorrectly states it occurred on September 10.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"visiting team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the home team win all of the game play on the day list.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this means. It seems like it's saying that every game played on a certain day (probably September 11) had the home team as the winner.\n\nLooking at the JSON table, there are multiple rows with data from different dates and times. Let me go through each row one by one to check if all home teams won on their respective days.\n\nStarting with row 0: date is \"september 10\". The result here is \"w 24 - 21 ot\", which I think means the visiting team (West Virginia) won in overtime. So, the home team didn't win this game. But since this is on September 10, not the day listed in the claim (which seems to be September 11), maybe this isn't relevant unless the claim refers to all days.\n\nWait, the claim says \"on the day list.\" The table has games from September 10 and multiple entries for September 11. So I should focus on September 11 only.\n\nLooking at row 1: date is \"september 11\", home team is Florida (No.8). Result is \"l 14 - 38\" \u2013 so the home team lost, since it's an 'L'. That means the claim isn't true because at least one home team lost.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check all rows for September 11 to see if any other home teams didn't win. \n\nRow 2: September 11, home team Cincinnati. Result is \"w 40 -7\", so they won. Good.\n\nRow3: September11, home team Connecticuit. Result \"w62-3\" \u2013 won again.\n\nRow4: September11, home team Pittsburgh. Result \"w38-16\" \u2013 win.\n\nRow5: September11, home team Louisville. Result \"w23-13\" \u2013 win.\n\nRow6: September11, home team Washington. Result is \"l20-41\". Wait, no\u2014the visiting team is Syracuse, and the result shows they lost because it's 'L' before the score. So the home team Washington won 41-20.\n\nWait a minute, I'm getting confused here. Let me re-examine row6: The result is \"l20 -41\". That would mean the visiting team Syracuse lost, so the home team Washington won with 41 points. So all September 11 games have the home teams winning except row1.\n\nBut in row1, it's \"south florida\" vs \"no8 florida\", and result is \"l14-38\". That would mean Florida (home) lost because the 'L' indicates they lost. So at least one game on September 11 where the home team didn't win. Therefore, the claim that all home teams won on that day is false.\n\nWait, but in row6: \"syracuse\" is visiting, result is \"l20-41\", which means Syracuse lost, so Washington (home) won. So only row1 had a home team loss on September 11. Thus, the claim isn't fully supported because not all home teams won.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE, and I need to list the relevant cells that show this. The relevant rows are row1 (where home team lost), and maybe others where they won, but since at least one loss exists, the answer is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"All of the game in the middle of the day have lower attendance than those play late afternoon or evening.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what this means. The claim is comparing the attendance numbers of games played during different times of the day. Specifically, it's saying that mid-day games (I assume this would be like noon to maybe 3 PM) have lower attendance compared to games in the late afternoon or evening.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details including date, time, visiting team, home team, site, broadcast, result, and attendance. The columns are: \"date\", \"time\", \"visiting team\", \"home team\", \"site\", \"broadcast\", \"result\", \"attendance\".\n\nI need to identify which games were played in the middle of the day versus late afternoon/evening. From the data:\n\n- September 10, 7:00 PM\n- September 11, 12:00 PM (there are multiple entries at this time)\n- September 11, 1:00 PM\n- September 11, 3:30 PM\n\nSo the times in the table are:\n\n- 7:00 PM (late evening)\n- 12:00 PM (mid-day, noon)\n- 12:00 PM (noon)\n- 12:00 PM (noon)\n- 1:00 PM (early afternoon)\n- 3:30 PM (late afternoon)\n- 7:00 PM (evening)\n\nNow, the claim is about games in the middle of the day compared to those in late afternoon or evening. So I need to categorize each game's time.\n\nMid-day could be considered as around noon, so let's say 12:00 PM. Late afternoon would be from maybe 3:00 PM onwards, and evening is later than that, like 7:00 PM.\n\nWait, but looking at the times:\n\n- 12:00 PM: mid-day\n- 1:00 PM: early afternoon\n- 3:30 PM: late afternoon\n- 7:00 PM: evening\n\nSo for this analysis, I think we can consider mid-day as 12:00 PM and possibly 1:00 PM as part of the afternoon. But the claim specifically mentions \"middle of the day\" versus \"late afternoon or evening.\"\n\nI'll proceed by considering any game at 12:00 PM as mid-day, and games at 3:30 PM and later (including 7:00 PM) as late afternoon/evening.\n\nNow, I need to look at each row's attendance and see if all mid-day games have lower attendance than the others. So let's list out the times and attendances:\n\n1. Row 0: September 10, 7:00 PM (evening), attendance 41382\n2. Row 1: September 11, 12:00 PM (mid-day), attendance 90612\n3. Row 2: September 11, 12:00 PM (mid-day), attendance 30807\n4. Row 3: September 11, 12:00 PM (mid-day), attendance 37359\n5. Row 4: September 11, 1:00 PM (early afternoon), attendance 50120\n6. Row 5: September 11, 3:30 PM (late afternoon), attendance 51427\n7. Row 6: September 11, 7:00 PM (evening), attendance 62418\n\nWait a minute, I see that in row 1, the mid-day game has an attendance of 90612, which is higher than some evening games like row 0's 41382 and row 5's 51427. Also, row 6 (evening) has 62418, which is less than row 1.\n\nBut the claim says \"all of the game in the middle of the day have lower attendance than those play late afternoon or evening.\" So if any mid-day game has higher attendance than a late afternoon or evening game, the claim is FALSE.\n\nLooking at row 1: 90612 (mid-day) compared to row 5's 51427 and row 6's 62418. Wait, 90612 is higher than both of those. That would mean that a mid-day game has higher attendance than some evening games, which contradicts the claim.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check:\n\nRow 1: mid-day (12 PM), attendance 90612\n\nRow 5: late afternoon (3:30 PM), attendance 51427. So row 1's attendance is higher than row 5's.\n\nSimilarly, row 6: evening (7 PM), attendance 62418, which is less than row 1's 90612.\n\nTherefore, the claim that all mid-day games have lower attendance than late afternoon/evening games is false because at least one mid-day game has higher attendance.\n\nBut wait, let me check other mid-day games:\n\nRow 1: 90612\n\nRow 2: 30807 (mid-day)\n\nRow 3: 37359 (mid-day)\n\nSo row 1's mid-day game is the highest in the table. So since it has higher attendance than some evening games, the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the claim is not true, because at least one mid-day game had higher attendance than some late afternoon/evening games.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that all mid-day games have lower attendance than late afternoon or evening games is false. Specifically, row 1 shows a mid-day game with an attendance of 90612, which exceeds the attendances of some late afternoon (row 5: 51427) and evening (row 6: 62418) games.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Game Times:**\n   - Mid-day: Games at 12:00 PM.\n   - Late Afternoon/Evening: Games at 3:30 PM and 7:00 PM.\n\n2. **List Attendances by Time Slot:**\n   - Mid-day (12:00 PM): 90612, 30807, 37359.\n   - Late Afternoon/Eve (3:30 PM & 7:00 PM): 51427, 62418.\n\n3. **Compare Attendances:**\n   - The highest mid-day attendance is 90612, which is greater than the attendances of some evening games (e.g., 62418).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe claim is false because one mid-day game had higher attendance (90612) than some late afternoon/evening games. \n\n\\boxed{\\text{False}}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"washington win against syracuse in front of 62418 fan at home\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim is saying. The key points are:\n1. Washington won against Syracuse.\n2. The attendance was 62,418 fans.\n3. This game took place at home for Washington, meaning Washington was the home team.\n\nNow, I'll look through the table to find any rows where Washington and Syracuse played each other.\n\nLooking at the data provided:\n- There are multiple entries on September 11 with different times. Each row represents a different game.\n- Scanning through, the last entry (row index 6) has the visiting team as \"syracuse\" and the home team as \"washington.\" That seems relevant.\n\nNext, I'll check the result column for this row. The result is listed as \"l 20 - 41.\" Since it starts with 'l', that likely means loss for the visiting team, which is Syracuse here. So Washington won because they are the home team and the result indicates a win for them.\n\nNow, checking the attendance for this game: It's listed as 62,418. The claim mentions 62418 fans, so that matches exactly.\n\nLastly, confirming whether Washington was at home. In the row, \"washington\" is under the \"home team\" column, so yes, they were playing at home.\n\nAll parts of the claim are supported by this specific row in the table. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"visiting team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
