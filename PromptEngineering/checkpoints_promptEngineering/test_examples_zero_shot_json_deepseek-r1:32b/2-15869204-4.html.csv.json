    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the raptor finish the month of november with a 6 - 8 record\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns include \"record,\" which seems relevant since the claim is about their final record. Each row represents a game, and there are multiple games listed from November 1 to November 29.\n\nThe claim states that the Raptors ended November with a 6-8 record. That means they should have won 6 games and lost 8 in total during the month.\n\nLooking through each row's \"record\" column:\n- Row 3: Record is 2-1 (after game 3)\n- Row 4: 3-1\n- Row 5: 3-2\n- Row 6: 4-2\n- Row 7: 4-3\n- Row 8: 4-4\n- Row 9: 4-5\n- Row 10: 5-5\n- Row 11: 5-6\n- Row 12: 6-6 (after game 12)\n- Row 13: 6-7\n- Row 14: 7-7\n- Row 15: 8-7\n- Row 16: 8-8\n\nThe last row is November 29, which shows the record as 8-8. That means by the end of November, they had 8 wins and 8 losses.\n\nWait a second, but the claim says 6-8. So according to the table, their final record was 8-8, not 6-8. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe Raptors ended November with an 8-8 record, so the claim of finishing at 6-8 is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the most point score by the raptor in a game be 101\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It's stating that the highest points scored by the Raptors in any single game was 101.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several columns: \"game,\" \"date,\" \"team,\" \"score,\" and others like \"high points.\" The \"score\" column seems to show the outcome of each game, including both teams' scores. For example, row 3 shows a loss with a score of 56-73 (OT), which I assume means the team scored 56 points.\n\nTo find out if there was a game where the Raptors scored 101 points, I'll go through each row and check the \"score\" column. \n\nRow 0: Score is L 56-73 (OT) \u2192 The team scored 56.\nRow 1: W 77-71 (OT) \u2192 Team scored 77.\nRow 2: L 60-86 (OT) \u2192 60 points.\nRow 3: W 89-76 (OT) \u2192 89 points.\nRow 4: L 80-83 (OT) \u2192 80 points.\nRow 5: L 79-94 (OT) \u2192 79 points.\nRow 6: L 64-94 (OT) \u2192 64 points.\nRow 7: W 101-97 (2OT) \u2192 Here, the score is a win with 101 points. This seems to be the highest so far and exactly matches the claim.\n\nRows beyond row 7 also have scores like 75, 81, etc., but none reach 101 again. \n\nSo, based on this, the claim that the most points scored by the Raptors in a game was 101 is supported by row 7 where they scored exactly 101.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that in game number 15 (row index 7), the Raptors scored 101 points, which is the highest score listed.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The table has several columns: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, location attendance, and record. The relevant column here is \"location attendance\" because that's where the attendance numbers are listed for each game.\n\nMy task is to find the lowest attendance figure in this column across all games. I'll go through each row and extract the attendance number, then compare them to see which one is the smallest.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Row 0: \"target center 15869\" \u2192 15869\n- Row 1: \"air canada centre 17556\" \u2192 17556\n- Row 2: \"mci center 20173\" \u2192 20173\n- Row 3: \"air canada centre 16888\" \u2192 16888\n- Row 4: \"rose garden 14082\" \u2192 14082\n- Row 5: \"staples center 18997\" \u2192 18997\n- Row 6: \"arco arena 17317\" \u2192 17317\n- Row 7: \"air canada centre 19547\" \u2192 19547\n- Row 8: \"air canada centre 19800\" \u2192 19800\n- Row 9: \"continental airlines arena 13755\" \u2192 13755\n- Row 10: \"air canada centre 17702\" \u2192 17702\n- Row 11: \"philips arena 11730\" \u2192 11730\n- Row 12: \"td waterhouse centre 13375\" \u2192 13375\n- Row 13: \"american airlines arena 14585\" \u2192 14585\n\nNow, I'll list all the attendance numbers:\n\n15869, 17556, 20173, 16888, 14082, 18997, 17317, 19547, 19800, 13755, 17702, 11730, 13375, 14585.\n\nLooking for the smallest number here. The lowest I see is 11730 in row 11. Is there any number lower than that? Let me double-check:\n\n- Row 4: 14082 (higher than 11730)\n- Row 9: 13755 (also higher)\n- Row 12: 13375 (still higher)\n\nYes, 11730 is indeed the smallest attendance number.

If it's Vince Carter, that counts towards the 12.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nGame 3: High points is \"vince carter (15)\" \u2192 Vince leads.\nGame 4: \"vince carter (19)\" \u2192 Yes.\nGame 5: \"vince carter (18)\" \u2192 Yes.\nGame 6: \"vince carter (34)\" \u2192 Yes.\nGame 7: \"vince carter (33)\" \u2192 Yes.\nGame 8: \"vince carter (23)\" \u2192 Yes.\nGame 9: \"vince carter , lamond murray (13)\" \u2192 Here, both have the same points. So Vince is tied, but does that count as leading? Hmm, maybe not, because it's a tie. So this might be one where he didn't lead alone.\nWait, in Game 9, it says \"vince carter , lamond murray (13)\". I think the format is player(s) and their points in parentheses. So both have 13 each. Therefore, Vince didn't lead alone; they tied.\n\nGame 10: \"chris bosh (25)\" \u2192 Chris led.\nGame 11: \"vince carter (20)\" \u2192 Vince leads.\nGame 12: \"vince carter (21)\" \u2192 Yes.\nGame 13: \"vince carter (15)\" \u2192 Yes.\nGame 14: \"vince carter (43)\" \u2192 Yes.\nGame 15: \"vince carter (20)\" \u2192 Yes.\nGame 16: \"lamond murray (14)\" \u2192 Lamond led.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nTotal games in the table are from game 3 to game 16.

But the claim says 12 out of 14.\n\nHmm, did I miss any? Let me check each game again:\n\nGame 3: Yes (1)\nGame 4: Yes (2)\nGame 5: Yes (3)\nGame 6: Yes (4)\nGame 7: Yes (5)\nGame 8: Yes (6)\nGame 9: Tied \u2192 Not counted\nGame 10: No\nGame 11: Yes (7)\nGame 12: Yes (8)\nGame 13: Yes (9)\nGame 14: Yes (10)\nGame 15: Yes (11)\nGame 16: No\n\nSo that's 11 games where Vince led. So the claim says 12, but according to this, it's only 11.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me go through each game again:\n\nRow indices are from 0 (game 3) to 13 (game 16). Wait no: looking back, the table has rows from 0 to 15, but the games are numbered from 3 to 16? Or is it that the first row is game number 3?\n\nWait, in the data, each row represents a game with numbers starting at 3 up to 16. So total of 14 games (since 16-3+1=14). Correct.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 0: Game 3 \u2192 Vince\nRow 1: Game 4 \u2192 Vince\nRow 2: Game5 \u2192 Vince\nRow3: Game6 \u2192Vince\nRow4: Game7\u2192Vince\nRow5: Game8\u2192Vince\nRow6: Game9\u2192Tied (so not counted)\nRow7: Game10\u2192Chris\nRow8: Game11\u2192Vince\nRow9: Game12\u2192Vince\nRow10:Game13\u2192Vince\nRow11:Game14\u2192Vince\nRow12:Game15\u2192Vince\nRow13:Game16\u2192Lamond\n\nSo counting:\n\nRows 0-5 (games 3-8): all Vince \u2192 6 games.\n\nThen row7 is game10, which is Chris. So not counted.\n\nRow6 is Game9, tied.\n\nFrom row8 to row12: that's rows 8,9,10,11,12: games 11-15.

So total Vince led in 11 games, not 12. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I miscounted somewhere else? Let me check again:\n\nList of rows and whether Vince led:\n\n0: yes\n1: yes\n2: yes\n3: yes\n4: yes\n5: yes \u2192 that's 6\n\nThen row6: Game9\u2192Tied \u2192 no\nrow7: game10\u2192Chris\u2192no\nrow8:game11\u2192Vince\u2192yes (7)\nrow9:game12\u2192Vince\u2192yes (8)\nrow10:game13\u2192Vince\u2192yes (9)\nrow11:game14\u2192Vince\u2192yes (10)\nrow12:game15\u2192Vince\u2192yes (11)\nrow13:game16\u2192Lamond\u2192no\n\nYes, total 11.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect.

Still not Vince.\n- **Game 7**: Antonio Davis with 11. Not him.\n- **Game 8**: Multiple players (Chris Bosh, Antonio Davis, Jerome Williams) each have 8 rebounds.

But since the claim says he led, I think this counts because he was among those leading, even if it's a tie.\nWait, actually, in Game 12, multiple players have the same rebounds, so Vince didn't lead alone. The claim might mean leading by himself, so perhaps this doesn't count. Or does it? Hmm, maybe not.\n\n- **Game 13**: High rebounds are Antonio Davis and Jerome Williams with 9 each.

So, my task is to check each game's score in the table and see if there's a game where the Raptors scored exactly 99 points.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see that it has columns like \"game\", \"date\", \"team\", \"score\", etc. The relevant column for this claim seems to be the \"score\" column because it shows the points each team scored in that game.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row of data and examine the \"score\" field:\n\n1. Game 3: Score is \"l 56 - 73 (ot)\". So, the Raptors lost this game with a score of 56.\n2. Game 4: Score is \"w 77 - 71 (ot)\". The Raptor's score here was 77.\n3. Game 5: Score is \"l 60 - 86 (ot)\". They scored 60, lost the game.\n4. Game 6: Score is \"w 89 - 76 (ot)\". Here, they won with 89 points.\n5. Game 7: Score is \"l 80 - 83 (ot)\". They scored 80 and lost in overtime.\n6. Game 8: Score is \"l 79 - 94 (ot)\". The Raptor's score was 79, another loss.\n7. Game 9: Score is \"l 64 - 94 (ot)\". This game they scored only 64.\n8. Game 10: Score is \"w 101 - 97 (2ot)\". Wait a minute, here the score is 101 for the Raptors. That's higher than 99 and it's a win in double overtime.\n9. Game 11: Score is \"l 87 - 86\". They scored 87 but lost by one point.\n10. Game 12: Score is \"w 99 - 97 (ot)\". Okay, here they scored 99 and won in overtime.\n\nSo, from this, I can see two games where the Raptors scored above 99 points:\n\n- In Game 10, they scored 101.\n- In Game 12, they scored exactly 99.\n\nTherefore, the claim says \"the most point score by the raptor in a game be 99,\" but according to the table, their highest was actually 101. So the claim is incorrect because there's a higher score than 99 in another game. \n\nWait, but let me double-check Game 10. The score was \"w 101 - 97 (2ot)\". That definitely means they scored 101 points, which is more than 99. So the highest isn't 99; it's actually higher. Therefore, the claim is false because there's a game where they scored more.\n\nI think I should list all the relevant cells that have scores over 99 to support this conclusion. In Game 10 and Game 12, their points were 101 and 99 respectively. So both these rows in the \"score\" column are important because they show the highest and a close one.\n\nSo, putting it all together, since there's at least one game where they scored more than 99 (101), the claim that the maximum is 99 isn't correct. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the highest points scored by the Raptors in a game was 99. However, examining each game's score reveals two games where they scored higher: 101 and 99. Since 101 is greater than 99, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the JSON data provided. It has columns and data. The columns are: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, location attendance, record. Each row corresponds to a specific game with details filled under these columns.\n\nThe claim is about the highest attendance being 19800. So, I need to examine the \"location attendance\" column across all rows to find the maximum value and check if it's 19800.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: \"target center 15869\"\nRow 1: \"air canada centre 17556\"\nRow 2: \"mci center 20173\" \u2192 This is higher than 19800.\nRow 3: \"air canada centre 16888\"\nRow 4: \"rose garden 14082\"\nRow 5: \"staples center 18997\"\nRow 6: \"arco arena 17317\"\nRow 7: \"air canada centre 19547\" \u2192 Close to 19800 but still less.\nRow 8: \"air canada centre 19800\" \u2192 This matches the claim.\nRow 9: \"continental airlines arena 13755\"\nRow 10: \"air canada centre 17702\"\nRow 11: \"philips arena 11730\"\nRow 12: \"td waterhouse centre 13375\"\nRow 13: \"american airlines arena 14585\"\n\nWait, in row 2, the attendance is 20173, which is higher than 19800. So that would be the highest, making the claim FALSE because the highest isn't 19800 but actually 20173.\n\nTherefore, I need to check all rows for \"location attendance\" values. The maximum value found is 20173 in row 2 (index starts at 0), so the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe highest attendance is 20173, which is higher than 19800.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the highest rebound total for a player in 1 game be 13\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the JSON data provided. The table has several columns: \"game\", \"date\", \"team\", \"score\", \"high points\", \"high rebounds\", \"location attendance\", and \"record\". Each row in the data corresponds to a game with various details filled in these columns.\n\nThe claim is about the highest rebound total for a player in a single game. So, I should focus on the \"high rebounds\" column because that's where the rebound statistics are listed.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: \"jerome williams (16)\" \u2013 Wait, this is under \"high rebounds\". That's higher than 13.\nRow 1: \"antonio davis (12)\" \u2013 Lower than 13.\nRow 2: \"jerome williams (13)\" \u2013 Exactly 13.\nRow 3: \"jerome williams (13)\" again.\nRow 4: \"antonio davis (11)\" \u2013 Less than 13.\nRow 5: There are three players listed with rebounds of 8 each. So, none here exceed or reach 13.\nRow 6: \"antonio davis (10)\" \u2013 Still less than 13.\nRow 7: This one is a bit more complex because it's a double overtime game, but the rebound total here is 11, which is below 13.\nRow 8: The high rebounds are listed as multiple players with 9 each. So again, below 13.\nRow 9: \"jerome williams (6)\" \u2013 Even lower.\nRow 10: \"antonio davis (9)\" \u2013 Still under 13.\nRow 11: Here, it's a bit tricky because three players have rebounds of 6 each. So nothing close to 13.\nRow 12: The high rebounds are split between two players with 9 each.\nRow 13: \"antonio davis (11)\" \u2013 Below 13.\nRow 14: Two players sharing the rebounds with 8 each. No, still below 13.\nRow 15: \"chris bosh (10)\" \u2013 Less than 13.\n\nWait a minute, but in Row 0, the high rebounds are 16. That's higher than 13, so that would mean the claim is incorrect because someone had more rebounds in a single game. However, I might have made a mistake here because earlier rows seem to contradict this.\n\nLet me double-check each row again:\n\nLooking back at Row 0: \"jerome williams (16)\" \u2013 That's definitely higher than 13. So if the claim is that the highest is 13, then this would make the claim FALSE because there's a game where someone had 16 rebounds.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made an error in reading the rows correctly. Let me list all the rebound totals from each row:\n\nRow 0: 16\nRow 1: 12\nRow 2: 13\nRow 3: 13\nRow 4: 11\nRow 5: 8\nRow 6: 10\nRow 7: 11\nRow 8: 9\nRow 9: 6\nRow 10: 9\nRow 11: 6\nRow 12: 9\nRow 13: 11\nRow 14: 8\nRow 15: 10\n\nFrom this, the highest rebound total in a single game is indeed 16 in Row 0. Therefore, the claim that the highest is 13 is incorrect because there's a higher value.\n\nWait, but I might have misread which column \"high rebounds\" is in. Let me confirm: the columns are \"game\", \"date\", \"team\", \"score\", \"high points\", \"high rebounds\", etc. So yes, each row under \"high rebounds\" gives the top rebounder(s) and their totals.\n\nSo since there's a game where someone had 16 rebounds, which is higher than 13, the claim that the highest was 13 is FALSE. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells would include the row with 16 rebounds as well as any rows showing 13 to confirm.\n\nWait no, actually, if someone had a higher rebound total than 13, then the maximum isn't 13; it's at least 16. So the claim is false because there exists a game where a player had more rebounds than 13.\n</think>\n\nThe highest rebound total in any game was 16, which occurs in row 0 under \"high rebounds\". Therefore, the claim that the highest was 13 is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
