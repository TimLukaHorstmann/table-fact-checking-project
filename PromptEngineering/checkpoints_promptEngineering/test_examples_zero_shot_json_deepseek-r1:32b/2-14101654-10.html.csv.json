    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"except for slovakia , all other country be from north america\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that every nationality in the table should be a North American country, except for Slovakia. So, my task is to check each row in the table and see if any nationality besides Slovakia is not from North America.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each player's nationality one by one:\n\n1. Rob Bellamy: United States - this is definitely a North American country.\n2. R J Anderson: United States - same as above.\n3. David Laliberte: Canada - another North American country.\n4. Chris Zarb: United States - yes, North America.\n5. Gino Pisellini: United States - same here.\n6. Ladislav Scurko: Slovakia - this is the exception mentioned in the claim.\n7. Frederik Cabana: Canada - North American.\n8. Martin Houle: Canada - again, North America.\n9. Travis Gawryletz: Canada - yes.\n10. Triston Grant: Canada - same as others.\n11. John Carter: United States - yes.\n\nSo, after checking each row, all nationalities except for Slovakia are from the United States or Canada, which are both in North America. That means the claim is correct because there's only one exception (Slovakia), and all other countries fit the condition specified.\n\nI need to make sure I didn't miss any other nationality that might not be North American. Looking back, none of the other entries have nationalities outside of Canada or the United States except for Slovakia. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"no 2 players attend the same college / junior / club team (league)\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that no two players share the same team in their respective leagues. So, each player must be attending a unique team; there should be no duplicates across the \"college / junior / club team (league)\" column.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several rows with information about different players, including their team and league. My task is to check if any two players have the same team in this specific column.\n\nLet me list out each player's team as per the data:\n\n1. Rob Bellamy: New England Jr Coyotes (EJHL)\n2. R J Anderson: Centennial High School (Minn)\n3. David Laliberte: Prince Edward Island Rocket (QMJHL)\n4. Chris Zarb: Tri-City Storm (USHL)\n5. Gino Pisellini: Plymouth Whalers (OHL)\n6. Ladislav Scurko: Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Nov\u00e1 Ves (Slovakia)\n7. Frederik Cabana: Halifax Mooseheads (QMJHL)\n8. Martin Houle: Cape Breton Screaming Eagles (QMJHL)\n9. Travis Gawryletz: Trail Smoke Eaters (BCHL)\n10. Triston Grant: Vancouver Giants (WHL)\n11. John Carter: Brewster Bulldogs (EMJHL)\n\nNow, I need to check for duplicates in the team names.\n\nLooking at each one:\n\n- New England Jr Coyotes appears once.\n- Centennial High School is unique.\n- Prince Edward Island Rocket is listed once.\n- Tri-City Storm only once.\n- Plymouth Whalers is singular.\n- Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Nov\u00e1 Ves is a unique entry from Slovakia.\n- Halifax Mooseheads: Now, looking here, I see that both Frederik Cabana (row 6) and Martin Houle (row 8) are associated with the QMJHL. Specifically, their team is listed as \"halifax mooseheads\" for both. Wait, no\u2014looking again, actually:\n\nWait a minute, let me check rows 6 and 7.\n\nRow 6: Ladislav Scurko's team is \"spi\u0161sk\u00e1 nov\u00e1 ves (slovakia)\" \u2014 that's unique.\n\nRow 7: Frederik Cabana is from Halifax Mooseheads (QMJHL). \n\nRow 8: Martin Houle is also in the QMJHL, with team Cape Breton Screaming Eagles. So no, they're different teams within the same league. So each team is unique even if they are in the same league.\n\nWait, but looking at row 6 and 7 again:\n\nRow 6 (index starting at 0): Ladislav Scurko \u2014 Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Nov\u00e1 Ves (slovakia)\nRow 7: Frederik Cabana \u2014 Halifax Mooseheads (QMJHL)\nRow 8: Martin Houle \u2014 Cape Breton Screaming Eagles (QMJHL)\n\nWait, no duplicates there. Each team is unique.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me list all the teams again:\n\n1. New England Jr Coyotes\n2. Centennial High School\n3. Prince Edward Island Rocket\n4. Tri-City Storm\n5. Plymouth Whalers\n6. Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Nov\u00e1 Ves\n7. Halifax Mooseheads\n8. Cape Breton Screaming Eagles\n9. Trail Smoke Eaters\n10. Vancouver Giants\n11. Brewster Bulldogs\n\nEach of these team names appears only once in the \"college / junior / club team (league)\" column. So, no two players share the same team.\n\nWait, but let me double-check for any possible duplicates I might have missed. Maybe some teams are listed differently but refer to the same entity? For example, is there a chance that two entries are actually the same team?\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- All team names seem distinct. There's no repetition in the team names themselves across the rows.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim that \"no 2 players attend the same college / junior / club team (league)\" is TRUE. \n\nTo be thorough, I'll cross-reference each row to ensure there are no duplicates:\n\n- Row 0: New England Jr Coyotes \u2014 unique\n- Row 1: Centennial High School \u2014 unique\n- Row 2: Prince Edward Island Rocket \u2014 unique\n- Row 3: Tri-City Storm \u2014 unique\n- Row 4: Plymouth Whalers \u2014 unique\n- Row 5: Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Nov\u00e1 Ves \u2014 unique\n- Row 6: Halifax Mooseheads \u2014 unique\n- Row 7: Cape Breton Screaming Eagles \u2014 unique\n- Row 8: Trail Smoke Eaters \u2014 unique\n- Row 9: Vancouver Giants \u2014 unique\n- Row 10: Brewster Bulldogs \u2014 unique\n\nNo duplicates found. Therefore, the answer is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"5 players be from the united state and canada each\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are \"round\", \"player\", \"position\", \"nationality\", and \"college / junior / club team (league)\". Each row represents a player with their details in these categories.\n\nThe claim is saying that there are 5 players from the United States and 5 from Canada each. Wait, actually, reading it again: \"5 player be from the united state and canada each\". Hmm, maybe it's interpreted as 5 players total, 2.5 each? But that doesn't make sense since you can't have half a person. Alternatively, perhaps it means 5 players in total, with some split between US and Canada. Wait, but the wording is unclear. Maybe it's trying to say that there are 5 players from the US and 5 from Canada each\u2014so total of 10? Let me check the data.\n\nLooking at the \"nationality\" column:\n\n- Row 0: United States\n- Row 1: United States\n- Row 2: Canada\n- Row 3: United States\n- Row 4: United States\n- Row 5: Slovakia\n- Row 6: Canada\n- Row 7: Canada\n- Row 8: Canada\n- Row 9: Canada\n- Row 10: United States\n\nCounting US nationalities:\nRows 0,1,3,4,10 \u2192 that's 5 players from the US.\n\nCanada nationalities:\nRows 2,6,7,8,9 \u2192 also 5 players from Canada.\n\nWait, but row 5 is Slovakia. So total of 5 US and 5 Canada each? Let me count again:\n\nUS: Rows 0 (Bellamy), 1 (Anderson), 3 (Zarb),4 (Pisellini),10 (Carter) \u2192 that's 5.\n\nCanada: Rows 2 (Laliberte),6 (Cabana),7 (Houle),8 (Gawryletz),9 (Grant) \u2192 that's also 5. \n\nWait, but looking at the data, there are 11 rows. Let me recount to ensure I didn't miss any:\n\nUS: 0,1,3,4,10 \u2192 yes, five.\n\nCanada: 2,6,7,8,9 \u2192 five as well. So total of 5 from each country. But the claim says \"5 player be from the united state and canada each\". Wait, maybe it's a typo and meant to say 5 players in total? Or perhaps that there are 5 US and 5 Canada each?\n\nWait, the exact wording is: \"5 player be from the united state and canada each\". Hmm. Maybe it's saying that five players are from both the US and Canada each? That would imply ten players. But we only have 11 in total. Alternatively, maybe it's meant to say that there are five players in total, with some split between US and Canada.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again: The claim says \"5 player be from the united state and canada each\". Maybe it means 5 players in total, with some from each country? But looking at the data, there are more than five players, so that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is trying to say that exactly five players are from the US and exactly five from Canada. Looking at the counts: yes, 5 US and 5 Canada. So total of ten players (since rows 0-10 are 11 entries, but row 5 is Slovakia). Wait no, rows 0-10 are 11 players. So perhaps there's a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nUS: rows 0,1,3,4,10 \u2192 that's five.\n\nCanada: rows 2,6,7,8,9 \u2192 that's five.\n\nSo total of ten players from US and Canada, with one player from Slovakia (row 5). So the claim says \"5 player be from the united state and canada each\". Maybe it means 5 each? That would be 10 in total. The table has 10 such players plus one from Slovakia, making 11.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me read the claim again: \"5 player be from the united state and canada each\". It could mean that there are five players from each country, US and Canada, which would make ten players in total. But our table has 10 players (rows 0-9) except row 10 is also US, so actually, rows 0-10: 11 players.\n\nWait no, let me count the nationalities:\n\nRow 0: US\n\nRow1: US\n\nRow2: Canada\n\nRow3: US\n\nRow4: US\n\nRow5: Slovakia\n\nRow6: Canada\n\nRow7: Canada\n\nRow8: Canada\n\nRow9: Canada\n\nRow10: US\n\nSo, in total, how many from each:\n\nUS: rows 0,1,3,4,10 \u2192 five.\n\nCanada: rows2,6,7,8,9 \u2192 five.\n\nSlovakia: row5 \u2192 one.\n\nTotal players: 11. So the claim is \"5 player be from the united state and canada each\". If it's saying that there are five players from US and five from Canada each (i.e., ten in total), but our table has five from US, five from Canada, and one from Slovakia, making eleven. Wait, perhaps the claim is incorrect because there are actually six US nationalities? Let me check again:\n\nRow0: US\n\nRow1: US\n\nRow2: Canada\n\nRow3: US\n\nRow4: US\n\nRow5:Slovakia\n\nRow6:Canada\n\nRow7:Canada\n\nRow8:Canada\n\nRow9:Canada\n\nRow10:US\n\nSo, US nationalities are rows 0,1,3,4,10 \u2192 five.\n\nYes, five from each. So the claim is correct in that there are five players from US and five from Canada each, making ten players, plus one from Slovakia. But wait, the table has eleven players. Wait no, I think I made a mistake: rows 0-10 are eleven entries, but the counts are:\n\nUS:5\n\nCanada:5\n\nSlovakia:1\n\nTotal:11.\n\nSo if the claim is that there are five from US and five from Canada each (total ten), then it's correct. The remaining one is Slovakia. So perhaps the claim is referring to those ten players, meaning excluding Slovakia? Or maybe including all eleven?\n\nBut regardless, according to the counts, we have exactly five from each country. Therefore, the answer would be yes, there are five players from US and five from Canada.\n</think>\n\nYes, there are exactly five players from the United States and five from Canada in the given data.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify Nationalities**: Examine each row's nationality column.\n2. **Count US Nationalities**:\n   - Row 0: United States\n   - Row 1: United States\n   - Row 3: United States\n   - Row 4: United States\n   - Row 10: United States\n   Total: 5 players from the US.\n3. **Count Canada Nationalities**:\n   - Row 2: Canada\n   - Row 6: Canada\n   - Row 7: Canada\n   - Row 8: Canada\n   - Row 9: Canada\n   Total: 5 players from Canada.\n4. **Conclusion**: There are five players each from the United States and Canada, fulfilling the claim.\n\nAnswer: Yes, there are five players from the United States and five from Canada in the data provided.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"only round 3 be not list 2 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the JSON data to understand the structure of the table. The columns are: \"round\", \"player\", \"position\", \"nationality\", and \"college / junior / club team (league)\". There are 11 rows of data provided.\n\nThe claim seems a bit unclear at first glance, but I interpret it as saying that only round 3 appears exactly once in the table. The user is checking if there's any repetition of the round number beyond what's stated. Specifically, they're asking whether round 3 is listed only once and no other rounds are listed twice.\n\nLooking at the \"round\" column:\n\n- Round 3: Row 0\n- Round 4: Rows 1, 2\n- Round 5: Rows 3, 4\n- Round 6: Rows 5, 6\n- Round 8: Rows 7, 8\n- Round 9: Rows 9, 10\n\nFrom this, I can see that round 3 appears once. However, the other rounds (4, 5, 6, 8, 9) all appear more than once in the table.\n\nThe claim states that only round 3 is listed once and no other rounds are listed twice. But according to the data, this isn't true because every other round after 3 is listed at least two times. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nTo verify this, I'll list out each relevant cell where the \"round\" column has a value beyond 3. Each of these entries supports that rounds beyond 3 are indeed listed multiple times.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that only round 3 appears once and all other rounds do not appear twice. However, the data shows that rounds after 3 (4,5,6,8,9) each appear at least twice.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns in the table: round, player, position, nationality, and college/junior/club team (league). The claim is about a player named Triston Grant being the only left wing listed. So, I should focus on the \"position\" column to find all players who are left wings.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Rob Bellamy - position is right wing.\n- Row 1: R J Anderson - defense.\n- Row 2: David Laliberte - right wing.\n- Row 3: Chris Zarb - defense.\n- Row 4: Gino Pisellini - right wing.\n- Row 5: Ladislav Scurko - center.\n- Row 6: Frederik Cabana - center.\n- Row 7: Martin Houle - goaltender.\n- Row 8: Travis Gawryletz - defense.\n- Row 9: Triston Grant - left wing.\n- Row 10: John Carter - center.\n\nFrom this, only row 9 has the position as \"left wing,\" which is Triston Grant. There are no other entries with that position. So, the claim is TRUE because he is indeed the sole left wing in the list.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells for this conclusion. I need to check each player's position. Therefore, each row's \"position\" column must be examined.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"the number of players from Canada outnumber the number of players from the United States.\" I need to determine if this is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns for round, player, position, nationality, and college/junior/club team (league). The relevant information here is under the \"nationality\" column because that's where we can find out how many players are from Canada versus the United States.\n\nNow, let me go through each row in the data to count the nationalities.\n\n1. Row 0: Rob Bellamy, Nationality - United States\n2. Row 1: R J Anderson, Nationality - United States\n3. Row 2: David Laliberte, Nationality - Canada\n4. Row 3: Chris Zarb, Nationality - United States\n5. Row 4: Gino Pisellini, Nationality - United States\n6. Row 5: Ladislav Scurko, Nationality - Slovakia (Not relevant for this claim)\n7. Row 6: Frederik Cabana, Nationality - Canada\n8. Row 7: Martin Houle, Nationality - Canada\n9. Row 8: Travis Gawryletz, Nationality - Canada\n10. Row 9: Triston Grant, Nationality - Canada\n11. Row 10: John Carter, Nationality - United States\n\nNow, counting the nationalities:\n\n- Canada:\n  - Row 2: David Laliberte\n  - Row 6: Frederik Cabana\n  - Row 7: Martin Houle\n  - Row 8: Travis Gawryletz\n  - Row 9: Triston Grant\n  That's a total of 5 players from Canada.\n\n- United States:\n  - Row 0: Rob Bellamy\n  - Row 1: R J Anderson\n  - Row 3: Chris Zarb\n  - Row 4: Gino Pisellini\n  - Row 10: John Carter\n  That's also a total of 5 players from the United States.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me recount to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nLooking again:\n\nCanada:\n- Row 2: Yes (David)\n- Row 6: Frederik (yes)\n- Row 7: Martin\n- Row 8: Travis\n- Row 9: Triston\nTotal: 5\n\nUnited States:\n- Row 0: Rob\n- Row 1: R J Anderson\n- Row 3: Chris\n- Row 4: Gino\n- Row 10: John\nThat's also 5.\n\nSo, both countries have the same number of players (5 each). Therefore, the claim that Canada has more players than the United States is FALSE. They are equal in number.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Canadian players outnumber those from the United States. Upon reviewing each row, both nationalities have exactly five players each.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"every player comes from either a college program or a junior / club team\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: round, player, position, nationality, and college/junior/club team (league). Each row represents a player with their respective details.\n\nThe claim is that every player comes from either a college program or a junior/club team. So, for each player, I need to check the 'college / junior / club team (league)' column to see if it's classified as a college program or a junior/club team.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Rob Bellamy - His team is listed as \"new england jr coyotes (ejhl)\". The term 'jr' here stands for junior, so this fits the junior category.\n2. **Row 1**: R J Anderson - Team is \"centennial high school (minn)\". High school isn't a college or junior/club team; it's a secondary education institution. So this might be an issue because the claim specifies either college or junior/club teams, not high schools.\n3. **Row 2**: David Laliberte - His team is \"prince edward island rocket (qmjhl)\", which is a junior league, so that fits.\n4. **Row 3**: Chris Zarb - Team is \"tri-city storm (ushl)\". USHL is a junior league, so this is fine.\n5. **Row 4**: Gino Pisellini - His team is \"plymouth whalers (ohl)\", another junior league.\n6. **Row 5**: Ladislav Scurko - Team is listed as \"Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Nov\u00e1 Ves (slovakia)\". There's no mention of college or junior here, just the club name and country. This could be a problem because it doesn't specify if it's a college program or a junior/club team.\n7. **Row 6**: Frederik Cabana - Team is \"halifax mooseheads (qmjhl)\", which is a junior league.\n8. **Row 7**: Martin Houle - His team is \"cape breton screaming eagles (qmjhl)\", another junior team.\n9. **Row 8**: Travis Gawryletz - Team is \"trail smoke eaters (bchl)\", Banting Cherry Hockey League, which is a junior league.\n10. **Row 9**: Triston Grant - Team is \"vancouver giants (whl)\", WHL is a major junior league in Canada.\n11. **Row 10**: John Carter - Team is \"brewster bulldogs (emjhl)\". EMJHL stands for Eastern Massachusetts Junior Hockey League, which is a junior league.\n\nWait, I noticed that row 1 and row 5 might be problematic. Row 1's player comes from a high school, not a college or junior team as per the claim. Similarly, row 5's team doesn't specify if it's a college or junior program; just the club name and country.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, not all players come from either a college program or a junior/club team. Some are from high schools (like R J Anderson) or don't have a specified category beyond their country and team name (Ladislav Scurko). Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"college  / junior  / club team  (league)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"college  / junior  / club team  (league)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"2 players be draft in each round round 3 and 9.\" I need to check if there are exactly two players drafted in both round 3 and round 9.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the 'round' column in the table.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"Triston Grant plays the same position as the other player drafted in his round.\" \n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by identifying Triston Grant's details. From the data provided, Triston Grant is listed in row 9 (index starting from 0) with the following information:\n\n- Round: 9\n- Position: Left Wing\n\nNow, the claim mentions \"the other player drafted in his round.\" So, I need to check if there are any other players in round 9 besides Triston Grant. Scanning through the data, I see that row 10 is also in round 9:\n\n- Player: John Carter\n- Position: Center\n\nSo, in round 9, there are two players: Triston Grant (Left Wing) and John Carter (Center). \n\nThe claim says that Triston plays the same position as \"the other player\" in his round. That would mean we're comparing Triston's position to John Carter's. Since Triston is a Left Wing and John is a Center, their positions are different.\n\nWait, but does this mean there are two players in round 9? Let me double-check the data:\n\n- Row 8: Martin Houle (Round 8)\n- Row 9: Travis Gawryletz (Round 8 as well?)\nWait, no. Looking back, row indices start from 0. So row 10 is actually the last entry with round 9. Let me recount:\n\nRows:\n0: Round 3\n1: Round 4\n2: Round 4\n3: Round 5\n4: Round 5\n5: Round 6\n6: Round 6\n7: Round 8\n8: Round 8\n9: Round 9 (Triston Grant)\n10: Round 9 (John Carter)\n\nSo in round 9, there are two players. Now, checking their positions:\n\n- Triston Grant: Left Wing\n- John Carter: Center\n\nThey have different positions. Therefore, the claim that Triston plays the same position as the other player in his round is false.\n\nWait a minute\u2014is that all? Let me make sure I didn't miss any other players in round 9. From the data provided, only rows 9 and 10 are in round 9. Both have different positions. So yes, there's no one else with the same position as Triston in that round.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Triston Grant plays the same position as another player drafted in his round (round 9).
