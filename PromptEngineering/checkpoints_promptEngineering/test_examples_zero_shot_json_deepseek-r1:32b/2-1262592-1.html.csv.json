    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"ensign race field a f1 car for 10 year , from 1973 through 1982\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It states that Ensign raced an F1 car over a span of 10 years, specifically from 1973 to 1982. So I need to check if there are entries for each year in this range and whether they fielded F1 cars.\n\nLooking at the table's data:\n\n- The \"year\" column ranges from 1973 to 1982, which covers exactly 10 years.\n- Each row represents a different year within that range. For example, 1973 is row 0 and 1982 is row 9.\n\nNow, I need to confirm if each of these entries corresponds to an F1 car. The \"chassis\" column lists models like Ensign N173, N174, etc., which are known F1 chassis used by the team during those years. Additionally, all entries use a Ford V8 engine, which was typical for F1 cars of that era.\n\nTherefore, each year from 1973 to 1982 has an entry indicating that Ensign did field F1 cars during those years. This supports the claim fully.\n\nThe relevant cells are all the \"year\" entries from row indices 0 through 9, as each represents a consecutive year in the claimed period.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"ensign race stick exclusively to ford v8 engine , but change tire manufacturer several time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break down the claim into two parts and check each against the data.\n\nFirst, the claim states that Ensign Race Stick exclusively used the Ford V8 engine. Looking at the \"engine (s)\" column in the table, I see that every row has \"ford v8\" as the engine type. So, they didn't use any other engines besides Ford V8 across all years from 1973 to 1982. That part checks out.\n\nNext, the claim mentions that they changed tire manufacturers several times. The tires are listed in the \"tyres\" column. Let me go through each year's tyre type:\n\n- 1973: \"f\"\n- 1974: \"f\"\n- 1975: \"g\"\n- 1976: \"g\"\n- 1977: \"g\"\n- 1978: \"g\"\n- 1979: \"g\"\n- 1980: \"g\"\n- 1981: \"m a\" (which seems like multiple tyre types or brands)\n- 1982: \"p\"\n\nSo, the tyre manufacturers change over the years from 'f' to 'g', then in 1981 they have 'm a', and in 1982 it's 'p'. That indicates several changes in tyre manufacturers. Therefore, the second part of the claim is also true.\n\nBoth conditions are supported by the data, so the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"in half of its season, ensign racing earn zero point on the F1 circuit\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. The columns are year, chassis, engine(s), tyres, and points. Each row represents a specific year from 1973 to 1982 for Ensign Racing, showing their performance in terms of the points they earned that season.\n\nThe claim states that half of their seasons resulted in zero points. So, I need to check how many seasons have zero points and see if that number is exactly half of all the seasons listed.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\n1. 1973: Points = 0\n2. 1974: Points = 0\n3. 1975: Points = 1\n4. 1976: Points = 2\n5. 1977: Points = 10\n6. 1978: Points = 1\n7. 1979: Points = 0\n8. 1980: Points = 0\n9. 1981: Points = 5\n10. 1982: Points = 0\n\nCounting the zero-point seasons:\n\n- 1973: Yes (Row 0)\n- 1974: Yes (Row 1)\n- 1979: Yes (Row 6)\n- 1980: Yes (Row 7)\n- 1982: Yes (Row 9)\n\nWait, that's five seasons with zero points. Let me recount to make sure I didn't miss any:\n\nRows where points = 0 are rows 0, 1, 6, 7, and 9. That's five instances.\n\nNow, how many total seasons are there? The data has entries from 1973 to 1982, which is 10 years in total (including both 1973 and 1982). So, half of the seasons would be 5. Since Ensign Racing earned zero points in exactly five seasons, that matches the claim.\n\nWait a second, but looking back at row indices:\n\n- Row 0: 1973\n- Row 1: 1974\n- Row 2: 1975 (Points=1)\n- Row 3: 1976 (Points=2)\n- Row 4: 1977 (Points=10)\n- Row 5: 1978 (Points=1)\n- Row 6: 1979\n- Row 7: 1980\n- Row 8: 1981 (Points=5)\n- Row 9: 1982\n\nSo, zero-point seasons are rows 0,1,6,7,9. That's five rows out of ten. Therefore, half the seasons had zero points.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that all entries in these rows indeed have zero points:\n\nRow 0: 0 - yes\nRow 1: 0 - yes\nRow 6: 0 - yes\nRow 7: 0 - yes\nRow 9: 0 - yes\n\nYes, five instances. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, compiling the relevant cells for each zero-point season:\n\nFor each row with points=0, we need to include the \"points\" column in the relevant_cells list along with their respective row indices.\n\nSo the relevant rows are 0,1,6,7,9. Each of these has the points column as the fifth element (column index 4), which is named \"points\".\n\nTherefore, the relevant_ cells will be:\n\n- {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n- {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n- {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n- {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n- {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n\nThis way, each instance where Ensign Racing earned zero points is accounted for.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_ cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}",

It mentions that Ensign had their most successful season in 1977 with 10 points earned.\n\nLooking at the table structure: The columns are \"year\", \"chassis\", \"engine (s)\", \"tyres\", and \"points\". I'm interested in two things: the year being 1977 and the corresponding points for that year. \n\nI'll go through each row to find where the year is 1977. Scanning the data array:\n\n- The fifth element (index starting at 0) has a year of 1977.\n- Looking at the \"points\" column in that row, it shows 10 points.\n\nNow, I should check if this is indeed the highest point total in the table. Let's review all the points across each year:\n\n- 1973: 0\n- 1974: 0\n- 1975: 1\n- 1976: 2\n- 1977: 10\n- 1978: 1\n- 1979: 0\n- 1980: 0\n- 1981: 5\n- 1982: 0\n\nThe highest points are 10 in 1977, which aligns with the claim.

The relevant information here is probably the 'year' and whether they participated each year, maybe inferred by having a chassis or points.\n\nLet me go through each year from 1973 to 1982 as per the data:\n\n- 1973: Yes, there's a row with 1973.\n- 1974: Also present.\n- 1975: The claim says they did not have a car this year. Let me check the 1975 entry. It exists, so Ensign had a car in 1975 according to the table. That seems contradictory because the claim states they were not present that year.\n\nWait, but maybe I should look at points or something else. In 1973 and 1974, their points are 0, which might mean no participation? Or just that they didn't score points. Similarly, in 1975, they have 1 point. So perhaps they did participate.\n\nBut the claim says \"but not in 1975,\" meaning Ensign should not have a car that year according to the data. However, looking at the table:\n\n- For each year from 1973 to 1982 (excluding 1975), I see entries except for 1983 which isn't in the claim.\n\nWait no, the years go up to 1982 as per the data. Let me list all the years present:\n\n- 1973\n- 1974\n- 1975\n- 1976\n- 1977\n- 1978\n- 1979\n- 1980\n- 1981\n- 1982\n\nWait, that's all the years from 1973 to 1982. So according to the table, Ensign had entries every year including 1975.\n\nThe claim says they were present from 1973 to 1982 but not in 1975. That seems conflicting because the data shows a presence in 1975 with points of 1.\n\nSo if the table includes Ensign in 1975, then the claim is incorrect because it says they weren't present that year.\n\nWait, but maybe \"ensign race field\" refers to something else. Let me check the 'chassis' column:\n\nIn 1975, the chassis is listed as \"ensign n174 ensign n175\". So that's two chassis models for 1975, meaning they had cars.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because Ensign did have F1 cars in 1975 according to the table. Thus, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nI need to identify which cells are relevant. The key rows would be each year from 1973 to 1982, but especially 1975. So for each row, checking the 'year' column is necessary. Also, looking at whether they had a chassis (indicating presence) or points.\n\nSo the relevant cells are all the rows for each year in question, specifically their 'chassis' and 'points' columns to determine participation.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Ensign had F1 cars from 1973 to 1982 but not in 1975.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"in the 6 year run on goodyear , they earn point in 4 year , whereas in the 4 year run other tire , they take zero point.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is referring to.\n\nSo, breaking it down:\n\n1. There's a period of 6 years where they used Goodyear tires.\n2. In those 6 years, they earned points in 4 of them.\n3. Then there's another period of 4 years where they didn't use Goodyear tires (other tire brands).\n4. In these 4 years, they took zero points.\n\nI need to check the table to see if this holds true.\n\nLooking at the table columns: year, chassis, engine(s), tyres, points.\n\nThe 'tyres' column indicates which tire brand was used each year. The 'points' column shows the points earned that year.\n\nLet me list out the years and corresponding tyre types and points:\n\n- 1973: F, 0\n- 1974: F, 0\n- 1975: G, 1\n- 1976: G, 2\n- 1977: G, 10\n- 1978: G, 1\n- 1979: G, 0\n- 1980: G, 0\n- 1981: M A, 5 (I think this means they used Michelin and Avon tires)\n- 1982: P, 0\n\nWait, the claim mentions a \"6 year run on Goodyear\" and a \"4 year run other tire.\" Let me see how many years they used Goodyear.\n\nLooking at the 'tyres' column:\n\nGoodyear is denoted by G. So from 1975 to 1980, that's six years: 1975 (G), 1976 (G), 1977 (G), 1978 (G), 1979 (G), 1980 (G). That makes six consecutive years of using Goodyear.\n\nNow, during these six years (1975-1980), how many points did they earn? Let's check the 'points' for each year:\n\n- 1975: 1\n- 1976: 2\n- 1977: 10\n- 1978: 1\n- 1979: 0\n- 1980: 0\n\nAdding up the points where they earned more than zero: 1, 2, 10, 1. That's four years where they earned points (1975, 1976, 1977, 1978). In two of those six years (1979 and 1980), they got zero points.\n\nSo the first part of the claim checks out: in the 6-year Goodyear run, they earned points in 4 years.\n\nNow, the second part says \"in the 4 year run other tire , they take zero point.\" So looking for a period where they didn't use Goodyear (i.e., tyres are not G) for four consecutive years and during that time, their points were zero each year.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nAfter 1980, in 1981: tyres are M A (so other brands), points are 5. That's a point earned, which contradicts the claim of taking zero points.\n\nIn 1982: tyres are P (another brand), points are 0.\n\nBut let me see if there's any four-year span where they used non-Goodyear tires and all those years had zero points.\n\nFrom the data:\n\n- 1973: F, 0\n- 1974: F, 0\n\nSo in 1973 and 1974, they used F tyres (not G) and got zero points. But that's only two years.\n\nThen from 1981 to 1982:\n\n1981: M A, 5 points\n1982: P, 0\n\nBut these are not four consecutive years, and in 1981 they earned points.\n\nWait, maybe the claim refers to a different period. Let me check all possible periods where non-G tyres were used:\n\nLooking at all rows where tyres != G:\n\n- 1973: F, 0\n- 1974: F, 0\n- 1981: M A, 5\n- 1982: P, 0\n\nSo the non-G periods are:\n\n1973-1974 (two years) and 1981-1982 (two years).\n\nIn these periods, in 1973 and 1974, they got zero points. But that's only two years.\n\nThe claim says a four-year run where other tyres were used and zero points earned. However, from the data, there isn't a four-year stretch where non-G tyres were used every year with zero points.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the data for any four consecutive years without Goodyear.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1973: F (non-G), 0\n1974: F (non-G), 0\nThen from 1975 to 1980, all G.\nAfter that:\n1981: M A (non-G), 5 points\n1982: P (non-G), 0\n\nSo the non-G periods are:\n\n- 1973-1974: two years, both zero points.\n- 1981-1982: two years, one with points and one without.\n\nNo four-year stretch of non-G. So perhaps the claim is incorrect? Or maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, let's see if there are any other periods:\n\nLooking at all data, after 1974, they use G until 1980. Then in 1981 and 1982, non-G again. So the non-G runs are two years each time, not four.\n\nThus, the claim that there's a four-year run with other tyres where zero points were earned isn't supported by the data. The only four-year period without G would require looking beyond the given data, but as per the provided information, it doesn't exist.\n\nTherefore, the second part of the claim is not accurate based on the data.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis reveals that while the team earned points in four out of six consecutive years using Goodyear tyres (1975-1980), there isn't a four-year period where they used non-Goodyear tyres and consistently scored zero points. The longest streaks without Goodyear were two years each, with at least one year having earned points. Thus, only the first part of the claim is valid.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nOnly the first part of the claim is accurate. The team earned points in four out of six consecutive years using Goodyear tyres from 1975 to 1980. However, there isn't a four-year period where they used non-Goodyear tyres and consistently scored zero points.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{Only the first part is correct}}$",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"in every season but 1, ensign racing earn zero points on the f1 circuit.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the table shows. Looking at the columns: year, chassis, engine(s), tyres, and points. So for each year from 1973 to 1982, it lists Ensign's performance with different models, engines, tyre types, and the points they earned.\n\nThe claim is that in every season except one, Ensign earned zero points. So I need to check how many seasons had non-zero points.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- 1973: Points = 0\n- 1974: Points = 0\n- 1975: Points = 1 \u2192 This is the first season with points.\n- 1976: Points = 2 \u2192 Another season with points.\n- 1977: Points = 10 \u2192 More points here.\n- 1978: Points = 1\n- 1979: Points = 0\n- 1980: Points = 0\n- 1981: Points = 5\n- 1982: Points = 0\n\nWait, that's more than one season with non-zero points. Let me count:\n\nSeasons with non-zero points:\n- 1975: 1\n- 1976: 2\n- 1977: 10\n- 1978: 1\n- 1981: 5\n\nThat's five seasons where they earned points, not just one. So the claim is incorrect because there are multiple years with non-zero points.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells for each of these rows to support this conclusion. Each row has a \"points\" column that shows the value, so I need to list the row indices and column names for those where points > 0.\n\nSo rows 2 (1975), 3 (1976), 4 (1977), 5 (1978), and 8 (1981) all have points greater than zero.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the Ensign race cars is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table data.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim clearly: \"Ensign race use Ford V8 engine in every race except for 2, and use the same time manufacturer every time.\" Wait, there might be a typo. It probably means \"same tyre manufacturer\" instead of \"time.\" That makes more sense because the table includes a \"tyres\" column.\n\nSo, breaking down the claim into two parts:\n1. Ensign used Ford V8 engines in all races except for 2.\n2. They used the same tyre manufacturer every time.\n\nNow, let's examine each part using the provided JSON data.\n\n**Part 1: Engine Usage**\nLooking at the \"engine (s)\" column across all rows:\n- Year 1973: Ford V8\n- Year 1974: Ford V8\n- Year 1975: Ford V8\n- Year 1976: Ford V8\n- Year 1977: Ford V8\n- Year 1978: Ford V8\n- Year 1979: Ford V8\n- Year 1980: Ford V8\n- Year 1981: Ford V8\n- Year 1982: Ford V8\n\nIt seems that in every year from 1973 to 1982, the engine used was consistently Ford V8. There's no variation here; all entries under \"engine (s)\" are Ford V8. Therefore, the first part of the claim\u2014that they used Ford V8 in every race except for two\u2014does not hold true because there's no instance where a different engine was used.\n\n**Part 2: Tyre Manufacturer Consistency**\nNext, let's check the \"tyres\" column to see if Ensign used the same tyre manufacturer each year:\n- Year 1973: F\n- Year 1974: F\n- Year 1975: G\n- Year 1976: G\n- Year 1977: G\n- Year 1978: G\n- Year 1979: G\n- Year 1980: G\n- Year 1981: M A (this seems different)\n- Year 1982: P\n\nLooking at this, the tyre manufacturer changes over the years. In 1973 and 1974, it's F. Then from 1975 onwards, it's mostly G except for 1981 where it's M A and 1982 where it's P. So, they did not use the same tyre manufacturer every time; there are multiple changes.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBoth parts of the claim fail:\n- The engine was always Ford V8, so using it in all races except two is incorrect.\n- The tyre manufacturers changed several times, so they didn't stay consistent.\n\nTherefore, the entire claim is FALSE. \n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells that were checked:\n- For engines: Every row's \"engine (s)\" column to confirm if any variation exists.\n- For tyres: Every row's \"tyres\" column to check for consistency.\n\nSo, all rows are relevant for both columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine whether the claim about Ensign Race's most successful season being 1980 with 10 points is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim: \"ensign race's most successful season be 1980 , when it earn 10 point on the f1 race circuit.\" The key parts are that the most successful year was 1980 and they earned 10 points.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are year, chassis, engine(s), tyres, and points. I'll need to examine each row's 'year' and 'points' to verify the claim.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Year 1973, Points 0\n- Row 1: Year 1974, Points 0\n- Row 2: Year 1975, Points 1\n- Row 3: Year 1976, Points 2\n- Row 4: Year 1977, Points 10\n- Row 5: Year 1978, Points 1\n- Row 6: Year 1979, Points 0\n- Row 7: Year 1980, Points 0\n- Row 8: Year 1981, Points 5\n- Row 9: Year 1982, Points 0\n\nFrom this, I notice that in 1977 (Row 4), the points are 10.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"In the 6 year run on Goodyear, Ensign Racing earned points in 3 years.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into parts. \n\n1. **Identify the relevant columns**: We're looking at 'year', 'tyres', and 'points'.\n\n2. **Determine the time frame (6-year run)**: The claim mentions a 6-year period where Ensign Racing used Goodyear tyres.\n\n3. **Find the years with Goodyear tyres**: Looking through the 'tyres' column, we see that \"g\" represents Goodyear. Let's check which rows have \"g\":\n\n   - Row 2 (1975): tyres = g\n   - Row 3 (1976): tyres = g\n   - Row 4 (1977): tyres = g\n   - Row 5 (1978): tyres = g\n   - Row 6 (1979): tyres = g\n   - Row 8 (1981): tyres = m a (but this might be mixed, not sure if it's Goodyear only)\n   \nWait, actually, let me recount:\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\n- 1975: tyres \"g\" \u2192 yes.\n- 1976: \"g\"\n- 1977: \"g\"\n- 1978: \"g\"\n- 1979: \"g\"\n- 1980: \"g\"? No, wait row 7 is 1980 with tyres \"g\" (row index 6? Wait, let me check the indices correctly.\n\nWait, in JSON data, the rows are zero-indexed:\n\nRow 2: 1975\nRow 3: 1976\nRow 4: 1977\nRow 5: 1978\nRow 6: 1979\nRow 7: 1980 \u2192 tyres \"g\"\nSo, rows with \"g\" are from 1975 to 1980. That's six years: 1975-1980 inclusive (that's 6 years). So the 6-year run is correct.\n\n4. **Check in how many of these years Ensign Racing earned points**:\n\nLooking at 'points' column for rows where tyres are \"g\":\n\n- 1975: 1 point \u2192 yes\n- 1976: 2 points \u2192 yes\n- 1977: 10 points \u2192 yes\n- 1978: 1 point \u2192 yes\nWait, but the claim says earned points in 3 years. Let me count how many of these have points > 0.\n\nWait:\n\nRow indices with \"g\":\n\nRows 2 (1975): points =1\n\nRow3 (1976): points=2\n\nRow4 (1977): points=10\n\nRow5 (1978): points=1\n\nRow6 (1979): points=0 \u2192 no\n\nRow7 (1980): points=0 \u2192 no\n\nWait, but the 6-year run from 1975 to 1980 is correct. Now, in these years:\n\n- 1975: 1 point\n- 1976: 2 points\n- 1977: 10 points\n- 1978: 1 point\n- 1979: 0 \u2192 no\n- 1980: 0 \u2192 no\n\nSo, in the six years, Ensign Racing earned points in 1975, 1976, 1977, and 1978. That's four years where they had points.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"earned points in 3 years.\" Hmm. So according to this, it should be four years, not three. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because Ensign Racing earned points in four of the six Goodyear years, not three.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list them again:\n\nRows with \"g\" and year from 1975 to 1980 inclusive (rows 2-7):\n\nRow2: 1975 \u2192 points=1 \u2192 yes\n\nRow3: 1976 \u2192 points=2 \u2192 yes\n\nRow4: 1977 \u2192 points=10 \u2192 yes\n\nRow5: 1978 \u2192 points=1 \u2192 yes\n\nRow6: 1979 \u2192 points=0 \u2192 no\n\nRow7: 1980 \u2192 points=0 \u2192 no\n\nSo, in these six rows (years), four have points. So the claim says \"earned points in 3 years,\" but it's actually four. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the time frame. Maybe the \"6-year run\" refers to consecutive years where they were on Goodyear. Let me check if all six years have \"g\". From row2 (1975) to row7 (1980), each year's tyre is \"g.\" So yes, it's a continuous 6-year period.\n\nSo Ensign Racing earned points in four of those six years, which contradicts the claim that they earned points in three. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are other rows with \"g\". Wait, row8 (1981) has tyres \"m a\", which might not be Goodyear. So only rows 2-7 have \"g.\"\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would include all these six years to check for points:\n\nRelevant cells would be rows where 'tyres' is 'g', and within those, check their 'points'.\n\nSo relevant_cells would include row indices 2 (1975),3(1976),4(1977),5(1978),6(1979),7(1980), each with the 'tyres' and 'points' columns.\n\nBut in JSON, to specify which rows and which fields, perhaps we just list all these row indices and their points.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE because they earned points in four years, not three.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Ensign Racing earned points in three of the six years they were on Goodyear tyres is incorrect. They actually earned points in four of those six years.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is false.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Identify the 6-year period with Goodyear tyres: 1975-1980 (rows 2-7).\n2. Check each year for points:\n   - 1975: 1 point\n   - 1976: 2 points\n   - 1977: 10 points\n   - 1978: 1 point\n   - 1979: 0 points\n   - 1980: 0 points\n3. Count the years with points: Four years (1975, 1976, 1977, 1978).\n4. The claim states three years, but four years had points.\n   \nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**The statement is false.**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"is_claim_true\": false,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Ensign Racing earned points in four of the six years they were on Goodyear tyres (1975, 1976, 1977, and 1978), not three.\"\n}\n```",
