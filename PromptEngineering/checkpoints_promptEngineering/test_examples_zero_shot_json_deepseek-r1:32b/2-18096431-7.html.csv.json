The columns are place, player, country, score, to par, and money. Each row represents a player's performance with their respective stats.\n\nThe claim mentions two players: Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry. It says they tie for having the lowest \"to par.\" So, I need to look at their \"to par\" values and see if it's the lowest in the table.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Mark Brooks is in row 0 (index starts at 0). His \"to par\" is \"-11\".\n- Kenny Perry is in row 1. His \"to par\" is also \"-11\".\n\nNow, I should check other players to see if anyone has a lower \"to par.\" A lower score here would mean more negative numbers because \"to par\" indicates how much under or over the player is compared to the course's par.\n\nLooking through the rest of the data:\n\n- Steve Elkington and Tommy Tolles: both have \"-10\".\n- Justin Leonard, Jesper Parnevik, Vijay Singh: all have \"-9\".\n- Lee Janzen, Per-Ulrik Johansson, Phil Mickelson, Larry Mize, Frank Nobilo, Nick Price: all have \"-8\".\n\nSo, the \"to par\" scores are as follows:\n- -11 (Brooks and Perry)\n- -10\n- -9\n- -8\n\nSince -11 is lower than -10, -9, and -8, Brooks and Perry indeed have the lowest \"to par\" score. Therefore, their claim that they tie for the lowest to par is TRUE.\n\nI should note the relevant cells: both players' \"to par\" entries. For Mark Brooks, it's row 0, column \"to par\".

Are there any other players listed as being from New Zealand besides him?\n\nLooking at the data, I'll go through each row and check the \"country\" column for entries equal to \"new zealand.\"\n\nStarting with row 0: Mark Brooks is from the United States.\nRow 1: Kenny Perry is also from the US.\nRow 2: Steve Elkington is from Australia.\nRow 3: Tommy Tolles is from the US.\nRow 4: Justin Leonard, same as above.\nRow 5: Jesper Parnevik is from Sweden.\nRow 6: Vijay Singh is from Fiji.\nRow 7: Lee Janzen, US again.\nRow 8: Per-Ulrik Johansson, another Swedish player.\nRow 9: Phil Mickelson, US.\nRow 10: Larry Mize, US as well.\nRow 11: Frank Nobilo is listed here with the country \"new zealand.\" So that's one player from New Zealand.\nRow 12: Nick Price is from Zimbabwe.\n\nSo in row 11, Frank Nobilo is the only entry where the country is New Zealand.

I need to determine if the claim \"frank nobilo be the only player from zimbabwe\" is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are place, player, country, score, to par, and money. So each row represents a player's performance in some event.\n\nThe claim says that Frank Nobilo is the only player from Zimbabwe. To verify this, I need to check two things: first, does Frank Nobilo appear in the table as a player from Zimbabwe? And second, are there any other players listed with Zimbabwe as their country?\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 12 (index starting from 0): place t8, player frank nobilo, country new zealand.

So the claim mentions frank nobilo as being from zimbabwe, but according to the table, frank nobilo is from new zealand. Nick Price is the one from Zimbabwe.\n\nSo in the table, there's only one player from Zimbabwe: Nick Price. Therefore, Frank Nobilo is not the only player from Zimbabwe; in fact, he isn't even from Zimbabwe. The claim is incorrect because it misidentifies Frank Nobilo's country and also states that he is the only one, but another player (Nick Price) is actually from Zimbabwe.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be where the country is listed for frank nobilo and nick price. That's row 11 (frank's country) and row 12 (nick's country).\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"kenny perry earn 170000 more than mark brook\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It says Kenny Perry earned $170,000 more than Mark Brook. So I need to compare their earnings from the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a player's performance in a tournament. The columns include place, player name, country, score, to par, and money. The \"money\" column is where the earnings are listed.\n\nI'll start by locating both players in the data array. \n\n- Mark Brooks is in the first row (index 0). His earnings are 430,000.\n- Kenny Perry is in the second row (index 1). His earnings are 260,000.\n\nNow, I need to calculate if Kenny Perry earned $170,000 more than Mark Brooks. To do that, I'll subtract Kenny's money from Mark's money: 430,000 - 260,000 = 170,000.\n\nWait a minute, but the claim says Kenny earned 170,000 more than Mark. However, according to these numbers, Mark earned more. So actually, Mark has $430k and Kenny has $260k, which means Mark earned $170k more than Kenny, not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it states that Kenny earned more when in fact he earned less. The difference is indeed $170,000, but it's Mark who earned more.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"money\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
