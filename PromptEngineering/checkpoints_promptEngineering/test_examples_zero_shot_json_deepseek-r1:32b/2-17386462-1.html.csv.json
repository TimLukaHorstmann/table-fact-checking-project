    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format. Let's break down each part of the claim and check it against the data.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"the netherfield lost the most game with 28 loss.\" Looking at the table, Netherfield is row 21 (since rows are zero-indexed). The column for losses is \"lost,\" which has a value of 28. So yes, Netherfield did lose 28 games. I'll note this cell as relevant.\n\nNext part: \"the gateshead team and the southport team tie with the most game draw at 14.\" Let's check Gateshead (row 3) and Southport (row 7). The column for draws is \"drawn.\" Gateshead has 14 draws, and Southport also has 14. So they do tie at 14 drawn games each. I'll add both rows' \"drawn\" columns to the relevant cells.\n\nLastly: \"the bangor city team come in first position with 108 goal overall for the team.\" Bangor City is row 0. The column \"goals for\" shows 108, and their position is indeed 1. So this part is correct as well. I'll include row 0's \"position\" and \"goals for\" columns.\n\nPutting it all together: All parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly identifies Netherfield with the most losses (28), Gateshead and Southport each having 14 draws, and Bangor City being first with 108 goals.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the highest number of game lost be 23 by team matlock town\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table structure given in JSON format. It has columns: position, team, played, drawn, lost, goals for, goals against, goal difference, points 1. There are 22 rows of data corresponding to different teams.\n\nThe claim mentions two things:\n1. The highest number of games lost is 23.\n2. This high number is achieved by the team \"matlock town\".\n\nTo verify this, I need to check all the entries in the 'lost' column and find out which team has the maximum value there. Also, I should confirm that matlock town indeed lost 23 games.\n\nLooking through each row:\n- The first few teams have lost between 7 to 16 games.\n- As we go down, some teams like workington (row 10) and others show higher loss counts.\n- When I reach row 20, it's matlock town with a 'lost' value of 23. That's the highest in the table.\n\nI'll cross-verify to ensure no other team has lost more than 23 games. Checking all rows confirms that 23 is indeed the maximum, and it's attributed to matlock town.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are accurate: the highest number of losses is 23, and matlock town is the team with this record.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
