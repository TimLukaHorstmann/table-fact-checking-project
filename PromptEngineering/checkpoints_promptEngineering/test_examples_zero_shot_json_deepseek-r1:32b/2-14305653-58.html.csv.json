    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the yugoslavian national team win both of its friendly match by a score of 2:1.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is stating. It's saying that Yugoslavia won two friendly matches, each with a score of 2-1. So, my task is to check if there are exactly two such matches in the table where the type of game is \"friendly,\" and both resulted in a 2:1 win for Yugoslavia.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: date, city, opponent, results, and type of game. The data rows have these details for each match.\n\nI'll start by identifying all rows where the type of game is \"friendly.\" Let's go through each row:\n\nRow 0:\n- Type of game: friendly\n- Results: 2:1\n\nRow 2:\n- Type of game: friendly\n- Results: 2:1\n\nRows 3,4,5,6 have types as 'balkan cup', '1982 wcq', etc., so they aren't friendly matches.\n\nSo, there are two rows where the type is friendly. Now, I need to check if both of these resulted in a win for Yugoslavia with a score of 2:1.\n\nIn Row 0:\n- The result is 2:1. Assuming the first number represents Yugoslavia's score and the second is the opponent's, this would mean a 2-1 win for Yugoslavia. Opponent is Uruguay.\n\nRow 2:\n- Result is also 2:1 against Poland in Borovo on April 26. So another 2-1 victory.\n\nTherefore, both friendly matches ended with a 2:1 win for Yugoslavia. This seems to fully support the claim.\n\nI should double-check if there are any other friendly matches beyond these two that I might have missed. Scanning through all rows again, nope, only two friendly games listed in the data provided.\n\nHence, the relevant cells are from row 0 and row 2 where the type of game is 'friendly' and results are '2:1'.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"type of game\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"results\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"type of game\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"results\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about the Yugoslavian national team is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim and check each part against the data.\n\nThe claim states: \"the yugoslavian national team suffer its worst outcome lose 1:4 in the balkan cup against romania on august 27\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for a game that took place on August 27. Scanning through the dates in the table:\n\n- Row 0: March 22\n- Row 1: March 30\n- Row 2: April 26\n- Row 3: August 27\n- Rows 4,5,6 are September and November.\n\nSo row index 3 is the relevant one for August 27.\n\nNext, let's check the details in that row:\n\n- City: \"bucharest , romania\" \u2013 opponent might be Romania here.\n- Opponent: \"romania\"\n- Results: \"1:4\" \u2013 so Yugoslavia lost 1 to 4.\n- Type of game: \"balkan cup\"\n\nPutting it together, on August 27 in Bucharest against Romania in a Balkan Cup match, Yugoslavia lost with a score of 1:4. The claim mentions this as their worst outcome. Looking at the other results:\n\nRow 0: 2:1 win\nRow 1: 2:0 win\nRow 2: 2:1 win\nRow 3: 1:4 loss (Balkan Cup)\nRow 4: 5:0 win\nRow 5: 2:1 win\nRow 6: 0:2 loss\n\nSo the only other loss is a 0:2 against Italy. Comparing 1:4 and 0:2, 1:4 is indeed a worse result in terms of goal difference. Therefore, this claim seems to be supported by the data.\n\nNow, mapping each part:\n\n- Date (august 27): row 3, column \"date\"\n- Opponent (romania): row 3, column \"opponent\"\n- Results (1:4 loss): row 3, column \"results\"\n- Type of game (balkan cup): row 3, column \"type of game\"\n\nSo all the relevant cells are in row 3 across these columns.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table in JSON format. The claim says: \"the yugoslavian national team lose the balkan cup against romania with a aggregate score of 3:4.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what needs to be verified here. The key points are:\n\n1. Yugoslavia played against Romania in the Balkan Cup.\n2. They lost the game with an aggregate score of 3-4.\n\nLooking at the table, there are two rows related to the Balkan Cup. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nThe first relevant row is index 1:\n- Date: March 30\n- City: Belgrade\n- Opponent: Romania\n- Results: 2:0\n- Type of game: Balkan Cup\n\nSo, Yugoslavia beat Romania 2-0 in this match. That's a win, not a loss.\n\nThe second relevant row is index 3:\n- Date: August 27\n- City: Bucharest, Romania\n- Opponent: Romania\n- Results: 1:4\n- Type of game: Balkan Cup\n\nIn this match, Yugoslavia lost 1-4 to Romania. So that's a loss.\n\nNow, the claim mentions an aggregate score of 3:4. Aggregate scores usually refer to two-legged ties, like home and away matches. Let's see if there are two matches between Yugoslavia and Romania in the Balkan Cup.\n\nLooking at row 1 and row 3, they played twice. The first match was a 2-0 win for Yugoslavia in Belgrade (row 1), and the second was a 1-4 loss in Bucharest (row 3). So combining both results:\n\nYugoslavia's total goals: 2 + 1 = 3\nRomania's total goals: 0 + 4 = 4\n\nSo the aggregate is indeed 3:4, meaning Yugoslavia lost on aggregate. Therefore, the claim is correct.\n\nWait a second\u2014does the table show both legs? Because in row 1, it's a friendly match? No, actually, row 1 is a Balkan Cup game as well. Let me check again:\n\nRow 0: Friendly\nRow 1: Balkan Cup (2-0 win)\nRow 2: Friendly\nRow 3: Balkan Cup (1-4 loss)\n\nSo two matches in the Balkan Cup against Romania, one at home and one away. The total is 3-4 aggregate.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Yugoslavia lost the Balkan Cup to Romania with an aggregate of 3:4.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Yugoslavia lost the Balkan Cup against Romania with an aggregate score of 3:4. Checking the table, there are two relevant matches: a 2-0 win in Belgrade (row 1) and a 1-4 loss in Bucharest (row 3). Combining these results gives an aggregate of 3-4, confirming the loss.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"type of game\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"type of game\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let's break down the claim: \"the yugoslavian national team fail to score only 1 time, drop a world cup qualify match 0:2 against italy.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is saying. The first part claims that Yugoslavia failed to score only once. The second part says they lost a World Cup qualifier (WCQ) match 0-2 against Italy.\n\nLooking at the table, there are seven matches listed. Each row has details about the date, city, opponent, results, and type of game. I'll go through each relevant column step by step.\n\n1. **Identifying Matches Against Italy:**\n   The claim mentions a specific match against Italy in a World Cup qualifier. So I'll look for rows where the opponent is Italy and the type of game is WCQ.\n\n   Scanning through, the last row (row index 6) shows:\n   - Opponent: Italy\n   - Results: 0:2\n   - Type of Game: 1982 wcq\n\n   So this matches exactly. Yugoslavia lost 0-2 against Italy in a WCQ match.\n\n2. **Counting Matches Where Yugoslavia Failed to Score:**\n   The claim says they failed to score only once. To verify this, I'll check the results column for all rows where Yugoslavia's score is zero.\n\n   Going through each row:\n   - Row 0: Results 2:1 \u2192 Yugoslavia scored.\n   - Row 1: 2:0 \u2192 Scored.\n   - Row 2: 2:1 \u2192 Scored.\n   - Row 3: 1:4 \u2192 Scored once.\n   - Row 4: 5:0 \u2192 Scored five times.\n   - Row 5: 2:1 \u2192 Scored twice.\n   - Row 6: 0:2 \u2192 Failed to score.\n\n   So only in row 6 did Yugoslavia fail to score. That's one instance, which matches the claim.\n\n3. **Checking for Any Other WCQ Matches Where They Lost Without Scoring:**\n   The claim also mentions they \"drop a world cup qualify match,\" so I need to ensure that this was their only such loss in a WCQ. Looking at other WCQ rows:\n   - Row 4 and 5 are both WCQ matches where Yugoslavia won (5:0 vs Luxembourg, 2:1 vs Denmark). Only row 6 is a WCQ loss, specifically against Italy.\n\n4. **Ensuring No Other Matches Had Zero Goals Scored:**\n   From the results above, only row 6 shows zero goals scored by Yugoslavia. So the claim that they failed to score only once holds true.\n\nPutting it all together:\n- There's exactly one match where Yugoslavia didn't score (row 6).\n- That match was a WCQ against Italy, which they lost 0-2.\n- No other matches in the table show Yugoslavia failing to score or losing a WCQ match without scoring.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table. The relevant cells are the result and type of game columns for that specific row. I'll note these as the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"type of game\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine if a specific claim about the Yugoslavian national team's performance in 1982 World Cup qualifiers is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the data. The table has columns: date, city, opponent, results, and type of game. There are seven rows of data, each representing a match. My goal is to find all matches that were part of the 1982 World Cup qualifiers (type of game is \"1982 wcq\") and then calculate the total goals scored by Yugoslavia and the goals they conceded.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan each row to identify which ones are related to the \"1982 wcq\". \n\n- The first three rows have types \"friendly\" or \"balkan cup\", so they don't count.\n- Starting from the fourth row:\n  - Row 4: type is \"1982 wcq\"\n  - Row 5: type is \"1982 wcq\"\n  - Row 6: type is \"1982 wcq\"\n\nSo, there are three matches relevant to the claim. \n\nNext, I'll extract the results from these rows:\n- Row 4: \"5:0\" \u2013 This means Yugoslavia scored 5 and allowed 0.\n- Row 5: \"2:1\" \u2013 Yugoslavia scored 2 and allowed 1.\n- Row 6: \"0:2\" \u2013 Yugoslavia scored 0 and allowed 2.\n\nNow, I'll sum up the goals:\n- Total goals scored by Yugoslavia: 5 + 2 + 0 = 7\n- Total goals conceded: 0 + 1 + 2 = 3\n\nThe claim states that Yugoslavia scored 7 goals and allowed 3 in these three matches.

My task is to check if all friendly matches resulted in a 0:2 victory for Yugoslavia.\n\nI'll go through each row where the type of game is \"friendly.\" From the table:\n\n1. Row 0: Type is friendly, result is 2:1. So Yugoslavia won 2-1.\n2. Row 2: Type is friendly again, result is also 2:1. Another win.\n\nSo there are two friendly matches in total. Both resulted in a 2:1 victory for Yugoslavia. Now, the claim says they won both by 0:2. But wait, in reality, 2:1 means Yugoslavia scored twice and conceded once.

The claim mentions both Italy and Romania as opponents. Looking at the table, I need to check if Yugoslavia (now known as Serbia) played against both countries and whether their combined (aggregate) score was 3:4.\n\nLet's examine each relevant match:\n\n1. **Match on September 27**: Against Denmark in Ljubljana. The result is a win with 2:1, which doesn't involve Romania or Italy.\n2. **Match on November 15**: In Torino, Italy against Italy. Yugoslavia lost 0:2 here.\n3. **Match on August 27**: In Bucharest against Romania as part of the Balkan Cup. The result is a loss with 1:4.\n\nNow, checking for both opponents mentioned in the claim:\n\n- Against Italy: They lost 0:2 (aggregate 0 from this match).\n- Against Romania: They lost 1:4 (aggregate 5 from this match).\n\nWait, but the claim says \"lose the italy against romania,\" which seems a bit unclear. Perhaps it means Yugoslavia played both Italy and Romania in some context where their aggregate score combines.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Total goals for Yugoslavia across all matches: Let's see:\n  - Against Uruguay: 2\n  - Against Romania (Balkan Cup): 1\n  - Against Poland: 2\n  - Against Denmark: 2\n  - Against Italy: 0\n  - Against Luxembourg: 5\nTotal: 12 goals.\n\nOpponents' total goals:\n- Uruguay: 1\n- Romania: 4 + ...

Let me check:\n\nIf we consider only the matches against Italy and Romania:\n\n- Against Italy: Yugoslavia scored 0, lost 0:2.\n- Against Romania: Scored 1, lost 1:4.\n\nCombined (aggregate), Yugoslavia's total is 0 + 1 = 1 goal; opponents' total is 2 + 4 = 6. That doesn't add up to 3:4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to a different context or another set of matches not listed here. However, based on the provided data, there's no match where Yugoslavia lost with an aggregate score of 3:4 against Romania and Italy combined.\n\nAdditionally, looking at all matches involving Romania:\n\n- August 27: 1:4 loss in Bucharest (Balkan Cup).\n\nAnd against Italy:\n\n- November 15: 0:2 loss in Torino (1982 WCQ).\n\nSo the total goals for Yugoslavia in these two matches are 1 + 0 = 1, and opponents' goals are 4 + 2 = 6. The aggregate score is 1:6, not 3:4.\n\nTherefore, the claim doesn't hold true based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Yugoslavia's total against Italy and Romania was 1:6, not 3:4.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE  \n**Relevant Cells:**\n- August 27 match against Romania (row index 3)\n- November 15 match against Italy (row index 6)\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the yugoslavian national team fail to score only 1 time , drop a world cup qualify match 2:1 against denmark\".\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. Yugoslavia failed to score only once.\n2. They lost a World Cup qualifier (WCQ) 2-1 against Denmark.\n\nLet's look at each part.\n\nFor the first part, checking when Yugoslavia didn't score any goals. Looking through the results column:\n- March 22: 2:1 \u2013 they scored 2, so not failing.\n- March 30: 2:0 \u2013 scored 2.\n- April 26: 2:1 \u2013 scored 2.\n- August 27: 1:4 \u2013 they scored 1, so not zero.\n- September 10: 5:0 \u2013 scored 5.\n- September 27: 2:1 \u2013 scored 2.\n- November 15: 0:2 \u2013 here, Yugoslavia didn't score (0). So only once did they fail to score.\n\nFor the second part, checking if they lost a WCQ against Denmark. Looking at the rows where type is \"1982 wcq\":\n- September 27: Opponent Denmark, result 2:1. Wait, that's a win for Yugoslavia since it's their score first. But wait, in soccer results, the first number is the home team's score. The location was Ljubljana, which I think is Yugoslavia's city. So 2:1 means they won against Denmark.\n\nWait, but the claim says they lost (drop) a match 2:1 against Denmark. That would mean their result was 1-2. But in the table, it's 2:1, so they won. So this part of the claim is incorrect because they actually won that match.\n\nSo while the first part is true (they failed to score only once), the second part is false because they didn't lose; they won 2-1 against Denmark in a WCQ. Therefore, the entire claim isn't fully supported and should be marked as FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states two things: Yugoslavia failing to score once and losing a WCQ match 2-1 to Denmark. The table shows only one instance where they didn't score (November 15). However, against Denmark on September 27, they won 2-1 in the WCQ. Therefore, the second part is false.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the yugoslavian national team score 7 goal and allow 3 against in the 2 1982 world cup qualify score",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the yugoslavian national team score 7 goal and allow 3 against in the 2 1982 world cup qualify score.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions Yugoslavia scoring 7 goals and conceding 3 across two 1982 World Cup qualifiers. So I need to look for rows where the type of game is \"1982 wcq\" because that indicates a qualifier match.\n\nLooking at the table data:\n\n- Row 4: September 10, Luxembourg vs Yugoslavia, result 5:0. Wait, no\u2014Luxembourg is the opponent here. So Yugoslavia won 5:0. That's 5 goals scored and 0 conceded.\n- Row 5: September 27, Ljubljana vs Denmark, result 2:1. So Yugoslavia scored 2 and conceded 1.\n- Row 6: November 15, Torino, Italy vs Yugoslavia, result 0:2. That means Yugoslavia lost 0:2, so they scored 0 and conceded 2.\n\nWait, but the claim is about two qualifiers. Let me count how many \"1982 wcq\" matches there are:\n\n- Rows 4,5,6 all have \"type of game\" as \"1982 wcq\", so that's three matches in total.\n\nNow, summing up the goals scored by Yugoslavia across these three matches:\nRow 4: 5\nRow 5: 2\nRow 6: 0\nTotal scored: 5 + 2 + 0 = 7 goals. That matches the claim of scoring 7 goals.\n\nConceded goals:\nRow 4: 0\nRow 5: 1\nRow 6: 2\nTotal conceded: 0 + 1 + 2 = 3 goals. This also matches the claim of allowing 3 goals.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"against in the 2\", which might imply two qualifiers, but there are three. However, perhaps it's a typo and they meant to refer to all their qualifiers. Since the total across all three is 7 scored and 3 conceded, the numbers fit regardless of whether it's two or three matches.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE because in the 1982 World Cup qualifiers (rows 4,5,6), Yugoslavia scored a total of 7 goals and allowed 3 goals.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Yugoslavia scored 7 goals and conceded 3 across their 1982 World Cup qualifiers. Checking the table:\n\n- **September 10**: Scored 5, conceded 0.\n- **September 27**: Scored 2, conceded 1.\n- **November 15**: Scored 0, conceded 2.\n\nTotal: 7 goals scored and 3 conceded across three matches. Thus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
