    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"rene lambert play right wing and be draft with the 146th pick\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim into its components. There are two parts here:\n1. Rene Lambert plays as a right wing.\n2. He was drafted with the 146th pick.\n\nI'll start by looking through the table to find the row that corresponds to Rene Lambert. Scanning through the data, I see that in row index 2 (since counting starts at 0), there's an entry for \"rene lambert\". \n\nLooking at the columns, the first column is \"pick\" which should indicate the draft pick number. In this case, the value under \"pick\" is 146, so that checks out for the second part of the claim.\n\nNext, I check the position he plays. The third column is \"position\", and for Rene Lambert, it's listed as \"right wing\". That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are accurately represented in the table data, the claim should be TRUE. \n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n- The pick number (146) is found in row index 2 under the column \"pick\".\n- The position (\"right wing\") is also in row index 2 under the column \"position\".\n\nSo both pieces of information are correctly supporting the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"right wing, rene lampert, be pick 145th.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down each part of the claim and check it against the table data.\n\nThe first part is the position: right wing. Looking at the columns in the JSON, there's a column named \"position\". So we need to find if Rene Lambert is listed as a right wing. Let me scan through the data rows.\n\nLooking at row index 2 (since indexing starts at 0), the player is Rene Lambert. His position is listed as \"right wing\". That matches the claim, so that's correct.\n\nNext part: the name. The claim says \"rene lampert.\" Wait, in the table, it's spelled \"rene lambert\" with a 'b'. So there might be a typo here. Is it possible that \"lampert\" is a misspelling? I should check if any other rows have similar names. Scanning through all the data, I don't see another Rene Lambert or anyone else with a similar name. So maybe the claim has a typo, but since we're checking based on what's in the table, I'll consider that the correct name is Rene Lambert.\n\nNow, the third part: \"be pick 145th.\" The table's first column is \"pick\", which seems to represent the pick number. Let's check Rene Lambert's pick number. In row index 2, under \"pick\", it's 146. So the pick number for Rene Lambert is 146, not 145.\n\nSo putting it all together: The position and player name (with possible typo) are correct, but the pick number doesn't match. Therefore, the claim that Rene Lambert was picked 145th is false because he's actually at pick 146.\n\nTo make sure I didn't miss anything else, I'll quickly check if any other rows have pick number 145. Looking through the data, row index 1 has pick number 145, which corresponds to Steve Lyon, not Rene Lambert. So that confirms it; pick 145 is someone else.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because of the wrong pick number.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Rene Lambert was picked 145th as a right wing. Checking the table, Rene Lambert's pick number is 146, not 145. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
