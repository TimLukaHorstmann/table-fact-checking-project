It states that at the venue named \"the stoop,\" the match had a score of 24-28. So, I need to check if there's any row in the data where both the 'venue' is \"the stoop\" and the 'score' is \"24 - 28.\"\n\nLooking through each row in the data array:\n\n1. The first few rows don't have \"the stoop\" as the venue, so I skip them.\n2. Continuing down, I check each 'venue' column:\n   - Row 0: odsal stadium\n   - Row 1: boundary park\n   - ...\n3. At row index 20, the venue is listed as \"the stoop.\"\n4. Now, checking the 'score' for this row. The score is given in the 'score' column, which is \"24 - 28.\"\n\nSince both conditions match\u2014venue is \"the stoop\" and score is \"24 - 28\"\u2014the claim is supported.\n\nI need to note the relevant cells:\n- The venue cell at row index 20.\n- The score cell at the same row index 20.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE with these two cells as relevant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 20,\n       \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 20,\n       \"column_name\": \"score\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"mcnamara score 3 / 4 goal when the venue be the stoop.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim step by step. The key elements are:\n1. Player: Mcnamara\n2. Score: 3/4 goals\n3. Venue: The Stoop\n\nI need to check if there's a row in the table where all these conditions are met.\n\nLooking at the columns, I see \"goals\" and \"venue\" are relevant here. So for each row, I'll check:\n- Is the venue \"the stoop\"?\n- If yes, does Mcnamara have a score of 3/4?\n\nLet's go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 20: Date 31/8/97\nVenue is \"the stoop\". Looking at the goals column: \"mcnamara 4 / 4\". So here, Mcnamara scored 4/4, not 3/4. Doesn't match.\n\nAny other rows with venue as the stoop? Scanning through, I don't see another row where venue is the stoop.\n\nTherefore, there's no row where Mcnamara scores exactly 3/4 when the venue is the stoop. So the claim isn't supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a specific instance where Mcnamara scored 3/4 goals at \"the stoop\" venue. Checking all rows, only one row has venue as \"the stoop,\" but there Mcnamara's score was 4/4. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
