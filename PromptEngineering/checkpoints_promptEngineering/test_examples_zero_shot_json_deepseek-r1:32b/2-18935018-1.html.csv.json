The columns are: school, location, mascot, enrollment, ihsaa class, county, and primary conference. There are six rows of data.\n\nThe claim is about the number of schools located in Greensburg. So, I need to check each row's \"location\" column for the value \"greensburg.\" \n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Eastern Hancock: location is Charlottesville.\n2. Indian Creek: location is Trafalgar.\n3. Knightstown: location is Knightstown.\n4. Milan: location is Milan.\n5. North Decatur: location is Greensburg.\n6. South Decatur: location is Greensburg.\n\nSo, rows 4 and 5 (0-based index would be 4 and 5?) Wait, no, let me count correctly. Actually, in programming, arrays are zero-indexed, so the first row is index 0.\n\nWait, the data array starts with index 0 as Eastern Hancock, then 1: Indian Creek, 2: Knightstown, 3: Milan, 4: North Decatur, 5: South Decatur. So North Decatur is at index 4 and South Decatur at index 5. Both have location Greensburg.\n\nThat means there are two schools with location Greensburg. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.

The claim is: \"north decatur have an enrollment that be 81 student higher than south decatur.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It mentions two schools, North Decatur and South Decatur, and it's comparing their enrollments. Specifically, it claims that North Decatur has 81 more students enrolled than South Decatur.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided in JSON format, I see that there are several columns: school, location, mascot, enrollment, ihsaa class, county, and primary conference. The relevant column here is \"enrollment\" since that's what the claim is about.\n\nNext, I need to find the rows corresponding to North Decatur and South Decatur. Scanning through the data array:\n\n- The fifth row (index 4) has \"north decatur\" as the school.\n- The sixth row (index 5) has \"south decatur\" as the school.\n\nNow, looking at their enrollments:\n\n- North Decatur's enrollment is listed as 397 students.\n- South Decatur's enrollment is listed as 316 students.\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to calculate the difference between these two numbers.

To verify this, I need to look into the table and check how many schools are listed with Greensburg as their location.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a school with various details. The columns include \"school\", \"location\", \"mascot\", etc. So, the key column here is \"location\".\n\nI'll go through each row to see which schools have Greensburg as their location.\n\nRow 0: Eastern Hancock - Location is Charlottesville.\nRow 1: Indian Creek - Location is Trafalgar.\nRow 2: Knightstown - Location is Knightstown.\nRow 3: Milan - Location is Milan.\nRow 4: North Decatur - Location is Greensburg.\nRow 5: South Decatur - Location is Greensburg.\n\nWait, so only two schools are in Greensburg: North Decatur and South Decatur. Indian Creek isn't located there; it's in Trafalgar. Therefore, the claim that Indian Creek is one of three schools in Greensburg is false because there are only two schools listed as being in Greensburg, and Indian Creek isn't among them.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE.

The table has columns: school, location, mascot, enrollment, ihsaa class, county, and primary conference. There are six rows of data corresponding to different schools.\n\nThe claim states that all the schools listed have their primary conference as \"mid - hoosier.\" So my job is to check each row's value under the \"primary conference\" column and see if they're all equal to that specific string.\n\nLooking at the first row, the school is Eastern Hancock. The primary conference here is indeed \"mid  - hoosier.\" Okay, that matches.\n\nNext is Indian Creek. Their primary conference is also listed as \"mid  - hoosier.\" So far, so good.\n\nKnightstown's primary conference is \"mid  - hoosier\" too. Still matching the claim.\n\nNow, Milan's primary conference is different\u2014it says \"ohio river valley.\" Hmm, that doesn't match. This might be a problem because the claim says all schools have \"mid  - hoosier\" as their primary conference. Since one school deviates, this could make the entire claim false.\n\nContinuing on, North Decatur's primary conference is \"mid  - hoosier.\" That fits again.\n\nSouth Decatur also has \"mid  - hoosier\" as their primary conference. So that's a match too.\n\nWait, so out of six schools, five have the primary conference as \"mid  - hoosier,\" but Milan does not. Therefore, the claim isn't entirely true because at least one school doesn't meet the condition.\n\nSo to determine the answer: since all except one meet the condition, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant for this determination. The relevant information comes from each row's \"primary conference\" column.

Looking through the rows, I see:\n\n- Row 4 has \"north decatur\" under the school column.\n- Row 3 has \"milan\" under the school column.\n\nNow, for both of these schools, I need to check their primary conference. The relevant column here is \"primary conference\". Let's extract that information.\n\nFor north decatur (Row 4), the primary conference is listed as \"mid - hoosier\".\nFor milan (Row 3), the primary conference is listed as \"ohio river valley\".\n\nWait a minute, this doesn't match the claim.
