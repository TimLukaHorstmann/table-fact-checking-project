It seems to be stating that Didi Benami sang the song \"angel\" before singing \"lean on me.\" So I need to check if both songs were performed by her and in what order.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a performance with details like week, theme, song choice, original artist, order, and result. \n\nI'll start by checking which rows have \"angel\" as the song choice. Scanning through the data, I see that in row 3 (index starting from 0), the song is \"angel\" by Sarah McLachlan. The week for this performance was \"hollywood,\" and the order is marked as \"n/a.\"\n\nNext, I check for \"lean on me.\" In row 4, the song is \"lean on me\" by Bill Withers, performed in the \"top 20 (10 women)\" week with an order of 5. \n\nNow, I need to see if both these songs were sung by Didi Benami. However, looking at the table, there's no information about who the performer is\u2014only the original artist and the song choice are listed. There\u2019s no column for the performer's name or any mention of Didi Benami in the data provided.\n\nSince the table doesn't include information about who sang each song, I can't confirm if Didi Benami was the one who performed either \"angel\" or \"lean on me.\" Without this information, the claim can't be verified. \n\nTherefore, based on the available data, the claim is not supported and should be marked as FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table lacks information about the performers of each song, so it's impossible to confirm if Didi Benami sang either \"angel\" or \"lean on me.\" Thus, the claim cannot be validated.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"no one be not the last song choice for didi benami\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It seems a bit awkwardly phrased, but I think it's trying to say that \"No One\" was not the last song choice for Didi Benami. Alternatively, maybe it's suggesting that \"no one\" (meaning nobody) made \"the last song choice for Didi Benami.\" Hmm, that could be a bit confusing.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to see if there's any information about someone named Didi Benami and whether their last song choice was \"No One\" or not. Let me scan through the data provided.\n\nThe table has columns: week, theme, song choice, original artist, order, result. Looking at each row:\n\n1. The first four rows are from audition weeks (audition, hollywood) with various songs.\n2. Then we have \"top 24\" onwards, which seems to be later rounds in a competition.\n\nNowhere do I see the name Didi Benami mentioned. All the entries under \"song choice\" don't include any indication of who chose them beyond the original artists and themes. The table doesn't list contestants or participants, so there's no mention of Didi Benami at all.\n\nSince Didi Benami isn't in the table, we can't verify anything about their song choices. Therefore, the claim can't be supported by the data provided because there's no relevant information to check against.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the answer should be FALSE because the necessary details aren't present in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to Didi Benami and her last song choice being \"No One.\" However, the table doesn't mention Didi Benami at all. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the given data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table in JSON format and a specific claim about the data within that table. My goal is to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information given.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"didi benami be number 5 in order for both week top 20 (10 women) and top 16 (8 women)\". So, the claim is stating that Didi Benami was ranked #5 in two different weeks\u2014Top 20 (10 Women) and Top 16 (8 Women). \n\nLooking at the table structure, I see the columns are \"week\", \"theme\", \"song choice\", \"original artist\", \"order\", and \"result\". The key columns here are \"week\" and \"order\" since we're dealing with rankings over different weeks.\n\nI'll start by examining each row in the data to find instances where the week is either \"top 20 (10 women)\" or \"top 16 (8 women)\". \n\nLooking at the rows:\n- Row index 4: Week \"top 24 (12 women)\", order 9. Not relevant.\n- Row index 5: Week \"top 20 (10 women)\", order 5. This matches one part of the claim.\n- Row index 6: Week \"top 16 (8 women)\", order 5. This also matches the second part.\n\nSo, both weeks mentioned in the claim have an order value of 5. However, I need to ensure that these correspond to Didi Benami's performance. The table doesn't list the contestants' names but only the song choices and original artists. \n\nSince there's no information about who performed which song, we can't confirm if it was indeed Didi Benami in both weeks. Without her name or any contestant details, the claim can't be verified.\n\nTherefore, based on the available data, the claim isn't supported because we don't have evidence linking Didi Benami to those specific order positions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"order\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"order\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the way i am be one of 3 song choice with the theme billboard hot 100 hit.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down what this claim is stating. It seems like it's saying that \"The Way I Am\" is one of three songs chosen under the theme \"Billboard Hot 100 Hits.\" So, I need to check two things: \n\n1. Is there a song named \"The Way I Am\" in the table?\n2. How many songs have the theme \"Billboard Hot 100 Hits\"?\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\nRow 4 has:\n- Theme: billboard hot 100 hits\n- Song choice: the way i am\n\nSo, yes, that's one song.\n\nNow, checking other rows with the same theme. \n\nRow 5:\n- Theme: billboard hot 100 hits\n- Song choice: lean on me\n\nRow 6:\n- Theme: billboard hot 100 hits\n- Song choice: rhiannon\n\nSo there are three songs under \"Billboard Hot 100 Hits\": \"The Way I Am,\" \"Lean On Me,\" and \"Rhiannon.\" \n\nTherefore, the claim is correct.

The claim is: \"terrified be one of the song she sing in the week with a hollywood theme.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse the claim correctly. It seems there might be a typo; probably it should say \"sang\" instead of \"sing,\" but I'll proceed as is. The claim is stating that \"terrified\" was one of the songs she sang during a week with the Hollywood theme.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find rows where the 'theme' column includes 'hollywood.' Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Week is \"audition\", Theme is \"auditioner's choice\". So this isn't hollywood. Song is \"hey jude\".\n\nRow 1: Week is \"hollywood\", Theme is \"first solo\". The song here is \"terrified\" by Katharine McPhee. This fits because the theme includes 'hollywood'.\n\nRows 2 and 3 also have week as \"hollywood\": row 2 has theme \"group performance\" with song \"no one,\" and row 3 has theme \"second solo\" with song \"angel.\" So these are other songs from hollywood weeks.\n\nNow, the claim says that \"terrified\" was sung in a hollywood-themed week. From row 1, we can see that's correct because it's under the hollywood week with the first solo theme.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 1, column \"theme\": to confirm the week is hollywood.\n- Row 1, column \"song choice\": to confirm the song is \"terrified.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the claim mentions two songs: \"no one\" and \"hey jude.\" The phrase seems to suggest that didi benami sang \"no one\" before she sang \"hey jude.\" So, my task is to check if there's a performer named didi benami in the table who performed these songs in that specific order.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a performance with details like week, theme, song choice, original artist, order, and result. The columns are: week, theme, song choice, original artist, order, result.\n\nI'll start by checking if \"didi benami\" is listed as an original artist or perhaps in the 'theme' column since the performer's name might be mentioned there. Scanning through the rows:\n\n1. The first row has \"auditioner's choice\" as the theme and \"hey jude\" as the song.\n2. The second row mentions \"katharine mcphee\" as the original artist for \"terrified.\"\n3. The third row lists \"no one\" by Alicia Keys.\n4. The fourth row is \"angel\" by Sarah McLachlan.\n\nI don't see \"didi benami\" mentioned anywhere in these rows. The original artists are listed as The Beatles, Katharine McPhee, Alicia Keys, and Sarah McLachlan, among others. There's no indication that didi benami performed either song.\n\nAdditionally, the order of performances isn't clear for a single performer since each row seems to represent different weeks or stages in a competition. Without any mention of didi benami, I can't verify her performing \"no one\" before \"hey jude.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the claim doesn't hold up because there's no data about didi benami singing these songs.

So, each row represents a different week with specific details about performances.\n\nThe claim mentions \"didi benami\" but I don't see any entries in the table that mention this name. That's odd because without her name present, it's hard to verify her position. Maybe she didn't make it past certain rounds or isn't listed here? Or perhaps there's a typo in her name?\n\nNext, the claim says she was number 4 in order for both weeks: top 20 (10 women) and top 16 (8 women). Let me check those two specific weeks.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\nRow 4 is \"top 24 (12 women)\" with an order of 9, but that's not relevant. Then row 5 is \"top 20 (10 women)\", which has a song choice of \"lean on me\" by Bill Withers and order number 5. Row 6 is \"top 16 (8 women)\" with \"rhiannon\" by Fleetwood Mac, order 5 again.\n\nWait, both these rows have order number 5, not 4. So the claim says she was number 4 in both, but the table shows that the relevant weeks have order numbers as 5. Therefore, if didi benami were to be number 4, it's not reflected here because those positions are already taken by others.\n\nSince there's no entry for \"didi benami\" and the order numbers for top 20 and top 16 don't include 4 but have 5 instead, the claim isn't supported.
