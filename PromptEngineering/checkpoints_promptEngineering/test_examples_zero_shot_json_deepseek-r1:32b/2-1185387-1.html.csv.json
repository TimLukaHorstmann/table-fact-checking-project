    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the pasl - pro league lose the semifinal game in the playoff\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: year, league, reg season, playoffs, and avg attendance. The data spans from 2005-2006 to 2010-2011.\n\nThe claim mentions the \"pasl - pro\" league losing in the semifinals during the playoffs. So I need to check if there's a row where the league is \"pasl - pro\" and the playoffs result includes \"lost semifinal\".\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. The first three rows are from the \"misl ii\" league, so they can be ignored.\n2. Row 3 (index 3): League is \"pasl - pro\", playoffs result is \"won championship\". That's not a loss in the semifinals.\n3. Row 4 (index 4): League is \"pasl - pro\", playoffs result is \"lost semifinal\". This matches the claim exactly.\n4. Row 5 (index 5): Again, \"pasl - pro\" but playoffs result is \"did not qualify\".\n\nSo the relevant row is index 4 where the league is \"pasl - pro\" and they lost in the semifinals. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I'll note the relevant cells: for row index 4, both the \"league\" column and the \"playoffs\" column are important because they confirm the league and the outcome respectively.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"playoffs\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"the 6th misl , 10 - 20 , 6th misl , 7 - 23 , 8th misl , 11 - 19 , and the 1st western , 12 - 4 regular season have an average attendance of 2358 or higher.\"\n\nSo, the claim is listing four specific \"reg season\" entries from the table and stating that each of these has an average attendance of at least 2358.\n\nLet me look at the table structure. The columns are: year, league, reg season, playoffs, avg attendance. Each row represents a different season.\n\nNow, I'll go through each part of the claim:\n\n1. \"6th misl , 10 - 20\": Looking at the data rows, this is in the first row (row index 0) under \"reg season\". The corresponding \"avg attendance\" is 3170.\n2. \"6th misl , 7 - 23\": This should be the second row (index 1). Its avg attendance is 3612.\n3. \"8th misl , 11 - 19\": That's the third row (index 2), with an attendance of 5095.\n4. \"1st western , 12 - 4\": This is in the fourth row (index 3). The avg attendance here is 2358.\n\nThe claim says that all these have an average attendance of 2358 or higher. So, let's check each value:\n\n- 3170: yes, above 2358.\n- 3612: also above.\n- 5095: definitely above.\n- 2358: exactly the threshold.\n\nAll four values meet or exceed 2358. So the claim is true.\n\nNow, I need to list the relevant cells that were checked. These are the \"avg attendance\" columns for each of these rows (indices 0,1,2,3). The column name is \"avg attendance\".\n\nSo the relevant_cells should include four objects: each with their respective row indices and the column name.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are as listed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"avg attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"avg attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"avg attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"avg attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table in JSON format. The claim is: \"the 4th western , 5 - 10 season have an average attendance more than 942.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what the claim is saying. It's referring to a specific season described as \"4th western , 5 - 10\" and stating that its average attendance was more than 942. My goal is to check this against the data provided.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are: year, league, reg season, playoffs, avg attendance. Each row corresponds to a different year or season. I need to find the row where \"reg season\" matches \"4th western , 5 - 10.\"\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. The first three rows (2005-2006 to 2007-2008) are under the league \"misl ii.\" Their reg seasons don't match \"4th western , 5 - 10,\" so I can skip these.\n\n2. The fourth row is for 2008-2009, league \"pasl - pro,\" reg season \"1st western , 12 - 4.\" Doesn't match either.\n\n3. The fifth row (2009-2010) has a reg season of \"2nd western , 12 - 4.\" Still not matching.\n\n4. The sixth row, which is index 5 in zero-based indexing, is for the 2010-2011 season. Its reg season is listed as \"4th western , 5 - 10,\" which matches exactly what the claim refers to. \n\nNow, looking at the avg attendance column for this row: it's 721. The claim says that the average attendance was more than 942. But according to the table, it's only 721, which is less than 942.\n\nSo, the relevant cell here is in row index 5 under \"avg attendance.\" Since 721 is not more than 942, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"avg attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: It states that certain specific \"reg season\" entries have an average attendance smaller than 3170. The entries mentioned are:\n\n- \"6th misl , 10 - 20\"\n- \"6th misl , 7 - 23\"\n- \"8th misl , 11 - 19\"\n- \"1st western , 12 - 4\"\n\nI need to check each of these entries against the table and find their corresponding average attendance.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"reg season\" column which contains the format described. Let's go through each entry one by one:\n\n1. **6th misl , 10 - 20**: This is found in row 0 of the data array.\n   - The corresponding average attendance (avg attendance) is 3170.\n\n2. **6th misl , 7 - 23**: This is in row 1.\n   - Average attendance here is 3612.\n\n3. **8th misl , 11 - 19**: Located in row 2.\n   - The avg attendance is 5095.\n\n4. **1st western , 12 - 4**: This appears in row 3.\n   - The average attendance here is 2358.\n\nNow, the claim says that all these entries have an average attendance smaller than 3170. Let's check each value:\n\n- Row 0: 3170 \u2192 Not smaller than 3170; it's equal.\n- Row 1: 3612 \u2192 Larger than 3170.\n- Row 2: 5095 \u2192 Also larger.\n- Row 3: 2358 \u2192 This is indeed smaller than 3170.\n\nHowever, since some of the entries (rows 0, 1, and 2) do not meet the condition (their average attendance is equal to or greater than 3170), the entire claim isn't fully supported. The presence of these rows means the claim isn't entirely true as all specified reg seasons don't have avg attendances below 3170.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"avg attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"avg attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"avg attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"avg attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
