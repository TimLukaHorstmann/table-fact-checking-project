    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"in 1975, the denver bronco never have more than 2 win in a row\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that during the 1975 season, Denver Broncos didn't have three consecutive wins at any point; their maximum consecutive wins were two.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a week in the season with details like opponent, result, game site, and record. The key columns here are \"week\", \"result\", and \"record\". \n\nI'll go through each week's results to see if there are three wins in a row.\n\nStarting from Week 1: They won against the Kansas City Chiefs (Result: W 37-33). So that's one win.\n\nWeek 2: Another win against Green Bay Packers (W 23-13). Now they have two consecutive wins.\n\nWeek 3: They lost to the Buffalo Bills (L 14-38). The losing streak breaks any chance of a three-game winning streak here.\n\nMoving on, in Week 5, after a couple more losses and a win in Week 6 against Cleveland Browns (W 16-15), but that's only one game. Then they lost the next two games: Week 7 and Week 8.\n\nIn Week 9, they won again against San Diego Chargers (W 27-17). So that's another single win without a consecutive streak after previous losses.\n\nWeek 10 was a loss, then in Week 11 they won in overtime (W 13-10 OT), which is the first game. Then Week 12 was a loss again. \n\nLooking at all weeks, I don't see any instance where they had three wins in a row. The maximum consecutive wins were two times.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be TRUE because they never achieved more than two consecutive wins in that season.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"the lowest attendance for at denver bronco game in 1975 be at the san diego stadium.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The key points are:\n1. Lowest attendance.\n2. Denver Broncos game (so games where they were playing).\n3. In 1975.\n4. The lowest attendance was at San Diego Stadium.\n\nWait, looking at the table provided, all the games seem to be for the Denver Broncos since it's about their opponents and results. So each row represents a Denver Bronco game in some year, probably 1975 as per the claim.\n\nLooking at the \"attendance\" column, I need to find which game had the lowest attendance. Let me list out the attendances:\n\nRow 0: 51858\nRow 1: 52621\nRow 2: 79864\nRow 3: 49169\nRow 4: 52590\nRow 5: 70043\nRow 6: 52505\nRow 7: 49919\nRow 8: 26048 (San Diego Stadium)\nRow 9: 28686\nRow 10: 44982\nRow 11: 51075\nRow 12: 36860\nRow 13: 43064\n\nLooking for the lowest number here. The smallest I see is 26048 in row 8, which took place at San Diego Stadium on November 16 against the San Diego Chargers. So that's the game with the lowest attendance.\n\nSo the claim says the lowest was at San Diego Stadium, which matches the data. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table as row 8 shows the lowest attendance at San Diego Stadium.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"in 1975, the most points the Denver Broncos scored in a loss was 21\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim requires:\n\n1. **Year**: The claim mentions 1975. I need to check if all entries in the table are from 1975. However, looking at the \"date\" column, the dates range from September 21st to December 20th, but the year isn't specified anywhere. Since the problem doesn't provide a year, I'll assume all games are from 1975 as per the claim.\n\n2. **Denver Broncos as the team**: The table's data shows entries like \"kansas city chiefs\", \"green bay packers\", etc., under the \"opponent\" column. It also mentions \"mile high stadium,\" which is Denver's home stadium, so I can infer these are Denver Broncos' games.\n\n3. **Losses and Points Scored**: The claim says the most points scored in a loss was 21. So I need to look for all rows where the result is a loss (\"L\") and find the highest points they scored in those losses.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Result \"W 37 - 33\" \u2192 Win, so not relevant.\n- Row 1: Result \"W 23 - 13\" \u2192 Win, irrelevant.\n- Row 2: Result \"L 14 - 38\" \u2192 Loss. Denver scored 14 points here.\n- Row 3: Result \"L 9 - 20\" \u2192 Loss. Denver scored 9 points.\n- Row 4: Result \"W 16 - 15\" \u2192 Win, irrelevant.\n- Row 5: Result \"L 13 - 26\" \u2192 Loss. Denver scored 13 points.\n- Row 6: Result \"L 17 - 42\" \u2192 Loss. Denver scored 17 points.\n- Row 7: Result \"L 16 - 17\" \u2192 Loss. Denver scored 16 points.\n- Row 8: Result \"W 27 - 17\" \u2192 Win, irrelevant.\n- Row 9: Result \"L 21 - 35\" \u2192 Loss. Denver scored 21 points here.\n- Row 10: Result \"W 13 - 10 (OT)\" \u2192 Win, irrelevant.\n- Row 11: Result \"L 10 - 17\" \u2192 Loss. Denver scored 10 points.\n- Row 12: Result \"W 25 - 10\" \u2192 Win, irrelevant.\n- Row 13: Result \"L 13 - 14\" \u2192 Loss. Denver scored 13 points.\n\nNow, compiling all the points in losses:\n- 14, 9, 13, 17, 16, 21, 10, 13.\n\nThe highest among these is 21 points from row 9 where they lost to Atlanta Falcons with a score of 21 - 35. \n\nSo the claim states that the most points scored in a loss was 21, which matches exactly what's found in row 9. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells are in row 9 under \"result\" and perhaps also \"opponent\", but since the question only asks about points scored (which comes from the result string), so just the \"result\" column is relevant for each loss.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"in 1975, the denver bronco go in overtime only 1 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that during the 1975 season, the Denver Broncos had only one game that went into overtime. So, my goal is to check how many games the Broncos played in overtime according to the table and see if it's exactly one.\n\nLooking at the JSON data provided, I can see that there are multiple entries under \"result\" which might indicate whether a game was decided by overtime or not. The columns we're interested in are \"week\", \"date\", \"opponent\", \"result\", \"game site\", \"record\", and \"attendance\".\n\nI'll go through each row of data to check the \"result\" column for any indication of overtime. In sports like football, a game that goes into overtime might have the notation \"(OT)\" or similar in the result.\n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n\n1. Week 1: Result is \"w 37 - 33\" \u2013 no mention of OT.\n2. Week 2: \"w 23 - 13\" \u2013 same here, nothing about OT.\n3. Week 3: \"l 14 - 38\" \u2013 again, straightforward win/loss without OT.\n\nContinuing down:\n\n4. Week 4: Result is \"l 9 - 20\" \u2013 no OT.\n5. Week 5: \"w 16 - 15\" \u2013 still no OT noted.\n\nMoving further along:\n\n6. Week 6: \"l 13 - 26\" \u2013 nothing about OT here either.\n7. Week 7: \"l 17 - 42\" \u2013 same result pattern, no indication of overtime.\n8. Week 8: \"l 16 - 17\" \u2013 still no OT.\n\nThen:\n\n9. Week 9: The result is \"w 27 - 17\" \u2013 again, nothing about OT.\n10. Week 10: \"l 21 - 35\" \u2013 same here.\n\nNow looking at Week 11:\n\n- Result is \"w 13 - 10 (OT)\" \u2013 Aha! This indicates that the game went into overtime because of the \"(OT)\" notation. So this is one instance where the Broncos went into OT.\n\nContinuing to check the remaining weeks:\n\n12. Week 12: \"l 10 - 17\" \u2013 No OT here.\n13. Week 13: \"w 25 - 10\" \u2013 Still no mention of OT.\n14. Week 14: \"l 13 - 14\" \u2013 No indication of overtime.\n\nAfter reviewing all the rows, I found only one instance where the result included \"(OT)\", which is in row index 10 (Week 11). Therefore, according to the table, the Broncos had only one game that went into overtime during the 1975 season. \n\nSo the claim is TRUE because there's exactly one game listed as going into overtime.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 1975, the Denver Broncos played only one game that went into overtime. By examining each row of the table, I identified that the result for Week 11 (row index 10) was \"w 13 - 10 (OT)\", which is the only instance of an overtime game.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"in 1975, the denver bronco finish the season with a loss at the miami orange bowl.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the components of the claim:\n\n1. **Year**: 1975\n2. **Team Name**: Denver Broncos (I notice in the table it's listed as \"denver bronco,\" which is likely a typo but I'll proceed with that.)\n3. **Season Finish**: Loss\n4. **Location**: Miami Orange Bowl\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game from week 1 to week 14. The columns include week number, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance.\n\nI need to check if there's a game where the Denver Broncos (or \"denver bronco\") played in Miami Orange Bowl towards the end of the season, resulting in a loss.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n- Week 14 is the last week listed. The opponent was Miami Dolphins at Miami Orange Bowl. The result was a loss (\"l 13 - 14\"). \n\nSo, the relevant cells are from row index 13 (since rows start at 0). Let's verify which columns are relevant:\n\n- \"opponent\" to confirm it's the Miami Dolphins.\n- \"result\" to check if it was a loss.\n- \"game site\" to ensure it was in Miami Orange Bowl.\n\nAdditionally, since the claim mentions the season ending with this game, checking the record after week 14 (6 - 8) confirms it's the end of the season.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by row 13.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"In 1975, the Denver Broncos never have more than 1 win in a row\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. The data spans from week 1 to week 14. Each row represents a game played during that week with details about the opponent, result, location, current record after the game, and attendance.\n\nThe claim is about consecutive wins in 1975. So I need to check if there are any instances where the Denver Broncos won two games consecutively (i.e., back-to-back weeks). \n\nI'll start by examining each week's result and see how the team performed sequentially. Let's go through each row:\n\n- Week 1: Result is \"w 37 - 33\" \u2013 a win.\n- Week 2: Result is \"w 23 - 13\" \u2013 another win.\n\nSo weeks 1 and 2 are both wins. That means they had at least two consecutive wins, which would mean the claim that they never have more than one win in a row is FALSE because they achieved two in a row.\n\nTo be thorough, I'll check the rest of the table to see if there are any other instances:\n\n- Week 3: Loss.\n- Week 4: Loss.\n- Week 5: Win. Now, was the previous week a loss? Yes, so no consecutive wins here.\n- Week 6: Loss.\n- Week 7: Loss.\n- Week 8: Loss.\n- Week 9: Win. Previous week was a loss, so no consecutive wins.\n- Week 10: Loss.\n- Week 11: Win (OT). Previous week was a loss, so still single win streak.\n- Week 12: Loss.\n- Week 13: Win. Previous week was a loss.\n- Week 14: Loss.\n\nSo the only instance of multiple consecutive wins is weeks 1 and 2. Therefore, the claim that they never had more than one win in a row is FALSE because there's at least one occurrence where they won two games consecutively.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells that support this conclusion. The results for week 1 and week 2 are crucial here:\n\n- Week 1 result: \"w 37 - 33\" (row index 0, column \"result\").\n- Week 2 result: \"w 23 - 13\" (row index 1, column \"result\").\n\nThese two cells show consecutive wins, which directly contradicts the claim.

The claim is: \"the lowest attendance for at denver bronco game in 1975 be at the mile high stadium.\"\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It states two things:\n1. The lowest attendance at a Denver Broncos game in 1975 was at Mile High Stadium.\n2. We need to check if this is true based on the provided table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week with details like date, opponent, result, etc. The relevant columns here are \"game site\" and \"attendance.\" \n\nI'll go through each row to find where the game site is Mile High Stadium and note their attendance numbers. Then, I'll check if any other games (not at Mile High) had lower attendance.\n\nRows with \"Mile High Stadium\" as the game site:\n- Week 1: Attendance 51,858\n- Week 2: Attendance 52,621\n- Week 5: Attendance 52,590\n- Week 7: Attendance 52,505\n- Week 8: Attendance 49,919 (Wait, this is lower than the others)\n- Week 13: Attendance 36,860\n\nRows not at Mile High Stadium:\n- Week 3: Rich Stadium, Attendance 79,864\n- Week 4: Three Rivers Stadium, Attendance 49,169 (Lower than some Mile High games)\n- Week 6: Arrowhead Stadium, Attendance 70,043\n- Week 9: San Diego Stadium, Attendance 26,048 (This is the lowest attendance overall)\n- Week 10: Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, Attendance 28,686\n- Week 12: Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, Attendance 51,075\n\nSo, looking at all attendances:\n- The lowest was 26,048 (Week 9) at San Diego Stadium.\n- Next lowest at Mile High is 36,860 in Week 13.\n\nSince the claim says the lowest attendance was at Mile High, but actually the lowest was elsewhere, the claim is FALSE.

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions the year 1975. I'm not seeing any data about the year in the columns provided. The table's columns are \"week,\" \"date,\" \"opponent,\" \"result,\" \"game site,\" \"record,\" and \"attendance.\" There's no \"year\" column here. So, I need to assume that all these games took place in 1975 since the claim is about that year.\n\nNext, the claim refers to \"the most points the Denver Broncos score in a loss.\" So, I'm looking for games where the Broncos lost and their score was 15 or higher. But wait, actually, it's saying the most points they scored in any loss during 1975 is 15. That means I need to check all the losses (where the result starts with 'l') and see what the highest points they scored were.\n\nLooking at the \"result\" column for each row:\n\nRow 0: W 37-33 \u2013 a win, so not relevant.\nRow 1: W 23-13 \u2013 another win, still no loss here.\nRow 2: L 14-38 \u2013 a loss.

Broncos scored 13 points.\nRow 6: L 17-42 \u2013 loss; they scored 17.\nRow 7: L 16-17 \u2013 loss with 16 points.\nRow 8: W 27-17 \u2013 a win, so ignore.\nRow 9: L 21-35 \u2013 loss. They scored 21 here, which is higher than the previous losses except for row 6 where they had 17.\nWait, in row 6, they lost but scored 17 points. Then in row 9, they lost and scored 21. Hmm, so that's even more.\n\nRow 10: W 13-10 (OT) \u2013 a win via overtime, so not relevant.\nRow 11: L 10-17 \u2013 loss with only 10 points.\nRow 12: W 25-10 \u2013 another win.\nRow 13: L 13-14 \u2013 loss. They scored 13 points.\n\nSo, looking at all the losses, their scores were:\nRow 2: 14\nRow 3: 9\nRow 5:13\nRow6:17\nRow7:16\nRow9:21\nRow11:10\nRow13:13\n\nSo the highest points they scored in a loss was 21, which is higher than 15. Therefore, the claim that the most points were 15 is incorrect because there's at least one game (row9) where they lost but scored 21.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"the most points... score in a loss be 15.\" So if any of their losses had them scoring more than 15, then the claim is false because it's not 15 as the maximum. Since they have games where they scored 17, 21, etc., which are higher than 15, that makes the claim false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 1975, Denver Broncos' highest score in a loss was 15 points. Reviewing the data, there are multiple instances where they scored more than 15 in losses (e.g., 21 points). Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says: \"in 1975, the denver bronco go in overtime only 2 time.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what this means. It seems like it's talking about Denver Broncos football games in the 1975 season where they went into overtime. Specifically, the claim is that there were only two such instances.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a game with details like week, date, opponent, result, and so on. The columns we're interested in are \"result\" because it tells us if a game was decided in overtime or not.\n\nI'll go through each row to check for any games that went into overtime. \n\n- Row 0: Result is \"w 37 - 33\". No indication of overtime here.\n- Row 1: \"w 23 - 13\". Straightforward win, no OT.\n- Row 2: \"l 14 - 38\". Loss, but not an overtime game.\n- Row 3: \"l 9 - 20\". Another loss without OT.\n- Row 4: \"w 16 - 15\". This is a close win, but does it mention OT? The result here ends with the score, no indication of overtime. So probably not OT.\n- Row 5: \"l 13 - 26\". Loss, not OT.\n- Row 6: \"l 17 - 42\". Again, a loss without OT.\n- Row 7: \"l 16 - 17\". This is a very close loss. The score is 16-17. It doesn't specify if this was in regulation or overtime. Since it's just the final score, I can't be certain if it went to OT unless there's an indication in the result.\n- Row 8: \"w 27 - 17\". Straightforward win, no OT mentioned.\n- Row 9: \"l 21 - 35\". Loss without OT.\n- Row 10: \"w 13 - 10 (ot)\". Here's one! The result explicitly mentions \"(ot)\", so this is an overtime game. So that's the first instance.\n- Row 11: \"l 10 - 17\". Loss, no OT.\n- Row 12: \"w 25 - 10\". Win without OT.\n- Row 13: \"l 13 - 14\". Another close loss. The score is 13-14. It doesn't specify OT here either.\n\nWait a minute, in row 7, the result was a loss by one point (16-17). I'm not sure if that necessarily means it went to overtime because sometimes games can end on regulation time with such scores. However, without an \"(ot)\" notation, I can't confirm it as an OT game.\n\nSo from this table, only row 10 has a result marked with (ot), indicating an overtime game. That's just one instance, not two. Therefore, the claim that they went into overtime twice in 1975 is false based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there were two overtime games for the Denver Broncos in 1975. Upon examining the table, only row 10 indicates an overtime game with \"(ot)\" noted. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"in 1975, the denver bronco finish the season with a win at the miami orange bowl.\"\n\nFirst, I should check if there's any mention of the year in the table. Looking through the data, each row represents a week of games but doesn't specify the year. The dates range from September to December, but no specific year is provided. So, I can't confirm that these games took place in 1975 based on this table.\n\nNext, I need to verify if Denver Broncos finished the season with a win at Miami Orange Bowl. Looking through each row:\n\n- Week 14 (row index 13) shows an opponent named \"miami dolphins\" played at \"miami orange bowl.\" The result was \"l 13 - 14,\" which indicates a loss.\n\nSince this is the last game of the season, and they lost that game, the claim about finishing with a win there isn't correct. Additionally, without confirmation of the year being 1975, I can't fully support the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe table doesn't specify the year, so we can't confirm it's 1975. The last game at Miami Orange Bowl was a loss.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Check for Year Mention:** The table lacks any year information, making it impossible to confirm if events were in 1975.\n2. **Identify Season Finish Game:** Week 14 (row 13) is the last game listed, played against Miami Dolphins at Miami Orange Bowl.\n3. **Determine Outcome:** The result was a loss (\"l 13 - 14\"), contradicting the claim of finishing with a win.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
