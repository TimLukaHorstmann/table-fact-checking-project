    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"when new york be the opponent, the score be 111 - 106\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the table. The columns are: game, date, opponent, score, location / attendance, and record. Each row represents a specific game with details filled under these columns.\n\nThe claim states that when the opponent is \"new york,\" the score was 111-106. So, I need to check each row where the opponent is \"new york\" and see if the corresponding score matches this.\n\nLooking through the data rows:\n\nRow indices go from 0 to 23 (since there are 24 games listed). Let's scan each row's 'opponent' column for \"new york.\"\n\n- Row 17: Opponent is \"milwaukee,\" not relevant.\n- Row 18: Opponent is \"new york.\" The score here is \"111 - 106.\" This matches the claim exactly.\n\nSince there's only one occurrence of \"new york\" as the opponent, and in that case, the score was indeed 111-106, the claim holds true. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE. The relevant cell is in row 18 under 'opponent' and 'score.'\n\nSo, compiling this into the required JSON format with the answer and the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"alexander memorial coliseum be the location of the game with a score of 113 - 106.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim correctly. It seems like it's saying that Alexander Memorial Coliseum was the location where the game ended with a score of 113-106. So, I need to check if there's any row in the table where both the location is \"alexander memorial coliseum\" and the score is \"113 - 106.\"\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are: game, date, opponent, score, location / attendance, record.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if it matches these two conditions. \n\nStarting from the first row (index 0): The score is 109-105, and the location is Alexander Memorial Coliseum. Doesn't match the score we're looking for.\n\nRow 4 (index 4) has a score of 113-106. Let me check the location here: it's also Alexander Memorial Coliseum. So this row meets both conditions.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other rows with that score. Scanning through all the scores:\n\nRow 4 is the only one with 113-106 as the score. All others have different scores. \n\nTherefore, the claim is true because in row 4, the location matches and the score is correct.\n\nI'll note down the relevant cells: for row 4, both \"location / attendance\" and \"score\" columns are relevant since they confirm the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location  / attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"new york be the opponent at the game with a score of 112 - 106.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any mention of 'new york' in the 'opponent' column. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 8: Opponent is \"san francisco.\"\n- Row 9: Opponent is \"boston.\"\n- Row 10: Opponent is \"baltimore.\"\n- Row 11: Opponent is \"san diego.\"\n- Row 12: Opponent is \"san francisco.\"\n- Row 13: Opponent is \"san francisco.\"\n- Row 14: Opponent is \"seattle.\"\n- Row 15: Opponent is \"philadelphia.\"\n- Row 16: Opponent is \"cincinnati.\"\n- Row 17: Opponent is \"milwaukee.\"\n- Row 18: Opponent is \"new york.\" Ah, here we go. So in row 18 (index starting at 0), the opponent is indeed 'new york.'\n\nNext, I need to check if this game had a score of 112 - 106. Looking at the 'score' column for row 18: it's listed as \"111 - 106.\" Hmm, that's close but not exactly what the claim states.\n\nThe claim specifies 112 - 106, but the actual score is 111 - 106. There's a discrepancy in the first number\u2014111 vs. 112. Since the scores don't match, the claim isn't fully supported by the table data.\n\nTherefore, despite 'new york' being an opponent, the score doesn't align with the claim. So, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are where the opponent is \"new york\" and the score is checked against the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"alexander memorial coliseum be the location of the game with a score of 114 - 106\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It's stating that Alexander Memorial Coliseum was where the game with the exact score of 114-106 took place.\n\nLooking at the table, I see multiple entries. The columns are \"game\", \"date\", \"opponent\", \"score\", \"location / attendance\", and \"record\".\n\nI need to find which row(s) have a score of 114 - 106. Scanning through each data entry:\n\n- Row 0: Score is 109 - 105 \u2192 No\n- Row 1: 103 - 123 \u2192 No\n- Row 2: 119 - 140 \u2192 No\n- Row 3: 114 - 101 \u2192 Close, but not 114-106\n- Row 4: 113 - 106 \u2192 No\n- Row 5: 108 - 123 \u2192 No\n- Row 6: 142 - 113 \u2192 No\n- Row 7: 115 - 116 \u2192 No\n- Row 8: 125 - 130 \u2192 No\n- Row 9: 89 - 119 \u2192 No\n- Row 10: 111 - 106 \u2192 Score is 111-106, not matching\n- Row 11: 129 - 121 \u2192 No\n- Row 12: 114 - 96 \u2192 This score has 114, but the second number isn't 106. So no.\nWait, row 3 is game 11, November 8 against San Diego with a score of 114-101 at Alexander Memorial. That's not the score in the claim.\n\nLooking back, perhaps I missed a row? Let me check again.\n\nRow 12: Game 20, November 23 vs Chicago, score is 114 - 96 \u2192 No.\n\nWait, did any game have exactly 114-106?\n\nWait, looking at the data:\n\nRow 17 (index starts from 0?) Wait no, in JSON data it's an array, so index 3 is the fourth row. Let me recount:\n\nIndex 0: Game 8 \u2192 score 109-105\nIndex 1: Game 9 \u2192 103-123\nIndex 2: Game10 \u2192 119-140\nIndex3: Game11 \u2192 114-101\nIndex4: Game12 \u2192 113-106\nWait, row index 4 has a score of 113 - 106. That's not 114-106.\n\nHmm, is there any row with 114-106?\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 5: Game13 \u2192 108-123\nRow 6: Game14 \u2192 142-113\nRow7: Game15 \u2192 115-116\nRow8: Game16 \u2192 125-130\nRow9: Game17 \u2192 89-119\nRow10: Game18 \u2192 111-106\nAh, here's row index 10 (Game18) has a score of 111 - 106. That's not the claim.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go through each row carefully:\n\nRow index 3: Game11 \u2192 Score 114-101\nRow index 4: Game12 \u2192 113-106\n\nSo no game has exactly 114 -106 as the score. Therefore, the claim is false because there's no such score in the table.\n\nWait, but let me check all rows again to be sure:\n\nLooking at row index 4: Game12, opponent Cincinnati, score 113-106 \u2192 not matching.\nRow index 10: Game18 vs Chicago, score 111-106 \u2192 nope.\n\nSo the claim refers to a game with a specific score that doesn't exist in the data. Therefore, it's FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says \"a game with a score of 114 -106.\" Since there is no such score, the location can't be Alexander Memorial Coliseum because the game itself doesn't exist. So the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a specific score that isn't present in the table, so it's false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
