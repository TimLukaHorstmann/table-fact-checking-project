    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format. The claim is: \"pugsley addams be the only role that have 3 people available to play it in the original s\u00e3o paulo cast.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim carefully. It's saying that Pugsley Addams is the only role with three actors in the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast.\n\nLooking at the table structure: The columns are \"role\" and several casts like \"original broadway cast\", \"closing broadway cast\", etc., including \"original s\u00e1o paulo cast\". Each row corresponds to a different character (e.g., Gomez Addams, Morticia Addams, etc.) with their respective cast members.\n\nI need to check each role's entry under the \"original s\u00e1o paulo cast\" column. The goal is to see if any other roles besides Pugsley Addams have three people listed there.\n\nStarting with Pugsley Addams: Looking at row 5 (since rows are zero-indexed, so index 4 in data array?), wait no, let me recount the rows. The first row is Gomez, then Morticia, Uncle Fester, Grandma, Wednesday, Pugsley\u2014so row index for Pugsley should be 5.\n\nIn the \"original s\u00e1o paulo cast\" column (which is the fifth column since columns are ordered as role, original broadway, closing broadway, original US tour, original nonequity tour, original S\u00e3o Paulo, original Lima. So column index is 5? Let me check: columns array is [\"role\", \"original broadway cast\", \"closing broadway cast\", \"original us tour cast\", \"original nonequity tour cast\", \"original s\u00e1o paulo cast\", \"original lima cast\"], so the fifth element (index 4) is original nonequity, then index 5 is S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nSo for Pugsley Addams, row index 5: looking at data[5][5], which should be the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast. The value is \"nicholas torres , gustavo daneluz  , matheus lustosa\". That's three names, separated by commas.\n\nNow I need to check all other roles to see if any have three actors in their original S\u00e3o Paulo cast. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. Gomez Addams: data[0][5] is \"daniel boaventura\" \u2014 one person.\n2. Morticia Addams: data[1][5] is \"marisa orth\" \u2014 one person.\n3. Uncle Fester: data[2][5] is \"claudio galvan\" \u2014 one person.\n4. Grandma Addams: data[3][5] is \"in\u00e1 de carvalho\" \u2014 one person.\n5. Wednesday Addams: data[4][5] is \"laura lobo\" \u2014 one person.\n6. Pugsley Addams: as established, three people.\n7. Lurch: data[6][5] is \"rog\u00e9rio guedes\" \u2014 one person.\n8. Mal Beineke: data[7][5] is \"wellington nogueira\" \u2014 one person.\n9. Alice Beineke: data[8][5] is \"paula capovilla\" \u2014 one person.\n10. Lucas Beineke: data[9][5] is \"beto sargentelli\" \u2014 one person.\n\nWait, no other roles have more than one actor listed in the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast except Pugsley Addams. Therefore, the claim that Pugsley Addams is the only role with three people available to play it in the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"original s\\u00e3o paulo cast\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim \"daniel boaventura be 1 of 6 people who play gomez addams\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has several columns: role, original broadway cast, closing broadway cast, original us tour cast, original nonequity tour cast, original s\u0101o paulo cast, and original lima cast. The data is organized in rows, each representing a different character from the Addams Family.\n\nThe claim mentions Daniel Boaventura playing Gomez Addams as one of six people. So, I need to check how many individuals are listed for the role of Gomez Addams across all relevant casts.\n\nLooking at the first row (row_index 0), which corresponds to \"gomez addams,\" here's what I find:\n\n- **Original broadway cast**: Nathan Lane\n- **Closing broadway cast**: Roger Rees\n- **Original us tour cast**: Douglas Sills\n- **Original nonequity tour cast**: Jesse Sharp\n- **Original s\u0101o paulo cast**: Daniel Boaventura\n- **Original lima cast**: Diego Bertie\n\nSo, counting each entry under Gomez Addams:\n\n1. Nathan Lane (Broadway original)\n2. Roger Rees (Closing Broadway)\n3. Douglas Sills (US Tour)\n4. Jesse Sharp (Nonequity Tour)\n5. Daniel Boaventura (S\u0101o Paulo)\n6. Diego Bertie (Lima)\n\nThat's six distinct actors listed for Gomez Addams. Each of these entries represents a different cast member who played the role in various productions or tours.\n\nDaniel Boaventura is specifically mentioned under the original S\u0101o Paulo cast, which contributes to his being one of the six individuals associated with Gomez Addams across all casts.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Daniel Boaventura is one of six people who have played Gomez Addams holds true based on the data provided in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 0,\n       \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 0,\n       \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 0,\n       \"column_name\": \"original us tour cast\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 0,\n       \"column_name\": \"original nonequity tour cast\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 0,\n       \"column_name\": \"original s\u0101o paulo cast\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 0,\n       \"column_name\": \"original lima cast\"\n     }\n   ]\n}",

I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"adam riegler and zachary james play their same role in both the original broadway cast and the closing broadway cast.\" So, the key points here are that Adam Riegler and Zachary James have roles in both the original Broadway cast and the closing Broadway cast. Their roles should be the same in both casts.\n\nNext, I'll look at the table structure to understand where this information is located. The columns provided are \"role\", \"original broadway cast\", \"closing broadway cast\", \"original us tour cast\", etc. So, for each role, there's a listing of actors under \"original broadway cast\" and \"closing broadway cast\".\n\nNow, I'll search the data for both Adam Riegler and Zachary James.\n\nStarting with Adam Riegler: I scan through the rows until I find his name. Looking at row index 5, which is \"pugsley addams\". Here, in the \"original broadway cast\" column, it's listed as Adam Riegler. In the same row under \"closing broadway cast\", it's also Adam Riegler. So, he played Pugsley Addams in both original and closing casts.\n\nNext, Zachary James: I find him in row index 6, which is \"lurch\".

So, he played Lurch in both casts.\n\nSince both actors have the same role in both original and closing Broadway casts, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because both Adam Riegler and Zachary James are listed under the same roles in both the \"original broadway cast\" and \"closing broadway cast\".\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the original lima cast have 11 people available to play 10 role unlike the original broadway cast which only have 10 people available to play 10 role.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down what's being claimed here. It seems that for each role in the original Lima cast, there are 11 people assigned, but since there are 10 roles, this might imply a surplus of one person. On the other hand, the original Broadway cast has exactly 10 people for 10 roles.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it's organized by rows where each row represents a role and columns represent different casts (like original broadway, original Lima, etc.). Each cell under these columns lists the actors who played that role in the respective cast.\n\nSo I'll need to count how many actors are listed for each role in both the \"original lima cast\" and \"original broadway cast\" columns.\n\nStarting with the original lima cast:\n\n1. Gomez Addams: Diego Bertie \u2192 1 person.\n2. Morticia Addams: Fiorella Rodriguez \u2192 1 person.\n3. Uncle Fester: Nicol\u00e1s Fantinato \u2192 1 person.\n4. Grandma Addams: Patricia Portocarrero \u2192 1 person.\n5. Wednesday Addams: Gina Yangali \u2192 1 person.\n6. Pugsley Addams: Giuseppino Castellano, Brando Gallesi \u2192 2 people.\n7. Lurch: Gustavo Mayer \u2192 1 person.\n8. Mal Beineke: Miguel Alvarez \u2192 1 person.\n9. Alice Beineke: Trilce Cavero \u2192 1 person.\n10. Lucas Beineke: Luis Baca \u2192 1 person.\n\nAdding these up, I get a total of 1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+1+1 = 11 people for the Lima cast across 10 roles. That matches the claim that they have 11 people for 10 roles.\n\nNow checking the original broadway cast:\n\nLooking at each role under \"original broadway cast\":\n\n1. Gomez Addams: Nathan Lane \u2192 1 person.\n2. Morticia Addams: Bebe Neuwirth \u2192 1 person.\n3. Uncle Fester: Kevin Chamberlin \u2192 1 person.\n4. Grandma Addams: Jackie Hoffman \u2192 1 person.\n5. Wednesday Addams: Krysta Rodriguez \u2192 1 person.\n6. Pugsley Addams: Adam Riegler \u2192 1 person.\n7. Lurch: Zachary James \u2192 1 person.\n8. Mal Beineke: Terrence Mann \u2192 1 person.\n9. Alice Beineke: Carolee Carmello \u2192 1 person.\n10. Lucas Beineke: Wesley Taylor \u2192 1 person.\n\nAdding these, each role has exactly one actor, totaling 10 people for 10 roles. So the original broadway cast indeed has 10 people for 10 roles as the claim states.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are accurate: Lima cast has 11 actors for 10 roles, while Broadway has 10 actors for 10 roles.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the original Lima cast lists 11 individuals across 10 roles, whereas the original Broadway cast lists exactly 10 individuals for 10 roles.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"original lima cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table in JSON format and a claim about it. My task is to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"gomez have be play by 8 different actor\". There's a typo here\u2014probably meant \"have been played by 8 different actors.\" So the claim suggests that the character Gomez Addams was portrayed by eight distinct actors across various casts.\n\nNext, I need to examine the table provided. The columns are \"role,\" followed by several cast lists for different productions: original Broadway cast, closing Broadway cast, original US tour cast, and so on. Each row represents a character in the play, with their respective actors listed under each production category.\n\nLooking at the first row of data:\n- Role: Gomez Addams\n- Original Broadway Cast: Nathan Lane\n- Closing Broadway Cast: Roger Rees\n- Original US Tour Cast: Douglas Sills\n- Original Nonequity Tour Cast: Jesse Sharp\n- Original S\u00e3o Paulo Cast: Daniel Boaventura\n- Original Lima Cast: Diego Bertie\n\nSo, for Gomez Addams, there are six actors listed across the different casts. Each of these is a separate production or tour, so each actor would have played Gomez in their respective productions.\n\nNow, I need to count how many distinct actors are listed for Gomez. From the data:\n1. Nathan Lane\n2. Roger Rees\n3. Douglas Sills\n4. Jesse Sharp\n5. Daniel Boaventura\n6. Diego Bertie\n\nThat's six actors total. The claim states that Gomez has been played by eight different actors, but according to this table, it's only six.\n\nI should double-check if there are any other columns or rows I might have missed that could include additional actors for Gomez. Scanning through the rest of the data, each subsequent row pertains to a different character (Morticia Addams, Uncle Fester, etc.), none of which affect Gomez's count.\n\nTherefore, since only six actors are listed and the claim mentions eight, the statement is not supported by the table. The relevant cells are all those under Gomez Addams' row across each column except \"role.\"\n\nSo, compiling the relevant cells:\n- Row index 0 for each cast column: original broadway cast, closing broadway cast, original us tour cast, original nonequity tour cast, original s\u00e3 paulo cast, original lima cast.\n\nThis gives six distinct actors, not eight.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim \"there be 1 season lurch have 3 people available to play\" is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions \"lurch,\" which is a character from The Addams Family. The claim states that in one season, Lurch had three people available to play him. So, I'm looking for whether there are three different actors who played Lurch in any single season.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns like \"original broadway cast,\" \"closing broadway cast,\" etc., along with other tour casts and international casts. The rows list each character and their respective actors across these categories.\n\nI should focus on the row for \"lurch.\" Let's find that in the data array. Scanning through:\n\n- Row 6: \"lurch\" is the role.\n   - Original Broadway cast: Zachary James\n   - Closing Broadway cast: Zachary James\n   - Original US tour cast: Tom corbeil\n   - Original nonequity tour cast: Dan Olson\n   - Original S\u00e3o Paulo cast: Rog\u00e9rio Guedes\n   - Original Lima cast: Gustavo Mayer\n\nSo, for Lurch, the actors listed are:\n1. Zachary James (Broadway)\n2. Tom Corbeil (US Tour)\n3. Dan Olson (nonequity tour)\n4. Rog\u00e9rio Guedes (S\u00e3o Paulo)\n5. Gustavo Mayer (Lima)\n\nWait, that's five different actors across various productions and tours. However, the claim specifically mentions \"1 season.\" I'm not sure if each of these casts represents a different season or just different productions.\n\nIn Broadway shows, sometimes roles are recast between seasons. So, in the original Broadway cast, Zachary James played Lurch, and then he also closed the Broadway run. That might mean he was in multiple seasons. The US tour might be a separate production, possibly in another season, with Tom Corbeil.\n\nBut according to the table, Lurch was played by multiple actors across different casts but not necessarily three in the same season. It seems more like each of these actors represented different productions or tours rather than the same season.\n\nSo, is there any indication that in one particular season (like Season 1), there were three people available? The table doesn't provide information about seasons directly; it just lists casts for original Broadway, closing Broadway, US tour, etc. Without knowing how these correspond to specific seasons, I can't confirm that a single season had three actors for Lurch.\n\nTherefore, the claim might not be supported by the data in the table because it doesn't specify which season and whether there were three different actors in that season.\n</think>\n\nThe claim suggests that in one season, three people played Lurch. The table lists multiple actors across various productions but doesn't indicate they were in the same season.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 6,\n       \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 6,\n       \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 6,\n       \"column_name\": \"original us tour cast\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 6,\n       \"column_name\": \"original nonequity tour cast\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 6,\n       \"column_name\": \"original s\\u00e3o paulo cast\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 6,\n       \"column_name\": \"original lima cast\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

So each row represents a character in the Addams Family, and for each character, there are different casts listed under various tours or locations.\n\nThe claim is about Bebe Neuwirth being part of the original Lima cast. I need to find where she's mentioned in the table.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n- The first row is Gomez Addams, with Nathan Lane in the original Broadway cast and Roger Rees closing. Not relevant.\n- The second row is Morticia Addams. Here, under \"original broadway cast,\" it's Bebe Neuwirth. Now, I need to check if she's listed in the \"original lima cast\" column for this role.\n\nIn the second row (index 1), let's look at each cell:\n- Role: Morticia Addams\n- Original Broadway Cast: Bebe Neuwirth\n- Closing Broadway Cast: Brooke Shields\n- Original US Tour Cast: Sara Gettelfinger\n- Original Nonequity Tour Cast: Keleen Snowgren\n- Original S\u00e3o Paulo Cast: Marisa Orth\n- Original Lima Cast: Fiorella Rodr\u00edguez\n\nSo, the original Lima cast for Morticia Addams is Fiorella Rodr\u00edguez. Bebe Neuwirth isn't listed there; she's only in the Broadway and US Tour casts.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check all rows to make sure she doesn't appear elsewhere as part of the Lima cast? Let me go through each row quickly:\n\nRow 3: Uncle Fester \u2013 Kevin Chamberlin in original Broadway. No mention of Bebe Neuwirth.\nRow 4: Grandma Addams \u2013 Jackie Hoffman, same person in both original and closing. Not relevant.\nRow 5: Wednesday Addams \u2013 Krysta Rodriguez originally, Rachel Potter later. No Bebe.\nRow 6: Pugsley Addams \u2013 Adam Riegler twice, others are different people.\nRow 7: Lurch \u2013 Zachary James, same for original and closing.\nRow 8: Mal Beineke \u2013 Terrence Mann originally, Adam Grupper in closing.\nRow 9: Alice Beineke \u2013 Carolee Carmello originally, Heidi Blickenstaff later.\nRow 10: Lucas Beineke \u2013 Wesley Taylor, Jesse Swenson.\n\nNo other mentions of Bebe Neuwirth anywhere else. So the only time she appears is as the original Broadway cast for Morticia Addams and in the US Tour. The Lima cast is different for that role.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Bebe Neuwirth isn't part of the original Lima cast; Fiorella Rodr\u00edguez is.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 1,\n       \"column_name\": \"original lima cast\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"there be not actor who play the same role in the opening and closing cast\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim means. It says that there are no actors who played the same role in both the original Broadway cast (opening) and the closing Broadway cast. So, for each role, I need to check if any actor from the original cast is also listed in the closing cast.\n\nLooking at the table structure: The columns are \"role\", \"original broadway cast\", \"closing broadway cast\", and others that aren't relevant here since the claim only concerns the Broadway opening and closing casts. \n\nI'll go through each row of data, focusing on the \"original broadway cast\" and \"closing broadway cast\" columns.\n\nLet's start with the first role: Gomez Addams. Original cast is Nathan Lane, closing cast is Roger Rees. Different actors, so no conflict here.\n\nNext, Morticia Addams. Original is Bebe Neuwirth, closing is Brooke Shields. Again, different people.\n\nUncle Fester has Kevin Chamberlin originally and Brad Oscar in the closing. Still no overlap.\n\nGrandma Addams: Jackie Hoffman in both original and closing. Oh, wait! That's a match. So she played the same role in both casts. This would mean that there is at least one actor who did play the same role in opening and closing, which makes the claim FALSE.\n\nWait, let me double-check each row just to be sure I didn't miss any other instances.\n\nWednesday Addams: Krysta Rodriguez originally, Rachel Potter closing. Different actors.\n\nPugsley Addams: Adam Riegler in both original and closing. Another match. So two roles where the same actor was in both casts.\n\nLurch: Zachary James in both. That's a third instance.\n\nMal Beineke: Terrence Mann originally, Adam Grupper closing. No overlap.\n\nAlice Beineke: Carolee Carmello originally, Heidi Blickenstaff closing. Different.\n\nLucas Beineke: Wesley Taylor originally, Jesse Swenson closing. Different.\n\nSo I found that Grandma Addams, Pugsley Addams, and Lurch all have the same actor in both original and closing casts. This means the claim is not true because there are actors who did play the same role in both.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that no actor played the same role in both the opening and closing Broadway casts. By examining each row, we found multiple instances where actors remained in their roles for both casts.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "there be always extra actor available for each role",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be always extra actor available for each role\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table in JSON format. Let me break down what this claim means and how I can verify it using the data provided.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the table. The columns are: \"role\", \"original broadway cast\", \"closing broadway cast\", \"original us tour cast\", \"original nonequity tour cast\", \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\", and \"original lima cast\". Each row represents a different role in what seems to be a play or musical, given the roles like Gomez Addams, Morticia Addams, etc.\n\nThe claim is about whether there's always an extra actor available for each role. I interpret this as checking if each role has more than one listed actor in any of the cast categories. In other words, does every role have at least two actors listed across all the cast columns?\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n1. **Gomez Addams**: The original Broadway cast is Nathan Lane, closing is Roger Rees. So that's two different actors for this role. That seems like an extra.\n\n2. **Morticia Addams**: Original Broadway is Bebe Neuwirth, closing is Brooke Shields. Again, two actors. Extra available.\n\n3. **Uncle Fester**: Kevin Chamberlin in original, Brad Oscar in closing. Two actors here too.\n\n4. **Grandma Addams**: Jackie Hoffman for both original and closing. That's only one actor listed. Wait, does that mean no extra? Because she's the same person in both casts. So maybe not an extra?\n\n5. **Wednesday Addams**: Krysta Rodriguez and Rachel Potter. Two actors.\n\n6. **Pugsley Addams**: Adam Riegler is in both original and closing Broadway cast. But in the US tour, there are three names: Nicholas Torres, Gustavo Daneluz, Matheus Lustosa. So for this role, there's more than one actor across different tours. Does that count as an extra? The claim might consider any additional actors beyond the initial, regardless of the production version.\n\n7. **Lurch**: Zachary James is in both original and closing, but also has Tom Corbeil in US tour, etc. So multiple actors across different casts.\n\n8. **Mal Beineke**: Terrence Mann in original, Adam Grupper in closing. Two actors.\n\n9. **Alice Beineke**: Carolee Carmello originally, Heidi Blickenstaff in closing. Two actors.\n\n10. **Lucas Beineke**: Wesley Taylor and Jesse Swenson. Two actors.\n\nWait, so looking at each role:\n\n- Gomez: 2\n- Morticia: 2\n- Uncle Fester: 2\n- Grandma: only Jackie Hoffman listed for both Broadway casts. The other tours have different actors, but the original and closing Broadway is same person.\n- Wednesday: 2\n- Pugsley: multiple in tour, so more than one overall.\n- Lurch: multiple across casts.\n- Mal: 2\n- Alice: 2\n- Lucas: 2\n\nSo Grandma Addams only has Jackie Hoffman listed for the original and closing Broadway. However, looking at other columns, \"original US tour cast\" is Pippa Pearthree, which is another actor for this role. So does that count? The claim is about having an extra actor available for each role, regardless of the production version.\n\nWait, but in the table, Grandma Addams has Jackie Hoffman in original and closing Broadway. But the US tour cast is a different person: Pippa Pearthree. So that's another actor for Grandma Addams. So she does have multiple actors across different casts. Therefore, each role does have at least two actors listed.\n\nWait no, let me check again. The table has columns for original Broadway, closing Broadway, US tour, nonequity tour, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Lima. For Grandma Addams:\n\n- Original Broadway: Jackie Hoffman\n- Closing Broadway: Jackie Hoffman\n- US tour: Pippa Pearthree\n- Nonequity tour: Amanda Bruton\n- S\u00e3o Paulo: In\u00e1 de Carvalho\n- Lima: Patricia Portocarrero\n\nSo yes, Grandma Addams has multiple actors across different casts. So even though in the original and closing Broadway it's the same person, there are other actors listed for this role in other tours.\n\nWait, but the claim is \"there be always extra actor available for each role\". So if every role has more than one actor listed somewhere in the table, then it's true. But looking back at Grandma Addams, she does have multiple actors across different casts. So that would mean yes, an extra is available.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe not because both Broadway casts are same person, but when considering all columns, each role has multiple actors.\n\nBut let me check each role again:\n\n1. Gomez: 2\n2. Morticia: 2\n3. Uncle Fester: 2\n4. Grandma: multiple (Jackie in Broadway, Pippa in US tour, etc.)\n5. Wednesday: 2\n6. Pugsley: multiple\n7. Lurch: multiple\n8. Mal: 2\n9. Alice: 2\n10. Lucas: 2\n\nSo all roles have more than one actor listed across the different cast categories.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check Grandma Addams again. In original Broadway and closing Broadway, it's the same person. But in US tour, it's Pippa Pearthree, so that's another actor. So even if the main Broadway casts are same, other tours have different actors, which means extra actors exist for each role.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because every role has at least two actors listed across different cast categories.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"there be always extra actor available for each role\" is verified by checking if each role in the table has more than one actor listed across all cast columns. Upon examination:\n\n- **Gomez Addams**: Nathan Lane (original) and Roger Rees (closing). Two actors.\n- **Morticia Addams**: Bebe Neuwirth (original) and Brooke Shields (closing). Two actors.\n- **Uncle Fester**: Kevin Chamberlin (original) and Brad Oscar (closing). Two actors.\n- **Grandma Addams**: Jackie Hoffman in Broadway, Pippa Pearthree in US tour. Multiple actors.\n- **Wednesday Addams**: Krysta Rodriguez and Rachel Potter. Two actors.\n- **Pugsley Addams**: Adam Riegler in Broadway, multiple others in other tours. Multiple actors.\n- **Lurch**: Zachary James (Broadway), Tom Corbeil (US tour). Multiple actors.\n- **Mal Beineke**: Terrence Mann (original) and Adam Grupper (closing). Two actors.\n- **Alice Beineke**: Carolee Carmello (original) and Heidi Blickenstaff (closing). Two actors.\n- **Lucas Beineke**: Wesley Taylor and Jesse Swenson. Two actors.\n\nEach role has at least two actors listed across different casts, confirming the claim is TRUE.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is TRUE because each role has multiple actors listed across various cast categories, indicating an extra actor is available for every role.",
