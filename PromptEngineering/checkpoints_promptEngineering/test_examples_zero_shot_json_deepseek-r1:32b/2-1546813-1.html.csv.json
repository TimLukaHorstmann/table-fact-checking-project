It says that from 1990 through 2013, the Solheim Cup was hosted in the US seven times.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year and includes information about where it was held. The relevant columns here are \"year\" and \"venue\". I need to check for each year between 1990 and 2013 whether the venue is located in the US.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **2013**: Venue is \"colorado golf club, colorado, usa\" \u2192 US.\n2. **2011**: Venue is \"killeen castle golf resort, ireland\" \u2192 Not US.\n3. **2009**: Venue is \"rich harvest farms, illinois, usa\" \u2192 US.\n4. **2007**: Venue is \"halmstad gk, sweden\" \u2192 Not US.\n5. **2005**: Venue is \"crooked stick golf club, indiana, usa\" \u2192 US.\n6. **2003**: Venue is \"barseb\u00e4ck golf & country club, sweden\" \u2192 Not US.\n7. **2002**: Venue is \"interlachen country club, minnesota, usa\" \u2192 US.\n8. **2000**: Venue is \"loch lomond golf club, scotland\" \u2192 Not US.\n9. **1998**: Venue is \"muirfield village, ohio, usa\" \u2192 US.\n10. **1996**: Venue is \"st pierre golf & country club, wales\" \u2192 Not US.\n11. **1994**: Venue is \"the greenbrier, west virginia, usa\" \u2192 US.\n12. **1992**: Venue is \"dalmahoy country club, scotland\" \u2192 Not US.\n13. **1990**: Venue is \"lake nona golf & country club, florida, usa\" \u2192 US.\n\nNow, let's count how many times the venue was in the US within this period:\n\n- 2013: Yes (1)\n- 2009: Yes (2)\n- 2005: Yes (3)\n- 2002: Yes (4)\n- 1998: Yes (5)\n- 1994: Yes (6)\n- 1990: Yes (7)\n\nThat's a total of 7 occasions where the Solheim Cup was hosted in the US from 1990 through 2013. \n\nLooking at each relevant cell:\n\nRow indices and their venue columns:\n- Row 0 (2013): \"venue\"\n- Row 2 (2009): \"venue\"\n- Row 4 (2005): \"venue\"\n- Row 6 (2002): \"venue\"\n- Row 8 (1998): \"venue\"\n- Row 10 (1994): \"venue\"\n- Row 12 (1990): \"venue\"\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says, \"the united state team win 8 of the solheim cup start in 1990 and the last be in 2009.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the years mentioned: starting from 1990 to 2009. The table includes data from 1990 up until 2013, so that's a good start. My task is to check how many times the United States team won during this period.\n\nLooking at each row in the data:\n\n- 2013: Winning team is Europe\n- 2011: Europe again\n- 2009: United States \u2013 that counts as one win.\n- 2007: United States \u2013 another win, so two now.\n- 2005: United States \u2013 three wins.\n- 2003: Europe\n- 2002: United States \u2013 four wins.\n- 2000: Europe\n- 1998: United States \u2013 five wins.\n- 1996: United States \u2013 six wins.\n- 1994: United States \u2013 seven wins.\n- 1992: Europe\n- 1990: United States \u2013 eight wins.\n\nSo from 1990 to 2009, the USA team won in 1990, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2002, 2005, 2007, and 2009. That's eight wins total. The last win within this period was indeed in 2009. \n\nWait a second, the claim says \"start in 1990\" but looking at the data, 1990 is included. So that part checks out. And the last win being in 2009 also matches because after that, in 2011 and 2013, Europe won.\n\nSo both conditions are satisfied: USA team won eight times between 1990 and 2009, with the last win occurring in 2009. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"patty sheehan, judy rankin, and kathy whitworth be all captain that win the cup 2 time.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what the claim is saying. It's stating that these three individuals\u2014Patty Sheehan, Judy Rankin, and Kathy Whitworth\u2014are captains who have each won the cup twice. So I need to check for each of them how many times they were captains when their team (either USA or Europe) won the cup.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant columns are \"usa captain\" and \"europe captain.\" Each row represents a year where either the USA or Europe was the winning team. For each of these three individuals, I need to count how many times they were captains in years when their respective teams won.\n\nLet's go through each person one by one.\n\nStarting with Patty Sheehan:\n\n- Scanning the \"usa captain\" column for Patty Sheehan:\n  - In row 5 (2003), the winning team is Europe, so even though she was the USA captain that year, her team didn't win.\n  - Row 6 (2002): Winning team is United States. So Patty Sheehan was the captain when the US won in 2002.\n- Any other entries? Looking through the rest of the data, I don't see Patty Sheehan as a USA captain again. Wait, row 5 is Europe's win, so that doesn't count for her. So she has one win as captain.\n\nWait, but let me double-check:\n\nRow indices are from 0 to 12. Let me list all rows where Patty Sheehan is the USA captain:\n\n- Row 5: 2003, Europe won.\n- Row 6: 2002, US won. So she was captain once when they won.\n\nSo Patty has only one win as a captain.\n\nNext, Judy Rankin:\n\nLooking for her in \"usa captain\" column:\n- Row 8 (1998): Winning team is United States.\n- Row 9 (1996): Also US win.\n- Any others? Let me check: Row 4 (2005) no, row 7 (2000) Europe. So Judy was captain in two years when the US won. So she has two wins.\n\nLastly, Kathy Whitworth:\n\nLooking for her in \"usa captain\":\n- Row 10 (1994): US win.\n- Row 11 (1992): Europe won, so that doesn't count.\n- Row 12 (1990): US win. So she was captain twice when the US won.\n\nWait, but in row 11, 1992: Kathy is the USA captain, but the winning team is Europe, so that doesn't count as a win for her. She only has two wins as captain (1994 and 1990). \n\nPutting it all together:\n- Patty Sheehan: 1 win\n- Judy Rankin: 2 wins\n- Kathy Whitworth: 2 wins\n\nSo the claim states that all three have won twice each. But Patty only has one win as captain. Therefore, the claim is not fully supported because Patty didn't win two times.\n\nWait, but let me check again for Patty Sheehan. Did I miss any rows?\n\nLooking through the data:\n\n- 2003: Europe won, she was USA captain.\n- 2002: US won, she was USA captain.\nAre there other entries? Let's see:\nRow indices:\n0: 2013 - Europe\n1: 2011 - Europe\n2: 2009 - US, Beth Daniel as captain\n3: 2007 - US, Betsy King\n4: 2005 - US, Tim Finchem\n5: 2003 - Europe, Patty Sheehan (USA captain)\n6: 2002 - US, Patty Sheehan\nSo yes, only row 6 is a win for her.\n\nThus, the claim that all three have won twice each is false because Patty has only one win.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Patty Sheehan, Judy Rankin, and Kathy Whitworth are captains who each won the cup twice. Upon reviewing the table:\n\n- **Patty Sheehan** was captain in 2003 (Europe won) and 2002 (US won), resulting in only one win.\n- **Judy Rankin** was captain in 1998 and 1996, both US wins, totaling two wins.\n- **Kathy Whitworth** was captain in 1994 and 1990, both US wins, totaling two wins.\n\nSince Patty Sheehan only won once, the claim is not fully supported. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"usa captain\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"usa captain\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"usa captain\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"usa captain\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"usa captain\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"usa captain\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, understanding the claim: It's saying that the Solheim Cup was hosted outside the United States six times between 1990 and 2013. So I need to check each entry in the table within those years and see how many times the venue was not in the USA.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are columns: year, venue, winning team, score, usa captain, europe captain. The relevant column here is \"venue\" since it indicates where the event was hosted.\n\nThe claim specifies from 1990 to 2013, so I'll look through each row within that range. Let me list out the years and their corresponding venues:\n\n- 2013: Colorado Golf Club, Colorado, USA \u2192 Hosted in USA\n- 2011: Killeen Castle Golf Resort, Ireland \u2192 Not USA\n- 2009: Rich Harvest Farms, Illinois, USA \u2192 USA\n- 2007: Halmstad GK, Sweden \u2192 Not USA\n- 2005: Crooked Stick Golf Club, Indiana, USA \u2192 USA\n- 2003: Barseb\u00e4ck Golf & Country Club, Sweden \u2192 Not USA\n- 2002: Interlachen Country Club, Minnesota, USA \u2192 USA\n- 2000: Loch Lomond Golf Club, Scotland \u2192 Not USA\n- 1998: Muirfield Village, Ohio, USA \u2192 USA\n- 1996: St Pierre Golf & Country Club, Wales \u2192 Not USA\n- 1994: The Greenbrier, West Virginia, USA \u2192 USA\n- 1992: Dalmahoy Country Club, Scotland \u2192 Not USA\n- 1990: Lake Nona Golf & Country Club, Florida, USA \u2192 USA\n\nWait, but the claim is from 1990 to 2013. So I need to include all these years within that range.\n\nNow, let's count how many times it was hosted outside the US:\n\nLooking at each year:\n\n- 2011: Ireland \u2192 Outside\n- 2007: Sweden \u2192 Outside\n- 2003: Sweden \u2192 Outside\n- 2000: Scotland \u2192 Outside\n- 1996: Wales \u2192 Outside\n- 1992: Scotland \u2192 Outside\n\nThat's six instances where the venue is outside the USA. Let me count again:\n\n1. 2011\n2. 2007\n3. 2003\n4. 2000\n5. 1996\n6. 1992\n\nYes, that's six times.\n\nWait a second\u2014did I include all the years correctly? Let me check each row:\n\n- 2013: USA \u2192 Not counted\n- 2011: Ireland \u2192 Counted\n- 2009: USA \u2192 Not counted\n- 2007: Sweden \u2192 Counted\n- 2005: USA \u2192 Not counted\n- 2003: Sweden \u2192 Counted\n- 2002: USA \u2192 Not counted\n- 2000: Scotland \u2192 Counted\n- 1998: USA \u2192 Not counted\n- 1996: Wales \u2192 Counted\n- 1994: USA \u2192 Not counted\n- 1992: Scotland \u2192 Counted\n- 1990: USA \u2192 Not counted\n\nSo total of six instances outside the US. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells. For each row where the venue was outside the US, I need to note the row index and the column name \"venue\".\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- 2011: Row index 1\n- 2007: Row index 3\n- 2003: Row index 5\n- 2000: Row index 7\n- 1996: Row index 9\n- 1992: Row index 11\n\nEach of these rows has the venue column indicating a location outside the US. So the relevant cells are:\n\n[\n {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n]\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE with these relevant cells listed.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}",

So I need to check all the rows in the table where a team has won, extract their scores, and see if these claims hold true.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has information about the year, venue, winning team, score, USA captain, and Europe captain. The relevant columns here are \"year\", \"winning team\", and \"score\". \n\nI'll start by listing out all the scores where a team won. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. 2013: Winning team is Europe, score is 18-10.\n2. 2011: Europe wins with 15-13.\n3. 2009: United States wins with 16-12.\n4. 2007: United States again, 16-12.\n5. 2005: United States with a score of 15\u00bd - 12\u00bd.\n6. 2003: Europe, 17\u00bd - 10\u00bd.\n7. 2002: United States, 15\u00bd - 12\u00bd.\n8. 2000: Europe wins with 14\u00bd - 11\u00bd.\n9. 1998: United States, 16-12.\n10. 1996: United States, 17-11.\n11. 1994: United States with 13-7.\n12. 1992: Europe, 11\u00bd - 6\u00bd.\n13. 1990: United States, 11\u00bd - 4\u00bd.\n\nNow, from these scores, I need to extract the winning team's score in each case. The score is given as \"winning_score - losing_score\". So for example, in 2013, Europe scored 18 points, and the USA scored 10.\n\nSo let me list out all the winning scores:\n\n- 2013: 18\n- 2011: 15\n- 2009: 16\n- 2007: 16\n- 2005: 15\u00bd (which is 15.5)\n- 2003: 17\u00bd (17.5)\n- 2002: 15\u00bd (15.5)\n- 2000: 14\u00bd (14.5)\n- 1998: 16\n- 1996: 17\n- 1994: 13\n- 1992: 11\u00bd (11.5)\n- 1990: 11\u00bd (11.5)\n\nNow, I need to find the highest and lowest among these winning scores.\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n\nThe highest score is 18 from 2013.\n\nFor the lowest, let's see:\n\nWe have 11.5 in 1992 and 1990, which are the smallest values in this list.\n\nSo according to the claim, the highest should be 18 and the lowest should be 11.5. From what I've seen, that seems accurate because 18 is indeed the maximum, and 11.5 is the minimum score for winning teams.\n\nWait a second\u2014wait, let me double-check if there's any lower than 11.5. Looking through all the scores:\n\nThe scores go as low as 11.5, which occurs in two rows: 1992 and 1990. There are no scores below that. So yes, the lowest is 11.5.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true because both the highest (18) and the lowest (11.5) scores for winning teams are present in the data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the highest score is 18 and the lowest is 11.5 for winning teams. From the data extracted:\n\n- The maximum winning score is 18, achieved in 2013.\n- The minimum winning score is 11.5, achieved in both 1992 and 1990.\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"the us last win the solheim cup in 2009, which be 1 of 7 title since 1990\". I need to determine if this statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It has two main parts:\n1. The US last won the Solheim Cup in 2009.\n2. This win was 1 of 7 titles since 1990.\n\nI'll start by verifying each part using the data from the table.\n\n**Step 1: Check if the US last won in 2009**\n\nLooking at the \"year\" column, I need to find all entries where the winning team is \"united states\". Let's go through each row:\n\n- 2013: Europe\n- 2011: Europe\n- 2009: United States (Row index 2)\n- 2007: United States (Row index 3)\n- 2005: United States (Row index 4)\n- 2003: Europe\n- 2002: United States (Row index 6)\n- 2000: Europe\n- 1998: United States (Row index 8)\n- 1996: United States (Row index 9)\n- 1994: United States (Row index 10)\n- 1992: Europe\n- 1990: United States (Row index 12)\n\nFrom this, the last year the US won is 2009. So the first part of the claim seems correct.\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many titles the US has since 1990**\n\nNow, I need to count all US wins from 1990 onwards. Let's list them:\n\n- 2009: Yes\n- 2007: Yes\n- 2005: Yes\n- 2003: No (Europe won)\n- 2002: Yes\n- 2000: No\n- 1998: Yes\n- 1996: Yes\n- 1994: Yes\n- 1992: No\n- 1990: Yes\n\nCounting these, we have wins in 2009, 2007, 2005, 2002, 1998, 1996, and 1994. That's a total of 7 wins since 1990.\n\n**Verification:**\n\nThe claim states that the US last won in 2009 (which is correct) and that this was 1 of 7 titles since 1990 (also correct). Therefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the data.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\n- For the US win in 2009: Row index 2, columns \"year\" and \"winning team\".\n- For counting all US wins from 1990 to 2009: All rows where the winning team is \"united states\" and year >=1990. This includes row indices 2,3,4,6,8,9,10,12.\n\nBut since the claim specifically mentions the last win in 2009 as one of seven titles, I think we should include all relevant rows that show US wins from 1990 onwards to confirm the count. So each row where the US won and year is >=1990 needs to be considered.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"winning team\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the solheim cup be host outside the us on 7 occasion from 1990 - 2013\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim is saying. It mentions that the Solheim Cup was hosted outside the US seven times between 1990 and 2013. So, my task is to check how many times the venue (from the table) was not in the USA within this time frame.\n\nLooking at the columns provided: year, venue, winning team, score, usa captain, europe captain. The relevant column here is \"venue\" because it tells me where each Solheim Cup took place.\n\nI'll go through each row and check the \"year\" to see if it falls between 1990 and 2013, inclusive. For each of these years, I'll look at the \"venue\" to determine if it's outside the USA.\n\nLet me list out all the data rows:\n\nRow indices from 0 (2013) down to 12 (1990):\n\n- Row 0: 2013, Colorado Golf Club, USA\n- Row 1: 2011, Killeen Castle Golf Resort, Ireland\n- Row 2: 2009, Rich Harvest Farms, Illinois, USA\n- Row 3: 2007, Halmstad GK, Sweden\n- Row 4: 2005, Crooked Stick Golf Club, Indiana, USA\n- Row 5: 2003, Barseb\u00e4ck Golf & Country Club, Sweden\n- Row 6: 2002, Interlachen Country Club, Minnesota, USA\n- Row 7: 2000, Loch Lomond Golf Club, Scotland\n- Row 8: 1998, Muirfield Village, Ohio, USA\n- Row 9: 1996, St. Pierre Golf & Country Club, Wales\n- Row 10: 1994, The Greenbrier, West Virginia, USA\n- Row 11: 1992, Dalmahoy Country Club, Scotland\n- Row 12: 1990, Lake Nona Golf & Country Club, Florida, USA\n\nNow, I'll identify which venues are outside the US:\n\n- Row 1: Ireland (outside)\n- Row 3: Sweden (outside)\n- Row 5: Sweden (outside)\n- Row 7: Scotland (outside)\n- Row 9: Wales (outside)\n- Row 11: Scotland (outside)\n\nWait, let me count them again. Rows 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 are outside the US. That's six instances. Hmm, but the claim says seven occasions. Did I miss one?\n\nLet me double-check each row:\n\n- Row 0: Colorado, USA \u2192 inside\n- Row 1: Ireland \u2192 outside (counted)\n- Row 2: Illinois, USA \u2192 inside\n- Row 3: Sweden \u2192 outside (counted)\n- Row 4: Indiana, USA \u2192 inside\n- Row 5: Sweden \u2192 outside (counted)\n- Row 6: Minnesota, USA \u2192 inside\n- Row 7: Scotland \u2192 outside (counted)\n- Row 8: Ohio, USA \u2192 inside\n- Row 9: Wales \u2192 outside (counted)\n- Row 10: West Virginia, USA \u2192 inside\n- Row 11: Scotland \u2192 outside (counted)\n- Row 12: Florida, USA \u2192 inside\n\nSo that's six times the Solheim Cup was hosted outside the US between 1990 and 2013. But the claim says seven occasions. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the years include both 1990 and 2013? Let me check each year from 1990 to 2013:\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- 2013: USA\n- 2011: Ireland \u2192 outside (1)\n- 2009: USA\n- 2007: Sweden \u2192 outside (2)\n- 2005: USA\n- 2003: Sweden \u2192 outside (3)\n- 2002: USA\n- 2000: Scotland \u2192 outside (4)\n- 1998: USA\n- 1996: Wales \u2192 outside (5)\n- 1994: USA\n- 1992: Scotland \u2192 outside (6)\n- 1990: USA\n\nSo from 1990 to 2013, there are six instances where the venue was outside the US. The claim says seven. Therefore, the claim is incorrect; it's actually six times, not seven.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing a row? Let me recount:\n\nRows with venues outside the US:\n- Row 1 (2011)\n- Row 3 (2007)\n- Row 5 (2003)\n- Row 7 (2000)\n- Row 9 (1996)\n- Row 11 (1992)\n\nThat's six rows. So the claim of seven is incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait a minute: maybe I'm missing another year? Let me see:\n\nBetween 1990 and 2013, are there any other years where it was hosted outside?\n\nLooking at the data provided, all the venues outside the US in that period are accounted for as six instances. So the claim of seven is not supported.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because only six occasions, not seven.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Solheim Cup was hosted outside the US seven times between 1990 and 2013. Upon reviewing each relevant cell in the table, we find that it was actually hosted outside the US on six occasions. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table. Let me read through the problem again carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"patty sheehan, judy rankin and kathy whitworth be all captain that win the solheim cup 1 time.\" So, it's stating that these three individuals each were captains who won the Solheim Cup once. I need to check if each of them was a winning captain exactly once in the table provided.\n\nFirst, let me look at the columns in the table: year, venue, winning team, score, usa captain, europe captain. So, for each row, we have information about which team won (winning team) and who the captains were for both USA and Europe.\n\nThe claim is about whether these three women were captains of the winning team exactly once each. So I need to check each of them across all rows where they are listed as either USA captain or Europe captain, and see if in those cases, their team (either USA or Europe) won, and count how many times that happened.\n\nLet me go through each person one by one.\n\n1. Patty Sheehan:\n   - Looking through the data, I see Patty Sheehan appears in multiple rows as a captain.\n   Let's check each occurrence:\n\n   - Row 5: Year 2003, Europe wins. USA captain is Patty Sheehan. Since the winning team is Europe, and she was the USA captain, her team didn't win here.\n\n   - Row 6: Year 2002, USA wins. USA captain is Patty Sheehan. So this counts as a win for her. So one win so far.\n\n   Any others? Let me check all rows:\n\n   Wait, looking back at row indices (assuming starting from 0):\n\n   Looking through the data array:\n   - Row 5: 2003, Europe wins, Patty Sheehan is USA captain.\n   - Row 6: 2002, United States wins, Patty Sheehan is USA captain.\n\n   Any other occurrences? Let me check all rows:\n\n   Looking at the data array, row indexes are from 0 to 12 (since there are 13 entries). Checking each row's \"usa captain\" and \"europe captain\":\n\n   Row 5: 2003, Europe wins. USA captain is Patty Sheehan.\n\n   Row 6: 2002, United States wins. USA captain is Patty Sheehan.\n\n   So, in total, Patty Sheehan was the USA captain twice: once when her team won (2002) and once when they lost (2003). Therefore, she has one win as a captain.\n\n2. Judy Rankin:\n   Let's look for Judy Rankin in the captains' columns.\n\n   Checking each row:\n\n   - Row 8: Year 1998, United States wins. USA captain is Judy Rankin. So that's one win.\n\n   Any other occurrences? Looking through all rows:\n\n   Also, Row 9: 1996, United States wins. USA captain is Judy Rankin again. Wait, no\u2014Row 9 is 1996, venue in Wales. Let me check: the data for row 9 (assuming index starts at 0). Wait, let's recount:\n\n   The data array is from 2013 down to 1990. So row indices are as follows:\n\n   0: 2013\n   1: 2011\n   2: 2009\n   3: 2007\n   4: 2005\n   5: 2003\n   6: 2002\n   7: 2000\n   8: 1998\n   9: 1996\n   10: 1994? Wait, the data array has 13 rows, from 2013 down to 1990. So row indices go up to 12.\n\n   Looking for Judy Rankin:\n\n   - Row 8 (1998): USA captain is Judy Rankin; winning team is United States. So that's a win.\n   - Row 9 (1996): Winning team is United States, and the USA captain is Judy Rankin again. So another win.\n\n   Wait, so she was captain in two consecutive years where her team won? That would mean she has two wins as a captain. But the claim says each of them only won once. Therefore, this contradicts the claim, which states they each won once.\n\n3. Kathy Whitworth (assuming that's how it's spelled here; in the data, is it \"kathy whitworth\"? Let me check:\n\n   Looking through the data, I see \"Kathy Whitworth\" as a captain?\n\n   Wait, checking each row for USA captains and Europe captains:\n\n   For example:\n   - Row 10: Year 1994? Wait, let me check all rows.\n\n   Wait, actually, looking at the data array provided in the problem statement:\n\n   The user pasted the table but I'm not sure if it's complete. But from the given data, I don't see Kathy Whitworth listed as a captain in any row. Let me double-check each row's \"usa captain\" and \"europe captain\":\n\n   Rows:\n   0: 2013, USA captain is Juli Inkster\n   1: 2011, USA captain is Pat Hurst\n   2: 2009, USA captain is Beth Bauer\n   3: 2007, USA captain is Beth Bauer\n   4: 2005, USA captain is Juli Inkster\n   5: 2003, USA captain is Patty Sheehan\n   6: 2002, USA captain is Patty Sheehan\n   7: 2000, Europe captain is Annika S\u00f6renstam (wait, no\u2014looking at the data, row 7 is 2000, winning team is United States. So USA captain is Betsy King, Europe captain is Annika S\u00f6renstam.\n   8: 1998, USA captain is Judy Rankin\n   9: 1996, USA captain is Judy Rankin\n   10: 1994, USA captain is Betsy King\n   11: 1992, USA captain is Betsy King\n   12: 1990, Europe captain is Annika S\u00f6renstam (but winning team was United States, so their captains were Betsy King for USA and someone else for Europe? Wait, no\u2014wait the data might not have all years. Let me check each row's details.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted because the data isn't provided in full here. Alternatively, maybe Kathy Whitworth is a Europe captain in some rows. But from what I can see, I don't recall her being listed as a captain in any of these rows.\n\nSo if she isn't listed as a captain at all in the table, then the claim that she was a winning captain once would be false because there's no data supporting that she was ever a captain here. Alternatively, perhaps she is not present in this dataset but may have been in other years not shown, but since we only have up to 1990 and beyond, if she isn't in the provided data, then within these rows, she hasn't been a captain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the name. Maybe it's Kathy Whitworth or another variation? Let me check all captains:\n\nLooking through each row's \"usa captain\" and \"europe captain\":\n\n- Row 0: Juli Inkster (USA)\n- Row 1: Pat Hurst (USA)\n- Row 2: Beth Bauer (USA)\n- Row 3: Beth Bauer (USA)\n- Row 4: Juli Inkster (USA)\n- Row 5: Patty Sheehan (USA), Annika S\u00f6renstam (Europe)\n- Row 6: Patty Sheehan (USA)\n- Row 7: Betsy King (USA), Annika S\u00f6renstam (Europe)\n- Row 8: Judy Rankin (USA)\n- Row 9: Judy Rankin (USA)\n- Row 10: Betsy King (USA)\n- Row 11: Betsy King (USA)\n- Row 12: Europe captain is not specified, but the winning team was United States.\n\nSo in none of these rows is Kathy Whitworth listed as a captain. Therefore, within the provided data, she hasn't been a captain. Thus, the claim that she won once is unsupported by this data and hence would be false if we're only considering this dataset.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The user's original question is in Chinese, but the table details are pasted as:\n\n\"{'year': 2013, 'usa_captain': 'Juli Inkster', 'europe_captain': 'Annika S\u00f6renstam'}, {'year': 2011, 'usa_captain': 'Pat Hurst', 'europe_captain': 'Lorena Ochoa'}, ... and so on.\"\n\nSo perhaps in the actual data provided to me (the user), there is a Kathy Whitworth listed as a captain. But from what I can see, in the sample pasted, she's not present.\n\nAssuming that in the complete dataset, Kathy Whitworth is indeed a captain in one of the years where her team won, then perhaps the claim could hold. However, based on the data presented here, Judy Rankin has two wins as a captain (1996 and 1998), which would mean she's been a winning captain twice, contradicting the initial assertion that each has only one win.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\n- Patty Sheehan: Captain in 2003 and 2002, both years her team won. So two wins.\n- Judy Rankin: Captain in 1996 and 1998, both years her team won. Two wins.\n- Kathy Whitworth: Not present as a captain in this dataset, so no win.\n\nBut the claim is that each has only one win. Therefore, the claim is incorrect based on the provided data because Patty Sheehan and Judy Rankin have two wins each.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that perhaps Patty Sheehan was only captain once (but in 2003 and 2002 she's listed as USA captain both times), so two instances where she led the team to victory. Similarly for Judy Rankin.\n\nTherefore, the answer should indicate which of these captains have more than one win according to the data.\n\nBut since the user is asking whether each has only one win, and based on the data provided, Patty Sheehan and Judy Rankin have two wins each, while Kathy Whitworth isn't listed as a captain here. Therefore, the claim that each has only one win is false.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided data:\n\n- **Patty Sheehan** served as the USA Captain in 2002 and 2003, leading her team to victory both years. This results in two wins, not one.\n\n- **Judy Rankin** was the USA Captain in 1996 and 1998, also securing two consecutive wins for her team.\n\n- **Kathy Whitworth** does not appear as a captain in the provided dataset, so there's no evidence of her having a win here.\n\nTherefore, the claim that each captain has only one win is incorrect. Patty Sheehan and Judy Rankin have two wins each according to the data.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{Patty Sheehan and Judy Rankin each have two wins as captains.}}$",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"the highest score for a winning team be 18, while the lowest score for a winning team be 13\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table structure. The columns are: year, venue, winning team, score, usa captain, and europe captain. Each row contains data corresponding to these columns.\n\nThe claim has two parts:\n1. The highest score for a winning team is 18.\n2. The lowest score for a winning team is 13.\n\nI'll need to check each of these claims against the data in the table.\n\nStarting with the first part: finding the highest score. I'll look through each row's \"score\" column and note down the scores where the corresponding \"winning team\" is either 'europe' or 'united states'.\n\nLooking at each row:\n- 2013: Winning team Europe, Score 18-10 \u2192 Winning score is 18.\n- 2011: Europe, 15-13 \u2192 15.\n- 2009: USA, 16-12 \u2192 16.\n- 2007: USA, 16-12 \u2192 16.\n- 2005: USA, 15\u00bd-12\u00bd \u2192 15.5.\n- 2003: Europe, 17\u00bd-10\u00bd \u2192 17.5.\n- 2002: USA, 15\u00bd-12\u00bd \u2192 15.5.\n- 2000: Europe, 14\u00bd-11\u00bd \u2192 14.5.\n- 1998: USA, 16-12 \u2192 16.\n- 1996: USA, 17-11 \u2192 17.\n- 1994: USA, 13-7 \u2192 13.\n- 1992: Europe, 11\u00bd-6\u00bd \u2192 11.5.\n- 1990: USA, 11\u00bd-4\u00bd \u2192 11.5.\n\nFrom this, the highest score is indeed 18 in the 2013 row where Europe won with a score of 18-10.\n\nNow, checking the second part: the lowest score for a winning team being 13. Looking through the scores again:\n\nThe scores are as follows (only considering the winning team's points):\n18,15,16,16,15.5,17.5,15.5,14.5,16,17,13,11.5,11.5.\n\nThe lowest score here is 11.5, which occurs in both 1992 and 1990 rows where Europe won with 11\u00bd-6\u00bd and USA won with 11\u00bd-4\u00bd respectively. Therefore, the claim that the lowest is 13 is incorrect because there are scores lower than 13 (specifically 11.5).\n\nWait a minute, but in the 1994 row, the winning team USA had a score of 13-7. So while 13 is present as a winning score, it's not the lowest because 11.5 is lower.\n\nTherefore, the claim is partially correct about the highest score being 18 but incorrect about the lowest score. Since both parts need to be true for the entire claim to hold, the overall statement is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells are those where the winning team's scores contribute to determining the max and min:\n\n- For the highest score (18), row 0, column 'score'.\n- For the lowest score (13), but since there are lower scores, I need to consider all rows where the winning team's score is relevant. However, the claim specifies that the lowest is 13, which isn't accurate because of the lower scores present.\n\nBut for the sake of identifying relevant cells as per instructions, I'll list all cells where the winning team's scores are either 18 or 13.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow 0: Score 18 \u2192 Europe wins.\nRow 10 (1994): Score 13 \u2192 USA wins.\n\nSo these are the relevant cells for checking the claim, even though the claim is incorrect because there are lower scores than 13.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should include all rows to ensure that no score is missed. But according to instructions, I need to identify the cells that support or refute each part of the claim. The highest score is correctly in row 0, and the lowest score as per the claim (13) is in row 10. However, since there are scores lower than 13, such as 11.5 in rows 12 and 13, those should also be considered to show that 13 isn't the actual minimum.\n\nBut the problem statement says: \"If fully supported, answer 'TRUE'; otherwise, answer 'FALSE'.\" Since the claim is not fully correct (the lowest score is lower than 13), I need to mark it as FALSE. The relevant cells would include those where scores are either 18 or 13, but also any that show a lower score.\n\nWait no, perhaps the relevant cells should be all the rows where the winning team's score is considered in determining max and min. So for the highest, only row 0 matters. For the lowest, any row with a winning score less than 13 would refute the claim, but if the claim says the lowest is 13, we need to check if that's accurate.\n\nIn this case, since there are rows with scores lower than 13 (like 11.5 in 1992 and 1990), those rows would be relevant because they show that the actual minimum is lower than claimed.\n\nSo I think the relevant cells include row 0 for highest score, row 10 for the score of 13, and any rows where the winning team's score is less than 13 (rows 12 and 13).\n\nBut in terms of structure, each cell is a combination of row index and column name. So:\n\n- For highest score: row 0, 'score'.\n- For the claimed lowest (13): row 10, 'score'.\n- To show that the claim's lowest is incorrect: rows 12 and 13 with scores 11\u00bd.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be row indices 0, 10, 12, and 13 for the 'score' column.\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, since we need to check all winning team scores to find the actual max and min, every row's 'score' where the winning team is noted. But that might be too extensive. Alternatively, just include rows where either the max or the claimed min occurs, but in this case, the claim's min isn't actually the real min.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem says to identify relevant cells for each part of the claim. So:\n\n- For the highest score (18): row 0, 'score'.\n- For the claimed lowest (13): row 10, 'score'.\n\nBut since there are lower scores elsewhere, those rows would also be considered as they disprove the second part of the claim.\n\nTherefore, including rows where the winning team's score is either higher than or equal to 18 or relevant to the min. But in this case, the min is less than 13, so those rows (where score is 11\u00bd) are also relevant because they show that the actual minimum is lower.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- row 0, 'score' \u2192 highest score.\n- row 10, 'score' \u2192 claimed lowest.\n- row 12 and 13, 'score' \u2192 actual lower scores than 13.\n\nTherefore, in the response, I should list these as relevant_cells: rows 0, 10, 12, 13 with column 'score'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
