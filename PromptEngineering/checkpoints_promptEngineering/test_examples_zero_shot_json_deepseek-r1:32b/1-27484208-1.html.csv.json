    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"it may come as a surprise, but dartmouth college rank higher than the university of t\u00fcbingen\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns in the table to find where the ranks are listed. The relevant columns for ranking seem to be:\n- world rank by the - wur 2013\n- world rank by arwu 2013\n- world rank by qs 2013\n\nNext, I'll identify the rows for Dartmouth College and University of T\u00fcbingen.\n\nDartmouth College is in row 0. Let's check its ranks:\n- wur: 126th\n- arwu: 151 - 200th\n- qs: 113th\n\nUniversity of T\u00fcbingen is in row 4. Their ranks are:\n- wur: 201 - 225th\n- arwu: 151 - 200th\n- qs: 144th\n\nNow, I need to compare the ranks of Dartmouth and T\u00fcbingen across all ranking sources.\n\nFor wur (world university rankings), Dartmouth is 126th and T\u00fcbingen is 201-225th. So, Dartmouth has a higher rank here since 126 is better than 201-225.\n\nLooking at arwu (academic ranking of world universities), both are in the same range: 151 - 200th. So, their ranks are equal in this source.\n\nFor qs (QS World University Rankings), Dartmouth is 113th and T\u00fcbingen is 144th. Again, Dartmouth has a higher rank here.\n\nSince at least one ranking source shows Dartmouth higher than T\u00fcbingen (specifically wur and qs), the claim could be TRUE if considering any of these sources. However, I need to check all applicable rankings because the claim doesn't specify which ranking it refers to. \n\nBut the claim states that Dartmouth ranks higher overall, so if in at least one major ranking they are higher, it can be considered a valid claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE. The relevant cells include the wur and qs ranks for both universities.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs  , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs  , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "university of western australia do better , overall than durham university despite it 's late date of establishment",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"university of western australia do better, overall than durham university despite it's late date of establishment.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. So, the main points are:\n\n1. University of Western Australia (UWA) does better overall compared to Durham University.\n2. This is despite UWA being established later than Durham.\n\nI should check both these aspects using the data provided in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: members, country, year established, world rank by WUR 2013, ARWU 2013, and QS 2013. So, each row represents a university with its details.\n\nI'll start by identifying the rows for UWA and Durham University. \n\n- Durham University is in row 1.\n- University of Western Australia (UWA) is in row 5.\n\nNext, I need to compare their ranks from all three ranking systems: WUR, ARWU, and QS.\n\nFor Durham:\n- WUR rank: 80th\n- ARWU rank: 201 - 300th\n- QS rank: 90th\n\nFor UWA:\n- WUR rank: 168th\n- ARWU rank: 91st\n- QS rank: 134th\n\nNow, let's analyze each ranking:\n\n1. WUR Rank:\n   - Durham is ranked 80th, which is better than UWA's 168th. So, in this category, Durham does better.\n\n2. ARWU Rank:\n   - Durham falls into the 201-300th range.\n   - UWA is ranked 91st. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 91st is much higher (better) than 201-300th. So, here UWA does better.\n\nWait a minute, that seems contradictory. Let me check the data again to make sure I didn't mix up the rows.\n\nLooking back: \n\nDurham's ARWU rank is \"201 - 300th\", and UWA's ARWU rank is \"91st\". Yes, so UWA is better in ARWU.\n\n3. QS Rank:\n   - Durham is 90th.\n   - UWA is 134th. So here, Durham does better.\n\nSo now, comparing all three:\n\n- WUR: Durham (80) > UWA (168)\n- ARWU: UWA (91) > Durham (201-300)\n- QS: Durham (90) > UWA (134)\n\nIt's a mixed result. In two rankings, Durham is better, and in one, UWA is better.\n\nBut the claim says \"overall\" better. So, does overall mean considering all three? Or maybe it depends on how we weigh each ranking.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user considers only certain rankings as more important, but without that context, I have to assume equal importance.\n\nIn two out of three categories, Durham is better than UWA, while in one category, UWA is better. So, overall, it's not clear that UWA does better than Durham across all metrics. \n\nAdditionally, looking at the \"year established\" column:\n\n- Durham was established in 1832.\n- UWA in 1911.\n\nSo UWA is indeed younger (established later) than Durham.\n\nBut the claim states that despite being established later, UWA does better overall. However, based on the ranks provided, UWA doesn't perform better across all metrics; they are mixed.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the data because in two rankings, UWA is worse than Durham, and only better in one. So the overall performance doesn't favor UWA enough to say they do better overall.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu  , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs  , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year established\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu  , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs  , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I have a table in JSON format and a claim about it. My job is to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the table structure. The columns are \"members\", \"country\", \"year established\", \"world rank by the - wur 2013\", \"world rank by arwu 2013\", and \"world rank by qs 2013\". There are six rows of data for different universities.\n\nThe claim states: \"overall, durham university have the best rank, i.e., 80th, in the world rank by - wur 2013 category.\" So, I need to check two things here. First, is Durham University's rank in the wur 2013 category indeed 80th? Second, is this the best (lowest numerical value) among all universities listed?\n\nLooking at the data, let me find the row for Durham University. Scanning through the \"members\" column, I see that Durham University is listed as the second entry in the data array (index 1). \n\nIn that row, under the \"world rank by the - wur, 2013\" column, it says \"80th\". So that part checks out. Now, I need to compare this rank with all other universities' ranks in the same category to see if it's the best (lowest) among them.\n\nLet me go through each university:\n\n1. Dartmouth College: 126th\n2. Durham University: 80th\n3. Queens University: 226-250th\n4. University of Otago: 226-250th\n5. University of Tuebingen: 201-225th\n6. University of Western Australia: 168th\n\nLooking at these, the ranks are as follows in numbers:\n\n- Dartmouth: 126\n- Durham: 80\n- Queens: 226-250 (let's consider the lower bound for comparison)\n- Otago: same as Queens\n- Tuebingen: 201-225 (again, take the lower bound of 201)\n- Western Australia: 168\n\nSo comparing all these numerical values:\n\nThe lowest is Durham at 80, followed by Western Australia at 168, then Dartmouth at 126? Wait, no. Wait, 126 is higher than 80 but lower than 168? No, wait: numerically, a lower rank number means a better position. So the order from best (lowest) to worst would be:\n\n- Durham: 80\n- Dartmouth: 126 (is 126 worse than 80)\nWait no, 80 is better than 126 because it's lower. Then Western Australia at 168 is even higher than 126, so worse.\n\nSo the ranks in wur 2013 are:\n\nDurham: 80\n\nDartmouth: 126\n\nWestern Australia: 168\n\nQueens and Otago: around 226-250\n\nTuebingen: 201-225.\n\nSo, in this case, Durham's 80th is indeed the best (lowest) rank among all listed universities in the wur 2013 category. \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Durham has the lowest (best) rank of 80th in that specific category.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"queen university of canada have not do as well as dartmouth college in all 3 category.\" \n\nSo, Queen University (Canada) and Dartmouth College (USA) are being compared across three categories. I assume these categories refer to the three world rankings provided: WUR 2013, ARWU 2013, and QS 2013.\n\nLooking at the table, I should find the rows for Queen University and Dartmouth College. \n\nFrom the data:\n- Dartmouth College is in row 0.\n- Queen's University (note the apostrophe S) is in row 2.\n\nNow, let's look at their rankings:\n\nFor Dartmouth College:\n- WUR: 126th\n- ARWU: 151 - 200th\n- QS: 113th\n\nFor Queen University (Canada):\n- WUR: 226 - 250th\n- ARWU: 201 - 300th\n- QS: 189th\n\nThe claim says that Queen's hasn't done as well as Dartmouth in all three categories. So, I need to check each category:\n\n1. WUR (World University Rankings):\n   Dartmouth is 126th, while Queen's is 226-250th. Clearly, Dartmouth ranks higher here.\n\n2. ARWU:\n   Dartmouth is in the 151-200th range, whereas Queen's is in 201-300th. Again, Dartmouth is better.\n\n3. QS:\n   Dartmouth is at 113th, and Queen's is 189th. Dartmouth is higher again.\n\nIn all three categories, Dartmouth College ranks higher than Queen University of Canada. Therefore, the claim that Queen's hasn't done as well as Dartmouth in all three categories is TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells:\n\n- For Dartmouth College: row 0\n   - WUR: column \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"\n   - ARWU: \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"\n   - QS: \"world rank by qs , 2013\"\n\n- For Queen's University: row 2\n   - Same three columns as above.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are all these six entries.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided.\n\nThe claim says: \"give how it have have a great headstart , university of t\u00fcbingen , germany have not do as well as the other university , overall\"\n\nHmm, okay, so breaking this down. The claim is about the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany. It mentions that despite having a great headstart, which I assume refers to being established earlier, the university hasn't performed as well as others overall.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a different university with various ranks from different ranking systems (WUR, ARWU, QS) all in 2013. The \"year established\" column might indicate how long the universities have been around, which could relate to the headstart mentioned.\n\nFirst, let's find the University of T\u00fcbingen in the table. Scanning through the data rows:\n\n- Dartmouth College (USA, 1769)\n- Durham University (UK, 1832)\n- Queens University (Canada, 1841)\n- University of Otago (New Zealand, 1869)\n- University of T\u00fcbingen (Germany, 1477)\n- University of Western Australia (Australia, 1911)\n\nSo, the University of T\u00fcbingen was established in 1477, which is earlier than all the others except Dartmouth College (1769). So T\u00fcbingen does have a longer history, which could be considered a headstart.\n\nNow, looking at their ranks:\n\n- WUR: 201 - 225th\n- ARWU: 151 - 200th\n- QS: 144th\n\nComparing this to other universities:\n\nDartmouth College:\n- WUR: 126th\n- ARWU: 151-200th\n- QS: 113th\n\nDurham University:\n- WUR: 80th\n- ARWU: 201-300th\n- QS: 90th\n\nQueens University:\n- WUR: 226-250th\n- ARWU: 201-300th\n- QS: 189th\n\nUniversity of Otago:\n- WUR: 226-250th\n- ARWU: 201-300th\n- QS: 155th\n\nUniversity of Western Australia:\n- WUR: 168th\n- ARWU: 91st\n- QS: 134th\n\nSo, T\u00fcbingen's ranks across all three systems are worse or equal compared to others. For example:\n\n- In WUR, it's 201-225th, while Dartmouth is 126th and Durham is 80th.\n- ARWU: T\u00fcbingen is 151-200th, same as Dartmouth and better than Queens, Otago, but worse than UWA (91st).\n- QS: T\u00fcbingen is 144th, which is better than Queens (189th) and Otago (155th), but worse than Dartmouth (113th), Durham (90th), and UWA (134th).\n\nOverall, considering all three rankings, T\u00fcbingen doesn't perform as well as the others. For example, compared to UWA, which is younger (established in 1911) but has better ranks across all systems except ARWU.\n\nTherefore, the claim that despite having a headstart, T\u00fcbingen hasn't done as well as other universities overall seems correct.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year established\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"dartmouth college have never rank higher than the university of t\u00fcbingen\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: members, country, year established, world rank by the - wur 2013, world rank by arwu 2013, and world rank by qs 2013. So each row represents a university with their respective rankings from three different sources in 2013.\n\nThe claim is comparing Dartmouth College and University of T\u00fcbingen regarding their ranks. I need to check if Dartmouth has ever ranked higher than T\u00fcbingen across any of these ranking systems for the year 2013.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Dartmouth College (row index 0) has the following rankings:\n  - WUR: 126th\n  - ARWU: 151-200th\n  - QS: 113th\n\n- University of T\u00fcbingen (row index 4) has these rankings:\n  - WUR: 201-225th\n  - ARWU: 151-200th\n  - QS: 144th\n\nNow, I'll compare each ranking:\n\n1. **WUR Ranking (world rank by the - wur , 2013):**\n   - Dartmouth is at 126th.\n   - T\u00fcbingen is in 201-225th.\n   Here, Dartmouth is higher because 126 is better than 201. So in WUR, Dartmouth ranks higher.\n\n2. **ARWU Ranking (world rank by arwu , 2013):**\n   - Both are listed as 151-200th. So they are tied here; neither is higher than the other.\n\n3. **QS Ranking (world rank by qs , 2013):**\n   - Dartmouth is at 113th.\n   - T\u00fcbingen is at 144th.\n   Here, Dartmouth is again higher because 113 is better than 144.\n\nSo in two out of three rankings, Dartmouth has a higher rank (which means it's actually ranked lower numerically) than T\u00fcbingen. The claim states that Dartmouth has \"never\" ranked higher, but we've found instances where they did. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there are cases where Dartmouth was ranked higher.\n\nThe relevant cells for this analysis would be the rankings from both universities across all three ranking sources.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim about the University of Western Australia (UWA) is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"University of Western Australia does better in all rankings than Durham University despite its later date of establishment.\"\n\nSo, there are two main points here:\n1. UWA has a higher rank (i.e., lower numerical value) in all three ranking systems compared to Durham.\n2. UWA was established after Durham.\n\nLet's start by looking at the data for both universities.\n\nDurham University is listed in row index 1:\n- Established: 1832\n- WUR Rank: 80th\n- ARWU Rank: 201 - 300th\n- QS Rank: 90th\n\nUniversity of Western Australia (UWA) is in row index 5:\n- Established: 1911\n- WUR Rank: 168th\n- ARWU Rank: 91st\n- QS Rank: 134th\n\nNow, comparing the establishment years: Durham was established in 1832, UWA in 1911. So, UWA is indeed younger (later date).\n\nNext, let's check each ranking:\n\n1. WUR Rank:\n   - Durham: 80th\n   - UWA: 168th\n   Lower rank means better, so Durham is better here.\n\n2. ARWU Rank:\n   - Durham: 201-300th\n   - UWA: 91st\n   Again, lower rank (better) for UWA? Wait, no\u2014lower numbers are better. So UWA's 91st is better than Durham's 201-300th.\n\nWait a second, that would mean in ARWU, UWA is better. Hmm, but the claim says \"do better in all rankings.\" Let me recheck.\n\nLooking back:\nDurham's ARWU rank is \"201 - 300th,\" while UWA's is \"91st.\" So yes, UWA is higher (better) here.\n\nQS Rank:\n- Durham: 90th\n- UWA: 134th\nSo, lower rank for Durham again. Thus, in QS ranking, Durham is better.\n\nWait, so in WUR and QS, Durham has a better rank than UWA, but in ARWU, UWA is better. Therefore, the claim that UWA does better in \"all rankings\" isn't true because in two of the three rankings (WUR and QS), Durham is higher-ranked than UWA.\n\nWait no, let me double-check:\n- WUR: 80th vs. 168th \u2192 Durham better\n- ARWU: 201-300 vs. 91st \u2192 UWA better\n- QS: 90th vs. 134th \u2192 Durham better\n\nSo, in two out of three rankings (WUR and QS), Durham is higher-ranked than UWA. Therefore, the claim that UWA does better in all rankings is false.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at ARWU for Durham: \"201  - 300th\" as per the table. So it's within that range. For UWA, it's \"91st.\" So yes, UWA is better in ARWU.\n\nBut in WUR and QS, UWA has higher numerical ranks than Durham, meaning worse rankings. Therefore, UWA doesn't do better in all three; they are only better in one ranking.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE because UWA does not have a better rank in all three systems compared to Durham.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because while the University of Western Australia (UWA) was established later than Durham University, it does not perform better across all rankings. In two out of three rankings (WUR and QS), Durham ranks higher.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year established\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year established\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about Durham University's rank is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"Durham University have the second-best rank, i.e., 80th, in the world rank by - wur 2013 category.\" So the key points here are Durham University's position as second best and their specific rank of 80th according to the WUR 2013 ranking.\n\nI'll start by locating Durham University in the table. Scanning through the \"members\" column, I see that Durham University is listed in row index 1 (since indexing starts at 0). \n\nNext, I need to check their rank under the \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\" category. Looking at row 1, the relevant cell is indeed \"80th\". So according to the table, Durham University has an 80th rank in this category.\n\nNow, the claim mentions that this rank makes them second-best. To verify this, I should check if there's a university ranked higher than 80th. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Dartmouth College: \"126th\" (row 0)\n- Durham University: \"80th\" (row 1)\n- Queens University: \"226 - 250th\" (row 2)\n- University of Otago: \"226 - 250th\" (row 3)\n- University of T\u00fcbingen: \"201 - 225th\" (row 4)\n- University of Western Australia: \"168th\" (row 5)\n\nComparing all the ranks, Durham's 80th is better than Dartmouth's 126th and all others. So, is there any university with a higher rank? Let me make sure I'm interpreting the ranges correctly.\n\nLooking at other rows:\n- University of T\u00fcbingen has \"201 - 225th\", which is worse than Durham's 80th.\n- University of Western Australia is at \"168th\", still worse than 80th.\n\nWait a minute, I notice that the claim states it's the second-best. But in this table, Durham is ranked higher (better) than all others except perhaps none? Let me check again.\n\nActually, the ranks go from lower numbers to higher, meaning lower number is better. So the best rank would be the smallest number. Looking through:\n\n- Dartmouth: 126\n- Durham: 80\n- Queens: 226-250\n- Otago: same as Queens\n- T\u00fcbingen: 201-225\n- Western Australia: 168\n\nSo, the best rank is Durham's 80th. There's no university in this table with a better (lower) rank than 80. Therefore, Durham would be first, not second.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"second-best\". Perhaps the claim is referring to within some context beyond just these universities? But according to the data provided, Durham has the highest position (lowest number) in this category.\n\nSo the claim says it's second best, but based on the table, Durham is actually first. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states a second-best ranking when in reality, they are top as per the given data.\n\nWait no, let me double-check. The table only includes six universities, so within these, Durham has the best rank at 80th. If we consider all universities globally, perhaps there are others not listed here that have better ranks. But according to the claim and the provided data, it's referring to this specific table.\n\nHence, the claim is FALSE because within the given data, Durham University holds the highest (best) rank in the WUR 2013 category, not second.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Durham University has the second-best rank of 80th in the WUR 2013 category. However, according to the table, Durham University's rank is indeed 80th, which is better than all other universities listed. Therefore, it should be considered first, not second.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says, \"queen university of canada have do better than dartmouth college in all 3 category.\" I need to check each relevant category for both universities and see if Queen University has a better rank than Dartmouth College in all three categories.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It lists six universities with their respective ranks from different organizations: WUR (world rank by the - wur, 2013), ARWU (world rank by arwu, 2013), and QS (world rank by qs, 2013).\n\nI need to find the rows for Queen University of Canada and Dartmouth College. From the data:\n\n- Dartmouth College is in row 0.\n- Queens University is in row 2.\n\nNow, let's check each category.\n\n1. **World Rank by WUR (2013):**\n   - Dartmouth: \"126th\"\n   - Queen: \"226  - 250th\"\n\n   So, Dartmouth is ranked 126th, which is better than Queen's 226-250th. Therefore, in this category, Dartmouth is better.\n\n2. **World Rank by ARWU (2013):**\n   - Dartmouth: \"151  - 200th\"\n   - Queen: \"201  - 300th\"\n\n   Again, Dartmouth's rank is higher (better) than Queen's here as well.\n\n3. **World Rank by QS (2013):**\n   - Dartmouth: \"113th\"\n   - Queen: \"189th\"\n\n   Here, Dartmouth still has a better rank than Queen University.\n\nSince in all three categories, Dartmouth College is ranked higher (better) than Queen University of Canada, the claim that Queen University did better in all three categories is FALSE. \n\nNow, to compile the relevant cells:\n\n- For Dartmouth's WUR: row 0, column \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"\n- Queen's WUR: row 2, same column\n- Dartmouth's ARWU: row 0, column \"world rank by arwu  , 2013\"\n- Queen's ARWU: row 2, same column\n- Dartmouth's QS: row 0, column \"world rank by qs  , 2013\"\n- Queen's QS: row 2, same column\n\nSo all these cells are relevant because they directly compare the ranks in each category between the two universities.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu  , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu  , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs  , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs  , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the University of T\u00fcbingen is true or false based on the given table. Let me read through everything carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"University of t\u00fcbingen, germany have rank the worst in every single ranking.\" Hmm, so they're saying that in all three rankings (WUR 2013, ARWU 2013, QS 2013), T\u00fcbingen has the worst rank among the universities listed.\n\nFirst, I should check what data is available for each university. Let's look at the table structure. The columns are \"members\", \"country\", \"year established\", \"world rank by the - wur, 2013\", \"world rank by arwu, 2013\", and \"world rank by qs, 2013\".\n\nLooking for University of T\u00fcbingen in the data. I see it's row index 4. Let me list their ranks:\n\n- WUR: 201-225th\n- ARWU: 151-200th\n- QS: 144th\n\nNow, let's check each ranking to see if T\u00fcbingen is the lowest in all of them.\n\nStarting with WUR. Looking at all universities:\n\nDartmouth: 126th (which is better than 201-225)\nDurham: 80th (better)\nQueens: 226-250th (worse than T\u00fcbingen)\nOtago: 226-250th (same as Queens, worse than T\u00fcbingen's upper bound of 225)\nT\u00fcbingen: 201-225th\nWestern Australia: 168th\n\nSo in WUR, Queens and Otago are ranked worse than T\u00fcbingen. So T\u00fcbingen isn't the worst here.\n\nNext, ARWU:\n\nDartmouth: 151-200th\nDurham: 201-300th (worse)\nQueens: 201-300th\nOtago: 201-300th\nT\u00fcbingen: 151-200th\nWestern Australia: 91st\n\nSo in ARWU, T\u00fcbingen is better than Durham, Queens, and Otago. So again, not the worst.\n\nQS:\n\nDartmouth: 113th\nDurham: 90th (better)\nQueens: 189th (worse)\nOtago: 155th\nT\u00fcbingen: 144th\nWestern Australia: 134th\n\nIn QS, Queens is worse than T\u00fcbingen. So T\u00fcbingen isn't the worst in that either.\n\nSo for each ranking, there's at least one university ranked worse than T\u00fcbingen. Therefore, the claim that they are the worst in every single ranking is false.\n\nI'll mark the answer as FALSE and list the relevant cells from the table that show their ranks compared to others.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
