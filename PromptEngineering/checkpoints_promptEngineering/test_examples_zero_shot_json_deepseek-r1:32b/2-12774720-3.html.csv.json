    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the highest win - loss score for michael kohlmann be 5 - 4\".\n\nFirst, I should understand what the table represents. Looking at the columns, they are years from 1999 to 2012, and the rows seem to list different tournaments and some statistics.\n\nThe first row under \"tournament\" is \"grand slam tournaments\", which probably serves as a header for the following rows: Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open. Then there's a row labeled \"win - loss\".\n\nSo, each of these grand slam tournaments has entries for each year, showing either their performance (like 2r for second round) or win-loss records.\n\nThe claim is about Michael Kohlmann's highest win-loss score being 5-4. I'm assuming that the \"win - loss\" row refers to his performance across these years.\n\nLooking at the \"win - loss\" row, the data is as follows:\n\n1999: 1 - 4  \n2002: 1 - 4  \n2004: 4 - 4  \n2006: 3 - 4  \n2007: 5 - 4  \n2010: 5 - 4  \n2011: 5 - 4  \n2012: 2 - 4  \n\nFrom these, the highest win-loss score is indeed 5-4 in 2007, 2010, and 2011. So the claim that his highest score was 5-4 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the entries under \"win - loss\" for the years where it's 5-4.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the win-loss records in the table. The highest score of 5-4 appears multiple times, confirming the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2007\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2010\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2011\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So, it's saying that in those two years, Michael Kohlmann had a specific win-loss record. \n\nLooking at the table structure, I see columns for each year: \"1999\", \"2002\", etc., and rows for different tournaments. The last row is labeled \"win - loss\". So I think this row represents the overall performance across all tournaments for each year.\n\nThe claim mentions two years: 1999 and 2002. I need to check the win-loss scores for these years in the relevant cells.\n\nStarting with 1999, looking at the \"win - loss\" row under the column \"1999\", the value is \"1  - 4\". So that's a 1-4 record.\n\nNext, checking 2002: the same row under the \"2002\" column shows \"1  - 4\". That matches as well.\n\nSo both years have the win-loss score of 1-4. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are the ones under the 'win - loss' row for the columns '1999' and '2002'.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"there be only 1 sf in 2010 for michael kohlmann\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the table represents. The columns are years: 1999, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2011, and 2012. The rows seem to represent different tournaments or categories related to Michael Kohlmann's performance in these years.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- The first row after \"tournament\" is labeled as \"grand slam tournaments\", which repeats for each year. That might be a header for subsequent rows.\n- Then we have specific tournaments: Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open, each with their respective results per year.\n- The last row is \"win - loss\" statistics for each year.\n\nThe claim mentions \"1 sf in 2010\". I think \"sf\" stands for semifinals. So, the claim is stating that in 2010, Michael Kohlmann reached the semifinals only once across all tournaments he played.\n\nLooking at the data for 2010:\n\n- Australian Open: The entry is \"sf\", which likely means he reached the semifinals.\n- French Open: It's \"1r\", meaning first round.\n- Wimbledon: Also \"1r\".\n- US Open: \"2r\" (second round).\n- The win-loss record for 2010 is \"5 - 4\".\n\nSo, in 2010, the only time he reached the semifinals was at the Australian Open. There's no other \"sf\" in that year across other tournaments. Therefore, there's exactly one sf in 2010.\n\nHence, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2010\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2010\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Michael Kohlmann is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"Michael Kohlmann have 2r in 2004 Australian Open while 3r in French Open.\" \n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the table. The columns are the years and tournaments, but looking at the data, it seems that each row represents a tournament or a statistic. The first row under \"columns\" is labeled as \"tournament\", followed by years from 1999 to 2012. Then, there are rows for each major Grand Slam tournament: Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open, and finally a row for win-loss records.\n\nWait, the data structure might be a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. The \"data\" array has multiple arrays, each representing a row. The first element in \"data\" is [\"grand slam tournaments\", ...], which seems to be headers or categories. Then each subsequent row starts with the tournament name followed by entries for each year.\n\nSo, looking at the data:\n\nRow 0: [\"grand slam tournaments\", repeated for all columns] - probably a header indicating that these are Grand Slam tournaments.\nRow 1: Australian Open with entries from 1999 to 2012. The entry in 2004 (third column) is \"2r\".\nRow 2: French Open, and the 2004 entry is \"3r\" as well.\n\nWait, no. Let me check the structure correctly. Each row starts with the tournament name followed by data for each year from 1999 to 2012 in order. So:\n\n- Row index 1: Australian Open\n- Column indices correspond to years: columns[1] is 1999, columns[2] is 2002, etc.\n\nWait no, the \"columns\" array starts with \"tournament\", then 1999, 2002, 2004, etc. So for each row, the first element is the tournament name, followed by entries for each year in order of columns[1] to columns[8], which are years from 1999, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012.\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Let me list the columns:\n\ncolumns = [\"tournament\", \"1999\", \"2002\", \"2004\", \"2006\", \"2007\", \"2010\", \"2011\", \"2012\"]\n\nSo for each row in data, the first element is the tournament, then 8 elements corresponding to these years.\n\nNow, looking at Row 1 (index 1): Australian Open. The entries are:\n\n[\"australian open\", \"2r\", \"1r\", \"2r\", \"1r\", \"1r\", \"sf\", \"3r\", \"2r\"]\n\nWait, let me map the columns correctly.\n\nRow 1: [Australian Open, 1999: 2r, 2002:1r, 2004:2r, 2006:1r, 2007:1r, 2010:sf, 2011:3r, 2012:2r]\n\nSimilarly, Row 2 (French Open) has:\n\n[\"french open\", \"1r\", \"1r\", \"3r\", \"1r\", \"qf\", \"1r\", \"3r\", \"1r\"]\n\nSo in 2004 (third column after tournament), French Open is \"3r\".\n\nThe claim says that Michael Kohlmann had 2r in 2004 Australian Open and 3r in French Open.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For Australian Open in 2004: It's \"2r\" as per Row1, column 2004 (third element after tournament name). So that's correct.\n- For French Open in 2004: It's \"3r\" in Row2, same year.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by the table. Therefore, the answer is TRUE. The relevant cells are:\n\nFor Australian Open 2004: row_index 1 (since rows start at 0?), wait no. Let me check the indices again.\n\nWait, the data array starts with Row 0 being [\"grand slam tournaments\", ...], then Row1 is Australian Open, Row2 French Open, etc.\n\nSo for the claim:\n\n- Australian Open in 2004: row_index 1, column_name \"2004\"\n- French Open in 2004: row_index 2, column_name \"2004\"\n\nWait no. Wait, each row starts with the tournament name followed by years from 1999 to 2012. So for Row1 (Australian Open), the columns are:\n\ncolumns[0] is \"tournament\" which is \"australian open\", then columns[1]=1999: value \"2r\", column[2]=2002:\"1r\", column3=2004:\"2r\".\n\nWait, but in the data array, each row's elements correspond to the columns as per their order. So for Row1:\n\ncolumns[0] = tournament: \"australian open\"\n\ncolumns[1] (1999): \"2r\"\n\ncolumns[2] (2002): \"1r\"\n\ncolumns[3] (2004): \"2r\"\n\nSo in 2004, Australian Open is at row_index=1, column_name=\"2004\".\n\nSimilarly, French Open's 2004 entry is row_index=2, column_name=\"2004\": value \"3r\".\n\nYes, so the relevant cells are:\n\n- [row_index=1, column=\"2004\"] for Australian Open: \"2r\"\n\n- [row_index=2, column=\"2004\"] for French Open: \"3r\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data. \n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify relevant rows and columns:**\n   - The claim pertains to Australian Open in 2004 and French Open in 2004.\n   - In the table, each row corresponds to a tournament, with the first element being the name followed by years from 1999 onwards.\n\n2. **Locate Australian Open's 2004 result:**\n   - Row index 1 (Australian Open) has entries for each year starting from 1999.\n   - For 2004 (third column after 'tournament'), the value is \"2r\".\n\n3. **Locate French Open's 2004 result:**\n   - Row index 2 (French Open) similarly lists results, with 2004 also at the third position.\n   - The value here is \"3r\".\n\n**Answer:** The claim is correct; Michael Kohlmann achieved a second-round finish in the 2004 Australian Open and a third-round finish in the same year's French Open.\n\n\\boxed{True}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"michael kohlman play for total of 8 time in both wimbledon and us open\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. The columns are \"tournament\", \"1999\", \"2002\", \"2004\", \"2006\", \"2007\", \"2010\", \"2011\", and \"2012\". Each row under these columns seems to represent different tournaments, with the first data row being \"grand slam tournaments\" repeated. Then we have specific tournaments like \"australian open\", \"french open\", \"wimbledon\", and \"us open\". The last row is \"win - loss\".\n\nWait, looking at the rows:\n\n- Row 0: All entries are \"grand slam tournaments\".\n- Row 1: Australian Open with various results.\n- Row 2: French Open with results.\n- Row 3: Wimbledon with results.\n- Row 4: US Open with results.\n- Row 5: Win-Loss records for each year.\n\nThe claim is about Michael Kohlman's participation in Wimbledon and US Open. So, I need to look at rows 3 (Wimbledon) and 4 (US Open).\n\nLooking at the \"wimbledon\" row (row index 3), the data from columns 1999 to 2012 are: \"1r\", \"2r\", \"1r\", \"2r\", \"2r\", \"1r\", \"1r\", \"2r\". Similarly, for US Open (row index 4): \"1r\", \"1r\", \"2r\", \"3r\", \"2r\", \"2r\", \"2r\", \"1r\".\n\nEach entry in these columns represents the round reached each year. For example, \"1r\" is first round, \"2r\" second round, etc.\n\nThe claim says he played a total of 8 times in both tournaments combined. Let's count how many years he participated in each tournament.\n\nFor Wimbledon (row 3): Each column from 1999 to 2012 has an entry except for the first cell which is \"wimbledon\". So that's 8 entries, meaning he played 8 times at Wimbledon.\n\nFor US Open (row 4): Similarly, columns from 1999 to 2012 have data, so 8 appearances there as well.\n\nAdding both tournaments together: 8 (Wimbledon) + 8 (US Open) = 16 total participations. But the claim says he played a total of 8 times in both combined. That's not matching because it should be 16 if each tournament has 8 entries.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It could mean that he participated 8 times across both tournaments, but looking at the data, each tournament shows participation every year from 1999 to 2012, which is 8 years per tournament. So combined, it's 16 participations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"play for total of 8 time\" refers to appearances in matches, not participations. For example, each appearance could count as one match. But the data shows results like \"1r\", which usually means he lost in the first round. Each participation would result in at least one match (the first round). So if he participated in both tournaments 8 times each, that's 8 + 8 = 16 matches.\n\nHowever, the claim says a total of 8 times across both. This suggests that the number is much lower than what the table shows. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because according to the table, he played in both Wimbledon and US Open 8 times each, totaling 16 participations, not 8.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states Michael Kohlman played a total of 8 times in both Wimbledon and US Open combined. However, the table shows he participated in each tournament every year from 1999 to 2012, which is 8 years per tournament. Therefore, the total participations would be 16, not 8.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wimbledon\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"us open\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine whether the claim \"the highest win - loss score for michael kohlmann be 4 - 4\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are \"tournament\", followed by years from 1999 to 2012. Each row under these columns contains data about different tournaments and a final row for \"win - loss\".\n\nThe claim mentions Michael Kohlmann's highest win-loss score being 4-4. I need to check if this is accurate based on the table.\n\nLooking at the \"win - loss\" row, which is the last row in the data array (index 5), each cell corresponds to a year and shows the win-loss record for that year. The entries are as follows:\n\n- 1999: 1 - 4\n- 2002: 1 - 4\n- 2004: 4 - 4\n- 2006: 3 - 4\n- 2007: 5 - 4\n- 2010: 5 - 4\n- 2011: 5 - 4\n- 2012: 2 - 4\n\nNow, I need to determine the highest win-loss score. The \"win\" part is before the hyphen, so higher numbers indicate better performance.\n\nLooking at each year's wins:\n- 1999: 1 win\n- 2002: 1 win\n- 2004: 4 wins (highest so far)\n- 2006: 3 wins\n- 2007: 5 wins (higher than 4, new highest)\n- 2010: 5 wins\n- 2011: 5 wins\n- 2012: 2 wins\n\nThe highest number of wins is 5, achieved in 2007, 2010, and 2011. Therefore, the highest win-loss score isn't 4-4 but rather 5-4.\n\nSince the claim states that the highest is 4-4, which is incorrect based on the table data, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are all the entries under \"win - loss\" because each one provides a win-loss record for a specific year, and we need to compare them to find the highest score.

There are five rows of data: the first row lists \"grand slam tournaments\" for each year, which I assume is a header or category. The next four rows detail specific tournaments: Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open. Each of these has entries under each year, such as \"2r\", \"1r\", etc., which likely stand for the round reached in that tournament.\n\nThe claim states: \"Michael Kohlmann's score for both the australian open and the french open be both 2r.\" So I'm looking to see if both tournaments have entries of \"2r\" for Michael Kohlmann.\n\nLooking at the data, each tournament row has entries from 1999 to 2012. For example, under Australian Open (row index 1), in 1999 it's \"2r\", but in other years like 2002 it's \"1r\". Similarly, for French Open (row index 2), in some years it's \"3r\" and others \"1r\".\n\nHowever, the claim doesn't specify a particular year. It says both tournaments should have \"2r\" scores. Let me check each tournament across all years:\n\n- Australian Open: The entries are \"2r\", \"1r\", \"2r\", etc.\n- French Open: The entries are mostly \"1r\" and some \"3r\".\n\nWait, looking at the data rows:\nRow 1 (Australian Open): [\"australian open\", \"2r\", \"1r\", \"2r\", \"1r\", \"1r\", \"sf\", \"3r\", \"2r\"]\nSo in 1999: 2r, 2002:1r, 2004:2r, etc.\n\nRow 2 (French Open): [\"french open\", \"1r\", \"1r\", \"3r\", \"1r\", \"qf\", \"1r\", \"3r\", \"1r\"]\nSo in all years listed, the French Open entries are either 1r or 3r, no 2r.\n\nTherefore, for each year, I need to check if both tournaments have \"2r\". Let's go through each year:\n\n- 1999: Australian Open is 2r, French Open is 1r \u2192 Not both 2r.\n- 2002: AO is 1r, FO is 1r \u2192 No.\n- 2004: AO is 2r, FO is 3r \u2192 No.\n- 2006: AO is 1r, FO is 1r \u2192 No.\n- 2007: AO is 1r, FO is qf (which is quarters, not relevant here) \u2192 No.\n- 2010: AO is sf, FO is 1r \u2192 No.\n- 2011: AO is 3r, FO is 3r \u2192 Both are not 2r.\n- 2012: AO is 2r, FO is 1r \u2192 Only AO is 2r.\n\nSo in no year do both tournaments have \"2r\" for the same player. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells would be all the entries under Australian Open and French Open across each year to verify there's no instance where both are \"2r\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"1999\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2002\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2004\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2006\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2007\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2010\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2011\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2012\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1999\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2002\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2004\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2006\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2007\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2010\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2011\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2012\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"there be several sf 's in 2010 for michael kohlman\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's start by understanding what the table contains.\n\nLooking at the JSON structure, it has columns representing years from 1999 to 2012 and rows that include tournament names like \"australian open,\" \"french open,\" etc., along with a row for win-loss records. Each cell under these tournaments likely represents Michael Kohlman's performance in that year.\n\nThe claim mentions \"several sf 's in 2010.\" I believe \"sf\" stands for semi-finals, which is a stage in the tournament. So, the claim is stating that Michael Kohlman reached the semi-finals multiple times in the year 2010 across different tournaments.\n\nFirst, I should check which rows correspond to each tournament and look at the data for the year 2010. The columns are [\"tournament\", \"1999\", \"2002\", ..., \"2010\", ...]. So, the relevant column is \"2010\".\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\nRow indices start from 0. The first row (index 0) seems to be a header for \"grand slam tournaments.\" Then, each subsequent row represents a specific tournament.\n\n- Row index 1: \"australian open\" with value \"sf\" in 2010.\n- Row index 2: \"french open\" with \"1r\" (first round) in 2010.\n- Row index 3: \"wimbledon\" with \"1r\" in 2010.\n- Row index 4: \"us open\" with \"2r\" (second round) in 2010.\n\nSo, only the Australian Open in 2010 shows an \"sf\". The other tournaments do not have \"sf\" in that year. Therefore, there's only one semi-final appearance in 2010 for Michael Kohlman, not several.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because he didn't reach the semi-finals multiple times in 2010; it happened once.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that in 2010, Michael Kohlman reached the semi-finals (sf) only in the Australian Open. There's no other \"sf\" for him that year across the listed tournaments.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:** The claim refers to the year 2010, so we look at the column named \"2010\".\n\n2. **Check Each Tournament in 2010:**\n   - Australian Open (Row 1): \"sf\" \u2192 Semi-finals.\n   - French Open (Row 2): \"1r\" \u2192 First round.\n   - Wimbledon (Row 3): \"1r\" \u2192 First round.\n   - US Open (Row 4): \"2r\" \u2192 Second round.\n\n3. **Count sf Appearances:** Only one instance of \"sf\" in 2010.\n\nSince there's only one semi-final appearance, not several, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2010\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2010\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2010\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2010\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"michael kohlman play wimbledon 4 time and the us open 6 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding the structure of the table.\n\nThe table has columns for various tournaments: \"tournament\", \"1999\", \"2002\", \"2004\", \"2006\", \"2007\", \"2010\", \"2012\". Then, there are rows that list different tournaments like \"australian open\", \"french open\", etc. Each of these has entries under each year, which I assume represent Michael Kohlman's performance in those tournaments for each respective year.\n\nLooking at the data, row 3 corresponds to Wimbledon. The entries are as follows: \"1r\" for 1999, \"2r\" for 2002, \"1r\" for 2004, \"2r\" for 2006, \"2r\" for 2007, \"1r\" for 2010, \"1r\" for 2011, and \"2r\" for 2012. So from 1999 to 2012, there are entries in the Wimbledon row for each year except maybe some missing years? Wait, the columns go up to 2012, so that's eight years: 1999, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012. That\u2019s eight entries for Wimbledon.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the US Open row (row 4), the entries are \"1r\" for 1999, \"1r\" for 2002, \"2r\" for 2004, \"3r\" for 2006, \"2r\" for 2007, \"2r\" for 2010, \"2r\" for 2011, and \"1r\" for 2012. Again, that's eight entries.\n\nSo the claim says Michael Kohlman played Wimbledon 4 times and US Open 6 times. Wait, but according to the table, he has 8 entries each? That seems contradictory. Let me double-check.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the rows. The first row is \"grand slam tournaments\" repeated multiple times. Then the next four rows are specific tournaments: Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open. Each of these has their own performance data across the years. So each year listed in the columns represents a tournament instance, and each entry under that year for a tournament indicates his participation.\n\nTherefore, if there's an entry (like \"1r\" or \"2r\") in a cell for Wimbledon, it means he played that year. So to find how many times he played Wimbledon, I need to count the number of years where there is a non-empty entry under Wimbledon. Similarly for US Open.\n\nLooking at Wimbledon row (row index 3), let's check each column:\n\n- 1999: \"1r\" \u2192 participated\n- 2002: \"2r\" \u2192 participated\n- 2004: \"1r\" \u2192 participated\n- 2006: \"2r\" \u2192 participated\n- 2007: \"2r\" \u2192 participated\n- 2010: \"1r\" \u2192 participated\n- 2011: \"1r\" \u2192 participated\n- 2012: \"2r\" \u2192 participated\n\nSo that's 8 times, not 4. Similarly for US Open (row index 4):\n\n- Each year from 1999 to 2012 has an entry except maybe some? Let me check:\n\nAll columns have entries. So 8 times as well.\n\nWait, the claim says he played Wimbledon 4 times and US Open 6 times. But according to the table, both are 8 times each. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because it states fewer participations than what's shown in the data.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be all the entries under Wimbledon and US Open across the years to count the number of participations.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Michael Kohlman played Wimbledon 4 times and the US Open 6 times. However, according to the table, he participated in both tournaments 8 times each. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"1999\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2002\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2004\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2006\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2007\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2010\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2011\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2012\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1999\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2002\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2004\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2006\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2007\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2010\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2011\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2012\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
