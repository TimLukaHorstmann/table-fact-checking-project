    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine whether the claim \"mark lillis have the most total goal of anyone in the season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table data.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the JSON table. The columns are: name, position, league apps, league goals, fa cup apps, fa cup goals, league cup apps, league cup goals, total apps, and total goals. Each row represents a player with their respective stats.\n\nThe claim is about Mark Lillis having the most total goals. So, I should focus on the \"total goals\" column to compare his goals against others.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\n- For each player, I'll check their \"total goals\" value.\n- Let's go through each row and note down the \"name\" and \"total goals\".\n\nStarting from the top:\n1. Terry Austin: 0 total goals\n2. Malcolm Brown: 11\n3. David Burke: 1\n4. David Cowling: 8\n5. Brian Cox: 0\n6. Maurice Cox: 1\n7. Steve Doyle: 2\n8. Roy Greenwood: 0\n9. Keith Hanvey: 4\n10. Timothy Hottes: 0\n11. Mick Laverick: 0\n12. Mark Lillis: 20\n13. Keith Mason: 0\n14. Daral Pugh: 2\n15. Colin Russell: 17\n16. Brian Stanton: 17\n17. Kevin Stonehouse: 0\n18. Dave Sutton: 2\n19. Peter Valentine: 0\n20. Phil Wilson: 6\n\nNow, comparing these numbers, the highest total goals are 20 from Mark Lillis. The next highest is 17 by both Colin Russell and Brian Stanton.\n\nSo, since no one else has more than 20 goals, Mark Lillis indeed has the most total goals. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nTo ensure I'm accurate, I'll double-check if any other players have higher or equal numbers. Looking again, no one surpasses 20, and only two others reach 17, which is less than 20. Thus, Mark Lillis does have the highest total goals in the season.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"total goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"4 people play the position of forward in the 1982 - 82 season\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, it has columns like \"name\", \"position\", and others that seem related to a sports team, probably football given terms like \"gk\" (goalkeeper) in the position column. The data includes rows for each player with their stats across different competitions.\n\nThe claim mentions forwards from the 1982-82 season, but I notice the table doesn't explicitly mention years or seasons. So, I'm assuming this table represents a specific season, maybe the 1982-83 or around that time, but it's not clear. However, since the claim specifies 1982-82, perhaps that's a typo and should be 1982-83? Or maybe the data is for that exact period.\n\nNext, I need to find all players whose position is \"fw\" because that stands for forward. Let's scan through each row:\n\nRow 0: terry austin - position fw\nRow 4: brian cox - gk (goalkeeper)\nRow 5: maurice cox - mf (midfielder)\nRow 6: steve doyle - mf\nRow 8: keith hanvey - df (defender)\nRow 9: timothy hotte - fw\nRow 10: mick laverick - mf\nRow 12: keith mason - gk\nRow 13: daral pugh - mf\nRow 14: colin russell - fw\nRow 15: brian stanton - mf\nRow 16: kevin stonehouse - fw\nRow 18: peter valentine - df\nRow 19: phil wilson - mf\n\nSo, the forwards are in rows 0 (terry austin), 9 (timothy hotte), 14 (colin russell), and 16 (kevin stonehouse). That's four players. \n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any or count incorrectly.\n\nRow 0: fw - yes\nRow 9: fw - yes\nRow 14: fw - yes\nRow 16: fw - yes\n\nTotal of four forwards. So the claim states there are 4 people playing as forward, which matches what's in the table. \n\nI also need to make sure that these players are indeed from the specified season. Since the table doesn't mention years, I have to assume it's for the 1982-83 season or perhaps another year, but since the claim is about 1982-82, maybe there's a discrepancy here. However, without explicit year information in the table, we can't verify the season part. But if we proceed under the assumption that this table represents that specific season, then the count of forwards is correct.\n\nTherefore, based on the data provided, the claim is true because there are four players listed as forwards.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim \"malcolm brown have 3 more total apps than david burke\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to locate the rows for Malcolm Brown and David Burke in the data array. Looking at the table:\n\n- The second row (index 1) has the name \"malcolm brown\".\n- The third row (index 2) has the name \"david burke\".\n\nNext, I'll check their \"total apps\" values because that's what the claim is about.\n\nFor Malcolm Brown:\n- The total apps are listed as \"56\". So, 56 apps in total.\n\nFor David Burke:\n- His total apps are \"53\". That means he has 53 apps in total.\n\nNow, I need to determine if 56 is indeed 3 more than 53. Subtracting 53 from 56 gives us 3. So yes, Malcolm Brown has exactly 3 more total appearances than David Burke.\n\nI should also make sure that there are no other factors or columns that might affect this calculation. Since the claim only mentions \"total apps\", I don't need to consider other columns like league goals or fa cup apps. \n\nDouble-checking the relevant cells:\n- Malcolm Brown's row (index 1) has \"56\" in the \"total apps\" column.\n- David Burke's row (index 2) has \"53\" in the same column.\n\nCalculating the difference: 56 - 53 = 3.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a given claim about a table (provided in JSON format) is TRUE or FALSE. The claim in question is: \"Brian Stanton be 1 of 2 people who have more than 0 FA Cup goal.\" \n\nFirst, I'll need to understand what exactly this claim is asserting. It seems that Brian Stanton is one person among two individuals who scored more than zero goals in the FA Cup. So, my goal is to verify if there are exactly two players with FA Cup goals greater than zero and whether Brian Stanton is one of them.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the relevant columns here are \"name\" and \"fa cup goals.\" Each row represents a player with their respective statistics. I'll need to scan through each row's \"fa cup goals\" value to find out who has more than zero goals.\n\nLet me start by going through each row:\n\n1. Terry Austin: FA Cup goals = 0\n2. Malcolm Brown: FA Cup goals = 1 \u2192 This is more than 0, so he's one candidate.\n3. David Burke: FA Cup goals = 0\n4. David Cowling: FA Cup goals = 0\n5. Brian Cox: FA Cup goals = 0\n6. Maurice Cox: FA Cup goals = 0\n7. Steve Doyle: FA Cup goals = 0\n8. Roy Greenwood: FA Cup goals = 0 (and note that his FA cup apps are \"0 (1)\", but the goal is zero)\n9. Keith Hanvey: FA Cup goals = 0\n10. Timothy Hotte: FA Cup goals = 0\n11. Mick Laverick: FA Cup goals = 0\n12. Mark Lillis: FA Cup goals = 0\n13. Keith Mason: FA Cup goals = 0\n14. Daral Pugh: FA Cup goals = 0 (apps are \"0 (1)\", but goals remain zero)\n15. Colin Russell: FA Cup goals = 0 (though he has a league cup goal of 1, that's not relevant here)\n16. Brian Stanton: Let's check his FA Cup goals. The value is 2 \u2192 This is more than 0, so he's another candidate.\n17. Kevin Stonehouse: FA Cup goals = 0\n18. Dave Sutton: FA Cup goals = 0\n19. Peter Valentine: FA Cup goals = 0\n20. Phil Wilson: FA Cup goals = 0\n\nFrom this scan, only Malcolm Brown and Brian Stanton have FA Cup goals greater than zero. That makes exactly two people as per the claim.\n\nNow, focusing on Brian Stanton's row index to confirm his position in the table. Looking back at the JSON structure, rows are indexed starting from 0. Brian Stanton is listed as the 16th entry (index 15, since indexing starts at 0). Wait, no\u2014let me recount:\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the data, row indices start from 0. Let's see:\n\nRow 0: Terry Austin\nRow 1: Malcolm Brown\n...\nRow 15: Brian Stanton\n\nYes, so Brian Stanton is at row index 15. \n\nNow, to compile the relevant cells for verification:\n- For Malcolm Brown (row index 1), check \"fa cup goals.\"\n- For Brian Stanton (row index 15), check \"fa cup goals.\"\n\nThis confirms that both have more than zero FA Cup goals, and they are indeed the only two with such a record. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI need to ensure I'm not missing anyone else who might have scored in the FA Cup. Double-checking all rows again quickly\u2014nope, it's just those two.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"mark lillis be tie for most total goal of the season\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the table. The columns are: name, position, league apps, league goals, fa cup apps, fa cup goals, league cup apps, league cup goals, total apps, and total goals. So each row represents a player with their stats across different competitions.\n\nThe claim is about Mark Lillis being tied for the most total goals in the season. I need to check two things: how many total goals Mark Lillis has, and then compare it with other players' total goals to see if he's either alone at the top or tied.\n\nLooking through the data, let me find Mark Lillis. Scanning the names... there he is on row 12 (since indexing starts at 0). Let me confirm: yes, row index 12 has \"mark lillis\" as the name.\n\nNow, looking at his total goals. The column for total goals is the last one in each data row. For Mark Lillis, it's listed as 20. So he has 20 total goals.\n\nNext step is to check if any other player(s) have 20 or more total goals. I'll go through each row:\n\n1. terry austin: 0 goals\n2. malcolm brown: 11\n3. david burke: 1\n4. david cowling: 8\n5. brian cox: 0\n6. maurice cox: 1\n7. steve doyle: 2\n8. roy greenwood: 0\n9. keith hanvey: 4\n10. timothy hotte: 0\n11. mick laverick: 0\n12. mark lillis: 20 (this is the row we're interested in)\n13. keith mason: 0\n14. daral pugh: 2\n15. colin russell: 17\n16. brian stanton: 17\n17. kevin stonehouse: 0\n18. dave sutton: 2\n19. peter valentine: 0\n20. phil wilson: 6\n\nLooking at these numbers, Mark Lillis is the only one with 20 goals. The next highest is colin russell and brian stanton with 17 each. So no one else has as many or more than Mark.\n\nTherefore, since he's the sole leader in total goals, there's no tie. The claim says he's tied for most, but according to the data, he's actually leading alone.\n\nWait a second, maybe I missed someone? Let me double-check. Scanning again through all rows:\n\n- Row 0: terry austin has 0.\n- Row 1: malcolm brown 11.\n- Row 2: david burke 1.\n- Row 3: david cowling 8.\n- Row 4: brian cox 0.\n- Row 5: maurice cox 1.\n- Row 6: steve doyle 2.\n- Row 7: roy greenwood 0.\n- Row 8: keith hanvey 4.\n- Row 9: timothy hotte 0.\n- Row 10: mick laverick 0.\n- Row 11: maurice cox again? Wait, no, row 12 is mark lillis with 20. Then rows after that have colin russell (row 14) at 17, brian stanton (row 15) at 17. Others are lower.\n\nSo yes, Mark Lillis is the only one with 20 goals. Therefore, he's not tied; he has the most alone.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if there's another player with 20? Let me check all rows again:\n\nRow indices 0 to 20 (since there are 21 players). Only row 12 (mark lillis) has 20. The others have lower numbers. So no one else is at 20.\n\nTherefore, the claim that he's tied for most total goals is false because he's the only one with the highest number.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Mark Lillis is tied for the most total goals, but the data shows he has 20 goals, which is higher than any other player. Therefore, he isn't tied; he leads alone.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"total goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So my task is to count how many players have 'fw' listed under the \"position\" column and see if that number is exactly five.\n\nLooking at the table structure provided in JSON format, I can see the columns are: name, position, league apps, etc. Each row represents a player's data for the season.

I don't see any others. Rows with 'fw' are only these four. So the count is four, not five.\n\nTherefore, the claim that five people played as forwards is incorrect; it's actually four.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount or skip a row.

So there are at least two players who scored in the FA Cup.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Brian Stanton is the only one who scored an FA Cup goal is FALSE because Malcolm Brown also scored.\n\nNow, I need to collect the relevant cells. Let's find where in the table these goals are recorded.\n\n- For Brian Stanton: row index 15 (since rows start at 0), column \"fa cup goals\".\n- For Malcolm Brown: row index 1, same column.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"}\n- {\"row__index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"}\n\nThis confirms that both have scored in the FA Cup, thus making the claim false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because both Brian Stanton and Malcolm Brown have scored in the FA Cup.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"},\n     {\"row__index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"dave sutton and phil wilson both have 44 league apps\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, let's parse the table. The columns are: name, position, league apps, league goals, fa cup apps, fa cup goals, league cup apps, league cup goals, total apps, total goals.\n\nI need to find the rows corresponding to \"dave sutton\" and \"phil wilson\".\n\nLooking through the data array:\n\n- For dave sutton: I search for his name. Found at row index 17 (assuming indexing starts at 0). His league apps are listed as \"41\". Wait, let me double-check that.\n\nWait, looking back: The rows go from 0 to 19? Let's count:\n\nRow 0: terry austin\nRow 1: malcolm brown\nRow 2: david burke\nRow 3: david cowling\nRow 4: brian cox\nRow 5: maurice cox\nRow 6: steve doyle\nRow 7: roy greenwood\nRow 8: keith hanvey\nRow 9: timothy hotte\nRow 10: mick laverick\nRow 11: mark lillis\nRow 12: keith mason\nRow 13: daral pugh\nRow 14: colin russell\nRow 15: brian stanton\nRow 16: kevin stonehouse\nRow 17: dave sutton\nRow 18: peter valentine\nRow 19: phil wilson\n\nSo, dave sutton is at row 17. The \"league apps\" column is the third element (index 2) in each row's data array.\n\nLooking at row 17: [\"dave sutton\", \"df\", \"41\", ...]. So league apps are 41.\n\nNow, for phil wilson: he's at row 19. His league apps are the third element, which is 45 (since it says \"45\" in the data).\n\nWait, no\u2014let me check again. Phil Wilson's data is [\"phil wilson\", \"mf\", \"45\", ...]. So his league apps are 45.\n\nThe claim states both have 44 league apps. But dave sutton has 41 and phil wilson has 45. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nSo, relevant cells are:\n\n- For dave sutton: row index 17, column \"league apps\"\n- For phil wilson: row index 19, column \"league apps\"\n\nI should list these in the relevant_cells array.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"league apps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"league apps\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
