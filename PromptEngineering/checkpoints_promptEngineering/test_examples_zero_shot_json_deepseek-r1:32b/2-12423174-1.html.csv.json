    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"asc diaraf lose to stade malien in the 1971 african cup of champion club\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that asc diaraf lost against stade malien in a competition known as the 1971 African Cup of Champion Clubs. \n\nLooking at the table provided, I see it has columns: team 1, agg, team 2, 1st leg, and 2nd leg. Each row represents a match between two teams with their aggregate scores and the results of each leg.\n\nI need to check if asc diaraf and stade malien are in any of these matches and what the outcome was. Let me scan through the data rows.\n\nRow indices go from 0 to 8. Scanning each row:\n\n- Row 2 has \"asc diaraf\" as team 1 and \"stade malien\" as team 2. The aggregate score is listed as \"3 - 4\". In the 1st leg, asc diaraf won 3-0, but in the 2nd leg, they lost 0-4. The total aggregate would be 3+0 (asc) vs. 0+4 (stade), so 3-4. That means stade malien won.\n\nThe claim says \"lose,\" which is correct because asc diaraf's aggregate score was lower than stade malien's. So the result supports the claim that asc diaraf lost to stade malien.\n\nNow, about the competition being the African Cup of Champion Clubs in 1971. The table doesn't specify the year or the exact competition name. However, given the context and the format, it's reasonable to assume this table refers to matches from that competition around 1971, as the data seems to fit that period.\n\nTherefore, based on the aggregate score showing asc diaraf losing to stade malien, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are team 1 and team 2 in row 2, where asc diaraf and stade malien's match shows the latter won.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Teams:** Locate rows involving \"asc diaraf\" and \"stade malien.\"\n2. **Check Result:** In row index 2, team 1 is asc diaraf (3) vs. stade malien (4) in aggregate.\n3. **Determine Outcome:** Since 3 < 4, asc diaraf lost.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. The claim states: \"the young african score 2 point in the 1971 african cup of champion club.\" So, it's about Young Africans scoring 2 points in a specific competition.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a match between two teams with details like aggregate scores and the results of the first and second legs. The columns are \"team 1\", \"agg\", \"team 2\", \"1st leg\", and \"2nd leg\".\n\nI need to check if Young Africans appear in the table and whether they scored 2 points as mentioned. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. First row: al-merrikh vs tele sc asmara. Not relevant.\n2. Second row: abaluhya united vs great olympics. Not relevant.\n3. Third row: asc diaraf vs stade malien. No mention of Young Africans.\n4. Fourth row: maseru united vs mmm tamatave. Still not relevant.\n5. Fifth row: as porto novo vs victoria club mokanda. Nope.\n6. Sixth row: canon yaound\u00e9 vs as solidarit\u00e9. Not related.\n7. Seventh row: esp\u00e9rance vs al-ahly (benghazi). No.\n8. Eighth row: secteur 6 vs enugu rangers. Still not relevant.\n9. Ninth row: young africans vs lavori publici.\n\nOkay, so the ninth row is about Young Africans. Let's look at the details here:\n\n- team 1: young africans\n- agg (aggregate): 2 - 0\n- team 2: lavori publici\n- 1st leg: 2 - 0\n- 2nd leg: 0 - 0\n\nThe aggregate score is 2-0, which means Young Africans scored a total of 2 goals across both legs. In the first leg, they scored all 2 goals, and in the second leg, there was no additional scoring from their side.\n\nNow, the claim says they \"score 2 point.\" Wait, points or goals? The table shows goals, not points. So, if the claim is about goals, then it's correct: Young Africans scored 2 goals (aggregate). However, if it's about points, that's a different story because in football, a win gives 3 points, a draw gives 1, etc. But looking at the data, the aggregate result was 2-0, which would mean they won and thus got 3 points for the match.\n\nBut wait, the claim specifically says \"2 point.\" So if it's about goals, then yes, they scored 2. If it's about points, that's incorrect because a win is 3 points, not 2. However, the term used in the table is \"agg,\" which stands for aggregate goals.\n\nSo, the claim might be mixing up points and goals. The relevant cells are the team name and their aggregate score. Let me check the row index: it's the ninth row, so row_8 (since indexing starts at 0). The columns needed are \"team 1\" and \"agg\".\n\nTherefore, Young Africans scored 2 goals in total (aggregate), but if the claim refers to points, that would be incorrect. However, since the table doesn't provide points information, just goals, we can only verify based on goals.\n\nThe claim says they scored 2 points, which is ambiguous. But given that the aggregate shows 2 goals, it's likely a misunderstanding. So, I need to determine if \"score 2 point\" refers to goals or actual points in the competition.\n\nSince the table doesn't have points columns, but only goals, perhaps the claim is incorrect because they might have earned more points based on their win. However, without points data, it's hard to confirm. Alternatively, maybe the claim is correct if \"point\" was meant as goals.\n\nI think the key here is that Young Africans did score 2 goals in total (aggregate), which matches the claim if we interpret \"point\" as goal. But usually, points and goals are different. So, perhaps the claim is a bit confusing.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but considering the data shows they scored 2 goals, I think the answer would be TRUE because their aggregate was 2-0, meaning they scored 2 goals.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the table. The columns are \"team 1\", \"agg\", \"team 2\", \"1st leg\", and \"2nd leg\". Each row represents a match between two teams, showing their aggregate score and the scores from each leg of the match.\n\nThe claim is about \"secteur 6\" losing by 1 against \"enugu rangers.\" So I need to find the relevant row in the table where one of the teams is \"secteur 6.\"\n\nLooking through the data array:\n\n- The first few rows don't mention \"secteur 6.\"\n- Scanning each row, I find that the 7th row (index starting at 0) has \"secteur 6\" as team 1 and \"enugu rangers\" as team 2. Let me verify that: Yes, row index 7 has [\"secteur 6\", \"1 - 2\", \"enugu rangers\", \"1 - 1\", \"0 - 1\"].\n\nNow, checking the aggregate score (agg column): It's \"1 - 2\". This means secteur 6 scored 1 and enugu rangers scored 2 in total. So the result is a loss for secteur 6 by a margin of 1 goal.\n\nThe claim says they lost by 1 against enugu rangers, which matches the data here. The first leg was 1-1, and the second leg was 0-1, so overall it's 1-2 in favor of enugu rangers.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- team 1: \"secteur 6\" at row index 7.\n- agg score: \"1 - 2\" at row index 7.\n- team 2: \"enugu rangers\" at row index 7.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE.

The data includes multiple rows with each row representing a match between two teams. Each row shows the aggregate score (agg) and the scores from the first and second legs.\n\nLooking at the claim, it mentions \"as porto novo\" and \"victoria club mokanda\". I need to find if these two teams played against each other in the table. Scanning through the data rows:\n\n- The fifth row has team 1 as \"as porto novo\" and team 2 as \"victoria club mokanda\". So this is the relevant row.\n\nIn that row, under the 'agg' column, it shows \"0 - 3\". That means the aggregate score for as porto novo was 0 points against victoria club mokanda. Additionally, looking at the first leg and second leg scores:\n\n- First leg: 0 - 1\n- Second leg: 0 - 2\n\nBoth legs show that as porto novo didn't score any goals.

Scanning the \"team 1\" and \"team 2\" columns, I see that \"canon yaound\u00e9\" is listed as team 1 in one of the rows. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 0: al-merrikh vs tele sc asmara - not relevant.\nRow 1: abaluhya united vs great olympics - nope.\nRow 2: asc diaraf vs stade malien - nope.\nRow 3: maseru united vs mmm tamatave - no.\nRow 4: as porto novo vs victoria club mokanda - no.\nRow 5: canon yaound\u00e9 vs as solidarit\u00e9 - yes, this is the relevant row.\n\nNow, I need to check the scores in this row.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. The claim states that asc diaraf won their match against stade malien in a specific competition\u2014the 1971 African Cup of Champions Club. I'm not sure about the exact year because the table doesn't specify years, but I'll focus on whether asc diaraf won against stade malien.\n\nLooking at the table structure: it has columns \"team 1\", \"agg\", \"team 2\", \"1st leg\", and \"2nd leg\". The data rows contain the team names and their respective scores. Each row represents a match between two teams, with results from both legs (home and away) as well as an aggregate score that includes penalties if necessary.\n\nI need to find the row where asc diaraf is playing against stade malien. Scanning through the data rows:\n\n1. The first row: al-merrikh vs tele sc asmara.\n2. Second: abaluhya united vs great olympics.\n3. Third: asc diaraf vs stade malien. Ah, here it is.\n\nSo, looking at this third row (row index 2), team1 is asc diaraf and team2 is stade malien. The aggregate score in the \"agg\" column is 3-4. That means, overall, asc diaraf scored 3 goals, and stade malien scored 4. Therefore, stade malien won this match.\n\nThe claim says that asc diaraf won against stade malien, but according to the aggregate score of 3-4 in favor of stade malien, the claim is incorrect.\n\nAdditionally, checking the first leg and second leg scores might give more context. The first leg was 3-0 in favor of asc diaraf, which suggests they won their home game. However, the second leg was 0-4 for asc diaraf, meaning stade malien scored four goals away, turning the aggregate around.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the claim is about a win by asc diaraf against stade malien in 1971. The table shows that while they won the first leg, the second leg and overall aggregate were lost to stade malien. Therefore, asc diaraf did not win the match; instead, they lost.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because asc diaraf lost to stade malien in the aggregate score of 3-4.

Each row represents a match between two teams, with their aggregate scores and the results of each leg.\n\nThe claim mentions \"secteur 6\" and \"enugu ranger.\" I'll need to find if there's a match where these two teams are playing against each other.

Here, \"secteur 6\" is team 1 and \"enugu rangers\" is team 2. The aggregate score in the \"agg\" column is \"1 - 2\".

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that Young Africans scored zero points in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Club. Points here likely refer to their score in a match or maybe points accumulated through wins, draws, and losses. However, looking at the table structure, it seems each row represents a match between two teams with details about the aggregate score, first leg, and second leg.\n\nThe columns in the table are: \"team 1\", \"agg\", \"team 2\", \"1st leg\", \"2nd leg\". The data shows various matches. I need to find if Young Africans participated and what their scores were.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: al - merrikh vs tele sc asmara\n- Row 1: abaluhya united vs great olympics\n- Row 2: asc diaraf vs stade malien\n- Row 3: maseru united vs mmm tamatave\n- Row 4: as porto novo vs victoria club mokanda\n- Row 5: canon yaound\u00e9 vs as solidarit\u00e9\n- Row 6: esp\u00e9rance vs al - ahly (benghazi)\n- Row 7: secteur 6 vs enugu rangers\n- Row 8: young africans vs lavori publici\n\nSo Young Africans are in row 8. The aggregate score is \"2 - 0\", meaning they scored 2 goals and allowed 0. In the first leg, it's \"2 - 0\" as well, and the second leg is \"0 - 0\". \n\nThe claim says they scored zero points. If we interpret this as goals, then in the aggregate, they scored 2, so that would make the claim false. However, if \"points\" refer to something else, like in terms of a championship points system where a win gives 3 points, a draw gives 1, etc., but I don't think the table provides information on points accumulation beyond the scores.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to zero goals in either leg or aggregate. But according to row 8, their score was 2-0 in the first leg and 0-0 in the second leg. So in the first leg, they scored 2, and in the second leg, neither team scored.\n\nSo the claim says they scored zero points overall. If we take \"points\" as goals, then it's not accurate because they scored 2 goals in the first leg. If it's about a specific match (like the second leg), maybe, but that's not clear from the claim.\n\nTherefore, based on the table, Young Africans did score goals (2 in the first leg), so the claim that they scored zero points is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Young Africans scored zero points.

This means they lost both legs: first leg 0-1 and second leg 0-2. So, their total points from this match would be 0 since they lost both legs.\n\nThe claim says \"score 3 point,\" which suggests that as porto novo earned 3 points in this match. But according to the table, they didn't score any points because they lost. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"canon yaound\u00e9 score zero point against their opponent\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to locate the row where \"canon yaound\u00e9\" is mentioned. Looking at the data array in the JSON, I see that each row has five elements: team 1, agg, team 2, 1st leg, and 2nd leg. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: al - merrikh vs tele sc asmara\n- Row 1: abaluhya united vs great olympics\n- Row 2: asc diaraf vs stade malien\n- Row 3: maseru united vs mmm tamatave\n- Row 4: as porto novo vs victoria club mokanda\n- Row 5: canon yaound\u00e9 vs as solidarit\u00e9\n\nOkay, so \"canon yaound\u00e9\" is in row 5. Now, looking at the 'agg' column for that row, it's \"9  - 4\". That means in the aggregate (total points), canon yaound\u00e9 scored 9 points and their opponent scored 4.\n\nWait a minute, but the claim says they scored zero points. That doesn't match because 9 is not zero. Also, looking at both legs:\n\n- 1st leg: 7 - 3\n- 2nd leg: 2 - 1\n\nSo in each leg, canon yaound\u00e9 scored 7 and then 2, which adds up to 9 total. Therefore, the claim that they scored zero points is definitely false.\n\nI think the mistake here might be confusing the team names or misunderstanding the columns. Maybe someone thought 'agg' was something else, but no, it clearly shows the aggregate score. So all relevant cells point to canon yaound\u00e9 scoring more than zero.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"canon yaound\u00e9\" scored zero points against their opponent. From the table, in row 5 under the 'agg' column, \"canon yaound\u00e9\" has a score of 9-4, indicating they scored 9 points. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n1. Locate the row for \"canon yaound\u00e9\".\n2. Check the 'agg' column which shows their total score.\n3. Since their aggregate score is 9 points, not zero, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
