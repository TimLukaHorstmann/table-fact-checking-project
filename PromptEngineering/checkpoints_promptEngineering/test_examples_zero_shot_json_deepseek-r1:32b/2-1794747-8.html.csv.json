    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided in JSON format. The claim states: \"imelda staunton win the laurence olivier award for best actress in a musical category in 2013.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the table. The columns are year, award ceremony, category, nominee, and result. There are several rows of data.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: 2012, evening standard award, best musical, best musical, won.\nThis is about a different award in 2012, so not relevant.\n\nRow 1: 2013, laurence olivier award, best musical revival, best musical revival, won. Again, same year and ceremony but the category is best musical revival, which isn't what we're looking for.\n\nRow 2: 2013, laurence olivier award, best actor in a musical, michael ball, won.\nThis is about an actor, not actress, so not relevant.\n\nRow 3: 2013, laurence olivier award, best actress in a musical, imelda staunton, won.\nThis matches the claim exactly. The year is correct (2013), the award ceremony is Laurence Olivier Award, category is best actress in a musical, nominee is Imelda Staunton, and result is 'won'.\n\nRows 4-6: These are about other categories in 2013 for Laurence Olivier Awards but they're either nominated or different categories like costume design, lighting, sound.\n\nSo the relevant row is index 3. The claim matches all details correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately reflects the data in row 3 of the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"award ceremony\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"imelda staunton be the nominee in 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It's stating that Imelda Staunton was a nominee in the year 2012. So, I'm looking for any entry where \"nominee\" is \"imelda staunton\" and \"year\" is 2012.\n\nLooking at the table data:\n\n- The first row has the year 2012. The award ceremony is \"evening standard award\", category is \"best musical\", nominee is \"best musical\", and result is \"won\". So, Imelda isn't mentioned here.\n  \n- Rows from 2013: There are multiple entries. In row index 2, the nominee is Michael Ball for best actor in a musical. In row index 3, the nominee is Imelda Staunton for best actress in a musical, and she won.\n\nWait, so Imelda was a nominee in 2013, not 2012. The claim mentions 2012, but the data shows her nomination in 2013. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are the ones where year is 2012 and where the nominee is Imelda Staunton to cross-check if she was nominated that year.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
