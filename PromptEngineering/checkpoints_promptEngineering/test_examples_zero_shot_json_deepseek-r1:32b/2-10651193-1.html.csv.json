    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine whether the claim \"there be no player draft from tennessee state with a rank lower than 261\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is saying that there are no players drafted from Tennessee State University who have an overall rank (I assume \"overall\" refers to the draft pick number) lower than 261. So, in other words, all players drafted from Tennessee State must have a rank equal to or higher than 261.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has columns: round, overall, player, position, and school/club team. The rows contain data about each player's draft details. \n\nI'll go through each row to find any players from Tennessee State. Scanning the \"school / club team\" column:\n\n- Row 0: Houston\n- Row 1: Wisconsin\n- Row 2: Oklahoma\n- Row 3: Kentucky\n- Row 4: Colorado\n- Row 5: USC\n- Row 6: LSU\n- Row 7: Minnesota\n- Row 8: Texas A&M\n- Row 9: San Diego State\n- Row 10: Duke\n- Row 11: Mississippi\n- Row 12: Tennessee State\n- Row 13: Nebraska\n- Row 14: Tulane\n\nSo, the only player from Tennessee State is in row 12. Let me check the details of that row:\n\nRow 12:\n- round: 10\n- overall: 261\n- player: john henry smith\n- position: wide receiver\n- school / club team: tennessee state\n\nThe overall rank for this player is exactly 261. The claim states \"no player draft from Tennessee State with a rank lower than 261.\" Since the only player from Tennessee State has an overall rank equal to 261, there are no players from that school with a lower rank.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there's no one drafted from Tennessee State below rank 261. The relevant cell here is row 12, specifically the \"overall\" column and the \"school / club team\" column to confirm both the rank and the school.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}, {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"}]}",
