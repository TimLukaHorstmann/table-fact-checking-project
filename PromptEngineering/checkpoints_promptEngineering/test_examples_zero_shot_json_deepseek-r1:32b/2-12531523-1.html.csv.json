    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine if the claim \"mike weir have not win with under par for the nasters tournament,\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the table data provided in JSON format. The columns are: player, country, year(s) won, total, to par, and finish. There are seven rows of data corresponding to different players.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions Mike Weir. So, I should look for his row in the data. Scanning through the \"player\" column, I find Mike Weir's entry in the fourth row (row index 3 if we start counting from 0).\n\nNow, the key part of the claim is about Mike Weir not winning with under par. To verify this, I need to check two things: whether he won and what his \"to par\" score was during that win.\n\nLooking at Mike Weir's row, the \"year(s) won\" column shows \"2003,\" which indicates that he did win in 2003. So, he has a win under his belt.\n\nNext, I need to examine the \"to par\" column for Mike Weir. The value there is \"+ 2.\" In golf, \"to par\" refers to how many strokes above or below the course's par the player finished. A negative number means they were under par, while a positive number means they were over par.\n\nSince Mike Weir's \"to par\" is +2, that means he was two strokes over par when he won in 2003. The claim states that he did not win with an under par score, which aligns with this data because his score was above par (+2) during his victory.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. Mike Weir's win in 2003 was achieved with a score that was over par, so he didn't win while being under par.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year  (s) won\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"in the master tournament, tiger wood have win the most time out of all player\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Tiger Woods has won the Master Tournament more times than any other player listed in the table. So my task is to check how many wins each player has and compare them, especially focusing on Tiger Woods' number of wins.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are columns: \"player\", \"country\", \"year(s) won\", \"total\", \"to par\", and \"finish\". The relevant column for determining the number of wins is \"year(s) won\".\n\nNow, let's go through each row to count how many times each player has won:\n\n1. **Tiger Woods**: The years listed are 1997, 2001, 2002, and 2005. That's four separate wins.\n2. **Phil Mickelson**: Years are 2004 and 2006. Two wins.\n3. **Vijay Singh**: Only the year 2000 is listed. One win.\n4. **Mike Weir**: The year 2003. One win.\n5. **Zach Johnson**: The year 2007. One win.\n6. **Ian Woosnam**: The year 1991. One win.\n7. **Sandy Lyle**: The year 1988. One win.\n\nSo, Tiger Woods has four wins, which is more than any other player in the table.

It mentions that Phil Mickelson has two wins and that he has won more times than Zach Johnson. So I need to check how many times each of them has won.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant column for the number of wins is \"year(s) won\". Each row lists the years in which the player won. \n\nFor Phil Mickelson, his row index is 1. The \"year(s) won\" column shows \"2004 , 2006\", so he has two win years: 2004 and 2006. That means he has won twice.\n\nZach Johnson's row is at index 4, and his \"year(s) won\" is listed as \"2007\". So he only has one win year, which means one win.\n\nComparing the two, Phil has two wins and Zach has one. Therefore, the claim that Phil has more wins than Zach is correct. \n\nNow, to list the relevant cells. For Phil Mickelson, I need the row index 1 and the column \"year(s) won\".

The claim says, \"the united state have have 3 player win in the master tournament.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are a few typos in the claim: \"have have\" should probably be \"has had,\" but I think it's just a mistake. The main point is whether the United States has three players who won the Masters Tournament based on the data given.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player and their performance. There are seven rows in total. Each row includes details like the player's name, country, years they won, etc. I need to focus on two columns: \"player\" and \"country,\" specifically looking for entries where the country is \"united states.\"\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Player is Tiger Woods, from the United States. He has multiple wins listed in \"year(s) won.\" So this counts as one US player.\n2. **Row 1**: Phil Mickelson is also from the United States. Another win here; that's two US players.\n3. **Row 4**: Zach Johnson is another US player, so that makes three.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Rows 0, 1, and 4 are all from the United States. Each of them has at least one year listed in \"year(s) won.\" Tiger Woods has four wins, Phil two, and Zach one. The claim says there are three players from the US who have won.\n\nBut wait, looking again: Row 0 is Tiger (US), Row1 Phil (US), and then others are Vijay Singh (Fiji), Mike Weir (Canada), Ian Woosnam (Wales), Sandy Lyle (Scotland). So only Tiger, Phil, and Zach are from the US. That's three players.\n\nSo the claim says that the United States has three players who have won in the Masters. According to the table, this is accurate because there are three entries where the country is the United States and they have corresponding wins.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are those indicating their countries being the US for these three players.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the United States has three players who won in the Masters.

Let me start by understanding the claim: \"vijay singh have a final total win that be 13 under the score sandy lyle have when she win.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for both players in the table.\n\nVijay Singh is listed as row index 2. His 'total' is 289 and 'to par' is \"+ 1\". Sandy Lyle is in row index 6 with a 'total' of 302 and 'to par' of \"+ 14\".\n\nWait, the claim says Vijay's score was 13 under Sandy's. Let me check their totals: Vijay has 289, Sandy has 302. The difference is 302 - 289 = 13. So yes, Vijay's total is 13 less than Sandy's.\n\nHowever, I should also consider the 'to par' column. Vijay was +1 and Sandy was +14. That means Sandy finished 14 over par, while Vijay was only 1 over. But the claim specifically mentions their final totals, not just to par. Since the total scores directly support the claim, it's TRUE.\n\nI need to note the relevant cells: Vijay's 'total' and Sandy's 'total'.

The claim says, \"In the master tournament, Tiger Wood win 1 less time than Phil Mickelson do.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It seems to be comparing the number of times Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson have won the Masters tournament. Specifically, it claims that Tiger won one fewer time than Phil. \n\nLooking at the table, there are two relevant columns here: \"player\" and \"year(s) won\". The player names are in the first column, so I can identify each row by their player name. The \"year(s) won\" column shows how many times each player has won the tournament based on the listed years.\n\nLet's look at Tiger Woods' entry. In the table, under the \"player\" column, Tiger Woods is listed with the years 1997, 2001, 2002, and 2005. That means he has won four times. \n\nNext, Phil Mickelson's row shows his wins in 2004 and 2006, which are two separate entries. So Phil has won twice.\n\nNow, the claim says Tiger won one less time than Phil. Wait, but according to the table, Tiger has four wins and Phil has two. That would mean Tiger actually won more times, not fewer. So if the claim is that Tiger's wins are one less than Phil's, that doesn't add up because 4 is not equal to (2 -1) which is 1.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect based on the data provided in the table. The relevant cells here would be the \"year(s) won\" for both Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson so we can count their respective wins.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Tiger Woods has one fewer win than Phil Mickelson in the Masters tournament. However, according to the table, Tiger Woods has four wins (in 1997, 2001, 2002, and 2005), while Phil Mickelson has two wins (in 2004 and 2006). Therefore, the claim is false because Tiger actually has more wins than Phil.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year  (s) won\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year  (s) won\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The relevant information here would be the number of wins each player has.\n\nLooking at Phil Mickelson's row (row index 1), under \"year(s) won\" it says \"2004 , 2006\". That means he has two win years listed, so two wins.\n\nNow, looking at Zach Johnson's row (row index 5), under the same column, it just says \"2007\". So that's one win for him.\n\nThe claim states Phil has four more wins than Zach. Let me check: if Phil has 2 wins and Zach has 1, does that mean Phil has four more? No, because 2 minus 1 is only 1 more win. \n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the years. Phil's years are listed as \"2004 , 2006\"\u2014that's two distinct years, so two wins. Zach's year is just one.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"the united state have 2 player who win during the master tournament.\" First, I need to understand what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the data in the table.\n\nThe claim mentions two main points:\n1. Players from the United States.\n2. Two such players who won during the Masters Tournament.\n\nLooking at the JSON table provided, it has columns: player, country, year(s) won, total, to par, finish. The relevant columns for this claim are \"country\" and \"year(s) won.\" \n\nI'll start by identifying all players from the United States. Scanning through each row:\n- Tiger Woods is from the United States.\n- Phil Mickelson is also from the United States.\n- Vijay Singh is from Fiji.\n- Mike Weir is from Canada.\n- Zach Johnson is from the United States.\n- Ian Woosnam is from Wales.\n- Sandy Lyle is from Scotland.\n\nSo, in total, we have three players from the United States: Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, and Zach Johnson. However, the claim states that there are only two such players. That discrepancy suggests the claim might be false.\n\nNext, I need to verify how many of these U.S. players won during their respective years. Looking at \"year(s) won\":\n- Tiger Woods: 1997, 2001, 2002, 2005 \u2013 multiple wins.\n- Phil Mickelson: 2004, 2006 \u2013 two wins.\n- Zach Johnson: 2007 \u2013 one win.\n\nWait a minute. The claim is about the number of players who won, not the number of times they won. So Tiger Woods is one player with multiple wins, Phil is another with two, and Zach has one. That makes three U.S. players who have won at least once each.\n\nBut the claim says there are two such players. Since the table shows three, the claim isn't accurate. Therefore, it should be FALSE.\n\nNow, to gather the relevant cells:\n- For Tiger Woods: row 0, column \"country\" and \"year(s) won.\"\n- Phil Mickelson: row 1, same columns.\n- Zach Johnson: row 4, same columns.\n\nBut since we're checking for U.S. players with wins, all three are relevant to show that there's more than two. However, the claim specifically mentions two, so we might need to highlight the first two or all three depending on how it's interpreted. But in this case, focusing on Tiger and Phil as examples where both are from the U.S. and have won would suffice to show the claim is false because there are more than two.\n\nWait, actually, no\u2014the claim says \"2 player,\" so if we find even one more beyond that, it's false.

It seems like there might be some typos, but I think it means that Vijay Singh's final score was more than 10 strokes better (or lower) than Sandy Lyle's score. In golf terms, being \"under\" usually refers to being below par, so a lower number is better.\n\nLooking at the table columns: \"total\" and \"to par\". The \"to par\" column shows how much each player was over or under par. So, for Vijay Singh, the \"to par\" is \"+1\", meaning he was 1 stroke over par.

So, if we calculate the difference between their scores: Vijay was +1 and Sandy was +14. The difference in their performance would be Sandy's score minus Vijay's score: 14 - 1 = 13 strokes. But wait, is that how it works? Actually, being \"under\" would mean a negative number. Wait, no\u2014if both are over par, then the comparison is about how much better Vijay did compared to Sandy.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says Vijay's score is less than 10 under Sandy's. Hmm, perhaps it means that Vijay's score was more than 10 strokes better (i.e., lower) than Sandy's. So, if Vijay is +1 and Sandy is +14, the difference is 13 strokes. Since 13 is more than 10, then Vijay's score is indeed more than 10 strokes under (better than) Sandy's.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, in golf, a lower number is better because it means you're closer to par. So, if Vijay was +1 and Sandy was +14, the difference in their scores is 13 strokes. Therefore, Vijay's score is 13 strokes better than Sandy's. Since 13 is more than 10, the claim that his score is less than 10 under would be false because it's actually more than 10.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The phrase \"less than 10 under\" might mean that Vijay's final score was better (lower) by more than 10 strokes compared to Sandy's. But let's look at the data: Vijay has a total of 289, and Sandy has 302. So the difference is 302 - 289 = 13 strokes. That means Vijay scored 13 strokes better than Sandy. Since 13 is more than 10, the claim that it's \"less than 10 under\" would be incorrect because it's actually more than 10.\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim says \"vijay singh have a final score that be less than 10 under the score of sandy lyle.\" So if Vijay is better by more than 10 strokes, then his score is not less than 10 under Sandy's. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting it again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"under\" refers to being below par, so Vijay was +1 (over) and Sandy was +14. The difference in their performance relative to each other would be the absolute difference between their \"to par\" scores. So 14 - (-1) = 15? Wait, no, because both are over. So maybe it's just 14 - 1 = 13 strokes.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the \"total\" column instead. Vijay has a total of 289 and Sandy has 302. The difference is 302 - 289 = 13. So Vijay's score was 13 strokes lower than Sandy's. Therefore, the claim says it's less than 10, but it's actually 13, which is more than 10. Hence, the claim would be FALSE.\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim says \"less than 10 under,\" so if it's 13 under, that would mean it's more than 10, making the claim false because it's not less than 10. Wait, I'm getting tangled up here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider \"under\" as being better than par. So, for example, a player with -5 is 5 strokes under par, which is good. Vijay was +1 (over), Sandy was +14. The difference between their scores relative to each other would be the difference in their \"to par\" values: 14 - 1 = 13. So Vijay's score was better by 13 strokes compared to Sandy. Therefore, since 13 is more than 10, the claim that it's less than 10 under would be false.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE because the difference is 13, which is more than 10. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are Vijay Singh's \"to par\" and Sandy Lyle's \"to par.\" The difference in their scores is 14 - 1 = 13, which is more than 10.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
