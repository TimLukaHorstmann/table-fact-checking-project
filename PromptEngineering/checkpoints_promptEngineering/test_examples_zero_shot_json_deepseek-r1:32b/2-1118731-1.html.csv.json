    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the power of the 1972 engine be not give in hp (kw)\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It states that for the 1972 engine, the power isn't given in horsepower (HP) or kilowatts (KW). So I'm looking to see if the 'power' column for the 1972 entry is either missing or indicates that it's not provided.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are \"generation\", \"years\", \"engine\", \"power\", \"torque\", and \"induction\". The relevant data points will be in these columns. Specifically, I need to focus on rows where the 'years' include 1972 and check the corresponding 'power' entries.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Years 1971, power is '-', which likely means not provided.\n- Row 1: Years 1971-1973. Since this includes 1972, I'll note it. The power here is also '-'.\n- Row 2: Specifically 1972, and the power is '-' as well.\n\nSo rows 0, 1, and 2 have 'power' as '-'. This suggests that for all entries where 1972 is mentioned, the power isn't provided in HP or KW. Therefore, the claim seems to hold true based on these data points.\n\nTo confirm, I'll cross-verify each row:\n\nRow 0: years \"1971\" \u2013 doesn't include 1972.\nWait, no\u2014row 1 has \"1971 - 1973\", which does include 1972. Rows 0 and 2 are also relevant because row 0 is for 1971 but might be part of the same engine line. However, since each row represents a separate entry, I need to consider only those that explicitly mention 1972 or include it in their year range.\n\nSo rows 1, 2, and 5 (which goes up to 1976) also include 1972 but looking at the data:\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine the data array:\n\nLooking again, row indices are from 0 to 15.\n\nRows with years including 1972:\n\n- Row 1: \"1971 - 1973\" includes 1972.\n- Row 2: \"1972\" exactly.\n\nSo both rows 1 and 2 have 'power' as '-'. This means for the engines in those years, power isn't provided. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because wherever the year 1972 appears, the power value is not given (it's '-' or \"n/a\"), which aligns with the claim.\n\nI should also check if any other rows might include 1972 but looking at the rest:\n\nRow 3: 1974.\nRow 4: 1975.\nRow 5: 1975-1976. So no, only rows 1 and 2 are relevant.\n\nThus, since in both cases where 1972 is mentioned, the power isn't provided, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"power\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"power\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
