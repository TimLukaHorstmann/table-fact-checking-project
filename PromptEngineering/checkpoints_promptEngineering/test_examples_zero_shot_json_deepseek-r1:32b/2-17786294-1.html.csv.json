    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the claim \"as monaco score the most goal in the round of 16 in the 1983 - 84 coupe de france\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It states that AS Monaco scored the most goals in the round of 16 during the specified Coupe de France season. So, my goal is to verify if this statement holds true using the data given in the JSON table.\n\nLooking at the structure of the table:\n- The columns are: \"team 1\", \"score\", \"team 2\", \"1st round\", \"2nd round\".\n- Each row represents a match between two teams, with their respective scores in different rounds.\n\nI need to identify which rows correspond to AS Monaco. Scanning through the data:\n\nRow index 2:\n- team 1: as monaco (d1)\n- score: 6 - 1\n- team 2: as nancy (d1)\n- 1st round: 2 - 0\n- 2nd round: 4 - 1\n\nThis row shows that AS Monaco played against AS Nancy. In the first round, they scored 2 goals, and in the second round, they added another 4 goals, totaling 6 goals.\n\nNow, I should check if there are any other teams that might have scored more than 6 goals in the same round of 16. Looking through all rows:\n\n- Row 0: rc lens vs rc strasbourg \u2192 scores are 1-0 and 0-0\n- Row 1: fc rouen vs stade lavallois \u2192 scores are 2-4 and 1-3\n- Row 3: girondins de bordeaux vs fc mulhouse \u2192 2-3 and 2-2\n- Row 4: fc nantes vs olympique lyonnais \u2192 4-4 and 4-4\n- Row 5: as cannes vs fc sochaux-montb\u00e9liard \u2192 4-1 and 1-1\n- Row 6: sporting toulon var vs en avant guingamp \u2192 2-1 and 0-1\n- Row 7: fc metz vs besan\u00e7on rc \u2192 5-1 and 1-1\n\nIn all these rows, the highest score in a single round is 4 goals (e.g., row 4's second round). Comparing this to AS Monaco's 6 goals across both rounds, it seems they scored more than any other team mentioned.\n\nHowever, I should consider if \"round of 16\" refers to the total across all matches or just a specific round. The table lists two rounds: 1st and 2nd. If \"round of 16\" is referring to the cumulative goals in both rounds for AS Monaco, their total is indeed the highest at 6 goals.\n\nAdditionally, I should confirm if there's any ambiguity about the competition or season. The claim mentions the Coupe de France 1983-84, but the table doesn't specify the competition or season directly. However, since we're only given this data to work with, it's reasonable to assume that all matches in the table are from that specific Coupe de France round.\n\nTherefore, based on the data provided, AS Monaco did score the most goals in their respective rounds.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1st round\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2nd round\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"there be 2 scoreless legs - the second round of rc lens vs rc strasbourg , and the first round of fc nantes vs olympique lyonnais.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down what a \"scoreless leg\" means. In sports, especially football matches, a scoreless leg would mean that no goals were scored in that particular round or match part. So, I'm looking for rounds where both teams have zero goals.\n\nLooking at the table structure: The columns are \"team 1\", \"score\", \"team 2\", \"1st round\", and \"2nd round\". Each row represents a different match between two teams, with their scores in each round provided.\n\nNow, let's identify the specific matches mentioned in the claim:\n\n1. RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg: I need to check both the first and second rounds for this match.\n2. FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais: Similarly, I'll check their first and second rounds.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0:\n- Team 1: rc lens (d1)\n- Team 2: rc strasbourg (d1)\nLooking at \"score\": \"1 - 0\" which is the overall match score. The \"1st round\" is \"1 - 0\", and \"2nd round\" is \"0 - 0\".\n\nSo, for RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg:\n- First round: 1-0 (not scoreless)\n- Second round: 0-0 (scoreless)\n\nRow 4:\n- Team 1: fc nantes (d1)\n- Team 2: olympique lyonnais (d2)\nScore is \"4 - 4\", which seems like the overall result. The \"1st round\" is \"0 - 0\", and \"2nd round\" is also \"4 - 4\".\n\nSo, for FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais:\n- First round: 0-0 (scoreless)\n- Second round: 4-4 (not scoreless)\n\nThe claim mentions two specific rounds:\n1. The second round of RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg: This was \"0 - 0\" \u2013 that's a scoreless leg.\n2. The first round of FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais: Also \"0 - 0\" \u2013 another scoreless leg.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are correct. There are indeed two scoreless legs as mentioned.\n\nNow, I need to note the relevant cells that support this conclusion.\n\nFor RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg (row 0):\n- The second round is column \"2nd round\", which has a value of \"0 - 0\".\n\nFor FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais (row 4):\n- The first round is column \"1st round\", which also shows \"0 - 0\".\n\nSo, the relevant cells are row 0's \"2nd round\" and row 4's \"1st round\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly identifies two scoreless legs in the specified matches.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2nd round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim about FC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnais is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim first.\n\nThe claim says: \"FC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnaise tie on aggregate with a score of 4-4, requiring the match to be decided by the away goal rule.\"\n\nOkay, so I need to check two main things here:\n1. Did FC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnais indeed tie with an aggregate score of 4-4?\n2. Does this tie mean that the match was decided by the away goal rule?\n\nFirst, let's look at the table provided in JSON format. The columns are \"team 1\", \"score\", \"team 2\", \"1st round\", and \"2nd round\". Each row represents a match between two teams, showing their scores in each round.\n\nI need to find the row where both FC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnais are involved. Scanning through the data array:\n\nLooking at each row:\n- Row 0: RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg\n- Row 1: FC Rouen vs Stade Lavallois\n- Row 2: AS Monaco vs AS Nancy\n- Row 3: Girondins de Bordeaux vs FC Mulhouse (D2)\n- Row 4: FC Nantes (D1) vs Olympique Lyonnais (D2)\n- Row 5: AS Cannes (D2) vs FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard (D1)\n- Row 6: Sporting Toulon Var vs En Avant Guingamp (D2)\n- Row 7: FC Metz vs Besan\u00e7on RC (D2)\n\nSo, row index 4 is the one we're interested in. Let's examine that row:\n\nTeam 1: \"fc nantes (d1)\"\nScore: \"4 - 4\"\nTeam 2: \"olympique lyonnais (d2)\"\n1st round: \"0 - 0\"\n2nd round: \"4 - 4\"\n\nWait, the score column is \"4 - 4\", which suggests that in total, both teams scored four goals each. So their aggregate score is tied at 4-4.\n\nNow, looking into the rounds:\n- In the 1st round, it's a 0-0 draw.\n- In the 2nd round, again it's 4-4.\n\nHmm, that's interesting because in football (soccer), if the scores are tied after both legs, sometimes they go to extra time or penalties. But the claim mentions the away goal rule.\n\nThe away goal rule states that if two teams have the same aggregate score over two matches, the team with more goals scored away from home wins. So we need to check if in this case, either FC Nantes or Olympique Lyonnais scored more goals away.\n\nWait, but looking at row 4's data:\n- In the first round (which I assume is the first leg), it was 0-0.\n- The second round (second leg) was 4-4.\n\nSo let me think about which team was playing at home in each leg. Usually, the first leg might have one team at home and the second leg the other, but looking at row 4:\n\nTeam 1 is FC Nantes (D1), Team 2 is Olympique Lyonnais (D2). The first round score is 0-0, which could mean that in the first leg, maybe FC Nantes was at home? Then the second leg would have been Olympique Lyonnais at home.\n\nSo in the first leg: FC Nantes vs OL, it's 0-0. Then the second leg: OL vs FC Nantes, it's 4-4.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because if the away goals are considered, let me see which team scored more away goals.\n\nIn the first leg (assuming Team1 is home): FC Nantes at home vs OL away. The score was 0-0, so no goals in either direction.\n\nIn the second leg, OL is home against FC Nantes away. The score was 4-4. So OL scored 4 at home, and FC Nantes also scored 4, but since they were away, their 4 would be considered as away goals.\n\nWait, no: in the second leg, OL is home, so FC Nantes are the away team. They scored 4 goals away (since it's 4-4 in that match). But in aggregate, each has 4 goals.\n\nSo total away goals:\n- For FC Nantes, their away goal would be from the second leg: they were away and scored 4.\n- Olympique Lyonnais were home in the second leg, so any goals they scored there are home goals. Their only other game was the first leg where they were away, but that was 0-0.\n\nSo total away goals for FC Nantes: 4 (from second leg).\nTotal away goals for OL: 0 (since their away game in the first leg had no goals).\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The claim says \"require the match to be decided by the away goal rule.\" So if the aggregate is tied at 4-4, then we look at away goals.\n\nIn this case:\n- FC Nantes have 4 away goals (from second leg)\n- OL has 0 away goals (since their only away game was first leg, which was 0-0)\n\nSo according to the away goal rule, FC Nantes would win because they scored more away goals. However, the claim doesn't specify who won but just that it required the away goal rule.\n\nWait, but in row 4's data, the total score is already 4-4. So does that mean they had to go into extra time or use the away goal? But in reality, the away goal is only used when aggregate scores are equal after both legs. Since here, it's a tie at 4-4, then yes, the away goal rule would apply.\n\nBut wait, in this row, the total score is already 4-4, but each leg was 0-0 and 4-4. So how does that work? Because if you add up both legs, it's 0+4 =4 for FC Nantes, and 0+4=4 for OL.\n\nSo yes, their aggregate scores are tied at 4-4, so they would need to use the away goal rule to decide who wins. Since FC Nantes scored more goals in the away leg (they were away in the second leg where they scored 4), so FC Nantes have 4 away goals versus OL's 0.\n\nThus, according to the away goal rule, FC Nantes would be declared the winner.\n\nBut wait, looking back at row 4, the score is \"4 - 4\", which I think refers to the aggregate. Because in some systems, the overall match result is shown as the total after both legs. So perhaps this data isn't showing individual leg scores but just the total.\n\nWait no, let me look again:\n\nRow 4: \n\"fc nantes (d1)\" vs \"olympique lyonnais (d2)\"\nscore: \"4 - 4\"\n1st round: \"0 - 0\"\n2nd round: \"4 - 4\"\n\nSo in this case, the overall aggregate is 4-4 because each leg had a score, so first leg was 0-0 and second leg was 4-4. So indeed, aggregate is tied.\n\nTherefore, the away goal rule would apply, as per football rules. But in this data, it's not shown who actually won; it just shows that the overall result was a tie at 4-4, necessitating the use of the away goal rule to determine the winner.\n\nSo the claim is correct in saying that because their aggregate scores were tied, they had to apply the away goal rule. Therefore, row index 4 is the one where this situation occurs.\n\nWait but according to the data provided, in the second leg, it's a 4-4 draw as well, which might imply that even after two legs, the score was still tied, so they needed to use the away goal rule. However, in reality, sometimes if the aggregate is tied at the end of both legs, they go into extra time or penalties, but I think the away goal rule is an older tiebreaker.\n\nBut regardless, according to the data given, row 4 has a total score of 4-4 and each leg's scores. So this would be the match where the away goal rule comes into play because their aggregate was tied.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be row index 4.\n</think>\n\nThe task is to identify which row in the data corresponds to a situation where two teams have the same aggregate score after two legs of a match, necessitating the use of the away goal rule. The key steps are:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant row**: Row 4 involves FC Nantes (D1) and Olympique Lyonnais (D2).\n2. **Analyze the scores**:\n   - First leg: 0-0 draw.\n   - Second leg: 4-4 draw, leading to an aggregate of 4-4.\n3. **Apply the away goal rule**: Since the aggregate is tied at 4-4, the team with more away goals wins. FC Nantes scored 4 away goals in the second leg, while Olympique Lyonnais had no away goals from their first leg.\n\nThus, row index 4 is where the away goal rule applies.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{4}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim says.\n\nThe claim is: \"In the first leg, only 1 goal was scored by an away team: fc mulhouse scored 1 against girondin de bordeaux.\"\n\nSo, breaking it down:\n- The focus is on the first leg (which I think refers to the '1st round' column in the table).\n- It mentions that only one goal was scored by an away team during this round.\n- Specifically, fc mulhouse scored 1 against girondin de bordeaux.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which rows involve an away team scoring goals. Let's go through each row:\n\nLooking at each data row in the table:\n1. RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg: The score is 1 - 0. Looking at '1st round' it's also 1-0. So, team1 (RC Lens) scored 1, team2 didn't score. Since team2 is away here, no goals scored by the away team in this match.\n2. FC Rouen vs Stade Lavallois: The overall score is 2 -4. In the first round, it's 1-0. So again, team1 (FC Rouen) scores 1, team2 doesn't. Team2 is away here as well, so no goals from them.\n3. AS Monaco vs AS Nancy: Overall 6-1. First round, 2-0. Team1 (AS Monaco) scored both in the first round, team2 didn't. So again, no away goals here.\n4. Girondins de Bordeaux vs FC Mulhouse: The overall score is 2-3. In the first round, it's 0-1. Here, team2 (FC Mulhouse) is the away team and scored 1 goal in the first leg. This matches the claim.\n5. FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais: Overall 4-4. First round, 0-0. So no goals from either team in the first leg here.\n6. AS Cannes vs FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard: Overall 4-1. First round, 3-0. Team1 (AS Cannes) scored all three, so away team didn't score.\n7. Sporting Toulon Var vs En Avant Guingamp: Overall 2-1. First round, 2-0. So team1 scored both in the first leg; away team didn't contribute here.\n8. FC Metz vs Besan\u00e7on RC: Overall 5-1. First round, 4-0. Team1 (FC Metz) scored all four in the first leg; away team didn't score.\n\nNow, from this analysis, only in row index 3 did the away team (FC Mulhouse) score a goal in the first leg. They scored exactly 1 goal against Girondins de Bordeaux. \n\nThe claim says that \"only 1 goal was scored by an away team\" in the first leg. From the data, this seems to be correct because only FC Mulhouse scored 1 goal as an away team in their match.\n\nSo, checking each condition:\n- The first leg refers to the '1st round' column: Correct.\n- Only one away team scored a goal in total across all matches: Yes, just FC Mulhouse with 1 goal.\n- The specific mention of fc mulhouse scoring 1 against girondin de bordeaux is accurate.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are from row index 3 where 'team 2' is FC Mulhouse and the '1st round' score shows they scored 1 goal as the away team.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 3,\n       \"column_name\": \"team 2\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 3,\n       \"column_name\": \"1st round\"\n     }\n   ]\n}",

The claim states: \"the highest scoring leg, and highest aggregate score for a match, total 8 goal, with fc nantes vs olympique lyonnais.\" Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let me understand the table structure. The columns are \"team 1\", \"score\", \"team 2\", \"1st round\", and \"2nd round\". Each row represents a match between two teams, showing their scores in each round and the overall aggregate.\n\nThe claim mentions three things: highest scoring leg, highest aggregate score (totaling 8 goals), and that it's between FC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnais. I need to check if all these are accurate according to the table.\n\nLooking at each match:\n\n1. RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg: The scores are \"1 - 0\" overall. Each round also sums up to low numbers.\n2. FC Rouen vs Stade Lavallois: Overall score is \"2 - 4\", so total goals here are 6.\n3. AS Monaco vs AS Nancy: The overall score is \"6 - 1\", making the aggregate 7 goals.\n4. Girondins de Bordeaux vs FC Mulhouse: Scores add up to a lower number, not relevant here.\n5. FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais: Their overall score is \"4 - 4\", totaling 8 goals. Both legs are \"0-0\" and \"4-4\", so the aggregate is indeed 8.\n6. AS Cannes vs FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard: The aggregate is lower, around 5 goals.\n7. Sporting Toulon Var vs En Avant Guingamp: Aggregate is 3 goals, not relevant.\n\nNow, checking if this is the highest scoring leg and aggregate. Looking at all matches, the maximum aggregate is 8 goals here. The legs are \"0-0\" in the first round and \"4-4\" in the second, so the second leg has a high score of 8, which might be considered the highest scoring leg.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm if any other match has higher per-leg scores. For example, AS Monaco vs AS Nancy: their overall is 7 goals, with legs \"2-0\" and \"4-1\". The first leg was lower, so the second leg had 5 goals. So in terms of single-leg scoring, the second leg between FC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnais has 8 goals, which is higher than any other leg.\n\nTherefore, the claim that this match has the highest aggregate (8) and the highest scoring leg (second round with 4-4, totaling 8) seems correct. The teams involved are indeed FC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnais as per row index 4.\n\nSo, all conditions in the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the match between FC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnais has an aggregate score of 8 goals, which is the highest.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"as monaco score the few goal in the round of 16 in the 1983 - 84 coupe de france\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying and then check against the data.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"AS Monaco\" scoring the fewest goals in the Round of 16 during the 1983-84 Coupe de France. So I need to look at the data for AS Monaco and see how many goals they scored in that round.\n\nLooking at the table structure: The columns are \"team 1\", \"score\", \"team 2\", \"1st round\", and \"2nd round\". Each row represents a match between two teams, with their scores in each of the rounds mentioned.\n\nI'll go through each row to find where AS Monaco is involved. Scanning the rows:\n\n- Row 0: RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg. Not Monaco.\n- Row 1: FC Rouen vs Stade Lavallois. No Monaco here either.\n- Row 2: AS Monaco (d1) vs AS Nancy (d1). Okay, this is the row with AS Monaco.\n\nIn this row, under \"score\", it's \"6 - 1\". That means AS Monaco scored 6 goals and AS Nancy scored 1 in the match. The next columns are \"1st round\" and \"2nd round\". For this row:\n\n- 1st round: \"2 - 0\" (Monaco scored 2)\n- 2nd round: \"4 - 1\" (Monaco scored 4)\n\nWait, but the claim is about the Round of 16. The columns mention \"1st round\" and \"2nd round\". So I need to clarify what these rounds correspond to. Typically in a knockout tournament like Coupe de France, each stage reduces the number of teams by half. So the first round might be earlier stages, perhaps before the Round of 16.\n\nBut looking at the table, it's not explicitly stated whether \"1st round\" refers to the group stages or specific knockout rounds. However, since the claim is about the Round of 16 in the Coupe de France, I should focus on that specific stage.\n\nThe row for AS Monaco shows a score of 6-1 overall, with 2 goals in the first round and 4 in the second. If we're talking about the Round of 16 being one of these rounds, then perhaps their goal count is either 2 or 4. But without more context on which specific column corresponds to the Round of 16, it's a bit unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"score\" refers to the total goals in that particular match. So if AS Monaco played against AS Nancy and scored 6 goals in that encounter, perhaps the Round of 16 is this particular game. But 6 goals isn't few; it's actually quite high. The claim says they scored the fewest goals, so this seems contradictory.\n\nLooking at other teams to see their scores:\n\n- RC Lens (row 0): Scored 1 in the first round and 0 in the second.\n- FC Rouen (row 1): Scored 2 in the first, 1 in the second. Total 3.\n- Girondins de Bordeaux (row 3): 2 goals in total.\n- FC Nantes (row 4): 4 goals.\n- AS Cannes (row 5): 4 goals.\n- Sporting Toulon Var (row 6): 2 goals.\n- FC Metz (row 7): 5 goals.\n\nComparing all the teams, AS Monaco scored the highest with 6 goals. So if the claim is that they scored the fewest, this would be false. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure of the table. Perhaps each row represents a different round. For example, in the first row, RC Lens vs Strasbourg in the 1st and 2nd rounds.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"score\" column is the aggregate score for that particular match (e.g., two legs), with the 1st and 2nd round being each leg's result. So AS Monaco scored 2 goals in the first leg and 4 in the second, totaling 6. If the Round of 16 refers to a single game, perhaps one of these legs.\n\nBut regardless, if AS Monaco is the top scorer with 6 goals in their match, they didn't score the fewest. The team scoring the least would be RC Lens (1 goal) or FC Rouen (2). So the claim that AS Monaco scored the fewest in the Round of 16 is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cells are the row where AS Monaco is mentioned and their scores.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2nd round\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's see. I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"fc nantes and fc mulhouse tie on aggregate with a score of 4-4, require the match to be decided by the away goal rule.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part means. On aggregate usually refers to both legs of a two-legged competition (like in some cup tournaments) combined. So, each team plays home and away, and their scores are added together.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there's data for \"1st round\" and \"2nd round.\" Wait, but actually, the columns are \"team 1\", \"score\", \"team 2\", \"1st round\", and \"2nd round.\" So each row seems to represent a single match between two teams. The \"1st round\" and \"2nd round\" might refer to the two legs of their competition.\n\nSo for the claim, it's about fc nantes and fc mulhouse tying 4-4 on aggregate. That would mean that across both rounds (home and away), each team scored a total of four goals.\n\nLet me check the rows for these teams. \n\nLooking at row index 3: \"girondins de bordeaux (d1)\" vs \"fc mulhouse (d2)\". The score is 2-3 overall, with 0-1 in the first round and 2-2 in the second. So that's not fc nantes.\n\nThen row index 4: \"fc nantes (d1)\" vs \"olympique lyonnais (d2)\". The total score is 4-4. Let me check the rounds: first round 0-0, second round 4-4. Wait, but that's against olympique lyonnais, not fc mulhouse.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. So, does each team play multiple matches? Or are these all separate matches?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is about two separate matches involving these teams. Let me check if both teams appear in different rows and their aggregate scores sum up to 4-4.\n\nBut according to the table, each row represents a single match between two specific teams. So fc nantes is only mentioned once (row 4) against olympique lyonnais, with a total score of 4-4. Similarly, fc mulhouse is in row 3, playing against girondins de bordeaux.\n\nSo, the claim mentions that fc nantes and fc mulhouse tied 4-4 on aggregate. But according to the table, they didn't play each other; instead, each played a different opponent with their own scores. Therefore, there's no direct head-to-head between them in the table.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting \"aggregate.\" Could it mean that each team has individual aggregates across all their matches? That doesn't seem right because the claim specifically mentions two teams tying against each other.\n\nAnother possibility is that the rounds are legs of a single competition. So, for example, if fc nantes played fc mulhouse in both the first and second round (like home and away), but looking at the table, I don't see any rows where these two teams face each other in either round.\n\nSo based on the data given, there's no match between fc nantes and fc mulhouse. Therefore, the claim that they tied 4-4 on aggregate is not supported by the table. Hence, it should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"there be 2 scoreless legs - the second round of rc lens vs olympique lyonnais, and the first round of fc nantes vs rc strasbourg.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts to check each one.\n\nPart 1: Second round of rc lens vs olympique lyonnais. I'll look through the table to find where these teams played against each other. Scanning the \"team 1\" and \"team 2\" columns, I don't see rc lens playing against olympique lyonnais in any row. The first entry is rc lens vs rc strasbourg, and olympique lyonnais is paired with fc nantes. So this part might not be accurate.\n\nPart 2: First round of fc nantes vs rc strasbourg. Looking at the rows, I see that fc nantes (d1) played against olympique lyonnais (d2). Their first round score was \"0 - 0\", which is a scoreless leg. But rc strasbourg is in the first row as team 2, playing against rc lens. The first round there was \"1 - 0\", so that's not scoreless. \n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. In the data array, the first row has rc lens vs rc strasbourg with a first round of \"1 - 0\" and second round \"0 - 0\". So the first round was scored, but the second was 0-0. The fifth row is fc nantes vs olympique lyonnais with first round 0-0. \n\nSo the claim mentions two scoreless legs: one in the second round of rc lens vs olympique lyonnais (which doesn't exist) and another in the first round of fc nantes vs rc strasbourg (also not matching). The actual scoreless legs are in different matches, so the claim is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2nd round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what the claim says.\n\nThe claim mentions two things: \n1. The highest scoring leg with a total of 8 goals.\n2. The highest aggregate score for a match, also totaling 8 goals, between FC Nantes and Besan\u00e7on RC.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the table to check these claims.\n\nLooking at the \"score\" column, which shows the aggregate scores:\n- Row 0: rc lens vs rc strasbourg - 1-0 \u2192 total 1 goal.\n- Row 1: fc rouen vs stade lavallois - 2-4 \u2192 total 6 goals.\n- Row 2: as monaco vs as nancy - 6-1 \u2192 total 7 goals.\n- Row 3: girondins de bordeaux vs fc mulhouse - 2-3 \u2192 total 5 goals.\n- Row 4: fc nantes vs olympique lyonnais - 4-4 \u2192 total 8 goals.\n- Row 5: as cannes vs fc sochaux - 4-1 \u2192 total 5 goals.\n- Row 6: sporting toulon var vs en avant guingamp - 2-1 \u2192 total 3 goals.\n- Row 7: fc metz vs besan\u00e7on rc - 5-1 \u2192 total 6 goals.\n\nThe highest aggregate score is indeed 8 goals in row 4 (fc nantes vs olympique lyonnais). So the second part of the claim about the aggregate score being 8 is correct, but the teams mentioned are fc nantes vs besan\u00e7on rc. Wait, that's not right because row 7 has fc metz vs besan\u00e7on rc with a 5-1 score (6 goals total), which isn't 8.\n\nSo the claim incorrectly pairs fc nantes with besan\u00e7on rc for the aggregate of 8 goals. The actual match with 8 goals is between fc nantes and olympique lyonnais, not besan\u00e7on rc.\n\nNow checking the highest scoring leg, looking at both \"1st round\" and \"2nd round\":\n- Row 4's 1st round was 0-0 (0 goals) and 2nd round was 4-4 (8 goals). The legs themselves aren't higher than other matches. For example, row 2 has a 2-0 first leg and 4-1 second leg, but the aggregate is 7.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"highest scoring leg.\" Each leg's score should be considered. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 0: 1-0 (1st) and 0-0 (2nd). Total per leg: 1 and 0.\nRow 1: 1-0 (1st, total 1), 1-3 (2nd, total 4).\nRow 2: 2-0 (2 goals) and 4-1 (5 goals).\nRow 3: 0-1 (1 goal) and 2-2 (4 goals).\nRow 4: 0-0 (0) and 4-4 (8). So the second leg here is 8, which is higher than others.\nRow 5: 3-0 (3) and 1-1 (2).\nRow 6: 2-0 (2) and 0-1 (1).\nRow 7: 4-0 (4) and 1-1 (2).\n\nThe highest scoring leg is in row 4's second round with 8 goals. So the first part of the claim is correct about the highest scoring leg being 8 goals.\n\nHowever, the aggregate score for that match is also 8, but it's between fc nantes and olympique lyonnais, not besan\u00e7on rc. Therefore, the second part of the claim is incorrect because it attributes the aggregate to the wrong teams.\n\nSince both conditions aren't fully supported\u2014only the highest leg is correct, but the aggregate is misattributed\u2014the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "claim": "in the first leg , only 2 be score by an away team : fc mulhouse score 1 against girondin de bordeaux",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"in the first leg, only 2 be score by an away team: fc mulhouse score 1 against girondin de bordeaux.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this claim. It seems like it's saying that in the first round (or \"first leg\"), only two goals were scored by away teams, and specifically, FC Mulhouse scored one goal against Girondins de Bordeaux.\n\nLooking at the table structure: each row represents a match between Team 1 and Team 2. The columns are \"team 1\", \"score\", \"team 2\", \"1st round\", \"2nd round\". The \"1st round\" column shows the scores from the first leg, I believe.\n\nSo, for each match, I should look at the \"1st round\" score to determine how many goals were scored by away teams. \n\nI'll go through each row:\n\nRow 0: rc lens vs rc strasbourg. The 1st round is 1-0. So Team 2 (rc strasbourg) is away? Or does it depend on the setup? Wait, in football matches, usually, the first team listed is the home team. So in this case, rc lens would be home, and rc strasbourg is away. The score in the 1st round was 1-0 for Team 1 (rc lens), so no goals scored by the away team here.\n\nRow 1: fc rouen vs stade lavallois. 1st round is 1-0. Again, Team 1 (fc rouen) is home, scoring 1 goal. The away team (stade lavallois) didn't score in the first leg.\n\nRow 2: as monaco vs as nancy. 1st round is 2-0. So Team 1 (as monaco) scored both goals; no goals from the away team.\n\nRow 3: girondins de bordeaux vs fc mulhouse. The 1st round score is 0-1. Wait, that's interesting. The home team here would be girondins de bordeaux (Team 1), and Team 2 is fc mulhouse as the away team. So in the first leg, the score was 0 for Team 1 and 1 for Team 2. That means the away team scored once.\n\nRow 4: fc nantes vs olympique lyonnais. The 1st round is 0-0. No goals from either team in the first leg.\n\nRow 5: as cannes vs fc sochaux-montb\u00e9liard. The 1st round score is 3-0, which would be Team 1 (as cannes) scoring all three; away team didn't score here.\n\nRow 6: sporting toulon var vs en avant guingamp. The 1st round is 2-0. So Team 1 scored twice; away team didn't contribute any goals in the first leg.\n\nRow 7: fc metz vs besan\u00e7on rc. The 1st round score is 4-0, so Team 1 (fc metz) scored all four; no goals from the away team.\n\nSo looking through all these rows, the only instance where an away team scored in the first leg was Row 3: fc mulhouse scored 1 goal against girondins de bordeaux. \n\nWait, but the claim says \"only 2 be score by an away team.\" That would imply two goals from away teams across all matches in the first round. But according to my analysis, only one goal was scored by an away team (fc mulhouse) in their match.\n\nHmm, so that suggests the claim is incorrect because it's not just two goals but actually one goal. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: I need to identify all instances where an away team scored in the first leg. That only happens in Row 3 under \"1st round.\" So the relevant cell is row index 3 and column name \"1st round.\"\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check. Maybe I misread some rows.\n\nLooking again at each row's 1st round:\n\nRow 0: Team 2 (away) scored 0.\nRow 1: Team 2 (away) scored 0.\nRow 2: Team 2 (away) scored 0.\nRow 3: Team 2 (fc mulhouse) scored 1.\nRow 4: Both teams scored 0.\nRow 5: Team 2 scored 0.\nRow 6: Team 2 scored 0.\nRow 7: Team 2 scored 0.\n\nSo only Row 3 has an away team scoring in the first leg, with just one goal. Thus, the claim that \"only 2 be score by an away team\" is incorrect because it's actually just 1 goal. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that two goals were scored by away teams in the first leg, specifically mentioning FC Mulhouse scoring once against Girondins de Bordeaux. However, upon examining each match, only one goal was scored by an away team (FC Mulhouse) in their first leg. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
