    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"tevita vaikona score 100 point on 25 tries\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for Tevita Vaikona in the data. Scanning through the rows, I see that Tevita Vaikona is listed as a wing player. Now, checking his stats: tries are 25 and points are 100. \n\nThe claim says he scored 100 points from 25 tries. Wait a second, in rugby league, each try is worth 4 points, right? So if you score a try, that's 4 points. Also, if there's an additional conversion or extra point, that adds more. But in the table, the 'tries' column just shows how many times he got over the line.\n\nSo, doing the math: 25 tries x 4 points each would be 100 points. That matches exactly with his points total of 100 as per the table. There's no mention of goals or conversions in this case since the 'goals' column for him is 0. So all his points come from tries, which adds up correctly.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Tevita Vaikona scored 100 points on 25 tries seems to be accurate based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Tevita Vaikona scored 100 points from 25 tries. Checking the table:\n\n- Tevita Vaikona is in row 1 (index starts at 0).\n- He has 25 tries and 100 points.\n\nEach try equals 4 points, so 25 x 4 = 100 points, which matches his total points.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says: \"tevita vaikona be the only player to score at least 100 point when make more than 23 tries.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse this correctly. It seems like the claim has two conditions for a player:\n1. They scored at least 100 points.\n2. They made more than 23 tries.\n\nAnd the claim is that Tevita Vaikona is the only one who meets both these conditions.\n\nLooking at the table, I should check each player's \"points\" and \"tries\" columns to see if they meet both criteria.\n\nStarting with Tevita Vaikona. His row in the data is index 1. Let me look at his points: it says 100, which is exactly 100, so that meets the first condition. Now, his tries are 25, which is more than 23. So he does meet both conditions.\n\nNow I need to check all other players to see if any others also have at least 100 points and more than 23 tries.\n\nLet's go through each player:\n\n- Robbie Paul: points 92 (less than 100), so doesn't meet.\n- Tevita Vaikona: already checked, meets both.\n- Leon Pryce: points 64 <100.\n- Nathan Mcavoy: 16 points <100.\n- Michael Withers: points 124 (meets first condition). His tries are 31. So he has more than 23 tries and over 100 points. That means he also meets both conditions, which would make the claim false because there's another player besides Tevita Vaikona.\n\nWait, but let me double-check Michael Withers' data. Yes, his points are 124, which is above 100, and tries are 31, which is more than 23. So he qualifies as well.\n\nAre there any others? Let's see:\n\n- Henry Paul: points 457, that's way over 100. His tries are 9, which is less than or equal to 23 (since the condition is more than 23). So he doesn't meet both.\n- Paul Deacon: points 86 <100.\n- Joe Vagana: 8 points <100.\n- James Lowes: 53 <100.\n- Paul Anderson: 32 <100.\n- Daniel Gartner: 56 <100.\n- Mike Foshaw: 24 <100.\n- Lee Gilmour: 32 <100.\n- Shane Rigon: 48 <100.\n- Alex Wilkinson: 0 points.\n- Lee Radford: 8 <100.\n- Jamie Peacock: 32 <100.\n- Scott Naylor: 56 <100.\n- Brian McDermott: 12 <100.\n- Graham Mackay: 50 <100.\n- Paul Sykes: 0 points.\n- Rob Parker: 0 points.\n- Stuart Spruce: 24 <100.\n- Stuart Fielden: 12 <100.\n\nSo, apart from Tevita Vaikona and Michael Withers, no one else meets both conditions. Therefore, the claim that Tevita is the only player with at least 100 points and more than 23 tries is false because Michael also qualifies.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\nFor Tevita: row 1, columns \"points\" (92) and \"tries\" (25).\nWait, no, wait. Wait, in the initial data, let me check again:\n\nLooking back at the JSON data, the columns are [\"player\", \"position\", \"tries\", \"goals\", \"points\"].\n\nSo for Tevita Vaikona, row index 1: tries is 25 (more than 23) and points 100. So he meets both.\n\nMichael Withers is at row index 4: tries are 31, which is more than 23, and points 124. He also meets both conditions.\n\nSo the relevant cells should include both players' points and tries columns to show that Michael also qualifies.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Michael Withers also has over 100 points and more than 23 tries.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tries\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
