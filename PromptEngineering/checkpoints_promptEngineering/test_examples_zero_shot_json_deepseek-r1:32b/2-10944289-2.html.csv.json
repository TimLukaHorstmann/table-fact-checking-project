    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim about the Indianapolis Colts playing against the New York Giants on September 10 at Giant Stadium with a final score of 26-21 is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are \"date,\" \"visiting team,\" \"final score,\" \"host team,\" and \"stadium.\" So each row represents a game with these details.\n\nThe claim mentions four specific pieces of information:\n1. The date is September 10.\n2. The visiting team is the Indianapolis Colts.\n3. The host team is the New York Giants.\n4. The stadium where they played is Giant Stadium.\n5. The final score was 26-21, with the Colts scoring 26 and the Giants 21.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row in the data to find any entry that matches the date September 10. Looking at the \"date\" column:\n\nRow 0: september 7\nRow 1: september 10 \u2192 This matches our target date.\nRow 2: september 17\n... and so on.\n\nSo, I'll focus on row index 1 since that's where September 10 is listed. Now, let me check the details in this row:\n\n- Visiting team: indianapolis colts\n- Host team: new york giants\n- Stadium: giants stadium\n- Final score: 26 - 21\n\nComparing these to the claim:\n- The visiting team is indeed the Indianapolis Colts.\n- The host team is correctly listed as the New York Giants.\n- The stadium is Giant Stadium, which matches.\n- The final score of 26-21 is also accurate according to this row.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the data in row index 1. There's no discrepancy between the claim and what's provided in the table.\n\nI should make sure there are no other rows with September 10, but looking through the rest of the table, I don't see any duplicates for that date. So this is the only relevant entry to check against the claim.\n\nIn conclusion, since every aspect of the claim aligns perfectly with the information in row index 1 of the table, the claim must be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"visiting team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"host team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"final score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the dallas cowboys lose at texas stadium on december 10 to the new orleans saint.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the key elements of the claim:\n- **Team Involved**: Dallas Cowboys\n- **Location**: Texas Stadium\n- **Date**: December 10\n- **Opponent**: New Orleans Saints\n- **Outcome**: Loss by Dallas Cowboys\n\nI'll start by looking through each row in the table to find any entries that match these criteria.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n1. **Row 3**: September 24 - Denver Broncos vs New England Patriots.\n2. **Row 5**: October 8 - Pittsburgh Steelers vs San Diego Chargers.\n3. **Row 7**: November 5 - Indianapolis Colts vs New England Patriots.\n4. **Row 9**: November 12 - Chicago Bears vs New York Giants.\n5. **Row 10**: November 19 - San Diego Chargers vs Denver Broncos.\n6. **Row 11**: November 26 - Philadelphia Eagles vs Indianapolis Colts.\n7. **Row 12**: December 3 - Seattle Seahawks vs Denver Broncos.\n8. **Row 13**: December 10 - New Orleans Saints vs Dallas Cowboys at Texas Stadium.\n\nWait, row index might be off because the data starts from 0. Let me recount:\n\n- Row 0: September 7\n- Row 1: September 10\n- Row 2: September 17\n- Row 3: September 24\n- Row 4: October 1\n- Row 5: October 8\n- Row 6: October 15\n- Row 7: October 29\n- Row 8: November 5\n- Row 9: November 12\n- Row 10: November 19\n- Row 11: November 26\n- Row 12: December 3\n- Row 13: December 10 - Here we go.\n\nLooking at row index 13:\n- Date: December 10 \u2705\n- Visiting Team: New Orleans Saints \u2705\n- Host Team: Dallas Cowboys \u2705\n- Stadium: Texas Stadium \u2705\n\nNow, checking the final score: \"42  -  17\". That means New Orleans Saints scored 42 and Dallas Cowboys scored 17.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"on september 17 , the final score at texas stadium be 10 - 27\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. Date: September 17\n2. Stadium: Texas Stadium\n3. Final Score: 10-27\n\nI need to check each of these against the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the JSON structure, the columns are \"date\", \"visiting team\", \"final score\", \"host team\", and \"stadium\". The data is a list of rows where each row corresponds to a game with these details.\n\nI'll start by finding all rows where the date is September 17. Scanning through the dates:\n\n- Row 0: september 7\n- Row 1: september 10\n- Row 2: september 17 \u2192 This matches.\n- Rows beyond that have different months or days, so I can stop here.\n\nNow, focusing on row 2 (index 2 in zero-based indexing), let's extract the relevant columns:\n\n- Date: \"september 17\" \u2705\n- Stadium: \"texas stadium\" \u2705\n- Final Score: \"10  - 27\" \u2705\n\nSo all parts of the claim are satisfied by this row. The visiting team is Washington Redskins, and the host team is Dallas Cowboys. But since the claim doesn't mention teams, only date, stadium, and score, those three aspects match exactly.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are from row 2 for the columns \"date\", \"stadium\", and \"final score\".\n\nI think that's all I need to check. There are no other rows with September 17 or Texas Stadium on that date, so this must be the correct match.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because row 2 contains September 17, Texas Stadium, and a final score of 10-27.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"final score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"when the indianapolis colt be the visiting team at giant stadium, the final score be 26-21.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for entries where the visiting team is \"indianapolis colts\" and the stadium is \"giants stadium.\" \n\nLooking through each row:\n- Row 1: The visiting team is \"indianapolis colts,\" but the stadium here is \"giants stadium.\" Let me check the date, which is September 10. The final score in this row is 26 - 21, with the visiting team scoring 26 and the host team (New York Giants) scoring 21.\n\nWait a minute, that seems to match exactly what the claim is saying. So according to this data, when Indianapolis Colts visited Giants Stadium on September 10, they won with a score of 26-21 against the New York Giants. \n\nBut wait, the claim says \"the final score be 26 - 21.\" However, in the table, it's written as \"26  -  21,\" which might represent visiting team vs host team or vice versa. Since the visiting team is Indianapolis Colts and the score is listed as \"visiting team\" first? Or is it always \"host team\" first?\n\nWait, looking at another row: For example, in row 0, the visiting team is Miami Dolphins with a score of 17-28 against Pittsburgh Steelers. So, that's 17 (Miami) - 28 (Pittsburgh). So, yes, the format is visiting team score first.\n\nSo in row 1, visiting team Indianapolis Colts scored 26, host team New York Giants scored 21. So the final score is 26-21 with Colts winning as visitors at Giants Stadium.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there's a match where Indianapolis Colts were the visiting team at Giants Stadium and the final score was 26-21 in their favor.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because row 1 shows the Indianapolis Colts as the visiting team at Giants Stadium with a final score of 26-21.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"visiting team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"final score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether a given claim about a sports table (provided in JSON format) is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully:\n\n\"the denver bronco and the chicago bear play at the rca dome, end in the broncos' favor with a score of 23 - 8\"\n\nBreaking down the claim into parts:\n1. The teams involved are Denver Broncos (referred to as \"bronco\") and Chicago Bears.\n2. The game took place at the RCA Dome.\n3. The result was in favor of the Broncos with a final score of 23-8.\n\nNow, I need to verify each part against the data provided in the JSON table.\n\nLet's look through each row in the \"data\" array:\n\nLooking for rows where either \"visiting team\" or \"host team\" includes Denver Broncos and Chicago Bears, and the stadium is RCA Dome.\n\nGoing through each entry:\n- Row 0: Miami Dolphins vs Pittsburgh Steelers at Heinz Field. Not relevant.\n- Row 1: Indianapolis Colts vs New York Giants at Giants Stadium. No.\n- Row 2: Washington Redskins vs Dallas Cowboys at Texas Stadium. No.\n- Row 3: Denver Broncos (visiting) vs New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium. The stadium isn't RCA Dome, so not a match.\n- Row 4: Seattle Seahawks vs Chicago Bears at Soldier Field. No.\n- Row 5: Pittsburgh Steelers vs San Diego Chargers at Qualcomm Stadium. No.\n- Row 6: Oakland Raiders vs Denver Broncos at Invesco Field at Mile High. No.\n- Row 7: Dallas Cowboys vs Carolina Panthers at Bank of America Stadium. No.\n- Row 8: Indianapolis Colts (visiting) vs New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium. No.\n- Row 9: Chicago Bears (visiting) vs New York Giants at Giants Stadium. No.\n- Row 10: San Diego Chargers vs Denver Broncos at Invesco Field at Mile High. Not the right stadium.\n- Row 11: Philadelphia Eagles vs Indianapolis Colts at RCA Dome. So here, the stadium is correct (RCA Dome), but the teams are Eagles and Colts, not Broncos and Bears.\n- Row 12: Seattle Seahawks vs Denver Broncos at Invesco Field. No.\n- Row 13: New Orleans Saints vs Dallas Cowboys at Texas Stadium. No.\n- Row 14: Kansas City Chiefs vs San Diego Chargers at Qualcomm Stadium. No.\n- Row 15: Philadelphia Eagles (visiting) vs Dallas Cowboys at Texas Stadium. No.\n- Row 16: Green Bay Packers vs Chicago Bears at Soldier Field. Not the right stadium and teams aren't both Broncos and Bears.\n- Row 17: Kansas City Chiefs vs Indianapolis Colts at RCA Dome. Again, same as row 11; the teams are not Broncos and Bears.\n\nWait a second, looking back, in row 11 and row 17, the stadium is RCA Dome, but the teams involved aren't both Denver Broncos and Chicago Bears. Instead, they involve Philadelphia Eagles, Indianapolis Colts, or Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nIs there any entry where both Denver Broncos and Chicago Bears are playing at RCA Dome?\n\nLooking again through all rows:\n\n- No row has both Denver Broncos and Chicago Bears as opponents.\n- The only entries involving Denver Broncos are in rows 3,6,10,12. None of these have Chicago Bears as the opposing team.\n- Similarly, Chicago Bears appear in rows 4,9,16, etc., but not paired with Denver Broncos at RCA Dome.\n\nTherefore, there is no row where Denver Broncos and Chicago Bears play each other at RCA Dome.\n\nAdditionally, checking the scores: The claim mentions a score of 23-8. Let's see if any game at RCA Dome had such a score.\n\nIn row 11: Philadelphia Eagles (visiting) vs Indianapolis Colts (host) with a score of 23-8? Looking at the data:\n\nRow 11 has visiting team as \"Philadelphia Eagles\" and host as \"Indianapolis Colts\". The score isn't provided in the table, but even if it were, the teams aren't Denver Broncos and Chicago Bears.\n\nSimilarly, row 17: Kansas City Chiefs (visiting) vs Indianapolis Colts (host). Again, no.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- There's no game at RCA Dome between Denver Broncos and Chicago Bears in the provided data.\n- The score mentioned doesn't match any game at that stadium with these teams.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. But I need to identify which cells are relevant to verify this.\n\nRelevant checks would be:\n1. Looking for rows where the stadium is \"RCA Dome\" (column_name: \"stadium\").\n2. Checking if both teams involved are Denver Broncos and Chicago Bears in those rows (visiting team and host team columns).\n3. Verifying the score in those rows.\n\nSo, I'll look through all rows to find where \"stadium\" is \"RCA Dome\". From the data, that's row 11 and row 17.\n\nFor each of these:\n- Row 11: visiting team = \"Philadelphia Eagles\", host team = \"Indianapolis Colts\"\n- Row 17: visiting team = \"Kansas City Chiefs\", host team = \"Indianapolis Colts\"\n\nNeither of these matches Denver Broncos vs Chicago Bears. Therefore, the relevant cells are:\n\nFor row 11:\n- stadium\n- visiting team\n- host team\n\nSame for row 17.\n\nAdditionally, to confirm that no other rows have both teams and the correct stadium, we might check all rows where either team is Denver Broncos or Chicago Bears and see if any match.\n\nBut since there's no such row, the answer remains FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Denver Broncos and Chicago Bears played at RCA Dome with a score of 23-8 in favor of the Broncos. Checking the table:\n\n1. **Stadium Check**: Only rows 11 and 17 mention RCA Dome. These involve Philadelphia Eagles vs. Indianapolis Colts (row 11) and Kansas City Chiefs vs. Indianapolis Colts (row 17), not Denver or Chicago.\n\n2. **Teams Check**: No row lists both Denver Broncos and Chicago Bears as opponents at RCA Dome.\n\n3. **Score Check**: Even if the teams were correct, neither of these games had a score of 23-8 as per the provided data.\n\nThus, the claim is unsupported by the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"visiting team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"host team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"visiting team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"host team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So, there are three pieces of information here: the date (september 17), the stadium (soldier field), and the final score (10-27).\n\nNext, I'll look through the table data to find a row that matches both the date and the stadium. The table has multiple rows, so I'll go through each one.\n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n- Row 0: Date is september 7, stadium is heinz field.

Wait no, the initial table shows 19 data rows under \"data\" key.\n\nWait in the provided JSON, the data is under \"data\": [ ... ] with 19 elements (indices 0 to 18).\n\nLooking at each row's date and teams:\n\nRow 7: November 26, Eagles vs Colts\nRow 8: November 5, Colts vs Patriots\nRow 9: November 12, Bears vs Giants\nRow 10: November 19, Chargers vs Broncos\nRow 11: November 26, Eagles vs Colts? Wait no, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait the data is under \"data\": [ ... ] which includes all the games. Let me count:\n\nRow indices from 0 to 18 (since there are 19 rows). Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: September 7, Dolphins vs Steelers at undefined\nRow 1: September 10, Colts vs Giants at undefined\nRow 2: November 5, Colts vs Patriots at Gillette Stadium\nWait no, the initial data seems to have columns: date, visiting team, host team, stadium.\n\nWait looking back:\n\nIn the table structure provided in the JSON, each row has \"date\", \"visiting_team\", \"host_team\", and \"stadium\".\n\nSo for example, row 0 is September 7, Dolphins visit Steelers at undefined stadium. Row 1: September 10, Colts vs Giants.\n\nWait no, looking more carefully:\n\nThe data in the table includes rows with four elements each, corresponding to the columns date, visiting_team, host_team, stadium.\n\nSo for example:\n\nRow 0:\ndate: \"September 7\"\nvisiting_team: \"Miami Dolphins\"\nhost_team: \"Pittsburgh Steelers\"\nstadium: \"undefined\"\n\nSimilarly, row 13 is December 10, Saints vs Cowboys at Texas Stadium.\n\nWait I think I'm getting confused. Let me make a list:\n\nRow index | Date | Visiting Team | Host Team | Stadium\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\n0 | September 7 | Miami Dolphins | Pittsburgh Steelers | undefined\n1 | September 10 | Indianapolis Colts | New York Giants | undefined\n2 | November 5 | Indianapolis Colts | New England Patriots | Gillette Stadium\n3 | October 8 | Cleveland Browns | Kansas City Chiefs | Arrowhead Stadium\n4 | October 15 | Buffalo Bills | Cincinnati Bengals | Paul Brown Stadium\n5 | October 22 | Miami Dolphins | New York Jets | MetLife Stadium\n6 | October 29 | Houston Texans | Baltimore Ravens | M&T Bank Stadium\n7 | November 2 | Cleveland Browns | Pittsburgh Steelers | Heinz Field\n8 | November 5 | Indianapolis Colts | New England Patriots | Gillette Stadium (duplicate? Wait no, same as row 2)\nWait perhaps the initial data has duplicates or I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe rows are not in order. Let me instead look for any row where date is December 31 and teams are Cowboys vs Seahawks.\n\nLooking through each row's date:\n\nRow 0: September 7\nRow 1: September 10\nRow 2: November 5\nRow 3: October 8\nRow 4: October 15\nRow 5: October 22\nRow 6: October 29\nRow 7: November 2\nRow 8: November 5 (duplicate)\nRow 9: November 12\nRow 10: November 19\nRow 11: November 26\nRow 12: December 3\nRow 13: December 10\nRow 14: December 17\nRow 15: December 25\nRow 16: December 31 (this is the row we're interested in)\nRow 17: January 1\nRow 18: January 6\n\nSo row 16 has date December 31.\n\nCheck visiting team and host team:\n\nRow 16:\nvisiting_team: \"Green Bay Packers\"\nhost_team: \"Chicago Bears\"\nstadium: \"Soldier Field\"\n\nWait that's not Cowboys vs Seahawks. So no game on Dec 31 between those teams.\n\nLooking for any row with date December 31 where visiting or host team is Cowboys or Seahawks:\n\nNo such row exists in the provided data.\n\nTherefore, the claim that there was a game on December 31 between Cowboys and Seahawks at AT&T Stadium is incorrect because:\n\n- There's no such entry in the data.\n- The closest is row 16: Packers vs Bears on Dec 31 at Soldier Field.\n\nAdditionally, even if such a game existed, the stadium would not be AT&T Stadium (which is where Cowboys play) unless it was a neutral site or something, but according to the data, no such game exists.\n\nTherefore, the user's statement is incorrect based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe user's claim that there was a Dallas Cowboys vs. Seattle Seahawks game at AT&T Stadium on December 31th is incorrect based on the provided data. There is no entry for such a game on that date in the given table.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nNo, according to the schedule provided, the Dallas Cowboys did not play against the Seattle Seahawks at AT&T Stadium on December 31st. The closest entry is a game between the Green Bay Packers and the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field on that date. Therefore, the information stated in your query is incorrect based on the data given.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Incorrect}}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table in JSON format. The claim is: \"the final ables for the game at giant stadium when chicago bear be the visit team be 26  - 21\". Hmm, wait a second, \"final ables\" might be a typo. I think they meant \"final scores\". So, the claim is probably about the final score of a game where Chicago Bears were the visiting team at Giants Stadium.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the data array to find games that match these conditions: the stadium is \"giants stadium\" and the visiting team is \"chicago bears\". \n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 0: Heinz Field. Not relevant.\nRow 1: September 10, visiting team is Indianapolis Colts, host is NY Giants. Stadium is Giants Stadium. But visiting team isn't Chicago Bears. So not this one.\nRow 2: Texas Stadium. Different.\nRow 3: Gillette Stadium. No.\nRow 4: Soldier Field. Not relevant.\nRow 5: Qualcomm Stadium. No.\nRow 6: Invesco Field. No.\nRow 7: Bank of America Stadium. No.\nRow 8: Gillette Stadium again, visiting team is Colts, host Patriots. Doesn't fit.\nRow 9: November 12. Visiting team is Chicago Bears, host is NY Giants, stadium is Giants Stadium. So this row matches the conditions.\n\nNow, check the final score for that game. The final score column shows \"38  - 20\". Wait, but in the claim, it's supposed to be \"26  - 21\". That doesn't match. \n\nWait a minute, let me make sure I'm not missing another row where Chicago Bears are visiting Giants Stadium. Let me check all rows again.\n\nLooking through the rest:\n\nRow 10: Invesco Field, visiting Chargers vs Broncos. No.\nRow 11: RCA Dome. Not relevant.\nRow 12: December 3, visiting Seahawks, host Broncos. No.\nRow 13: Texas Stadium, Saints vs Cowboys. No.\nRow 14: Qualcomm Stadium again. No.\nRow 15: Soldier Field, Eagles vs Bears. Wait, no, row 15 is December 25, Philadelphia Eagles (visiting) and Chicago Bears as the host? Or is it the other way around? Let me check:\n\nWait no, in the table, each data entry has visiting team first, then host team. So row 15: Visiting team is Philadelphia Eagles, host is Dallas Cowboys at Texas Stadium. Wait, I think I confused that earlier.\n\nWait, let me correct myself. Each row's structure is [date, visiting team, final score, host team, stadium]. So in row 9 (index starting from 0?), no. Let me clarify the indexes because JSON arrays are zero-indexed.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow indices go from 0 to 17, I think. Wait, let's count:\n\nThe data array has 18 elements (from index 0 to 17). So row 9 is November 12: visiting team is Chicago Bears, host is NY Giants at Giants Stadium. Final score is \"38  - 20\".\n\nSo the claim says when Chicago Bears are the visiting team at Giants Stadium, the final score was 26-21. But according to this row, it's 38-20. So that doesn't match.\n\nWait, is there another game where Chicago Bears were the visitors at Giants Stadium? Let me check all rows again:\n\nRow 1: September 10 - Colts vs Giants at Giants Stadium. Visiting team is Colts.\nRow 9: November 12 - Bears vs Giants at Giants Stadium. That's the only one.\n\nSo in that game, the score was 38-20, not 26-21 as claimed. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because the final score doesn't match. The relevant cell is row index 9, column \"final score\".\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other rows where Chicago Bears are visiting Giants Stadium.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 4: Soldier Field, host is Bears, visiting is Eagles? No, row 4 is November 2, visiting team is Bears. Host is Eagles at Soldier Field. So that's a different stadium.\n\nSo only row 9 matches both conditions: visiting team is Chicago Bears and stadium is Giants Stadium. The final score in that case was 38-20, which contradicts the claim of 26-21.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a game where the Chicago Bears were the visiting team at Giants Stadium with a final score of 26-21. Checking the table, the only such game (row index 9) shows the final score as 38-20, not 26-21.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Conditions:** The claim specifies two conditions:\n   - The game was played at Giants Stadium.\n   - The visiting team was the Chicago Bears.\n   - The final score was 26-21.\n\n2. **Search Relevant Rows:**\n   - Look through each row for \"giants stadium\" in the 'stadium' column and check if the 'visiting team' is \"chicago bears\".\n\n3. **Find Matching Row:**\n   - Found at row index 9: date November 12, visiting team Chicago Bears, host New York Giants, stadium Giants Stadium.\n\n4. **Check Final Score:**\n   - The final score in this row is listed as \"38  - 20\", which does not match the claimed \"26  - 21\".\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since the final score does not align with the claim, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"final score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
