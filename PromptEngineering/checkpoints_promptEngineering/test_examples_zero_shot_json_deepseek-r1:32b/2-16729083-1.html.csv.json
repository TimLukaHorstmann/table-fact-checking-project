    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"at kansas city chief be the opponent in week 14 with an attendance of 74524.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim to check each part against the data.\n\nThe claim mentions three things:\n1. Opponent is \"kansas city chiefs\" in week 14.\n2. The attendance for that game was 74,524.\n\nI need to find the row corresponding to week 14 and verify both the opponent and the attendance.\n\nLooking at the table data:\n\nThe weeks go from 1 to 17, so I'll look for week 14. Scanning through each row until I find week 14.\n\nRow index 13 (since rows start at 0) has week 14. The opponent listed is \"kansas city chiefs,\" which matches the claim.\n\nNext, checking the attendance for that row: it's 77778. But the claim states 74524, which doesn't match.\n\nWait a second, did I look correctly? Let me double-check. Week 14 is at index 13. The attendance there is indeed 77778, not 74524 as claimed.\n\nHmm, maybe the claim refers to another week where the opponent was Kansas City Chiefs? Looking through other weeks:\n\nWeek 4: Opponent is \"kansas city chiefs,\" attendance 75037.\nWeek 14: Same opponent, attendance 77778.\nThere's also a later game against them in week 16 with attendance 75582.\n\nNone of these match 74524. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look again. Maybe another row where the attendance is 74524? Checking all rows:\n\nRow index 12 has attendance 74524, which is week 13 against \"seattle seahawks.\" So that's different opponents.\n\nTherefore, the claim incorrectly states the opponent as \"kansas city chiefs\" for week 14 and also misstates the attendance. Since both parts don't match, the claim should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly identifies the opponent in week 14 as Kansas City Chiefs with an incorrect attendance figure. The correct data shows a different attendance and opponent.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
