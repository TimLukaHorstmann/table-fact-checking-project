    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the record be 4 - 4 when the attendance at the game be 14489\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that there was a game where the team's record became 4-4, and during that game, the attendance was 14,489 people.\n\nLooking at the table, I should check each row to see if any entry has an attendance of 14,489 and whether the record in that same row is 4-4.\n\nLet me go through each data row one by one:\n\nRow 0: Attendance is 21597, record is 1-0. Doesn't match.\nRow 1: Attendance 15229, record 2-0. No.\nRow 2: Attendance 20462, record 2-1. No.\nRow 3: Attendance 18372, record 3-1. No.\nRow 4: Attendance 19141, record 3-2. No.\nRow 5: Attendance 12683, record 4-2. Close to the record but not 4-4.\nRow 6: Attendance 13002, record 4-3. Still not matching.\nRow 7: Attendance 14489 here. Let me check the record in this row. The record is listed as \"4 - 4\". Yes, that's exactly what the claim states.\n\nSo, in row index 7 (assuming rows start at 0), the attendance is 14489 and the record is 4-4. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells: I need to list the columns where these values are found. The record is under the \"record\" column, and attendance is under \"attendance\". Both are in row index 7.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by row 7 where both conditions (record 4-4 and attendance 14489) are met.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"november 6  , 1980 be the only record of a tied game that year\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions November 6, 1980, as being the only record of a tied game in that year. However, looking at the table's data, all the dates are from 1960. The earliest date is September 9, 1960, and the latest is December 10, 1960. So right away, I notice that the claim refers to 1980, which isn't even present in the table. All entries are from 1960.\n\nBut maybe there's a typo? The user might have meant November 6, 1960 instead of 1980. Let me check if there's an entry for November 6, 1960. Scanning through the data:\n\n- Week 9 is November 6, 1960, against the Houston Oilers with a result \"l 25 - 45\" and record \"4 - 4\". The result indicates a loss, not a tie.\n\nWait, looking further down the table:\n\n- Week 12: November 27, 1960; opponent Buffalo Bills; result \"t 38 - 38\", which is a tie. So that's one tied game in 1960.\n- Week 13: December 4, 1960; opponent New York Titans; result \"l 27 - 30\" \u2013 not a tie.\n- Week 14: December 10, 1960; opponent Los Angeles Chargers; result \"l 33 - 41\" \u2013 also not a tie.\n\nSo in 1960, the only tied game is on November 27, 1960. The claim says November 6, 1980, which isn't in the table. If it was a typo for 1960, then even so, November 6 isn't a tied game; that's a loss. Moreover, there is only one tied game recorded in the table, on November 27, 1960.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because:\n1. The date mentioned (November 6, 1980) doesn't exist in the table.\n2. Even if it was a typo for 1960, that specific date isn't tied; instead, another date has the tie.\n3. There's only one tied game in the table, so November 6, 1980, can't be the only record of a tied game as it doesn't exist.\n\nSo, compiling this, I need to show the relevant cells that support this conclusion. The relevant rows are where the result is a tie and any other weeks that might have been considered if there were more ties.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to November 6, 1980, which isn't present in the table (all data is from 1960). Additionally, there's only one tied game on November 27, 1960. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the game on november 13 , 1960 be hold at the cotton bowl site\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two specific pieces of information: the date of the game and the location where it was held.\n\nThe claim states that the game took place on November 13, 1960, at the Cotton Bowl site.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll need to find the row corresponding to November 13, 1960. Let me go through each entry:\n\nRow 0: September 9, 1960 \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 1: September 18, 1960 \u2013 nope.\nRow 2: September 23, 1960 \u2013 still not.\nRow 3: October 2, 1960 \u2013 moving on.\nRow 4: October 16, 1960 \u2013 no.\nRow 5: October 23, 1960 \u2013 not yet.\nRow 6: October 30, 1960 \u2013 getting closer.\nRow 7: November 6, 1960 \u2013 almost there.\nRow 8: November 13, 1960 \u2013 this is the date mentioned in the claim. So, row index 8 is relevant.\n\nNow, looking at row 8's details:\n- Date: \"november 13  , 1960\" which matches the claim.\n- Game site: The column for game site is one of the columns. Let me check what it says here.\n\nIn the data array, row 8 has \"cotton bowl\" as the game site. So the location mentioned in the table matches the claim's location.\n\nTherefore, both the date and the game site in the claim are correctly represented in row 8 of the table. Hence, the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells would be:\n- The date cell (column \"date\") in row 8.\n- The game site cell (column \"game site\") in row 8.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells list includes these two entries with their respective row indices and column names.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"the team's record be 4 - 4 when the attendance at the game be 9928.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down what each part of the claim is referring to. The two main conditions are:\n\n1. The team's record is 4-4.\n2. The attendance at that particular game is 9928.\n\nI need to check if there's a row in the table where both these conditions are met simultaneously.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it has columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, attendance. Each row represents a different game with various details.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n- **Row 0**: Attendance is 21597, which doesn't match 9928.\n- **Row 1**: Attendance is 15229 \u2013 not matching.\n- **Row 2**: Attendance 20462 \u2013 nope.\n- **Row 3**: 18372 \u2013 still not matching.\n- **Row 4**: 19141 \u2013 no.\n- **Row 5**: 12683 \u2013 close, but not exactly 9928.\n- **Row 6**: 13002 \u2013 nope.\n- **Row 7**: Attendance is 14489. Hmm, still not the target number.\n- **Row 8**: Here, attendance jumps to 21000. That's way higher than 9928.\n- **Row 9**: 20778 \u2013 no match.\n- **Row 10**: Attendance is 7785. Lower than 9928, so not a match.\n- **Row 11**: 5861 \u2013 also lower.\n- **Row 12**: Finally, I see attendance is 9928 in row 12.\n\nNow, checking the record for this row: It says \"4 - 8 - 1\". So the team's record isn't just 4-4; it includes a tie as well. The claim specifies the record should be exactly 4-4, not accounting for ties or additional losses beyond that.\n\nSince in the row where attendance is 9928, the record is \"4 - 8 - 1\", which doesn't match the claimed 4-4, the conditions aren't both satisfied. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim's conditions (record of 4-4 and attendance of 9928) are not met in any single row. The closest is row 12 with attendance 9928 but a record of 4-8-1.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"on november 13, 1960 the game site be the cotton bowl and the attendance be over 21000.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the data array provided in the JSON to find the one where the date is \"november 13, 1960\". Scanning through, I see that week 10 has the date as \"november 13  , 1960\".\n\nNext, for this row (row index 9), I need to check two things: the game site and the attendance. \n\nLooking at the \"game site\" column in row 9, it says \"cotton bowl\", which matches the claim.\n\nNow, checking the attendance in the same row, the value is 21000. The claim mentions that attendance was over 21000. Since 21000 is not more than 21000\u2014it's exactly equal\u2014the claim about attendance being over 21000 isn't supported.\n\nTherefore, while the game site condition is met, the attendance does not exceed 21000.
