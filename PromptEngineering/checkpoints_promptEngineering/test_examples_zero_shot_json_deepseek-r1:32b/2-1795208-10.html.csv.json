    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"jimmy white be list as the opponent in the final after 2009 at the paul hunter classic\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It seems like there might be a typo and it should say \"listed\" instead of \"be list.\" So the corrected claim would be: \"Jimmy White was listed as the opponent in the final after 2009 at the Paul Hunter Classic.\"\n\nNow, I'll look through the table to see if there's any information about Jimmy White being an opponent after 2009 in that specific championship.\n\nLooking at the columns, the relevant ones are \"year,\" \"championship,\" and \"opponent in the final.\" I need rows where:\n- The year is 2010 or later (since it's after 2009)\n- The championship is \"Paul Hunter Classic\"\n- The opponent in the final is Jimmy White\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Year is 2008, so not relevant.\nRow 1: Year 2008 again, same as above. Opponent is Mark Selby, not Jimmy White.\nRow 2: Year 2009. The championship is \"World Series - Grand Final.\" Not Paul Hunter Classic.\nRow 3: Year 2009. Championship is \"World Series - Champion of Champions Challenge,\" opponent is Jimmy White.\nRow 4: Year 2009, championship is \"Paul Hunter Classic,\" opponent is Jimmy White.\n\nWait, so row 4 shows that in 2009, the opponent was Jimmy White at the Paul Hunter Classic. But the claim says \"after 2009.\" So any entries after 2009 would be years 2010 onwards. Checking all rows, none of them have a year beyond 2009 except possibly row 4? No, row 4 is still 2009.\n\nTherefore, there's no data in the table for the Paul Hunter Classic after 2009 with Jimmy White as the opponent. The claim requires that such an entry exists post-2009, but it doesn't. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to events after 2009 at the Paul Hunter Classic where Jimmy White was the opponent in the final. Reviewing the data, all entries are from 2008 or 2009. There's no row with a year beyond 2009 for that championship.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"championship\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"jimmy white be the opponent in the final in the 2009 paul hunter classic\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. The columns are: outcome, year, championship, opponent in the final, score. So each row has data for a specific event.\n\nThe claim mentions three things:\n1. Jimmy White is the opponent.\n2. It's the 2009 Paul Hunter Classic.\n3. He was the opponent in the final of that event.\n\nI need to find a row where:\n- The year is 2009.\n- The championship is \"Paul Hunter Classic\".\n- The opponent in the final is Jimmy White.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\nRow 1: Runner-up, 2008, World Series - Berlin Event, Graeme Dott, 1-6. Not relevant since it's 2008 and a different championship.\n\nRow 2: Winner, 2008, Paul Hunter Classic, Mark Selby, 4-0. This is the Paul Hunter Classic but in 2008, so not matching the year mentioned.\n\nRow 3: Winner, 2009, World Series - Grand Final, John Higgins, 6-2. Not the correct championship.\n\nRow 4: Winner, 2009, World Series - Champion of Champions Challenge, Jimmy White, 5-1. This is a different championship as well.\n\nRow 5: Winner, 2009, Paul Hunter Classic, Jimmy White, 4-0. Here's the year 2009 and the correct championship \"Paul Hunter Classic\". The opponent in the final column says Jimmy White.\n\nWait, but wait. In Row 5, it shows that the outcome is a win with score 4-0 against Jimmy White in the Paul Hunter Classic of 2009. So according to this, the opponent was indeed Jimmy White in the 2009 event.\n\nBut I need to make sure that \"opponent in the final\" refers to who they played against in the finals. So if the claim is that Jimmy White was the opponent in the final of the 2009 Paul Hunter Classic, then Row 5 supports this because it shows Jimmy White as the opponent for that event and year.\n\nWait a second though: Let me check all rows again to make sure I'm not missing something. Rows 4 and 5 both are from 2009 but different championships. So row 5 is specifically the Paul Hunter Classic in 2009, with Jimmy White as the opponent. That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nSo based on this, the claim is TRUE because the table shows that in 2009's Paul Hunter Classic, Jimmy White was the opponent in the final.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by row 4 of the data, which indicates that Jimmy White was indeed the opponent in the final of the 2009 Paul Hunter Classic.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"championship\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table data in JSON format. The claim states: \"jimmy white be the opponent in the final after 2008 at the paul hunter classic with the outcome be runner up.\" Let's break down each part of this claim and cross-reference it against the table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim into its components:\n1. The opponent in the final is Jimmy White.\n2. This occurred after the year 2008.\n3. The event was the Paul Hunter Classic.\n4. The outcome was that Jimmy White was a runner-up.\n\nNow, looking at the table, it has columns: outcome, year, championship, opponent in the final, and score. There are five rows of data.\n\nI need to find entries where:\n- Championship is \"paul hunter classic\"\n- Year is after 2008 (so 2009 or later)\n- Opponent in the final is Jimmy White\n- Outcome is \"runner-up\"\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Outcome is runner-up, year 2008. Championship is world series - berlin event. Opponent is Graeme Dott. Doesn't match.\n\nRow 1: Outcome winner, 2008. Championship Paul Hunter Classic. Opponent Mark Selby. Not relevant as outcome isn't runner-up and opponent isn't Jimmy White.\n\nRow 2: Winner in 2009 at World Series - Grand Final. Opponent John Higgins. Not related to the claim.\n\nRow 3: Winner in 2009 at World Series - Champion of Champions Challenge. Opponent is Jimmy White. However, outcome is winner, not runner-up.\n\nRow 4: Winner in 2009 at Paul Hunter Classic. Opponent is Jimmy White. Again, outcome is winner, so Jimmy White was the opponent but the claim says outcome was runner-up. So this doesn't fit.\n\nLooking for rows where championship is Paul Hunter Classic and year > 2008 (so 2009). Rows 1 and 4 are in Paul Hunter Classic, but row 1 is 2008 which is not after 2008. Row 4 is 2009, opponent is Jimmy White, but outcome is winner, not runner-up.\n\nThus, there's no entry where the championship is Paul Hunter Classic, year >2008, opponent is Jimmy White, and outcome is runner-up. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"championship\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"outcome\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
