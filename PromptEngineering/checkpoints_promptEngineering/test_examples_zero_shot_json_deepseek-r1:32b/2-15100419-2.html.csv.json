    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"there be no defensive end pick and an overall smaller than 2\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim into two parts: \n\n1. There should be no defensive end picks.\n2. There should be a pick with an overall number smaller than 2.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to check for defensive ends and their overall numbers.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Row 0: Position is linebacker, not defensive end. Overall is 2.\n- Row 1: Position is defensive end. Overall is 33.\n- Row 2: Position is center. Overall is 60.\n- Rows 3 to 9 have positions like cornerback, wide receiver, guard, etc., none are defensive end.\n\nSo, there is at least one defensive end pick (Row 1), which means the first part of the claim (\"there be no defensive end pick\") is false. Since both conditions must hold for the entire claim to be true, this makes the claim FALSE.\n\nAdditionally, checking for overall numbers smaller than 2: Row 0 has an overall of 2, so nothing is less than 2. Therefore, even if there were no defensive ends, since the second condition isn't met either, the claim still fails.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
