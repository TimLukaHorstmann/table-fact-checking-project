    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"princess mary marry william ii before she be 12\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, let me parse the table structure. The columns are: order, name dates, princess royal from (date) to (date), parent, date married, husband dates.\n\nLooking at the data, I see multiple entries for princesses named Mary and Anne, so I need to identify which one is relevant here.\n\nThe claim mentions \"princess mary\" marrying \"william ii\". From the table, let's look through each row:\n\nRow 1: Mary, Princess Royal (1631-1660), married William II in 1641. She was born in 1631. So when she married in 1641, her age would be 1641 - 1631 = 10 years old. Wait, that's 10, which is before 12? No, wait, 10 is less than 12, so technically she was 10 when married.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"before she be 12\", meaning before turning 12, right? So if she married at 10, that's indeed before 12. Hmm, but let me check the exact dates again.\n\nLooking at Row 1: date married is 1641, and her birth year is 1631. So 1641 - 1631 = 10 years old when she married William II.\n\nSo according to this data, Princess Mary was married at age 10, which is before she turned 12. Therefore, the claim would be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another princess named Mary in the table. There's another Mary in Row 6: born in 1897, married in 1922. That's age 25, which is much older, so not relevant here.\n\nSo only Row 1 pertains to Princess Mary marrying William II before turning 12.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as per the data showing Mary was 10 when she married William II.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date married\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"princess louise do not married until she be around 38 year old\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions Princess Louise and states that she didn't marry until she was about 38 years old. I need to check if this aligns with the information in the table. \n\nLooking at the table's columns: \"order\", \"name dates\", \"princess royal from (date) to (date)\", \"parent\", \"date married\", and \"husband dates\". The relevant columns here would be \"name dates\" for her birth year, \"date married\" to find out when she got married, and maybe the \"husband dates\" if needed.\n\nLet me scan through each row in the data array to find Princess Louise. Scanning:\n\nRow 1: Mary, born in 1631.\nRow 2: Anne, 1709-1759.\nRow 3: Charlotte, 1766-1828.\nRow 4: Victoria, 1840-1901.\nRow 5: Louise, princess royal, born in 1867. This is the one we're interested in.\n\nSo row index 4 (since counting starts at 0) has Princess Victoria, but row 5 is Louise. Wait, actually, let me recount:\n\nRows are zero-indexed? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the data array:\nRow 0: Mary\nRow 1: Anne\nRow 2: Charlotte\nRow 3: Victoria\nRow 4: Louise (name is Louise)\nYes, row index 4.\n\nSo, in row 4, \"name dates\" is \"louise  , princess royal 1867  - 1931\". So she was born in 1867. The \"date married\" column for her is 1889. \n\nWait, let me confirm: the columns are order, name dates, princess royal from to, parent, date married, husband dates.\n\nSo in row 4 (index starts at 0):\n\nRow index 5 corresponds to Louise? Wait no, looking back:\n\nThe data array has seven rows starting from index 0 to 6. Let me list them:\n\nIndex 0: Mary\nIndex 1: Anne\nIndex 2: Charlotte\nIndex 3: Victoria\nIndex 4: Louise\nIndex 5: Mary again (another princess)\nIndex 6: Anne again\n\nWait, no. Wait the data array has seven entries, indexes 0 to 6.\n\nRow index 0: order 1, name Mary.\nRow index 1: order 2, name Anne.\nRow index 2: order3, Charlotte.\nRow index3: order4, Victoria.\nRow index4: order5, Louise.\nRow index5: order6, Mary again.\nRow index6: order7, Anne again.\n\nSo for Princess Louise, it's row index4. So her \"name dates\" are \"louise , princess royal 1867 - 1931\". She was born in 1867. The \"date married\" is 1889.\n\nNow, to find out how old she was when she married: subtract her birth year from the marriage year.\n\nSo 1889 minus 1867 equals 22 years old. So according to the table, Louise married at age 22.\n\nThe claim says she didn't marry until around 38. But according to the data, she married much earlier, at 22. That means the claim is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because the claim states she married around 38, but the table shows she married in 1889 when she was only 22.\n\nNow, which cells are relevant? The \"name dates\" to get her birth year and the \"date married\" to know when she got married. So:\n\nRelevant cells:\n- row_index:4, column_name:\"name dates\"\n- row_index:4, column_name:\"date married\"\n\nSo the JSON response should have answer: FALSE and these two relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date married\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It states that Princess Anne, who is the daughter of Elizabeth II, has had two husbands. I'll need to check the table for any entries related to Princess Anne and look into her marital history.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the relevant columns are \"name dates\", \"princess royal from (date) to (date)\", \"parent\", \"date married\", and \"husband dates\". The rows go from 1 to 7. I see that in row 7, there's an entry for \"anne, princess royal 1950 -\". Her parent is listed as Elizabeth II.\n\nNow, examining the details for Anne: she was princess royal from 1987 onwards and her marriage dates are mentioned in two rows under different husbands. In row 7, it shows that she married Mark Phillips in 1973 until 1992. Then, there's another entry also at row 7 (I notice the same row index is used twice) indicating a marriage to Sir Timothy Laurence starting in 1992.\n\nWait, actually, looking closely, both entries are in row 7 but with different husband names and dates. The first marriage was from 1973 to 1992, and then she remarried in 1992. So that's two marriages, hence two husbands.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Princess Anne has indeed been married twice, once to Mark Phillips and later to Sir Timothy Laurence.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table showing Princess Anne's two marriages.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** Look for entries where the parent is Elizabeth II. The relevant rows are both row 7 entries as they list Anne, Princess Royal, with parent Elizabeth II.\n\n2. **Check Marriage Details:** In row 7, under \"date married\", there are two separate dates: 1973-1992 and 1992. Corresponding \"husband dates\" show Mark Phillips (1948-) from 1973-1992 and Sir Timothy Laurence (1955-) starting in 1992.\n\n3. **Determine Number of Husbands:** Since there are two distinct husbands listed for Anne, this confirms she has been married twice.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date married\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"}\n   ]\n}",

The columns are: order, name dates, princess royal from (date) to (date), parent, date married, and husband dates. Each row represents a different princess.\n\nThe claim mentions Princess Anne of Elizabeth being the only one to have gotten a divorce. So I need to check if any other princesses besides Anne had marriages that ended in divorce.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Mary: Married in 1641, husband William II died in 1650. No indication of divorce.\n2. Anne (row 2): Married in 1734, husband William IV died in 1751. No divorce here either.\n3. Charlotte: Married in 1797, husband Frederick I died in 1816. No divorce noted.\n4. Victoria: Married in 1858, husband Frederick III died in 1888. No divorce mentioned.\n5. Louise: Married in 1889, husband Alexander Duff died in 1912. Again, no divorce information.\n6. Mary (row 6): Married in 1922, husband Henry Lascelles died in 1947. No divorce here.\n7. Anne (row 7 and 8): Married from 1973-1992 to Mark Phillips, then remarried in 1992 to Sir Timothy Laurence. The duration of the first marriage is listed as 1973-1992, suggesting a divorce in 1992.\n\nWait, but row 8 also shows Anne with the same name and same princess dates, parent, and different husband dates. So it seems that Anne had two marriages: one ending in 1992 (divorce) and another starting in 1992. \n\nSo only Princess Anne has a marriage listed as ending in 1992, which I infer is a divorce since the next entry shows her remarried. All other princesses' husbands died before them, so their marriages ended due to death, not divorce.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true: Princess Anne is the only one who got divorced.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Princess Anne of Elizabeth is the only princess in the list to have gotten a divorce. Checking each row for any indication of divorce, only row 7 and 8 for Anne show a remarriage after 1992, indicating a prior divorce.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n- **Identify Relevant Rows:** Look for entries where the marriage ended before the princess's death.\n- **Check Divorce Indicators:** A remarriage within the same name suggests a previous divorce (rows 7 and 8 for Anne).\n- **Compare with Others:** All other princesses' husbands died, ending their marriages naturally without divorce.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date married\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"prince mary of charles i die before age 40\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It mentions \"Prince Mary of Charles I.\" Wait, that seems a bit off because Mary would typically be a princess, not a prince. Maybe it's a typo and should be \"Princess Mary\"? Also, the subject is related to Charles I, so we're looking for entries where the parent is Charles I.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple columns: order, name dates, princess royal from (date) to (date), parent, date married, husband dates. Each row represents a different Princess Royal with various details.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\nRow 1:\n- Name: Mary, Princess Royal 1631 - 1660\n- Parent: Charles I 1600 - 1649\n\nOkay, this seems to match the claim. Mary is the daughter of Charles I. Now, let's check her death date. The name dates are from 1631 to 1660, so she died in 1660.\n\nNow, to find out if she died before age 40, we need her birth and death years. She was born in 1631 and died in 1660. Let's calculate her age at death: 1660 - 1631 = 29 years old. So she died at 29, which is indeed before 40.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says \"prince mary of charles i die before age 40.\" Since Mary was born in 1631 and died in 1660, that's correct. But I should double-check other rows to ensure there isn't another Mary related to Charles I or any possible confusion.\n\nLooking at the other rows:\n\nRow 2: Anne, daughter of George II\nRow 3: Charlotte, daughter of George III\nRow 4: Victoria, daughter of Queen Victoria\nRow 5: Louise, daughter of Edward VII\nRow 6: Mary, daughter of George V (born in 1897)\nRows 7 and 8: Anne, daughter of Elizabeth II\n\nNone of these are related to Charles I except Row 1. So the only relevant entry is Row 1.\n\nNow, checking if there's any other information about her death age or parentage. The parent column clearly states Charles I. Her name is Mary, which aligns with the claim referring to Prince Mary, although it should be Princess Mary.\n\nSo, all conditions point towards the claim being true. She died at 29, well before 40.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to Princess Mary, daughter of Charles I, who died in 1660 at age 29. The relevant cell is row 0 (since indexing starts at 0), column \"name dates\" where her lifespan is recorded.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"princess mary marry her husband william ii after her 12th birthday\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look for Princess Mary in the table. Looking at the 'name dates' column, there are two entries with \"mary\": one from 1631-1660 and another from 1897-1965. The first one is under row index 0, and the second under row 5.\n\nNow, the claim mentions marrying William II. Let's see who their husbands are. For the first Mary (row 0), her husband is \"william ii, prince of orange 1626-1650\". The second Mary (row 5) married Henry Lascelles, so that's not relevant here.\n\nSo focusing on row 0: Princess Mary married William II. Now, when did they get married? The 'date married' column for this entry is 1641. When was Mary born? Her name dates are \"mary, princess royal 1631-1660\", so she was born in 1631.\n\nTo determine if she was older than 12 when she married, we subtract her birth year from the marriage year: 1641 - 1631 = 10 years old. That means she was 10 years old when she got married. The claim says \"after her 12th birthday,\" which would mean she was at least 13 or older.\n\nSince 10 is less than 12, the claim that she married after her 12th birthday is false. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Princess Mary married William II after turning 12. Checking the relevant cells:\n\n- The marriage year is 1641 (row 0, 'date married').\n- Mary was born in 1631 (row 0, 'name dates').\n\nShe was 10 when she married, so she hadn't reached her 12th birthday yet. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date married\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for Princess Anne in the table. Scanning through the data, I see two entries with the name \"anne , princess royal\". Both are under Elizabeth II as their parent since her reign started in 1952 and she is still alive (indicated by \"-\" in the date). So, these are the relevant rows: row index 6 and 7.\n\nNext, I need to check the number of husbands for Princess Anne. The claim states that she has only one husband. Looking at the \"husband dates\" column for both entries:\n\n- Row 6 shows \"mark phillips 1948 -\".\n- Row 7 lists \"sir timothy laurence 1955 -\".\n\nThis indicates two different husbands: Mark Phillips and Sir Timothy Laurence. The first marriage was from 1973 to 1992, and the second started in 1992.\n\nSince there are two entries for Princess Anne's marriages with different husbands, this means she has been married twice, not once.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim and identify the key elements: princess Louise married Edward VII before she was 20 years old. So, I need to check two things in the table: when Princess Louise got married and whether that happened before she turned 20.\n\nLooking at the table columns:\n- \"order\"\n- \"name dates\"\n- \"princess royal from (date) to (date)\"\n- \"parent\"\n- \"date married\"\n- \"husband dates\"\n\nI'll search for the row where the name is Princess Louise. Scanning through the data, I see row 5: \n[5, \"louise , princess royal 1867 - 1931\", ...]\n\nSo, her birth year is 1867 and she died in 1931.\n\nNext, I need to find out when she got married. The relevant column for marriage date is \"date married\". In row 5, the \"date married\" is listed as 1889.\n\nNow, let's calculate her age at the time of marriage. If she was born in 1867 and married in 1889, subtracting those gives us 22 years old (1889 - 1867 = 22). \n\nWait a minute, but the claim says she married before the age of 20. However, according to this calculation, she was 22 when she got married. That means the claim is not accurate.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if Edward VII is her husband. Looking at row 5's \"husband dates\" column, it says \"alexander duff , 1st duke of fife 1849 - 1912\". So her husband wasn't Edward VII but Alexander Duff. But the claim mentions Edward VII as her spouse, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, that might be a confusion because in the table, Princess Louise's parent is listed under \"parent\" as \"edward vii 1841 - 1910\". Wait no, looking back: row 5's parent is \"edward vii 1841 - 1910\". So Edward VII was her father. Therefore, the claim incorrectly states that she married Edward VII, but actually, Edward VII was her father.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n- Princess Louise was born in 1867.\n- She got married in 1889 at age 22.\n- Her husband was Alexander Duff, not Edward VII.\n- Edward VII is listed as her parent (father), so he's older than her.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"princess louise marry edward vii before the age of 20\" is FALSE. She married someone else at 22 years old, and Edward VII was her father, not her husband.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Princess Louise married Alexander Duff in 1889 at the age of 22, and Edward VII was her father.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date married\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It states that Princess Anne (of Elizabeth) is one of three princesses in the list who had a divorce. So, I need to check two things: \n1. How many princesses have a divorce.\n2. Whether Princess Anne is among them and whether she is counted as one out of three.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n- The columns are \"order\", \"name dates\", \"princess royal from (date) to (date)\", \"parent\", \"date married\", and \"husband dates\".\n- The relevant information for determining divorce would likely be in the \"husband dates\" column, as a divorce might be indicated by a change or end date without remarriage.\n\nNow, let's go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Mary, Princess Royal (1631 - 1660). Husband is William II, Prince of Orange (1626 - 1650). The husband died in 1650, so it doesn't indicate a divorce; she outlived him.\n\n2. Row 1: Anne, Princess Royal (1709 - 1759). Husband is William IV, Prince of Orange (1711 - 1751). He died in 1751, so no indication of divorce.\n\n3. Row 2: Charlotte, Princess Royal (1766 - 1828). Husband is Frederick I of W\u00fcrttemberg (1754 - 1816). Died during their marriage, so no divorce here.\n\n4. Row 3: Victoria, Princess Royal (1840 - 1901). Married in 1858 to Frederick III, German Emperor (1831 - 1888). He died in 1888, so again, death, not divorce.\n\n5. Row 4: Louise, Princess Royal (1867 - 1931). Married in 1889 to Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife (1849 - 1912). He died in 1912; no divorce indicated.\n\n6. Row 5: Mary, Princess Royal (1897 - 1965). Married in 1922 to Henry Lascelles, 6th Earl of Harewood (1882 - 1947). He died in 1947; no divorce here.\n\n7. Rows 6 and 7: Anne, Princess Royal (1950 - ). She is the daughter of Elizabeth II. Her marriage details show two entries:\n   - First husband: Mark Phillips (married 1973 - 1992). The end date here suggests a divorce.\n   - Second husband: Sir Timothy Laurence (married in 1992, ongoing as per \"present\" and his birth year).\n\nSo, Princess Anne has two marriages with the first ending in 1992. Since she remarried, it's clear that her first marriage was dissolved by divorce.\n\nNow, let's check how many princesses have a divorce:\n- Only Princess Anne has an entry where her marriage ended before remarrying. All others either remained married until death or have only one marriage listed without a second husband indicating a prior divorce.\n\nTherefore, the claim states that she is \"1 of 3\" princesses who had a divorce, but according to the table, there's only one princess (Anne) with a divorce. This makes the claim FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date married\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"princess mary of charles i die before she turn 25\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim. It mentions \"Princess Mary\" and her father being Charles I. So my first task is to find the row in the table that corresponds to Princess Mary whose parent is Charles I.\n\nLooking through the data rows:\n\n- Row 0: Order 1, name is \"mary , princess royal 1631 - 1660\", parent is \"charles i 1600 - 1649\". This matches because it's Princess Mary with Charles I as her parent.\n\nNext, the claim says she died before turning 25. To verify this, I need to check her death year and calculate if she was under 25 when she passed away.\n\nFrom the table:\n- The \"name dates\" column for row 0 is \"mary , princess royal 1631 - 1660\", indicating she was born in 1631 and died in 1660.\n- Calculating her age at death: 1660 - 1631 = 29 years old. So she was 29 when she died.\n\nSince 29 is more than 25, the claim that she died before turning 25 is false.\n\nAdditionally, checking other columns for relevant information:\n- \"princess royal from (date) to (date)\": 1642 - 1660. Doesn't affect age at death.\n- \"date married\": 1641. Not relevant here.\n- \"husband dates\": William II, who died in 1650. She outlived him by ten years.\n\nSo the only relevant cells are from row 0:\n- \"name dates\" to get her lifespan.\n- \"parent\" to confirm it's Charles I.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Princess Mary lived beyond 25 years old.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Princess Mary of Charles I died before turning 25. From the table, we find she was born in 1631 and died in 1660 at age 29, which contradicts the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"parent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
