    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"michael bradley jelani mccoy (14) have the highest rebound against miami\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions that Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy had 14 rebounds each in a game against Miami. So, I need to find any row where the opponent was Miami and check the \"high rebounds\" column for those players with 14 rebounds.\n\nLooking at the table data:\n\n- The rows are indexed from 0 to 8.\n- Each row has a \"team\" which indicates the opponent. We're interested in games against Miami, so I'll look through each team column.\n\nChecking each row:\n- Row 0: Team is Detroit\n- Row 1: Team is Detroit\n- Row 2: Team is San Antonio\n- Row 3: Team is New Jersey\n- Row 4: Team is Miami. This is the game against Miami.\n- Row 5: Team is Orlando\n- Row 6: Team is Milwaukee\n- Row 7: Team is New Jersey\n- Row 8: Team is Miami. Another game against Miami.\n\nSo, there are two games against Miami: row indices 4 and 8.\n\nNow, checking the \"high rebounds\" column for these rows:\n\nRow 4 (index 4):\nThe \"high rebounds\" value is \"michael bradley  (8)\". So Michael Bradley had 8 rebounds here. There's no mention of Jelani McCoy in this row's high rebounds.\n\nRow 8 (index 8):\nThe \"high rebounds\" value is \"jerome williams  (17)\", so the highest rebound was by Jerome Williams with 17, not 14. Neither Michael Bradley nor Jelani McCoy are mentioned here with 14 rebounds.\n\nWait, but looking back at row index 0 and 2:\n\nRow 0: Team is Detroit, \"high rebounds\" is \"michael bradley , jelani mccoy (14)\". So both had 14 rebounds. But this game was against Detroit, not Miami.\n\nSimilarly, in other rows against non-Miami teams, like row 3 and others, the high rebounds don't include Miami as the opponent.\n\nSo, the claim is that Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy had 14 rebounds each against Miami, but from the table data, their high rebounds of 14 were against Detroit (row 0). In both games against Miami, neither player had 14 rebounds. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
