    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim about Tony Lema's participation in various tournaments is true or false based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"Tournament that tony lema have participate in include the master tournament, the us open, the pga championship and the open championship.\" So, I need to check if Tony Lema participated in all four of these tournaments according to the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are \"tournament,\" \"wins,\" \"top -5,\" \"top -10,\" \"top -25,\" \"events,\" and \"cuts made.\" The rows include data for each tournament and a totals row. \n\nThe claim lists four specific tournaments: Masters Tournament, US Open, PGA Championship, and The Open Championship. I'll go through each one to see if they are present in the table.\n\n1. **Masters Tournament**: In the first row of the data array (index 0), the tournament is \"masters tournament.\" This matches the claim, so it's included.\n\n2. **US Open**: The second row (index 1) lists \"us open,\" which also matches the claim. So that's another one covered.\n\n3. **PGA Championship**: Looking at the fourth row (index 3), the tournament is \"pga championship.\" This aligns with what's stated in the claim, so it's included as well.\n\n4. **The Open Championship**: The third row (index 2) has \"the open championship,\" which matches the claim exactly.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies here. Each of the four tournaments mentioned in the claim is present in the table under the \"tournament\" column with their respective data. There's no missing tournament from the list provided in the claim, and all four are accounted for in the table rows 0 to 3.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider if there's any information that might contradict the participation of Tony Lema. The table includes columns like \"wins,\" \"top -5,\" etc., but since the claim is about participation, not performance metrics, those details aren't directly relevant here. However, seeing non-zero values in some of these columns (like 1 win for The Open Championship) might imply some level of performance, which could support that he did participate.\n\nAnother point to consider: Is there a totals row? Yes, the last row (index 4) sums up across all tournaments but doesn't list any specific tournament name. Since it's labeled \"totals,\" it doesn't affect the presence or absence of the four tournaments in question.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each of the four tournaments mentioned in the claim is present in the table under the \"tournament\" column with their respective data rows. Therefore, the claim that Tony Lema participated in all these tournaments is fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"tony lema be in the top 5 for the master tournament, the us open, and the open championship.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like Tony Lema participated in three tournaments: Masters Tournament, US Open, and The Open Championship. The claim is stating that he was in the top 5 in all three of these events.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns named \"tournament\", \"wins\", \"top - 5\", \"top -10\", \"top -25\", \"events\", and \"cuts made\". So for each tournament row, there's a value under \"top - 5\" which indicates how many times the player was in the top 5.\n\nI need to check each of the three tournaments mentioned: Masters Tournament, US Open, and The Open Championship. I'll look at their respective rows and find the values under the \"top - 5\" column.\n\nStarting with the Masters Tournament row:\n- Row index is 0.\n- Under \"top - 5\", it's value is 1.\n\nNext, the US Open row:\n- Row index is 1.\n- Under \"top - 5\", it's value is 2.\n\nThen, The Open Championship row:\n- Row index is 2.\n- Under \"top - 5\", it's value is 2.\n\nSo for each tournament, Tony Lema was in the top 5 at least once. In the Masters Tournament, he was there once; in the US Open twice; and in The Open Championship twice as well. \n\nWait a second, but the claim says \"be in the top 5\" for each of these tournaments. Does that mean he had to be in the top 5 at least once? If so, then yes, because all three have non-zero values under \"top - 5\". \n\nSo, since each of the three tournaments shows a number greater than zero in the \"top -5\" column, it means Tony Lema was indeed in the top 5 for each one. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the \"top - 5\" values for each tournament, which are all non-zero, indicating Tony Lema was in the top 5 for each.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"top - 5\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"top - 5\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"top - 5\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine whether the claim \"the only tournament that tony lema win in be the open championship\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: tournament, wins, top-5, top-10, top-25, events, cuts made. The data has five rows: each corresponding to a different tournament and their respective statistics.\n\nThe claim is about Tony Lema winning only in \"the open championship.\" So, I need to check the 'wins' column for each tournament to see if that's the case.\n\nLooking at each row:\n1. Masters Tournament: wins = 0\n2. US Open: wins = 0\n3. The Open Championship: wins = 1\n4. PGA Championship: wins = 0\n5. Totals: wins = 1\n\nFrom this, it seems that \"the open championship\" is the only tournament where Tony Lema has a win (wins=1). All other tournaments show zero wins. Therefore, the claim appears to be supported by the data.\n\nNext, I'll identify the relevant cells used to verify this. The 'wins' column across all tournaments is crucial. So, for each row, the 'wins' column is checked:\n\n- Masters Tournament: row 0, wins\n- US Open: row 1, wins\n- The Open Championship: row 2, wins\n- PGA Championship: row 3, wins\n- Totals: row 4, wins\n\nThese cells confirm that only \"the open championship\" has a win.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"tony lema do not win in the us open\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the table structure, it has columns: tournament, wins, top-5, top-10, top-25, events, and cuts made. The rows include different tournaments like \"masters tournament\", \"us open\", etc., along with a totals row at the end.\n\nThe claim is about Tony Lema not winning in the US Open. So I need to check if there are any wins by Tony Lema in the US Open as per the table.\n\nLooking at the data, each row represents a different tournament and their corresponding statistics. The second column is \"wins\". For the \"us open\" row, the value under \"wins\" is 0. That means there were zero wins recorded for that tournament.\n\nBut wait, does this mean Tony Lema didn't win? Hmm. The table might be summarizing data across all participants, not specific to a player. So if the total wins in US Open are 0, it suggests no one won it, which doesn't make sense because every tournament has a winner. Alternatively, perhaps the table is showing each participant's performance across tournaments.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me look again. The \"us open\" row shows 0 under \"wins\". So in that case, if the claim is about Tony Lema not winning, but according to this, the US Open has zero wins recorded. That might mean no one won it, which doesn't align with reality because I know the US Open does have winners each year.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is showing each player's performance across tournaments. But in that case, where is Tony Lema's row? Looking at the data, I don't see a row for \"tony lema\". The rows are \"masters tournament\", \"us open\", etc., so it seems like these are the tournaments themselves, not individual players.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the table is aggregating statistics across all players in each tournament. So for the US Open, under \"wins\" it's 0, which doesn't make sense because every US Open has a winner. This makes me think there might be an issue with interpreting the table correctly.\n\nWait another thought: maybe the \"wins\" column refers to how many times this specific player won each tournament. But since the rows are the tournaments, not players, that might not be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a totals row at the end showing overall wins across all tournaments, but in the US Open row, the wins are 0.\n\nBut I know for a fact that Tony Lema won the US Open in 1965. So according to real-world knowledge, the claim \"tony lema do not win in the us open\" would be FALSE because he did win it.\n\nHowever, based solely on the table provided, if the US Open has 0 wins, then maybe the table is incomplete or incorrect. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding what each row represents. If each row is a player's performance across tournaments, but there's no row for Tony Lema, then we can't confirm his wins from this data.\n\nWait, looking back at the data:\n\nThe rows are:\n1. masters tournament\n2. us open\n3. the open championship\n4. pga championship\n5. totals\n\nSo each of these is a different major golf tournament. The columns include \"wins\". For example, in the \"the open championship\" row, \"wins\" is 1. So that might mean that across all participants, there was one win in that tournament.\n\nBut then, for the US Open, \"wins\" is 0, which contradicts reality because every US Open has a winner. Therefore, perhaps the table's data isn't accurate or it's structured differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row represents a specific player's performance across tournaments, but without knowing who those players are, it's hard to say. But in this case, the rows are named after tournaments, not players.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because then \"wins\" would refer to how many times that tournament was won by someone, which should be at least 1 each year. So I'm confused about why US Open has 0 wins here.\n\nGiven this confusion and the lack of specific player data (like Tony Lema) in the table, it's impossible to confirm or deny his victory in the US Open based solely on this table. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified as TRUE because the information isn't present, but since I know from external knowledge that he did win, the correct answer would be FALSE.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I should only consider the data provided. Since there's no mention of Tony Lema in the table, and the US Open has 0 wins which doesn't align with reality, perhaps the claim is considered TRUE because there's no evidence of a win in the US Open as per the table.\n\nWait, but if the table says 0 wins for US Open, that would mean no one won it, which contradicts real events. So maybe the table is incorrect or misinterpreted. Alternatively, perhaps \"wins\" refers to something else, like top-5 finishes or similar.\n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of specific player data, I think the claim can't be confirmed from the table. Therefore, based on the provided data alone, there's no indication that Tony Lema won the US Open, so the claim could be considered TRUE because it says he didn't win. But this is confusing because in reality, he did.\n\nBut sticking strictly to the table: since the US Open row has 0 under \"wins\", perhaps it means that among the data presented, there were no wins for the US Open, which would imply that Tony Lema (if included) didn't win. However, without his specific row, it's unclear.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the table provided, since there's no data about Tony Lema and the US Open's \"wins\" are 0, the claim might be considered TRUE as per the data, even though in reality it's FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that for the \"us open\" tournament, the number of wins is 0. Since the claim states that Tony Lema did not win in the US Open and there are no wins recorded for the US Open in the table, the claim is supported by the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"tony lema make it to the top 10 in the pga championship, but do not continue on.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. It says Tony Lema reached the top 10 in the PGA Championship, which I think refers to his performance ranking. The second part mentions he \"do not continue on,\" which I believe implies that he didn't make further progress beyond a certain point, perhaps meaning he was cut or didn't advance in the tournament.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are: tournament, wins, top 5, top 10, top 25, events, cuts made. The rows include four tournaments and totals. The relevant row for the PGA Championship is the fourth one (index 3) since indexing starts from 0.\n\nThe claim mentions \"top 10,\" so I should check the \"top - 10\" column in the PGA Championship row. According to the table, under \"top - 10\" for PGA Championship, the value is 1. This means that only one player made it into the top 10.\n\nThe claim says Tony Lema was among them, which seems possible since there's at least one person in top 10. However, the second part of the claim states he didn't continue on. The \"cuts made\" column for PGA Championship is 4, which I assume indicates how many players were cut or did not advance further.\n\nSince Tony Lema was in the top 10 (as indicated by the value 1 in that cell), but given that only one person reached top 10 and four cuts were made, it's possible he didn't make it past that point. However, without specific information about individual players like Tony Lema, I can't confirm his exact standing or whether he was cut.\n\nWait, the table doesn't list individual players; it aggregates data for each tournament. So while the top 10 count is 1, it's unclear if Tony Lema is that one person or someone else. Moreover, the \"cuts made\" refers to how many times cuts were made in events, not necessarily whether a specific player was cut.\n\nTherefore, I can't definitively confirm both parts of the claim because the table doesn't provide individual player data, only aggregated stats for each tournament.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be fully supported by the provided table as it lacks specific player details. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"top - 10\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The goal is to determine if the claim about Tony Lema's participation in various golf tournaments is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim: \"tournament that tony lema have not participate in include the master tournament, the us open, the pga championship and the open championship.\" So, the claim states that Tony Lema did NOT participate in any of these four tournaments. \n\nLooking at the table structure, it lists several tournaments with various statistics like wins, top-5 finishes, etc. The key here is to find out whether Tony Lema participated in these tournaments by checking if there are any entries indicating his participation.\n\nThe relevant data rows are:\n1. \"masters tournament\"\n2. \"us open\"\n3. \"the open championship\"\n4. \"pga championship\"\n\nFor each of these tournaments, the claim states that Tony did not participate. To verify this, we'll check if Tony has any wins or other performances in these tournaments as listed in the table.\n\nStarting with the \"masters tournament\" (row 0), the number of wins is 0. This suggests that Tony didn't win this event. However, the presence of a row itself indicates that he participated enough to be counted, perhaps through cuts made or events entered.\n\nLooking at the \"cuts made\" column for each tournament:\n- Masters: Cuts made = 4\n- US Open: Cuts made =5 \n- The Open Championship: Cuts made=3\n- PGA Championship: Cuts made=4\n\nThese numbers suggest that Tony participated in these tournaments, as 'cuts made' typically refers to the number of times he advanced beyond the initial rounds. If he didn't participate at all, we might expect a zero or no entry.\n\nMoreover, the \"events\" column shows the number of events he played in each tournament:\n- Masters: 4\n- US Open:6 \n- The Open Championship:3\n- PGA Championship:5\n\nThese are positive numbers, indicating participation. \n\nIn contrast, if Tony had not participated at all in a tournament, we might expect zeros or perhaps no rows for those tournaments. However, since these tournaments do have entries with non-zero 'events' and 'cuts made,' it's clear that he did participate.\n\nTherefore, the claim that he didn't participate in any of these four tournaments is FALSE because the data shows he participated in all of them to some extent.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the table indicates Tony Lema participated in all the listed tournaments through non-zero 'events' and 'cuts made'.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\":0, \"column_name\":\"cuts made\"},\n    {\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\":\"cuts made\"},\n    {\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\":\"cuts made\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"cuts made\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about Tony Lema being in the top 5 for three different tournaments is true or false based on the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the table represents. The columns are \"tournament\", \"wins\", \"top - 5\", \"top - 10\", \"top - 25\", \"events\", and \"cuts made\". Each row corresponds to a different tournament or totals. So, for each tournament like the Masters Tournament, US Open, etc., we have some statistics.\n\nThe claim is: \"Tony Lema be in the top 5 for the pga championship, the us open, and the open championship.\" Wait, that doesn't quite make sense grammatically. I think it should say something like \"Tony Lema was in the top 5 of the PGA Championship, the US Open, and The Open Championship.\" Maybe there was a typo or mistake in the wording.\n\nAssuming that's what they meant, we need to check for each tournament if Tony Lema was in the top 5. But looking at the table, I don't see any mention of \"Tony Lema\" anywhere. The rows are about different tournaments and their totals, not individual players. So the data doesn't include information about specific golfers; it's more about aggregate statistics for each event.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the claim is referring to whether these tournaments have certain numbers in the \"top - 5\" column? Let me check that.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. **Masters Tournament**: top-5 = 1\n2. **US Open**: top-5 = 2\n3. **The Open Championship**: top-5 = 2\n4. **PGA Championship**: top-5 = 0\n\nSo for each tournament, the number in the \"top - 5\" column indicates how many times someone was in the top 5? Or maybe it's the count of players who made the cut to top 5? Hmm, not entirely clear, but let's proceed.\n\nThe claim says Tony Lema was in the top 5 for each of these tournaments. But since there's no data about individual players like Tony Lema, we can't verify this. Alternatively, if \"top -5\" refers to how many times someone from that tournament made it into the top 5 across events, but again, without specific player info, it's impossible to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about the tournaments having at least one person in their top 5. Looking at the numbers:\n\n- US Open has a \"top -5\" value of 2.\n- The Open Championship has 2.\n- PGA Championship has 0.\n\nSo for the PGA Championship, there's no one in the top 5 according to this table. That would mean Tony Lema couldn't have been in the top 5 for that event because it says 0.\n\nTherefore, since thePGA Championship has a \"top -5\" of 0, it's impossible for Tony Lema or anyone else to be in the top 5 there. Hence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Tony Lema was in the top 5 for three tournaments. The table doesn't include individual player data but shows each tournament's \"top -5\" count. For the PGA Championship, this count is 0, meaning no one was in the top 5. Thus, the claim can't be true.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"top - 5\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"tournament that tony lema won in be pga championship.\" So, I need to determine if Tony Lema won the PGA Championship.\n\nFirst, looking at the table structure. The columns are tournament, wins, top-5, top-10, top-25, events, and cuts made. There are five rows of data: four tournaments (Masters Tournament, US Open, The Open Championship, PGA Championship) and a totals row.\n\nThe claim mentions Tony Lema winning the PGA Championship. Since the table doesn't include information about individual players like Tony Lema, but rather aggregate statistics for each tournament, I need to see if any of these rows indicate that someone won the PGA Championship. \n\nLooking at each tournament's \"wins\" column:\n- Masters Tournament: 0 wins\n- US Open: 0 wins\n- The Open Championship: 1 win\n- PGA Championship: 0 wins\n\nThe totals row shows 1 total win across all tournaments. So, the only tournament with a win is The Open Championship, which has 1 win.\n\nTherefore, according to the table, The Open Championship was the one with a win, not the PGA Championship. Since Tony Lema is associated with the PGA Championship in the claim, but there are no wins listed for that tournament, the claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells show that The Open Championship has 1 win, while PGA Championship has 0.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n- Check the \"wins\" column for each tournament.\n- Only The Open Championship has a value of 1 in the \"wins\" column.\n- SincePGA Championship shows 0 wins, Tony Lema couldn't have won it based on this table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"tony lema do not win in the pga championship\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the table structure, it has columns: tournament, wins, top-5, top-10, top-25, events, cuts made. The data rows are for different tournaments like masters tournament, us open, the open championship, pga championship, and totals.\n\nThe claim is about Tony Lema not winning in the PGA Championship. So I need to check if there's any mention of Tony Lema in this table. Wait, looking at the data, the rows under \"tournament\" are just the names like \"masters tournament\", \"us open\", etc., but there's no player name mentioned anywhere. The columns don't include player names either.\n\nThe claim mentions a specific person, Tony Lema, but the table doesn't have any information about individual players or their performance beyond aggregated data like wins, top finishes, events played, and cuts made for each tournament. Since the table only provides aggregate statistics per tournament and not per player, there's no way to verify whether Tony Lema won or didn't win in the PGA Championship.\n\nTherefore, based on the given data, we can't support or refute the claim about Tony Lema. But since the claim states that he did not win, and without any information indicating a win by him, it might lean towards true, but I'm not entirely sure because there's no data to confirm his participation or results.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the \"pga championship\" row, under \"wins\", it shows 0. That means in that tournament, there were zero wins recorded. So if Tony Lema participated and won, it would have shown a win, but since it's zero, maybe he didn't win. However, the table might be aggregating all players' wins across events or something else.\n\nBut without specific player data, I can't definitively say anything about Tony Lema. The claim could be true because there are no recorded wins in that tournament for any player, but since it's zero, maybe he didn't win. Alternatively, the table might not include his win if he did win and it's just not shown here.\n\nBut given the information, I think the best approach is to say TRUE because the pga championship row shows 0 wins, implying no one won there, including Tony Lema.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "tony lema make it to the top 10 in the us open , but do not continue on",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"tony lema make it to the top 10 in the us open, but do not continue on\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the table structure. The columns are: tournament, wins, top-5, top-10, top-25, events, cuts made. Each row represents a different tournament or totals.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n1. Masters Tournament\n2. US Open\n3. The Open Championship\n4. PGA Championship\n5. Totals\n\nThe claim mentions \"US Open,\" so I should focus on that row. In the US Open row, under the column \"top-10\" there's a value of 2.\n\nNow, interpreting the table: each number in these columns likely represents how many times Tony Lema achieved that position in the specified tournaments. So, for example, in the US Open, he made it to the top 10 twice (the 'top-10' column has 2). \n\nThe claim says he made it to the top 10 but didn't continue on. I'm not entirely sure what \"continue on\" means here, but perhaps it refers to whether he won any tournaments or continued beyond that point in his career. Looking at the 'wins' column for US Open, the value is 0. So he didn't win any US Opens.\n\nBut wait, does that mean he didn't continue? Maybe it implies that after reaching top 10, he didn't proceed further to win. Since he has 2 in top-10 and 0 wins, perhaps the claim is correct in saying he made it but didn't go on to win.\n\nHowever, another angle: if \"continue on\" means advancing beyond a certain stage in the tournament, maybe looking at 'cuts made' could help. The US Open row has 'cuts made' as 5. I'm not exactly sure what 'cuts made' signifies\u2014perhaps how many times he was cut from the event? Or how many cuts (like rounds) he made it through.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 'cuts made' refers to how many tournaments he participated in before being cut. But since the row is for US Open specifically, perhaps 'cuts made' isn't directly relevant here unless we're considering multiple events within the same tournament.\n\nBut focusing on the claim: he made top 10 (which aligns with the table) and did not continue on\u2014perhaps meaning he didn't win or advance beyond a certain point. Since in US Open, he has 2 top-10 finishes but no wins, it supports that part of the claim.\n\nSo relevant cells would be:\n- row for US Open (index 1)\n  - \"top-10\" column: value is 2 \u2192 supports he made it to top 10\n  - \"wins\" column: 0 \u2192 supports he didn't continue on (didn't win)\n\nTherefore, the claim seems TRUE based on these cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"top - 10\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
