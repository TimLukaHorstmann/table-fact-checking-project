    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's figure out whether the claim about Rhodesia is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"Rhodesia have 2 bronze medal, 5 silver medal, and 10 gold medal.\" \n\nFirst, I need to locate Rhodesia in the table. Looking at the data array, each entry represents a nation's performance. Let me go through them one by one:\n\n1. United States - rank 1\n2. Great Britain - rank 2\n3. Italy - rank 3\n4. Australia - rank 4\n5. Rhodesia - rank 5\n6. South Africa - rank 6\n7. Israel - rank 7\n8. Argentina - rank 8\n9. West Germany - rank 9\n10. Netherlands - rank 10\n\nSo, Rhodesia is in the fifth row (index 4 since it's zero-based). Now, let's check their medal counts. The columns are \"rank\", \"nation\", \"gold\", \"silver\", \"bronze\", \"total\". \n\nLooking at Rhodesia's row:\n- Gold: 10\n- Silver: 5\n- Bronze: 2\n\nThe claim states exactly these numbers: 10 gold, 5 silver, and 2 bronze. Each of these values matches perfectly with what's in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
