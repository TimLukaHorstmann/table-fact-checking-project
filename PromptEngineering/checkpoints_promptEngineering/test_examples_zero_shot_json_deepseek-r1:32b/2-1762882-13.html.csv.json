The claim is: \"during the 2003 - 04 scottish football season scotland score 0 point 3 time.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table to understand the data. The columns are date, venue, score, competition, and report. Each row represents a match with specific details.\n\nThe claim mentions that Scotland scored 0 points three times during the 2003-04 season. To verify this, I need to check each match's score where Scotland was involved as a home team (indicated by \"(h)\") or away (\"(a)\"). \n\nLooking through the data:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Date is \"20 august\", venue \"ullevaal stadium, oslo (a)\", score \"0 - 0\". Here, Scotland is the away team and scored 0 points. This counts as one instance.\n\n2. **Row 1**: Date \"6 september\", venue \"hampden park, glasgow (h)\", score \"3 - 1\". Scotland is home, so their score is 3. They didn't score 0 here.\n\n3. **Row 2**: Date \"10 september\", venue \"westfalenstadion, dortmund (a)\", score \"1 - 2\". Scotland is away and scored 1 point. Not a zero.\n\n4. **Row 3**: Date \"11 october\", venue \"hampden park, glasgow (h)\", score \"1 - 0\". Home team scores 1, so not zero.\n\n5. **Row 4**: Date \"15 november\", venue \"hampden park, glasgow (h)\", score \"1 - 0\". Again, Scotland scored 1 at home.\n\n6. **Row 5**: Date \"19 november\", venue \"amsterdam arena, amsterdam (a)\", score \"0 - 6\". Scotland is away and scored 0. This is the second instance.\n\n7. **Row 6**: Date \"31 march\", venue \"hampden park, glasgow (h)\", score \"1 - 2\". Home team scores 1; not zero.\n\n8. **Row 7**: Date \"28 april\", venue \"parken stadium, copenhagen (a)\", score \"0 - 1\". Scotland is away and scored 0. This is the third instance.\n\n9. **Rows 8 and 9** don't have a score of 0 for Scotland as home team.\n\nSo, in rows 0,5,7, Scotland scored 0 points three times.

Each row under \"data\" corresponds to a match with details filled in these columns.\n\nI need to check how many matches were played at Hampden Park, Glasgow during that season.\n\nLooking through each row:\n- Row 0: Venue is Ullevaal Stadium, Oslo.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"during the 2003 - 04 scottish football season scotland hold their competition to 0 point 4 time.\" \n\nI need to parse this. It seems like they're saying that in the 2003-04 season, Scotland held competitions where they scored 0 points four times.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like date, venue, score, competition type, and report source. The relevant columns for this claim are \"date\" (to check if it's within the 2003-04 season), \"score\" (to see if Scotland scored 0 points), and \"competition\".\n\nFirst, I should confirm whether all these matches occurred during the 2003-04 season. The dates in the table range from August 20 to May 30 of what seems like consecutive years\u2014probably 2003 and 2004. So it's reasonable to assume these are part of the 2003-04 season.\n\nNext, I need to find instances where Scotland scored 0 points. In football matches, a score line shows both teams' scores. The claim refers to \"0 point\", which could mean either a loss (0 goals scored) or perhaps a draw where they didn't win any points. However, in the context of competitions and points, a 0-0 draw would give both teams some points, depending on the competition rules.\n\nBut looking at the scores:\n\n1. August 20: 0 - 0 \u2192 Scotland (home?) drew, so probably got 1 point each.\n2. September 6: 3 - 1 \u2192 Scotland scored 3, opponent 1. So Scotland won, getting points.\n3. September 10: 1 - 2 \u2192 Scotland lost, but they scored 1 goal, not 0.\n4. October 11: 1 - 0 \u2192 Scotland won.\n5. November 15: 1 - 0 \u2192 Win again.\n6. November 19: 0 - 6 \u2192 Here, Scotland scored 0 goals, so this counts as a loss with 0 points.\n7. March 31: 1 - 2 \u2192 Loss but they scored 1 goal.\n8. April 28: 0 - 1 \u2192 Another loss where Scotland scored 0.\n9. May 27: 1 - 0 \u2192 Win.\n10. May 30: 4 - 1 \u2192 Win.\n\nWait, in row index 5 (November 19), the score is 0-6, so Scotland's score is 0. That's one instance of scoring 0 points. Then, looking at April 28 (row index 7), the score is 0-1, another instance where they scored 0.\n\nSo, I found two instances where Scotland scored 0 goals: rows 5 and 7. The claim says it happened four times. Are there any others?\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Row 0: 0-0 \u2192 Both teams got points.\n- Rows 2,3,4,6,8,9: All have non-zero scores for Scotland.\n\nSo only two instances where they scored 0 goals. Therefore, the claim of four times is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"0 point\". Perhaps it refers to when Scotland didn't win any points in a competition. In football competitions like leagues or ECQs, a loss gives you 0 points, while a draw gives 1 point and a win 3.\n\nLooking back at the scores:\n\n- Row 0: 0-0 \u2192 Draw, so 1 point each.\n- Row 5: 0-6 \u2192 Loss, 0 points.\n- Row 7: 0-1 \u2192 Loss, 0 points.\n\nSo in these two rows (indices 5 and 7), Scotland got 0 points. But the claim says four times. There are only two such instances.\n\nAdditionally, looking at competitions:\n\nRows 1,2,3,4,5: These are either ECQG5 or ECQPO, which might be qualifiers. Rows 0,6,7,8,9 are friendly matches.\n\nThe claim mentions \"their competition\", so perhaps it's referring to official competitions (ECQ) rather than friendlies. So in ECQG5 and ECQPO:\n\n- Row1: Scotland won 3-1 \u2192 3 points.\n- Row2: Lost 1-2 \u2192 0 points? Wait, no\u2014wait, the score is 1-2, so if Scotland was away, they lost but scored 1. So in terms of points, a loss gives 0. But in row2, it's (a) which means away. So yes, they got 0 points here.\nWait, I thought ECQG5 is competition type.\n\nSo let me re-examine:\n\nCompetition types are either 'friendly' or 'ecqg5', 'ecqpo'.\n\nIn the ECQ competitions, how many times did Scotland get 0 points?\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Row1: Competition ecqg5, score 3-1. Scotland won, so 3 points.\n- Row2: ecqg5, score 1-2 (away). Loss \u2192 0 points.\n- Row3: same competition, 1-0 home win? Wait no, row3 is at Westfalenstadion (a), meaning away. So score 1-2, loss, so 0 points.\nWait, row3's date is September 10, venue is away, score 1-2 \u2192 Scotland lost, scored 1 goal but got 0 points.\n\nSo in ECQG5 competitions:\n\nRow1: Win (3 points)\nRow2: Loss (0 points)\nRow3: Loss (0 points)\n\nSimilarly, row4 and row5 are ecqpo:\n\n- Row4: Home, score 1-0 \u2192 win, 3 points.\n- Row5: Away, 0-6 \u2192 loss, 0 points.\n\nSo in ECQ competitions, how many times did they get 0 points? Rows2,3,5: three instances.\n\nAdditionally, in friendly matches:\n\nRow0: Draw, so 1 point each.\nRows6,7,8,9: All wins or losses with non-zero goals except row7 (friendly loss 0-1).\n\nSo if the claim is about all competitions including friendlies, then rows5 (ECQPO loss), row2 (ecqg5 loss), row3 (ecqg5 loss), and row7 (friendly loss). That's four instances where they got 0 points.\n\nAh, maybe that's what the claim refers to. So perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me list all rows where Scotland scored 0 goals:\n\n- Row0: 0-0 \u2192 They didn't score 0; both scored 0.\nWait, no\u2014wait, in row0, it's a draw, but each team scored 0? No, wait, the scores are 0-0. So neither team scored, so both got 1 point.\n\nBut for scoring 0 goals: Yes, they did score 0. But in terms of points, they still got 1 point from the draw.\n\nIf we count all matches where Scotland failed to score (scored 0), that's row0,5,7.\n\nWait:\n\n- Row0: both teams scored 0.\n- Row5: Scotland 0.\n- Row7: Scotland 0.\n\nSo three instances of scoring 0 goals. But the claim says four times. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if \"0 point\" refers to getting zero points in a competition (i.e., losses), then:\n\nIn ECQG5 and ECQPO competitions:\n\n- Rows1: Win \u2192 3 points.\n- Row2: Loss \u2192 0 points.\n- Row3: Loss \u2192 0 points.\n- Row4: Win \u2192 3 points.\n- Row5: Loss \u2192 0 points.\n\nThat's three times in official competitions where they got 0 points. If we include friendly matches:\n\n- Row6: 1-2, loss but scored 1 goal \u2192 not 0 points.\n- Row7: 0-1, loss and 0 goals \u2192 0 points.\nSo that adds one more instance (row7), making four total.\n\nTherefore, in both official competitions and friendlies, Scotland had four instances where they lost with 0 points:\n\nRows2,3,5,7.\n\nThus, the claim is correct if considering all matches. But earlier I thought only two, but actually it's four.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Scotland failed to score in four of their matches during the 2003-04 season holds true when considering both official competitions and friendly games. Specifically:\n\n1. **Row5 (November 19)**: Scored 0 goals in a 0-6 loss against their opponent.\n2. **Row7 (April 28)**: Scored 0 goals in a 0-1 loss.\n\nAdditionally, considering all matches where Scotland received zero points (losses):\n\n1. **Row2 (September 10)**: Lost with a score of 1-2.\n2. **Row3 (October 11)**: Lost with a score of 1-2.\n3. **Row5 (November 19)**: Lost with a score of 0-6.\n4. **Row7 (April 28)**: Lost with a score of 0-1.\n\nThus, there are four instances where Scotland either scored zero goals or lost without winning any points, depending on the context of the claim.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is correct; Scotland failed to score in four matches during the season.",

Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"during the 2003 - 04 scottish football season scotland play at hampden park , glasgow 3 more time than they do ullevaal stadium , oslo\"\n\nFirst, I need to identify how many times Scotland played at Hampden Park and Ullevaal Stadium during the specified season.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. **Identifying Matches at Hampden Park:**\n   - Row index 1: Venue is \"hampden park, glasgow (h)\", score \"3-1\", competition \"ecqg5\".\n   - Row index 2: Not relevant as venue is different.\n   - Row index 3: Venue is \"hampden park, glasgow (h)\", score \"1-0\", competition \"ecqg5\".\n   - Row index 4: Venue is \"hampden park, glasgow (h)\", score \"1-0\", competition \"ecqpo\".\n   - Row index 7: Not relevant as venue is different.\n   - Row index 8: Not relevant.\n   - Row index 9: Venue is \"easter road, edinburgh (h)\", so not Hampden.\n\nWait, that's three matches at Hampden Park. Wait no:\n\nLooking again:\n- Row 1: Hampden\n- Row 3: Hampden\n- Row 4: Hampden\n\nSo that's three times.\n\n2. **Identifying Matches at Ullevaal Stadium:**\n   - Row index 0: Venue is \"ullevaal stadium, oslo (a)\", score \"0-0\", competition \"friendly\".\n\nOnly one match at Ullevaal Stadium.\n\nNow, the claim says Scotland played at Hampden Park three more times than at Ullevaal. So, if Ullevaal was once, then Hampden should be four times (1 + 3 = 4). But in the table, Hampden is listed three times and Ullevaal once. That means Hampden is two more times than Ullevaal, not three.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nHampden Park matches:\n- Row 1\n- Row 3\n- Row 4\n\nThat's three rows where the venue is Hampden Park, Glasgow (h).\n\nUllevaal Stadium match:\n- Only row 0: once.\n\nSo, the number of times at Hampden is 3, Ullevaal is 1. The difference is 2 (3 -1 = 2). The claim says Scotland played \"3 more times\" at Hampden than Ullevaal, which would require Hampden to be 4 matches if Ullevaal was once.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because they only played twice as many times at Hampden compared to Ullevaal, not three times more.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"during the 2003 - 04 scottish football season scotland score 4 point only 1 time.\" \n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It mentions that during a specific season, Scotland scored 4 points just once. So, I'm looking for games where Scotland's score was exactly 4 points and check how many times this happened in the table.\n\nLooking at the columns: date, venue, score, competition, report. The 'score' column shows the result of each match, with two numbers separated by a dash. I assume the first number is Scotland's score, and the second is the opponent's. \n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Score is 0-0 \u2192 0 points for Scotland.\n2. Row 1: 3-1 \u2192 3 points.\n3. Row 2: 1-2 \u2192 1 point.\n4. Row 3: 1-0 \u2192 1 point.\n5. Row 4: 1-0 \u2192 1 point.\n6. Row 5: 0-6 \u2192 0 points.\n7. Row 6: 1-2 \u2192 1 point.\n8.

The claim says, \"during the 2003 - scottish football season scotland play at amsterdam 2 time.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It's about Scotland playing in Amsterdam twice during their 2003 Scottish football season. So I need to check how many times Scotland played a match in Amsterdam according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like date, venue, score, competition, and report. The relevant columns here are \"date\", \"venue\", and \"competition\". \n\nI'll go through each row to find matches where the venue is in Amsterdam. Scanning the data:\n\n- Row 0: Venue is Ullevaal Stadium, Oslo (A). Not Amsterdam.\n- Row 1: Hampden Park, Glasgow (H). Home game, not Amsterdam.\n- Row 2: Westfalenstadion, Dortmund (A). Away in Germany, not Amsterdam.\n- Row 3: Hampden Park again. Still Scotland's home, not Amsterdam.\n- Row 4: Hampden Park once more. No change here.\n- Row 5: Amsterdam Arena, Amsterdam (A). This is an away game in Amsterdam. So that's one occurrence.\n- Row 6 to 9: All venues are either in Glasgow, Copenhagen, Tallinn, or Edinburgh. None in Amsterdam.\n\nSo, only row 5 mentions a match at Amsterdam Arena in Amsterdam. That's just once, not twice as the claim suggests. \n\nWait, did I miss any other rows? Let me double-check. Rows go from 0 to 9. No others have \"amsterdam\" in the venue column. So it's only one time.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Scotland played at Amsterdam twice is incorrect based on this data.

The claim states: \"during the 2003 - scottish football season glasgow hold their competition back 4 time.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim and understand what it's asserting. It seems that the claim is saying that in the 2003 Scottish football season, Glasgow hosted four competitions. \n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a match with details like date, venue, score, competition type, and report. The key information we need to extract are the dates (to confirm if they fall within the 2003 season), the venues (specifically those in Glasgow), and the number of times competitions were held there.\n\nI'll start by examining each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Date is \"20 august\", venue is Ullevaal Stadium in Oslo, which isn't Glasgow.\n2. **Row 1**: Date is \"6 september\", venue is Hampden Park, Glasgow (h), so this counts as a competition in Glasgow.\n3. **Row 2**: Date is \"10 september\", venue is Westfalenstadion in Dortmund, not Glasgow.\n4. **Row 3**: Date is \"11 october\", venue is Hampden Park, Glasgow (h) again, another competition here.\n5. **Row 4**: Date is \"15 november\", venue is Hampden Park, Glasgow (h), third instance.\n6. **Row 5**: Date is \"19 november\", venue is Amsterdam Arena in Amsterdam, not Glasgow.\n7. **Row 6**: Date is \"31 march\", venue is Hampden Park, Glasgow (h), fourth competition here.\n8. **Row 7**: Date is \"28 april\", venue is Parken Stadium in Copenhagen, not relevant.\n9. **Row 8**: Date is \"27 may\", venue is A Le Coq Arena in Tallinn, not relevant.\n10. **Row 9**: Date is \"30 may\", venue is Easter Road in Edinburgh, which is in Scotland but not Glasgow.\n\nNow, considering the dates: August to November are all within 2003 (assuming the season spans from March/April to October/November). However, row 6 has a date of \"31 march,\" which is early in the year. If the season is considered as starting around March, then this would be part of the same season.\n\nLooking at the venues in Glasgow, rows 1, 3, 4, and 6 all have Hampden Park in Glasgow as the venue. That's four competitions hosted in Glasgow during that period. \n\nThe claim mentions \"back 4 time,\" which I interpret as hosting four times. The relevant cells are those with the venue in Glasgow, so rows 1, 3, 4, and 6 under the 'venue' column.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim is TRUE because there are four instances where competitions were held in Glasgow during that season.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"during the 2003 - scottish football season scotland beat easter road 3 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. The claim states that in the 2003 Scottish football season, Scotland defeated Easter Road three times. So I need to check if there are any matches where Scotland played at Easter Road and won, and whether this happened three times during that season.\n\nLooking at the table provided, which seems to list various football matches involving Scotland, each row contains details like date, venue, score, competition type, and report source. The key columns I need to focus on are \"date\", \"venue\", \"score\", and perhaps \"competition\" since it might indicate if it's a friendly or part of a qualification.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Date is \"20 august\", venue is Ullevaal Stadium, Oslo (a), score 0-0, competition friendly, report bbc sport.\n   - This is an away game in August with no win for Scotland.\n\n2. **Row 1**: 6 September, Hampden Park, Glasgow (h), 3-1, ECQG5, BBC Sport.\n   - Home game against a team in ECQG5 competition; score is 3-1 win. But the venue isn't Easter Road.\n\n3. **Row 2**: 10 September, Westfalenstadion, Dortmund (a), 1-2, ECQG5.\n   - Away match in Germany, lost.\n\n4. **Row 3**: 11 October, Hampden Park again, same setup as row 1 but score 1-0 win. Still not Easter Road.\n\n5. **Row 4**: 15 November, Hampden Park (h), 1-0, ECQPO.\n   - Another home win at Hampden Park, not Easter Road.\n\n6. **Row 5**: 19 November, Amsterdam Arena, away game, lost 0-6 in ECQPO.\n\n7. **Row 6**: 31 March, Hampden Park (h), friendly match, score 1-2 loss.\n\n8. **Row 7**: 28 April, Parken Stadium, Copenhagen (a), friendly, lost 0-1.\n\n9. **Row 8**: 27 May, A Le Coq Arena, Tallinn (a), friendly, won 1-0.\n\n10. **Row 9**: 30 May, Easter Road, Edinburgh (h), score 4-1, friendly match, report by BBC Sport.\n    - This is the only entry where the venue is Easter Road, and it's a home game with a win of 4-1.\n\nNow, checking for any other entries related to Easter Road. Looking through all rows, only row 9 mentions Easter Road. The date is 30 May, which falls within the 2003 season if considering the football season runs typically from August to May. The competition is friendly, and Scotland won with a score of 4-1.\n\nThe claim says \"beat Easter Road 3 times.\" However, in this table, there's only one instance where they played at Easter Road and won. There are no other entries for Easter Road. Therefore, the claim that they beat Easter Road three times is not supported by the data provided; it only happened once.\n\nSo, based on the table, the relevant cell is row 9, column \"venue\" which shows the match at Easter Road with a win. Since there's only one such instance and the claim states three times, this makes the claim FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to three victories at Easter Road in the 2003 season. The table only shows one match at Easter Road where Scotland won.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"during the scottish football season scotland play easter road , edinburgh 5 time more than hampden park , glasgow.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should look at the venues mentioned in the table. Easter Road, Edinburgh and Hampden Park, Glasgow are both listed as venues in the \"venue\" column.\n\nI'll go through each row to count how many times each venue was used.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nRow 0: Venue is Ullevaal Stadium, Oslo (A) \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 1: Hampden Park, Glasgow (H) \u2013 that's one for Hampden.\nRow 2: Westfalenstadion, Dortmund (A) \u2013 irrelevant.\nRow 3: Hampden Park again \u2013 so that's two.\nRow 4: Hampden Park again \u2013 three times now.\nRow 5: Amsterdam Arena \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 6: Hampden Park once more \u2013 four times.\nRow 7: Parken Stadium \u2013 irrelevant.\nRow 8: A Le Coq Arena \u2013 irrelevant.\nRow 9: Easter Road, Edinburgh (H) \u2013 that's the only time for Easter Road.\n\nSo according to the table, Scotland played at Hampden Park four times and once at Easter Road. The claim says Easter Road was used five times more than Hampden, but actually, it's the opposite. They played more at Hampden Park. So the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are all the rows where venue is either Easter Road or Hampden Park. That includes rows 1,3,4,6 (Hampden) and row9 (Easter Road).\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
