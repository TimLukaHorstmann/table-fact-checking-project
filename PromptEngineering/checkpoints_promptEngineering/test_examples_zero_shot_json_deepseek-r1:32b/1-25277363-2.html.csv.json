    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a table in JSON format and a claim to verify: \"bob sand write episode 149\". My task is to determine whether this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim states that Bob Sand wrote Episode 149. So, I'm looking for information about Episode 149 and its writer(s).\n\nLooking at the table's structure, it has columns: \"no in series\", \"no in season\", \"title\", \"directed by\", \"written by\", and \"original air date\". Each row corresponds to an episode with specific details under these columns.\n\nEpisode numbers can be a bit confusing because there are two numbering systems here: \"no in series\" and \"no in season\". The claim refers to Episode 149, which I assume is the \"no in series\" number since that's more likely to be a unique identifier across seasons. Let me check the table for row where \"no in series\" is 149.\n\nLooking through the data:\n- Row 5 has [149, 5, \"fast friends\", \"john tracy\", \"bob sand\", \"october 12 , 1993\"]\n\nSo, Episode 149 (by series number) is titled \"fast friends\" and was written by Bob Sand. This matches the claim exactly.\n\nI should also consider if there are other episodes with the same title or writer that might be confused, but in this case, it's straightforward. The relevant cell for verification is row 5 under the \"written by\" column, which confirms Bob Sand as the writer.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"written by\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"tough love be the title of episode 148\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. The user is stating that the title of episode number 148 is \"tough love.\" My task is to check if this information aligns with the data given in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: \"no in series\", \"no in season\", \"title\", \"directed by\", \"written by\", and \"original air date\". The claim refers to an episode number, which I believe corresponds to either \"no in series\" or \"no in season.\" Since the claim mentions \"episode 148,\" it's likely referring to the \"no in series\" column because that's a higher number than the \"no in season\" which seems to go up only to 19.\n\nNow, I'll scan through each row of the table to find where \"no in series\" is 148. Let me list out the rows:\n\nRow 3: [148, 4, \"tough love\", ...]\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, looking back at the data array:\n\n- The first element is [145,...], which is row index 0.\n- Then each subsequent entry increases by one in the series number.\n\nSo, the rows go from 145 (index 0) up to 163 (index 18). Therefore, \"no in series\" 148 would be at row index 3 because:\n\nRow 0: 145\nRow 1: 146\nRow 2: 147\nRow 3: 148\n\nYes, that's correct. So, looking at row index 3, the \"title\" column should be checked.\n\nThe title in row 3 is listed as \"tough love.\" The claim says the same thing. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\n- The cell for \"no in series\" being 148 is at row index 3 under \"no in series.\"\n- The cell for the title being \"tough love\" is also at row index 3 under \"title.\"\n\nSo both these cells are relevant to verify the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"fast friend originally air on october 12, 1993\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it mentions a title \"fast friend\" and an original air date of October 12, 1993. My task is to check if both these pieces of information match in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are \"no in series\", \"no in season\", \"title\", \"directed by\", \"written by\", and \"original air date\". So I need to find a row where the title matches \"fast friend\" and then check if its original air date is October 12, 1993.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one. Let me start from the top:\n\nRow 0: Title is \"it was a dark and stormy night\" \u2013 not matching.\nRow 1: \"the apartment\" \u2013 nope.\nRow 2: \"wrong - way tanner\" \u2013 still not.\nRow 3: \"tough love\" \u2013 no match.\nRow 4: \"fast friends\" \u2013 wait, this is close. The title here is \"fast friends\". Hmm, the claim says \"fast friend\", which is singular. But in the table, it's plural: \"friends\". Is that a typo or is it correct? I need to consider whether \"fast friend\" could be a variation of \"fast friends\". Maybe it's just a minor difference, but for accuracy, I should check if there's another entry.\n\nContinuing down:\nRow 5: \"smash club : the next generation\" \u2013 nope.\nRow 6: \"high anxiety\" \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 7: \"another opening , another no show\" \u2013 no match.\nRow 8: \"the day of the rhino\" \u2013 doesn't fit.\nRow 9: \"the prying game\" \u2013 no.\nRow 10: \"the bicycle thief\" \u2013 nope.\nRow 11: \"support your local parents\" \u2013 not matching.\nRow 12: \"the perfect couple\" \u2013 no.\nRow 13: \"is it true about stephanie\" \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 14: \"the test\" \u2013 doesn't fit.\nRow 15: \"joey 's funny valentine\" \u2013 nope.\nRow 16: \"the last dance\" \u2013 not matching.\nRow 17: \"kissing cousins\" \u2013 no.\nRow 18: \"love on the rocks\" \u2013 doesn't match.\n\nSo, in row 4, I found a title that's similar but plural. The original air date for this row is October 12, 1993, which matches the claim. However, the titles don't exactly match: one says \"fast friends\" and the other \"fast friend\". If the claim had said \"fast friends\", it would definitely be true. But since it's singular, maybe that's a mistake.\n\nBut wait, sometimes people might refer to it in singular even if the official title is plural. So perhaps the claim is correct but just has a minor typo. Alternatively, there could be another row with the exact title \"fast friend\". Since I went through all rows and only found \"fast friends\" as a similar title, and that does have the correct air date, I think it's safe to consider the claim true, assuming the singular was an error.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cell is in row 4 under the \"original air date\" column. So the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. The claim states: \"fast friend originally air on october11  , 1992.\" So it's making a statement about an episode titled \"fast friend\" airing on October 11, 1992.\n\nLooking at the table, which seems to be a list of episodes with details like number in series, number in season, title, directed by, written by, and original air date. My task is to check if there's an episode named \"fast friend\" that aired on October 11, 1992.\n\nI'll start by searching through the titles in the table for \"fast friends.\" Scanning through each row under the 'title' column:\n\nRow 4 (index starting from 0): The title is \"fast friends,\" which looks similar to the claim's \"fast friend\" except for the plural 'friends.' I need to check if this is a typo or not. Maybe it's supposed to be singular, but in the table, it's plural.\n\nLooking at the original air date for this row: It says October 12, 1993. The claim mentions October 11, 1992, which is a different year and date.\n\nWait, that's a big discrepancy. The episode exists but aired in 1993, not 1992. Also, the title has an 's' at the end.\n\nSo, considering both points: the title doesn't exactly match (plural vs. singular) and the air date is off by a year and one day. Therefore, the claim isn't accurate based on the table data.\n\nHence, the answer should be FALSE, with relevant cells pointing to where I found the episode.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to an episode titled \"fast friend\" airing on October 11, 1992.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the episode number in the series the test be before 148.0\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that the episode titled \"The Test\" has a series number (I think it refers to \"no in series\") that comes before 148.0. So, if the series number for \"The Test\" is less than 148, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, FALSE.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents an episode with several columns: no in series, no in season, title, directed by, written by, and original air date. The relevant columns here are \"no in series\" and \"title\".\n\nI need to find the row where the title is \"The Test\". Scanning through the data:\n\n- Row 14 (index starting from 0? Let me check): Wait, looking at each entry:\n\nRow 0: Title \"it was a dark and stormy night\"\nRow 1: \"the apartment\"\nRow 2: \"wrong - way tanner\"\nRow 3: \"tough love\"\nRow 4: \"fast friends\"\nRow 5: \"smash club : the next generation\"\nRow 6: \"high anxiety\"\nRow 7: \"another opening , another no show\"\nRow 8: \"the day of the rhino\"\nRow 9: \"the prying game\"\nRow 10: \"the bicycle thief\"\nRow 11: \"support your local parents\"\nRow 12: \"the perfect couple\"\nRow 13: \"is it true about stephanie\"\nRow 14: \"the test\" - Yes, this is the one.\n\nSo row index 14 has the title \"The Test\". Now, looking at the \"no in series\" column for this row. The value there is 159. \n\nNow, I need to check if 159 comes before 148.0. Since 159 is greater than 148, it does not come before. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are the \"no in series\" value for \"The Test\", which is at row 14, column \"no in series\".\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"}\n   ]\n}",
