    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"malaysia airline work with 2 different company for catering : taj madras air catering limit and mas cater (sarawak) sdn bhd.\"\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions two companies involved in catering: Taj Madras Air Catering Limited and MAS Cater (Sarawak) SDN BHD. The question is whether Malaysia Airlines works with both of these for catering.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has several entries. I need to check each row to see if they relate to catering and are associated with Malaysia Airlines.\n\nLet's go through each relevant row:\n\n1. Row 0: Malaysia Airlines Cargo SDN BHD - type is subsidiary, activity is cargo. Not related to catering.\n2. Row 1: GE Engine Services Malaysia - joint venture, engine overhaul. Not catering.\n3. Row 2: MASWings SDN BHD - subsidiary, airline. Activity is airline operations, not directly catering.\n4. Row 3: Firefly SDN BHD - same as above.\n5. Row 4: MAS Aerotechnologies SDN BHD - MRO (Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul). Not catering.\n6. Row 5: MAS Golden Holidays SDN BHD - tour operator. Not directly catering for airlines.\n7. Row 6: Malaysian Aerospace Engineering SDN BHD - engineering. Not relevant here.\n8. Row 7: MAS Academy SDN BHD - flight school. Unrelated to catering.\n9. Row 8: Abacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia) SDN BHD - computer reservation system. Not catering.\n10. Row 9: Taj Madras Air Catering Limited - associate, activity is catering, incorporated in India, group's equity is 20%. This fits the first company mentioned in the claim.\n11. Row 10: MAS Catering (Sarawak) SDN BHD - subsidiary, catering, incorporated in Malaysia, 60% shareholding. This matches the second company mentioned.\n12. Row 11: LSG Sky Chefs - associate, holding company, equity 30%. Not directly involved in catering as per their activity listed.\n\nSo both companies mentioned in the claim are present in the table under the 'catering' activities. Taj Madras is an associate with 20% equity, and MAS Cater (Sarawak) is a subsidiary with 60%.\n\nTherefore, Malaysia Airlines does work with two different companies for catering as stated in the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says: \"Malaysia airline have 100% equity in 7 of their 9 different subsidiary.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. It's talking about Malaysia Airlines having a certain number of subsidiaries where they hold 100% equity. Specifically, it mentions that out of 9 subsidiaries, 7 have 100% equity.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see that the columns are \"company\", \"type\", \"principal activities\", \"incorporated in\", and \"group's equity shareholding\". The claim is about the equity shareholding for subsidiaries. So I should focus on rows where the \"type\" is \"subsidiary\" and check their \"group's equity shareholding\".\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd: type is subsidiary, equity 100%. This counts.\n2. Ge Engine Services Malaysia: joint venture, 30% equity. Not a subsidiary, so skip.\n3. Maswings Sdn Bhd: subsidiary, 100%. Counts.\n4. Firefly Sdn Bhd: subsidiary, 100%. Counts.\n5. MAS Aerotechnologies Sdn Bhd: subsidiary, 100%. Counts.\n6. MAS Golden Holidays Sdn Bhd: subsidiary, 100%. Counts.\n7. Malaysian Aerospace Engineering Sdn Bhd: subsidiary, 100%. Counts.\n8. MAS Academy Sdn Bhd: subsidiary, 100%. Counts.\n9. Abacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd: subsidiary, 80% equity. So this doesn't count as 100%.\n10. Taj Madras Air Catering Limited: associate, so not a subsidiary.\n11. MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd: subsidiary, 60%. Doesn't count for 100%.\n12. LSG Sky Chefs: associate, not a subsidiary.\n\nNow, let's list all the subsidiaries:\n\nRows with type \"subsidiary\":\n- Row 0\n- Row 2\n- Row 3\n- Row 4\n- Row 5\n- Row 6\n- Row 7\n- Row 8\n\nWait, that's 8 rows where the type is \"subsidiary\". But in the claim, it says there are 9 subsidiaries. Hmm, maybe I miscounted.\n\nLet me recount:\n\nLooking at each row:\nRow 0: subsidiary\nRow 1: joint venture \u2013 not a sub\nRow 2: sub\nRow 3: sub\nRow 4: sub\nRow 5: sub\nRow 6: sub\nRow 7: sub\nRow 8: sub (but equity is 80%, so doesn't count for 100%)\nRow 9: associate \u2013 nope\nRow 10: sub\nRow 11: associate \u2013 nope\n\nWait, so total subsidiaries are rows 0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10. That's 9 rows where type is \"subsidiary\".\n\nNow, among these 9, how many have 100% equity?\n\nLooking at each:\n\nRow 0: 100% \u2013 yes\nRow 2: 100%\nRow 3: 100%\nRow 4: 100%\nRow 5: 100%\nRow 6: 100%\nRow 7: 100%\nRow 8: 80% \u2013 no\nRow 10: 60% \u2013 no\n\nSo that's 7 subsidiaries with 100% equity. The other two are 80% and 60%.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct: out of their 9 subsidiaries, Malaysia Airlines has 100% equity in 7.\n\nI should note which cells I checked. For each row where type is \"subsidiary\", I looked at the \"group's equity shareholding\" column to determine if it was 100%. So relevant cells are rows 0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10 in the \"group's equity shareholding\" column.\n\nWait, but the user instruction says that each object should have row_index and column_name. Since all these rows are checked for their equity percentage, which is under the \"group's equity shareholding\" column, I can list each of them as relevant.\n\nBut wait, let me think again: maybe it's more efficient to include only those cells where the equity was 100%, but no, because the claim is about whether they have 7 out of 9. So I need to check all 9 subsidiaries' equity shareholding to confirm how many are at 100%.\n\nSo for each subsidiary (rows 0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10), we look at the equity.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are each of these rows in the \"group's equity shareholding\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Malaysia Airlines has 100% equity in 7 out of their 9 subsidiaries. The relevant cells include all rows where the company type is a subsidiary and the equity shareholding is checked.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "all of the subsidiary and associate of malaysia airline be incorporate in malaysia , except for taj madras air catering limit , which be incorporate in india",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"all of the subsidiary and associate of Malaysia Airline be incorporated in Malaysia, except for Taj Madras Air Catering Limit, which be incorporate in India.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being claimed here. It says that every subsidiary and associate company of Malaysia Airline is incorporated in Malaysia, with one exception: Taj Madras Air Catering Limited, which is incorporated in India.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different company along with details like type, principal activities, incorporation location, and equity shareholding. My task is to verify if all subsidiaries and associates except Taj Madras are indeed incorporated in Malaysia.\n\nLet me go through each entry in the data array:\n\n1. **Malaysia Airlines Cargo SDN BHD**: Type is subsidiary, incorporated in Malaysia. This fits the claim.\n2. **GE Engine Services Malaysia**: Joint venture, 30% share. Incorporated in Malaysia. Since it's a joint venture, not directly a subsidiary or associate of Malaysia Airline as per the claim, so I can note this but it doesn't impact the claim directly.\n3. **MASWings SDN BHD**: Subsidiary, incorporated in Malaysia. Fits the claim.\n4. **Firefly SDN BHD**: Subsidiary, incorporated in Malaysia. Also fits.\n5. **Mas Aerotechnologies SDN BHD**: Subsidiary, incorporated in Malaysia. Good.\n6. **MAS Golden Holidays SDN BHD**: Subsidiary, incorporated in Malaysia. Fine.\n7. **Malaysian Aerospace Engineering SDN BHD**: Subsidiary, incorporated in Malaysia. Okay.\n8. **Mas Academy SDN BHD**: Subsidiary, incorporated in Malaysia. Good.\n9. **Abacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia) SDN BHD**: Subsidiary, incorporated in Malaysia. Fits.\n10. **Taj Madras Air Catering Limited**: Associate, incorporated in India. This is the exception mentioned in the claim.\n11. **MAS Catering (Sarawak) SDN BHD**: Subsidiary, incorporated in Malaysia. Fits.\n12. **LSG Sky Chefs**: Associate, incorporated in Malaysia. Wait, this entry has \"incorporated in\" as Malaysia. So LSG Sky Chefs is an associate company but incorporated in Malaysia.\n\nNow, the claim says that all subsidiaries and associates are in Malaysia except Taj Madras. Let me check if any other associate besides Taj Madras is incorporated elsewhere. From the table:\n\n- The only associate companies listed are Taj Madras (India) and LSG Sky Chefs (Malaysia). So, apart from Taj Madras, all other associates are indeed in Malaysia.\n\nAlso, checking all subsidiary entries, they are all incorporated in Malaysia except none\u2014so that part of the claim is true. \n\nWait a moment, I just noticed that row 12 says \"LSG Sky Chefs\" is an associate and incorporated in Malaysia. So, that's correct as per the claim. But what about other associates? There are only two associate entries: Taj Madras (India) and LSG Sky Chefs (Malaysia). \n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- All subsidiaries: all in Malaysia.\n- Associates: one in India (Taj Madras), others (if any) should be in Malaysia. In this case, the other associate is indeed in Malaysia.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true because every subsidiary and associate except Taj Madras is incorporated in Malaysia. So, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells are those that show the incorporation location for each company, specifically looking at \"incorporated in\" column. For each row where type is 'subsidiary' or 'associate', we check their incorporation country. All subsidiaries except none are in Malaysia, and all associates except Taj Madras are in Malaysia.\n\nNow, to list the relevant cells:\n\n- Rows 0 to 11, checking the \"incorporated in\" column for each.\nBut to be precise, since the claim is about subsidiaries and associates, I can focus on those rows where type is 'subsidiary' or 'associate'.\n\nSo, row indices 0 (subsidiary), 2-8 (subsidiaries), 10 (subsidiary), 9 (associate - Taj Madras in India), 12 (associate - LSG Sky Chefs in Malaysia).\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\n[\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"}\n]\n\nBut wait, row indices start from 0. The data has 12 entries (indices 0 to 11). Row 12 would be beyond the array length. Let me double-check:\n\nThe rows are from 0 to 11 because there are 12 entries as per the list above.\n\nSo adjusting, for associates: row 9 is Taj Madras (associate), and row 12 doesn't exist. Wait, that's a mistake in counting earlier.\n\nLooking back at the initial data, let me recount:\n\nThe rows are 0 to 11 (total 12). So in my earlier analysis, LSG Sky Chefs was row 12? No, no\u2014wait: the list of companies from the user is as follows:\n\n0. You are tasked... [the problem statement]\nThen the assistant's response starts.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm confusing with the count. The data given by the user has rows from index 0 (subsidiary) up to index 11 (LSG Sky Chefs). Let me recount:\n\nRows 0: subsidiary\nRow1: joint venture\nRow2: subsidiary\nRow3: subsidiary\nRow4: subsidiary\nRow5: subsidiary\nRow6: subsidiary\nRow7: subsidiary\nRow8: subsidiary\nRow9: associate\nRow10: subsidiary\nRow11: associate\n\nSo, row indices 0-11. So LSG Sky Chefs is at index 11.\n\nTherefore, the relevant rows for type 'subsidiary' or 'associate' are:\n\nSubsidiaries:\n0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10\n\nAssociates:\n9,11\n\nThus, their \"incorporated in\" cells should be checked. So all these rows have \"incorporated in\" as Malaysia except row 9 (Taj Madras), which is India.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n{\n  \"row_0_incorporated_in\": Malaysia,\n  \"row_2_incorporated_in\": Malaysia,\n  ...\n  \"row_10_incorporated_in\": Malaysia,\n  \"row_9_incorporated_in\": India,\n  \"row_11_incorporated_in\": Malaysia\n}\n\nSo, in the JSON format for the answer, I need to list each of these row indices and their \"incorporated in\" column.\n\nThus, compiling all relevant cells:\n\nFor subsidiaries (rows 0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10):\n\nEach has incorporated_in: Malaysia\n\nAssociates (rows9,11):\n\nrow9: India\nrow11: Malaysia\n\nSo, these are the key cells that confirm the claim is true.\n\nHence, the answer is TRUE and the relevant cells are as listed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if all subsidiaries and associates of the company are incorporated in Malaysia except for Taj Madras Air Catering Limited, which is incorporated in India, we examined each relevant row:\n\n- **Subsidiaries (Rows 0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10)**: All have \"incorporated in\" as Malaysia.\n- **Associates (Rows9,11)**: Row9 is incorporated in India, and Row11 is incorporated in Malaysia.\n\nThus, the claim holds true.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe statement is TRUE. All subsidiaries and associates are incorporated in Malaysia except for Taj Madras Air Catering Limited, which is incorporated in India.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I'll read and understand the table structure. The columns are: company, type, principal activities, incorporated in, group's equity shareholding. There are 12 rows of data representing different companies related to Malaysia Airlines.\n\nThe claim states: \"Of all the subsidiary of malaysia airline malaysia airline have the lowest equity shareholding in ma catering (sarawak) sdn bhd.\" I need to break this down.\n\nFirst, identify all subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines. Looking at the 'type' column:\n\n- Rows 0: subsidiary\n- Row 2: subsidiary\n- Row 3: subsidiary\n- Row 4: subsidiary\n- Row 5: subsidiary\n- Row 6: subsidiary\n- Row 7: subsidiary\n- Row 8: subsidiary\n\nSo, rows 0 to 8 are subsidiaries. \n\nNext, check the equity shareholding for each of these subsidiaries:\n\nRow 0: 100%\nRow 2: 100%\nRow 3: 100%\nRow 4: 100%\nRow 5: 100%\nRow 6: 100%\nRow 7: 100%\nRow 8: 80%\n\nSo, the equity shareholdings are mostly 100%, except for row 8 which is 80%.\n\nNow, looking at \"ma catering (sarawak) sdn bhd\" which is in row 9. Its type is 'subsidiary', but wait no\u2014row 9's type is 'associate', not a subsidiary. Wait, the claim says it's a subsidiary of Malaysia Airlines. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the claim says \"of all the subsidiary of malaysia airline malaysia airline have the lowest equity shareholding in ma catering (sarawak) sdn bhd.\" But looking at row 9: company is 'taj madras air catering limited', type 'associate'. Row 10: 'mas catering (sarawak) sdn bhd' with type 'subsidiary'.\n\nAh, I see. So the correct row for 'ma catering (sarawak)' is row 10. Its equity shareholding is 60%.\n\nNow, comparing all subsidiaries:\n\nRows 0-8: mostly 100%, except row 8 has 80%. Row 10: 60%. \n\nSo among all subsidiaries, the equity shareholdings are at their lowest in row 10 with 60%. However, in the list of subsidiaries (rows 0 to 9), 'mas catering (sarawak)' is a subsidiary and has 60% equity. The other subsidiaries have higher or equal percentages.\n\nWait, but looking back: rows 0-8 are the first nine entries, with row 8 being 80%. Then rows 9 and 10 are also part of the table, but only rows with type 'subsidiary' should be considered.\n\nSo, among all subsidiaries (rows where type is 'subsidiary'), which includes rows 0-8 and row 10. Their equity shareholdings are:\n\nRow 0: 100%\nRow 2: 100%\nRow 3: 100%\nRow 4: 100%\nRow 5: 100%\nRow 6: 100%\nRow 7: 100%\nRow 8: 80%\nRow 10: 60%\n\nSo the lowest is 60% in row 10. Therefore, Malaysia Airlines has a 60% shareholding in 'mas catering (sarawak) sdn bhd', which is indeed the lowest among all subsidiaries.\n\nWait, but I need to ensure that this is correct. Let me list out all the equity percentages for each subsidiary:\n\n- malaysia airlines cargo: 100%\n- maswings: 100%\n- firefly: 100%\n- mas aerotechnologies: 100%\n- mas golden holidays: 100%\n- malaysian aerospace engineering: 100%\n- mas academy: 100%\n- abacus distribution systems (malaysia): 80%\n- mas catering (sarawak): 60%\n\nSo yes, the lowest is 60% in row 10. Therefore, the claim that Malaysia Airlines has the lowest equity shareholding in 'ma catering (sarawak)' is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells are:\n\nFor all subsidiaries, we need to check their equity shareholdings and compare with mas catering's.\n\nSo relevant rows would be:\n\nRow 0: equity 100%\nRow 2: 100%\nRow 3: 100%\nRow 4: 100%\nRow 5: 100%\nRow 6: 100%\nRow 7: 100%\nRow 8: 80%\nRow 10: 60%\n\nSo the relevant cells are all these rows under 'group's equity shareholding' column.\n\nThus, the answer is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Wait, checking the JSON structure:\n\nThe data array has elements starting at index 0:\n0: malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd\n1: ge engine services malaysia\n2: maswings...\nSo row indices are correct.\n\nLooking at row 1 (ge engine...):\n- \"incorporated in\" is Malaysia.\n- \"group's equity shareholding\" is 30%.\n\nSo, yes, they have a 30% share. Also, the type is \"joint venture\", not \"subsidiary\". So it's correct that GE Engine Services isn't a subsidiary.\n\nNext, checking LSG Sky Chefs:\n- Found in row 11 (index 10 if data starts at 0? Wait, let me recount:\n\nLooking at the data array indices from 0 to 11 (since there are 12 rows):\n\nRow 0: malaysia airlines cargo...\nRow 1: ge engine...\nRow 2: maswings...\nRow 3: firefly...\nRow 4: mas aerotech...\nRow 5: mas golden holidays...\nRow 6: malaysian aerospace...\nRow 7: mas academy...\nRow 8: abacus distribution...\nRow 9: taj madras air catering (India)\nRow 10: mas catering sarawak\nRow 11: lsg sky chefs\n\nSo row index 11 is for LSG Sky Chefs.\n\nLooking at that row:\n- \"type\" is \"associate\", so not a subsidiary.\n- Equity shareholding is 30%.\n\nTherefore, the claim states both companies have 30% and are not subsidiaries. \n\nBoth points check out: correct equity percentage and both types are either joint venture or associate, meaning neither is a subsidiary.\n\nSo, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that Malaysia Airlines holds a 30% stake in both LSG Sky Chef and GE Engine Services Malaysia, which are not subsidiaries. Checking each company:\n\n- **GE Engine Services Malaysia** (row 1): 30% shareholding, type is \"joint venture\".\n- **LSG Sky Chefs** (row 11): 30% shareholding, type is \"associate\".\n\nBoth companies have the correct equity percentage and are not subsidiaries. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"all of the subsidiary and associate of malaysia airline be incorporate in india except taj madras air catering limit, which be not from india.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this. It seems to say that all subsidiaries and associates of Malaysia Airline are incorporated in India except for Taj Madras Air Catering Limited, which is not from India.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll examine each row where \"type\" is either \"subsidiary\" or \"associate\". \n\nStarting with the first row: malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd is a subsidiary, incorporated in Malaysia. So that's already a problem because according to the claim, all subsidiaries should be in India except Taj Madras.\n\nNext, ge engine services malaysia is a joint venture, so it doesn't fall under subsidiary or associate as per the claim. Then maswings, firefly, mas aerotechnologies, mas golden holidays, malaysian aerospace engineering, and mas academy are all subsidiaries incorporated in Malaysia, not India. \n\nLooking at associates: Taj Madras Air Catering is listed as an associate, incorporated in India with a 20% shareholding. Wait, but the claim says Taj Madras is not from India. That contradicts because according to the table, it's incorporated in India. Additionally, there's another associate called lsg sky chefs incorporated in Malaysia.\n\nWait, so the claim says that all subsidiaries and associates except Taj Madras are incorporated in India. But in reality:\n\n- All subsidiaries except those listed have \"incorporated in\" as Malaysia.\n- Associates: Taj Madras is in India (so it should be the exception), but lsg sky chefs is an associate incorporated in Malaysia, which would mean that according to the claim, this should not exist because all except Taj Madras should be in India. But since lsg sky chefs is also an associate not from India, the claim isn't accurate.\n\nMoreover, the claim says that \"all subsidiary and associate... incorporate in india except taj madras...\" but actually:\n\n- Subsidiaries: All are incorporated in Malaysia.\n- Associates: Taj Madras (India) and lsg sky chefs (Malaysia). So the claim is incorrect because besides Taj Madras, there's another associate not from India.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because not all subsidiaries and associates except Taj Madras are in India; most are in Malaysia. Additionally, the statement about Taj Madras being \"not from India\" is incorrect as it is incorporated in India.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because several subsidiaries and associates of Malaysia Airline are incorporated in Malaysia, not India. The exception, Taj Madras Air Catering Limited, is actually incorporated in India, contradicting the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n     {\"row_8\", \"incorporated in\"},\n     {\"row_9\", \"incorporated in\"},\n     {\"row_10\", \"incorporated in\"},\n     {\"row_11\", \"incorporated in\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"malaysia airline have 100% equity in each of their subsidy , like taj madras air catering limit\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the table and understand what it contains. The table has several columns: company, type, principal activities, incorporated in, and group's equity shareholding. There are 12 rows of data.\n\nThe claim mentions two points:\n1. Malaysia airline holds 100% equity in each of their subsidiaries.\n2. An example given is Taj Madras Air Catering Limited.\n\nI need to verify both parts against the table.\n\nLooking at the \"type\" column, subsidiaries are listed where the type is \"subsidiary\". The group's equity shareholding for these should be 100% if the claim holds true. However, I also notice that there are joint ventures and associates in the table.\n\nNow, checking each row:\n- Rows 0: 100%\n- Row 1: 30% (joint venture)\n- Rows 2,3,4,5,6,7: all 100%\n- Row8: 80%\n- Row9: 20% (associate)\n- Row10: 60%\n- Row11: 30% (associate)\n\nWait a minute. The first point says \"each of their subsidy\", so only looking at rows where type is subsidiary.\n\nSo, for subsidiaries:\nRows 0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10 have type as subsidiary or associate? Wait no: Rows with type 'subsidiary' are rows 0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10. Let me list them:\n\nRow 0: Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd - subsidiary - 100%\nRow1 is joint venture\nRow2: maswings - subsidiary -100%\nRow3: firefly - subsidiary -100%\nRow4: mas aerotechnologies - subsidiary -100%\nRow5: mas golden holidays - subsidiary -100%\nRow6: malaysian aerospace engineering - subsidiary -100%\nRow7: mas academy - subsidiary -100%\nRow8: abacus distribution systems (malaysia) sdn bhd - subsidiary -80% \nWait, that's 80%, not 100%. So this is a problem for the claim.\n\nRow9: Taj Madras Air Catering Limited is an associate with 20% equity. But in the example given in the claim, it refers to Taj Madras as if it were a subsidiary where Malaysia has 100% equity. However, according to the table, it's an associate with only 20%. So this part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nAlso, looking at all subsidiaries:\n- Row8 (abacus) has 80%, not 100%.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Malaysia airline holds 100% equity in each of their subsidiaries is false because there's at least one subsidiary (abacus) where they have only 80%. Additionally, Taj Madras isn't a subsidiary but an associate with 20% shareholding.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\":9, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"malaysia airline have equal equity in each subsidy\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim means. It says that Malaysia Airlines has an equal equity share in each of their subsidiaries. So, for every subsidiary listed in the table, Malaysia Airlines should own exactly the same percentage.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see columns like \"company,\" \"type,\" \"principal activities,\" \"incorporated in,\" and \"group's equity shareholding.\" The last column is crucial here because it shows the equity share.\n\nI'll go through each row to check the equity share:\n\n1. Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd: 100%\n2. Ge Engine Services Malaysia: It's a joint venture with 30%, so not a subsidiary.\n3. Maswings Sdn Bhd: 100%\n4. Firefly Sdn Bhd: 100%\n5. MAS Aerotechnologies Sdn Bhd: 100%\n6. MAS Golden Holidays Sdn Bhd: 100%\n7. Malaysian Aerospace Engineering Sdn Bhd: 100%\n8. MAS Academy Sdn Bhd: 100%\n9. Abacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd: 80% \u2013 Wait, this is different.\n10. Taj Madras Air Catering Limited: Associate with 20%, not relevant as it's not a subsidiary.\n11. MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd: Subsidiary with 60% equity.\n12. LSG Sky Chefs: Associate, so not applicable.\n\nSo, among the subsidiaries, most have 100% equity except Abacus Distribution Systems at 80% and MAS Catering (Sarawak) at 60%. This shows that the equity isn't equal across all subsidiaries.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the claim and check against the table. The claim is: \"malaysia airline work with all subsidiary for cater except taj madras air catering limit\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this means. It seems that Malaysia Airlines works with all their subsidiaries in the catering sector except for Taj Madras Air Catering Limited.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll focus on rows where \"principal activities\" are related to catering. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. The first entry is \"malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd\", a subsidiary involved in cargo. Not relevant for catering.\n2. Next is \"ge engine services malaysia\", a joint venture for engine overhaul. Again, not catering.\n3. \"maswings sdn bhd\" and \"firefly sdn bhd\" are both subsidiaries but their activities are airline operations, so no.\n4. \"mas aerotechnologies sdn bhd\" does maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO), which isn't directly catering.\n5. \"mas golden holidays sdn bhd\" is a tour operator\u2014also not catering.\n6. \"malaysian aerospace engineering sdn bhd\" handles engineering, so no.\n7. \"mas academy sdn bhd\" is a flight school\u2014not relevant here.\n8. \"abacus distribution systems...\" is about computer reservation systems, which isn't catering.\n9. Now, looking at \"taj madras air catering limited\", it's an associate company in India with 20% equity shareholding and principal activity as catering. This seems to be the exception mentioned in the claim.\n10. Then there's \"mas catering (sarawak) sdn bhd\", a subsidiary engaged in catering with 60% equity.\n11. Finally, \"lsg sky chefs\" is an associate company involved in holding and has a 30% shareholding.\n\nSo, Malaysia Airlines works with subsidiaries like \"mas catering (sarawak)\" but not with the associate \"taj madras air catering\". Wait, but the claim says they work with all subsidiaries except Taj Madras. But looking at \"lsg sky chefs\", it's an associate, so perhaps it's included in their operations.\n\nWait a minute, does \"lsg sky chefs\" fall under the same category as \"taj madras\"? The claim specifies catering, and both are involved in that. However, \"taj madras\" is located in India, while others are in Malaysia except for \"lsg sky chefs\", which is also in Malaysia but as an associate.\n\nBut wait, looking back, \"lsg sky chefs\" has a principal activity of holding company, not catering directly. So maybe the only direct catering associates are \"taj madras\" and \"mas catering sarawak\". Since \"mas catering sarawak\" is a subsidiary with 60% shareholding, it's likely they work together, while \"taj madras\" being an associate at 20% might not be fully integrated.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Malaysia Airlines works with all subsidiaries except Taj Madras holds true because \"taj madras\" is an associate, not a subsidiary. All other catering-related companies are either subsidiaries or part of their network without exception beyond Taj Madras.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
