The columns are: track, recorded, original issue, song title, and time. Each row in the data corresponds to a specific track with its details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"track 23\" having a title \"just a little bit.\" I'll look at the last entry in the data array since there are 23 tracks listed (from 1 to 23). \n\nLooking at track number 23, which is row index 22 because indexing starts from 0. The song title for track 23 is \"he'll have to go.\" \n\nThe claim states that the title is \"just a little bit,\" but according to the table, it's actually \"he'll have to go.\" Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nTo verify, I'll check each relevant cell. The row index for track 23 is 22, and the column name for song titles is \"song title.\" So, the relevant cells are {row_22, song title}.\n\nSince the song title doesn't match the claim, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 22,\n       \"column_name\": \"song title\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"the song title for track 9 be just a little bit\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: track, recorded, original issue, song title, and time. Each row corresponds to a specific track with its details.\n\nThe claim specifies track number 9. So I need to find the row where the 'track' column is 9. Scanning through the data array:\n\nLooking at each sub-array (row), the first element is the track number. Let's go one by one until we reach track 9.\n\nRow indices start from 0, so let me count them:\n- Row 0: Track 1\n- Row 1: Track 2\n- Row 2: Track 3\n- Row 3: Track 4\n- Row 4: Track 5\n- Row 5: Track 6\n- Row 6: Track 7\n- Row 7: Track 8\n- Row 8: Track 9\n\nSo, row index 8 corresponds to track 9. Now, in that row, I need to check the 'song title' column.\n\nThe columns are ordered as [\"track\", \"recorded\", \"original issue\", \"song title\", \"time\"]. So, the fourth element (index 3) is the song title for each row.\n\nLooking at row 8: [9, \"7 / 22 / 73\", \"raised on rock\", \"just a little bit\", \"2:31\"]\n\nThe song title here is indeed \"just a little bit\". \n\nTherefore, the claim is correct. The relevant cell is in row index 8 under the 'song title' column.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 8,\n       \"column_name\": \"song title\"\n     }\n   ]\n}",
