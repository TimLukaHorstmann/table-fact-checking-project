    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. I'll need to carefully check each part of the claim against the data provided in the table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"beach break live / cone timentrate design be invest in by peter jones with more than 35000 request.\" It seems a bit unclear, but I think it's saying that both \"Beach Break Live\" and \"Cone Timentrate Design\" were invested in by Peter Jones, each requesting more than \u00a335,000.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll need to find the relevant entries for these two companies. The columns to focus on are \"company or product name\", \"money requested\", and \"investing dragon(s)\".\n\nStarting with \"Beach Break Live\":\n- Scanning through the rows, I see that Episode 1 has an entry with \"beach break live\" as the company/product.\n- The money requested here is \u00a350,000, which is more than \u00a335,000.\n- The investing dragon is Peter Jones.\n\nNext, checking for \"Cone Timentrate Design\":\n- I'll go through each row to see if this name appears. Looking at the data provided, there's an entry in Episode 3 where the company/product is \"concentrate design\" and another in Episode 9 mentioning \"red button design.\" Neither of these matches \"cone timentrate design.\"\n- Therefore, it seems that \"cone timentrate design\" isn't present in the table. It might be a typo or perhaps a different name.\n\nSince one part of the claim is correct (Peter Jones invested \u00a350,000 in Beach Break Live) but the other part about Cone Timentrate Design isn't supported by the data, the entire claim isn't fully accurate. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim partially holds true for \"Beach Break Live\" but not for \"Cone Timentrate Design,\" which doesn't exist in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"company or product name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"money requested\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"investing dragon(s)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"in episode 7, 145000 be the highest amount of money request by jerry mantalvanos & paul merker.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to locate Episode 7 in the table. Looking at the data, Episode 7 appears twice. The rows for Episode 7 are row indexes 10 and 11. \n\nLooking at Row 10: It's about Sammy French with \"fit fur life\" requesting \u00a3100,000.\nRow 11 is Jerry Mantalvanos & Paul Merker with \"jpm eco logistics\" asking for \u00a3100,000 as well.\n\nThe claim mentions that the highest amount requested in Episode 7 was \u00a3145,000 by Jerry and Paul. But from what I see, both entries in Episode 7 only have a money requested amount of \u00a3100,000 each. There's no mention of \u00a3145,000 in Episode 7.\n\nWait, let me double-check the other episodes to make sure I'm not missing something. In Episode 6, there are two entries: one by Ian Helmore for \"steri spray\" requesting \u00a3145,000 and another by Mark and Eleanor Davis for \"caribbean ready meals\" asking for \u00a3100,000. So the \u00a3145,000 is in Episode 6, not Episode 7.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Jerry and Paul requested \u00a3145,000 in Episode 7 is incorrect because they only asked for \u00a3100,000 there. Additionally, \u00a3145,000 isn't even present in Episode 7; it's from a different episode.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in Episode 7, Jerry Mantalvanos & Paul Merker requested \u00a3145,000, which is the highest amount for that episode. However, checking Episode 7, both entries only request \u00a3100,000 each. The \u00a3145,000 was actually requested in Episode 6 by Ian Helmore. Thus, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"money requested\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim. The key elements are:\n\n1. The company/product name: \"reestore\"\n2. The money requested: 70000\n3. The investing dragons: Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis\n\nI'll go through the table data to find where \"reestore\" appears. Scanning the \"company or product name\" column, I see that in row index 4 (since counting starts at 0), the company is \"reestore\". \n\nNow, checking the details for this row:\n\n- Episode: episode 4\n- First aired: 5 november 2007\n- Entrepreneurs: max mcmurdo\n- Money requested: 50000 (which is $50,000)\n- Investing dragons: Deborah meaden & theo paphitis\n\nWait a minute. The claim says \"reestore request 70000\", but according to this row, the money requested was 50000, not 70000. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nAlso, the investing dragons part matches: Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis are indeed listed as investors for \"reestore\". However, since the amount doesn't match, the claim isn't fully accurate.\n\nSo, the company is correct, the investors are correct, but the money requested was 50k, not 70k. Therefore, the entire claim isn't true because it's incorrect about the amount.\n\nI should note which cells I checked to support this conclusion. The relevant columns are \"company or product name\", \"money requested\", and \"investing dragon(s)\". The row index is 4 for all these checks.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions \"reestore\" requesting 70,000 from Deborah Meaden & Theo Paphitis. Looking at the table, \"reestore\" by Max McMurdo in episode 4 requested 50,000 and was funded by Deborah Meaden & Theo Paphitis. The amount requested does not match.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"company or product name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"money requested\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"investing dragon (s)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"game alert ask for the least amount of money\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions \"game alert,\" which likely refers to a specific company or product name in the table. So, I'll look through the \"company or product name\" column to find if there's an entry for \"gaming alerts.\"\n\nLooking at the data, row index 3 (since indexing starts at 0) has the company/product name \"gaming alerts.\" This is relevant because it matches part of the claim.\n\nNext, I need to check how much money they requested. In that same row, under \"money requested,\" the value is 200000. Now, to determine if this is the least amount requested in the entire table, I should compare it with all other entries.\n\nLooking through each row:\n- Episode 1: 50000 and 60000\n- Episode 2: 35000 and 200000 (which is gaming alerts)\n- Episode 3: 100000\n- Episode 4: 50000 and 100000\n- Episode 5: 100000\n- Episode 6: 145000 and 100000\n- Episode 7: 100000 twice\n- Episode 8: 150000\n- Episode 9: 50000\n\nThe smallest amount requested is 35000 in episode 2 by Sarah Lu for Youdoodoll. Therefore, \"gaming alerts\" requested 200000, which isn't the least; it's actually one of the higher amounts.\n\nSince gaming alerts didn't ask for the least money and another company did, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"game alert\" asked for the least amount of money.
