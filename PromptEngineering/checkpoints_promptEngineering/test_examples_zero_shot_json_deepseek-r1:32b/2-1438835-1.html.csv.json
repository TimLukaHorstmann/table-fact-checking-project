    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully: \n\nThe claim states that \"when the home score is 0-1 in the 2001-02 UEFA Cup, the club is St Gallen. Also, when the away score is 0-1 in the same competition and season, the club is Feyenoord.\"\n\nSo, I need to check two specific conditions in the table:\n\n1. For the home score of 0-1 in the 2001-02 UEFA Cup, does the club correspond to St Gallen?\n2. For the away score of 0-1 in the same season and competition, does the club correspond to Feyenoord?\n\nI'll start by looking at the table data provided.\n\nLooking at the columns: \"season\", \"competition\", \"round\", \"club\", \"home\", \"away\".\n\nI need to focus on rows where:\n- Season is \"2001 - 02\"\n- Competition is \"uefa cup\"\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\nRow 1 (index 0):\n- Season: 1995-96 \u2192 Not relevant.\n\nRow 2 (index 1):\n- Season: 2001-02, Competition: uefa cup.\n- Club: Matador Pa\u010dov\n- Home score: 2-1, Away score: 0-0 \u2192 Doesn't match either condition.\n\nRow 3 (index 2):\n- Season: 2001-02, Competition: uefa cup.\n- Club: St Gallen\n- Home score: 0-1, Away score: 4-1 \u2192 This matches the first part of the claim. Here, home score is 0-1 and club is St Gallen.\n\nRow 4 (index 3):\n- Season: 2001-02, Competition: uefa cup.\n- Club: Feyenoord\n- Home score: 2-2, Away score: 0-1 \u2192 This matches the second part of the claim. Here, away score is 0-1 and club is Feyenoord.\n\nRows 5 to 6 (indices 4-6) are from 2013-14 season, so they don't apply here.\n\nSo both conditions in the claim are satisfied:\n\n1. Home score 0-1 \u2192 St Gallen.\n2. Away score 0-1 \u2192 Feyenoord.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells from the table that support this conclusion.\n\nFor the first condition (home score 0-1):\n- The row index is 2.\n- Column names are \"club\" and \"home\".\n\nFor the second condition (away score 0-1):\n- The row index is 3.\n- Column names are \"club\" and \"away\".\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"club\"}\n- {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home\"}\n- {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"club\"}\n- {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away\"}\n\nThis covers both conditions and their respective rows.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"club\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"club\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away\" }\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"sc freiburg play in the uefa europe league competition 3 times in 2013-14 all in the group h round against club sevilla, estoril, and slovan liberec.\"\n\nFirst, I'll check if there's any mention of SC Freiburg in the table. Looking through each row:\n\nRow 0: Club is Slavia Prague.\nRow 1: Matador Pachov.\nRow 2: St Gallen.\nRow 3: Feyenoord.\nRows 4-6: Sevilla, Estoril, and Slovan Liberec.\n\nSo, none of the rows mention SC Freiburg. Therefore, they don't appear in any of these competitions as listed here.\n\nNext, the claim says it's about the UEFA Europe League (probably a typo for UEFA Europa League) in 2013-14, group h. Let's check that season and competition.\n\nLooking at the data, rows 4 to 6 are from the 2013-14 season and the \"uefa europa league\" competition. Each of these is under the \"group h\" round.\n\nSo, in the table, there are three entries for this specific group:\n\n- Sevilla vs someone (but home is \"-\", away is 0-2)\n- Estoril vs someone (both \"-\" which might mean no data or maybe a bye)\n- Slovan Liberec with a result of 2-2 at home.\n\nBut again, none of these clubs include SC Freiburg. The claim says they played against these three clubs in group h. Since SC Freiburg isn't listed as playing any games here, the claim is false.\n\nAlso, checking the number of times: the claim mentions \"3 times\" but without SC Freiburg being present, that part doesn't hold either.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not list SC Freiburg in the 2013-14 UEFA Europa League group h round. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me break down the claim and check each part against the data provided.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"the highest away score be 4-1 in the 2001-02 season.\" So, I need to look for the 'away' column entries in that season. Looking at the table, rows with \"2001 - 02\" under the \"season\" column are rows 1, 2, and 3.\n\nChecking each of these:\n- Row 1: away score is \"0-0\"\n- Row 2: away score is \"4-1\"\n- Row 3: away score is \"0-1\"\n\nSo, the highest away score in 2001-02 is indeed \"4-1\" from row 2.\n\nNext part of the claim: \"the lowest away score be 0-0 on 2 occasions in the 1995-96 season and the 2001-02 season.\" So I need to check for \"away\" scores equal to \"0-0\" in both seasons mentioned.\n\nFor the 1995-96 season (row 0):\n- away score is \"0-0\"\n\nIn the 2001-02 season, as above:\n- Row 1: away is \"0-0\"\nSo that's two occurrences of \"0-0\" in these seasons.\n\nWait a minute, but looking at row 4 and others, there are other entries, but they're from different seasons. So the claim seems correct so far.\n\nBut I should check if there are any other scores lower than \"0-0\". Since \"0-0\" is already the lowest possible score in away matches, that part holds.\n\nNow, compiling the relevant cells:\n- For the highest away score of 4-1: row 2's 'away' column.\n- For the two 0-0 away scores: row 0 and row 1's 'away' columns.\n\nSo all conditions are met. The answer should be TRUE with those relevant cells noted.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because:\n\n1. **Highest Away Score (4-1 in 2001-02 Season)**:\n   - Found in row 2, column \"away\".\n\n2. **Lowest Away Scores (0-0 on two occasions)**:\n   - Occurred in rows 0 and 1 under the \"away\" column for both specified seasons.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away\"},\n     {\"row_2\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nWait, in my initial breakdown, I identified the relevant rows as 0 (for 1995-96), 1 and 2 (both for 2001-02). However, upon reflection, the highest away score is row 2, and the two lowest are rows 0 and 1. So the correct JSON should list row indices 0, 1, and 2 with the \"away\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The season for that entry is indeed \"2013 - 14.\" So this part checks out.\n\nPart 2: When the club is Slavia Prague, the season should be 1995-96.\nLooking at the table, Slavia Prague is listed in row 0. The season there is correctly noted as \"1995 - 96.\" That also matches.\n\nI'll double-check each relevant cell to make sure there are no discrepancies.

The key points are:\n- sc Freiburg participates in the first round.\n- This happens twice: once in the 1995-96 season and again in the 2001-02 season.\n- Both participations are in the uefa cup competition.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table provided. The columns are \"season\", \"competition\", \"round\", \"club\", \"home\", \"away\". \n\nI need to check each row for the following:\n1. Competition is \"uefa cup\".\n2. Round is \"first round\".\n3. Club is sc Freiburg.\n4. Seasons 1995-96 and 2001-02.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\nRow 0: \n- Season: 1995 -96\n- Competition: uefa cup\n- Round: first round\n- Club: slavia prague\n\nSo, this is a first-round match in the uefa cup during 1995-96, but the club is Slavia Prague, not sc Freiburg. So no support here.\n\nRow 1:\n- Season: 2001 -02\n- Competition: uefa cup\n- Round: first round\n- Club: matador pachov\n\nAgain, first round in the uefa cup for 2001-02 season, but club is Matador Pachov. No sc Freiburg here.\n\nRow 2:\n- Season: 2001 -02\n- Competition: uefa cup\n- Round: second round\n- Club: st gallen\n\nNot first round, so irrelevant.\n\nRow 3:\n- Season: 2001 -02\n- Competition: uefa cup\n- Round: third round\n- Club: feyenoord\n\nAgain, not the first round.\n\nRows 4,5,6 are from 2013-14 season in uefa europa league, so different competition and seasons.

Each row corresponds to a match with specific details under these columns.\n\nThe claim is a bit complex, so I'll split it into two parts for easier verification:\n\n1. **First Part:** When the home score is 0 - 1 in the 2001-02 UEFA Cup, the club is St Gallen.\n2. **Second Part:** When the away score is 1 - 1 also in the 2001-02 UEFA Cup, the club is Feyenoord.\n\nI'll tackle each part separately and then combine my findings to determine if both conditions are satisfied.\n\n**Analyzing the First Part:**\n- I need to find a row where:\n  - Season is \"2001 - 02\"\n  - Competition is \"uefa cup\"\n  - Home score is \"0 - 1\"\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 1 (index 1): Season is correct, competition is correct. The home score here is \"2 - 1\", which doesn't match.\n  \n- Row 2 (index 2): Season and competition are correct. Home score is \"0 - 1\". This matches the first condition.

Row 3 has away score \"0 - 1\", and rows beyond that are from different seasons or competitions. So, there's no entry where the away score is \"1 - 1\" in the specified season.\n\n**Combining Both Parts:**\nThe first part is true because row index 2 satisfies all its conditions. However, the second part fails as there's no matching data in the table for an away score of \"1 - 1\".\n\nSince both parts need to be true for the entire claim to hold, and one part is false, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n**Identifying Relevant Cells:**\nFor the first part:\n- Row index 2 (since that's where home score is \"0 - 1\", club is \"st gallen\").\n\nFor the second part:\n- Since no row matches, but looking for away score \"1 - 1\" in season 2001-02 and competition uefa cup.

Let's check the 'away' column:\n\n- Row 1: Away score is 0-0.\n- Row 2: Away score is 4-1. Wait, that's a home game for St Gallen with away score being 4-1? Hmm, no, looking again. The columns are \"home\" and \"away\". So in row 2, 'home' is 0-1 and 'away' is 4-1. But wait, the claim mentions \"highest away score\", so I need to check the 'away' column entries for each match.\n\nWait a minute, looking at row indices:\n\nRow 1 (index 1): Club is Matador Pachov, competition is uefa cup, season 2001-02. Home is 2-1, away is 0-0.\nRow 2 (index 2): Club is St Gallen, same season. Home is 0-1, away is 4-1.\n\nSo in row 2, the away score is 4-1, which is higher than 3-1. But the claim says the highest away score is 3-1. That's a discrepancy because we have a 4-1 score. So this part of the claim might be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the columns. The 'home' and 'away' columns represent the scores for each match. For example, in row 2, home is St Gallen vs away team Feyenoord? Or wait, no: looking at the table structure, each row represents a club's performance. So row 1 is Matador Pachov as the club, with home score 2-1 and away score 0-0.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nEach row in the data represents a match for a specific club in a particular round of a competition during a season. The 'home' column shows the result when the club was at home, and 'away' shows when they were away.\n\nSo to find all away scores across the 2001-02 season, I need to look at the 'away' column for rows where the season is 2001-02.\n\nLooking through:\n\nRow index 1: season 2001-02, away score is 0-0.\nRow index 2: same season, away score is 4-1 (but wait, in row 2, 'home' is St Gallen and away is 4-1? Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me see:\n\nActually, each row's club is the one playing at home or away in that particular match. So for example, row index 2: Club is St Gallen, round second, so they were home in their first game (home score 0-1) and away in another (away score 4-1). Wait no, perhaps each row represents a single match? Or maybe not.\n\nWait the table structure might be different. Let me think again.\n\nThe columns are: season, competition, round, club, home, away.\n\nSo for example, the first data row is:\n\nSeason: 1995 - 96\nCompetition: uefa cup\nRound: first round\nClub: slavia prague\nHome: 1-2 (so when they were at home, they lost 1-2)\nAway: 0-0 (when they were away, it was a draw)\n\nSimilarly, row index 1:\n\nSeason: 2001-02\nCompetition: uefa cup\nRound: first round\nClub: matador pachov\nHome: 2-1 (they won at home)\nAway: 0-0\n\nRow index 2:\n\nSeason: 2001-02\nCompetition: uefa cup\nRound: second round\nClub: st gallen\nHome: 0-1 (lost at home)\nAway:4-1 (won away)\n\nSo in this case, the 'away' score is 4-1 for St Gallen. So that's a higher away score than the claim of 3-1.\n\nBut according to the data, the highest away score in 2001-02 season would be 4-1, not 3-1 as per the claim. Therefore, this part is incorrect.\n\nNow, checking the second part: lowest away score being 0-0 on two occasions\u2014once in 1995-96 and once in 2001-02.\n\nLooking for away scores of 0-0:\n\nRow index 0 (season 1995-96): away is 0-0. So that's one occurrence.\nRow index 1: season 2001-02, away is 0-0. That's another occurrence.\n\nSo the claim about the lowest away score being 0-0 on two occasions (once in each season) is correct.\n\nHowever, since the first part of the claim (highest away score being 3-1) is incorrect because there's a higher score of 4-1, the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the highest away score in the 2001-02 season was 3-1 and that the lowest away score of 0-0 occurred twice. However, the data shows an away score of 4-1 for St Gallen in the same season, making the highest away score higher than claimed. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is false because the highest away score in the 2001-02 season was actually 4-1, not 3-1 as stated. While the lowest away score of 0-0 did occur twice across the two seasons, the incorrect assertion about the highest score invalidates the entire claim.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{False}}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim first.\n\nThe claim says: \"sc freiburg play in thesecond round on 2 occasion in the uefa cup competition in season 1995 - 96 and 2001 - 02\"\n\nWait, I notice that the name of the club is written as \"sc freiburg\" with lowercase letters. But when looking at the table, the clubs are listed as \"slavia prague,\" \"matador pachov,\" etc. There's no mention of \"sc freiburg.\" Hmm.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. **Check if sc freiburg is in the table:**\n   - Go through each row and look at the \"club\" column.\n   - Row 0: club is slavia prague\n   - Row 1: matador pachov\n   - Row 2: st gallen\n   - Row 3: feyenoord\n   - Rows 4-6: sevilla, estoril, slovan liberec\n\n   No sc freiburg found. So the claim might be false just based on that.\n\n2. **Even if they were in the table...**\n   But let's assume maybe I'm missing something. Let's check for both seasons mentioned:\n\n   - 1995-96 season: Looking at row 0, it's about slavia prague, uefa cup, first round.\n     So no second round here.\n\n   - 2001-02 season:\n     Row 1: matador pachov, first round\n     Row 2: st gallen, second round\n     Row 3: feyenoord, third round\n\n     So in 2001-02, the second round was played by st gallen. No sc freiburg.\n\nSo both seasons don't have sc freiburg in the uefa cup's second round.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because sc freiburg isn't listed at all in these contexts.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"sc freiburg\" participated in the second round of the UEFA Cup during two specific seasons. However, upon examining the provided table, there are no entries for \"sc freiburg.\" Additionally, the relevant cells show different clubs participating in those rounds.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table in JSON format. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim says. The claim states: \"when the club be st gallen the season be 2013 - 14 and when the club be slavia prague the season be 1995 - 96\". So it's making two separate statements:\n\n1. When the club is St Gallen, the season should be 2013-14.\n2. When the club is Slavia Prague, the season should be 1995-96.\n\nI need to check both parts of this claim against the data in the table to see if they hold true.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\nThe columns are: \"season\", \"competition\", \"round\", \"club\", \"home\", \"away\".\n\nThere are several rows, each representing a different match or round. Each row has values under these columns.\n\nLet's go through each part of the claim one by one.\n\nFirst part: When club is St Gallen, season should be 2013-14.\n\nI'll scan through the \"club\" column to find any entries for St Gallen. From the data provided:\n\nRow indices (starting from 0):\n\nRow 0: Club is Slavia Prague\nRow 1: Matador Pa\u010dov\nRow 2: St Gallen\nRow 3: Feyenoord\nRow 4: Sevilla\nRow 5: Estoril\nRow 6: Slovan Liberec\n\nSo, row 2 has club \"St Gallen\". Now, what's the season for that row? Looking at the first column of row 2, it's \"2001 - 02\". Wait, that's not 2013-14. The claim says when the club is St Gallen, the season should be 2013-14, but in reality, it's 2001-02.\n\nSo this part of the claim is false because St Gallen is associated with 2001-02, not 2013-14.\n\nNow, let me check the second part just to be thorough: When club is Slavia Prague, season should be 1995-96.\n\nLooking through the \"club\" column again:\n\nRow 0: Club is Slavia Prague. The season here is indeed \"1995 - 96\", which matches the claim.\n\nSo the second part of the claim is true because Slavia Prague in row 0 has the correct season.\n\nBut since the first part of the claim is false, the entire claim isn't fully supported. Both conditions must hold for the claim to be TRUE.\n\nTherefore, the overall answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells from the table that were checked.\n\nFor St Gallen (row 2), we looked at the \"club\" and \"season\" columns. So row index 2, column names \"club\" and \"season\".\n\nFor Slavia Prague (row 0), same thing: club and season. Row index 0, columns \"club\" and \"season\".\n\nSo compiling the relevant cells:\n\nRow 2:\n- club\n- season\n\nRow 0:\n- club\n- season\n\nWait, but in the example given earlier, each cell is a separate object with row index and column name. So for row 2, we have two entries: {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"club\"} and another for \"season\". Similarly for row 0.\n\nSo the relevant_cells list should include all these four cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim has both a true and a false part. However, since one part is false, the entire claim is false. The relevant cells are those checked in rows 0 and 2 for both club names and seasons.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"club\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"club\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"season\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
