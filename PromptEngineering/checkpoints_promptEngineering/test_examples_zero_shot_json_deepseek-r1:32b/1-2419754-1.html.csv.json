    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"there be 2 institution locate within the state of ohio that be member of the great midwest conference.\" Hmm, first off, I notice some grammatical issues in the claim\u2014words like \"be\" instead of \"are\" or \"were,\" but I think it's just a typo and doesn't affect the meaning. So, focusing on the content: two institutions in Ohio that are members of the Great Midwest Conference.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents an institution with details like nickname, location, founded year, type, enrollment, joined, and left years. The columns I need to focus on for this claim are \"location\" and \"joined/left,\" as they pertain to where the institutions are located and whether they were part of a conference.\n\nFirst step: Identify which institutions are in Ohio. Scanning through the 'location' column:\n\n- University of Cincinnati is in Cincinnati, OH.\n- University of Dayton is in Dayton, OH.\n- DePaul University is in Chicago, IL.\n- Marquette University is in Milwaukee, WI.\n- University of Memphis is in Memphis, TN.\n- Saint Louis University is in St. Louis, MO.\n\nSo, only the first two rows are located in Ohio.\n\nNext, I need to determine if these institutions were members of the Great Midwest Conference. The table has \"joined\" and \"left\" columns, which likely indicate the years they joined and left a conference. But the claim mentions the \"great midwest conference.\" I should check what these numbers represent.\n\nThe joined years for University of Cincinnati are 1991, left in 1995. Similarly, University of Dayton joined in 1993 and left in 1995. DePaul joined in 1991, left in 1995; Marquette same as DePaul. The University of Memphis also has the same join and leave years, and Saint Louis too.\n\nWait a minute, all these institutions joined in either 1991 or 1993 and left in 1995. So what conference were they part of during that time? I recall that the Great Midwest Conference was a college athletics conference that existed from 1991 to 1995. It included schools like University of Cincinnati, Dayton, DePaul, Marquette, etc.\n\nSo, both the University of Cincinnati and the University of Dayton are located in Ohio and were part of the Great Midwest Conference between 1991 and 1995. Therefore, the claim is accurate because there are indeed two institutions in Ohio that were members of this conference.\n\nTo break it down:\n\n- Relevant cells for location: rows 0 and 1 under \"location.\"\n- Relevant cells for membership years: rows 0 and 1 under \"joined\" and \"left.\"\n\nThis information confirms both the state locations and their participation in the Great Midwest Conference during those specific years.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as there are two Ohio institutions that were part of the Great Midwest Conference between 1991-1995.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"left\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"left\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table in JSON format. The claim is: \"5 out of the 6 institutions that were in the great midwest conference joined the conference in 1991.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions six institutions from the Great Midwest Conference, and it's claiming that five of them joined the conference in 1991.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are six entries under the \"data\" section. Each row represents an institution with various attributes like nickname, location, founded year, type, enrollment, joined year, and left year. The columns relevant here seem to be \"joined,\" which is the year each institution joined the conference.\n\nThe claim specifies that five out of six institutions joined in 1991. So, I need to check how many institutions have a 'joined' value of 1991.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. University of Cincinnati: Joined in 1991.\n2. University of Dayton: Joined in 1993.\n3. DePaul University: Joined in 1991.\n4. Marquette University: Joined in 1991.\n5. University of Memphis: Joined in 1991.\n6. Saint Louis University: Joined in 1991.\n\nCounting the ones that joined in 1991: Cincinnati (row 0), DePaul (row 2), Marquette (row 3), Memphis (row 4), and Saint Louis (row 5). That's five institutions. The only one that didn't join in 1991 is University of Dayton, which joined in 1993.\n\nSo, the claim says exactly that: five out of six joined in 1991, which matches our count here.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells for this analysis, I need to note each row where the 'joined' year is checked. Since we're looking at each institution's 'joined' column, the relevant cells are all the rows under the \"joined\" column.\n\nSo, for each of the six institutions (rows 0 through 5), the \"joined\" column is relevant because we need to verify the year they joined. Therefore, I should list each row index with the column name \"joined.\"\n\nPutting this together, the answer should be TRUE because five out of six did indeed join in 1991. The relevant cells are all rows from 0 to 5 under the \"joined\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"joined\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"there be 2 public institution that be member of the great midwest conference\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the JSON data to understand the structure. The table has columns: institution, nickname, location, founded, type, enrollment, joined, and left. Each row represents a university with corresponding details.\n\nThe claim mentions two points:\n1. There are 2 public institutions.\n2. These institutions are members of the Great Midwest Conference (GMC).\n\nLooking at the data, I'll check each institution's 'type' to see if it's public. The relevant rows are:\n\n- Row 0: University of Cincinnati - type is \"public\"\n- Row 4: University of Memphis - type is \"public\"\n\nSo there are indeed two public institutions in the table.\n\nNext, I need to verify their membership in the GMC. The columns 'joined' and 'left' likely indicate the years they joined and left the conference. Assuming that being a member means they were part of the conference during some period, both universities have values in these columns:\n\n- University of Cincinnati: joined 1991, left 1995\n- University of Memphis: joined 1991, left 1995\n\nThis suggests both were members of a conference during those years. However, the claim specifically mentions the \"Great Midwest Conference.\" The table doesn't explicitly state that these universities were part of the GMC; it only provides the years they joined and left a conference (presumably the same one). Without explicit confirmation that this is the GMC, I can't be certain.\n\nBut given that both institutions have the same join and leave years, it's reasonable to infer they were part of the same conference. Therefore, it's plausible that they were members of the Great Midwest Conference during those years.\n\nThus, the claim holds true based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe table lists six universities with details including their type (public or private) and the years they joined and left a conference. To verify the claim:\n\n1. Identify public institutions: University of Cincinnati (row 0) and University of Memphis (row 4).\n2. Check if these institutions were members of the Great Midwest Conference by examining 'joined' and 'left' years.\n\nBoth universities have values in 'joined' and 'left', indicating membership in a conference during those periods.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the claim is: \"3 of the member of the great midwest conference be found before 1860.\" Hmm, first, I need to understand what exactly is being claimed here. It seems like it's saying that three members of a group called the Great Midwest Conference were established (founded) before the year 1860.\n\nLooking at the table provided, which has data about various universities including their founding years. The columns we're interested in are \"institution\" and \"founded.\" Each row represents a different university with details about when it was founded. So, I need to check each institution's founding year to see if three of them were established before 1860.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. University of Cincinnati: Founded in 1819. That's definitely before 1860.\n2. University of Dayton: Founded in 1850. Still before 1860.\n3. DePaul University: Founded in 1898. This is after 1860, so it doesn't count.\n4. Marquette University: Founded in 1881. Also after 1860.\n5. University of Memphis: Founded in 1912. Way after.\n6. Saint Louis University: Founded in 1818. That's before 1860.\n\nSo, counting the ones founded before 1860: Cincinnati (1819), Dayton (1850), and Saint Louis (1818). That makes three institutions. Therefore, the claim is correct because exactly three of these universities were established before 1860.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells for each of these institutions. Each relevant cell would be the \"founded\" year in their respective rows. So:\n\n- University of Cincinnati: row index 0\n- University of Dayton: row index 1\n- Saint Louis University: row index 5\n\nSo, I'll note down the column name as \"founded\" for each of these rows.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that three members were founded before 1860. Checking each university's founding year, we find three institutions (University of Cincinnati, University of Dayton, and Saint Louis University) that meet this criterion.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Scanning through the data rows:\n\n- The first row is for the University of Cincinnati. The columns are:\n  - institution: university of cincinnati\n  - nickname: bearcats\n  - location: cincinnati, ohio\n  - founded: 1819\n  - type: public\n  - enrollment: 41357\n  - joined: 1991\n  - left: 1995\n\nSo, the enrollment for the University of Cincinnati is 41,357 students.\n\nNext, I need to find Saint Louis University. Looking at each row:\n\n- The sixth row has:\n  - institution: saint louis university\n  - nickname: billikens\n  - location: st louis, missouri\n  - founded: 1818\n  - type: private\n  - enrollment: 13785\n  - joined: 1991\n  - left: 1995\n\nSo, the enrollment for Saint Louis University is 13,785 students.\n\nNow, I'll calculate the difference in enrollment between these two universities. \n\nUniversity of Cincinnati's enrollment: 41,357\nSaint Louis University's enrollment: 13,785\n\nDifference = 41,357 - 13,785 = ?\n\nLet me do the subtraction step by step to avoid errors:\n41,357 minus 10,000 is 31,357.\n31,357 minus 3,000 is 28,357.\n28,357 minus 785 is 27,572.\n\nSo the difference is 27,572 students. \n\nThe claim states that the University of Cincinnati has 27,572 more students enrolled than Saint Louis University.

I need to determine whether the claim \"all 6 institution join the great midwest conference at the same time in 1991\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: institution, nickname, location, founded, type, enrollment, joined, left. So each row represents an institution with various attributes including when they joined and left something\u2014presumably a conference.\n\nThe claim states that all six institutions joined the Great Midwest Conference in 1991. I need to check two things for each institution: whether they joined in 1991 and whether they are part of this conference.\n\nLooking at the \"joined\" column, which is the seventh element in each row (index 6), let's examine each value:\n\n1. University of Cincinnati: Joined in 1991\n2. University of Dayton: Joined in 1993\n3. DePaul University: Joined in 1991\n4. Marquette University: Joined in 1991\n5. University of Memphis: Joined in 1991\n6. Saint Louis University: Joined in 1991\n\nWait, but the second institution, University of Dayton, has a \"joined\" value of 1993, which is different from 1991. That's a problem because the claim says all six joined at the same time in 1991.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there might be a typo or misunderstanding. Maybe the \"joined\" column doesn't refer to the Great Midwest Conference but another conference. The claim specifically mentions joining the Great Midwest Conference, so I need to ensure that these institutions were part of that specific conference when they joined in 1991.\n\nLooking back at the table, each institution's \"left\" year is 1995. If all left in 1995, perhaps they were all in the same conference until then. But the claim is about joining in 1991. The University of Dayton joined in 1993 according to this data, which contradicts the claim.\n\nTherefore, since not all institutions joined in 1991\u2014specifically University of Dayton joined in 1993\u2014the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"joined\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It's saying that only private institutions were members of the Great Midwest Conference. So, if any public institution was a member, then the claim would be false.\n\nLooking at the table columns: I see \"institution\", \"nickname\", \"location\", \"founded\", \"type\", \"enrollment\", \"joined\", and \"left\". The relevant columns here are \"type\" because it indicates whether an institution is private or public, and perhaps \"joined\" and \"left\" to determine their membership period.\n\nEach row represents a university with details about their type.

If these public institutions were members of the Great Midwest Conference, then the claim that only private institutions were members would be false.\n\nTherefore, since there are public institutions listed as having joined and left (implying membership), the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to check are the \"type\" column for each institution because that's what determines if they're private or public. So, all rows under the \"type\" column need to be considered.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"more than half of the member of the great midwest conference be found before 1860\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the table. It has six institutions listed with various details. The relevant column here is \"founded,\" which indicates the year each institution was established.\n\nThe claim mentions \"more than half\" of the members. Since there are 6 institutions, more than half would be at least 4 out of 6.\n\nI'll check each institution's founded year:\n\n1. University of Cincinnati: Founded in 1819 (before 1860)\n2. University of Dayton: Founded in 1850 (before 1860)\n3. DePaul University: Founded in 1898 (after 1860)\n4. Marquette University: Founded in 1881 (after 1860)\n5. University of Memphis: Founded in 1912 (after 1860)\n6. Saint Louis University: Founded in 1818 (before 1860)\n\nNow, counting how many were founded before 1860:\n- Cincinnati: Yes\n- Dayton: Yes\n- DePaul: No\n- Marquette: No\n- Memphis: No\n- Saint Louis: Yes\n\nThat's 3 institutions founded before 1860. Since 3 is not more than half of 6 (which would require at least 4), the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are the \"founded\" column for each row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the university of cincinnati have the same number of student enrol as saint louis university\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me look at the structure of the table. The columns are: institution, nickname, location, founded, type, enrollment, joined, left. Each row represents a different university with corresponding data in these columns.\n\nThe claim compares the student enrollment numbers between two specific institutions: \"university of cincinnati\" and \"saint louis university\". So I need to find their respective enrollment figures from the table.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- The first row is for \"university of cincinnati\". Its enrollment number is 41357. This can be found in column index 5, which corresponds to \"enrollment\".\n  \n- The sixth row is for \"saint louis university\". Its enrollment number is 13785, also under the same \"enrollment\" column.\n\nNow, comparing these two numbers: 41357 vs. 13785. They are clearly different. Therefore, the claim that they have the same number of student enrollments is false.\n\nI should note down the relevant cells for each university to support this conclusion. For \"university of cincinnati\", it's row index 0 and column \"enrollment\". For \"saint louis university\", it's row index 5 and the same column.\n\nSo, compiling this information, the answer should be FALSE with the relevant cells highlighted as specified.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is about comparing the enrollment numbers of two universities. Checking each institution's data shows different enrollments, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
