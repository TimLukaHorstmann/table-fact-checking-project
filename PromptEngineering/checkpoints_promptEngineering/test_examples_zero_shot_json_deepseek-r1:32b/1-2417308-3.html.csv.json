    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"successor of both california and pennsylvania be name william.\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided in JSON format. It has columns like \"state (class)\", \"vacator\", \"reason for change\", \"successor\", and \"date of successors formal installation\". The data rows are about different states and their political changes around that time.\n\nThe claim mentions two states: California and Pennsylvania, and it's saying both have a successor named William. I need to check each state's row in the table to see what the successor is.\n\nLooking at the table, let me go through each relevant row. \n\nStarting with California. The fifth row (index 3) shows that the state is California (3), the vacator is vacant, reason is legislature failed to elect on time. The successor is William M Gwin (D). So yes, the successor starts with William.\n\nNow checking Pennsylvania. That's the third row (index 2). It mentions Pennsylvania (3), same situation as others\u2014legislature didn't elect on time. The successor here is William Bigler (D). Again, the name starts with William.\n\nWait a minute, both successors are indeed named William. California has William M Gwin and Pennsylvania has William Bigler. So according to the table, both have successors named William. That would make the claim TRUE.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should ensure there's no other successor in these rows that might contradict this. Looking back at all the data rows, only California (3) and Pennsylvania (3) are relevant for this claim. The others involve different states\u2014New Hampshire, Alabama, Indiana\u2014and their successors don't affect this particular claim.\n\nSo yes, both successors are named William. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that both California and Pennsylvania have successors whose names start with \"William,\" supporting the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"successor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"successor\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The columns we have are \"state (class)\", \"vacator\", \"reason for change\", \"successor\", and \"date of successors formal installation\".\n\nThe key information I need is in the \"date of successors formal installation\" column because that tells me when each successor took office. My task is to count how many of these dates fall between 1855 and 1857.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. **New Hampshire (2)**: The date here is July 30, 1855. That's within the range since 1855 starts from January 1, so this counts.\n2. **Alabama (3)**: November 26, 1855. Also in 1855, so that's another one.\n3. **Pennsylvania (3)**: January 14, 1856. That's within the specified years.\n4. **California (3)**: January 13, 1857. Still within the range as it's in 1857.\n5. **Indiana (3)**: February 4, 1857. Also falls within 1855-1857.\n\nWait a minute, that gives me five successors, not two. The claim says there are only two. So if I count all the dates in the specified period, each row corresponds to one successor. Therefore, the number of successors between 1855 and 1857 is more than two\u2014it's actually five.\n\nBut let me double-check each date:\n\n- July 30, 1855: Yes.\n- November 26, 1855: Yes.\n- January 14, 1856: Yes.\n- January 13, 1857: Yes.\n- February 4, 1857: Yes.\n\nAll five dates fall within the range from 1855 to 1857. So the claim that there are two successors is incorrect; it's actually five. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells, I need to list all the rows where the date falls within the specified period because each of those contributes to the count. The column in question for each row is \"date of successors formal installation\". So for each row from 0 to 4, that's five entries.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there are two successors between 1855 and 1857, but the table shows five. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
