    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to verify the claim about David Bielkheden fighting a total of 4 games in Turku, Finland, with 75% wins. Let me go through the data step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for all rows where the location is Turku, Finland. Scanning down the 'Location' column:\n\n- Row 2: Helsinki, Finland\n- Row 6: Turku, Finland (Fight Night 2)\n- Row 18: Stockholm, Sweden\n- Row 20: Helsinki, Finland\n- Row 23: Turku, Finland (FinnFight 5)\n- Row 24: Turku, Finland (FinnFight 7)\n- Row 26: Helsinki, Finland\n- Row 29: Turku, Finland (Capital Punishment 2)\n- Row 30: Helsinki, Finland\n- Row 31: Turku, Finland (Cold War)\n\nWait, that's more than four fights in Turku. Let me count again:\n\nLooking at each row's location:\n\nRow 6: Turku\nRow 23: Turku\nRow 24: Turku\nRow 29: Turku\nRow 31: Turku\n\nThat's actually five fights in Turku, not four as the claim states. So the total number is off.\n\nNow, checking how many of those he won:\n\nLooking at each row where location is Turku:\n\n- Row 6: Result is 'x win' (he won)\n- Row 23: Result is 'x loss' (lost)\n- Row 24: Result is 'x win' (won)\n- Row 29: Result is 'x win' (won)\n- Row 31: Result is 'x win' (won)\n\nSo out of five fights, he won four times. That's 80% wins, not 75%.\n\nBut the claim says four games with 75% wins. Since both numbers don't match, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states 4 fights in Turku with 75% wins, but there are actually five fights, of which he won four (80%).

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"david bielkheden win a majority of his match by unanimous decision\" is true or false based on the provided data table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. The claim has two main points:\n\n1. David Bielkheden wins a majority of his matches.\n2. Most of these wins are by unanimous decisions.\n\nTo verify this, I'll need to look at the results of all his fights in the table and see if both conditions hold true.\n\nLooking at the \"Result\" column (which is \"column_1\"), each row indicates whether he won or lost a match. The claim says he has a majority of wins, so I'll count how many times \"win\" appears versus \"loss\".\n\nNext, for the method of victory, the claim specifies that these wins are by unanimous decision. Unanimous decisions occur when all judges agree on the outcome. In the table, this is indicated in the \"Method\" column (column_4). A unanimous decision would be labeled as such.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Win via TKO\nRow 1: Loss via TKO\nRow 2: Win via Submission\nRow 3: Win via Decision (unanimous)\nRow 4: Win via Decision (unanimous)\nRow 5: Win via Decision (unanimous)\nRow 6: Win via Decision (split)\nRow 7: Win via Decision (unanimous)\nRow 8: Loss via Decision\nRow 9: Loss via Submission\nRow 10: Loss via Decision\n\nNow, counting the wins and losses:\n\nWins:\n- Row 0: Win\n- Row 2: Win\n- Row 3: Win\n- Row 4: Win\n- Row 5: Win\n- Row 6: Win\n- Row 7: Win\n\nThat's 7 wins.\n\nLosses:\n- Row 1: Loss\n- Row 8: Loss\n- Row 9: Loss\n- Row 10: Loss\n\nThat's 4 losses. So, 7 wins out of 11 total matches is a majority.\n\nNext, looking at the method of victory for these 7 wins:\n\nRow 3: Unanimous decision\nRow 4: Unanimous decision\nRow 5: Unanimous decision\nRow 6: Split decision (not unanimous)\nRow 7: Unanimous decision\n\nSo out of 7 wins, 4 are via unanimous decisions. The other two wins are by TKO and submission, which don't involve judges' decisions.\n\nWait, actually, let me recount:\n\nRows with \"Result\" = Win:\n0: Win (TKO)\n2: Win (Submission)\n3: Win (Unanimous)\n4: Win (Unanimous)\n5: Win (Unanimous)\n6: Win (Split)\n7: Win (Unanimous)\n\nSo, in total, 4 wins are by unanimous decision. The other three wins are via TKO or submission.\n\nThe claim states that he \"win a majority of his match by unanimous decision.\" So, does this mean the majority of his matches are won, and among those wins, most are by unanimous decisions?\n\nHe has 7 wins out of 11 matches, which is a majority. But in terms of the method, only 4 out of 7 wins are by unanimous decision. This isn't a majority because 4/7 is less than half (which would be at least 4 if considering integer division). Wait, actually, 4 out of 7 is about 57%, which is more than half. But let me clarify: the claim says \"a majority of his match\" by unanimous decision. So does it mean that most of his matches are won via unanimous decisions?\n\nBut looking again, he has 7 wins, but only 4 are via unanimous decisions. The other three wins are via other methods. Therefore, while he has a majority of wins overall, the majority of his victories are not by unanimous decisions; instead, only about 57% of his wins are via that method.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim is interpreted as most of his matches (not just wins) being decided by unanimous decision, then that's different. But looking at all 11 matches:\n\nRows with \"Method\" = Unanimous Decision: rows 3,4,5,7 \u2192 4 times.\nOther methods: TKO (row0), Submission (row2), Split (row6), Losses (rows1,8,9,10).\n\nSo out of all 11 matches, only 4 were decided by unanimous decision. The rest are via other means or losses.\n\nTherefore, the claim that he wins a majority of his matches by unanimous decision is not accurate because while he has more wins than losses overall, most of his victories are not by unanimous decisions; they're split between different methods.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"David Bielkheden win a majority of his match by unanimous decision\" is **false**. \n\nWhile David Bielkheden does have a majority of wins (7 out of 11 matches), the majority of these victories are not achieved through unanimous decisions. Only four of his seven wins are via unanimous decision, with the remaining three wins resulting from TKO and submission. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is false.",

Let me start by understanding the claim and then checking each relevant cell in the table.\n\nFirst, the claim states that David Bielkhelden has won all of his matches where the outcome was either a TKO (Technical Knockout) or KO (Knockout). So, I need to look through each row of the data and check for two things: what was the result of the match (win or loss), and whether the end condition was a TKO or KO.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a match. The columns are:\n\n0: Result\n1: Opponent\n2: Method\n3: Event\n4: Date\n\nI think \"Result\" indicates if David won or lost that match. The \"Method\" column would tell me how the fight ended\u2014whether it was by TKO, KO, submission, etc.\n\nSo my plan is to go through each row and:\n\n1. Check if the method of the fight was either TKO or KO.\n2. For those rows where the method is TKO or KO, check what the result was (win or loss).\n3. If in any such case the result is a loss, then the claim is false. Otherwise, it's true.\n\nLet me go through each row step by step.\n\nRow 0:\n- Result: Win\n- Method: Submission\nSince the method isn't TKO or KO, this doesn't affect our claim.\n\nRow 1:\n- Result: Loss\n- Method: Decision (unanimous)\nAgain, not relevant because the method is a decision.\n\nRow 2:\n- Result: Win\n- Method: TKO (strikes)\nThis is relevant.

From the above analysis, every time the method was KO or TKO, the result was a win for David. There are no cases where he lost via KO or TKO in this data.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided table, it seems that David Bielkhelden has indeed won every match that ended with a TKO or KO.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It claims that Tommy Depret is one of twelve fighters who have defeated David Bielkhenen in his career. So, my task is to check if Tommy Depret appears in the list of opponents that David has lost to, and also see how many losses David has according to the table.\n\nLooking at the data structure provided, it's a JSON object with a \"table\" key containing rows. Each row represents an event where David Bielkhenen participated. The columns include details like Opponent, Result, Date, Round, Time, Location, and Event.\n\nI need to go through each row of the table and look for entries where David lost. Specifically, I'm looking for any row where the \"Result\" column says \"Loss\" and check who the opponent was in those cases.\n\nLet me start by scanning each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Opponent is Tommy Depret, Result is Loss. So this is one loss against Tommy Depret.\n2. Row 1: Opponent is Chris Tuchscherer, Result is Win. Not a loss.\n3. Row 2: Opponent is Jan Bujnacki, Result is Win. Not a loss.\n4. Row 3: Opponent is Michael Bisping, Result is Loss. So that's another loss against Michael Bisping.\n5. Row 4: Opponent is Danieliaux Gauthier, Result is Win. Not a loss.\n6. Row 5: Opponent is Maki Saito, Result is Loss. That's a third loss.\n7. Row 6: Opponent is Yushin Okami, Result is Loss. Fourth loss.\n8. Row 7: Opponent is Thales Leites, Result is Loss. Fifth loss.\n9. Row 8: Opponent is Rousimar Palhares, Result is Loss. Sixth loss.\n10. Row 9: Opponent is Muhammed Lawal, Result is Win. Not a loss.\n11. Row 10: Opponent is Chris Leben, Result is Loss. Seventh loss.\n12. Row 11: Opponent is Matt Hume, Result is Win. Not a loss.\n13. Row 12: Opponent is Paul Daley, Result is Win. Not a loss.\n14. Row 13: Opponent is Matt Grice, Result is Loss. Eighth loss.\n15. Row 14: Opponent is Joe Doerksen, Result is Win. Not a loss.\n16. Row 15: Opponent is Amaury Leboucher, Result is Loss. Ninth loss.\n17. Row 16: Opponent is Matt Mitrione, Result is Loss. Tenth loss.\n18. Row 17: Opponent is Dan Henderson, Result is Win. Not a loss.\n19. Row 18: Opponent is Cung Le, Result is Loss. Eleventh loss.\n20. Row 19: Opponent is Daniel Cormier, Result is Loss. Twelfth loss.\n\nWait a minute, I'm counting more than twelve losses here. Let me recount:\n\n- Tommy Depret (Row 0): 1\n- Michael Bisping (Row 3): 2\n- Maki Saito (Row 5): 3\n- Yushin Okami (Row 6): 4\n- Thales Leites (Row 7): 5\n- Rousimar Palhares (Row 8): 6\n- Chris Leben (Row 10): 7\n- Matt Grice (Row 13): 8\n- Amaury Leboucher (Row 15): 9\n- Matt Mitrione (Row 16): 10\n- Cung Le (Row 18): 11\n- Daniel Cormier (Row 19): 12\n\nSo that's twelve losses in total. Now, looking at the opponents, Tommy Depret is listed as one of those twelve fighters who have defeated David Bielkhenen. Therefore, the claim seems to be correct.\n\nI should also ensure that all these rows are correctly marked as \"Loss\" and that each opponent corresponds accurately. From my initial scan, it looks like each row with a \"Result\" of Loss indeed has an Opponent listed, and Tommy Depret is present in one of those rows.\n\nSo, putting this together, the claim is TRUE because Tommy Depret is one of the twelve fighters who have defeated David Bielkhenen according to the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Tommy Depret is one of twelve fighters who have defeated David Bielkhenen.

Tommy Depret is indeed one of the twelve fighters who have defeated David Bielkhenen in his career based on the provided data.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Claim:** The claim asserts that Tommy Depret is among twelve fighters who have defeated David Bielkhenen.\n2. **Analyze the Table:** Examine each row for a \"Loss\" result under the \"Result\" column to determine opponents who defeated David.\n3. **Count Losses:** Found twelve losses with distinct opponents, including Tommy Depret (Row 0).\n4. **Verify Opponents:** Confirmed that each of these twelve entries lists an opponent who caused a loss.\n5. **Conclusion:** The claim holds true as Tommy Depret is one of the twelve fighters listed.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is TRUE.

The event took place in Stockholm, Sweden.\n2. It was a win (specifically a highest record win).\n3. The opponent was Nikola Matic.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with various details. I need to find any rows that match these criteria.\n\nStarting with the location: I'll scan through each row's \"Location\" column to see if it says Stockholm, Sweden.\n- Row 18 mentions \"Stockholm, sweden\" as the location. Let me note this down.\n\nNext, checking if this was a win:\n- In the \"Result\" column of row 18, the result is listed as \"x win\". Since \"x\" typically denotes the fighter's own record (assuming x is Bielkheden), this indicates a win.\n\nNow, verifying the opponent:\n- The \"Opponent\" in row 18 is Patrick Vall\u00e9e. Wait, that doesn't match Nikola Matic. So the opponent here isn't Matic.\n\nLooking for any other rows where the location is Stockholm, Sweden:\n- Row 20 also mentions \"Stockholm, sweden\". Checking its details: Result is \"x win\" and opponent is Patrick Vall\u00e9e again. No mention of Nikola Matic here either.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a row. Let me go through all rows again.\nRow 17: Location is Stockholm, Sweden, result is \"x loss\", so that's a loss.\nRow 18: Win against Patrick Vall\u00e9e.\nRow 20: Another win against Patrick Vall\u00e9e in Stockholm.\nI don't see any match against Nikola Matic in Stockholm. \n\nLooking at all rows, the only mentions of Stockholm are in rows 17, 18, and 20, none involving Nikola Matic as an opponent.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"david bielkheden have lose every match that end with a tko or ko across his career\" is true based on the provided data. \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It states that David Bielkheden has lost every match where the outcome was either a TKO (Technical Knockout) or KO (Knockout). So, I need to check each row in the table to see if there are any matches where he lost by TKO or KO. If all such matches resulted in losses, the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nLooking at the data structure, the JSON has a \"data\" field which contains an array of rows under \"rows\". Each row represents a match and includes details like outcome (\"Result\"), method of finish (\"Method of Finish\"), and whether he won or lost. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Result is \"Win\", Method of Finish is \"KO\". Since it's a win, this doesn't affect the claim about losses.\n\n2. **Row 1**: Result is \"Loss\", Method of Finish is \"Decision - Unanimous\". Not TKO or KO, so not relevant here.\n\n3. **Row 2**: Result is \"Loss\", Method of Finish is \"Submission (Armbar)\". Again, not a TKO or KO loss.\n\n4. **Row 3**: Result is \"Win\", Method of Finish is \"TKO - Strikes\". A win by TKO doesn't impact the claim about losses.\n\n5. **Row 4**: Result is \"Loss\", Method of Finish is \"Decision - Split\". Not relevant.\n\n6. **Row 5**: Result is \"Loss\", Method of Finish is \"KO\". This is a loss via KO, which is relevant. So, this row supports part of the claim.\n\n7. **Row 6**: Result is \"Win\", Method of Finish is \"Submission (Armbar)\". Not relevant.\n\n8. **Row 7**: Result is \"Loss\", Method of Finish is \"KO\". Another relevant loss by KO.\n\n9. **Row 8**: Result is \"Loss\", Method of Finish is \"Decision - Majority\". Not relevant.\n\n10. **Row 9**: Result is \"Win\", Method of Finish is \"KO\". A win, so not relevant.\n\n11. **Row 10**: Result is \"Loss\", Method of Finish is \"TKO - Strikes\". This is a loss via TKO, which supports the claim.\n\n12. **Row 11**: Result is \"Win\", Method of Finish is \"KO\". A win, so not relevant.\n\n13. **Row 12**: Result is \"Loss\", Method of Finish is \"TKO - Strikes\". Another relevant loss by TKO.\n\n14. **Row 13**: Result is \"Win\", Method of Finish is \"Decision\". Not relevant.\n\n15. **Row 14**: Result is \"Loss\", Method of Finish is \"KO\". Relevant loss via KO.\n\nNow, I need to check if every match ending in a TKO or KO resulted in a loss. From the above analysis:\n\n- Rows 5 (KO), 7 (KO), 10 (TKO), and 12 (TKO) are all losses.\n  \nAre there any matches where he lost via TKO or KO? Yes, as per the rows listed.\n\nWait, but I also need to check if there are any instances where he won via TKO or KO. For example:\n\n- Rows 3, 9, and 11 show wins by TKO or KO. These are wins, so they don't affect the claim because the claim is about losses only. \n\nTherefore, in all cases where David Bielkheden lost, if the method was either TKO or KO, he indeed lost those matches. There's no instance of a loss via TKO or KO that isn't present, and every such match resulted in a loss.\n\nWait, but looking back at row 10: \"Loss\" with Method \"TKO - Strikes\". So that's another loss by TKO. \n\nI think I've covered all relevant rows. Since all matches ending in TKO or KO where the result was a loss are present and correctly categorized, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Method of Finish\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Method of Finish\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Method of Finish\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Method of Finish\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to verify the claim: \"David Bielkheden wins a majority of his matches by KO.\" First, let's look at the data provided in the table.\n\nThe table has 30 rows, each representing a match. The columns include Outcome, KO/TKO/Submission, etc. So, relevant cells would be under these two columns for each row.\n\nI'll check each row to see if the outcome is a win and whether it was by KO or TKO.\n\nStarting from row 0:\n- Row 0: Outcome is Win, KO/TKO/Submission is KO. That's one win by KO.\nRow 1: Win, KO again. Second.\nRow 2: Win, Submission. Not KO.\nRow 3: Win, KO. Third.\nRow 4: Loss, so irrelevant.\nRow 5: Win, TKO. Counts as a KO? Maybe, but the claim specifically says \"KO.\" So maybe not counting this as it's TKO.\nRow 6: Win, Submission. Not KO.\nRow 7: Win, KO. Fourth.\nRow 8: Loss, so no.\nRow 9: Win, TKO. Again, same consideration.\nRow 10: Win, KO. Fifth.\nRow 11: Win, KO. Sixth.\nRow 12: Win, Submission. No.\nRow 13: Loss.\nRow 14: Win, TKO.\nRow 15: Win, KO. Seventh.\nRow 16: Win, KO. Eighth.\nRow 17: Loss.\nRow 18: Win, KO. Ninth.\nRow 19: Win, KO. Tenth.\nRow 20: Win, Submission.\nRow 21: Win, TKO.\nRow 22: Win, KO. Eleventh.\nRow 23: Win, KO. Twelfth.\nRow 24: Loss.\nRow 25: Win, KO. Thirteenth.\nRow 26: Win, TKO.\nRow 27: Win, KO. Fourteenth.\nRow 28: Win, KO. Fifteenth.\nRow 29: Loss.\n\nWait, let me recount the wins by KO specifically. Rows where Outcome is Win and KO/TKO/Submission is KO:\nRows 0,1,3,7,10,11,15,16,18,19,22,23,25,27,28.\n\nThat's 15 wins by KO. Now, let's check how many total matches he has. The table has 30 rows, but only some are his matches? Wait, the name in each row is \"David Bielkheden\"? Let me check. Actually, looking at the JSON data, all rows have \"name\": \"david bielkheden\" (lowercase). So, all 30 rows are his matches.\n\nNow, how many total wins does he have? Let's count Outcome == Win: Rows 0-28 except where outcome is Loss. Looking through each row:\n\nRows with Outcome = Win: \n0,1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10,11,12,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28.\n\nWait, row 17 is Outcome = Loss, so no. Similarly, row 24: Loss. So total wins are from rows where Outcome is Win:\n\nLooking at each row:\n0: Win\n1: Win\n2: Win\n3: Win\n5: Win\n6: Win\n7: Win\n9: Win\n10: Win\n11: Win\n12: Win\n14: Win\n15: Win\n16: Win\n18: Win\n19: Win\n20: Win\n21: Win\n22: Win\n23: Win\n25: Win\n26: Win\n27: Win\n28: Win\n\nThat's 24 wins. Wait, row 4 is Loss, so not counted.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount:\n\nRows where Outcome is Win:\n0,1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10,11,12,14,15,16,18,19,20,21,22,23,25,26,27,28. That's 24 rows.\n\nNow, out of these 24 wins, how many are by KO? Earlier I thought it was 15, but let me recount:\n\nRows where Outcome=Win and KO/TKO/Submission=KO:\n0: KO\n1: KO\n3: KO\n7: KO\n10: KO\n11: KO\n15: KO\n16: KO\n18: KO\n19: KO\n22: KO\n23: KO\n25: KO\n27: KO\n28: KO\n\nThat's 15 wins by KO. So total wins: 24, KO wins: 15.\n\nNow, does 15 out of 24 constitute a majority? Let's calculate 15/24 = 0.625 or 62.5%, which is more than half. Therefore, yes, he wins a majority by KO.\n</think>\n\nDavid Bielkheden has 24 total wins, with 15 of them achieved via KO. Since 15 is more than half of 24 (which is 12), the claim holds true.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, David Bielkheden wins a majority of his matches by KO. \n\nThe relevant cells are all rows where Outcome is \"Win\" and KO/TKO/Submission is \"KO\". The count shows he has more wins by KO than any other method.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given data table. The claim is: \"tommy depret be 1 of the 14 fighter that david bielkheden have lose to in his career.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse this carefully. The claim suggests that Tommy DePret is one of fourteen fighters who David BielkhiDen has lost to in his career. So, I need to check if there's a row where the Opponent is Tommy DePret and the Result for David is a loss.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a fight between two fighters: Fighter A (in column 1) and Fighter B (in column 2). The Result indicates who won that particular fight. So, if David BielkhiDen lost to Tommy DePret, there should be a row where either Fighter A is Tommy DePret and Result shows he won, or Fighter B is Tommy DePret and the Result shows he won.\n\nI'll go through each row to find any mention of Tommy DePret. Scanning through all 29 rows:\n\nRow indices from 0 to 28. Checking column \"Fighter A\" and \"Fighter B\":\n\n- Looking for \"Tommy DePret\" in either Fighter A or B.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the data, I don't see any row where either Fighter A or Fighter B is Tommy DePret. Let me double-check:\n\nRows 0 to 28: no mention of Tommy DePret anywhere in Fighter A or B columns.\n\nTherefore, there's no evidence in this table that David BielkhiDen lost to Tommy DePret. The claim can't be supported because the data doesn't include such a fight.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

    "claim": "david bielkheden fight a total of 5 game in turku , finland , 75% of which be win",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided data. The claim states: \"david bielkheden fight a total of 5 games in turku , finland , 75% of which be win.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. So, the claim has two main points:\n1. David Bielkhieden fought a total of 5 fights in Turku, Finland.\n2. Out of these 5 fights, he won 75% of them.\n\nI'll start by looking through the data to find all the fights that took place in Turku, Finland. Then, I'll count how many there are and check how many were wins.\n\nLooking at the data structure provided, it's a JSON object with an \"events\" array containing multiple fight records. Each event has details like result (win or loss), opponent, date, location, etc.\n\nI need to go through each row in the events array and look for the ones where the location is Turku, Finland.\n\nLet me go step by step:\n\n1. **Identify all fights in Turku, Finland:**\n   - I'll scan each event's \"location\" field.\n   - The locations that match Turku, Finland will be noted.\n\n2. **Count these fights:**\n   - Once identified, count how many such events there are.\n\n3. **Determine the number of wins:**\n   - For each fight in Turku, check if the result is a win.\n   - Count the total wins and see if 75% of 5 is 3.75, which would mean at least 4 wins since you can't have a fraction of a win.\n\nWait, actually, 75% of 5 fights is 3.75. Since we're dealing with whole numbers, having exactly 4 wins out of 5 would be more than 75%. So if there are 5 fights and he won 4 or more, the claim holds.\n\nBut let's see what the data says.\n\nLooking through each event:\n\n- Row 2: Location is Helsinki, Finland. Not Turku.\n- Row 3: Helsinki again.\n- Row 4: Hakata, Japan. No.\n- Row 5: Stockholm, Sweden.\n- Row 6: Belfast, Northern Ireland.\n- Row 7: Stockholm again.\n- Row 8: Tokyo, Japan.\n- Row 9: Helsinki, Finland. Not Turku.\n- Row 10: Helsinki again? Or is it different? Let me check.\n\nWait, actually, let's go through each row systematically:\n\nLooking at the \"events\" array, each element has a \"location\". I need to find all where location is \"Turku, Finland\".\n\nLet me list them out:\n\n- Row 15: Location is Helsinki, Finland. Not Turku.\n- Row 16: Helsinki again.\n- Row 20: Location is Helsinki, Finland? Wait, checking the data again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the rows because the indices might not be correctly noted. Let me check each event in order:\n\nStarting from row index 0 to 34 (assuming the events array has 35 elements):\n\nRow 19: Location is \"tokyo , japan\" \u2014 no.\nRow 20: Location is \"helsinki , finland\" \u2014 not Turku.\nRow 21: \"ft lauderdale , florida , united states\" \u2014 no.\nRow 22: \"turku , finland\"? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the events array, perhaps I need to scan each event's location.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to note that in the data provided, there are a few fights in Turku, Finland. For example, looking through the list:\n\n- One fight is in Turku, Finland: row where result is \"x win\", opponent is Kimmo Nurkse, location \"turku , finland\" \u2014 that's row index 28.\n- Another fight in Turku, Finland: row index 30, result is \"x loss\".\n- Also, perhaps another fight in Turku: let me check each event.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the events where location is Turku, Finland:\n\nLooking through each event:\n\nRow 14: Location is Helsinki, Finland.\nRow 27: Location is Turku, Finland. Result: x win against Kimmo Nurkse.\nRow 30: Location is Turku, Finland. Result: x loss against Arben Lafti.\nRow 31: Location is Turku, Finland? Let me check:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let's look for \"turku , finland\" in the location field.\n\nLooking through each event:\n\n- Row index 27: location \"turku , finland\". Result is x win.\n- Row index 30: location \"turku , finland\". Result is x loss.\n\nWait, that's only two fights. So total of 2 fights in Turku, Finland.\n\nBut the claim says 5 fights. That would mean the data contradicts the claim because there are only 2 fights in Turku.\n\nTherefore, the first part of the claim is incorrect: it's not 5 fights but 2.\n\nSince the first part is wrong, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking through each event's location:\n\nRow 0: Location \"helsinki , finland\" \u2014 no.\nRow 1: \"helsinki , finland\".\nRow 2: \"hakata , japan\".\nRow 3: \"stockholm , sweden\".\nRow 4: \"belfast , northern ireland\".\nRow 5: \"tokyo , japan\".\nRow 6: \"helsinki , finland\".\nRow 7: \"turku , finland\" \u2014 yes, this is one.\nResult: x win against Kimmo Nurkse. So that's a win.\n\nRow 8: \"helsinki , finland\".\nRow 9: \"helsinki , finland\".\nRow 10: \"ft lauderdale , florida , united states\".\nRow 11: \"turku , finland\" \u2014 another one.\nResult: x loss against Arben Lafti. So that's a loss.\n\nAre there any others?\n\nLooking through the rest:\n\nRow 12: \"helsinki , finland\".\nRow 13: \"helsinki , finland\".\nRow 14: \"helsinki , finland\".\nRow 15: \"hakata , japan\".\nRow 16: \"stockholm , sweden\".\nRow 17: \"belfast , northern ireland\".\nRow 18: \"tokyo , japan\".\nRow 19: \"helsinki , finland\".\nRow 20: \"helsinki , finland\".\nRow 21: \"ft lauderdale , florida , united states\".\nRow 22: \"turku , finland\"? Let me check the data again.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some rows. The events array has multiple entries, and I need to ensure I'm not missing any with Turku as the location.\n\nAfter checking all rows, it seems there are only two fights in Turku, Finland:\n\n1. Row index 7: x win against Kimmo Nurkse.\n2. Row index 10: x loss against Arben Lafti.\n\nWait, that can't be right because row indices might not match. Let me recount carefully.\n\nLooking at the data structure, each event is an object in the \"events\" array. I'll go through each one:\n\n- Event 0: location Helsinki\n- Event 1: Helsinki\n- Event 2: Hakata\n- Event 3: Stockholm\n- Event 4: Belfast\n- Event 5: Tokyo\n- Event 6: Helsinki\n- Event 7: Turku (win)\n- Event 8: Helsinki\n- Event 9: Helsinki\n- Event 10: Ft.

Lauderdale\n- Event 22: Turku? Let me check the data again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some events. The initial count might have been off because the array is longer. Let me go through each event step by step:\n\nLooking at each event in order:\n\nEvent 0:\n{\n  \"result\": \"x win\",\n  \"opponent\": \"Oleksandr Usyk\",\n  \"date\": \"2023-11-18\",\n  \"location\": \"helsinki , finland\"\n}\n\nNot Turku.\n\nEvent 1:\n{\n  \"result\": \"x loss\",\n  \"opponent\": \"Klinton Salazaro\",\n  \"date\": \"2023-10-14\",\n  \"location\": \"helsinki , finland\"\n}\n\nStill Helsinki.\n\nEvent 2:\n{\n  \"result\": \"x win\",\n  \"opponent\": \"Shahram Ahmadi\",\n  \"date\": \"2023-08-12\",\n  \"location\": \"hakata , japan\"\n}\n\nHakata, Japan.

Result: Win against Klinton Salazaro.\n- **Event 11**: Took place on September 3, 2022, in Turku, Finland. Result: Loss to Shahram Ahmadi.\n\nThus, there are **two events** that occurred in Turku.",
