The columns are: Unnamed: 0 (which seems to be the episode number), episode title, romanized title, translation of title, broadcast date, and ratings. \n\nThe claim compares episodes 9 and 3 based on their ratings. So my first step is to find the rows corresponding to these two episodes.\n\nLooking through the data array:\n\n- Episode 2 is row index 0\n- Episode 3 is row index 1\n- Episode 4 is row index 2\n- Episode 5 is row index 3\n- Episode 6 is row index 4\n- Episode 7 is row index 5\n- Episode 9 is row index 6 (I notice there's no episode 8, which might be a mistake in the data)\n- Episode 10 is row index 7\n\nWait, actually, looking at the \"Unnamed: 0\" column:\n\nRow 0: ep 2 \u2192 episode 2\nRow 1: ep 3 \u2192 episode 3\nRow 2: ep 4 \u2192 episode 4\nRow 3: ep 5 \u2192 episode 5\nRow 4: ep 6 \u2192 episode 6\nRow 5: ep 7 \u2192 episode 7\nRow 6: ep 9 \u2192 episode 9 (so there's no data for episode 8)\nRow 7: ep 10 \u2192 episode 10\n\nSo, to find the ratings for episodes 3 and 9, I need their respective rows.\n\nFor Episode 3:\n- Row index 1\n- The columns are as per the order. The sixth column (index 5) is \"ratings\".\n- So, row 1's rating is 13.8%.\n\nFor Episode 9:\n- It's in row index 6.\n- Again, the ratings are in the sixth position.\n- So, row 6's rating is 14.5%.\n\nNow, comparing 14.5% (episode 9) and 13.8% (episode 3), episode 9 has a higher rating.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- For Episode 3: row index 1, column \"ratings\"\n- For Episode 9: row index 6, column \"ratings\"\n\nSo I need to list these two cells in the relevant_cells array.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The table has several columns: \"Unnamed: 0\", \"episode title\", \"romanized title\", \"translation of title\", \"broadcast date\", and \"ratings\". My main focus is on the \"broadcast date\" column since that's relevant to checking when each episode was aired.\n\nLooking at the data rows, there are entries from ep2 to ep10. Each row has a broadcast date. I need to check if all these dates fall within the same year or not.\n\nLet me list out the broadcast dates:\n\n- Ep 2: July 15, 2005\n- Ep 3: July 22, 2005\n- Ep 4: July 29, 2005\n- Ep 5: August 5, 2005\n- Ep 6: August 12, 2005\n- Ep 7: August 19, 2005\n- Ep 9: September 2, 2005\n- Ep 10: September 9, 2005\n\nWait a minute, I notice that there's no ep8 in the data.

Each broadcast date is either July, August, or September 2005. So all these episodes were broadcast in the same year, which is 2005.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"all of the tv series be broadcast in the same year\" is true because every listed episode has a broadcast date within 2005.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"episode 3 be broadcast day 7 after episode 2\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: Unnamed: 0 (which seems to be the episode number), episode title, romanized title, translation of title, broadcast date, and ratings. Each row corresponds to an episode with its details.\n\nThe claim is about the broadcast dates of episodes 2 and 3. Specifically, it says that episode 3 was broadcasted 7 days after episode 2. So I need to check the broadcast dates for these two episodes.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- For Episode 2 (row index 0), the broadcast date is \"july 15, 2005\".\n- For Episode 3 (row index 1), the broadcast date is \"july 22, 2005\".\n\nNow, I need to calculate the difference between these two dates. July has 31 days, so from July 15th to July 22nd is exactly 7 days later. That seems straightforward.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. If episode 2 was on the 15th, adding 7 days would land on the 22nd. Yes, that's correct because 15 +7 =22. So there are exactly 7 days between them.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true. The relevant cells are the broadcast dates of episodes 2 and 3.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that episode 3 was broadcasted 7 days after episode 2. By examining the broadcast dates from the table, we can confirm this as true.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Episodes:**\n   - Episode 2 is in row index 0.\n   - Episode 3 is in row index 1.\n\n2. **Extract Broadcast Dates:**\n   - Episode 2's broadcast date: July 15, 2005\n   - Episode 3's broadcast date: July 22, 2005\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - From July 15 to July 22 is exactly 7 days.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is TRUE as the broadcast dates are exactly a week apart.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format.\n\nThe claim states: \"trust yourself! your mark will surely improve and friendship or entrance final decision have the same rating percent.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. \"Trust yourself! Your mark will surely improve.\"\n2. \"Friendship or entrance exam final decision have the same rating percent.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with details like title and ratings.\n\nFor the first part: The phrase \"trust yourself! your marks will surely improve\" should match a translation of one of the episodes. Scanning through the 'translation of title' column, I find that in row index 6 (0-based counting), the translation is exactly \"Trust yourself! your marks will surely improve.\" So this part is true.\n\nFor the second part: The claim mentions two titles\u2014\"friendship or entrance final decision\" and presumably another one. Looking for these phrases in the 'translation of title' column:\n\n- I find \"friendship or entrance exam final decision\" at row index 7.\n- Now, checking the ratings for this episode (row 7), it's 14.5%.\n\nI need to see if there's another episode with the same rating. Looking through all rows, I notice that both ep 9 and ep 10 have a rating of 14.5%. However, the claim specifies \"friendship or entrance final decision\" and another entry. Since only one other episode (ep 7) has this title, but checking if there's another with the same rating.\n\nWait, in row 6, the translation is about trust yourself and improvement, which we've already matched. The ratings for ep 9 and ep10 are both 14.5%. So the two episodes with that specific percentage are ep9 and ep10. \n\nBut does ep7 have a different rating? Ep7 has a rating of 15.6%, so it's not the same as 14.5%. Therefore, \"friendship or entrance final decision\" (ep10) has a rating of 14.5%, and the other part of the claim refers to another episode with the same rating.\n\nWait, actually, I think I might have misread. The claim says \"friendship or entrance exam final decision\" and that they have the same rating. So I need to find two episodes where both have the same percentage. From the table:\n\n- Ep9: \"trust yourself! your marks...\" with 14.5%\n- Ep10: \"friendship or entrance...\" with 14.5%\n\nSo these two episodes both have a rating of 14.5%, which matches the claim's second part.\n\nTherefore, both conditions in the claim are true:\n\n1. The episode with the translation \"trust yourself! your marks will surely improve\" exists.\n2. The episodes titled \"friendship or entrance exam final decision\" and another (ep9) have the same rating of 14.5%.\n\nHence, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\n- For the first part: ep9's row index is 6? Wait no, looking back at the data array:\n\nWait in the JSON provided, the data starts with \"ep2\" as index 0, so each subsequent entry increments. Let me recount the rows:\n\nRow indices:\n0: ep2\n1: ep3 (if exists)\nWait, actually, in the given data, it's a list of episodes starting from row 0 as the first episode, which is ep2? Or are these just arbitrary entries without specific numbering beyond their order.\n\nWait, looking at the 'translation of title':\n\nRow index 6 has \"Trust yourself! your marks...\" and row index7 has \"friendship or entrance...\".\n\nSo for the claim:\n\n- The relevant cells for the first part are row 6, column 'translation of title'.\n- For the second part, both row6 (since its rating is 14.5%) and row7 (rating 14.5%).\n\nBut wait, actually, the first part refers to one episode, and the second part refers to two episodes with the same rating.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- For \"trust yourself...\", it's row6.\n- For both having the same rating, we need both rows where the translation matches and their ratings. But looking again, only row7 has the specific title mentioned in the claim's second part, but to check if any other episode shares that rating.\n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify: The claim says \"friendship or entrance final decision have the same rating percent.\" So we need two episodes with that exact phrase? Or just one?\n\nActually, reading again, it seems the claim is stating that both \"trust yourself...\" and \"friendship or entrance...\" have the same ratings. Wait no\u2014the claim is structured as two separate points connected by 'and': 1) trust yourself..., and 2) friendship... and another (perhaps implied) have the same rating.\n\nBut upon closer look, the claim says: \"... and friendship or entrance final decision have the same rating percent.\" So it's one part talking about two episodes having the same rating. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjunction of two claims: both that \"trust yourself...\" exists and that \"friendship or entrance...\" and another have same ratings.\n\nBut given the structure, I think the claim is making two points:\n\n1. The episode with the title translation \"Trust yourself! your mark will surely improve\" exists.\n2. The episodes titled \"Friendship or entrance final decision\" and perhaps another (like \"entrance exam\") have the same rating percent.\n\nWait, but in the table, only one episode has that exact translation: row7's 'translation of title' is \"friendship or entrance exam final decision.\"\n\nSo for part two, does the claim mean that this specific episode shares its rating with another episode?\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Ep9 (row6) has a rating of 14.5%.\n- Ep10 (row7) also has 14.5%.\n\nTherefore, both have the same percentage. So the relevant cells would be row6's 'rating' and row7's 'rating'.\n\nSo compiling all:\n\n- The first part is supported by row6's translation column.\n- The second part is supported by row6 and row7's rating columns.\n\nThus, the claim holds TRUE because both conditions are satisfied: the specific episode exists, and two episodes share the same rating percent as mentioned in the claim.\n\nNow, compiling the relevant cells:\n\nFor \"Trust yourself!...\" \u2192 row index 6, 'translation of title'.\nFor the ratings \u2192 rows 6 and7 under 'rating' column.\n\nWait, but how is that structured? The JSON needs a list of objects with row indices and column names.\n\nSo each cell that supports the claim is:\n\n- For the first part: row6, 'translation of title'.\n- For the second part: both row6's rating and row7's rating, since they have the same 14.5%.\n\nHence, relevant_ cells would include these four points? Or perhaps just the necessary ones.\n\nWait, no\u2014each cell that is directly used to verify the claim. So:\n\n- The first part of the claim requires checking the 'translation of title' in row6.\n- The second part requires checking the 'rating' for row6 and row7 because both have 14.5%, which are equal.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be:\n\n{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"translation of title\"},\n{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"rating\"},\n{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"translation of title\"},\n{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"rating\"}\n\nBut wait, the claim doesn't mention row6's rating in the second part. It just says that friendship or entrance has same percent. So perhaps only checking their ratings.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again:\n\nThe claim is two separate assertions:\n\n1. An episode exists with translation \"Trust yourself! your mark will surely improve.\"\n   - This is found in row6's 'translation of title'.\n2. Two episodes (specifically the one mentioned and another) have the same rating.\n   - But the wording isn't clear on that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is:\n\n- Episode A exists with translation X.\n- Episodes B and C have the same rating.\n\nBut given the way it's written: \"...and friendship or entrance final decision have the same rating percent.\"\n\nSo it might be just stating that the specific episode (friendship...) has a certain rating. But in context, perhaps comparing to another.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is:\n\n- Episode X exists with translation Y.\n- Episode Z and W have the same percentage.\n\nBut given the wording, I think it's more about two separate facts: one about existence of an episode, and another about equality of ratings for two episodes. Thus, the relevant cells are row6's translation, row7's rating, and perhaps another.\n\nWait, maybe it's simpler:\n\nThe claim says:\n\n- \"You are tasked to find if a certain condition is met.\"\n\nBut according to the user message, they have provided all details needed.\n\nIn this case, I think the correct approach is:\n\n1. Identify that there is an episode with translation 'Trust yourself! your mark will surely improve.' \u2192 row6.\n2. Check that another episode (friendship or entrance...) has the same rating as perhaps a specific one.\n\nWait, maybe not\u2014perhaps it's about two episodes having the same rating regardless of others.\n\nBut given the wording: \"...and friendship or entrance final decision have the same rating percent.\"\n\nSo perhaps just checking that the episode with translation 'friendship...' has the same percentage as another (any other) episode. Or perhaps it's referring to itself and another, but I think in this context, since only one such episode exists, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is that both episodes mentioned have the same rating. But no, row6 is different from row7 in their translations.\n\nWait, no\u2014the translation for row6 is \"Trust yourself...\" and for row7 is \"Friendship or...\".\n\nThus, to confirm:\n\n- Episode A: translation X exists (row6).\n- Episodes B and C have same ratings (but which ones?).\n\nBut the claim doesn't specify. It might be that it's claiming that in general, two episodes with certain titles share a rating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second part is a separate condition about two specific episodes having same ratings.\n\nGiven ambiguity, but given the data:\n\nIf I proceed under the assumption that both parts need to be verified:\n\n- Existence of episode A (row6).\n- That there exists at least two episodes with same rating; or in this case, specifically, that row7's episode has a certain relation to another's rating.\n\nBut perhaps more straightforward: the claim is structured as two separate facts connected by 'and', so both must be true. So:\n\n1. There exists an episode with translation \"Trust yourself! your mark will surely improve.\" \u2192 yes (row6).\n2. The episodes named \"friendship or entrance final decision\" and another have same rating percent.\n\nBut in our data, only row7 has that exact translation. Unless the claim refers to two episodes: one is the trust episode, and the other is friendship, both having same ratings.\n\nThus:\n\n- Check if row6's rating equals row7's rating \u2192 yes, 14.5% for both.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would include row6's 'translation of title', row6's 'rating', row7's 'translation of title', and row7's 'rating'.\n\nHence, four cells in total.\n</think>\n\nTo address the task:\n\n1. Verify that an episode with the translation \"Trust yourself! your mark will surely improve.\" exists: This is found at row index 6 under 'translation of title'.\n2. Confirm that this episode (row6) and another episode (with translation \"Friendship or entrance final decision\" at row7) have the same rating percentage.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\n- The 'translation of title' for both episodes to confirm their existence.\n- Their respective ratings to check if they are equal.\n\nThus, the answer is structured as follows with the relevant cells highlighted.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"translation of title\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"translation of title\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"rating\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"rating\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"result\": true\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two episodes (plural) being broadcast in September. So I'm looking for any entries in the table where the broadcast date falls within September. The table has several columns: Unnamed: 0, episode title, romanized title, translation of title, broadcast date, and ratings. The relevant column here is \"broadcast date\".\n\nLooking at each row's broadcast date:\n\n- ep2: July 15, 2005\n- ep3: July 22, 2005\n- ep4: July 29, 2005\n- ep5: August 5, 2005\n- ep6: August 12, 2005\n- ep7: August 19, 2005\n- ep9: September 2, 2005\n- ep10: September 9, 2005\n\nSo I see two episodes (ep9 and ep10) that were broadcast in September. That means the claim is TRUE because there are exactly two episodes from that month.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells for each of these episodes. Each row has an index starting at 0. Ep9 is the 6th element in the data array (index 6), and ep10 is the 7th (index 7). The column we're interested in is \"broadcast date\".\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- For ep9: {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"broadcast date\"}\n- For ep10: {\"row_index\":7, \"column_name\":\"broadcast date\"}\n\nI need to list these two cells in the relevant_cells array.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a table in JSON format and a claim about the ratings of episodes. The claim is: \"Episode 9 has a higher rating than all other episodes.\" My task is to determine whether this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided.\n\nFirst, I'll need to look at the structure of the table. The columns are \"Unnamed: 0\", \"episode title\", \"romanized title\", \"translation of title\", \"broadcast date\", and \"ratings\". The relevant information for our claim will be in the \"episode title\" and \"ratings\" columns.\n\nI notice that the data provided includes episodes from ep2 to ep10, but there's a missing ep8. So, let me list out each episode along with its rating:\n\n- Episode 2: 16.5%\n- Episode 3: 13.8%\n- Episode 4: 16.1%\n- Episode 5: 16.8%\n- Episode 6: 17.9%\n- Episode 7: 15.6%\n- Episode 9: 14.5%\n- Episode 10: 14.5%\n\nWait, there's no ep8 in the data, so we'll ignore that for now.\n\nThe claim is about episode 9 having a higher rating than all others. Let me check the ratings:\n\nEpisode 9 has a rating of 14.5%. Now, I need to compare this with each other episode's rating:\n\n- Ep2: 16.5% \u2192 Higher than 14.5%\n- Ep3: 13.8% \u2192 Lower\n- Ep4: 16.1% \u2192 Higher\n- Ep5: 16.8% \u2192 Higher\n- Ep6: 17.9% \u2192 Higher\n- Ep7: 15.6% \u2192 Higher\n- Ep10: 14.5% \u2192 Equal\n\nSo, episode 9's rating is not higher than all others. There are several episodes with higher ratings (ep2, ep4, ep5, ep6, ep7) and one with the same rating (ep10). Therefore, the claim that episode 9 has a higher rating than all other episodes is FALSE.\n\nTo support this conclusion, I'll need to identify the relevant cells in the table. The relevant data includes each episode's \"ratings\" column because we're comparing their ratings. So, for each row from ep2 to ep10 (excluding ep8 which isn't present), the \"ratings\" cell is relevant.\n\nNow, compiling the list of relevant cells:\n\n- Row 0: Ep2 \u2192 Column \"ratings\"\n- Row 1: Ep3 \u2192 Column \"ratings\"\n- Row 2: Ep4 \u2192 Column \"ratings\"\n- Row 3: Ep5 \u2192 Column \"ratings\"\n- Row 4: Ep6 \u2192 Column \"ratings\"\n- Row 5: Ep7 \u2192 Column \"ratings\"\n- Row 6: Ep9 \u2192 Column \"ratings\"\n- Row 7: Ep10 \u2192 Column \"ratings\"\n\nThese cells show the ratings needed to evaluate whether ep9's rating is higher than all others. Since multiple episodes have higher or equal ratings, the claim doesn't hold.\n\nSo, the final answer should be FALSE with the relevant cells listed as above.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"dragon zakura be broadcast over 2 year\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the table structure, it has columns: Unnamed: 0 (which seems to be episode numbers), episode title, romanized title, translation of title, broadcast date, and ratings. The data spans from ep2 to ep10 with various titles and dates in 2005.\n\nThe claim mentions \"dragon zakura.\" I'm not immediately familiar with that term, but given the context, it might be a TV show or anime. However, looking at the table's episode titles, none of them mention \"dragon\" or \"zakura.\" The romanized and translated titles don't seem to match either. So perhaps \"Dragon Zakura\" is another name for this series? Or maybe it's related to the content.\n\nAssuming \"dragon zakura\" refers to the show in question, we can proceed. The next part of the claim is about broadcasting over two years. To verify this, I need to check the broadcast dates across episodes and see if they span more than one year.\n\nLooking at the broadcast dates in the table: the earliest is July 15, 2005 (ep2) and the latest is September 9, 2005 (ep10). All the episodes listed are within the same year, 2005. There's no data beyond that. So from the given information, all broadcasts occurred in 2005, which is less than a year apart.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014the table starts at ep2 and goes to ep10. What about earlier episodes? The claim might be referring to the entire series, not just these listed episodes. However, since the data provided doesn't include ep1 or beyond 2005, we can only go by what's here.\n\nSince all broadcast dates are in 2005, it doesn't cover two years. Therefore, the claim that \"dragon zakura be broadcast over 2 year\" is not supported by this table; it's false based on the given data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"Dragon Zakura\" was broadcast over two years. The table shows all episodes were aired in 2005, within a span of about four months. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Claim Components:** Determine if \"dragon zakura\" refers to the series in the table and whether its broadcasts lasted over two years.\n2. **Check Episode Broadcast Dates:** All listed episodes were broadcast between July 15, 2005, and September 9, 2005, which is less than a year.\n3. **Conclusion:** Since the broadcasts did not span two years, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"episode 3 be broadcast more than a week after episode 2\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the relevant columns in the table. The claim involves the broadcast dates of episodes 2 and 3, so I should check the \"broadcast date\" column for these two episodes.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n- Episode 2 (row index 0) has a broadcast date of July 15, 2005.\n- Episode 3 (row index 1) has a broadcast date of July 22, 2005.\n\nNow, I'll calculate the number of days between these two dates. From July 15 to July 22 is exactly one week, which is seven days. The claim states that episode 3 was broadcast \"more than a week\" after episode 2. Since one week is exactly seven days and not more than that, the broadcast of episode 3 wasn't more than a week later; it was exactly a week.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because episode 3 aired on July 22, which is exactly one week (seven days) after episode 2's broadcast on July 15. It doesn't meet the condition of being more than a week later.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
