    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"david frost be from united state\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by looking at the table structure and the data provided.\n\nThe table has columns: place, player, country, score, and to par. There are multiple rows of data. Each row represents a player's performance in some event, probably a golf tournament given the context like scores and players' names.\n\nThe claim is about David Frost being from the United States. To verify this, I need to look for the row where the player is David Frost and check his country.\n\nLooking at the data array:\n\n- The first row is Paul Azinger from the United States.\n- The second row is Nick Faldo from England.\n- The third row is David Frost from South Africa.\n- Then there are other players with their respective countries.\n\nSo, in the third row (index 2), under the player column, it's David Frost, and his country is listed as \"south africa\". \n\nTherefore, the claim says he's from the United States, but according to the table, he's from South Africa. That makes the claim false.\n\nI should note the relevant cells that support this conclusion. The row index for David Frost is 2 (since indexing starts at 0), and the column names are \"player\" and \"country\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that David Frost is from the United States, but according to the table, he's from South Africa.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
