    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the game at brunswick street oval be 1 of 2 games that have a crowd of 11000.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. The user is saying that among all the games listed in the table, there are two games with a crowd size of exactly 11,000 attendees. One of these games was played at brunswick street oval.\n\nLooking at the JSON data provided, each row represents a game with various details like home team, away team, venue, crowd, and date. The columns are \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", \"away team score\", \"venue\", \"crowd\", and \"date\". \n\nI need to check two things: \n1. How many games have a crowd of 11000?\n2. Among those, is the game at brunswick street oval counted as one?\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0:\n- Venue: glenferrie oval\n- Crowd: 4000\n\nNot relevant for our claim.\n\nRow 1:\n- Venue: brunswick street oval\n- Crowd: 11000\n\nThis is the first game at brunswick street oval with a crowd of 11,000. So this is one instance.\n\nRow 2:\n- Venue: punt road oval\n- Crowd: 11000\n\nAnother game with 11,000 attendees but not at brunswick street oval.\n\nRow 3:\n- Venue: corio oval\n- Crowd: 9000\n\nDoesn't match.\n\nRow 4:\n- Venue: windy hill\n- Crowd: 10000\n\nNope.\n\nRow 5:\n- Venue: lake oval\n- Crowd: 16000\n\nNot relevant.\n\nSo from this, I see that there are two games with a crowd of 11000. One is at brunswick street oval (row 1), and the other is at punt road oval (row 2). \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there are exactly two games with a crowd of 11000, one of which is at brunswick street oval.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells. The claim involves checking the \"crowd\" column for each game and verifying their venues. So I need to look at all rows where the crowd is 11000, which are rows 1 and 2. For each of these, I should note the \"venue\" as well.\n\nBut since the claim specifically mentions brunswick street oval, I can also focus on that row. However, to fully verify that there are exactly two games with a crowd of 11000, including the one at brunswick, I need to check all entries where crowd is 11000 and their venues.\n\nSo relevant cells would include:\n- Row 1: \"crowd\" (to confirm it's 11000)\n- Row 1: \"venue\" (to ensure it's brunswick street oval)\n- Row 2: \"crowd\" (another instance of 11000)\n- Optionally, row 2's venue to see if it's another location.\n\nIncluding all these cells ensures that we have verified both the crowd count and the venues. \n\nSo in terms of relevant_cells, I'll list each cell that contributes to this verification: rows 1 and 2 for the \"crowd\" column, and row 1 for the \"venue\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"footscray have an away team score 5.4 point lower than what collingwood have.\" \n\nFirst, let's parse the claim step by step. The key elements here are:\n\n1. Footscray's away team score.\n2. Collingwood's away team score.\n3. The difference between these two scores should be exactly 5.4 points.\n\nLooking at the table provided in JSON format, I need to find the rows where Footscray and Collingwood are listed as away teams because the claim refers to their \"away team\" scores.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Home team is Hawthorn, Away team is North Melbourne. Not relevant.\n- Row 1: Home team Fitzroy, Away St Kilda. Not relevant.\n- Row 2: Richmond vs Melbourne. Neither is Footscray or Collingwood.\n- Row 3: Geelong vs Footscray. So in this row, the away team is Footscray. Their score is \"3.5 (23)\". \n- Row 4: Essendon vs Collingwood. Here, Collingwood is the away team with a score of \"8.9 (57)\".\n- Row 5: South Melbourne vs Carlton. Not relevant.\n\nSo, from row 3, Footscray's away score is 23 points (since it's in parentheses). From row 4, Collingwood's away score is 57 points. \n\nNow, let's calculate the difference: 57 - 23 = 34 points. The claim says the difference should be 5.4 points lower for Footscray, meaning Footscray's score would be Collingwood's score minus 5.4. But according to my calculation, it's actually a much larger difference.\n\nWait, maybe I misread how the scores are presented. Let me check again: each team's score is in the format \"x.y (z)\", where z is the total points. So for Footscray, their away score is 23 points, and Collingwood's away score is 57 points.\n\nThe difference is indeed 57 - 23 = 34 points. The claim states that Footscray have a score 5.4 points lower than Collingwood's, which would mean Footscray has 57 - 5.4 = 51.6 points. That doesn't match the actual scores of 23 and 57.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the difference is much larger than stated.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are where Footscray and Collingwood's away team scores are listed. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the game at lake oval be the game with the largest crowd\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the table. The columns are: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. There are six rows of data.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific pieces of information: the venue \"lake oval\" and whether this game had the largest crowd. So I need to check both aspects.\n\nStarting with identifying which row corresponds to \"lake oval\". Looking through each row's venue column:\n\n1. Row 0: Glenferrie Oval\n2. Row 1: Brunswick Street Oval\n3. Row 2: Punt Road Oval\n4. Row 3: Corio Oval\n5. Row 4: Windy Hill\n6. Row 5: Lake Oval\n\nSo, the game at Lake Oval is in row index 5.\n\nNext, I need to check the crowd number for this game. In row 5, under the 'crowd' column, the value is 16000. Now, I should compare this with the other crowd numbers in all rows to see if it's indeed the largest.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: 4000\n- Row 1: 11000\n- Row 2: 11000\n- Row 3: 9000\n- Row 4: 10000\n- Row 5: 16000\n\nComparing all these, the crowd numbers are as follows:\n\nRow 5 has the highest number at 16,000. The next highest is row 1 and 2 with 11,000 each. Therefore, row 5's game at Lake Oval does have the largest crowd.\n\nTo ensure I'm thorough, let me confirm that no other games have a larger crowd than 16,000. Scanning through all rows again, none exceed this number.\n\nThus, the claim is supported: the game at Lake Oval has the largest crowd.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the game at Lake Oval had the largest crowd. By examining each row's 'crowd' value, we find that row 5 (Lake Oval) has the highest attendance of 16,000, which is larger than all other games.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It says that Carlton was NOT the away team in a game played at Windy Hill. So, my task is to check if in any row where the venue is \"windy hill,\" the away team is Carlton.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n- The columns are: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, date.\n- Each row represents a game played on 11 July 1931.\n\nI'll go through each row to find the one where the venue is \"windy hill.\"\n\nLooking at the data:\nRow 0: Venue is Glenferrie Oval\nRow 1: Venue is Brunswick Street Oval\nRow 2: Venue is Punt Road Oval\nRow 3: Venue is Corio Oval\nRow 4: Venue is Windy Hill\nRow 5: Venue is Lake Oval\n\nSo, the game at Windy Hill is in row 4. Now, checking the away team for that row.\n\nIn row 4:\n- Home team: Essendon\n- Away team: Collingwood\n\nThe away team here is Collingwood, not Carlton. Therefore, the claim that Carlton was not the away team at the Windy Hill game is correct because Carlton wasn't even playing in that particular game.\n\nWait a minute, actually, in row 5, the away team is Carlton, but that's at Lake Oval, not Windy Hill. So, the only game at Windy Hill had Collingwood as the away team. Thus, Carlton was indeed not the away team there.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Carlton was not the away team at Windy Hill.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"a total of 3 home team have a home team score higher than 10.00\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break down the steps.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that there are exactly three home teams whose scores exceed 10.00. I need to check each row in the table to see how many home teams meet this condition.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are \"home team\", \"home team score\", etc. So for each row, I'll look at the \"home team score\" column and determine if it's higher than 10.00.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Home team is Hawthorn with a score of \"14.12 (96)\". The format seems to be goals and behinds, then total points in parentheses. But the claim mentions \"higher than 10.00\", which I think refers to the numerical value before the decimal as goals. So 14 is higher than 10. This counts.\n\n2. **Row 1**: Fitzroy scored \"8.10 (58)\". The home team score here is 8, which is less than 10. Doesn't count.\n\n3. **Row 2**: Richmond's score is \"8.18 (66)\", so 8 goals again. Less than 10. Doesn't count.\n\n4. **Row 3**: Geelong has \"7.10 (52)\". 7 is below 10. Doesn't count.\n\n5. **Row 4**: Essendon's score is \"12.9 (81)\", which is 12 goals. That's above 10, so this counts.\n\n6. **Row 5**: South Melbourne scored \"10.12 (72)\". The claim says higher than 10.00, so exactly 10 doesn't qualify because it's not higher. It has to be more than 10. So this doesn't count either.\n\nNow, counting the home teams with scores over 10: Hawthorn and Essendon. That makes two teams, but the claim says three. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, did I miss any rows? Let me double-check:\n\n- Row 0: Yes (14)\n- Row 1: No (8)\n- Row 2: No (8)\n- Row 3: No (7)\n- Row 4: Yes (12)\n- Row 5: No (10)\n\nTotal is two, not three. So the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there are three home teams with scores over 10.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"brunswick street oval and glenferrie oval be the 2 venue that have game with a crowd of 11000\". Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns like \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", etc., and each row represents a different game on July 11, 1931. The claim is about two specific venues having games with a crowd of exactly 11000.\n\nSo, I'll go through each row in the data to check for these conditions:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Crowd = 11000:**\n   - Looking at the 'crowd' column (which is the fifth column), I need to find rows where the crowd is exactly 11000.\n   \n   Let's check each row:\n   - Row 0: Crowd is 4000. Not matching.\n   - Row 1: Crowd is 11000. Matches.\n   - Row 2: Crowd is 11000. Matches.\n   - Row 3: Crowd is 9000. Doesn't match.\n   - Row 4: Crowd is 10000. Doesn't match.\n   - Row 5: Crowd is 16000. Doesn't match.\n\nSo, rows 1 and 2 have a crowd of 11000 each.\n\n2. **Check the Venues for These Rows:**\n   Now, for these two rows, I'll check the venue (fourth column).\n   \n   - Row 1: Venue is \"brunswick street oval\".\n   - Row 2: Venue is \"punt road oval\".\n\nWait a second, the claim mentions \"glenferrie oval\" as one of the venues. But according to row 0, glenferrie oval had a crowd of 4000. So, it's not in the rows with 11000.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   The claim states that brunswick street oval and glenferrie oval are the two venues with a crowd of 11000 each. However, from the table:\n   - Brunwick street oval (row 1) has 11000.\n   - Glenferrie oval is in row 0 with only 4000.\n   - The other venue with 11000 is punt road oval, not glenferrie.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it incorrectly identifies glenferrie oval as having a crowd of 11000 when it actually had 4000. Instead, it's brunswick street oval and punt road oval that both have crowds of 11000.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because only brunswick street oval and punt road oval have games with a crowd of 11000.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"collingwood trail footscray in away team score\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should parse the claim correctly. The phrase seems a bit unclear, but I think it's saying that Collingwood trailed Footscray in terms of their away team scores. In other words, when Collingwood was the away team and played against someone else (maybe Footscray), their score was lower than Footscray's. Alternatively, maybe it's about a specific match where both were involved as home or away teams.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row has data for a game between a home team and an away team. The relevant columns here are \"home team\", \"away team\", \"away team score\", and \"home team score\".\n\nSo, let's go through each row to find any matches involving Collingwood as the away team or Footscray as the home team.\n\nRow 0: Hawthorn vs North Melbourne - Neither is Collingwood or Footscray. So irrelevant.\n\nRow 1: Fitzroy vs St Kilda - Again, neither is involved. Move on.\n\nRow 2: Richmond vs Melbourne - Still not relevant.\n\nRow 3: Geelong vs Footscray - Here's Footscray as the away team. The home team is Geelong. Their scores are 7.10 (52) for Geelong and 3.5 (23) for Footscray. So in this game, Footscray as the away team scored less than Geelong.\n\nRow 4: Essendon vs Collingwood - Here, Collingwood is the away team. Their score is 8.9 (57), while Essendon's home score is 12.9 (81). So Collingwood's score here as away was lower than Essendon's.\n\nRow 5: South Melbourne vs Carlton - Neither team is involved, so irrelevant.\n\nNow, the claim says Collingwood trailed Footscray in away team score. Wait, in which context? Because in row 3, Footscray is away against Geelong and lost. In row 4, Collingwood is away against Essendon and also lost. But I don't see a match where both Collingwood and Footscray are playing each other with either as the away team.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is that when Collingwood was an away team, they scored less than Footscray's away score in another game? Or maybe it's comparing their total scores across all games?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about a specific match where both are involved. Let me check if there's any row where Collingwood is the away team against Footscray or vice versa.\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\n- Row 3: Geelong (home) vs Footscray (away)\n- Row 4: Essendon (home) vs Collingwood (away)\n\nNo, there isn't a direct match between Collingwood and Footscray in the same row. So perhaps the claim is comparing their away scores across different games.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nCollingwood was an away team once, in row 4: scored 8.9 (57).\n\nFootscray was an away team in row 3: scored 3.5 (23). So, Collingwood's away score is higher than Footscray's away score.\n\nWait, the claim says \"collingwood trail footscray\", meaning Collingwood had a lower score as the away team compared to Footscray? But according to the data, Collingwood scored more when they were away (57) than Footscray did when they were away (23). So that would mean Collingwood didn't trail; instead, they outscored Footscray in their respective away games.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread. The claim could be about a specific match where both teams played each other, but as per the data, there's no such row.\n\nSo, perhaps the claim is false because there isn't a game where Collingwood trailed Footscray when Collingwood was the away team. Alternatively, if we consider their scores in different games, Collingwood scored higher than Footscray when both were away teams.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check all instances where Collingwood was an away team and see if they ever had a lower score than Footscray's home score or something else. Let me re-examine:\n\nIn row 4: Collingwood (away) vs Essendon (home). Collingwood's score is 57, which is less than Essendon's 81.\n\nBut the claim mentions \"trail footscray\", so perhaps comparing to Footscray's home or away scores. Since Footscray was an away team in row 3 with a lower score (23) than Collingwood's away score (57), it doesn't make sense that Collingwood trailed Footscray.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim is about Collingwood being the away team against Footscray, but such a match isn't present here. Therefore, the claim might be false because there's no evidence in the table of a game where Collingwood was an away team and Footscray was either home or away with a higher score.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the claim again: \"collingwood trail footscray in away team score\". So, Collingwood as the away team has a lower score than Footscray's away team score? But in row 4, Collingwood's away score is higher than Footscray's away score (57 vs 23). Therefore, Collingwood didn't trail.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about Collingwood being the away team and comparing to Footscray when they were home. Let's see: In row 4, Collingwood's away score is 57, while in another game (row 3), Footscray as away scored 23 against Geelong's home score of 52.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is that when Collingwood was an away team, they had a lower score than when Footscray was an away team. But no, Collingwood's away score is higher (57) than Footscray's away score (23). So that would mean Collingwood did not trail.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false based on the given data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Collingwood trailed Footscray in away team scores. However, upon examining the provided data:\n\n- **Collingwood** was an away team once, scoring 8.9 (57 points) against Essendon.\n- **Footscray** was an away team once, scoring 3.5 (23 points) against Geelong.\n\nSince Collingwood's away score (57) is higher than Footscray's away score (23), the claim that Collingwood trailed Footscray in away team scores is false.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is false because Collingwood's away score was higher than Footscray's.",

So I need to look at each row's \"crowd\" number and see which venues have the highest crowds. \n\nLooking through the data:\n- The first row has a crowd of 4000.\n- Second row: 11000\n- Third row: 11000\n- Fourth row: 9000\n- Fifth row: 10000\n- Sixth row (which is lake oval): 16000\n\nSo the crowd numbers are:\n4000, 11000, 11000, 9000, 10000, 16000.\n\nArranging these in descending order: 16000 (lake oval), 11000, 11000, 10000, 9000, 4000.\n\nWait, but there are two games with 11000. So the largest crowd is 16000 at lake oval. The next would be the highest of the remaining, which is 11000. But since there are two venues with 11000, does that mean lake oval isn't in second place?\n\nWait, the claim says \"second largest\". So the largest is 16000 (lake oval), but wait no\u2014that's actually the highest. If lake oval has the largest crowd, then the next would be the two venues with 11000 each. \n\nBut the claim says that lake oval has the second largest. That can't be right because lake oval is actually the first place. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait no, let me recount:\n\nThe crowd numbers are:\nRow 0: 4000\nRow 1: 11000\nRow 2: 11000\nRow 3: 9000\nRow 4: 10000\nRow 5 (lake oval): 16000\n\nSo the order is:\n1. 16000 (lake oval)\n2. 11000 (rows 1 and 2)\n3. 11000 again\n4. 10000\n5. 9000\n6. 4000\n\nSo the largest crowd is at lake oval with 16000, which is first place. The second largest would be the next highest, which is 11000. However, both row 1 and row 2 have 11000.\n\nWait a minute, so lake oval isn't in second place; it's actually in first. So the claim says that lake oval has the second largest crowd, but according to this, they're number one. Therefore, the claim is false because lake oval has the highest crowd, not the second.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread something. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at row 5 (index starting from 0?), no, in the data array, it's index 5: \"south melbourne\" vs \"carlton\", venue is lake oval, crowd is 16000. So yes, that's the highest.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because lake oval actually has the largest crowd, not second.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Lake Oval had the game with the second-largest crowd, but according to the data, it was the venue with the largest crowd. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:** The claim refers to \"crowd\" numbers at different venues.\n2. **Extract Crowd Data:**\n   - Row 0: 4000\n   - Row 1: 11000\n   - Row 2: 11000\n   - Row 3: 9000\n   - Row 4: 10000\n   - Row 5 (Lake Oval): 16000\n3. **Determine Order of Crowds:**\n   - Largest: 16000 (Row 5, Lake Oval)\n   - Next largest: 11000 (Rows 1 and 2)\n4. **Evaluate Claim:** The claim says Lake Oval is second, but it's actually first.\n5. **Conclusion:** The claim is false.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"carlton be the home team at the windy hill game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It says Carlton was the home team in a game held at Windy Hill. So I'm looking for two things: the venue being Windy Hill and whether Carlton is listed as the home team there.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has \"home team\", \"away team\", and \"venue\" columns. The relevant rows are those where the venue is Windy Hill.\n\nChecking the data:\n\n- Row 0: Venue is Glenferrie Oval.\n- Row 1: Brunswick Street Oval.\n- Row 2: Punt Road Oval.\n- Row 3: Corio Oval.\n- Row 4: Windy Hill.\n- Row 5: Lake Oval.\n\nSo only row 4 has the venue as Windy Hill. Now, checking who the home team is in that row. The \"home team\" column for row 4 shows Essendon. Carlton is listed under \"away team\".\n\nTherefore, Carlton was not the home team at the Windy Hill game; they were the away team.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row 4's \"venue\" to confirm it's Windy Hill.\n- Row 4's \"home team\" to check if it's Carlton or not.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine whether the claim \"2 - third of home team have score higher than 10.0\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I'll look at what the table contains. The table has seven columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. There are six rows of data, each representing a game played on July 11, 1931.\n\nThe claim mentions that two-thirds of the home teams have a score higher than 10.0. So, I need to check how many home teams scored more than 10 points and see if that number is at least two-thirds of six, which would be four out of six.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Hawthorn (home team) scored 14.12 (96). The score here is 96, which is way above 10. So, this counts as a home team with a higher score.\n2. Fitzroy (home team) scored 8.10 (58), totaling 58 points. That's also above 10. Another one to count.\n3. Richmond (home team) has 8.18 (66). Again, 66 is more than 10. Third home team over the threshold.\n4. Geelong scored 7.10 (52), which is still above 10. Fourth home team meets the condition.\n5. Essendon's score is 12.9 (81), definitely higher than 10. That's five out of six so far.\n6. South Melbourne has 10.12 (72). 72 points, which is also above 10.\n\nWait a minute, that means all six home teams have scores higher than 10. So, two-thirds would be four, but here it's actually all six. Therefore, the claim holds true because more than two-thirds meet the condition.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check each row to make sure I didn't miss anything:\n\n- Hawthorn: 96 > 10 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Fitzroy: 58 > 10 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Richmond: 66 > 10 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Geelong: 52 > 10 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Essendon: 81 > 10 \u2714\ufe0f\n- South Melbourne: 72 > 10 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all six home teams scored above 10. So two-thirds (which is four) are definitely met. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
