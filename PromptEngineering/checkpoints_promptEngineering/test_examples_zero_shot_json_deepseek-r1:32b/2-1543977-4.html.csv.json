    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if the claim \"santiago luna miguel angel martin be the runner up behind tiger wood in 1999\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components. The claim states that Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin were the runners-up behind Tiger Woods in 1999. So I need to verify two main things: who was the runner-up in 1999, and whether Tiger Woods was the individual associated with them.\n\nLooking at the table's structure, it has columns for year, country, team, individual, location, and runners-up. Each row represents a different year from 1993 to 1999. I'm particularly interested in the 1999 entry.\n\nIn the data array, the first row (index 0) corresponds to 1999. Let me examine that row:\n\n- Year: 1999\n- Country: united states\n- Team: mark o' meara & tiger woods\n- Individual: tiger woods\n- Location: kuala lumpur , malaysia\n- Runners-up: santiago luna & miguel angel martin\n\nFrom this, I can see that in 1999, Tiger Woods was the individual. The runners-up listed are Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin. This directly supports the claim because it shows that both were indeed the runners-up behind Tiger Woods in that year.\n\nSo, all parts of the claim are correctly represented in the table. There's a match for the year, the individual (Tiger Woods), and the runners-up as specified.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the 1999 entry in the table lists Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin as the runners-up behind Tiger Woods.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"runners - up\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"individual\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"tiger wood have only win 1 year\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that Tiger Woods has won only once in a single year.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year from 1993 to 1999. The relevant columns here are \"year\" and \"individual\", which I assume lists the winner for that particular year.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- For 1999 (row index 0), the individual is Tiger Woods.\n- In 1998 (row index 1), the individual is Scott Verplank, not Tiger.\n- In 1997 (row index 2), the winner is Colin Montgomerie again, so no Tiger there.\n- Moving to 1996 (row index 3), Ernie Els is the individual winner.\n- For 1995 (row index 4) and 1994 (row index 5), Davis Love III and Fred Couples are the winners respectively. Still, no Tiger Woods.\n- Finally, in 1993 (row index 6), Bernhard Langer is listed as the individual.\n\nFrom this analysis, I see that Tiger Woods only appears once in the \"individual\" column under the year 1999. Therefore, the claim that he has won only one year seems accurate based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Tiger Woods won only one year, and according to the table, he is listed as the individual winner for the year 1999. No other entries show him as a winner in different years.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"individual\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the tournament be first hold in cape town in 1996\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. The key points here are:\n- The tournament was held in Cape Town.\n- This was the first time it was held there.\n- The year mentioned is 1996.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the relevant columns would be \"year\" and \"location\". Each row represents a different year's data, so I need to check if Cape Town appears as a location in any of these rows, particularly focusing on 1996.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- **Row 0 (1999)**: Location is Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Not Cape Town.\n- **Row 1 (1998)**: Location is Auckland, New Zealand. Not Cape Town.\n- **Row 2 (1997)**: Location is Kiawah Island, South Carolina, USA. Not Cape Town.\n- **Row 3 (1996)**: Location is Cape Town, South Africa. This matches the claim's location and year.\n- **Rows 4 to 6**: Years 1995 to 1993 have locations in China, Puerto Rico, and Florida respectively\u2014none are Cape Town.\n\nSo, the first occurrence of Cape Town as a location is indeed in 1996. There are no earlier entries with Cape Town before that year in this table. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The data spans from 1993 to 1999.\n\nThe claim mentions the year 1997 and two individuals: Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin as the runner-ups behind Tiger Woods.\n\nI'll start by locating the row for the year 1997 in the table. Scanning through each data entry, I find that in the third row (index 2), the year is 1997. The individual listed here is Colin Montgomerie, and the runners-up are Colin Montgomerie & Raymond Russell.\n\nThe claim specifies Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin as the runners-up, but according to the table, neither of these names appear in the 1997 row's \"runners-up\" column. Instead, the runners-up that year were different individuals. \n\nTherefore, the information in the claim does not match the data provided in the table for the specified year and individuals. This leads me to conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\nAdditionally, checking other rows for 1997 doesn't provide any relevant information since there's only one entry for that year.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"runners-up\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim \"tiger wood have win several year\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table structure. It has columns: year, country, team, individual, location, and runners-up. The data spans from 1993 to 1999 with various entries for each category.\n\nThe claim mentions \"tiger wood have win several year.\" This seems to suggest that Tiger Woods won multiple times over the years. So I need to check how many times Tiger Woods is listed as the winner in this table.\n\nLooking at the 'individual' column, which lists the individual winners each year:\n- 1999: tiger woods\n- 1998: scott verplank\n- 1997: colin montgomerie\n- 1996: ernie els\n- 1995: davis love iii\n- 1994: fred couples\n- 1993: bernhard langer\n\nFrom this, Tiger Woods only appears once in the 'individual' column for the year 1999. There's no other occurrence of his name as an individual winner.\n\nAdditionally, checking the 'team' column:\n- 1999: mark o'meara & tiger woods\n- Other years don't list him as part of a team winning individually.\n\nSo, Tiger Woods won once in 1999. The claim suggests he has won several (more than one) times over multiple years. Since the table only shows him winning once, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is evaluated based on Tiger Woods' appearances as an individual winner in the table. He appears only once in 1999, so the claim of multiple wins is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"individual\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the tournament be first hold in cape town in 1998\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that the tournament was first held in Cape Town in 1998. So I'm looking for two things: the year 1998 and the location being Cape Town.\n\nLooking at the table, it has columns like \"year\", \"country\", \"team\", \"individual\", \"location\", and \"runners - up\". The relevant columns here are \"year\" and \"location\".\n\nI'll start by checking each row's year to see if 1998 is present. Scanning through:\n\n- Row 0: 1999\n- Row 1: 1998\n- Row 2: 1997\n- Row 3: 1996\n- Row 4: 1995\n- Row 5: 1994\n- Row 6: 1993\n\nSo, the claim mentions 1998, which is in row index 1. Now, let's check the location for that year.\n\nIn row 1, the \"location\" column says \"auckland, new zealand\". Hmm, so Cape Town isn't mentioned here. Wait a second, I remember seeing Cape Town in another row. Let me double-check all rows:\n\n- Row 0: Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\n- Row 1: Auckland, New Zealand\n- Row 2: Kiawah Island, South Carolina, USA\n- Row 3: Cape Town, South Africa\n- Rows 4 to 6: Shenzhen, China; Dorado, Puerto Rico; Orlando, Florida, USA\n\nAh, yes. Cape Town is listed in row index 3 with the year 1996. So according to the table, the tournament was held in Cape Town in 1996, not 1998.\n\nWait, but the claim says it was first held in Cape Town in 1998. That would mean that before 1998, it wasn't held there. However, looking at row 3 (year 1996), Cape Town is already a location. So if 1996 has Cape Town as the location, then 1998 can't be the first time.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the tournament was first held in Cape Town in 1998 is incorrect because it actually happened two years earlier in 1996.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the tournament was first held in Cape Town in 1998. Checking the table:\n\n- In row index 3 (year 1996), the location is Cape Town, South Africa.\n\nSince Cape Town appears before 1998, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
