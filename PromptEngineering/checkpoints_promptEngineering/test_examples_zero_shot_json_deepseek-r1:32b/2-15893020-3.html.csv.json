    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"average be 0.1 for deon kruis\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the data rows to find Deon Kruis. Scanning the player names, I see Deon Kruis is in row index 16 (since counting starts at 0). Let me confirm: the first row is 0, so the 17th row would be index 16.\n\nLooking at that row, the columns are \"player\", \"matches\", \"innings\", \"not out\", \"runs\", \"high score\", \"average\", \"strike rate\", and \"100s\". So for Deon Kruis, I need to check the \"average\" value.\n\nIn the data array, the 17th element (row index 16) shows his average as \"n / a\". Hmm, that's not a numerical value. The claim says the average is 0.1. Since the table indicates it's \"n/a\", which probably means 'not applicable' or missing data, there's no numerical average provided.\n\nTherefore, there's no support for an average of 0.1 in the table. So the claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Deon Kruis has an average of 0.1. Checking the table, under Deon Kruis' row, the \"average\" column shows \"n/a\", meaning there's no numerical value provided to support this claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 16,\n       \"column_name\": \"average\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",
