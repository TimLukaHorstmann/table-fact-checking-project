    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table in JSON format. The claim is: \"In the 1987 - 88 season, Newell's Old Boy scored 55 points.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse the data structure provided. The table has columns: team, average, points, played, and three seasons: '1986 - 87', '1987 - 88', '1988 - 89'. Each row represents a different team with their corresponding statistics.\n\nMy goal is to find the row for \"newell's old boys\" and check what their points were in the '1987 - 88' season. \n\nLooking at the data array, I'll go through each row until I find the one where the team name matches \"newell's old boys\". Scanning through:\n\nRow index 0: Independent\nRow index 1: newell's old boys \u2013 that's the one.\n\nNow, in this row, I need to check two things: their points and their performance in '1987 - 88'. Let's look at the columns. The \"points\" column is third (index 2), but wait, no\u2014the columns are ordered as team, average, points, played, then each season. So the columns after that are specific seasons.\n\nWait, let me clarify: \n\nColumns order:\n0 - team\n1 - average\n2 - points\n3 - played\n4 - '1986 - 87'\n5 - '1987 - 88'\n6 - '1988 - 89'\n\nSo for \"newell's old boys\" (row index 1), the points column is at index 2, which shows 136. But the claim mentions their score in a specific season, so maybe it refers to that season's performance rather than total points.\n\nWait, I'm confused. The 'points' column is their overall points across all seasons or just for one? No, probably each season has separate data. Let me check the columns again.\n\nThe table structure is such that after \"played\", there are three columns representing each season: 1986-87, 1987-88, and 1988-89. So for each team, they have their points in each of those seasons listed under these columns.\n\nSo the claim is about the '1987 - 88' season. Therefore, I need to look at column 5 (since it's zero-indexed: 0=team, 1=avg, 2=pts, 3=played, 4='86-87', 5='87-88', 6='88-89').\n\nSo in row index 1, column 5 (which is the '1987 - 88' season), what's the value? Looking at the data: \n\nRow 1 has data as follows:\n[\"newell 's old boys\", \"53.04\", \"136\", \"26\", \"47\", \"55\", \"34\"]\n\nSo for the '1987 - 88' season, their points are 55.\n\nWait, but the claim says they scored 55 points in that season. So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, another thought: does the \"points\" column (column 2) represent total points across all seasons? If so, then the value is 136, which doesn't match 55. But the claim is about a specific season, not the overall points.\n\nSo I think in this context, each of the three columns after 'played' represents the points for that respective season. Therefore, looking at column 5 (index 5) gives us 55 points for '1987 - 88'.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Newell's Old Boys scored 55 points in the 1987-88 season. By examining row index 1 (Newell's Old Boys) and column '1987 - 88', we find the value is indeed 55.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"1987 - 88\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"114 be play when point be 107 and when 1987 - 88 be 31\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim means. The claim has two conditions connected by \"and,\" which means both must be true for the entire statement to be TRUE. If either condition isn't met, then the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe first part is \"114 be play when point be 107.\" I think this translates to: For rows where the points are 107, does the 'played' column equal 114? \n\nLooking at the table, the columns we have are team, average, points, played, and then three years (1986-87, etc.). So, I need to find any row where points is exactly 107. Let me scan through each row's points value.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- Independiente: 139\n- Newell's Old Boys: 136\n- San Lorenzo: 135\n- Racing Club: 132\n- Boca Juniors: 130\n- River Plate: 130\n- Rosario Central: 123\n- Deportivo Espa\u00f1ol: 122\n- Gimnasia de la Plata: 116\n- V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield: 115\n- Estudiantes de La Plata: 111\n- Argentinos Juniors: 110\n- Talleres de C\u00f3rdoba: 109\n- Ferro Carril Oeste: 107\n\nOh, here we go. The 14th row (index starting at 0) is \"ferro carril oeste\" with points 107. Now, checking the 'played' column for this row. It's 114. So the first condition holds because when points are 107, played is indeed 114.\n\nNext, the second part: \"when 1987 - 88 be 31.\" This means we need to check if there's a row where the value under the '1987-88' column is 31. Let me look through each row's 1987-88 values.\n\nLooking at each row:\n- Independiente: 47\n- Newell's Old Boys: n/a (wait, no, actually looking back, the table shows for 'ferro carril oeste' as 31 in '1987 - 88'? Wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, I might be confusing rows. Let me list out all the '1987-88' values:\n\nRow 0: Independiente: 47\nRow 1: Newell's Old Boys: n/a? Or is it 31? No, looking back at the table data provided, each row under '1987 - 88' varies. Let me check each one.\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\n0: 47\n1: (Newell's) maybe not present? Wait, no, in the data, for row 1, it's \"n/a\" perhaps? Or is it a different number?\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nThe table's '1987 - 88' column for each team:\n\nIndependiente: 47\nNewell's Old Boys: n/a (or maybe another value)\nSan Lorenzo: ?\nRacing Club: ?\n\nWait, actually, perhaps I should parse the data correctly. Let me list out all rows and their '1987 - 88' values.\n\nRow indices:\n\n0: Independiente: 47\n1: Newell's Old Boys: n/a? Or is it a number? Wait, looking at the data provided, each row under '1987 - 88' seems to have specific numbers except for some which might be \"n/a.\" Let me check:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: 47\nRow 1: Not sure, but perhaps I should look back. Actually, in the data provided, each row has '1986 - 87', '1987 - 88', etc., with some being \"n/a.\" Let me go through all rows:\n\nRow 0: Independiente: 47 (for 1987-88)\nRow 1: Newell's Old Boys: n/a? Or is it a number? Wait, in the data provided, I think row 1 has '1986 - 87' as \"n/a\" but maybe not. Let me check each row:\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the data more carefully.\n\nLooking back, for each team:\n\nIndependiente: [47, ...]\nNewell's Old Boys: I think their '1987-88' is n/a? Or maybe it's 31? No, perhaps not. Let me check all rows again.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the data provided, for example:\n\n- For \"ferro carril oeste\" (row index 14), the '1987 - 88' value is 31.\n\nYes! So row index 14 has '1987 - 88' as 31. Now, let's check the other condition for this row: points and played.\n\nLooking at row index 14: \"ferro carril oeste\" has points 107, played 114, which matches the first condition. So in this same row, '1987 - 88' is 31. \n\nSo both conditions are met in the same row (row index 14). Therefore, the claim holds true because there exists a team where points are 107 and played is 114, and also the same team has '1987-88' as 31.\n\nWait, but actually, I need to check if both conditions are met in the same row. Let me verify:\n\nIn row index 14: points = 107, played = 114, '1987 - 88' = 31. Yes, all three values exist in this row.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are satisfied by this single row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because there's a row where points are 107 and played is 114, and in the same row, '1987-88' is 31.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"1987 - 88\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
