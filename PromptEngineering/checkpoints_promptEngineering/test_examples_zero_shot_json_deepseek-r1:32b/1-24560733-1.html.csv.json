    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the wildcat keep the oppose team scoreless in 4 game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim means. It suggests that in four games, the opponent's score was zero points. So, looking at each row of data, I should check where \"opponents\" column has a value of 0.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 1: Opponents scored 14\n- Row 2: Opponents scored 0 \u2192 This counts as one game.\n- Row 3: Opponents scored 7\n- Row 4: Opponents scored 0 \u2192 Second game.\n- Row 5: Opponents scored 0 \u2192 Third game.\n- Row 6: Opponents scored 6\n- Row 7: Opponents scored 13\n- Row 8: Opponents scored 6\n- Row 9: Opponents scored 0 \u2192 Fourth game.\n- Row 10: Opponents scored 13\n\nSo, there are four instances where the opponent's score is zero. Each of these corresponds to rows 2, 4, 5, and 9.\n\nNow, I need to verify each relevant cell:\n\nRow 2 (index starts at 0? Wait, in the data array, it's index 1 since JSON arrays are zero-based. But looking back, the table has 10 entries starting from game 1 to game 10. So for the claim, rows where opponents' score is 0:\n\n- Game 2: row index 1\n- Game 4: row index 3\n- Game 5: row index 4\n- Game 9: row index 8\n\nWait, no. Let's recount properly.\n\nLooking at the data array:\n\nEach sub-array represents a game from 1 to 10.\n\nSo the indexes in the JSON data are zero-based:\n\nRow 0: game 1 \u2192 opponents scored 14 (no)\nRow 1: game 2 \u2192 0 (yes)\nRow 2: game3\u21927 (no)\nRow3: game4\u21920(yes)\nRow4:game5\u21920(yes)\nRow5:game6\u21926(no)\nRow6:game7\u219213(no)\nRow7:game8\u21926(no)\nRow8:game9\u21920(yes)\nRow9:game10\u219213(no)\n\nSo, rows with opponents' score 0 are row indices 1,3,4,8. That's four games. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, collect all relevant cells for each of these rows in the \"opponents\" column.\n\nThus, the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 1, column \"opponents\"\n- Row 3, column \"opponents\"\n- Row 4, column \"opponents\"\n- Row 8, column \"opponents\"\n\nSo the JSON should list these four cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the wildcat never score more than 7 in any game they lose\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the table represents. The columns are: game number, date, opponent, result (win or loss), Wildcats points, opponents' points, and record. So for each game played, we have details about whether they won or lost, how many points they scored, their opponents, etc.\n\nThe claim is that whenever the Wildcats lose a game, their score never exceeds 7 points. To verify this, I need to look at all the games where the result was a loss and check the \"Wildcats points\" in those games.\n\nLooking through the data:\n\n- Game 1: Result is a loss, Wildcats scored 7 points.\n- Game 7: Result is a loss, Wildcats scored 0 points.\n- Game 10: Result is a loss, Wildcats scored 6 points.\n\nSo there are three games where they lost. In each of these cases, their score was 7, 0, or 6 points. All of these are less than or equal to 7. Therefore, the claim seems to hold true based on this data.\n\nI don't see any other losses in the table besides these three. So all relevant cells are from rows where the result is a loss and the column \"Wildcats points\". These would be row indices 0, 6, and 9.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Wildcats never scored more than 7 points in any lost game. Checking each loss:\n\n- Game 1: 7 points (exactly 7)\n- Game 7: 0 points\n- Game 10: 6 points\n\nAll are \u22647, so the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The columns are: game, date, opponent, result, wildcats points, opponents, record. Each row represents a game with details like the date it was played, whether they won or lost, and other stats.\n\nThe claim mentions two things:\n1. They lost 1 game in September.\n2. They lost 2 games in November.\n\nI'll go through each month separately.\n\nStarting with September (rows where the date starts with \"sept\"). Looking at the data:\n\nRow 0: Sept 20, result is \"loss\" \u2192 This is a loss in September. So that's one loss.\nAre there any other rows for September? Row 1 is Sept 27, but the result there is a win. So only one loss in September.\n\nNext, November (rows where the date starts with \"nov\"). Checking each row:\n\nRow 6: Nov 1 \u2192 result is \"loss\" \u2192 First November loss.\nRow 8: Nov 15 \u2192 result is \"win\".\nRow 9: Nov 22 \u2192 result is \"loss\" \u2192 Second November loss.\n\nSo in November, there are two losses.\n\nPutting it together, the claim states they lost 1 game in September (which is correct) and 2 games in November (also correct). Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\nFor September's loss:\n- Row 0 has \"result\" as \"loss\".\nSo row_index 0, column_name \"result\".\n\nFor November's losses:\n- Row 6: result is \"loss\"\n- Row 9: result is \"loss\"\n\nWait, but looking back at the data, Row 6 is Nov 1 (loss), and Row 9 is Nov 22 (another loss). So two relevant cells in November.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- row 0, column \"result\" for September's loss.\n- row 6, column \"result\"\n- row 9, column \"result\"\n\nBut wait, in the initial analysis, I thought Row 6 was Nov 1 (loss) and Row 9 was Nov 22 (another loss). So that makes two November losses.\n\nTherefore, all three cells are relevant to support the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the wildcat play 2 game in september, 4 game in october, and 4 game in november.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each month mentioned: September, October, November.\n\nStarting with September:\n- Checking the 'date' column for entries that fall in September.\n- Rows 0 (sept 20) and 1 (sept 27) are in September. So, there are 2 games in September. That matches the claim.\n\nNext, October:\n- Looking at dates from oct 4 to oct 31.\n- The rows for October are index 2 (oct 4), 3 (oct 11), 4 (oct 18), and 5 (oct 25). That's four games.

The columns are: game, date, opponent, result, wildcats points, opponents, record. So each row represents a game played by the Wildcats against another team, with various details about that game.\n\nThe claim is talking about the maximum point difference where the Wildcats outscored their opponents by 36 points. To verify this, I need to look at each game and calculate the point difference between the Wildcats and their opponents.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. Game 1: Sept 20 vs Ole Miss - Wildcats scored 7, Opponent scored 14. The result is a loss. So the difference is 7-14 = -7 points.\n2. Game 2: Sept 27 vs Cincinnati - Wildcats 20, Opponent 0. Difference is +20. Result was a win.\n3. Game 3: Oct 4 vs Xavier - Wildcats 20, Opponent 7. Difference +13. Win again.\n4. Game 4: Oct 11 vs 9 Georgia - Wildcats 26, Opponent 0. Difference +26. Another win.\n5. Game 5: Oct 18 vs 10 Vanderbilt - Wildcats 14, Opponent 0. Difference +14. Win.\n6. Game 6: Oct 25 vs Michigan State - Wildcats 7, Opponent 6. Difference +1. Win.\n7. Game 7: Nov 1 vs 18 Alabama - Wildcats 0, Opponent 13. Difference -13. Loss.\n8. Game 8: Nov 8 vs West Virginia - Wildcats 15, Opponent 6. Difference +9. Win.\n9. Game 9: Nov 15 vs Evansville - Wildcats 36, Opponent 0. Difference +36. This looks like a big win.\n10. Game 10: Nov 22 vs Tennessee - Wildcats 6, Opponent 13. Difference -7. Loss.\n\nFrom this breakdown, the highest point difference where the Wildcats outscored their opponents is in Game 9, where they scored 36 points against Evansville who scored 0. The difference here is 36-0 = +36 points, which matches the claim exactly.\n\nSo the relevant cells are the \"wildcats points\" and \"opponents\" columns for row 8 (since indexing starts at 0, so game 9 is row index 8) because that's where the maximum point difference occurs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the wildcat keep the oppose team scoreless in 10 game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that in all 10 games, the opponent didn't score any points against the Wildcats. So I need to check each of the 10 games and see if the opponents' scores are zero in every case.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant columns here would be \"opponent\" (to identify the opposing teams) and \"opponents\" which shows their scores. The \"wildcats points\" column shows our team's score, but that might not be necessary unless we need to cross-verify something else.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Game 1**: Opponent is Ole Miss. Their score is 14. That's definitely more than zero.\n2. **Game 2**: Opponent is Cincinnati. They scored 0 points. So this game supports the claim.\n3. **Game 3**: Xavier scored 7 points. Again, not zero.\n4. **Game 4**: 9 Georgia scored 0 points. This game also fits.\n5. **Game 5**: 10 Vanderbilt scored 0 points.\n6. **Game 6**: Michigan State scored 6 points. Not zero.\n7. **Game 7**: 18 Alabama scored 13 points.\n8. **Game 8**: West Virginia scored 6 points.\n9. **Game 9**: Evansville scored 0 points.\n10. **Game 10**: Tennessee scored 13 points.\n\nSo from this, I can see that not all games have the opponent's score as zero. In fact, in several games (like Game 1, Game 3, Game 6, Game 7, Game 8, and Game 10), the opponents did score. Therefore, the claim isn't true for all 10 games.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check. The claim says \"keep the oppose team scoreless in 10 game.\" Maybe I miscounted or missed some rows where opponents didn't score? Let me go through again quickly:\n\n- Game 2: Opponent score 0\n- Game 4: 0\n- Game 5: 0\n- Game 9: 0\n\nSo that's four games where the opponent scored zero. The rest, they did score. Therefore, the claim is false because it wasn't true for all 10 games.\n\nI should also note the relevant cells in the table to support this conclusion. Each row has an \"opponents\" column which shows their scores. So I'll list each row's index and mark the \"opponents\" column as relevant since that directly relates to whether they scored or not.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- The claim is FALSE because not all 10 games had opponents scoring zero.\n- Relevant cells are every row under the \"opponents\" column since we checked each one.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It states that whenever the Wildcats won a game, their score didn't exceed 7 points. So, I need to check each row where the result was a \"win\" and see if their points were more than 7 in any of those games.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the relevant columns are \"result\" (to identify wins) and \"wildcats points\" (to check the score). \n\nLet me go through each data row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Result is \"loss\". Doesn't affect the claim.\n2. **Row 1**: Result is \"win\". Wildcats scored 20 points. This is more than 7, which would make the claim false if this is a win with higher points.\n3. **Row 2**: Result is \"win\". Score is 20 again. Same as above.\n4. **Row 3**: Result is \"win\". Score is 26. Again, way over 7.\n5. **Row 4**: Result is \"win\". Score is 14. Also higher than 7.\n6. **Row 5**: Result is \"win\". Score is 7. This matches the claim's limit.\n7. **Row 6**: Result is \"loss\". Irrelevant.\n8. **Row 7**: Result is \"win\". Score is 15, which is over 7.\n9. **Row 8**: Result is \"win\". Score is 36, way higher.\n10. **Row 9**: Result is \"loss\". Doesn't matter.\n\nFrom rows 1 to 4 and 7-8, the Wildcats won games with scores exceeding 7 points. Specifically, in row 5, they scored exactly 7 points, which fits the claim, but since there are other wins where they scored more than 7, the overall claim is false.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are all the \"wildcats points\" columns for rows where the result was a win.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"the wildcat loss 1 game in november and 2 game in september.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It seems to be saying that the Wildcats lost one game in November and two games in September.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are columns like 'date', 'result', and others. The relevant information will likely come from the 'date' and 'result' columns. \n\nI'll start by examining all rows where the result is a loss because that's what the claim is about. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Date is \"sept 20\", Result is \"loss\". So, this counts as one loss in September.\n2. **Row 7**: Date is \"nov 1\", Result is \"loss\". This is a loss in November.\n3. **Row 9**: Date is \"nov 22\", Result is \"loss\". Another loss in November.\n\nWait, that's three losses\u2014two in November and one in September? Or am I miscounting?\n\nLet me recount the months:\n\n- September: Only row 0 has a date in September (\"sept 20\") with a result of loss. So, only 1 loss in September.\n- October: Rows 3,4,5 have results as wins, so no losses here.\n- November: Rows 7 and 9 have \"loss\" results. That's two losses in November.\n\nWait, but row 6 is also in November (\"nov 8\"), and the result was a win, so it doesn't count towards the loss.\n\nSo, according to this, there's one loss in September (row 0) and two losses in November (rows 7 and 9). \n\nBut the claim says \"1 game in november and 2 games in september.\" Wait, that's the opposite of what I found. The claim states 1 loss in November and 2 in September, but from the table, it's actually 1 loss in September and 2 losses in November.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it swaps the number of losses between the two months.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that there were 2 losses in September and 1 in November. The table shows only 1 loss in September and 2 losses in November.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - Look for rows where 'result' is \"loss\".\n\n2. **Check Dates:**\n   - Row 0: Date is \"sept 20\" \u2192 Loss in September.\n   - Row 7: Date is \"nov 1\" \u2192 Loss in November.\n   - Row 9: Date is \"nov 22\" \u2192 Loss in November.\n\n3. **Count Losses by Month:**\n   - September: 1 loss (Row 0).\n   - November: 2 losses (Rows 7 and 9).\n\n4. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - Claim states 2 losses in September and 1 in November.\n   - Actual data shows 1 loss in September and 2 in November.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim is false because the number of losses in each month does not match the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine if the claim \"the wildcat play 4 games in September, 2 games in October, and 2 games in November\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are game number, date, opponent, result, Wildcats points, opponents' points, and record. So, each row represents a game played by the Wildcats. \n\nThe claim specifies the number of games in each month: 4 in September, 2 in October, and 2 in November. My task is to check how many games were played each month as per the table.\n\nLooking at the 'date' column for each game:\n\n1. Game 1: sept 20 \u2192 September\n2. Game 2: sept 27 \u2192 September\n3. Game 3: oct 4 \u2192 October\n4. Game 4: oct 11 \u2192 October\n5. Game 5: oct 18 \u2192 October (Wait, this is actually the third game in October)\n6. Game 6: oct 25 \u2192 October (Fourth game in October)\n7. Game 7: nov 1 \u2192 November\n8. Game 8: nov 8 \u2192 November\n9. Game 9: nov 15 \u2192 November (Third game in November)\n10. Game 10: nov 22 \u2192 November (Fourth game in November)\n\nWait a minute, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount:\n\n- September games are rows 0 and 1 (sept 20 and sept 27). So that's 2 games in September.\n- October has rows 2 to 5: oct 4, oct 11, oct 18, oct 25. That's four games in October.\n- November includes rows 6 to 9: nov 1, nov 8, nov 15, nov 22. So that's four games in November.\n\nBut the claim states 4 in September, which contradicts our count of only 2 games there. Similarly, it says 2 in October and November, but according to the table, October has 4 games and November also has 4 games. Therefore, the claim is incorrect on all counts.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the most the wildcat outscore an opponent be by 26 point",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the most the wildcat outscore an opponent be by 26 point\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that the maximum points by which the Wildcats outscored their opponents was 26 points. To verify this, I need to look at each game and calculate the difference between the Wildcats' points and their opponents' points for each row where the result was a win. Because if it's a loss or a tie, they didn't outscore the opponent.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are 10 rows of data. Each row has columns: game, date, opponent, result, wildcats points, opponents, record. The relevant columns here will be \"result\", \"wildcats points\", and \"opponents\".\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\nRow 0:\n- Game 1 vs Ole Miss\n- Result: loss\nSo they didn't outscore; the difference is negative (7 -14 = -7). So this doesn't count.\n\nRow 1:\n- Game 2 vs Cincinnati\n- Result: win\nWildcats points: 20, Opponents: 0. Difference is 20 -0 = 20. This is a significant outscore.\n\nRow 2:\n- Game 3 vs Xavier\n- Result: win\nPoints: 20, Opponents:7. Difference is 13.\n\nRow3:\n- Game4 vs 9 Georgia\n- Result:win\nWildcats points:26, Opponents:0. Difference is 26. That's a big margin.\n\nRow4:\n- Game5 vs 10 Vanderbilt\n- Result: win\nPoints:14, Opponents:0. Difference is 14.\n\nRow5:\n- Game6 vs Michigan State\n- Result:win\nPoints:7, Opponents:6. Difference is 1.\n\nRow6:\n- Game7 vs 18 Alabama\n- Result:loss\nSo they didn't outscore; difference is negative (0 -13 = -13). Not relevant.\n\nRow7:\n- Game8 vs West Virginia\n- Result:win\nPoints:15, Opponents:6. Difference is 9.\n\nRow8:\n- Game9 vs Evansville\n- Result:win\nPoints:36, Opponents:0. Wait, this looks like a really high score. The difference would be 36 -0 =36 points. That's higher than 26.\n\nWait, so hold on, in row8 (index starting at 0, so row index 8), the Wildcats scored 36 and opponents 0. So the outscore is 36 points, which is more than 26.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check because in row3, they had a difference of 26. But if row8 has a higher difference, then the claim that the maximum was 26 would be false.\n\nWait, but looking at row4: Game5 vs Vanderbilt, Wildcats have 14 points, opponents 0. So 14-0=14.\n\nRow9:\n- Game10 vs Tennessee\n- Result: loss\nSo they didn't outscore; difference is negative (6 -13 =-7). Not relevant.\n\nWait, but in row8 (index 8), it's game9, and the opponent is Evansville. Wildcats points are 36, opponents 0. So that's a 36-point margin. That's higher than 26.\n\nSo according to this, the maximum outscore was 36, not 26. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because it's stating the most was 26, but in reality, they had a game where they outscored by 36 points.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't misread any rows. Let's list all the wins:\n\nRow1: 20-0 = +20\nRow2:20-7=+13\nRow3:26-0=+26\nRow4:14-0=+14\nRow5:7-6=+1\nRow7:15-6=+9\nRow8:36-0=+36\n\nSo the maximum is indeed 36, which means the claim of 26 being the most is incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\nFor row1 (index 1): \"result\" and \"wildcats points\", \"opponents\"\nRow2: same\nRow3: shows a 26-0 difference, so it's part of the data but not the maximum.\nRow4: 14-0\nRow5:7-6\nRow7:15-6=9\nRow8:36-0=36 which is higher than 26.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells to check are all rows where result was a win, but specifically looking at row3 and row8 because they have the highest margins. But since the claim says the maximum was 26, but in reality it's 36, we need to highlight the cell where the difference is higher than claimed.\n\nSo the relevant cells would include:\n\n- For each game that resulted in a win, check \"wildcats points\" and \"opponents\". Specifically, row8 (index8) has the highest difference of 36. So the claim is FALSE because there's a higher margin elsewhere.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the maximum outscore by Wildcats was 26 points. Upon reviewing all games where they won, the highest margin was actually 36 points against Evansville. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": {\n    \"text\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"The claim that the maximum outscore by Wildcats was 26 points is incorrect because in one game they outscored by 36 points.\"\n  }\n}\n```",
