    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"only 1 of the song from the remix dead guy remix be not in 2003\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems a bit unclear because of possible typos, so maybe it's supposed to say \"only one song from the 'dead guy remix' is not in 2003.\" Alternatively, perhaps it means that among the remixes labeled \"dead guys remix,\" only one song is from a year other than 2003. I'll proceed with this interpretation.\n\nLooking at the table's structure: The columns are year, artist, song, album, and remix. Each row represents a different song entry. The claim focuses on the 'remix' column, specifically entries that have \"dead guys remix\" or similar, and checks how many of them are not from 2003.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Year is 2003, remix is \"dead guys remix.\" So this fits\u2014both year is 2003 and remix type.\nRow 1: Same as above. Year 2003, remix same.\nRow 2: Again, 2003 and \"dead guys remix.\"\nRow 3: Here, the year is 2005, and remix is still \"dead guys remix.\" So this song is a 'dead guys remix' but not from 2003. That's one instance.\nRow 4: Year is 2010, remix is \"dee-lux remix\" (different from \"dead guys\"). So this doesn't count towards the claim since it's a different remix type.\nRow 5: Year is 2010, remix is also \"dee-lux remix.\" Again, not relevant because it's a different remix.\n\nSo, out of all rows where the remix is \"dead guys remix,\" how many are not in 2003? Rows 0-2 are from 2003. Row 3 is 2005 with that remix. Rows 4 and 5 have a different remix type, so they don't factor into this claim.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"only 1 of the song from the remix dead guy remix be not in 2003.\" So according to my analysis, there's only one such song (row 3) that is a 'dead guys remix' and not from 2003. Rows 4 and 5 have different remixes, so they don't count.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be TRUE because exactly one song with 'dead guys remix' isn't from 2003.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells: I need to find all rows where the remix is \"dead guys remix\" and check their years. So for each such row, I look at both the 'remix' and 'year' columns.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow 0: remix is \"dead guys remix,\" year is 2003.\nRelevant cells: (0, 'remix') and (0, 'year')\nRow 1: same as above. So cells (1, 'remix'), (1, 'year').\nRow 2: same. Cells (2, 'remix'), (2, 'year').\nRow 3: remix is \"dead guys remix,\" year is 2005. Cells (3, 'remix') and (3, 'year').\n\nRows 4 and 5 have different remixes, so they don't affect the count for this claim.\n\nSo the relevant cells are all rows where remix is \"dead guys remix\" across columns 'remix' and 'year', which are rows 0-3 for both those columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that only one song from the \"dead guys remix\" is not in 2003. From the table, we see that three songs (rows 0-2) with \"dead guys remix\" are from 2003, and one song (row 3) is from 2005. Thus, the claim holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"remix\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"remix\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"remix\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"remix\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 1 single song that be produce after 2003 that do not have an album title list\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says there's exactly one song produced after the year 2003 that doesn't have an album listed. So, I'm looking for entries where the 'year' is greater than 2003 and the 'album' field isn't a valid title\u2014it might be \"n/a\" or empty.\n\nLooking at the table data:\n\n- The first four rows are from 2003. Since the claim specifies after 2003, I can ignore these.\n- Rows 4 and 5 are from 2010, which is after 2003. Let's examine each of these.\n\nRow 4: Artist is \"pixie lott\", song is \"turn it up\", album is \"turn it up\". So the album is listed, meaning this doesn't fit the claim because we're looking for a song without an album title.\n\nRow 5: Artist is \"perry mystique\", song is \"party like ur 18 feat sway\", and album is \"n/a\". This indicates that there's no album title listed. So this row meets both conditions: it's after 2003, and the album isn't listed.\n\nNow, checking if there's exactly one such entry. The table only has two entries after 2003 (rows 4 and 5), and only row 5 fits the criteria. Therefore, there is indeed 1 single song that meets all the conditions stated in the claim.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE. I'll need to list the relevant cells which are the 'year' and 'album' columns for row index 5.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because there's exactly one song after 2003 without an album title listed.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"album\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the year 2005 be the only ear that do not have multiple song",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says: \"the year 2005 be the only ear that do not have multiple song.\" Hmm, I think there might be a typo here; it should probably say \"year\" instead of \"ear.\" So, the intended meaning is likely that 2005 is the only year where there's only one song, and all other years have multiple songs.\n\nFirst, let me look at the table provided. The columns are year, artist, song, album, remix. There are six rows in total, each representing a different song entry.\n\nLet me list out the years and count how many songs each has:\n\n1. 2003: Let's see. Row 0 is blondie with \"good boys.\" Then row 1 is chicane with \"locking down,\" and row 2 is lamb with \"wonder.\" So, that's three songs in 2003.\n\nWait, no, actually, each row represents one song, but the same year can appear multiple times. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: 2003\nRow 1: 2003\nRow 2: 2003\nRow 3: 2005\nRow 4: 2010\nRow 5: 2010\n\nSo, grouping by year:\n\n- 2003: Rows 0,1,2 \u2192 3 songs.\n- 2005: Row 3 \u2192 1 song.\n- 2010: Rows 4,5 \u2192 2 songs.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the only ear that do not have multiple song.\" So, does that mean 2005 is the only year with exactly one song? Let's check:\n\n- 2003 has three songs. That's more than one.\n- 2005 has one song.\n- 2010 has two songs.\n\nSo, according to this, both 2005 and 2010 have only a single occurrence each? Wait no: 2005 appears once (row 3), 2010 appears twice (rows 4 and 5). So, the count for each year is:\n\n- 2003: 3 songs\n- 2005: 1 song\n- 2010: 2 songs\n\nSo, only 2005 has a single song. The other years (2003 and 2010) have multiple songs.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. Each row is one song entry, so the number of rows per year indicates how many songs were released that year. So:\n\n- 2003: three songs\n- 2005: one song\n- 2010: two songs\n\nSo yes, 2005 is the only year with a single song. Therefore, the claim seems to be true because it's stating that 2005 is the only year without multiple songs.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The claim says \"the year 2005 be the only ear that do not have multiple song.\" So, does that mean all other years have multiple songs? Let's see:\n\n- 2003 has three songs: yes, multiple.\n- 2010 has two songs: also multiple.\n\nSo yes, all years except 2005 have multiple songs. Therefore, the claim is correct.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells, I need to identify which cells are used to determine this. For each year, we look at how many times it appears in the \"year\" column. So for each row, if the year is 2003, 2005, or 2010, we count them.\n\nSo, all rows contribute because each has a year entry. The relevant cells are every cell in the 'year' column across all six rows. That way, I can tally how many times each year appears and verify that only 2005 appears once.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because 2005 is the only year with one song, while other years have multiple.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the song from dee  - lux remix be preform by different artist but the song be all from the same year.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down what this means. So, the key points are:\n\n1. Songs that have a \"dee-lux remix.\"\n2. These songs should be performed by different artists.\n3. All these songs should come from the same year.\n\nLooking at the table, let's find all entries where the remix is \"dee-lux remix.\" Scanning through the data, I see two rows:\n\nRow 4: Pixie Lott with \"Turn It Up\" (remix by dee-lux)\nRow 5: Perry Mystique with \"Party Like Ur 18 feat.

It seems like it's saying that out of all the songs remixed by \"dee-lux\", only one of them isn't from the year 2005.\n\nLooking at the table, let's identify which rows have \"dee-lux remix\" in the 'remix' column. Scanning through each row:\n\nRow 4: Dee-lux remix? Yes, and the year is 2010.\nRow 5: Dee-lux remix? Yes, and the year is also 2010.\n\nSo there are two songs with \"dee-lux remix\". Now, checking their years: both are from 2010. The claim says only one of them isn't in 2005. But actually, none of the dee-lux remixed songs are from 2005; they're all from 2010.\n\nWait a second, maybe I misread. Let me double-check:\n\nRow indices start at 0. Rows 4 and 5 have 'dee-lux remix'. Both years are 2010. So both are not in 2005.

Let's start by understanding what the claim is saying. It\u2019s asserting that in the year 2003, there are the same number of songs listed as in 2005.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it has columns: year, artist, song, album, and remix. The data spans from 2003 to 2010 with various entries. My task is to count how many songs were released in each of these years and compare them.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row and note the year and the corresponding song entry. Let's list out all the rows:\n\nRow 0: Year 2003, Song \"good boys\"\nRow 1: Year 2003, Song \"locking down\"\nRow 2: Year 2003, Song \"wonder\"\nRow 3: Year 2005, Song \"can' t resist\"\nRow 4: Year 2010, Song \"turn it up\"\nRow 5: Year 2010, Song \"party like ur 18 feat sway\"\n\nNow, let's count the number of songs for each year mentioned in the claim (2003 and 2005).\n\nFor 2003:\n- Rows 0, 1, 2 all have the year 2003. Each row represents a different song, so that's three songs.\n\nFor 2005:\n- Only Row 3 has the year 2005, which is one song.\n\nComparing these counts: 3 songs in 2003 vs. 1 song in 2005. Clearly, they are not equal. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nTo ensure I'm accurate, let me double-check each row:\n\n- Year 2003 has entries at rows 0, 1, and 2. That's three distinct songs.\n- Year 2005 only appears once at row 3.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"only 1 of the artist list from the dee - lux remix have the name of a state.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It mentions artists associated with the \"dee - lux remix\" and whether only one of them has a name that's also a state.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant columns are \"artist\" and \"remix\". The rows where the remix is \"dee - lux remix\" are the ones we need to focus on. Let me check each row:\n\n- Row 4: Artist is \"pixie lott\", Remix is \"dee - lux remix\"\n- Row 5: Artist is \"perry mystique\", Remix is \"dee - lux remix\"\n\nSo there are two artists with the \"dee - lux remix\": pixie lott and perry mystique.\n\nNow, I need to determine if any of these artist names correspond to a state in the United States. Let's think about each one:\n\n1. Pixie Lott: That's a person's name, specifically an English singer. Not a state.\n2. Perry Mystique: That doesn't ring a bell as a state either.\n\nWait, but looking at row 5 again, the artist is \"perry mystique\". I'm trying to think if \"Perry\" is a state or part of one. Hmm, Perry isn't a U.S. state. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the claim refers to the song title or album name? But no, the claim specifically mentions the artist list.\n\nWait another thought: Texas is a state. Oh, but in row 4, the remix is \"dead guys remix\", not \"dee - lux remix\". So Texas isn't part of the dee-lux remix artists. Therefore, among the two artists with dee-lux remix (pixie lott and perry mystique), neither has a name that's a state.\n\nWait, but hold on: Is \"perry\" perhaps referencing something else? Or maybe \"mystique\" isn't relevant. No, I think not. So according to this, there are zero artists with the name of a state in the dee-lux remix list. But the claim says only 1 does.\n\nWait, did I miss any rows? Let me double-check:\n\nRows with \"dee - lux remix\":\n- Row 4: pixie lott\n- Row 5: perry mystique\n\nNo others. So both are not states. Thus, the number is zero, not one. Therefore, the claim that only 1 artist from the dee-lux remix has a state name is FALSE.\n\nBut wait another angle: Could \"Texas\" be considered as part of any other remix? No, Texas is in row 4 with \"dead guys remix\". So it's irrelevant for the dee-lux remix artists.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the claim is FALSE because none of the artists under the dee-lux remix have state names, not one.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that only one artist from the \"dee - lux remix\" has a name of a state. Checking the table, the relevant rows are 4 and 5 where the remix is \"dee - lux remix\". The artists in these rows are \"pixie lott\" and \"perry mystique\", neither of which corresponds to a U.S. state. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"artist\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"there be 1 single artist that be produce after 2005 that have an album title list\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It seems a bit archaic in wording, so I'll try to translate it into more standard English: \"Is there exactly one artist who produced something after 2005 and has an album listed?\"\n\nLooking at the table columns: year, artist, song, album, remix.\n\nSo, I need to find artists whose entries are from years after 2005 (i.e., 2006 or later) and check if they have a valid album title in the 'album' column.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Year 2003 \u2013 too early, ignore.\n2. Row 1: Year 2003 \u2013 same as above.\n3. Row 2: Year 2003 \u2013 same.\n4. Row 3: Year 2005 \u2013 exactly 2005. The claim is \"after\" 2005, so this doesn't count.\n5. Row 4: Year 2010 \u2013 after 2005. Album title is \"turn it up\". So this artist (Pixie Lott) qualifies.\n6. Row 5: Year 2010 \u2013 also after 2005. Album title is \"n/a\" which likely means not applicable or no album listed.\n\nSo, looking at rows 4 and 5:\n\n- Row 4 has a valid album title, so that's one artist (Pixie Lott).\n- Row 5's album is \"n/a\", which I assume doesn't count as having an album title.\n\nWait, the claim says \"that have an album title list.\" So perhaps it means the album field isn't empty or something. Since row 4 has a valid album and row 5 doesn't, only Pixie Lott fits.\n\nBut wait, let's check if there are any other artists after 2005 with a listed album.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Only rows 4 and 5 are after 2005. Row 4 has an album, row 5 does not. So only one artist meets the criteria: Pixie Lott.\n\nWait no, hold on: The claim says \"1 single artist\" that produces after 2005 with an album listed. From our data, that's exactly one artist (Pixie Lott). Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nBut wait, in row 4, the artist is Pixie Lott and the song is Turn It Up. The album title is \"turn it up\" \u2013 same as the song name, but that still counts as an album.\n\nRow 5: Perry Mystique's album is n/a, so doesn't count.\n\nSo only one artist meets all conditions: produced after 2005 and has a listed album (even if it's just the same as the song).\n\nThus, the answer should be TRUE. The relevant cells are row 4, columns 'year', 'artist', and 'album'.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"artist\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"album\"}]}",

I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the song from the dee  - lux remix be perform by the same art and the song be from different year.\" Hmm, there might be some typos here, but I think it means that two songs remixed by \"dee - lux remix\" are performed by the same artist and come from different years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a song with details like year, artist, song name, album, and remix. The claim mentions \"dee  - lux remix,\" which appears in rows 4 and 5 (indices starting at 0). \n\nRow 4: Artist is \"pixie lott\" from year 2010.\nRow 5: Artist is \"perry mystique\" also from year 2010.\n\nWait, both these songs are remixed by \"dee - lux remix,\" but they are performed by different artists\u2014\"pixie lott\" and \"perry mystique.\" Additionally, both are from the same year, 2010. \n\nThe claim states that the songs should be from different years and performed by the same artist. However, in reality, the two relevant rows have different artists and the same year.
