    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim \"only 1 fighter have a 5 - 3 record\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that there's exactly one fighter in the dataset with a record of 5 wins and 3 losses. So, my task is to check each row in the table to see how many fighters have this specific record.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the relevant columns are \"record\" and maybe \"opponent\", but since the claim is about the record, I'll focus on that. Each row represents a fight result for a fighter against an opponent, so the \"record\" column shows the fighter's overall win-loss record up to that point.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: The record is \"6 - 4 (1)\". This doesn't match 5-3.\n2. **Row 1**: Record is \"5 - 4 (1)\". Still not 5-3.\n3. **Row 2**: Here, the record is \"5 - 3 (1)\". This matches the claim exactly. So, this fighter has a 5-3 record.\n4. **Row 3**: The record is \"5 - 2 (1)\", which doesn't match.\n5. **Row 4**: Record is \"4 - 2 (1)\". Not matching.\n6. **Row 5**: Shows \"3 - 2 (1)\". Doesn't fit.\n7. **Row 6**: This one has a record of \"3 - 1 (1)\", which again doesn't match.\n8. **Row 7**: Record is \"3 - 1\". Still not 5-3.\n9. **Row 8**: The fighter here has a \"2 - 0\" record, so no match.\n10. **Row 9**: Record is \"1 - 0\", doesn't fit.\n\nAfter reviewing all the rows, I found that only Row 2 has a record of \"5 - 3 (1)\". This means there's exactly one fighter with that specific record. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table data in JSON format. The claim states: \"when the opponent be dan severn , the method be submission (arm triangle choke) and the event be ufc japan : ultimate japan\". \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components. We need to check three things:\n1. The opponent is Dan Severn.\n2. The method used was a submission via arm triangle choke.\n3. The event was UFC Japan: Ultimate Japan.\n\nI'll go through each row in the data to see if any of them match all these conditions.\n\nLooking at the table's data, there are 11 rows. I'll check each one step by step.\n\nRow 0:\n- Opponent is Johnathan Ivey. Not Dan Severn. So this doesn't apply.\n\nRow 1:\n- Opponent is Wes Sims. Again, not Dan Severn.\n\nRow 2:\n- Opponent is Dan Severn. This matches the first condition.\n- Now, check the method: Submission (arm triangle choke). Yes, that's correct.\n- Next, event name: WEF 9 - World Class. The claim says it should be UFC Japan: Ultimate Japan. So this doesn't match.\n\nRow 3:\n- Opponent is Maurice Smith. Not Dan Severn.\n\nRow 4:\n- Opponent is Patrick Smith. No match.\n\nRow 5:\n- Opponent is Kazushi Sakuraba. Not our target.\n\nRow 6:\n- Opponent is Kazushi Sakuraba again. Still not Dan Severn.\n\nRow 7:\n- Opponent is Maurice Smith. Doesn't fit.\n\nRow 8:\n- Opponent is Carl Franks. No match.\n\nRow 9:\n- Opponent is Victor Tatarkin. Not relevant.\n\nRow 10:\n- Opponent is Gary Myers. No.\n\nSo, the only row where the opponent is Dan Severn is Row 2. But in that case, the event was WEF 9 - World Class, not UFC Japan: Ultimate Japan. Therefore, all three conditions aren't met in any single row. \n\nWait a minute\u2014am I missing something? Let me double-check for other rows where the opponent might be Dan Severn or if there's another row that I overlooked.\n\nGoing back, Row 2 is the only one with Dan Severn as the opponent. The event doesn't match, so the claim isn't fully supported.\n\nTherefore, since there's no row where all three conditions (opponent is Dan Severn, method is submission via arm triangle choke, and event is UFC Japan: Ultimate Japan) are met simultaneously, the claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that when the opponent was Dan Severn, the method was a submission by arm triangle choke and the event was UFC Japan: Ultimate Japan. Checking each row, only Row 2 has Dan Severn as the opponent. However, in this case, the event is WEF 9 - World Class, not UFC Japan: Ultimate Japan. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
