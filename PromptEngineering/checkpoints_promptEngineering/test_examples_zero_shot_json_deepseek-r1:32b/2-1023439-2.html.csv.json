    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"during 1986, 6 be the value for us dance when the value of us r&b be 9.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what this means. It's saying that in the year 1986, if the US R&B value is 9, then the US Dance value should be 6.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has columns: year, title, us, us r&b, and us dance. The data rows are as follows:\n\nRow 0: 1984, \"pretty mess\", 75, 15, 13\nRow 1: 1985, \"mechanical emotion\", 107, 23, -\nRow 2: 1986, \"under the influence\", 56, 9, 6\nRow 3: 1986, \"animals\", -, -, -\nRow 4: 1988, \"undress\", -, -, -\n\nSo, I need to find all rows where the year is 1986. There are two such rows: row index 2 and row index 3.\n\nIn row 2, the US R&B value is 9 and the US Dance value is 6. That matches exactly what the claim states. \n\nNow, looking at row 3, which also has the year 1986, but both US R&B and US Dance are \"-\", meaning there's no data available. However, since the claim specifies that when US R&B is 9, then US Dance should be 6, we only need to check rows where US R&B is 9. \n\nSince row 2 meets this condition and has the correct US Dance value of 6, the claim holds true for at least one relevant entry. The presence of other entries with \"-\" doesn't affect the validity of the claim because it's conditional on US R&B being 9.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are in row index 2 for both \"us r&b\" and \"us dance\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that during 1986, when US R&B is 9, US Dance should be 6. Checking the table, in row index 2, year 1986 has US R&B as 9 and US Dance as 6, confirming the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us r&b\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"under the influence chart at 56 in the us in 1985 and 1986.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse this claim correctly. It seems like it's saying that the title \"Under the Influence\" charted at position 56 in the US charts for both 1985 and 1986.\n\nLooking at the table, let me check each year mentioned: 1985 and 1986.\n\nFor 1985, I scan through the data rows. The first row is 1984, so that's not it. The second row has year 1985 with the title \"Mechanical Emotion.\" Under the US column (which I assume stands for the US chart), the value is 107. So in 1985, the only entry is for \"Mechanical Emotion\" at position 107. There's no entry for \"Under the Influence\" in 1985.\n\nNow checking 1986: I see two entries with that year. The third row has \"Under the Influence\" and a US chart value of 56. That matches part of the claim for 1986. But the fourth row is another entry from 1986 titled \"Animals,\" which has all \"-\" in its columns, meaning no data or chart position.\n\nSo the claim says it charted at 56 in both years. From the table, there's only an entry for 1986 with that title and position. There's no corresponding entry for 1985. Therefore, the claim is not fully supported because while \"Under the Influence\" did chart at 56 in 1986, it didn't do so in 1985.\n\nSo I'll mark this as FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
