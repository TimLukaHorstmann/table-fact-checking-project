Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for Ireland in the data. Scanning through the list of nations, I see that Ireland is present as a row in the table. Next, I need to check the medals they have. The columns are nation, gold, silver, bronze, and total.\n\nLooking at Ireland's row, under 'gold' it shows 0, which means no gold medals. Under 'silver', there's 1 medal. Now, checking 'bronze', it also shows 0. So Ireland has exactly one silver medal and no other types of medals. \n\nTherefore, the claim is accurate because Ireland only has that single silver medal with no others.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 43, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 43, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 43, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
