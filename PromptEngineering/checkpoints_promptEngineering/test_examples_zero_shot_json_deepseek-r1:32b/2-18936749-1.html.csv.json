    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim \"in the northern state conference (ihsaa), Bremen have a higher enrollment than Culver Community\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table contains. It has columns: school (IHSAA ID), location, mascot, enrollment, IHSAA class, county, and year joined. The data includes several schools with their respective details.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific schools: Bremen and Culver Community. So, my first step is to locate these two in the table. Looking at the \"school (ihsaa id)\" column:\n\n- Bremen is in row 0.\n- Culver Community is in row 1.\n\nNext, I need to check their enrollments because the claim compares their sizes based on enrollment numbers.\n\nFor Bremen (row 0), the enrollment number is listed as 505. For Culver Community (row 1), the enrollment is 306. \n\nComparing these two: 505 (Bremen) is indeed higher than 306 (Culver Community). Therefore, the claim that Bremen has a higher enrollment than Culver Community is supported by the data in the table.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider if there's any other relevant information. The mention of \"northern state conference\" isn't directly addressed in the table columns provided. However, since both schools are listed under the same conference (though not explicitly stated here), or perhaps it's implied through their IHSAA class and county, but given the data, the enrollment comparison is sufficient to evaluate the claim.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Bremen has an enrollment of 505, Culver Community has 306. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim compares the enrollments of Bremen and Culver Community in the IHSAA Northern State Conference. Checking their respective rows, Bremen's enrollment (505) exceeds Culver's (306), making the statement true.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"in the northern state conference (ihsaa), bremen join 12 year after culver community\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the relevant parts of the claim. The claim mentions two schools: Bremen and Culver Community. It says that Bremen joined 12 years after Culver Community in the Northern State Conference (IHSAA). \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a school with various details, including the year they joined. So I need to find the rows for both Bremen and Culver Community.\n\nIn the data array, the first row is about Bremen. The columns are: \"school (ihsaa id)\", \"location\", \"mascot\", \"enrollment\", \"ihsaa class\", \"county\", \"year joined\". So I should look at the last element of each row for the year they joined.\n\nBremen's row is index 0, and under \"year joined\" it says 1989. Culver Community's row is index 1, with a \"year joined\" of 1977.\n\nNow, to find out how many years apart their joining was, I subtract the earlier year from the later one: 1989 - 1977 = 12 years. So Bremen did join exactly 12 years after Culver Community.\n\nI should also consider if they are in the same conference, as the claim mentions \"northern state conference (ihsaa)\". However, the table doesn't provide information about conferences, only the year each school joined IHSAA. Since the claim specifies IHSAA and not a specific conference within it, I think the focus is on their joining years.\n\nTherefore, based on the data provided, Bremen did join 12 years after Culver Community. So the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"In the Northern State Conference (IHSAA), Bremen is in a different IHSAA class than Culver Community.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what the table contains. It's about various schools with details like school name, location, mascot, enrollment, IHSAA class, county, and year joined.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific schools: Bremen and Culver Community. It says that they are in different IHSAA classes within the Northern State Conference. So my task is to check their IHSAA classes from the table.\n\nLooking at the table data:\n\n- For Bremen (row 0), under \"IHSAA class\" it's listed as \"aa\".\n- For Culver Community (row 1), under \"IHSAA class\" it's listed as \"a\".\n\nSo, Bremen is in AA and Culver is in A. Since these are different classes, the claim seems to be true.\n\nBut wait, I should also make sure that both schools belong to the Northern State Conference. The table doesn't have a column explicitly stating which conference each school is part of. It only mentions their county and year joined but not the conference.\n\nHowever, in real-world context, if they're both listed under the same data source or section related to the Northern State Conference, it might be implied that they are part of that conference. But strictly from the given table, there's no direct information about conferences. \n\nBut since the claim is specific to the Northern State Conference (IHSAA), I have to assume that both schools are in this conference because otherwise, comparing their classes wouldn't make sense. The question focuses on their IHSAA class, so maybe the conference detail isn't necessary for verifying the class difference.\n\nGiven that, focusing back: Bremen is AA and Culver is A. Different classes, so the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Bremen and Culver Community are in different IHSAA classes within the Northern State Conference. From the table, Bremen is in class \"aa\" and Culver is in class \"a\", which confirms they are in different classes.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"ihsaa class\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ihsaa class\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It mentions two schools: Laville and Jimtown. The claim is about their enrollments in the context of the Northern State Conference under IHSAA.\n\nLooking at the table columns: \"school (ihsaa id)\", \"location\", \"mascot\", \"enrollment\", \"ihsaa class\", \"county\", and \"year joined\". \n\nI need to find the enrollment numbers for both Laville and Jimtown. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Bremen, enrollment 505\n- Row 1: Culver Community, enrollment 306\n- Row 2: Glenn, enrollment 613\n- Row 3: Jimtown, enrollment 642\n- Row 4: Knox Community, enrollment 632\n- Row 5: Laville, enrollment 413\n- Row 6: New Prairie, enrollment 859\n- Row 7: Triton, enrollment 333\n\nSo Laville is in row 5 with enrollment 413. Jimtown is in row 3 with enrollment 642.\n\nNow, comparing the two: 413 (Laville) vs. 642 (Jimtown). Since 413 is less than 642, Laville does have a lower enrollment than Jimtown.\n\nNext, I should check if both schools are part of the Northern State Conference. However, the table doesn't include information about conferences; it only provides data like location, county, etc. The claim references \"northern state conference (ihsaa)\", but the table doesn't list conferences for each school. Therefore, without this info, I can't confirm their conference membership.\n\nBut wait, the user's instruction is to verify if the enrollment part of the claim is true based on the given data. Since the conference details aren't provided in the table, maybe the focus is solely on the enrollment comparison between Laville and Jimtown regardless of the conference.\n\nSo, focusing on enrollment: Laville has 413 vs. Jimtown's 642. Therefore, the claim that Laville has a lower enrollment than Jimtown is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells are row 5, column \"enrollment\" for Laville and row 3, column \"enrollment\" for Jimtown.\n</think>\n\nThe enrollment figures from the table show that Laville has fewer students than Jimtown, making the claim TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is about two schools: Laville and Triton, both presumably in the Northern State Conference under IHSAA. It's comparing their enrollments, stating that Laville has a higher enrollment than Triton.\n\nLooking at the table, which is in JSON format, it lists several schools with details like school name, location, mascot, enrollment, etc. The columns are \"school (ihsaa id)\", \"location\", \"mascot\", \"enrollment\", \"ihsaa class\", \"county\", and \"year joined\".\n\nI need to find the rows for Laville and Triton. Let's go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Bremen - mascot Lions, enrollment 505\nRow 1: Culver Community - enrollment 306\nRow 2: Glenn - enrollment 613\nRow 3: Jimtown - enrollment 642\nRow 4: Knox Community - enrollment 632\nRow 5: Laville - enrollment 413\nRow 6: New Prairie - enrollment 859\nRow 7: Triton - enrollment 333\n\nSo, Laville is in row 5 with an enrollment of 413. Triton is in row 7 with an enrollment of 333.\n\nThe claim says Laville has a higher enrollment than Triton. Comparing the numbers: 413 vs. 333. Since 413 is greater than 333, this part of the claim holds true.\n\nNow, does both schools belong to the Northern State Conference? The table doesn't explicitly mention conference affiliations, only IHSAA class and county. So, assuming that the context implies they are in the same conference based on their presence in the table, but strictly from the data given, we don't have information about conferences.\n\nHowever, since the claim mentions \"in the northern state conference (ihsaa)\", and both schools are listed under IHSAA with their respective details, it's a reasonable assumption that they are part of that conference. Therefore, based on the enrollment numbers provided in the table, Laville indeed has a higher enrollment than Triton.\n\nSo, the relevant cells for this claim would be the enrollment figures of Laville and Triton.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

There are eight rows of data for different schools.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific schools: Bremen and Culver Community.

The second row (row index 1) lists \"culver community\" with an enrollment of 306. \n\nSo, Bremen has an enrollment of 505 students, while Culver Community has 306. These numbers are clearly different. Therefore, the claim that they have the same number of enrollment is false.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant for this determination.

It states that Bremen joined the Northern State Conference five years earlier than Culver Community. So I need to check when each school joined and see if the difference in their joining years is exactly five years.\n\nLooking at the table columns: there's \"year joined\" which should indicate when each school became a member of the conference. The schools mentioned are Bremen and Culver Community, so I'll focus on their rows.\n\nFrom the data array:\n- Bremen is at row 0. Its \"year joined\" is 1989.\n- Culver Community is at row 1. Its \"year joined\" is 1977.\n\nCalculating the difference: 1989 - 1977 = 12 years. The claim says Bremen joined five years before Culver, but according to the data, it's actually the other way around\u2014Culver joined in 1977 and Bremen in 1989.

The claim says: \"in the northern state conference (ihsaa), walkerton be in a same ihsaa class than culver community\". \n\nFirst, let's break down what this means. It seems like the claim is about two schools, Walkerton and Culver Community, being in the same IHSAA class within the Northern State Conference.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a school with various details including \"ihsaa class\". The columns are: school (IHSAA id), location, mascot, enrollment, ihsaa class, county, year joined. \n\nSo, I need to find the rows for Walkerton and Culver Community and check their \"ihsaa class\" entries.\n\nLet me go through each data row:\n\n1. Bremen - Not relevant.\n2. Culver Community: Their \"ihsaa class\" is \"a\".\n3. Glenn (located in Walkerton): Wait, the location is Walkerton here? No, actually, looking back, the school name is \"glenn\", but their location is Walkerton. So maybe that's a typo or perhaps Walkerton refers to this school.\n\nWait, the claim says \"walkerton\" as a school, but in the table, I don't see a school named Walkerton. Instead, there's a school called \"Glenn\" located in Walkerton. Or maybe it's referring to the location? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- The third row is [\"glenn\", \"walkerton\", ...]. So the school name is Glenn, located in Walkerton. Their \"ihsaa class\" is \"aaa\".\n\nCulver Community is in the second row with an ihsaa class of \"a\". \n\nSo, the claim says that Walkerton (which I assume refers to the school located there, which is Glenn) and Culver Community are in the same IHSAA class. But according to the table, Glenn's class is \"aaa\" and Culver Community's is \"a\". Therefore, they are not the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the claim. It says Walkerton be in a same ihsaa class than Culver Community. If Walkerton refers to a different school, but in this table, the only entry for Walkerton as a location is Glenn, which is \"aaa\". Since Culver is \"a\", they are not the same.\n\nWait, could there be another school named Walkerton? Let me check all rows again:\n\n1. Bremen\n2. Culver Community\n3. Glenn (location Walkerton)\n4. Jimtown\n5. Knox community\n6. Laville\n7. New prairie\n8. Triton\n\nNo other schools with \"walkerton\" in their name or location except Glenn.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the ihsaa class for Culver Community and Glenn. Since they differ (\"a\" vs \"aaa\"), the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Walkerton (which refers to Glenn located in Walkerton) and Culver Community have the same IHSAA class.

But since the claim specifies IHSAA conference, I should check if both schools belong to the same conference. However, the table doesn't have a column for conference; it has \"county\" which might be related.\n\nWait, maybe the schools are in the same conference because they're listed together? Or perhaps their counties can indicate the conference. Let me see: Culver Community is in \"50 marshall\", and Laville is in \"71 st joseph\". So different counties. Does that mean they're in different conferences? But the claim says both are in the Northern State Conference, so maybe I should assume they are part of it regardless.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the conference isn't directly provided, but since the claim specifies it's about the Northern State Conference (IHSAA), and both schools are listed here, maybe that's sufficient for context.
