    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"Equestrian at the Asian Games happen every 4 years from 1982 to 2010, except for in 1990.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse what this means. Equestrian events are part of the Asian Games, and the claim is about their occurrence frequency. The claim says they occur every four years but skipped in 1990.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists data from several years: 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010. Each of these entries has a year, location, gold, silver, and bronze medalists.\n\nThe first thing I notice is the years listed. They start in 1982 and go up every four years except between 1982 and 1986, which is a four-year gap. Then from 1986 to 1994, that's an eight-year gap. Wait, but the claim says they happen every four years except in 1990.\n\nWait, let me list out the years given:\n\n- 1982\n- 1986 (4 years later)\n- 1994 (8 years after 1986)\n- 1998 (4 years after 1994)\n- 2002, 2006, 2010.\n\nSo between 1986 and 1994 is a gap of eight years. That suggests that the equestrian events didn't happen in 1990 because there's no data for 1990. So according to the table, there's no entry for 1990, which aligns with the claim that they skipped that year.\n\nBut wait, let me check all the years between 1982 and 2010:\n\n1982, next should be 1986 (4 years later). Then 1990 would be next, but there's no entry for 1990. Instead, it jumps to 1994, which is four years after 1990. So that means the event was held in 1994 instead of 1990.\n\nSo the claim says they happen every four years from 1982 to 2010 except for 1990. Looking at the table, there's no entry for 1990, which supports the claim that it was skipped. The other years are present as per the four-year interval.\n\nWait a second, let me count: from 1982 to 1986 is +4, then to 1994 is +8 (which skips 1990), then each subsequent year increases by 4. So yes, it seems that in 1990, there was no event, which matches the claim.\n\nTherefore, based on the table provided, the claim appears to be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"equestrian at the asian game have be locate in a different city every year that it occur\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that equestrian events in the Asian Games are held in a different city each year they take place. So, I need to check if each year listed has a unique location, meaning no two years have the same location for the equestrian event.\n\nLooking at the table, it has columns: year, location, gold, silver, bronze. The relevant column here is \"location\". Each row represents a different year's event details. So, I should check if all the locations are unique across each year.\n\nLet me list out the years and their corresponding locations:\n\n1. 1982 - New Delhi\n2. 1986 - Seoul\n3. 1994 - Hiroshima\n4. 1998 - Bangkok\n5. 2002 - Busan\n6. 2006 - Doha\n7. 2010 - Guangzhou\n\nNow, I'll go through each location to see if any are repeated.\n\n- New Delhi appears only once in 1982.\n- Seoul is unique to 1986.\n- Hiroshima is listed for 1994 and doesn't appear again.\n- Bangkok is only in 1998.\n- Busan is only in 2002.\n- Doha is unique to 2006.\n- Guangzhou is only in 2010.\n\nI don't see any duplicates in the locations across the years. Each location appears exactly once, corresponding to a different year. Therefore, each equestrian event in the Asian Games has been held in a different city every year as per the data provided.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is TRUE because all the locations are unique for each year listed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that each equestrian event at the Asian Games occurs in a different city each year. By examining the \"location\" column across all rows, we see that each year has a distinct city without any repetitions.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine whether the claim \"nadia al - moutawaa be the first person to win the gold medal in equestrian at the asian game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is stating. It suggests that Nadia Al-Moutawaa was the first person to win a gold medal in equestrian events during the Asian Games. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an edition of the Asian Games with details about the year, location, and medalists for what I assume are specific events. However, there's no explicit mention of the sport or event category (like equestrian) associated with each gold, silver, and bronze medals.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"equestrian,\" which is a particular sport within the Asian Games. But in the given table, we only have medalists without any indication of their sport. Therefore, I can't confirm whether Nadia Al-Moutawaa's gold medal was in equestrian or another discipline based on this data.\n\nSince the table doesn't provide information about the events or sports that each medalist participated in, it's impossible to verify if she was indeed the first in equestrian. Without knowing her event, I can't determine if her win was the first gold in that specific sport.\n\nTherefore, the claim cannot be fully supported by the provided data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the gold medalist for equestrian at the asian game have be different in every year they have occur.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It's stating that each year the Asian Games took place, the person who won the gold medal in equestrian was a different individual. So, I need to check if all the gold medalists across the years listed are unique.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year of the Asian Games with details about the location and medalists for equestrian events. The columns are \"year,\" \"location,\" \"gold,\" \"silver,\" and \"bronze.\" \n\nI'll go through each row and list out the gold medalists:\n\n1. 1982: Nadia al - moutawaa\n2. 1986: Takashi Tomura\n3. 1994: Konoshin Kuwahara\n4. 1998: Jin Kanno\n5. 2002: Mikaela Mar\u00e3da Jaworski\n6. 2006: Ali Yousuf al - rumaihi\n7. 2010: Ramzy al duhami\n\nNow, I'll check if any of these names repeat. Scanning through the list:\n\n- Nadia al-moutawaa appears only once in 1982.\n- Takashi Tomura is unique to 1986.\n- Konoshin Kuwahara is listed for 1994 and then again in 1998 as a silver medalist, but the gold in 1998 is Jin Kanno. So no repetition in golds here.\n- Jin Kanno is unique to 1998.\n- Mikaela Mar\u00e3da Jaworski appears only in 2002.\n- Ali Yousuf al-rumaihi is unique to 2006.\n- Ramzy al duhami is unique to 2010.\n\nNone of the gold medalists repeat across different years. Each year has a distinct individual winning gold in equestrian events as per this table. Therefore, the claim that each occurrence had a different gold medalist is true based on the given data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that every year the Asian Games occurred, there was a different gold medalist in equestrian events.

Let's read through the problem step by step.\n\nThe table has columns: year, location, gold, silver, bronze. Each row represents a specific Asian Games event with details about the host city and medalists.\n\nThe claim states: \"South Korea be the only country to have hosted equestrian at the Asian Game more than 1 time, in Seoul and Doha (and incheon, but that be only find elsewhere on the source page).\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse this claim. It says South Korea is the only country that has hosted equestrian events more than once. Specifically, it mentions Seoul and Doha as host cities where they've done so. Also, there's a mention of Incheon, but it's noted that information isn't found in this table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row shows the year and location (host city) for each event. So, I need to check how many times South Korea has hosted equestrian events here.\n\nLet me look through each data row:\n\n1. 1982: New Delhi\n2. 1986: Seoul\n3. 1994: Hiroshima\n4. 1998: Bangkok\n5. 2002: Busan\n6. 2006: Doha\n7. 2010: Guangzhou\n\nNow, identifying which locations are in South Korea:\n\n- Seoul is the capital of South Korea.\n- Busan is a city in South Korea.\n\nSo, in the table, South Korea hosted equestrian events in 1986 (Seoul) and 2002 (Busan). That's two times. The claim mentions Seoul and Doha as hosts by South Korea. Wait, but Doha is actually the capital of Qatar. So that might be a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check again: The table shows Doha in 2006. But according to my knowledge, Doha is indeed in Qatar, not South Korea. So the claim incorrectly attributes Doha as a host by South Korea when it's actually Qatar.\n\nSo, the relevant rows are:\n\n- Row 1 (index 1): Seoul, which is correct.\n- Row 5 (index 5): Busan, which is also in South Korea, but the claim doesn't mention Busan; instead, it incorrectly includes Doha as a South Korean host.\n\nSince the claim says that only South Korea has hosted more than once, and it lists Seoul and Doha, but Doha isn't South Korea. Therefore, the table shows that South Korea hosted twice (Seoul and Busan), but the claim is incorrect about Doha being a South Korean host. Thus, the claim is not fully supported by the data.\n\nWait, no, because in the table, Doha is in Qatar (assuming from location names). So the claim incorrectly includes Doha as a South Korean host, which isn't accurate according to the table. Therefore, the part of the claim about Doha being hosted by South Korea is false. Hence, the entire statement that South Korea is the only country to have hosted more than once with Seoul and Doha is incorrect because Doha wasn't hosted by South Korea.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that South Korea hosted in Doha (which is Qatar), so it's not true.

It states that equestrian events in the Asian Games occur every four years starting from 1982 up until 2010. To verify this, I should check the years listed in the table to see if they follow a consistent four-year interval between each event.\n\nLooking at the \"year\" column in the data:\n- The first entry is 1982.\n- Next is 1986, which is indeed four years later.\n- Then comes 1994.

The claim says: \"Equestrian at the Asian Games have been located in a different city every year it occurs except 1994 and 1998.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is stating. It's saying that each year equestrian events took place, they were held in a different city except for two years: 1994 and 1998. So, those two years are exceptions where maybe the location didn't change or something else happened.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists several rows with data about each year's event, including the location where the equestrian events took place. The columns are \"year,\" \"location,\" \"gold,\" \"silver,\" and \"bronze.\" So for each row, I can check the \"year\" and \"location.\"\n\nThe claim mentions exceptions in 1994 and 1998, so I should check those two years first.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- For 1994: The location is Hiroshima.\n- For 1998: The location is Bangkok.\n\nNow, to verify if these are the only exceptions where the locations didn't change from the previous or next year. Let's go through each year and compare the locations with their adjacent years.\n\nStarting from 1982:\n- 1982: New Delhi\n- Next is 1986: Seoul \u2192 different city.\n- Then 1994: Hiroshima \u2192 different from Seoul.\n- 1998: Bangkok \u2192 different from Hiroshima.\n- 2002: Busan \u2192 different from Bangkok.\n- 2006: Doha \u2192 different from Busan.\n- 2010: Guangzhou \u2192 different from Doha.\n\nWait, so each year's location is different from the previous one. So, there are no two consecutive years with the same location except maybe between non-consecutive years? Let me check all possible pairs:\n\nCheck if any two different years have the same location:\n- 1982: New Delhi\n- 1986: Seoul \u2192 unique.\n- 1994: Hiroshima \u2192 unique.\n- 1998: Bangkok \u2192 unique.\n- 2002: Busan \u2192 unique.\n- 2006: Doha \u2192 unique.\n- 2010: Guangzhou \u2192 unique.\n\nSo, all the locations are different for each year. That means that every occurrence of equestrian events was in a different city each time, except perhaps if there were multiple entries for the same year with the same location. But looking at the table, each year appears only once, and all locations are unique across years.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"except 1994 and 1998.\" That would imply that in those two years, the location didn't change from some other occurrence? Or maybe it's a typo. Let me re-examine the claim: \"have be locate in a different city every year that it occur except 1994 and 1998.\"\n\nHmm, perhaps the intended meaning is that in all years except 1994 and 1998, equestrian events were held in a new city each time. But according to the table, they are always in different cities every year.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's think again: The claim says that every year it occurs, it's in a different city except for 1994 and 1998. So perhaps, in those two years, either there were multiple events or the location remained the same as some other year.\n\nBut looking at the table, each year has a unique location. So, if all locations are unique per year, then the claim that they have been located in different cities every year except 1994 and 1998 is incorrect because those two years don't repeat any location either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Maybe the claim refers to consecutive years where the location didn't change? For example, if equestrian events were held in the same city for two consecutive years except in 1994 and 1998.\n\nLooking at the data:\n- From 1982 (New Delhi) to 1986 (Seoul): different.\n- 1986 to 1994: different cities. So a gap of 8 years, but locations are still different.\n- 1994 to 1998: Hiroshima to Bangkok \u2192 different.\n- 1998 to 2002: different.\n- 2002 to 2006: different.\n- 2006 to 2010: different.\n\nSo, there's no instance where two consecutive years have the same location. Therefore, all events were in different cities each year they occurred. Thus, the claim that except for 1994 and 1998, they are in different cities every year is FALSE because even those exceptions don't hold\u2014those years also had unique locations.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The claim says \"every year that it occur[s] except 1994 and 1998.\" So perhaps the events were held in the same city for 1994 and 1998 as some other years. But looking at the data, each location is unique per year. Therefore, there are no two years with the same location except if a year is repeated. Since all years are unique and locations are unique, the claim that they were in different cities every year except 1994 and 1998 doesn't hold because even those two years don't have repeating locations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to something else, like equestrian events being held in a city multiple times but only in 1994 and 1998 they were exceptions. But given the data, that's not the case.\n\nTherefore, since all entries show different cities each year without any repeats except perhaps none, the claim is FALSE because there are no exceptions where locations repeat.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that equestrian events at the Asian Games took place in a different city every year except for 1994 and 1998. However, upon reviewing the data, each year's location is unique with no repeats, including 1994 and 1998. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"exception_years\": [\"1994\", \"1998\"],\n  \"all_events_in_different_cities\": true,\n  \"claim_validity\": false\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the gold medalist for equestrian at the asian game have been different in every year they have occur except 1994 and 1998.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table represents. It looks like each row corresponds to a year of the Asian Games, with columns for the year, location, gold, silver, and bronze medalists.\n\nThe claim is about equestrian events, but looking at the table's columns\u2014year, location, gold, silver, bronze\u2014it doesn't specify the sport. So I'm assuming that this table specifically refers to equestrian events because the claim mentions it. Otherwise, without knowing the sport, we can't be sure.\n\nNext, I'll check each year's gold medalist to see if there are any repeats except for 1994 and 1998 as mentioned in the claim.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- 1982: Nadia Al-Moutawaa\n- 1986: Takashi Tomura\n- 1994: Konoshin Kuwahara\n- 1998: Jin Kanno\n- 2002: Mikaela Mar\u00e3da Jaworski\n- 2006: Ali Yousuf Al-Rumaihi\n- 2010: Ramzy Al Duhami\n\nNow, I'll check for any duplicates. Scanning through the gold medalists:\n\n- Each year from 1982 to 2010 has a different person winning gold.\n- There's no repetition in the names across the years.\n\nWait, but the claim says except 1994 and 1998. So according to the claim, those two years should have the same gold medalist. However, looking at the data:\n\n- 1994: Konoshin Kuwahara\n- 1998: Jin Kanno\n\nThese are different names. That means in both 1994 and 1998, the gold medalists were different from each other as well.\n\nTherefore, according to the table, every year has a unique gold medalist, including 1994 and 1998. The claim suggests that except for those two years, all others have different winners, but in reality, even those two years don't repeat any winners.\n\nSo, the claim is incorrect because it states that 1994 and 1998 had the same gold medalist when they actually didn't. Thus, the correct answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"south korea be the only country to have host equestrian at the asian game more than 1 time, in seoul 2 time.\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the table represents. Looking at the columns: year, location, gold, silver, bronze. So each row seems to represent an Asian Games event, specifically equestrian events, since it lists medalists in those categories. The 'location' column would be where the games were hosted that year.\n\nThe claim is about South Korea hosting equestrian events more than once and that Seoul was the host twice. Let me check the locations in each row to see which countries are listed as hosts.\n\nLooking at the data:\n- 1982: New Delhi\n- 1986: Seoul\n- 1994: Hiroshima\n- 1998: Bangkok\n- 2002: Busan\n- 2006: Doha\n- 2010: Guangzhou\n\nWait, the locations are cities, but they correspond to countries. So New Delhi is in India, Seoul in South Korea, Hiroshima in Japan, Bangkok in Thailand, Busan in South Korea again, Doha in Qatar, and Guangzhou in China.\n\nSo looking at South Korea's hosting: Seoul (1986) and Busan (2002). That means South Korea hosted the Asian Games twice. Now, checking if any other country has hosted more than once.\n\nLooking through the list:\n- India: 1982\n- Japan: 1994\n- Thailand: 1998\n- South Korea: 1986 and 2002 (so two times)\n- Qatar: 2006\n- China: 2010\n\nSo only South Korea hosted twice. So the claim that they are the only country to have hosted more than once is true.\n\nNow, the second part of the claim says \"in Seoul 2 time.\" Wait, but in our data, Seoul was a host in 1986 and Busan in 2002. So Seoul hosted only once. The claim says it's two times in Seoul, which isn't accurate according to the table.\n\nSo putting this together: South Korea did host twice (Seoul once and Busan once), but they didn't host both times in Seoul. Therefore, the claim that South Korea is the only country to have hosted more than once is correct, but the part about hosting it twice in Seoul is incorrect because it was only once.\n\nTherefore, the entire claim isn't fully supported by the table. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that South Korea is the only country to host equestrian events at the Asian Games more than once and specifically mentions hosting twice in Seoul. However, according to the table, South Korea hosted the games in Seoul in 1986 and Busan in 2002, totaling two times but not both in Seoul.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
