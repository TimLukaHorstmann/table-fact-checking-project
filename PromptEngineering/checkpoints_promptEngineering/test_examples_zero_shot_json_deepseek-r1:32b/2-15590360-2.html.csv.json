The columns are: class, season, race, podiums, and pole. The rows correspond to different classes with their respective data.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions the \"moto2\" class. So I need to find the row where the class is moto2. Looking through the data array:\n\nRow 0: 125 cc\nRow 1: 250 cc\nRow 2: motogp\nRow 3: moto2\nRow 4: total\n\nSo, the relevant row is index 3.\n\nNow, I check the 'pole' column in that row. The columns are ordered as class, season, race, podiums, pole. So the 'pole' value is the fifth element in the row array. Looking at row 3: [moto2, \"2010 -\", 62, 4, 0]\n\nThe pole value here is 0. The claim states that there are 0 poles in the moto2 class, which matches exactly with this value.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 3,\n       \"column_name\": \"pole\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

The rows include different classes like 125 cc, 250 cc, motogp, moto2, and total.\n\nThe claim mentions \"4 pole have a moto2 class.\" So I'm interpreting this as checking if there are 4 poles in the moto2 class. \n\nLooking at the 'moto2' row (row index 3), under the 'pole' column, the value is 0. That means there were zero pole positions achieved in the moto2 class according to the table.\n\nSo the claim states there are 4 poles, but the table shows 0. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data provided. \n\nThe relevant cell for this check is row index 3 and column name 'pole'.
