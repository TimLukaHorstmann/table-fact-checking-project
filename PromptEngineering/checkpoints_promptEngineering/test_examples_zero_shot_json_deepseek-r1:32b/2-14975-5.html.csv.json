    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"90 game be play for the series for the sawhorse dollar trophy\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It seems a bit awkwardly phrased, but it looks like it's trying to say that there were 90 games played in the series associated with the sawhorse dollar trophy.\n\nLooking at the table provided in JSON format, I'll examine each column and row to find relevant information. The columns are: teams, name, trophy, first met, games played, series record.\n\nThe claim mentions two key pieces of information: \"90 games\" and \"sawhorse dollar trophy.\" So I need to check which rows have the \"sawhorse dollar\" as their trophy and see if the corresponding \"games played\" is 90.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Trophy is \"empire cup\". Doesn't match, so move on.\n2. Row 1: Trophy is \"trustee 's cup\". Not matching either.\n3. Row 2: Trophy is \"sawhorse dollar\". This matches the claim. Now check how many games were played here. The value under \"games played\" for this row is \"90 games\".\n4. Rows 3 and 4 have trophies as \"none\", so they don't match.\n\nSo, the relevant row is row index 2. In that row, both the trophy and the number of games played are as per the claim. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there were 90 games for the sawhorse dollar trophy series, which matches the data in the third row (index 2) where the trophy is \"sawhorse dollar\" and games played are \"90 games\". \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n1. Identify the key elements in the claim: \"90 game\", \"sawhorse dollar trophy\".\n2. Locate rows with \"sawhorse dollar\" under the \"trophy\" column.\n3. In row index 2, the \"games played\" is indeed \"90 games\".\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"trophy\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"games played\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"more than 100 games be play for the series with the sawhorse dollar trophy.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that there have been more than 100 games played in the series that has the Sawhorse Dollar Trophy.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different rivalry or series between two teams. The columns are \"teams\", \"name\", \"trophy\", \"first met\", \"games played\", and \"series record\".\n\nI need to find which row corresponds to the Sawhorse Dollar Trophy because that's what the claim is about. So I'll look through each row's \"trophy\" column.\n\nStarting with the first row: the trophy is Empire Cup, so not that one.\nSecond row: Trustee's Cup, not relevant here.\nThird row: The trophy is Sawhorse Dollar. That's the one we need to check.\nFourth row: No trophy mentioned.\nFifth row: Also no trophy mentioned.\n\nSo, the third row has the \"sawhorse dollar\" as the trophy. Now, I need to look at how many games were played in this series. The column for that is \"games played\".\n\nIn the third row under \"games played\", it says 90 games. So according to the table, there have been 90 games played in the series with the Sawhorse Dollar Trophy.\n\nThe claim states that more than 100 games were played, but the table shows only 90 games. Therefore, the claim is false because 90 is less than 100.\n\nI should make sure I didn't miss anything else. Let me double-check: The third row has \"dartmouth - princeton\" as teams, name is none, trophy is Sawhorse Dollar, first met in 1897, games played 90, series record is 43-43-4.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the relevant cells are the \"trophy\" and \"games played\" from the third row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"trophy\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"games played\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
