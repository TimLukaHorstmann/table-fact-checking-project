This matches part of the claim.\n- Row 1: Outcome is \"winner\", Year is 2003, Championship is Toronto.

The claim says that Martina Navratilova was the partner for both the 2003 Rome championship and the 2003 Toronto championship.\n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. It has columns: outcome, year, championship, surface, partner, opponents, score. The data is in rows with each row representing a different event or match.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific championships in 2003: Rome and Toronto. I need to check both of these entries in the table to see if Martina Navratilova was listed as the partner for both.\n\nLooking at the first data row, it's about the championship in Rome, year 2003. The outcome is \"winner\". Under the 'partner' column, it says \"martina navratilova\". So that matches part of the claim.\n\nNext, I check the second data row, which is about Toronto in 2003. Again, the outcome is \"winner\". The partner listed here is also \"martina navratilova\". \n\nSo both rows have Martina Navratilova as the partner for these two championships. That means the claim is accurate based on the information provided.\n\nI should note down which cells I checked to support my answer. For Rome 2003, that's row index 0, column 'partner'.

The claim says: \"the player be the runner-up at the 2004 Indian Wells championship and also the runner-up at the 2004 Miami championship.\" \n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. It has columns: outcome, year, championship, surface, partner, opponents, score. There are five rows of data.\n\nI need to check for two specific events in 2004: Indian Wells and Miami, both where the player was a runner-up.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. First row (index 0): Outcome is winner, year 2003. Not relevant.\n2. Second row (index 1): Winner again, 2003. Not relevant.\n3. Third row (index 2): Runner-up, year 2004, championship Indian Wells. This matches the first part of the claim.\n   - So, this is a relevant cell: outcome and championship here.\n\n4. Fourth row (index 3): Runner-up, year 2004, championship Miami. This matches the second part of the claim.\n   - Relevant cells here as well: outcome and championship.\n\n5. Fifth row (index 4): Winner in 2005, so not relevant.\n\nSo both conditions are met. The player was a runner-up in both tournaments in 2004. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, compiling the relevant cells:\n\n- For Indian Wells: row index 2, columns \"outcome\" and \"championship\".\n- For Miami: row index 3, same columns.\n\nWait, but each entry has multiple columns. The user instructions mention that for each condition in the claim, we need to check which cells are relevant. So for each part of the claim (Indian Wells and Miami), I should include the rows where those championships occurred and their outcomes were runner-up.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Row 2: \"outcome\" is runner-up and \"championship\" is Indian Wells.\n- Row 3: \"outcome\" is runner-up and \"championship\" is Miami.\n\nBut in the example given earlier, each condition was mapped to a row index and column. So perhaps I should list all the cells that were checked for each part of the claim.\n\nSo, for Indian Wells 2004:\n\n- row_index: 2\n   - Check \"outcome\": runner-up.\n   - Check \"championship\": Indian Wells.\n   - Also check \"year\": 2004.\n\nSimilarly, for Miami 2004:\n\n- row_index:3\n   - outcome: runner-up.\n   - championship: Miami.\n   - year:2004.\n\nBut the user instructions say to determine which cells are relevant. So perhaps each of these checks corresponds to a cell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just include all the cells that were used in verifying the claim, regardless of whether they are checked for being correct or not.\n\nIn this case:\n\nFor Indian Wells 2004 runner-up: we check row index 2's outcome and championship.\n\nSimilarly, for Miami 2004 runner-up: row index3's outcome and championship.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- {row_2, \"outcome\"}\n- {row_2, \"championship\"}\n- {row_3, \"outcome\"}\n- {row_3, \"championship\"}\n\nWait, but in the example given earlier, each condition (like revenue and employees) was mapped to a specific row. So perhaps I should list all four cells that were checked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each part of the claim, we need to list the rows where the conditions are met.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- The first part: runner-up at 2004 Indian Wells is in row 2.\n   - Relevant columns here would be \"outcome\" and \"championship\".\n- The second part: runner-up at 2004 Miami is in row3.\n   - Same relevant columns.\n\nBut perhaps, for each of these, I need to list all the cells that were checked. So each part has two cells (outcome and championship) from their respective rows.\n\nSo compiling this, the relevant_cells would be:\n\n- {\"row_2\", \"outcome\"}\n- {\"row_2\", \"championship\"}\n- {\"row_3\", \"outcome\"}\n- {\"row_3\", \"championship\"}\n\nBut in the example, each condition was a single cell per row. Maybe I should structure it that way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each relevant row (rows 2 and3), include all columns necessary to verify their status as runner-up.\n\nSo:\n\nFor row2:\n   - outcome: runner-up\n   - championship: Indian Wells\n   - year: 2004\n\nSimilarly for row3:\n   - outcome: runner-up\n   - championship: Miami\n   - year: 2004\n\nBut perhaps the claim doesn't specify checking the year again, but in reality, we do check it to confirm it's 2004. So maybe include the \"year\" column as well.\n\nBut looking back at the user's example response, they only included two cells for each condition (Revenue and Employees). However, in our case, we have multiple conditions: two tournaments in 2004 where the player was a runner-up. So perhaps the relevant_cells should include all four: two outcomes and two championships.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just the row indices are sufficient because each row corresponds to one part of the claim.\n\nBut I think it's better to list each specific cell that was checked for each condition in the claim. So:\n\n- For being runner-up at Indian Wells 2004:\n   - row 2, outcome\n   - row2, championship\n\n- For being runner-up at Miami 2004:\n   - row3, outcome\n   - row3, championship\n\nSo that's four cells in total.\n\nWait, but in the example, each condition corresponded to a single cell. So maybe I should list two cells per claim part: one for the year, one for the championship, and one for the outcome? No, perhaps only the ones that were directly related.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the user's instruction says \"which cells are relevant\", I think it refers to all the cells that were involved in checking whether each condition of the claim is met.\n\nTherefore, for each tournament (Indian Wells and Miami), we have:\n\n- outcome: to check if it was a runner-up.\n- championship: to confirm the tournament.\n- year: to ensure it's 2004.\n\nBut perhaps, since the user didn't specify in the example including the \"year\" column, maybe they just want the key columns that were checked. So focusing on outcome and championship as those directly address being a runner-up at the specified tournaments.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- For Indian Wells:\n   - row 2: \"outcome\"\n   - row 2: \"championship\"\n\n- For Miami:\n   - row3: \"outcome\"\n   - row3: \"championship\"\n\nHence, four cells in total.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to list all the necessary cells for each tournament. So yes, including both outcome and championship from each relevant row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is that the player was a runner-up at both the 2004 Indian Wells and Miami tournaments. \n\nTo verify this, we check:\n\n1. For Indian Wells 2004:\n   - **Row Index 2**\n     - Outcome: Runner-up\n     - Championship: Indian Wells\n\n2. For Miami 2004:\n   - **Row Index 3**\n     - Outcome: Runner-up\n     - Championship: Miami\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, confirming the claim.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- Row 2: \"outcome\", \"championship\"\n- Row 3: \"outcome\", \"championship\"\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"claim\": \"The player was a runner-up at both the 2004 Indian Wells and Miami tournaments.\",\n    \"is_claim_supported_by_evidence\": true,\n    \"evidence\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 2,\n            \"columns\": [\"outcome\", \"championship\"]\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 3,\n            \"columns\": [\"outcome\", \"championship\"]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"in 2003, the player be the winner at the 2004 championship in miami and also the championship in indian well.\" Hmm, that seems a bit confusing because it mentions 2003 but talks about championships in 2004.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It says two things:\n1. In 2003, the player was the winner at the 2004 Miami championship.\n2. The same player also won the championship in Indian Wells in 2003 (since it's implied by \"in 2003\").\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because 2004 is a different year than 2003. So maybe there's a typo or confusion here. Alternatively, perhaps the claim means that in 2003, the player won both the Miami and Indian Wells championships in 2004? That still seems odd.\n\nLooking at the table, let me check each relevant cell for the years mentioned and the outcomes.\n\nFor Miami in 2004:\n- The row with \"championship\" as \"miami\" and \"year\" 2004 has an outcome of \"runner-up\". So the player was a runner-up there, not a winner.\n\nFor Indian Wells in 2004:\n- Similarly, the row for \"indian wells\" in 2004 shows the outcome as \"runner-up\".\n\nNow, checking if Miami and Indian Wells had events in 2003. Looking at the data:\n\nIn 2003, there are two entries: Rome (clay) and Toronto (hard). Both have outcomes of \"winner\". So the player won both those tournaments in 2003.\n\nBut the claim mentions Miami and Indian Wells in 2004. Since in 2004, the player was a runner-up in both Miami and Indian Wells, not a winner, the claim is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because it incorrectly states that the player won those championships in 2004 when they were actually runners-up.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE.

There are five data rows in total.\n\nThe claim is: \"the partner for both the championship in rome in 2003 and the championship in toronto in 2003 be alicia molik\"\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Alicia Molik's name appears in one of the later entries, not in 2003.

There are five rows of data.\n\nLooking for entries where the year is 2004 because that's when both events supposedly happened according to the claim.

So this doesn't match since it's a win in 2003, not 2004.\n\nRow 1: Outcome is winner, year 2003, championship Toronto, surface hard. Again, a win but in 2003, so irrelevant.\n\nRow 2: Outcome is runner-up, year 2004, championship Indian Wells. So this is a runner-up position in 2004, but the championship is Indian Wells, not Rome or Toronto as per the claim.\n\nRow 3: Outcome is runner-up, year 2004, championship Miami.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the opponent in 2005 be jelena doki\u0107 and nadia petrova and in rome in 2003, the opponent be lisa raymond rennae stubbs.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. In 2005, the opponents were Jelena Doki\u0107 and Nadia Petrova.\n2. In Rome in 2003, the opponents were Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs.\n\nI'll check each part against the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five rows of data. Each row has information about an outcome, year, championship location, surface type, partner, opponents, and score.\n\nStarting with the first part: opponent in 2005 being Jelena Doki\u0107 and Nadia Petrova. I'll scan through each row to find any entries from 2005. The fifth row is the only one with the year 2005. Let me look at that row.\n\nIn row index 4 (since indexing starts at 0), the data is:\n- Outcome: winner\n- Year: 2005\n- Championship: miami\n- Surface: hard\n- Partner: Alicia Molik\n- Opponents: \"lisa raymond rennae stubbs\"\n- Score: \"7 - 5, 6 - 7 (5 - 7), 6 - 2\"\n\nSo the opponents in 2005 were Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs, not Jelena Doki\u0107 and Nadia Petrova. This means the first part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nNow checking the second part: opponent in Rome in 2003 being Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs. Looking at the rows with the year 2003, there are two entries (row indices 0 and 1).\n\nRow index 0:\n- Outcome: winner\n- Year: 2003\n- Championship: rome\n- Surface: clay\n- Partner: Martina Navratilova\n- Opponents: \"jelena doki\u0107 nadia petrova\"\n- Score: \"6 - 4, 5 - 7, 6 - 2\"\n\nSo in Rome 2003, the opponents were Jelena Doki\u0107 and Nadia Petrova. The claim says they should be Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs, which is incorrect.\n\nPutting it together, both parts of the claim are false. Therefore, the overall answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the partner in 2004 at the indian well championship be martina navratilova, but in 2003 at the toronto championship, the partner be lisa raymond.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the claim into two parts and check each against the data.\n\nStarting with the first part: In 2004 at the Indian Wells championship, was the partner Martina Navratilova?\n\nLooking at the table, let's find the row where the year is 2004 and the championship is Indian Wells. Scanning through the rows:\n\nRow 2 has outcome \"runner-up\", year 2004, championship \"indian wells\". The partner here is listed as \"elena likhovtseva\". So in 2004 at Indian Wells, the partner was Elena Likhovtseva, not Martina Navratilova. That means this part of the claim is false.\n\nNow, checking the second part: In 2003 at the Toronto championship, was the partner Lisa Raymond?\n\nLooking for the row with year 2003 and championship \"toronto\". Row 1 has these details. The partner there is listed as \"martina navratilova\", not Lisa Raymond. So this part of the claim is also false.\n\nWait, that's interesting because both parts are incorrect. But let me double-check in case I missed something.\n\nFor 2004 Indian Wells: Only row 2 matches. Partner is Elena Likhovtseva.\n\nFor 2003 Toronto: Row 1 shows partner as Martina Navratilova, not Lisa Raymond. So the claim incorrectly states both partners.\n\nTherefore, since both parts of the claim are incorrect, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells would be the ones where we checked the partner column for those specific years and championships.\n\nSo relevant_cells would include:\n- For 2004 Indian Wells: row index 2, column \"partner\".\n- For 2003 Toronto: row index 1, column \"partner\".\n\nThat's how I arrived at the conclusion.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
