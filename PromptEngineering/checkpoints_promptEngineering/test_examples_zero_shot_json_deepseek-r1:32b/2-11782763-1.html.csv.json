    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"William Adelin be the only one who became heir due to birth\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. The key points here are that William Adelin became an heir and that his reason for becoming heir was due to birth. Additionally, the claim specifies that he is the only one who did so.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I need to find which rows mention William Adelin and check the relevant columns. The columns we're interested in are \"heir,\" \"reason,\" and maybe others to confirm uniqueness.\n\nFrom the data provided:\n\n- Row 5: [\"william adelin\", \"heir apparent\", \"only son\", \"1103\", \"born\", \"25 november 1120\", \"henry i\"]\n  \nIn this row, William Adelin is listed as the heir, and the reason he became heir is \"born.\" That directly supports the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, I need to check if there are any other heirs who became heirs due to birth. Let's scan through all rows:\n\nRow 0: Robert Curthose - reason was \"father became king.\"\nRow 1: Succession unclear, not applicable.\nRow 2: Robert Curthose again - reason was \"by agreement.\"\nRow 3: Henry Beauclerc - reason was \"Robert's rebellion.\"\nRow 4: Succession unclear again.\nRow 5: William Adelin - as above, born.\nRow 6: Empress Matilda - her brother died.\n\nSo, looking through all the reasons for becoming heir, only William Adelin's reason is listed as \"born.\" The others have different reasons. This means he is indeed the only one who became heir due to birth.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that William Adelin was the only one who became an heir due to birth. Checking the table:\n\n- **William Adelin** in row 5 has \"born\" as the reason for becoming heir.\n- No other rows list \"birth\" or \"born\" as the reason.\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"heir\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"reason\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"only 2 heir have son as their relationship to monarch\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table in JSON format. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: \"heir\", \"status\", \"relationship to monarch\", \"became heir\", \"reason\", \"ceased to be heir\", and \"monarch\". So each row represents an entry about a specific heir and their relationship to the monarch during certain periods.\n\nThe claim is that only two heirs have \"son\" as their relationship to the monarch. To verify this, I need to check each row in the table where the \"relationship to monarch\" column says \"son\".\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n1. The first row has Robert Curthose with \"son\" as his relationship.\n2. The second row is about an unclear succession from 1077-1087, so it's not relevant here.\n3. The third row again mentions Robert Curthose but now his relationship is listed as \"elder brother\".\n4. Henry Beauclerc in the fourth row has a relationship of \"younger brother\", so that doesn't fit either.\n5. The fifth row is another unclear succession period, so we can skip it.\n6. William Adelin in the sixth row is the \"only son\" of Henry I.\n7. The last row talks about Empress Matilda as the \"only child\", which includes daughter but not son.\n\nSo from this, Robert Curthose and William Adelin are both listed as sons of their respective monarchs. That makes two heirs with the relationship of \"son\".\n\nWait a minute\u2014the first entry for Robert is as \"son\", then later he's referred to as an elder brother under William II. However, each row represents different periods. So Robert Curthose was initially the son (under William I) and later became the elder brother (under William II). Therefore, in both instances, his relationship as a son is only once when he was the heir presumptive under William I.\n\nSo the two relevant rows are:\n- Row 0: Robert Curthose with \"son\" relationship.\n- Row 5: William Adelin with \"only son\" relationship.\n\nThat makes exactly two heirs where their relationship to the monarch is as a son. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nI should make sure there's no other entry with \"son\" in the \"relationship to monarch\". Scanning through all rows again, I don't see any others. So yes, only these two meet the condition.\n</think>\n\nThe table lists Robert Curthose and William Adelin as heirs with the relationship of son to their respective monarchs.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"relationship to monarch\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"relationship to monarch\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"henry beauclerc became heir in 1088, a year after robert curthose\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim. The claim has two main points: Henry Beauclerc becoming heir in 1088 and that this happened a year after Robert Curthose did so.\n\nLooking at the table, let's identify the relevant rows for both Henry Beauclerc and Robert Curthose. \n\nStarting with Henry Beauclerc:\n- I find his entry in row index 3. The columns are \"heir\", \"status\", \"relationship to monarch\", etc.\n- In the \"became heir\" column (which is column index 3), it says 1088.\n\nNow, for Robert Curthose:\n- He appears twice in the table. First in row 0 and again in row 2.\n- Row 0 shows he became heir in 1066, but that's under William I.\n- The second entry is more relevant since it's about him becoming heir after a rebellion. In row 2, the \"became heir\" column says 1087.\n\nSo Henry became heir in 1088 and Robert in 1087. That means Henry did become heir a year after Robert. \n\nI also need to ensure there are no other entries that might contradict this. Checking all rows, the succession seems clear for both of them without any conflicting information.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Henry Beauclerc became heir in 1088, which was a year after Robert Curthose. Checking the table:\n\n- Henry Beauclerc's \"became heir\" is listed as 1088 (row 3).\n- Robert Curthose's \"became heir\" is listed as 1087 (row 2).\n\nThus, Henry became heir exactly one year after Robert.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"henry beauclerc cease to be heir on 2 august 1100, follow by william adelin 20 year later.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. Henry Beauclerc ceased to be heir on August 2, 1100.\n2. Then, William Adelin became the heir 20 years later.\n\nI need to check each part against the table data.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several rows. Let me go through them one by one to find relevant information about Henry Beauclerc and William Adelin.\n\nStarting with Henry Beauclerc: The table has a row where the \"heir\" is Henry Beauclerc. This is row index 3. In that row, under \"ceased to be heir,\" it says \"2 august 1100.\" So the first part of the claim checks out here. That means Henry did stop being the heir on that date.\n\nNow for William Adelin: Let's see when he became the heir. Looking through the rows, I find William Adelin in row index 5 under the \"heir\" column. The \"became heir\" column says \"1103.\" So according to the table, William became the heir in 1103.\n\nThe claim says that this happened 20 years after August 2, 1100. Let's do a quick calculation: 1100 + 20 = 1120. But the table shows William Adelin becoming heir in 1103, which is only 3 years after Henry ceased to be heir. That doesn't match the claim of 20 years later.\n\nSo the second part of the claim is incorrect. Therefore, the entire claim isn't fully supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Henry Beauclerc stopped being heir on August 2, 1100, which is correct as per the table (row 3). However, William Adelin became heir in 1103, not 20 years later. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"ceased to be heir\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"robert curthose be the heir 2 time, in 1066 and 1087\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the table structure. The columns are: heir, status, relationship to monarch, became heir, reason, ceased to be heir, monarch. There are seven rows of data.\n\nThe claim mentions Robert Curthose being an heir twice in 1066 and 1087. So I need to check if there are two entries where he is listed as the heir in those years.\n\nStarting with 1066: I'll scan through each row's \"became heir\" column. The first row (index 0) shows Robert Curthose as the heir, who became heir in 1066 when his father became king. So that's one instance.\n\nNext, for 1087: Looking further down, the third row (index 2) has Robert again as the heir presumptive, becoming heir in 1087 by agreement under William II. That's the second time he was an heir. \n\nWait a minute, but I should check if there are any other mentions of him being heir beyond these two instances. The fourth row is about Henry Beauclerc and doesn't mention Robert, so no. There's also a row where the succession is unclear between 1077-1087 under William I, but that's not Robert specifically; it's more of a placeholder indicating uncertainty.\n\nSo from the table, there are exactly two entries where Robert Curthose was the heir: once in 1066 and again in 1087. That matches the claim perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, supported by the relevant cells showing his two instances as heir.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because Robert Curthose appears twice in the table as the heir in the specified years.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"heir\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"heir\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"henry beauclerc be the only 1 who became heir due to birth\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It states that Henry Beauclerc was the only person who became an heir solely because of his birth. So I need to check if there are any other entries in the table where someone became an heir due to their birth and whether Henry is indeed the only one.\n\nLooking at the table columns: \"heir\", \"status\", \"relationship to monarch\", \"became heir\", \"reason\", \"ceased to be heir\", \"monarch\". The relevant column for this claim seems to be the \"reason\" column because it will indicate why each person became an heir.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row in the data array and examine the \"reason\" field:\n\n1. Row 0: Robert Curthose became heir because his father became king. So the reason is \"father became king.\" This isn't due to birth; it's due to a change in status (father becoming king). So not relevant.\n\n2. Row 1: Succession unclear from 1077-1087, so no specific person or reason here.\n\n3. Row 2: Robert Curthose again became heir by agreement, not because of birth.\n\n4. Row 3: Henry Beauclerc became heir due to Robert's rebellion. The reason is \"robert 's rebellion,\" which implies it was due to political reasons rather than his own birth.\n\nWait a second, but the claim says he became heir \"due to birth.\" Hmm, perhaps I need to look more carefully. Let me re-examine row 3: the \"reason\" is \"robert 's rebellion.\" So Henry became heir because Robert rebelled, not necessarily due to his own birth. However, in row 4, it's unclear, and row 5 shows William Adelin as heir apparent because he was born as the only son, with the reason being \"born.\"\n\nWait, so in row 5: William Adelin is listed as an heir apparent, and the reason is \"born.\" That means his status came from his birth. So according to this, both Henry Beauclerc and William Adelin became heirs due to their births.\n\nWait no, let me clarify:\n\n- Row 3: Henry Beauclerc's reason is \"robert 's rebellion,\" meaning he became heir because Robert rebelled against King William II, so it wasn't solely due to his birth. Instead, it was a result of Robert's actions.\n\n- Row 5: William Adelin became heir apparent simply because he was born as the only son, with the reason being \"born.\" So that is definitely due to birth.\n\nSo according to the table, there are at least two people who became heirs due to their births: Henry Beauclerc (but actually no, his reason wasn't birth) and William Adelin. Wait, now I'm confused because in row 3, Henry's reason isn't \"birth.\" Let me correct that.\n\nHenry Beauclerc's reason is \"robert 's rebellion,\" so it's not due to his own birth but due to events caused by Robert Curthose. Therefore, the only person who became heir due to their birth is William Adelin in row 5.\n\nSo if the claim says Henry Beauclerc was the only one who became heir due to birth, that would be false because William Adelin also became an heir due to his birth.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The claim is \"henry beauclerc be the only 1 who became heir due to birth.\" From the table:\n\n- Henry Beauclerc's reason: \"robert 's rebellion\" (so not due to birth)\n- William Adelin's reason: \"born\" (due to birth)\n- Empress Matilda's reason: \"brother died\" (not due to her own birth, but because her brother died)\n\nSo only William Adelin became an heir due to his birth. Therefore, the claim that Henry was the only one is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"reason\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"reason\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"only 3 heirs have daughter as their relationship to monarch\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that there are exactly three individuals who were heirs and had a 'daughter' relationship with the monarch. So, I need to look through each row of the table and check the \"relationship to monarch\" column for any entries where it says 'daughter'.\n\nLooking at the columns provided: heir, status, relationship to monarch, became heir, reason, ceased to be heir, monarch.\n\nI'll go through each data row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Robert Curthose's relationship is \"son\". Not a daughter.\n2. **Row 1**: The entire row says \"succession unclear...\" in all columns except the last which is \"William I\". So, no specific relationship here; it's unclear and doesn't mention a daughter.\n3. **Row 2**: Robert Curthose again, relationship is \"elder brother\". Not a daughter.\n4. **Row 3**: Henry Beauclerc, relationship is \"younger brother\". Also not a daughter.\n5. **Row 4**: Another succession unclear period. No specific individual or relationship mentioned beyond the uncertainty. So no daughter here either.\n6. **Row 5**: William Adelin's relationship is \"only son\". Still a son, not a daughter.\n7. **Row 6**: Empress Matilda's relationship is \"only child\". Nowhere does it say 'daughter' explicitly; it just says she's the only child.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should consider if 'only child' could imply being a daughter. However, since the claim specifically mentions 'daughter', we can't assume that unless it's stated. The table doesn't have any entry where \"relationship to monarch\" is 'daughter'.\n\nSo, going through all rows, none of them list a 'daughter' as their relationship to the monarch. Therefore, there are zero heirs with such a relationship, which means the claim stating there are three is definitely false.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells would include checking each \"relationship to monarch\" entry across all rows.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that exactly three heirs have a 'daughter' relationship.

I need to verify both parts of this statement against the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: \"heir\", \"status\", \"relationship to monarch\", \"became heir\", \"reason\", \"ceased to be heir\", and \"monarch\". Each row contains data corresponding to these columns for different individuals.\n\nI'll start by identifying the relevant rows for Robert Curthose and Empress Matilda. Scanning through the data array:\n\n1. The first row is about Robert Curthose, indicating he became heir in 1066.\n2. The second row seems to be a placeholder indicating an unclear succession between 1077-1087.\n3. The third row again mentions Robert Curthose becoming heir in 1087 under William II.\n4.

However, looking at Robert Curthose's entries:\n\n- In the first row (index 0), he became heir in 1066.\n- In the third row (index 2), he again became heir in 1087.\n\nThere's no mention of him becoming heir in 1094. The claim suggests that Robert became heir in 1094, which isn't supported by any of the rows in the table.

Not relevant.\n\nRow 5: William Adelin as heir apparent, only son of Henry I. He became heir in 1103 and ceased in November 25, 1120. The reason is not specified here, but historically, he died in a shipwreck.\n\nRow 6: Empress Matilda as heiress presumptive, only child of Henry I. She became heir on November 25, 1120 (when William Adelin died) and was proclaimed in 1127. She ceased to be heir on December 1, 1135.\n\nNow, checking the claim:\n\n- The claim says William Adelin ceased being heir on August 5, 1119. However, according to the table (Row 5), he ceased in November 25, 1120. So the date doesn't match; that's a problem.\n\n- Next, Empress Matilda followed him 21 years later. Let's calculate: If William Adelin stopped being heir in November 1120, adding 21 years would bring us to around November 1141. But the claim says she became heir 21 years after August 5, 1119, which would be August 5, 1140. However, according to the table (Row 6), Empress Matilda became heir on November 25, 1120 (the same day William Adelin ceased) and was proclaimed in 1127. There's no 21-year gap; she took over almost immediately after his death.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are incorrect: the date when William Adelin ceased being heir is wrong, and the timeline between his ceasing and Matilda becoming heir isn't 21 years later but much sooner.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"ceased to be heir\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"robert curthose be the heir 2 time, in 1082 and 1094\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that Robert Curthose was an heir twice, specifically in the years 1082 and 1094. My task is to check if the table supports this claim or not.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it has several columns: \"heir\", \"status\", \"relationship to monarch\", \"became heir\", \"reason\", \"ceased to be heir\", and \"monarch\". Each row in the data represents a different heir and their status during certain periods.\n\nI'll start by identifying all rows where Robert Curthose is listed as the heir. Scanning through the data:\n\n1. The first row (index 0) shows Robert Curthose as the heir, becoming heir in 1066, ceasing in 1077.\n2. The third row (index 2) again lists him as heir, starting in 1087 and ceasing in 1088.\n\nWait a minute, these are two instances where Robert Curthose is listed as the heir. But according to the claim, he was an heir in 1082 and 1094. Let me check the \"became heir\" column for his entries.\n\nIn row 0, the year he became heir is 1066, not 1082 or 1094. In row 2, it's 1087. Neither of these matches the years mentioned in the claim. The claim mentions 1082 and 1094 as the years when Robert was an heir. However, based on the data provided, he became heir in 1066 and then again in 1087.\n\nSo, while it's true that Robert Curthose was an heir twice (as per rows 0 and 2), the specific years mentioned in the claim don't align with those in the table. The years 1082 and 1094 aren't present in any of the relevant cells for his entries.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it attributes the wrong years to Robert Curthose's reign as heir.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
