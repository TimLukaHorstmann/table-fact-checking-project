The claim states: \"Jessica Shepley receive a winner's share of 14000 when she win the beaver meadow golf course tournament.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to identify the key pieces of information:\n- The person in question is Jessica Shepley.\n- Her winner's share was $14,000.\n- The location of the tournament is Beaver Meadow Golf Course.\n\nNow, I'll look through the table data for rows where the champion is Jessica Shepley. Scanning the 'champion' column:\n- In row index 2 (since JSON arrays are zero-indexed), the champion is \"jessica shepley\".\n\nNext, I need to verify two things from this row:\n1. The location of the tournament: Checking the 'tournament location' column in row 2 shows it's \"beaver meadow golf course\", which matches the claim.\n2. The winner's share: Looking at the 'winner's share' column in row 2, it is listed as 14000, which aligns with the $14,000 mentioned.\n\nBoth pieces of information from the claim are correctly reflected in the table for Jessica Shepley. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"tournament location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner's share\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It states that in the year 2012, the champion was from the United States. So I need to check two things: for the row where the year is 2012, what's the country of the champion?\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are \"year\" and \"country\", among others. Each data row corresponds to a specific tournament, so I should find the row with the year 2012.\n\nLet me scan through each row:\n\n- The first row is for 2013: that's not relevant.\n- Second row is 2012: this is the one we need. Let's look at the \"champion\" and \"country\" columns here. The champion is Jenny Gleason, and her country is the United States.\n\nSo the claim states that in 2012, the champion was from the United States. Based on the data, that's accurate because Jenny Gleason represents the United States.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are the \"year\" column for row 1 (index starts at 0) and the \"country\" column in the same row to confirm the champion's nationality.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"after 2012 the winner's share be never less than 15000\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that after the year 2012, the winner's share in each tournament was never less than $15,000. So I need to check all entries in the table where the year is later than 2012 and see if any of them have a winner's share below $15,000.\n\nLooking at the table, it has data from 2004 up to 2013. The years after 2012 would be 2013 only in this case because 2012 is included and we need to check for years strictly after that.\n\nSo I'll start by identifying all rows where the year is greater than 2012. From the data provided, the first row corresponds to 2013, which is after 2012. \n\nNext, I'll look at the \"winner's share\" column for these rows. The \"winner's share\" for 2013 is $15,000, as shown in the data array under the last element of that row.\n\nNow, since there are no other years after 2013 in this table (the next year would be beyond the provided data), I can conclude based on the available information. \n\nThe claim says that after 2012, the winner's share was never less than $15,000. The only relevant row is 2013 with a winner's share of exactly $15,000. Therefore, there are no instances where it went below that amount in the given data.\n\nSo, the claim holds true based on the information provided.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that after 2012, specifically in 2013, the winner's share is exactly 15,000. There are no years beyond 2013 to check for a lower amount, so the claim stands.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winner's share\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"champion jenny shin share 14000 dollar when she win\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It states that Jenny Shin was a champion and her share was $14,000. So I need to check two things: whether Jenny Shin is listed as a champion in the table, and if so, what her winner's share was.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are year, dates, champion, country, score, tournament location, purse, and winner's share. The relevant columns here are \"champion\" and \"winner's share\".\n\nI'll go through each row to find where the champion is Jenny Shin. Scanning down:\n\n- 2013: pk kongkraphan\n- 2012: jenny gleason\n- 2011: jessica shepley\n- 2010: jenny shin\n- 2009: misun cho\n- 2008: mo martin\n- 2007: ji min jeong\n- 2006: charlotte mayorkas\n- 2005: kyeong bae\n- 2004: erica blasberg\n\nSo, Jenny Shin is the champion in the year 2010. Now, checking her winner's share for that year. The row for 2010 shows the winner's share as $15,400. \n\nThe claim says she shared $14,000, but according to the table, it's $15,400. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cells are from row index 3 (since indexing starts at 0) for both \"champion\" and \"winner 's share\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winner  's share\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"there be zero purse after 2012 that have a winner's share of less than 15400\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It states that starting from 2013 onwards (since it's \"after 2012\"), there are no tournaments where the purse amount is such that the winner's share is less than $15,400. \n\nLooking at the table structure, I see columns for \"year\", \"purse\", and \"winner's share\". The years in question start from 2013 to 2010, but since the claim is about after 2012, I should focus on rows where the year is 2013 or later. However, in the provided data, the earliest year is 2004, and the latest is 2013.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the data, the years go from 2004 to 2013. So \"after 2012\" would be just the 2013 row because 2013 is after 2012, and then there's nothing beyond that in the table.\n\nLet me list out the relevant rows:\n\n- Row index 0: Year 2013, winner's share $15,000\n- Row index 1: Year 2012 (excluded because it's not after 2012)\n- Other rows are from earlier years and thus not relevant.\n\nSo the only row to consider is the 2013 entry. The winner's share in that year was $15,000, which is less than $15,400. \n\nTherefore, there exists a purse after 2012 (specifically in 2013) where the winner's share is less than $15,400. This means the claim is FALSE because it contradicts the data.\n\nNow, to collect the relevant cells:\n\n- For row index 0, I need both \"year\" and \"winner's share\" columns.\n- Row index 0: year is 2013 (to confirm it's after 2012)\n- Row index 0: winner's share is $15,000 (which is less than $15,400)\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n- {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n- {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"}\n\nWait, but in the table data, the winner's share for 2013 is $15,000. So it's less than 15400.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there is a case after 2012 where the winner's share is below 15400.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
