    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"when marseille be the first team, the first leg's score be 3 - 1\".\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the JSON table. It has columns: \"team 1\", \"agg\", \"team 2\", \"1st leg\", and \"2nd leg\". The data consists of multiple rows where each row represents a match between two teams, their aggregate scores, and the results of the first and second legs.\n\nThe claim is about Marseille being the first team in a row and checking if the first leg's score is 3-1. So I need to look through each row and find instances where \"team 1\" is \"marseille\".\n\nLooking at the data array:\n\nRow indices go from 0 to 7.\n\nChecking each row:\n- Row 0: team1 is anderlecht\n- Row 1: rangers\n- Row2: bolton wanderers\n- Row3: bayer leverkusen\n- Row4: benfica\n- Row5: fiorentina\n- Row6: tottenham hotspur\n- Row7: marseille\n\nSo, in row index 7, \"team 1\" is \"marseille\". Now I need to check what the first leg score is for this row.\n\nIn that same row, under the column \"1st leg\", the value is \"0 - 2\".\n\nThe claim says the first leg's score should be 3-1 when marseille is team1. But according to the table, it's 0-2. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table in JSON format. The claim states: \"the 1st leg score and the 2nd leg score be the same for the bolton wanderer.\"\n\nFirst, I should locate Bolton Wanderers in the data. Looking at the 'team 1' column, I see that Bolton Wanderers are listed in row index 2.\n\nNext, I need to check both the '1st leg' and '2nd leg' scores for this team. The relevant columns here are \"1st leg\" and \"2nd leg\".\n\nLooking at row index 2:\n- The '1st leg' score is \"1 - 1\".\n- The '2nd leg' score is \"0 - 1\".\n\nI compare these two scores: the first leg is a draw (1-1), while the second leg is a loss for Bolton Wanderers with a score of 0-1. They are not the same.\n\nTherefore, the claim that both legs have the same score is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks if the 1st and 2nd leg scores for Bolton Wanderers are identical. Reviewing their respective scores shows they differ.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
