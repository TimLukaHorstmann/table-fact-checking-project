The claim says: \"when the 1st leg be 1 - 2 the club be paok fc in the 2011 - 12 uefa europa league.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what this claim is saying. It seems to refer to a match where the first leg had a score of 1-2, and the club involved was PAOK FC during the 2011-12 UEFA Europa League.\n\nI'll start by looking through the table for entries related to PAOK FC in the 2011-12 season. Scanning through the rows, I notice a few entries under \"2011-12 uefa europa league.\" Specifically, row indexes 34 and 35 mention matches against PAOK FC.\n\nLooking at these rows:\n\nRow 34:\n- Season: 2011 - 12 uefa europa league\n- Competition: uefa europa league\n- Round: group stages\n- Opponent: paok fc\n- Score: 1 - 2\n\nRow 35:\n- Season: same as above\n- Competition: same\n- Round: same\n- Opponent: paok fc\n- Score: 1 - 3\n\nSo, in row 34, the score is 1-2 against PAOK FC. This matches the claim's first leg result of 1-2 and identifies PAOK FC as the club involved in that match during the specified season.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in row 34 where the score was 1-2 against PAOK FC in the 2011-12 UEFA Europa League.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 34,\n       \"column_name\": \"Score\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 34,\n       \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 34,\n       \"column_name\": \"Season\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

Then, in the 2011-12 season, Flora Tallinn had a first leg score of 1-0.\n\nI'll look through each row to find matches from those seasons.\n\nStarting with the 2010-11 season:\n\nLooking at rows where \"Season\" is \"2010-11 uefa europa league\". There are two such entries. The first one mentions Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv FC with a score of 1-1 in the second qualifying round. The second entry is against Juventus, with a score of 0-1 in the third qualifying round.\n\nSo for the claim about Juventus: In the 2010-11 season, their first leg was indeed 0-1 against someone (probably Bnei Yehuda or another opponent), but the table only shows the match against Juventus as 0-1. So that part checks out.\n\nNow for the 2011-12 season:\n\nI need to find FC Flora Tallinn's first leg score in their matches. Looking at rows with \"Season\" as \"2011-12 uefa champions league\" and \"2011-12 uefa europa league\".\n\nIn the champions league, there are two relevant entries: against FC Flora Tallinn with a 1-0 score in the second qualifying round, and another against FK Ekranas with 0-0.

The claim mentions a \"largest first leg,\" which likely refers to the scoreline of the first match (leg) in a two-legged tie, such as in knockout competitions where teams play twice against each other. The specific score mentioned is 0-7, and it's attributed to G\u00f3rnik Zabrze during the 1994-95 season.\n\nNext, I'll look at the provided data table to see if this information exists. The table has columns: Season, Competition, Round, Opponent, and Score. Each row represents a match or a leg of a competition.\n\nI'll scan through each row to find any entries related to G\u00f3rnik Zabrze in the 1994-95 season. Looking at the data:\n\n- The first few rows don't mention G\u00f3rnik Zabrze.\n- Then, I see a row: \"1994 95\", Competition is \"uefa champions league,\" Round is \"second qualifying round,\" Opponent is \"gornik zabrze,\" and Score is \"0 - 7.\"\n\nWait, that's interesting. The score here is 0-7, which matches the claim. But I need to confirm if this is indeed the largest first leg for G\u00f3rnik Zabrze in that season.\n\nI'll check all other rows to ensure there are no other matches for G\u00f3rnik Zabrze in the 1994-95 season with a higher score or different details. Scanning through, it seems this is the only entry for G\u00f3rnik Zabrze in that specific season.\n\nSo, the claim states that the largest first leg was 0-7 for G\u00f3rnik Zabrze in the 1994-95 season. The data supports this exactly as there's a match with that score against Gornik Zabrze in that season.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are from row index 27 (assuming rows start at 0), specifically the Season, Opponent, and Score columns. However, since the user asked for relevant cells to verify the claim, I'll focus on the columns that confirm G\u00f3rnik Zabrze's score: 'Opponent' and 'Score'.\n\nWait, but in the table provided, it's \"gornik zabrze\" as the opponent with a score of 0 -7. The team name is written as \"gornik zabrze,\" which might be the same as G\u00f3rnik Zabrze considering different spellings or translations.\n\nSo, I can confirm that this row matches the claim, making the statement TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to verify a claim about two football clubs, Celtic and AC Omonia, regarding their first legs in some matches. The claim states that both had a 0-1 score in the first leg.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is referring to. It mentions \"the 1st leg\" which likely refers to the first match in a two-legged tie, such as in knockout stages of competitions like the Champions League or Europa League. So, for both Celtic and AC Omonia, there should be entries where their first legs resulted in a 0-1 score.\n\nLooking at the data provided, it's structured in rows with various columns: \"Competition\", \"Round\", \"Opponent\", and \"Score\". The claim is about specific scores, so I'm particularly interested in the \"Score\" column. \n\nI'll go through each row to find any mentions of Celtic or AC Omonia and check if their score was 0-1.\n\nStarting with Celtic:\n- Scanning through the rows, I find a row where the Opponent is Celtic. The row index here is 32. The Score for this match is 0-4. That's not 0-1, so this doesn't support the claim about Celtic having a 0-1 score.\n\nNext, checking for AC Omonia:\n- I look through all rows to see if AC Omonia is listed as an Opponent. Scanning through each row from index 0 upwards, I don't find any entry where AC Omonia is mentioned. This means there's no data in the provided table about a match involving AC Omonia.\n\nSince the claim requires both Celtic and AC Omonia to have a 0-1 score in their respective first legs, but the data shows Celtic had a 0-4 and there's no data for AC Omonia, the claim isn't supported by the given table. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying and then checking the relevant information from the table.\n\nFirst, the claim states that PAOK FC did not participate in the 2011-12 Europa League. To verify this, I need to look through the data provided to see if there are any entries related to PAOK FC in that specific season of the Europa League.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has several columns: \"Competition\" and \"Opponent Team\". The claim is about PAOK FC's participation, so I should focus on these two columns. Specifically, I need to check if there are any rows where the competition is the 2011-12 Europa League and the opponent team is PAOK FC.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 54: Competition is \"2011-12 uefa europa league\", Opponent Team is \"fc rubin kazan\" \u2013 not PAOK.\nRow 55: Same competition, Opponent is \"tottenham hotspur fc\" \u2013 nope.\nRow 56: Competition same, Opponent \"paok fc\" \u2013 this is the first mention of PAOK in the 2011-12 Europa League. The score here is 1-2.\nRow 57: Same competition, Opponent again \"paok fc\", score 1-3.\nRows 58 and 59: Still same competition but different opponents.\n\nSo there are multiple rows where PAOK FC is listed as the opponent team in the 2011-12 Europa League. This indicates that PAOK FC did participate in that league, contradicting the claim which says they didn't play in it.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the data shows that PAOK FC was indeed a participant in the 2011-12 Europa League.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"paok fc do not play in the 2011-12 europa league\" is false as there are multiple entries showing their participation.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 56, \"column_name\": \"Competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 56, \"column_name\": \"Opponent Team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 57, \"column_name\": \"Competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 57, \"column_name\": \"Opponent Team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find any entries related to Juventus FC and the 2010-11 UEFA Europa League. Scanning through the rows:\n\nI see a few entries under the \"Competition\" column mentioning \"2010-11 uefa europa league\". Let's focus on those.\n\nLooking at row index 43:\n- Competition: \"2010  - 11 uefa europa league\"\n- Opponent: \"bnei yehuda tel aviv fc\"\n- Result: \"1  - 1\"\n\nRow index 44:\n- Competition: \"2010  - 11 uefa europa league\"\n- Opponent: \"juventus fc\"\n- Result: \"0  - 1\"\n\nWait, in row 44, the opponent is Juventus FC, and the result is 0-1. That means the score was 0 for one team and 1 for the other. But I'm not sure which team is which here\u2014whether it's our team (the subject of the claim) that didn't score or if they scored.\n\nWait, the claim is about whether Juventus FC did not score in the first leg. So if the result was 0-1 against them, does that mean we scored 0 and they scored 1? Or vice versa?\n\nWait, no, the way it's written is \"Result\" as \"0 - 1\". Typically, the first number represents the home team's score, and the second is the away team. But I don't know which team was at home here.\n\nBut in any case, looking specifically for a game where Juventus FC played and whether they scored or not.\n\nLooking back at row 43: The opponent is \"bnei yehuda tel aviv fc\" with a result of 1-1. So that's a draw. But the claim isn't about this match.\n\nRow 44: Opponent is Juventus FC, and the result is 0-1. So if we consider that our team (the one whose record is in the table) played against Juventus, and the score was 0 for us and 1 for them, then Juventus scored a goal in that leg.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about the first leg of the 2010-11 UEFA Europa League. So I need to see if there's another entry where the opponent is Juventus FC, but perhaps with a different result or stage.\n\nLooking further down, rows 45 and beyond are from 2011-12 season, so they don't apply here.\n\nSo in row 44, the result was 0-1 against Juventus FC. That suggests that Juventus scored once. Therefore, the claim that \"juventus fc do not score a goal in the first leg\" would be false because they did score one goal.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding which team is which. If our team didn't score (0) and Juventus scored 1, then indeed Juventus did score. So the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, if the result was 0-1 in favor of our team, meaning we scored 0 and they scored 1? Wait no, typically it's home team first. But without knowing who was at home, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut regardless, the result shows that Juventus FC scored at least one goal because the away score is 1 (assuming the opponent is the away team). So if the row says \"juventus fc\" as the opponent and the result is 0-1, that would mean our team scored 0 and Juventus scored 1. Therefore, they did score a goal.\n\nHence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Juventus FC didn't score in the first leg of the 2010-11 UEFA Europa League.

Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 44, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 44, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

That's my starting point.\n\nNext, I need to check if any team scored more than 6 goals in the first leg during that season. The claim specifies the \"first leg,\" but looking at the columns provided, there's no separate column for \"First Leg Goals.\" Instead, there are columns like \"AwayTeam\", \"HomeTeam\", and \"Goals\". It seems each row represents a single match with its respective goals.\n\nIn the 1994-95 season entry (row index 26), under the \"Goals\" column, it shows \"0 - 3\".

So I'm looking for two specific matches from 2003: one in the first round of the Intertoto Cup where the result was a tie (i.e., the score is something like x-x), and another in the second round that also resulted in a tie.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like Season, Competition, Stage, Opponent, and Result. The relevant columns are \"Season\", \"Competition\", \"Stage\", and \"Result\".\n\nI'll go through each row to find entries from 2003 related to the Intertoto Cup.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- Row indices start at 0. Let's check each row:\n\nRow 0: Season is 1985/86, not relevant.\n...\nContinue until I reach rows with Season 2003.\n\nLooking through, I find two relevant rows for 2003 under the Intertoto Cup:\n- Row index 41: Season 2003, Competition UEFA Intertoto Cup, Stage First Round, Opponent Odra Wodzis\u0142aw, Result 2-1. This is a win, not a tie.\n- Row index 42: Season 2003, Competition UEFA Intertoto Cup, Stage Second Round, Opponent FC Slovan Liberec, Result 0-2. Again, not a tie.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions both first and second rounds having ties in the first leg. But according to these rows, neither of them resulted in a tie; one was a win (2-1) and the other a loss (0-2). \n\nHowever, wait, I might have missed something. Let me double-check if there are any other rows from 2003 Intertoto Cup with ties.\n\nLooking again:\nRow 43 is about the Champions League in 2011/12, so not relevant.\nNo other rows for 2003. So both matches were decisive (no tie), which contradicts the claim that both first and second rounds had a tie.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because neither of the legs resulted in a tie; one was a win and the other a loss.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both the first and second rounds of the 2003 UEFA Intertoto Cup had tied results. Checking the table:\n\n- First Round: Result was 2-1 (a win, not a tie).\n- Second Round: Result was 0-2 (a loss, not a tie).\n\nThus, neither match resulted in a tie.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 41, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 42, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to verify the claim: \"Celtic and Omonia never have a first leg of 0 - 1.\" Let's start by understanding what this means. The claim is stating that in all their matches (specifically the first legs), neither Celtic nor Omonia has ever had a score of 0-1.\n\nLooking at the data provided, I see a list of rows with various columns: Season, Competition, Round, Opponent, and Score. My task is to check each row where either Celtic or Omonia are involved in the first leg (I assume this means looking for the specific 'Round' entries that denote the first leg) and see if any of their scores are 0-1.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 8: Season \"2011 - 12\", Competition \"uefa champions league\", Round \"third qualifying round\", Opponent \"fc copenhagen\", Score \"0 - 1\". Here, the opponent is Copenhagen, not Celtic or Omonia. So this isn't relevant.\n\nWait, actually, in the data provided, I should look for when either Celtic or Omonia are listed as opponents. Let me check all rows where Opponent is either Celtic or Omonia.\n\nLooking through all 32 rows:\n\nRow 8: Opponent \"fc copenhagen\" \u2192 Not relevant.\nRow 9: Opponent \"paok fc\", \"Score 1 - 2\"\nRow 10: Same as row 9, score 1 - 3\nRow 11: Opponent \"fc rubin kazan\", Score 1 - 4\nRow 12: Opponent \"tottenham hotspur fc\", Score 0 - 4\nRow 13: Season \"2011 - 12 uefa europa league\", Competition, Round \"group stages\", Opponent \"paok fc\", Score 1 - 1\nRow 14: Same as row 13, but different score.\nWait, perhaps I'm missing rows. Let me list all opponents:\n\nLooking back, the opponents are:\n\n- bnei yehuda tel aviv fc (row 29)\n- juventus fc (row 30)\n- flora tallinn (row 31)\n- copenhagen (row 32)\n- partizan (row 33)\n- rubin kazan (rows 34, 36)\n- tottenham hotspur (rows 35, 37)\n- paok fc (rows 38, 39)\n- ekranas (row 40)\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me recount the rows as per the JSON structure.\n\nThe data has an array of 32 elements (indices 0 to 31). Each element is a row with columns: Season, Competition, Round, Opponent, Score.\n\nLooking through each row's 'Opponent' column:\n\nRow 8: Opponent \"fc copenhagen\" \u2192 Not relevant.\nRow 9: Opponent \"paok fc\"\nRow 10: Same as row 9\nRow 11: Opponent \"fc rubin kazan\"\nRow 12: Opponent \"tottenham hotspur fc\"\nRow 13: Opponent \"fk partizan\"\nRow 14: Opponent \"fc rubin kazan\" again\nRow 15: Same as row 12\nRow 16: Opponent \"paok fc\" again\nRow 17: Same as row 16\nRow 18: Opponent \"fk partizan\"\nRow 19: Opponent \"fc rubin kazan\"\nRow 20: Opponent \"tottenham hotspur fc\" again\nRow 21: Opponent \"paok fc\" again\nRow 22: Opponent \"fc rubin kazan\" again\nRow 23: Same as row 20\nRow 24: Opponent \"fk partizan\"\nRow 25: Opponent \"juventus fc\"\nRow 26: Opponent \"bnei yehuda tel aviv fc\"\nRow 27: Opponent \"fc flora tallinn\"\nRow 28: Opponent \"fc copenhagen\" again\nRow 29: Opponent \"odra wodzislaw\"\nRow 30: Opponent \"fc slovan liberec\"\nRow 31: Opponent \"ekranas\"\n\nWait, I'm not seeing any rows where the opponent is Celtic or Omonia. That's odd because in reality, both teams have participated in various European competitions.\n\nBut according to this data, neither Celtic nor Omonia are listed as opponents in any of the rows provided. Therefore, there's no instance where either of them has a score of 0-1 in their first legs within the given dataset.\n\nSo, based on the data, the claim holds true because there's no record of either team having that specific score.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified as true. Neither Celtic nor Omonia appear as opponents in the provided data, hence there are no instances where they have a 0-1 first leg score.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nNeither Celtic nor Omonia are listed as opponents in any of the rows provided, so there are no instances of them having a 0-1 score. The claim is supported by the given data.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{True}}",
