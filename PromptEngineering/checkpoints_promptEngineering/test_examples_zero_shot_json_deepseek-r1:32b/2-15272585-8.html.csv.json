    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"galina voskoboeva play a total of 3 games on a hard tennis court\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the JSON data provided. It has columns: outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, and score. Each row in the data represents a match that Galina Voskoboeva played. The claim mentions three games on hard courts, so I need to check each row for the surface type.\n\nLooking at the first row (row index 0), the surface is \"hard (i)\". That counts as a hard court game. So that's one.\n\nThe second row (index 1) also has the surface listed as \"hard (i)\", so another hard court match. Now we have two.\n\nThird row (index 2): The surface here is \"clay\", which doesn't count, so I'll skip this one.\n\nFourth row (index 3): The surface is \"hard\". That's a third hard court game. So that brings the total to three.\n\nThe fifth row (index 4) has a clay surface again, so it doesn't add to our count.\n\nSo, adding up the rows where the surface was hard: rows 0, 1, and 3. That makes three games in total on hard courts. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if the claim \"galina voskoboeva have an equal winrate between both clay and hard court\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim means. The name mentioned is Galina Voskoboeva, but looking at the table, I don't see her name anywhere. All the rows list different opponents like Matea Mezak, Oleksandra Kravets, Roberta Vinci, Lilia Osterloh, and Alice Canepa. So, it seems Galina isn't directly mentioned in this table.\n\nNext, the claim talks about win rates on clay and hard courts. Win rate usually refers to the percentage of matches won versus lost on each surface type. But without data about Galina's wins and losses, it's impossible to calculate her win rate. The table only shows outcomes as \"winner\" or \"runner-up,\" but not specifically for Galina.\n\nLooking at the 'surface' column, there are entries like \"hard (i)\", \"clay\", etc., so that part is relevant. However, since the opponent isn't Galina in any of these rows, we can't use this data to assess her performance.\n\nTherefore, the table doesn't provide any information about Galina Voskoboeva's match outcomes or win rates on different surfaces. Without this data, the claim cannot be verified as either TRUE or FALSE based solely on the given table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to Galina Voskoboeva, but the table lists other opponents, not her. Therefore, there's no relevant data about her performance.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"galina voskoboeva never play the same opponent more than 1 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Galina Voskoboeva didn't face the same opponent more than once in her matches as recorded in the table. So, my task is to check if any of her opponents appear more than once in the data provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match she played. The columns are \"outcome,\" \"date,\" \"tournament,\" \"surface,\" \"opponent,\" and \"score.\" I'm particularly interested in the \"opponent\" column since that's what the claim is about.\n\nNow, let me go through each row and note down the opponents:\n\n1. First row: Opponent is Matea Mezak.\n2. Second row: Opponent is Oleksandra Kravets.\n3. Third row: Opponent is Roberta Vinci.\n4. Fourth row: Opponent is Lilia Osterloh.\n5. Fifth row: Opponent is Alice Canepa.\n\nSo, the opponents listed are Matea Mezak, Oleksandra Kravets, Roberta Vinci, Lilia Osterloh, and Alice Canepa. I can see that each of these names appears only once in the \"opponent\" column across all five rows. There's no repetition; every opponent is unique.\n\nTherefore, based on the data provided, Galina Voskoboeva did not play against the same opponent more than once. Each match was against a different player.\n\nTo make sure I'm thorough, I should check if there are any other opponents beyond these five in the table, but looking at the data, there's only one opponent per row, and none of them repeat. So, it seems clear that each opponent is unique to their respective matches.\n\nHence, the claim holds true because all her opponents in the listed tournaments were different.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}]}\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the claim \"on average, galina voskoboeva lose with only 4 points\" is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The key elements are:\n\n1. Galina Voskoboeva's performance.\n2. She loses her matches.\n3. On average, she loses with only 4 points.\n\nLooking at the table provided in JSON format, it has columns: outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, score.\n\nI notice that each row represents a match result. The relevant information here would be the \"outcome\" and the \"score\".\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Outcome is \"runner-up\". That means she lost this match. The score is \"6-4, 4-6, 4-6\". I think that's three sets. So in this case, how many points did she have? Well, each set has a certain number of games, but the claim is about points. However, the table only shows game scores, not individual points. Wait, so maybe the \"score\" column represents game points, like 6-4 meaning she won 6 games and lost 4 in that set. But the claim talks about points, which might be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The score is in terms of games, not points. So each number represents the number of games won by each player in that set. For example, \"6-4\" means she won 6 games and her opponent won 4 in that set.\n\nSo if she lost a match (outcome is runner-up), we can look at how many total games she had across all sets to see if on average it's around 4 points. But wait, the claim says \"only 4 point\", which I think might be a typo and should be \"points\". But regardless, let's proceed.\n\nLet me list out each match where she lost (outcome is runner-up) and calculate the total number of games she won in those matches.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- **Row 0**: Outcome: runner-up. Score: 6-4, 4-6, 4-6. So her scores are 6,4,4. Total games won by her: 6+4+4 =14.\n- **Row 2**: Outcome: runner-up. Score:3-6,4-6. Her scores:3 and 4. Total games:7.\n- **Row 3**: Outcome: runner-up. Score:6-7,4-6. Her scores:6 and4. Total:10.\n\nSo she lost three matches in the table:\n\nTotal games won in losses:\nRow 0: 14\nRow 2:7\nRow3:10\n\nWait, but that's 14+7+10=31 total games across these three matches where she lost.\n\nThe average number of points (if we consider each game as a point) would be 31 /3 \u224810.33 per match on average in the losses. But the claim says \"only 4 points\" on average, which is way lower than what I'm calculating here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to points per set or something else. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the scores are in terms of sets, not games? No, that doesn't make sense because each set would have a number of games. For example, 6-4 is a common score in a set meaning she won 6 games and lost 4.\n\nSo if we're considering points per game, but the table doesn't show individual point data\u2014it only shows game scores.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"lose with only 4 point\"\u2014maybe it means that on average, each match she loses has her scoring around 4 points in total? That would mean across all her lost matches, her average score is 4 points per match.\n\nBut according to the table:\n\nIn Row0: She had a total of 14 games won (which could be considered as points if each game is worth one point). So that's way more than 4.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting \"points\" here. Perhaps the claim is about how many points she loses by on average? But in Row0, she lost two sets, so perhaps her net loss is (6-4) + (4-6) + (4-6). Wait, that might not make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of games she lost in each set. Let me check:\n\nRow0: She lost two sets with 4 points? No, because in the first set she won 6 and lost 4, but in the second and third sets, she lost both 6-4 and 6-4 again? Wait no, her scores are 6-4, 4-6, 4-6. So she lost two sets where she had 4 points each.\n\nSo in this match, she won one set with 6 games and lost two sets with 4 games each. That's a total of 14 games for her in the match.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is that on average, when she loses, she only scores 4 points across all her matches, but according to the data, she had 14,7,10 in three losses. The average would be (14+7+10)/3 = 21/3=7.\n\nSo on average, she lost with around 7 points per match, not 4.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because her average points in lost matches are higher than 4.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Galina Voskoboeva loses with an average of only 4 points. However, analyzing the table shows that in her losing matches (rows 0, 2, and 3), she had scores totaling 14, 7, and 10 games respectively. The average is approximately 7 points per match, which contradicts the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The columns are outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, and score. There are five rows of data.\n\nThe claim mentions Galina Voskoboeva playing on hard courts three times and once on clay. So I need to check each row for the surfaces and count how many times she played on hard and clay.\n\nLooking at the first row: outcome is runner-up, surface is \"hard (i)\". So that's one hard court game.\n\nSecond row: outcome is winner, surface is \"hard (i)\", so another hard court. That makes two now.\n\nThird row: surface is \"clay\". So that's one clay game.\n\nFourth row: surface is \"hard\", another hard court. Now that's three hard games.\n\nFifth row: surface is \"clay\" again. Wait, but the claim says only one on clay. However, in this table, there are two rows where the surface is clay (rows 2 and 4). Hmm, so according to this data, she has two clay court games, not one as claimed.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The third row's surface is clay, fifth row also clay. So that's two clay games. But the claim says she played one on clay.

The claim says: \"galina voskoboeva play 20% of her game on a clay top tennis court and 1% on hard.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table to see how many games Galina Voskoboeva has played in total. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 0: She was a runner-up on a hard surface.\nRow 1: Winner on hard.\nRow 2: Runner-up on clay.\nRow 3: Runner-up on hard.\nRow 4: Winner on clay.\n\nSo, that's five games in total.\n\nNow, I'll count how many were on clay and how many on hard. \n\nClay surfaces are in rows 2 and 4, so that's 2 games.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"galina voskoboeva have an equal winrate between both clay and hard court but she never win\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim into two parts: \n1. Galina has an equal win rate on both clay and hard courts.\n2. She never wins any matches.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are five rows of data. Each row represents a match outcome with details like date, tournament, surface type, opponent, and score.\n\nI'll check each relevant column to gather information about the surfaces she played on and her outcomes.\n\nThe columns we're interested in are \"outcome\" and \"surface\". \n\nLooking at the \"surface\" column:\n- Row 0: hard (i)\n- Row 1: hard (i)\n- Row 2: clay\n- Row 3: hard\n- Row 4: clay\n\nSo, there are three matches on hard courts (rows 0, 1, 3) and two on clay (rows 2,4).\n\nNow checking the \"outcome\" column for each surface:\n- Hard court outcomes:\n  - Runner-up in rows 0 and 3\n  - Winner in row 1\n- Clay court outcomes:\n  - Runner-up in both rows 2 and 4\n\nSo on hard courts, she has 1 win and 2 losses. On clay, 0 wins and 2 losses.\n\nWait a minute, that's not equal win rates. Her win rate on hard is 33% (1/3), while on clay it's 0%. So the first part of the claim about equal win rates isn't true.\n\nAlso, she did win once on hard court, so the second part stating she never wins is false because there's at least one win.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect. She doesn't have an equal win rate, and she has a win.\n\nLooking back at the relevant cells, I need to collect all rows where surface is clay or hard and outcome is either winner or runner-up.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be every row that mentions clay or hard in \"surface\" and their corresponding \"outcome\".\n\nSo for each row:\n- Row 0: surface is hard (i), outcome is runner-up\n- Row1: surface hard, outcome winner\n- Row2: clay, runner-up\n- Row3: hard, runner-up\n- Row4: clay, runner-up\n\nAll these rows are relevant because they show her performance on different surfaces and outcomes.\n\nSo compiling the relevant cells, each row's \"surface\" and \"outcome\" columns need to be considered.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Galina has a higher win rate on hard courts (1 win out of 3) compared to clay (0 wins), and she did win at least once. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"galina voskoboeva never play the same opponent more than once except in 6 june 2006\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that Galina Voskoboeva did not face the same opponent more than once, except for one instance on June 6, 2006. So, I need to check if any opponent appears more than once in her matches as per the table.\n\nLooking at the \"opponent\" column in each row:\n\nRow 0: Matea Mezak\nRow 1: Oleksandra Kravets\nRow 2: Roberta Vinci\nRow 3: Lilia Osterloh\nRow 4: Alice Canepa\n\nEach opponent is unique; none repeat. So, she didn't face any opponent more than once except for one instance on June 6, 2006. Wait, but according to the data, all opponents are different each time.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"except in 6 june 2006\". Does that mean she played someone twice on that date? Let me check row 4: it's June 6, 2006 against Alice Canepa. She won with a score of 6-1, 6-2. There's only one entry for this opponent.\n\nHmm, so in the data provided, all opponents are unique across all matches. So, she never played the same opponent more than once at all. Therefore, the exception mentioned in the claim doesn't apply because there's no case where an opponent was faced more than once except on that specific date, but even then, it's only one match.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me double-check each row:\n\n- Row 0: Matea Mezak\n- Row 1: Oleksandra Kravets\n- Row 2: Roberta Vinci\n- Row 3: Lilia Osterloh\n- Row 4: Alice Canepa\n\nAll opponents are unique. So, the claim states that except on June 6, she never played anyone more than once. But since all her matches have unique opponents, the exception is moot because there's no instance of playing the same opponent twice. Therefore, the claim is actually TRUE because she never had repeat opponents except possibly implying that on June 6, 2006, she might have, but in reality, even that date only has one opponent.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The table shows no repeated opponents at all, so the claim that she didn't play anyone more than once is TRUE because it's never happened.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Galina Voskoboeva did not face any opponent more than once except possibly on June 6, 2006. However, examining the table shows each opponent is unique across all entries. Therefore, the claim holds as she indeed never played the same opponent more than once.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "on average , galina voskoboeva lose with only 4 point against oleksandra kravets and alice canepa",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"on average, galina voskoboeva lose with only 4 point against oleksandra kravets and alice canepa.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse what this means. It seems like the claim is about Galina Voskoboeva's performance in matches against two specific opponents: Oleksandra Kravets and Alice Canepa. Specifically, it mentions she loses with only 4 points on average against them.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see that each row represents a match outcome for someone\u2014probably Galina. The columns are \"outcome\", \"date\", \"tournament\", \"surface\", \"opponent\", and \"score\". \n\nI need to check if there are any matches where she lost (since the claim says she loses) against these two opponents. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. First row: Outcome is runner-up, opponent is Matea Mezak. So she didn't win here, but the opponent isn't either of the two mentioned.\n2. Second row: Outcome is winner, opponent is Oleksandra Kravets. Wait, if she's the winner, that contradicts the claim which says she loses against Kravets. But maybe I'm misunderstanding; perhaps the table lists her opponents and their outcomes. Let me check who won.\n\nWait, actually, in tennis, a match has two players. The \"outcome\" column likely indicates whether Galina was the winner or runner-up (i.e., lost) in each tournament. So for row 1: she was a runner-up against Matea Mezak. Row 2: she was the winner against Kravets. That would mean she defeated Kravets, not lost to her. But the claim says she loses against Kravets and Canepa on average with only 4 points.\n\nLooking at row 5: Outcome is winner, opponent is Alice Canepa. So again, she won against Canepa as well.\n\nWait a minute, that's conflicting with the claim. The claim states she loses to these two opponents, but according to the table, she actually defeated both Kravets and Canepa. \n\nNow, looking at the scores:\n\nRow 2 (Kravets): Score is 6-4, 6-2. So she won both sets.\nRow 5 (Canepa): Score is 6-1, 6-2. Again, clear wins.\n\nThe claim mentions that on average, she loses with only 4 points. The \"only 4 point\" part might be referring to the number of games or perhaps total points. In tennis, a set is typically won by winning at least 6 games and having at least two more than the opponent. \n\nLooking at row 2: She won 6-4 in the first set and 6-2 in the second. So Kravets scored 4+2=6 points (games) against her. Similarly, in row 5, Canepa had only 1 and 2 games respectively across two sets, totaling 3 games.\n\nWait, but the claim says she loses with only 4 points. If Galina was losing, that would mean she has fewer points than her opponents. But in both these rows, she is the winner, so the scores are of her winning.\n\nTherefore, the claim that she lost to Kravets and Canepa is incorrect because according to the table, she won those matches. So the average part about losing with 4 points doesn't hold because she didn't lose; she won.\n\nAdditionally, looking at other rows: row 3 and 4 are runner-up outcomes against Roberta Vinci and Lilia Osterloh. But the opponents in the claim are Kravets and Canepa, who she defeated.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The table shows that Galina Voskoboeva won against both Oleksandra Kravets and Alice Canepa. Therefore, the claim that she loses with only 4 points on average against them is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Galina voskoboeva lost to two specific opponents with an average of 4 points. However, according to the table, she won both matches against these opponents, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
