    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"when the girl single be lindaweni fanetri, the mixed double be wifqi windarto debby susanto.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's saying that in a particular year, when Lindaweni Fanetri was the girls singles champion, the mixed doubles champions were Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto.\n\nSo, my plan is to go through each row of the table and check for the year where \"girls singles\" is Lindaweni Fanetri. Once I find that row, I'll then look at the \"mixed doubles\" column in the same row to see if it matches Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The columns are: year, boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, mixed doubles.\n  \nI'll go through each data row one by one:\n\n1. 2001: Girls singles is Maria Kristin Yulianti. Not Lindaweni Fanetri.\n2. 2002: Fransisca Ratnasari. No match.\n3. 2003: Wiwis Meilyanna. No.\n4. 2004: Pia Zebadiah. No.\n5. 2005: Bellaetrix Manuputty. No.\n6. 2006: Sylvinna Kurniawan. No.\n7. 2007: Lindaweni Fanetri. Ah, here's the match! So the year is 2007.\n\nNow, in this row (row index 6), I need to check the \"mixed doubles\" column. Let me look at that cell:\n\nIn 2007, mixed doubles are listed as Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto. That's exactly what the claim states.\n\nSo both conditions are met: in the year when Lindaweni Fanetri was the girls singles champion (2007), the mixed doubles champions were indeed Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the 2007 row where both conditions are satisfied.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"girls singles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. So, the claim says: \"when the girl double be ayu pratiwi anggi widia, the boy double be jones ralfy jansen and dandi prabudita.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse this claim correctly. It seems like it's saying that in a particular year when the girls doubles champions were \"ayu pratiwi anggi widia,\" the boys doubles champions were \"jones ralfy jansen\" and \"dandi prabudita.\" \n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a year from 2001 to 2010. The columns are: year, boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, mixed doubles.\n\nSo, my task is to find if there's any year where the \"girls doubles\" column has \"ayu pratiwi anggi widia.\" If such a row exists, I need to check whether in that same year, the \"boys doubles\" column contains both \"jones ralfy jansen\" and \"dandi prabudita.\"\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting from 2001:\n- Girls doubles: lilyana natsir natalia poluakan. Not matching.\n\n2002:\n- Girls doubles: purwati meiliana jauhari. No match.\n\n2003:\n- Girls doubles: pia zebadiah nitya krishinda maheswari. Still no.\n\n2004:\n- Girls doubles: pia zebadiah nitya krishinda maheswari again. Not the target.\n\n2005:\n- Girls doubles: lily siswanti shendy puspa irawati. Doesn't match.\n\n2006:\n- Girls doubles: bellaetrix manuputty samantha lintang. Nope.\n\n2007:\n- Girls doubles: anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati. Not matching.\n\n2008:\n- Girls doubles: suci rizki andini tiara rosalia nuraidah. Still not the target.\n\n2009:\n- Girls doubles: ayu pratiwi anggi widia. Okay, this is a match! So, in 2009, girls doubles are indeed \"ayu pratiwi anggi widia.\"\n\nNow, checking the boys doubles for that same year (2009):\nLooking at the \"boys doubles\" column for row index 8 (since rows start from 0), it's \"jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita.\" So, the pair is listed as a single string. The claim mentions both names, so it seems correct.\n\nTherefore, in 2009, when girls doubles were \"ayu pratiwi anggi widia,\" boys doubles were indeed \"jones ralfy jansen\" and \"dandi prabudita.\" So the claim holds true.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- The row for 2009 (row index 8), checking both \"girls doubles\" and \"boys doubles.\"\n\nThus, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"girls doubles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"boys doubles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"in 2006, the mixed double be danny bawa chrisnanta debby susanto and the boy single be nugroho andi saputro.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim into two parts to check each separately.\n\n1. **Mixed Doubles in 2006:**\n   The claim states that the mixed doubles pair was \"danny bawa chrisnanta debby susanto.\" Looking at the table, I need to find the row for the year 2006 and check the \"mixed doubles\" column.\n\n   From the JSON data:\n   - Year 2006 is in the 5th data entry (index starting from 0: rows are 0-9, so 2006 is at index 5).\n   - The mixed doubles entry for that year is \"danny bawa chrisnanta debby susanto,\" which matches exactly what's claimed. So this part is correct.\n\n2. **Boys Singles in 2006:**\n   The claim mentions that the boys singles winner was \"nugroho andi saputro.\" Checking the table:\n   - In the same row (index 5), under the \"boys singles\" column, the name listed is indeed \"nugroho andi saputro,\" which matches the claim.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a specific claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided in a JSON format. The claim given is: \"In 2007, the girl double be Anneke Feinya Agustin Wenny Setiawati and the mixed double be Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanto.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. Looking at the JSON, it has columns labeled as 'year', 'boys singles', 'girls singles', 'boys doubles', 'girls doubles', and 'mixed doubles'. Each row corresponds to a year from 2001 to 2010.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific pieces of information for the year 2007:\n1. The girls doubles winners are Anneke Feinya Agustin Wenny Setiawati.\n2. The mixed doubles winners are Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanto.\n\nI need to verify each part of this claim against the table data for the year 2007.\n\nStarting with the first part: checking who won the girls doubles in 2007. I'll look at the row corresponding to 2007. In that row, under the 'girls doubles' column, the name listed is \"anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati\". That's an exact match with what the claim states.\n\nNext, checking the mixed doubles winners for 2007. The claim states it's Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanto. Looking at the 'mixed doubles' column in the 2007 row, the names listed are \"wifqi windarto debby susanto\". That also matches exactly.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are accurately represented in the table for the year 2007, the claim is supported by the data provided. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nTo ensure I haven't missed anything, I'll double-check the row indices and column names. The year 2007 is the seventh entry (index 6 if starting from 0). The relevant columns are 'girls doubles' and 'mixed doubles'. Each of these cells in that row matches the claim exactly.\n\nNo discrepancies were found, so my conclusion remains that the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"girls doubles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table in JSON format. The claim states: \"when the girl single be lindaweni fanetri , the mixed double be wifqi windarto debby susanto after the year 2007.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components to understand what needs verification.\n\nThe claim has two main parts:\n1. The girl's singles winner is Lindaweni Fanetri.\n2. In that same row (year), the mixed doubles winners are Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto.\n3. Additionally, it mentions this occurs after the year 2007.\n\nI'll start by looking through each row in the data to find where \"girls singles\" is Lindaweni Fanetri.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- The columns are: year, boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, mixed doubles.\n- Rows are from 2001 to 2010, each representing a different year.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 0 (2001): Girls singles is Maria Kristin Yulianti. Not Lindaweni Fanetri.\nRow 1 (2002): Girls singles is Fransisca Ratnasari. Not Lindaweni Fanetri.\nRow 2 (2003): Girls singles is Wiwis Meilyanna. Not Lindaweni Fanetri.\nRow 3 (2004): Girls singles is Pia Zebadiah. Not Lindaweni Fanetri.\nRow 4 (2005): Girls singles is Bellaetrix Manuputty. Not Lindaweni Fanetri.\nRow 5 (2006): Girls singles is Sylvinna Kurniawan. Not Lindaweni Fanetri.\nRow 6 (2007): Girls singles is Lindaweni Fanetri. This matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNow, I need to check if in this same row (2007), the mixed doubles winners are Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto.\n\nLooking at Row 6's \"mixed doubles\" column: The entry is \"wifqi windarto debby susanto\". This matches exactly with what the claim states. So, both conditions of the claim are met in this row.\n\nNext, I need to verify if this occurred after the year 2007. The row in question is for the year 2007. However, the claim says \"after the year 2007,\" which would mean years 2008 and beyond. Since the event happened exactly in 2007, not after, this part of the claim isn't satisfied.\n\nWait, but I need to be precise here. The claim uses \"after the year 2007,\" which typically means strictly after, i.e., years starting from 2008 onwards. Since the event is in 2007, it doesn't qualify as being after. However, sometimes people might use \"after\" to include the same year. But generally, \"after\" would mean subsequent years.\n\nSo, even though the girl's singles and mixed doubles match the claim, the timing condition isn't met because it's in 2007, not after.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if there are any other rows where Lindaweni Fanetri is the girls singles winner. Looking back at the data:\n\nRow 6 (2007) is the only row where Lindaweni Fanetri is listed as the girl's singles champion. There are no other instances beyond that.\n\nTherefore, since the event happened in 2007 and not after, the claim's condition about it being \"after\" isn't satisfied. Hence, the entire claim isn't fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are from row 6 (2007), checking both the girls singles and mixed doubles entries.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"girls singles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Scanning through the data array, I see that the last entry is for the year 2010. The row index starts at 0, so 2010 should be at index 9.\n\nNext, I'll check the relevant columns for girls doubles and boys doubles in this row. The \"girls doubles\" column for 2010 lists \"aris budiharti dian fitriani,\" which doesn't match \"ayu pratiwi anggi widia.\" So, the claim about the girl double is incorrect.\n\nLooking at the boys doubles, it's listed as \"jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita,\" which does match the names mentioned in the claim.

The claim says: \"In 2009, the mixed double consists of didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu and hermansyah be the boy single.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the year 2009 in the table. Scanning through the data rows, I find that 2009 is the ninth row (since counting starts from zero, it would be index 8). Let me check what each column says for that year.\n\nThe columns are: year, boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, mixed doubles. So for 2009, I'll look at each relevant section.\n\n1. **Mixed Doubles**: The claim mentions \"didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu.\" Looking at the 2009 row under \"mixed doubles,\" it's listed as \"didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu.\" That matches exactly, so that part is correct.\n\n2. **Boys Singles**: The claim states that hermansyah is the boy single. Now, looking at the boys singles column for 2009, I see the name is \"riyanto subagja,\" not hermansyah. Wait a minute, that's different from what the claim says.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check because sometimes names can be similar or there might be a mix-up. Let me check other years to see if hermansyah appears elsewhere. Looking through previous years:\n\n- In 2008 (row index 7), the boys singles is \"hermansyah.\" So in 2008, he was the boy single. But the claim is about 2009, where it's riyanto subagja.\n\nSo putting that together: The mixed doubles part of the claim is correct for 2009, but the boys singles part incorrectly mentions hermansyah instead of riyanto subagja.\n\nTherefore, since part of the claim is incorrect (the boys single), the entire statement isn't fully supported by the table.

The data shows that in 2010, under mixed doubles, it's listed as \"jones ralfy jansen nurbeta kwanrico.\" So part 1 of the claim is incorrect because the mixed doubles team isn't danny and debby but rather jones ralfy jansen and nurbeta.\n\nSince part 1 is false, I don't need to check part 2. But just for thoroughness, in 2006, \"nugroho andi saputro\" was the boys singles champion. So if part 1 were correct (which it's not), part 2 would also be incorrect because in 2010, the boys singles champion wasn't nugroho but someone else.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are false, so the overall answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 2010, mixed doubles were \"danny bawa chrisnanta and debby susanto,\" which isn't accurate according to the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"In 2009, when the girl double be anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati, the mixed double be wifqi windarto debby susanto.\"\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each part of the claim is referring to. The claim mentions two specific entries for the year 2009: one in the \"girls doubles\" column and another in the \"mixed doubles\" column.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns named \"year\", \"boys singles\", \"girls singles\", \"boys doubles\", \"girls doubles\", and \"mixed doubles\". Each row corresponds to a year from 2001 to 2010.\n\nI need to find the row where the year is 2009. Let me go through each row's first element until I find 2009. Scanning through:\n\n- Row 0: 2001\n- Row 1: 2002\n- Row 2: 2003\n- Row 3: 2004\n- Row 4: 2005\n- Row 5: 2006\n- Row 6: 2007\n- Row 7: 2008\n- Row 8: 2009\n\nSo, the row for 2009 is at index 8.\n\nNow, I'll check the \"girls doubles\" entry in this row. The claim states it should be \"anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati\". Let me look at column name \"girls doubles\" in row 8:\n\nIn row 8, the \"girls doubles\" value is \"ayu pratiwi anggi widia\". Wait, that's different from what the claim says. Hmm, did I get the right row? Let me double-check.\n\nRow index 8: The columns are:\n- year: 2009\n- boys singles: riyanto subagja\n- girls singles: ana rovita\n- boys doubles: jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita\n- girls doubles: ayu pratiwi anggi widia\n- mixed doubles: didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu\n\nSo, the \"girls doubles\" in 2009 is indeed \"ayu pratiwi anggi widia\", not \"anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati\". That means part of the claim about the girls doubles might be incorrect. But wait, maybe I made a mistake because I thought it was row 6 for 2007? Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, in row 8 (index 8), which is the 9th element in data array starting from index 0, the year is 2009. The \"girls doubles\" there is \"ayu pratiwi anggi widia\". So the claim's first part is wrong.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm confusing the years. Let me recount the rows:\n\n- Index 0: 2001\n- Index 1: 2002\n- Index 2: 2003\n- Index 3: 2004\n- Index 4: 2005\n- Index 5: 2006\n- Index 6: 2007\n- Index 7: 2008\n- Index 8: 2009\n- Index 9: 2010\n\nYes, row index 8 is 2009. So the \"girls doubles\" in that year is \"ayu pratiwi anggi widia\". Therefore, the claim's first part is incorrect because it says \"anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati\", which doesn't match.\n\nWait, but looking back at row 6 (2007), the girls doubles are \"anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati\". So that was in 2007. Therefore, the claim incorrectly attributes this to 2009.\n\nBut let me also check the mixed doubles part as per the claim: it says the mixed doubles should be \"wifqi windarto debby susanto\". Let's look at row 8's \"mixed doubles\" column.\n\nIn row 8 (2009), the mixed doubles are \"didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu\", which doesn't match the claim. So both parts of the claim are incorrect for the year 2009.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake because maybe in another year, the girls doubles is anneke... Let me check all rows:\n\n- Row 6 (2007): girls doubles: \"anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati\"\n- Row 8 (2009): girls doubles: \"ayu pratiwi anggi widia\"\n\nSo the claim's first part is about 2009, but the correct entry for anneke... is in 2007. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm supposed to check if both parts are true for the same year. So, maybe in some other year, both conditions meet? Let me see:\n\nLooking through each row, for each year, check girls doubles and mixed doubles.\n\nRow 6 (2007):\n- girls doubles: anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati\n- mixed doubles: wifqi windarto debby susanto\n\nYes! In row 6, the \"girls doubles\" is as per the claim, and the \"mixed doubles\" is exactly what the claim says. But wait, that's for 2007, not 2009.\n\nSo the claim incorrectly states that both are in 2009, but actually they're in 2007.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because in 2009, neither of these entries match. However, wait a second: let me recheck row 8's mixed doubles. The claim says \"wifqi windarto debby susanto\" for 2009, but in row 8, it's different.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- For 2009 (row index 8), check girls doubles and mixed doubles.\n- Additionally, since the correct entries are in row 6, perhaps we should include those as well? Or just focus on 2009?\n\nWait, according to the problem statement, the claim is about 2009. So regardless of where else these names appear, if they don't match for 2009, then the claim is false.\n\nSo in row 8 (2009), \"girls doubles\" is different and mixed doubles are also different. Therefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect for that year.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm supposed to find any occurrence where these two names appear together, regardless of the year? But no, the claim specifically mentions 2009.\n\nThus, in row 8 (2009), neither \"girls doubles\" nor \"mixed doubles\" match what's claimed. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\nBut let me confirm once more to avoid mistakes:\n\nRow index 8: 2009\n- girls doubles: ayu pratiwi anggi widia\n- mixed doubles: didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu\n\nThe claim says girls doubles should be anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati and mixed doubles as wifqi windarto debby susanto. Neither matches, so the answer is FALSE.\n\nHowever, the initial thought was that in row 6 (2007), both parts are correct. So maybe the user made a mistake in stating the year as 2009 instead of 2007. But since we're evaluating based on the claim's statement, which specifies 2009, the answer is FALSE.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells to check are:\n\n- For girls doubles in 2009: row index 8, column \"girls doubles\"\n- For mixed doubles in 2009: row index 8, column \"mixed doubles\"\n\nThese two entries don't match the claim, confirming it's FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is evaluated as FALSE because both the girls doubles and mixed doubles entries for 2009 do not match the specified names. The relevant cells are in row 8 (year 2009) for both columns.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"girls doubles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
