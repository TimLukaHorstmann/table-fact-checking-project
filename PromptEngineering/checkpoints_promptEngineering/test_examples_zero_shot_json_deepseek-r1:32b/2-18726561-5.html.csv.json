    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I've got a table in JSON format with some data about football matches. The claim is: \"on 14 february 1976 the away team be manchester united and score 1  - 2 with home team leicester city\". My task is to determine if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information provided in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the table. The columns are \"tie no\", \"home team\", \"score\", \"away team\", and \"date\". Each row under \"data\" corresponds to a match with these details.\n\nThe claim mentions a specific date: 14 February 1976. So, I need to look through all the rows where the date is that day. Let's go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Tie no 1, home team Leicester City, score 1-2, away team Manchester United, date 14 Feb 1976.\nRow 1: Tie no 2, home team Bolton Wanderers, score 3-3, away team Newcastle United, same date.\nRow 2: Replay, home team Newcastle, score 0-0, away team Bolton, different date (18th).\nRow 3: Replay again, home team Bolton, score 1-2, away team Newcastle, 23rd Feb.\nRow 4: Tie no 3, Wolverhampton vs Charlton, same initial date.\nRow 5: Tie no 4, West Bromwich vs Southampton, same date.\nRow 6: Replay between Southampton and West Brom, different date.\nRow 7: Tie no 5, Derby vs Southend, same initial date.\nRow 8: Tie no 6, Norwich vs Bradford, 23rd Feb.\nRow 9: Tie no 7, Chelsea vs Crystal Palace, same initial date.\nRow 10: Tie no 8, Stoke vs Sunderland, same initial date.\nRow 11: Replay between Sunderland and Stoke, different date.\n\nSo, focusing on rows where the date is 14 Feb 1976: Rows 0, 1, 4,5,7,9,10.\n\nNow, let's check each of these for a match involving Manchester United as the away team against Leicester City at home with a score of 1-2.\n\nLooking at Row 0:\n- Home team: Leicester City\n- Away team: Manchester United\n- Score: 1 - 2\n- Date: 14 Feb 1976\n\nThis exactly matches all parts of the claim. So, this row supports the claim.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows with the same date that might contradict or provide additional info, but since Row 0 already fully supports the claim, and others don't involve Manchester United as away against Leicester City on that date, I can conclude based on this single relevant cell.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately reflects the data in row 0 of the table. The home team was Leicester City, the away team Manchester United, with a score of 1-2 on 14 February 1976.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the claim and the table step by step. The claim is: \"all game take place 14 february 1976 or after or 23 february 1976 or before and there be never a tie higher than 8 or below 1.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse the date condition. It says that all games are either on or after February 14, 1976, or on or before February 23, 1976. So any game must fall within these two periods. Let's look at each row in the table:\n\n- Rows 0: 14 Feb 1976 \u2192 fits.\n- Row 1: 14 Feb 1976 \u2192 fits.\n- Row 2: 18 Feb 1976 \u2192 between 14 and 23, so fits.\n- Row 3: 23 Feb 1976 \u2192 exactly the end date.\n- Rows 4-5-7-8: All on 14 Feb 1976.\n- Row 6: 17 Feb 1976 \u2192 within range.\n- Row 9: 23 Feb 1976 \u2192 fits.\n- Row 10: 14 Feb 1976 \u2192 yes.\n- Row 11: 17 Feb 1976 \u2192 also fits.\n\nSo, all dates are within the specified ranges. Next, checking the tie numbers: \"never a tie higher than 8 or below 1.\" The tie no column shows:\n\n- Rows 0-1-4-5-7-8-10 have tie numbers 1 through 8.\n- Rows 2-3-6-11 have \"replay\" instead of a number.\n\nSince the claim refers to \"tie higher than 8 or below 1,\" but all numerical ties are between 1 and 8. The replays don't affect this condition because they aren't numbers beyond that range. Therefore, the tie condition is satisfied.\n\nAll conditions in the claim hold true based on the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me parse it again. It looks like there are two separate conditions here:\n\n1. The away team is Southend United when the score is 1-0.\n2. The home team is Chelsea when the score is 2-3.\n\nSo I need to check both of these statements in the table and see if they hold true.\n\nFirst, let me look for a row where the away team is Southend United and the score is 1-0. \n\nLooking through the data:\n- Row 4: Home team is Derby County, away team is Southend United, score is 1-0. Wait, but in this case, Southend United is the away team, right? Let me check the columns. The columns are \"tie no\", \"home team\", \"score\", \"away team\", \"date\". So yes, row 4 has away team as Southend United and score 1-0. That seems to satisfy the first condition.\n\nNow for the second part: home team is Chelsea with a score of 2-3. \n\nLooking through the rows:\n- Row 6: Home team is Chelsea, away team is Crystal Palace, score is 2-3. So that matches exactly. The home team is Chelsea and the score is 2-3.\n\nSo both conditions are satisfied in the table. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other row where Southend United is away with a 1-0 score? Only row 4. And for Chelsea as home team with 2-3, only row 6. So yes, both conditions are met in the table.\n\nSo my conclusion is that the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim has two parts: \n1.

The claim says: \"on 18 february 1976 the away team be leicester city and score 3 - 0 with home team manchester unite.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into its components to check each part against the table.\n\nThe date mentioned is 18 February 1976. I'll look through the \"date\" column in the table data to find any rows that match this date. Scanning through, I see a few dates: most are on 14th or 23rd, but there's one on 18 February 1976 at row index 2.\n\nLooking at row 2:\n- Tie no: \"replay\"\n- Home team: \"newcastle united\"\n- Score: \"0 - 0\"\n- Away team: \"bolton wanderers\"\n- Date: \"18 february 1976\"\n\nSo the date matches. Now, checking the teams and score in this row.\n\nThe claim states that the away team is leicester city and the home team is manchester united with a score of 3-0. But according to row 2, the away team is bolton wanderers, not leicester city. The home team is newcastle united, and the score was 0-0.\n\nLooking further down the table for other entries on February 18th: I only see that one entry at row index 2. There's no other match on this date with different teams or a different score.\n\nAdditionally, checking other rows to ensure there isn't another game on 18 February. The next possible rows are 3 and 7, but they're on 23rd and 17th respectively. So the only relevant row is index 2.\n\nComparing each part:\n- Date: Correct (row 2)\n- Away team: Claim says leicester city, table says bolton wanderers \u2192 discrepancy\n- Home team: Claim says manchester united, table says newcastle united \u2192 discrepancy\n- Score: Claim says 3-0, table says 0-0 \u2192 discrepancy\n\nAll parts of the claim don't match the data in row 2. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells are:\n- Row 2, \"date\"\n- Row 2, \"home team\"\n- Row 2, \"score\"\n- Row 2, \"away team\"\n\nThese show that none of the details in the claim align with what's in the table for February 18th.

Or maybe it's about the score being a tie, but looking at the data, some games have equal scores like \"3-3\", which would be a draw or tie.\n\nBut let me re-examine the claim: \"all game take place on 17 february 1976 or before 14 february 1976 or after and every game be a tie between 7 and 1.\" So, perhaps it's saying that all games are either on 17 Feb, before 14 Feb, or after (but the 'after' part is unclear). Additionally, every game has a tie score between 7 and 1. Wait, that doesn't make sense because scores like \"3-0\" can't be between 7 and 1.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me look at the data in the table to see what's there.\n\nLooking at the 'date' column:\n\n- Rows 0: 14 Feb 1976\n- Row 1: 14 Feb 1976\n- Row 2: 18 Feb 1976 (a replay)\n- Row 3: 23 Feb 1976 (another replay)\n- Rows 4,5,7: all on 14 Feb 1976\n- Row 6: 17 Feb 1976 (replay)\n- Row 8: 23 Feb 1976\n- Row 9: 23 Feb 1976\n- Rows 10,11: 14 Feb and 17 Feb respectively.\n\nSo the dates are either 14, 17, 18, or 23 Feb 1976. The claim says all games take place on 17 Feb or before 14 Feb or after... but 'after' is unclear. Wait, perhaps it's a typo and meant to say \"all game[s] take place on 17 February 1976 or before 14 February 1976 or after [some date]\", but the claim isn't specific about the 'after' part.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is that all games are either on 17 Feb, or before 14 Feb, or after (but without a specified end). Alternatively, maybe it's trying to say that all games are on 17 Feb, before 14 Feb, or after some unspecified date. But looking at the data, some games are on dates after 17 Feb (like 23rd), which would be 'after' if considering 17 as a cutoff.\n\nBut perhaps I should focus on whether all games are either on 17 Feb, before 14 Feb, or after. Wait, that seems too broad because any date could fit into one of those categories unless it's between 14 and 17. But looking at the dates in the table:\n\n- Rows with dates: 14,14,18,23,14,14,... So there are games on 14,17,18,23.\n\nSo for the date condition, any game on or before 14 Feb (which is row 0,1, etc.) or on 17 Feb (row6) would satisfy. The other games (on 18 and 23) are after 17 Feb. So if the claim says all games are either on 17, before 14, or after... but what's 'after'? Maybe it's a way of saying any date is allowed because they're covered in one category or another. But that doesn't seem to make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is misphrased and meant to say that all games are either on 17 Feb or before 14 Feb (so dates <=14 Feb). If that's the case, then looking at the data:\n\n- Rows with date 18 Feb: would violate because they're after 17. So rows2,3, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is that all games are on 17 Feb or before 14 Feb (so up to 14), but in the table, some games are on later dates like 18 and 23, which would contradict that.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the claim: \"all game take place on 17 february 1976 or before 14 february 1976 or after and every game be a tie between 7 and 1.\" The 'after' part is incomplete, so perhaps it's a mistake. Maybe the intended meaning was that all games are either on 17 Feb or before 14 Feb (so dates up to 14), but then in the data, there are games later than that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to all games being on those specific dates, and not any others.\n\nNow, regarding the second part: \"every game be a tie between 7 and 1.\" That seems unclear. Perhaps it means every game is a tie (i.e., has equal scores), and the score is between 7-1 or something? Wait, that doesn't make sense because a tie would have equal scores like 3-3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is saying that all games are ties with scores between 7-1, but looking at the data:\n\n- Row0: 2-2 (tie)\n- Row1: 3-3 (tie)\n- Row2: 4-4 (tie)\n- Row3: 5-5 (tie)\n- Row4: 3-0 (not a tie)\n- Row5: 2-0 (not a tie)\n- Row6: 3-3 (tie)\n- Row7: 1-0 (not a tie)\n- Row8: 2-2 (tie)\n- Row9: 3-0 (not a tie)\n- Row10: 3-3 (tie)\n- Row11: 2-2 (tie)\n\nSo not all games are ties. Only some rows have equal scores, while others don't.\n\nAdditionally, the \"tie between 7 and 1\" part is unclear. Maybe it's a typo and should be \"a tie with a score between 0-7\", but that still doesn't fit with what we're seeing.\n\nSo perhaps the claim has two parts:\n\n1. All games are either on 17 Feb 1976, or before 14 Feb 1976, or after (but 'after' is undefined).\n2. Every game is a tie between scores of 0 and 7.\n\nBut looking at the data:\n\n- For part 1: Some games are on dates after 17 Feb (like 23rd), which would be 'after', but if the claim allows that, then it's okay.\n- Part 2: Not all games are ties; some have scores where one team won.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is that every game has a tie score between 0 and 7. But looking at the data:\n\n- Row4: 3-0 (not a tie)\n- Row5: 2-0\n- Row7:1-0\n- Row9:3-0\n\nSo these are not ties, which contradicts part of the claim.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe \"tie\" in the claim refers to the 'tie no' column, meaning whether it's a replay or not. In that case:\n\nLooking at the 'tie no' column:\n\n- Rows with 'tie no' as 0 are replays (rows2,3,6, etc.), but I'm not sure if that's relevant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"tie between 7 and 1\" is a typo for something else, like scores between 0 and 7 or specific point ranges.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps it's better to check which parts of the claim are true based on the data:\n\n- Are all games either on 17 Feb, before 14 Feb, or after? Well, yes, because any date can be categorized as such. But if the intended meaning was that no games are between 15 and 16 Feb, but in reality, there are games on later dates.\n\nWait, looking at the data:\n\n- Date column shows various dates, including 2023-07-18 (July 18) and 2023-07-23. So if the claim is that all games took place either on July 17 or before July 14, then that's not true because there are games after July 14.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dates in the data are irrelevant, and the 'tie between 7 and 1' refers to something else. But I'm not sure.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the data provided:\n\n- Not all games are ties (equal scores).\n- Some games occur after July 17, so if the claim is that all games are on or before July 14 or on July 17, then it's false because there are games on later dates.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not entirely accurate based on the data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states two main points: that all games occur on July 17, before July 14, or after (though \"after\" is undefined), and that every game is a tie with scores between 0 and 7. \n\nBased on the data:\n\n1. **Date Check**: The data includes games played on dates such as July 18 and 23, which are after July 17. Therefore, not all games are confined to July 14 or earlier or exactly on July 17.\n\n2. **Tie Check**: Not every game is a tie. Several games have unequal scores (e.g., 3-0, 2-0), indicating that one team won rather than it being a draw.\n\n**Conclusion**: The claim is not entirely accurate as the data shows games occurring after July 17 and not all games are ties. \n\nAnswer: The claim is false because there are games played after July 17 and not every game resulted in a tie.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"chelsea be the away team when sunderland be the home team and stroke city be the home team when southampton be the away team.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the two parts of the claim:\n\n1. Chelsea is the away team when Sunderland is the home team.\n2. Stoke City is the home team when Southampton is the away team.\n\nI'll go through each part step by step using the data from the table.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"Chelsea be the away team when sunderland be the home team.\" So, I'm looking for a row where Sunderland is the home team and see if Chelsea is listed as the away team.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 10:\n- Home Team: Stoke City\n- Away Team: Sunderland\n\nWait, that's not right. Wait, let me check all rows where Sunderland is the home team. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Leicester vs Man U - no.\nRow 1: Bolton vs Newcastle - no.\nRow 2: Newcastle replay at Bolton - no.\nRow 3: Bolton replay at Newcastle - no.\nRow 4: Wolves vs Charlton - no.\nRow 5: West Brom vs Southampton - no.\nRow 6: Southampton vs West Brom in a replay - but here, Southampton is home. So that's the other way around.\nRow 7: Derby vs Southend - no.\nRow 8: Norwich vs Bradford - no.\nRow 9: Chelsea vs Crystal Palace - Chelsea is away, but who is home? Crystal Palace. But we're looking for Sunderland as home team.\n\nWait, I see row 10 and 11:\n\nRow 10:\n- Home Team: Stoke City\n- Away Team: Sunderland\n\nSo in this case, Stoke City is home, and Sunderland is away.\n\nRow 11:\n- It's a replay between Sunderland and Stoke. In the data, it says \"replay\", with Sunderland as home team (since it's the row where \"home team\" is Sunderland) because in row 10, Stoke was home against Sunderland. So the replay would be at Sunderland.\n\nWait, no: looking at row 11:\n\nRow 11:\n- Home Team: Sunderland\n- Away Team: Stoke City\n\nSo this is a replay of row 10. In row 10, Stoke was home and Sunderland away; in row 11, they switch. So in row 11, Sunderland is the home team.\n\nNow, in that row, who's playing? Home team is Sunderland, away team is Stoke City. There's no Chelsea here. So in this case, when Sunderland is home (row 11), the away team is Stoke City, not Chelsea. Therefore, the first part of the claim is false because when Sunderland is home, Chelsea isn't the away team.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed another row where Sunderland is home and Chelsea is away. Let me check all rows again:\n\nLooking at each row's \"home team\" column:\n\nRow 0: Leicester\nRow 1: Bolton\nRow 2: Newcastle (replay)\nRow 3: Bolton (replay)\nRow 4: Wolverhampton\nRow 5: West Brom\nRow 6: Southampton\nRow 7: Derby\nRow 8: Norwich\nRow 9: Chelsea? Wait, row 9's home team is Norwich, away is Bradford. Row 10: Stoke home, Sunderland away. Row 11: Sunderland home, Stoke away.\n\nSo in all the rows where Sunderland is the home team (only row 11), the away team is Stoke City, not Chelsea. So the first part of the claim is false.\n\nNow checking the second part: \"Stoke City be the home team when Southampton be the away team.\"\n\nLooking for rows where Southampton is the away team and see if Stoke is home.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nRow 5: Home team West Brom, away Southampton. But in this case, who's home? West Brom. So when Southampton is away (row 5), the home team is West Brom, not Stoke.\n\nAlso, row 6 is a replay where Southampton is home against West Brom, so that doesn't fit. Any other rows?\n\nLooking through all data:\n\nRow 0: Leicester vs Man U - no.\nRow 1: Bolton vs Newcastle - no.\nRow 2: Newcastle vs Bolton (replay) - no.\nRow 3: Bolton vs Newcastle (replay) - no.\nRow 4: Wolves vs Charlton - no.\nRow 5: West Brom vs Southampton. Here, West Brom is home, Southampton away.\nRow 6: Southampton vs West Brom (replay). Now, here, Southampton is home.\nRow 7: Derby vs Southend - no.\nRow 8: Norwich vs Bradford - no.\nRow 9: Chelsea vs Crystal Palace - no.\nRow 10: Stoke vs Sunderland. Here, Stoke is home, and the away team is Sunderland. So in this case, when is Southampton away?\n\nOnly row 5 has Southampton as away, and in that case, the home team was West Brom, not Stoke. There's another row where Southampton is away? Let me check again.\n\nNo, only row 5 has Southampton as away team. In all other rows, either they are home or not involved. So when Southampton is the away team (row 5), the home team is West Brom, not Stoke. Therefore, the second part of the claim is also false because when Southampton is away, Stoke isn't home; instead, West Brom is.\n\nWait, but row 10 has Stoke as home against Sunderland, which is different from Southampton. So there's no row where when Southampton is away, Stoke is home. Hence, both parts of the claim are false.\n\nSo in summary:\n\n- When Sunderland is home (row 11), away team is Stoke, not Chelsea.\n- When Southampton is away (row 5), home team is West Brom, not Stoke.\n\nTherefore, the claim is entirely incorrect based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided table, both statements in the claim are false:\n\n1. **Chelsea is not the away team when Sunderland is the home team**: In row 11, Sunderland is the home team, and the away team is Stoke City, not Chelsea.\n\n2. **Stoke City is not the home team when Southampton is the away team**: In row 5, Southampton is the away team, and the home team is West Brom, not Stoke City.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect according to the data.\n\n**Answer:** Both statements in the claim are false based on the provided data.",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format. Let me first understand the structure of the table.\n\nThe table has columns: \"tie no\", \"home team\", \"score\", \"away team\", and \"date\". The data consists of multiple rows, each representing a match with these details.\n\nNow, let's break down the claim: \"the away team be manchester united when the score be 0 - 0 and the home team be norwich city when the score be 2 - 1\".\n\nHmm, I think this is two separate conditions connected by 'and', meaning both need to be true for the entire claim to be TRUE.\n\nFirst condition: \"away team\" is Manchester United when the \"score\" is 0-0.\nSecond condition: \"home team\" is Norwich City when the score is 2-1.\n\nWait, actually, I should parse it carefully. It might mean that both conditions must hold true simultaneously? Or are they two separate claims connected by 'and'? The wording is a bit unclear. Let me read it again.\n\nThe claim says: \"the away team be manchester united when the score be 0 - 0 and the home team be norwich city when the score be 2 - 1\"\n\nSo, I think it's two separate statements connected by 'and'. So both need to be true for the overall claim to be TRUE. Let me check each condition separately.\n\nFirst condition: Is there a row where \"away team\" is Manchester United and \"score\" is 0-0?\n\nLooking through the data:\n\nRow 0: away team is Manchester United, score is 1-2. Not 0-0.\nRow 1: away team is Newcastle United, score 3-3.\nRow 2: tie no is 'replay', home team is Newcastle, away is Bolton, score 0-0. So here, the away team is Bolton, not Manchester United. So this doesn't match.\nOther rows with 'replay' may have different teams.\n\nSo in row 2, the away team is Bolton Wanderers when the score is 0-0. There's no row where the away team is Manchester United and the score is 0-0.\n\nWait, let me check all the rows again:\n\nRow 0: Away team is Man Utd, score 1-2.\nRow 2: replay, home Newcastle, away Bolton, score 0-0.\nRow3: replay, home Bolton, away Newcastle, score 1-2.\n\nSo in row2, the away team is Bolton, not Man Utd. So first condition fails.\n\nSecond condition: \"home team\" is Norwich City when the score is 2-1.\n\nLooking for rows where home team is Norwich City and score is 2-1.\n\nChecking each row:\n\nRow5: tie no4, home team Norwich City? Wait, let's see. Row indices are from 0 to 11.\n\nWait, let me list all the rows with their data:\n\nIndex 0:\ntie no 1\nhome leicester city\nscore 1-2\naway manchester united\ndate 14 feb 76\n\nIndex1:\ntie no2\nhome bolton\nscore3-3\naway newcastle\ndate same.\n\nIndex2: replay, home newcastle, away Bolton, score0-0.\n\nIndex3: replay, home Bolton, away newcastle, score1-2.\n\nIndex4: tie no3, home Wolverhampton, score3-0, away Charlton.\n\nIndex5: tie no4, home West Brom, score1-1, away Southampton.\n\nIndex6: replay, home Southampton, away west brom, score4-0.\n\nIndex7: tie no5, home Derby, score1-0, away southend.\n\nIndex8: tie no6, home norwich city, score1-2, away bradford.\n\nIndex9: tie no7, home chelsea, score2-3, away crystal palace.\n\nIndex10: tie no8, home stoke, score0-0, away sunderland.\n\nIndex11: replay, home sunderland, away stoke, score2-1.\n\nSo looking for \"home team\" being Norwich City. That's in row index8 (tie no6). The score is 1-2, so the away team won. So here, home is Norwich, but the score is not 2-1. It's 1-2.\n\nIs there another row where home team is Norwich? Let me check all rows:\n\nOnly row8 has \"home team\" as Norwich City. The score is 1-2, so it doesn't match 2-1.\n\nSo the second condition also fails because in the only row where home team is Norwich City, the score isn't 2-1.\n\nTherefore, both conditions are not met, making the claim FALSE.\n\nNow, compiling relevant cells:\n\nFor first condition: looking for away team Manchester United and score 0-0. Found no such rows. The closest was row0, but score was 1-2.\n\nSo in this case, perhaps I can note that there's no row where away team is Man Utd with 0-0. So relevant cells would be the ones where these could potentially match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to look for all rows where the score is 0-0 and see what the away teams are, but in this case, row2 has score 0-0 with away team Bolton, not Man Utd.\n\nFor second condition: looking for home team Norwich City. Only found in row8, which has score1-2.\n\nSo relevant cells would be:\n\nFrom first condition:\nRow2: away team is Bolton Wanderers (cell value), score0-0.\n\nSecond condition:\nRow8: home team Norwich City, score1-2.\n\nThus, these are the rows that could potentially satisfy each condition, but they don't match what's needed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim has two parts:\n\n1. The away team being Manchester United when the score is 0-0.\n2. The home team being Norwich City when the score is 2-1.\n\nUpon reviewing the data:\n- No row has Manchester United as the away team with a 0-0 score.\n- The only row with Norwich City as the home team (row8) has a score of 1-2, not 2-1.\n\nTherefore, both conditions are unmet.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{\\text{FALSE}}",
