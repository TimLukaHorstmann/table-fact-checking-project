    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"there be 3 entrant with the ferrari 038 305 v12 engine\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided data table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. The key points are:\n- There are exactly 3 entrants.\n- Each of these entrants uses the Ferrari 038 305 V12 engine.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents an entrant with details about their team name, constructor/engine, chassis, engine specs, and driver(s).\n\nI'll focus on the \"constructor/engine\" column to find entries that mention Ferrari. The exact engine model mentioned in the claim is Ferrari 038 305 V12. I need to check if this exact string appears.\n\nGoing through each row:\n- Row 19: Scuderia Ferrari uses Ferrari 038 3.5 V12. Close, but not exactly \"305 V12\".\n- Other rows either don't mention Ferrari or have different engine specifications.\n\nSo, only one entrant (Scuderia Ferrari) has an engine close to what's claimed, but the exact model doesn't match. Therefore, there aren't three entrants with that specific engine.\n\nI'll collect the relevant cells from Scuderia Ferrari to show it's the only one. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there are 3 entrants using the Ferrari 038 305 V12 engine. Looking through the table:\n\n- **Row 19**: \"constructor/engine\" column shows \"ferrari\" with engine \"ferrari 038 3.5 v12\". The engine is close but not exactly \"305 V12\".\n- No other rows mention Ferrari or have the exact engine model.\n\nThus, only one entrant has a Ferrari engine similar to the claim, so the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"constructor/engine\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"constructor/engine\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"constructor/engine\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
