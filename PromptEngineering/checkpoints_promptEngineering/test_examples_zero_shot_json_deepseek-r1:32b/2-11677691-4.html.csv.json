Did Kevin McReynolds attend UCLA for college?\n2. Is his hometown Washington, DC?\n\nLooking at the JSON table, let's find the row where \"player\" is \"kevin mcreynolds\".

There are 12 rows of data corresponding to different players.\n\nThe claim is about Trey Depriest playing as a linebacker. So, I need to check if there's a player named Trey Depriest in the table and what his position is listed as.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: Connor McGovern \u2013 defensive line\nRow 1: Kevin McReynolds \u2013 defensive line\nRow 2: Jesse Hayes \u2013 defensive line\nRow 3: Kris Harley \u2013 defensive line\nRow 4: Trey Depriest \u2013 linebacker\nRow 5: Lawrence Thomas \u2013 linebacker\nRow 6: Tre Madden \u2013 linebacker\nRow 7: Derek Watt \u2013 linebacker\nRow 8: Brandon Mullins \u2013 linebacker\nRow 9: Karlos Williams \u2013 defensive back\nRow 10: Doran Grant \u2013 defensive back\nRow 11: Jabriel Washington \u2013 defensive back\n\nSo, in row 4, the player is Trey Depriest and his position is listed as \"linebacker\". That directly supports the claim.\n\nNow, considering the instructions, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant columns here would be \"player\" and \"position\". For Trey Depriest's row (row index 4), both of these columns are important because they confirm his name and position.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Trey Depriest is listed as a linebacker in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

My task is to find the row where the player's name is Brandon Mullins and check his hometown.\n\nLooking through the data, each row starts with a player's name. I'll scan down until I find \"brandon mullins\". Scanning the first elements: Connor McGovern, Kevin McReynolds, Jesse Hayes, Kris Harley, Trey DePriest, Lawrence Thomas, Tre Madden, Derek Watt, Brandon Mullins... okay, there it is at row index 8.\n\nNow, in that row, I need to check the \"hometown\" column. The columns are ordered as player (0), position (1), school (2), hometown (3), college (4). So for row 8, the hometown should be at index 3 of that array.\n\nLooking at row 8: Brandon Mullins's data is [ \"brandon mullins\", \"linebacker\", \"coppell high school\", \"coppell , texas\", \"syracuse  (lacrosse )\"]. So yes, the hometown is listed as \"coppell , texas\".\n\nThe claim says \"hometown be coppell , texas\". Comparing it to the data: the claim matches exactly with what's in the table.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"connor mcgovern go to st john 's high school\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the table. It has five columns: player, position, school, hometown, and college. The data consists of 12 rows, each representing a different player with their respective details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"connor mcgovern\" and states that he went to \"st john 's high school.\" My goal is to verify if this information aligns with the data in the table.\n\nI'll begin by locating Connor McGovern in the table. Scanning through the first column, I find his entry at row index 0. Here are the details from that row:\n\n- player: connor mcgovern\n- position: defensive line\n- school: shanley high school\n- hometown: fargo, north dakota\n- college: missouri\n\nNext, I need to check which high school he attended. The relevant column here is \"school,\" so I'll look at the cell under this column for Connor McGovern. According to row 0, his school is listed as \"shanley high school.\"\n\nNow, comparing this with the claim that he went to \"st john 's high school,\" there's a discrepancy. Since \"shanley high school\" does not match \"st john 's high school,\" the claim appears to be incorrect.\n\nTo ensure I haven't overlooked anything, I'll cross-reference this information. Checking other rows just in case there's another player with a similar name or details could help prevent errors. However, looking through all 12 entries, I don't find any other Connor McGovern or any mention of St. John's High School except for Kevin Mcreynolds at row index 1, who attended that school.\n\nTherefore, based on the data provided in the table, the claim that Connor McGovern attended St. John's High School is FALSE.

The table says Washington, DC, which matches the claim. That seems correct so far.\n\nNext, looking at his college. The claim states he goes to Virginia Tech, but according to the table, his college is listed as UCLA. This is a discrepancy because Virginia Tech isn't mentioned here.\n\nSo, while part of the claim about his hometown is accurate, the part about his college is not. Since both parts need to be true for the entire claim to hold, and one of them doesn't match, the claim must be false.\n\nI should also note the relevant cells that were checked.

The table has columns: player, position, school, hometown, and college. Each row corresponds to a player with their respective details under these columns.\n\nThe claim is about Brandon Mullins' hometown. So my main focus should be on finding the row where the player's name is Brandon Mullins and then checking what his hometown is listed as in that row.\n\nLooking through the data array, I'll scan each row until I find \"brandon mullins\".
