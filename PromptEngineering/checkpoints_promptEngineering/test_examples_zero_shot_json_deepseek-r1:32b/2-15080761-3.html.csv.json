Third row: December 21, Intermediate Round 2nd Replay vs Small Heath.\n4. Fourth row: January 11, 1904, Intermediate Round 3rd Replay vs Small Heath.\n5.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the highest attendance of the manchester unite fc season be on 20 february , 1904\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the data array to find all occurrences related to Manchester United FC. However, upon reviewing the table, none of the \"opponents\" column entries mention \"manchester unite fc\". The opponents listed are \"small heath\", \"notts county\", and \"the wednesday\". This means that either the claim is incorrect about Manchester United being involved, or perhaps it's a typo and they meant another team.\n\nAssuming there might be a typo in the claim and focusing on the attendance figures regardless of the team (though ideally, we should check for Manchester United games), I'll examine the \"attendance\" column. The attendances listed are 10,000; 5,000; 3,000; 9,372; 12,000; 18,000; and 22,051.\n\nLooking at the attendance on \"20 february 1904\", which is in row index 6, the attendance was 22,051. Comparing this to all other attendances: 10k, 5k, 3k, 9.372k, 12k, and 18k. The highest among these is indeed 22,051.\n\nHowever, since the table doesn't show any games involving Manchester United FC (as \"manchester unite fc\" isn't listed in opponents), the claim might be incorrect regarding the team. But if we consider just the highest attendance regardless of team, then it's on 20 February 1904. \n\nBut wait, I should double-check: Is there a row where Manchester United is playing? The opponent \"small heath\" could possibly be referring to Manchester City, but that's speculative. Alternatively, perhaps \"manchester unite fc\" is the same as one of these opponents. However, in the data provided, none are named as such.\n\nTherefore, if the claim refers to a team not present in the table, it can't be verified. But since the instruction is to check against the table and the highest attendance is 22,051 on that date, perhaps the answer depends on whether Manchester United was actually involved in that game.\n\nGiven that the opponents are listed as \"the wednesday\" on 20 February, unless \"manchester unite fc\" refers to another team, which isn't clear here. So, if Manchester United FC is not present in any of the rows, then the claim might be about a different season or data not included.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made an error, and I should proceed based on the given data regardless of the team. In that case, the highest attendance was on 20 February 1904 with 22,051 attendees.\n\nSo, considering all this, if we're to verify based solely on the table without external knowledge about which games belong to Manchester United FC, then the claim's correctness isn't fully supported because the team isn't listed. But since attendance is a separate column and it is the highest on that date, perhaps the answer hinges on whether Manchester United had any game in this table.\n\nSince there are no rows where the opponent is Manchester United FC (assuming they were playing as either home or away), then the claim might be FALSE because the highest attendance was for another team's match. Alternatively, if \"the wednesday\" is an alias for Manchester United, but that seems unlikely without more context.\n\nIn conclusion, since the table doesn't have any games involving Manchester United FC (as per the opponents listed), and assuming the claim refers to their season, then the claim would be FALSE because there's no data supporting it. However, if we ignore the team aspect and just look at the highest attendance in the table regardless of which teams played, then the claim is TRUE for that date.\n\nBut given that the claim specifies \"manchester unite fc\", and they aren't present in the opponents, I think the correct answer should be FALSE because the data doesn't support the claim. Alternatively, perhaps Manchester United is playing at home or away under a different name, but without that information, it's safer to say it's FALSE.\n\nWait, looking again: The \"h / a\" column shows \"a\", \"a\", etc., which might indicate whether they're home or away. But if the team in question (Manchester United) isn't listed as an opponent, then their season's attendance wouldn't be reflected here. So, the table doesn't include any of Manchester United's games, so we can't determine their highest attendance from this data.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no information about Manchester United FC in the provided table.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"3 out of 4 game play against small health result in 1 - 1\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that there were four games played against a team called Small Heath, and out of these four games, three resulted in a 1-1 score.\n\nLooking at the table, I see seven rows, each representing a different match. The relevant columns here are \"date\", \"round\", \"opponents\", \"h / a\", \"result f - a\", and \"attendance\".\n\nI need to filter out all the games where the opponent is \"small heath\". Scanning through the data:\n\n1. Row 0: Opponents are Small Heath, result is 1-1.\n2. Row 1: Again, Small Heath as opponents, result 1-1.\n3. Row 2: Still against Small Heath, result remains 1-1.\n\nWait, that's three games so far, all with a 1-1 result. Now, I check if there are any more games against Small Heath in the table beyond row 2. Looking at rows 3 to 6:\n\nRow 3 is against Small Heath as well, but let me double-check: no, row 3's opponent is \"small heath\" again? Wait, no\u2014row 3 has \"opponents\" as \"small heath\"? Let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the data provided:\n\nRow indices are from 0 to 6.\n\n- Row 0: Small Heath\n- Row 1: Small Heath\n- Row 2: Small Heath\n- Row 3: Opponents is \"small heath\" (but perhaps it's a typo?

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"only the last 3 list game have attendance of over 10000\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the table contains. The columns are date, round, opponents, h/a (home or away), result f-a (full-time - away?), and attendance. There are seven rows of data from December 1903 to February 1904.\n\nThe claim is about the last three games having attendance over 10,000. So I need to check each game's attendance starting from the end of the table.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nRow 6 (the last row): Attendance is 22051. That's definitely above 10k.\nRow 5: Attendance is 18000, also over 10k.\nRow 4: Attendance is 12000, which is above 10k as well.\n\nSo the last three rows (rows 4, 5, 6) all have attendance over 10,000. Now, I need to check if any of the earlier games also had attendance over 10,000 because the claim says \"only\" the last three did. If there's a game before these three with attendance over 10k, then the claim would be false.\n\nLooking at row 3: Attendance is 9372. That's under 10k.\nRow 2: 3000, way below.\nRow 1: 5000, also under.\nRow 0: 10000 exactly. Wait, the claim specifies \"over\" 10,000, which would mean more than 10k. So 10000 is not over; it's equal. Therefore, row 0 doesn't count.\n\nSo all games before rows 4-6 have attendance below or exactly 10k. Thus, only the last three games meet the condition of having attendance over 10k. Hence, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The Wednesday appears only once as an opponent.\n2. This appearance happens during the last game of the FC season.\n\nI'll start by checking how many times \"the wednesday\" appears in the opponents column. Looking at the data:\n\n- Row 0: small heath\n- Row 1: small heath\n- Row 2: small heath\n- Row 3: small heath\n- Row 4: notts county\n- Row 5: notts county\n- Row 6: the wednesday\n\nSo, \"the wednesday\" appears only once in row 6. That satisfies the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, I need to confirm if this was the last game of the FC season. To determine that, I should look at the dates of all games and see which one is the latest. The dates are:\n\n- Row 0: 12 december 1903\n- Row 1: 16 december 1903\n- Row 2: 21 december 1903\n- Row 3: 11 january 1904\n- Row 4: 6 february 1904\n- Row 5: 10 february 1904\n- Row 6: 20 february 1904\n\nThe latest date is 20 February 1904, which corresponds to row 6.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: date, round, opponents, h/a, result f-a, and attendance. Each row represents a match with details about that particular game.\n\nThe claim mentions \"Manchester United FC,\" but in the table, the opponents listed are teams like Small Heath, Notts County, and The Wednesday. I don't see any mention of Manchester United as the home team (h) or away team (a). So, perhaps there's a typo, and it should be \"Manchester City\" or another team. However, based on the data given, we'll proceed with the assumption that the claim is about one of these matches.\n\nThe key point in the claim is identifying which date had the highest attendance. The table lists attendance numbers for each match:\n\n1. December 12, 1903: 10,000\n2. December 16, 1903: 5,000\n3. December 21, 1903: 3,000\n4. January 11, 1904: 9,372\n5. February 6, 1904: 12,000\n6. February 10, 1904: 18,000\n7. February 20, 1904: 22,051\n\nLooking at these numbers, the highest attendance is on February 20, 1904, with 22,051 attendees. The claim states that the highest was on February 10, 1904, which actually has an attendance of 18,000. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because a later match on February 20 had even higher attendance.\n\nTo support this, I'll extract the relevant rows and columns:\n\n- For February 10, 1904: Row index 5, column \"attendance\" has 18,000.\n- For February 20, 1904: Row index 6, column \"attendance\" has 22,051.\n\nSince the highest attendance isn't on February 10 but later, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the highest attendance was on February 10, 1904.

So four games in total.\n\nWait, let me count:\n\nRow indexes where opponents are \"small heath\":\nRows 0, 1, 2, and 3. That makes four games. \n\nNow the claim says that 2 out of these 4 resulted in a 1-1 draw. Let's check each result:\n- Row 0: 1 - 1 (draw)\n- Row 1: 1 - 1 (draw)\n- Row 2: 1 - 1 (another draw, so three draws here)\n- Row 3: 3 - 1 (a win for the home team)\n\nWait a minute, that's three games with 1-1 and one with 3-1. So actually, out of four games against small heath, three resulted in a 1-1 draw, not two.\n\nSo the claim states \"2 out of 4,\" but according to the table, it's three draws. Therefore, the claim is incorrect. It should be three out of four, not two. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to list the relevant cells that were checked. For each game against small heath, we need to check the result column. So for rows 0,1,2,3 in the 'result f - a' column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because three out of four games against Small Heath ended in a draw, not two.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result f  - a\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result f  - a\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result f  - a\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result f  - a\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"only the last 2 list game have an attendance of more than 10000\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. The columns are: date, round, opponents, h / a, result f - a, and attendance. Each row represents a game with details in these categories.\n\nThe claim states that only the last two games have attendances over 10,000. To verify this, I'll check each row's attendance value.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Row 0: Attendance is 10,000. This is exactly 10k, not more.\n- Row 1: Attendance is 5,000. Less than 10k.\n- Row 2: Attendance is 3,000. Also less.\n- Row 3: Attendance is 9,372. Still under 10k.\n- Row 4: Attendance is 12,000. This exceeds 10k.\n- Row 5: Attendance is 18,000. Also over 10k.\n- Row 6: Attendance is 22,051. That's more than 10k as well.\n\nWait a minute. The claim says only the last two games have attendances over 10k, but according to this, row 4 (which is the fifth game) has an attendance of 12,000, which is above 10k. That means there are three games with attendances over 10k: rows 4,5,6.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't accurate because more than just the last two games meet that condition.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because not only the last two but also the third-to-last game has attendance exceeding 10,000. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the wednesday only appear as an opponent 1 time , during the first game of the fc season",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the wednesday only appear as an opponent 1 time , during the first game of the fc season.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check how many times 'the wednesday' appears in the opponents column. Looking at the data:\n\n- Row 0: small heath\n- Row 1: small heath\n- Row 2: small heath\n- Row 3: small heath\n- Row 4: notts county\n- Row 5: notts county\n- Row 6: the wednesday\n\nSo, 'the wednesday' appears only once in row 6. That part of the claim seems correct\u2014only one appearance.\n\nNext, the claim states that this was during the first game of the FC season. To verify this, I need to look at the dates and see if row 6 is indeed the earliest date.\n\nLooking at the dates:\n\n- Row 0: 12 december 1903\n- Row 1: 16 december 1903\n- Row 2: 21 december 1903\n- Row 3: 11 january 1904 (This is after December, so later in the year)\n- Row 4: 6 february 1904\n- Row 5: 10 february 1904\n- Row 6: 20 february 1904\n\nWait a second. The first date is December 12, which is earlier than February. So the earliest game is in row 0 on December 12, but the opponent there was 'small heath', not 'the wednesday'. Therefore, 'the wednesday' appeared much later in the season.\n\nSo the claim that they only appear once is true, but the part about it being during the first game of the season is false because their match was on February 20, which isn't the earliest date. The first games were in December against small heath and notts county in February.\n\nTherefore, the overall claim is FALSE because while 'the wednesday' appears once, they weren't the opponent in the first game of the season.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"the wednesday\" appeared only once as an opponent during the first game of the season. From the table, 'the wednesday' is listed once (row 6), but it's not the earliest date. The first games were in December against small heath and notts county, with 'the wednesday' appearing much later.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
