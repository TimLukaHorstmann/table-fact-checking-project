    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"2 of the 5 films be directed by j\u0101nis nords\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the table structure. The columns are: year (ceremony), film title used in nomination, original title, director, and result. There are 5 rows of data corresponding to different films and their details.\n\nThe claim is about two specific points:\n1. There should be exactly 2 films out of the 5.\n2. Both of these films should have been directed by \"j\u0101nis nords\".\n\nWait, I notice a typo in the claim: it says \"be direct\" instead of \"were directed\". I'll assume that's a mistake and proceed accordingly.\n\nLooking at the director column for each row:\n\n- Row 0: Director is \"j\u0101nis strei\u0146s\"\n- Row 1: Director is \"aigars grauba\"\n- Row 2: Director is \"m\u0101ris martinsons\"\n- Row 3: Director is \"yevgeni pashkevich\"\n- Row 4: Director is \"j\u0101nis nords\"\n\nSo, only one film (row 4) has a director named \"j\u0101nis nords\". The other rows do not list this director. Therefore, the claim that two films were directed by him is incorrect.\n\nI should also note the relevant cells to support this conclusion. For each row, I'll check the 'director' column to see if it matches \"j\u0101nis nords\".\n\nSo, the relevant cells are all the rows where the director's name could potentially be \"j\u0101nis nords\". That would be every row in the 'director' column.\n\nBut according to the data, only row 4 has this director. Therefore, the count is just one, which contradicts the claim of two films.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that only one film was directed by J\u0101nis Nords, so the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"director\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"director\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"director\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"director\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"director\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "none of the latvian submission be nominated for best foreign language film",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"none of the latvian submission be nominated for best foreign language film\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: year (ceremony), film title used in nomination, original title, director, and result. There are five rows of data.\n\nThe claim is about Latvian submissions not being nominated for Best Foreign Language Film. So, I need to check each row to see if any of these films were actually nominated.\n\nLooking at the \"result\" column in each row:\n1. 1992 (65th): Result is \"not nominated\"\n2. 2008 (81st): Also \"not nominated\"\n3. 2010 (83rd): Again, \"not nominated\"\n4. 2012 (85th): Same here, \"not nominated\"\n5. 2013 (86th): The result is \"tbd\", which I think stands for \"to be determined\" or maybe it hasn't been decided yet.\n\nSince all the entries except the last one have a result of \"not nominated,\" and the last one's status isn't clear, but assuming that if it were nominated, it would say so. The claim is about none being nominated, which seems to hold true because each has either \"not nominated\" or an undetermined status.\n\nWait, but does this table include all Latvian submissions? The problem says \"Latvian submission,\" so I should confirm that each film in the table is indeed from Latvia. Looking at the original titles and directors' names:\n\n- The first film's director is J\u0101nis Streids, which sounds Latvian.\n- Second: Aigars Grauba, also looks like a Latvian name.\n- Third: M\u0101ris Martinsons, another Latvian-sounding name.\n- Fourth: Yevgeni Pashkevich. Hmm, that surname doesn't sound Latvian; maybe he's from Belarus or somewhere else. But the film \"Gulf Stream Under the Iceberg\" might still be a Latvian submission if it was submitted by Latvia for the Oscars.\n\nThe fifth film's director is J\u0101nis Nords, definitely Latvian.\n\nSo, assuming all these films are Latvia's official submissions, and none have been nominated except possibly the last one which is TBD. But since the claim says \"none\" were nominated, I need to see if any of them got a nomination.\n\nLooking back at the results:\n- All are either \"not nominated\" or \"tbd.\" If \"tbd\" means it hasn't been decided yet, then perhaps it's still possible for that film to be nominated. However, in the context of this table, if the result is \"tbd,\" maybe it hasn't been released yet. Since the latest year here is 2013, and I know that as of now, Latvia has had some nominations but not necessarily in these specific years.\n\nWait, let me think again. The claim says none were nominated. If any of them resulted in a nomination, then the claim would be false. But according to this table, all have \"not nominated\" except one which is TBD. So if that last film wasn't actually nominated, then the claim holds. However, I can't be certain because \"tbd\" might mean it's still pending or perhaps it was later decided.\n\nBut given the information in the table, since none of them are marked as \"nominated,\" and only one is TBD, which might not have been finalized yet, the safest assumption based on the data provided is that none were nominated. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells: I need to point out each row's result column because that's where the nomination status is indicated. So rows 0-4 all have their \"result\" columns checked.\n</think>\n\nThe table lists Latvian film submissions and their results regarding Oscar nominations. Each submission from 1992 to 2013 (except one TBD) was not nominated, supporting the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"mother , i love you and gulf stream under the iceberg be submit 1 year after the other.\" Hmm, first, let's break down what this means.\n\nThe claim seems to say that two films were submitted one year apart. So I should check if these two movies were nominated in consecutive years.\n\nLooking at the table data, each row has details about a film, including the year and result. Let me find the rows for \"mother , i love you\" and \"gulf stream under the iceberg.\"\n\nFrom the data:\n- Row 4 (index starts at 0): \"mother , i love you\" with year \"2013 (86th)\"\n- Row 3: \"gulf stream under the iceberg\" with year \"2012 (85th)\"\n\nSo, \"mother , i love you\" was submitted in 2013 and \"gulf stream...\" in 2012. That's a one-year difference. But wait, is it 2012 and 2013 consecutive? Yes, they are one year apart.\n\nBut the claim says they were submitted \"1 year after the other.\" So if one was submitted in 2012 and the next in 2013, that's a gap of exactly one year. Therefore, the claim seems to be supported by the data.\n\nNow, checking the results: both entries have \"not nominated\" or \"tbd,\" but the claim is about submission timing, not the outcome. So those columns aren't directly relevant here.\n\nSo the relevant cells are the years for both films and their respective film titles to confirm which ones we're talking about. \n\nThus, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"defender of riga be submit more than a decade after the previous submission\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It seems like it's saying that the film \"Defenders of Riga\" was submitted (presumably for an award) more than ten years after another submission. I think the wording might be a bit off, but the intent is probably about the time gap between two submissions involving this film.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five entries. Each row has information about a year, film title used in nomination, original title, director, and result. The claim mentions \"Defenders of Riga,\" which I can see in the second row (index 1). Let me check the details here:\n\n- Year: 2008 (81st)\n- Film title: Defenders of Riga\n- Original title: R\u012bgas sargi\n- Director: Aigars Grauba\n- Result: Not nominated\n\nNow, to determine if this was submitted more than a decade after the previous submission, I need to see if there's another entry for this film or any related film that was submitted before 2008. Let me check the other rows.\n\nRow 0: The Child of Man (1992)\nRow 2: Hong Kong Confidential (2010)\nRow 3: Gulf Stream Under the Iceberg (2012)\nRow 4: Mother, I Love You (2013)\n\nLooking at these, none seem to be related to \"Defenders of Riga.\" Each film has a unique title and director. So, there's no other entry for \"Defenders of Riga\" or any indication that it was submitted more than once.\n\nSince the table only shows one submission for \"Defenders of Riga\" in 2008, I can't find any previous submission to compare it against. Without a prior submission date, I can't verify if there's a decade gap between two submissions.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by the data provided because there's only one entry for that film and no other related entries to establish a time difference.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is about whether \"Defenders of Riga\" was submitted more than ten years after another submission. However, the table only lists this film once in 2008 without any prior submissions.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"5 latvian film in 21 year be submit for the academy award best foreign language film\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It says there were five Latvian films submitted over a span of 21 years for the Academy Award in Best Foreign Language Film. The time frame isn't specified, but it's implied that these submissions occurred within some 21-year period.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a submission from Latvia to the Oscars. Let me check how many entries there are. There are five rows of data:\n\n1. 1992 (65th ceremony)\n2. 2008 (81st)\n3. 2010 (83rd)\n4. 2012 (85th)\n5. 2013 (86th)\n\nSo, there are five films listed from Latvia submitted between 1992 and 2013. Now, I need to check if these submissions cover a span of 21 years.\n\nCalculating the time between the first and last submission: 2013 - 1992 = 21 years. So the period from 1992 to 2013 is exactly 21 years, which fits the claim's timeframe.\n\nNext, I need to ensure that all five films are indeed Latvian. The table includes columns for \"film title used in nomination\" and \"original title,\" but there isn't a specific column stating the country of origin. However, given that all entries have directors with Latvian-sounding names (e.g., J\u0101nis Strei\u0137s, Aigars Grauba) and original titles in Latvian script, it's reasonable to infer that these are Latvian films.\n\nThe claim also mentions they were submitted for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The table's context is about submissions for this category since all entries list a result (either \"not nominated\" or \"tbd\"), which refers to their Oscar nomination status.\n\nTherefore, each of the five films was submitted by Latvia over 21 years, fitting the claim perfectly. \n\nTo map this against the relevant cells in the table:\n\n- Each row represents a film submission.\n- The \"year (ceremony)\" column shows the year and ceremony number, which helps determine the time span.\n- The \"film title used in nomination\" indicates each submission.\n\nSo, I'll list all five rows with their respective columns as relevant cells because each contributes to verifying the claim of five submissions over 21 years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"mother , i love you and defender of riga be submit 1 year after the other\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the two films mentioned in the claim: \"mother , i love you\" and \"defenders of riga\". From the table, I can see that each film has a \"year (ceremony)\" entry. \n\nFor \"mother , i love you\", the year listed is 2013 (86th). For \"defenders of riga\", it's 2008 (81st). Now, the claim suggests these two films were submitted one year apart from each other.\n\nLet me calculate the difference between their years. 2013 minus 2008 equals 5 years. So there's a five-year gap between when these two films were submitted. \n\nThe claim mentions they were submitted \"1 year after the other\", which would imply either one year apart, like 2009 and 2010, or perhaps consecutively in some way. But according to the table, they're five years apart. Therefore, this doesn't align with the claim.\n\nI should check if there's any possibility I'm misunderstanding the \"submit\" part. Maybe it refers to their submission for nomination? Looking at the \"result\" column, both are either not nominated or TBD. But that doesn't affect the timing of submission; they were still submitted in 2013 and 2008 respectively.\n\nSo the key point is the years: 2008 vs. 2013. That's five years apart, not one year after each other.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says: \"defender of riga be submit more than a decade before the next submission.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided in JSON format. There are five entries for films submitted over different years.\n\nLooking at each row:\n1. 1992 (65th): The film is \"the child of man.\" Not relevant because it's not \"defender of riga.\"\n2. 2008 (81st): The film is \"defenders of riga,\" directed by Aigars Grauba, and the result was \"not nominated.\"\n3. 2010 (83rd): Film is \"hong kong confidential.\" Not relevant.\n4. 2012 (85th): Film is \"gulf stream under the iceberg.\" Not relevant.\n5. 2013 (86th): Film is \"mother, i love you.\" Not relevant.\n\nThe claim is about \"defender of riga\" being submitted more than a decade before the next submission. From the table, I see that \"defenders of riga\" was submitted in 2008. The next submissions after 2008 are in 2010, 2012, and 2013.\n\nCalculating the time between 2008 and each subsequent submission:\n- 2010: 2 years later.\n- 2012: 4 years later.\n- 2013: 5 years later.\n\nNone of these are more than a decade (10 years) apart. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "5 latvian film in 11 year be submit for the academy award best foreign language film",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"5 latvian film in 11 year be submit for the academy award best foreign language film\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It states that five Latvian films were submitted over an 11-year period for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. I'll need to verify how many Latvian films are listed in the table and whether they span an 11-year timeframe.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a film submission. There are five rows total. The years given are 1992 (65th ceremony), 2008 (81st), 2010 (83rd), 2012 (85th), and 2013 (86th). \n\nTo check the timeframe, I'll calculate the difference between the earliest and latest years. The earliest year is 1992, and the latest is 2013. That's a span of 21 years (2013 - 1992 = 21), which is more than the claimed 11 years. \n\nNext, I need to confirm if all these films are Latvian. The table doesn't explicitly state the country of origin for each film, but given that some directors have Latvian names (e.g., J\u0101nis Strei\u0137s) and the original titles seem non-English, it's reasonable to assume they're from Latvia.\n\nHowever, since the timeframe is longer than 11 years, the claim about being submitted over an 11-year period isn't accurate. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_5\", \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony}\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
