    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"ken irvin be drag in the fourth round\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. The phrase seems a bit unclear. It says \"ken irvin be drag in the fourth round.\" Maybe it's a typo or misphrasing? Perhaps they meant to say that Ken Irvin was picked (or drafted) in the fourth round. That makes more sense in this context.\n\nLooking at the table, I see the columns: round, pick, player, position, school/club team. So each row represents a player and their draft details. The claim is about Ken Irvin's round, so I need to find his entry in the table.\n\nI'll scan through the data array looking for \"ken irvin.\" Let me check each row:\n\n- Row 0: ruben brown\n- Row 1: todd collins\n- Row 2: marlon kerner\n- Row 3: damien covington\n- Row 4: ken irvin\n\nYes, here it is in row 4. The columns are [round, pick, player, position, school]. So for Ken Irvin, the round is 4 and the pick number is 109.\n\nThe claim states that he was \"drag\" (probably meant drafted) in the fourth round. According to the table, his round is indeed 4. Therefore, the information supports the claim.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells for this verification. The key pieces of information are Ken Irvin's name and the round number. So the player column at row 4 and the round column at row 4 are relevant.\n\nPutting it all together: since the table confirms that Ken Irvin was picked in the fourth round, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Ken Irvin was drafted (probably meant) in the fourth round. The table shows that Ken Irvin is listed in the fourth round with a pick number of 109. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"in 1st round , ken irvin be draft\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the claim and cross-referencing it with the data provided.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It states that Ken Irvin was drafted in the first round. So, I need to check two main things: whether Ken Irvin is listed in the table and, if so, which round he was picked in.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row one by one. The columns are \"round\", \"pick\", \"player\", \"position\", and \"school / club team\". \n\nStarting from the top:\n- Row 0: Round 1, Pick 14, Ruben Brown.\n- Row 1: Round 2, Todd Collins.\n- Row 2: Round 3, Marlon Kerner.\n- Row 3: Round 3, Damien Covington.\n- Row 4: Round 4, Ken Irvin. \n\nWait a minute, here's Ken Irvin in row 4. The round for this entry is 4, not 1. So that immediately tells me something about the claim.\n\nThe claim says he was drafted in the first round, but according to the table, he was drafted in the fourth round. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states a different round than what's recorded here.\n\nNow, I need to make sure there are no other entries for Ken Irvin that might have him in an earlier round. Scanning through the rest of the rows:\n- Rows 5 and 6: Round 4, Justin Armour and Tony Cline.\n- Row 7: Round 5, John Holecek.\n- Row 8: Round 6, Shannon Clavelle.\n- Rows 9 and 10: Round 7, Tom N\u00e4ctten and Darick Holmes.\n\nThere's only one entry for Ken Irvin in row 4. So, no other possibilities here.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Ken Irvin was drafted in the fourth round, not the first. The relevant cells are the ones where we find his name and the corresponding round number.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE as Ken Irvin was drafted in the 4th round, not the 1st. \n\n{  \n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [  \n      {  \n         \"row_index\": 4,\n         \"column_name\": \"round\"\n      },\n      {  \n         \"row_index\": 4,\n         \"column_name\": \"player\"\n      }\n   ]\n}\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_ cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"in 4th round player from michigan select\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It seems to be saying that in the 4th round, a player from Michigan was selected. So, I need to look for any entry where the \"round\" is 4 and the \"school / club team\" is Michigan.\n\nLooking at the table's data:\n\nThe columns are: \"round\", \"pick\", \"player\", \"position\", \"school / club team\".\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: round=1, pick=14, player=Ruben Brown, position=guard, school=Pittsburgh.\n- Not the 4th round.\n\nRow 1: round=2, pick=45, player=Todd Collins, position=quarterback, school=Michigan.\n- This is from Michigan, but it's in the 2nd round, not the 4th. So doesn't fit the claim.\n\nRow 2: round=3, pick=76, Marlon Kerner, defensive back, Ohio State.\n- Not relevant.\n\nRow 3: round=3, pick=96, Damien Covington, linebacker, North Carolina State.\n- Round 3, so not relevant.\n\nRow 4: round=4, pick=109, Ken Irvin, defensive back, Memphis.\n- School is Memphis, not Michigan. So doesn't match.\n\nRow 5: round=4, pick=113, Justin Armour, wide receiver, Stanford.\n- School is Stanford. Not Michigan.\n\nRow 6: round=4, pick=131, Tony Cline, tight end, Stanford.\n- Again, Stanford. Not relevant.\n\nRows 7-10 are rounds 5 to 7, so beyond the 4th round. So no more checks needed there.\n\nSo in the 4th round, all players come from Memphis and Stanford. There's no player selected in the 4th round from Michigan. The only player from Michigan is Todd Collins, but he was picked in the 2nd round.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because while there's a player from Michigan, it wasn't selected in the 4th round. The relevant cells are where the school is Michigan and the rounds are checked.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
