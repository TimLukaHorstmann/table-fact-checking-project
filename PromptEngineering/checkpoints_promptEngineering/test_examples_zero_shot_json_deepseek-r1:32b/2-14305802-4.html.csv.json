    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the philadelphia flyer lose the 22nd game of the 1977-78 season to the los angeles king\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. The key elements are:\n1. The team in question is the Philadelphia Flyers.\n2. They lost their 22nd game.\n3. The opponent was the Los Angeles Kings.\n4. This happened during the 1977-78 season.\n\nLooking at the table, it has columns: game, december, opponent, score, record, points. So each row represents a game played in December of that season (since the 'december' column likely indicates the date in December).\n\nThe claim mentions the 22nd game, so I'll look for the row where \"game\" is 22. Scanning through the data, the first row has game=22. Let's check the details:\n\n- Opponent: \"los angeles kings\"\n- Score: \"4 - 2\"\n\nThe score shows the opponent (Los Angeles Kings) scored 4 and our team (Philadelphia Flyers) scored 2. So Philadelphia lost this game.\n\nBut wait, I need to confirm if the team in question is indeed the Philadelphia Flyers. The table's data doesn't explicitly mention the home team; it only lists the opponent. However, given that all rows list opponents like Los Angeles Kings, Colorado Rockies, etc., and considering the context of the 1977-78 season, I can infer that this table likely belongs to the Philadelphia Flyers' games.\n\nSo, in game number 22 against the Los Angeles Kings, the score was 4-2 in favor of LA. Therefore, the claim is correct: the Flyers lost this game to the Kings.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Philadelphia Flyers lost their 22nd game to the Los Angeles Kings during the 1977-78 season. The table shows that in game 22, the opponent was indeed the LA Kings with a score of 4-2, indicating a loss for the Flyers.\n\n**Answer: TRUE**\n\nRelevant cells include the row where game=22 and columns 'opponent' and 'score'.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim: \"the 1977 - 78 philadelphia flyer win the 24th and 25th game of the season against the new york ranger.\" \n\nFirst, checking the team names. The claim mentions the Philadelphia Flyers, but looking at the 'opponent' column in the table, I don't see any mention of the Philadelphia Flyers as an opponent. Instead, the opponents are teams like Los Angeles Kings, Colorado Rockies, New York Rangers, etc. So it seems the home team isn't listed here; we only have the opponents.\n\nNext, checking the game numbers 24 and 25. Let's look for rows where 'game' is 24 and 25. \n\nRow with game=24 (index 2): Opponent is New York Rangers. The score was 3-3, so it's a tie, not a win.\n\nRow with game=25 (index 3): Opponent is also New York Rangers. Score is 7-4, which means the home team won. So in this case, they did win against the New York Rangers.\n\nWait, but the claim says both games 24 and 25 were wins. From the table, game 24 was a tie, so that part isn't true. Therefore, the claim is not fully supported because only game 25 was a win, not both 24 and 25.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there's any mention of the Philadelphia Flyers in the data, but looking through all rows under 'opponent', they don't appear. So it seems the table doesn't include games against the Philadelphia Flyers at all. This makes the claim even more incorrect because the opponent wasn't them.\n\nSo putting it together: The team isn't listed as an opponent for any game in this table, and both games 24 and 25 weren't wins (only 25 was). Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the cleveland baron score no point against the 1977 - 78 philadelphia flyer on december 21st\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions Cleveland Baron (likely a typo for Cleveland Barons) scoring no points against the Philadelphia Flyers on December 21st of the 1977-78 season.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it contains data about games played in December, opponents, scores, records, and points. The relevant columns here are \"december\", \"opponent\", \"score\", and \"points\".\n\nI need to find the row where the opponent is Cleveland Barons and the date is December 21st. Scanning through the \"december\" column:\n\n- Row 4 (index 6): Opponent is Boston Bruins, date 15.\n- Row 8: Opponent is Montreal Canadiens, date 18.\n- Row 9 (index 8? Wait, let me recount correctly.\n\nWait, the data array starts at index 0. Let's list them properly:\n\nRow indices:\n0: December 1\n1: December 3\n2: December 7\n3: December 8\n4: December 10\n5: December 11 vs Cleveland Barons\n6: December 15\n7: December 17\n8: December 18\n9: December 21 (opponent Cleveland Barons)\n10: December 23\n11: December 28\n12: December 29\n13: December 31\n\nSo, the relevant rows for Cleveland Barons are row 5 and row 9.\n\nLooking at row 5 (index 5): Opponent is Cleveland Barons on December 11. The score was 11-1 in favor of the Flyers, so points here would be 2 points for a win, but the claim is about December 21st.\n\nRow 9 (index 9) has opponent Cleveland Barons on December 21. Let's check that row:\n\nScore: 4 - 0. So the Flyers won with 4 goals against 0 from Cleveland. The \"points\" column shows 48 points for this game, which would indicate a win (2 points), but the exact points in the score are Flyers' 4 and Barons' 0.\n\nWait, but the claim is that Cleveland scored no points. In hockey, points can refer to goals or to standings points. If it's about goals, then yes, they scored 0. But if it's about standings points (win/loss), since the Flyers won, Cleveland would get 0 points in the standings for this game.\n\nSo in row 9, opponent is Cleveland Barons on December 21st. The score was 4-0, meaning Cleveland scored 0 goals and got 0 standings points because they lost. Therefore, the claim that they scored no points is correct.\n\nNow, compiling relevant cells:\n\n- From row 9 (index 9), we need to check \"opponent\", which is Cleveland Barons, \"december\" for date 21, \"score\" showing 4-0 (Cleveland's 0 goals) and \"points\" as 48, which indicates the team's total points up to that game. But since the claim is about points scored in that specific game against Flyers, it's their opponent's score.\n\nWait, maybe I should focus on the \"score\" column for Cleveland's points. The score is given as \"Flyers - Barons\", so 4-0 means Barons scored 0. So relevant cells would be:\n\n- row_index 9, column \"opponent\": to confirm it's Cleveland Barons\n- row_index 9, column \"december\": date 21\n- row_index 9, column \"score\": shows 4-0, so Barons scored 0.\n\nAlternatively, since the table is about Philadelphia Flyers' games (as per context of the claim against them), the score reflects Flyers' points. So in this case, Cleveland Barons scored 0 goals in that game. Therefore, their points from that game would be 0 in terms of goals, and 0 standings points because they lost.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- opponent (Cleveland Barons)\n- december (21)\n- score (4 - 0, showing Cleveland's 0)\n\nBut in the table, each row represents a game played by the Flyers. So for December 21st, the opponent was Cleveland Barons, and the score was 4-0 in favor of the Flyers. Therefore, Cleveland scored 0 points (goals) that day.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"relevant_rows\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 9,\n            \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 9,\n            \"column_name\": \"december\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 9,\n            \"column_name\": \"score\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a claim about the Philadelphia Flyers losing by five points to the Boston Bruins in the 1977-78 season is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. It has columns: game, december, opponent, score, record, and points. The data starts from game 22 up to game 35, each with corresponding details. \n\nThe claim is about a specific event during that season\u2014losing by five points to Boston. I need to check if such an instance exists in the table.\n\nLooking through the data rows, I'm searching for any games where the opponent is the Boston Bruins and the score indicates a loss by Philadelphia. Let's go row by row:\n\n- Game 22: Opponent is Los Angeles Kings. Not relevant.\n- Game 23: Colorado Rockies. Nope.\n- Game 24: New York Rangers. No.\n- Game 25: New York Rangers again. Still not Bruins.\n- Game 26: Chicago Blackhawks. Not relevant.\n- Game 27: Cleveland Barons. No.\n- Game 28: Here we go, opponent is Boston Bruins. The score is 6-4 in favor of the Bruins. Wait, so Philadelphia lost by two points here because 6-4 means a difference of two.\n- Game 29: Atlanta Flames. Not relevant.\n- Game 30: Montreal Canadiens. No.\n- Game 31: Cleveland Barons again. Doesn't matter.\n- Game 32: Boston Bruins again. The score is 1-6, which is a loss for the Flyers by five points (6-1=5). So this seems to fit the claim.\n\nNow, let's confirm if this game indeed happened in December 1977. Looking at the \"december\" column, Game 32 has a value of 28. I assume this refers to December 28th, which is within the season timeframe mentioned (1977-78). \n\nThe score here was 1-6 in favor of Boston, so Philadelphia lost by five points. Therefore, the claim that they lost by five points to Boston on that date seems accurate based on this data.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are from row 32 where opponent is Boston Bruins and the score is 1-6.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as there's a game against the Boston Bruins where Philadelphia lost by five points.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It mentions a specific game between the Philadelphia Flyers and the Minnesota North Stars in the 1977-78 season where the Flyers won by 3 points.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n- Columns are: \"game\", \"december\", \"opponent\", \"score\", \"record\", \"points\".\n- Each row represents a game played by the team, presumably the Philadelphia Flyers since they're not listed in opponents but the claim is about them.\n\nI need to check if there's a game where the opponent was the Minnesota North Stars and if the score indicates a win by 3 points.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: I'll look through each row for \"opponent\" being \"minnesota north stars\". Scanning the data, row indices 12 (row index starts at 0) has \"opponent\" as \"minnesota north stars\".\n\n2. **Check the Score**: In that row, the \"score\" is \"5 - 2\", which means the team scored 5 points against the opponent's 2. That's a difference of +3.\n\n3. **Determine if it's a Win**: The Flyers (assuming they are the team in the table) won this game since their score is higher.\n\n4. **Points Column**: The \"points\" for that row are 52, which seems to be cumulative points after each game, but the claim refers to the margin of victory, not total points.\n\nHowever, looking at the data again, I realize all rows have \"philadelphia flyers\" as opponents except one where it's \"minnesota north stars\". Wait, no, actually in the table, the opponent is listed for each game. So if this team is playing against Minnesota North Stars and won 5-2, that would be a win by 3 points.\n\nBut wait, I need to ensure the season is correct. The claim mentions \"1977-78\". Looking at the data, December games are listed with days in December (e.g., december: 1, 3, etc.). However, the table doesn't explicitly mention the season year. So I have to assume that this table corresponds to the 1977-78 season since that's what the claim refers to.\n\nAlso, checking if there are any other games against Minnesota North Stars in the table. There is only one row (index 13) where opponent is \"minnesota north stars\".

The claim says: \"the philadelphia flyer lose the 22nd game of the 1977 - 78 season to the colorado rockies.\"\n\nFirst, I should check if there are any games listed as game number 22 in the table. Looking at the data, the first row is game 22. So that's a start.\n\nNext, I need to verify who played in that game. The opponent for game 22 is \"los angeles kings,\" according to the table. The claim says it was against the colorado rockies. That doesn't match up. \n\nAlso, the team involved here is referred to as \"philadelphia flyer\" in the claim, but I don't see any mention of them in this data. All the opponents are different teams like Kings, Rockies, Rangers, etc.\n\nWait a second, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The table shows the games of a specific team, perhaps? Because all the records and points seem to be from one team's perspective. If that's the case, then the team isn't mentioned in the \"game\" column but is implied by the data. However, since the claim mentions Philadelphia Flyers specifically, I need to check if they appear anywhere as the opponent or if this table represents their games.\n\nLooking again, the opponents are Los Angeles Kings, Colorado Rockies (which I think were actually a hockey team at some point), New York Rangers, etc., but there's no mention of Philadelphia Flyers in any row. So it seems like this table isn't about the Flyers but another team.\n\nAdditionally, the record and points increase with each game, so this is likely the season progression of one team. Since the claim is about the Flyers losing to Colorado Rockies, but in the data, game 22 was against Los Angeles Kings, not Colorado, it's clear that the opponent doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.

The task is to determine whether the claim about the Philadelphia Flyers in the 1977-78 season winning most of their games against the New York Rangers is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It states that \"the 1977 - 78 philadelphia flyer win most of the game of the season against the new york ranger.\" So, breaking this down, we're looking at the Flyers' performance against the Rangers during that specific season.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table provided. The columns are: game, december, opponent, score, record, points. Each row represents a game played by the Philadelphia Flyers, I assume, as they have opponents listed and scores with records.\n\nI need to identify all games where the opponent is the New York Rangers. Scanning through the 'opponent' column:\n\n- Game 24: Opponent is New York Rangers.\n- Game 25: Also against New York Rangers.\n- There's another game at row index 33 (assuming rows start at 0), but in this data, looking at each entry, let me count correctly.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the data array:\n\nRow indices (starting from 0):\n\nRow 2: opponent is New York Rangers\nRow 3: same opponent\nRow 12: opponent is New York Rangers again?\n\nWait, let's list all rows where opponent is \"new york rangers\":\n\nLooking through each row in 'data':\n\n- Row 2: game 24 vs NY Rangers (row index 2)\n- Row 3: game 25 vs NY Rangers (row index 3)\n- Row 12: game 33 vs NY Rangers (row index 12)\n\nWait, no.

The 'score' column shows the game result as \"home - away\" or vice versa? Wait, in hockey, typically it's team1 score vs team2 score, but since the table is from the perspective of the Philadelphia Flyers, perhaps the first number is their score.\n\nSo for each NY Ranger opponent row:\n\nRow 2: score \"3 - 3\" \u2192 tie\nRow 3: score \"7 - 4\" \u2192 Flyers won (7-4)\nRow 12: score \"4 - 3\" \u2192 Flyers won (4-3)\n\nWait, but the scores are written as \"home - away\", or is it always Flyers vs opponent? The table doesn't specify home/away, just the opponent. So, perhaps the first number is the Flyers' score, and the second is the opponent's.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 2: 3-3 \u2192 tie\nRow 3:7-4 \u2192 Flyers win\nRow12:4-3 \u2192 Flyers win\n\nSo out of three games against the Rangers, Flyers won two and tied one. The claim says they \"win most of the game,\" which could be interpreted as more wins than losses. Since there are two wins and one tie (no loss), that's majority.\n\nWait, but in sports, a tie is considered neither a win nor a loss, so perhaps it doesn't count towards \"most wins.\" But depending on context, sometimes ties might not factor into the majority. Alternatively, if we consider all outcomes, they have two wins and one tie against NY Rangers. So, in terms of games, 2 out of 3 are wins.\n\nTherefore, the Flyers won most of their games against the Rangers that season.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nRelevant cells would be the rows where opponent is NY Rangers: rows 2,3,12 (row indices 2,3,12). For each of these, we need to check the 'score' column to see if Flyers won. So relevant columns are 'opponent' and 'score'.\n\nBut according to instructions, I should list all cells that were checked.\n\nSo for each of those rows, opponent is NY Rangers (column 'opponent'), and score (to determine outcome).\n\nThus, relevant_cells will be:\n\n- row_index 2: column_name \"opponent\" and \"score\"\n- row_index3: same\n- row_index12: same\n\nWait, but in the output format, it's a list of each cell individually. So I think we need to list each as separate entries.\n\nSo for row 2: opponent and score\nRow 3: opponent and score\nRow12: opponent and score\n\nTherefore, the JSON should include all these cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the 1977 - 78 philadelphia flyer lose by 3 points to the boston bruin\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, let me understand what the table contains. The table has columns: game, december, opponent, score, record, and points. Each row represents a specific game played in December, with details about the opponent, the game's score, the team's record after that game, and points.\n\nThe claim mentions the 1977-78 Philadelphia Flyers losing by 3 points to the Boston Bruins. I need to check if such an event exists in the table.\n\nLooking at the 'opponent' column, I see entries like \"los angeles kings\", \"colorado rockies\", \"new york rangers\", etc. There's no mention of \"philadelphia flyers\" in the opponent column. The opponents listed are other teams, but not Philadelphia. So, does that mean the team represented in the table is actually the Boston Bruins or another team? Wait, the claim talks about the Philadelphia Flyers losing to Boston, so perhaps I need to check if any game shows a loss by 3 points where the opponent was the Boston Bruins.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The table might be for a specific team's games against others. If it's from the perspective of the team in question (maybe the Flyers?), but looking at the data, the 'opponent' is who they played against. So if the claim is about the Flyers losing to Boston, then I should look for a row where opponent is \"boston bruins\" and see if the score indicates a loss by 3 points.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nRow 6: Game 28 vs \"boston bruins\", score was 6-4. So the team in the table scored 6, Boston scored 4. Wait, that would mean they won by 2 points, not lost. But the claim says Philadelphia lost by 3 points.\n\nAnother row where opponent is Boston: Row 11 (game 32), score was 1-6. So the team in the table scored 1, Boston scored 6. That's a loss by 5 points (difference of 5). The claim mentions losing by 3 points, so that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the 'score' column. Maybe it's the opponent's score first? Let me check another row. For example, game 22: score is 4-2 against LA Kings. If the team in question scored 4 and lost, but that would mean they won. So perhaps the format is [team's score] - [opponent's score]. Therefore, a loss would have opponent's score higher.\n\nIn row 6 (game 28), score 6-4: our team scored 6, opponent 4. They won. In row 11 (game 32), score is 1-6: our team scored 1, lost by 5 points.\n\nSo in the table, there's no instance where they lost to Boston by exactly 3 points. The closest was a loss of 5 points against Boston in game 32. \n\nTherefore, the claim that Philadelphia lost by 3 points to Boston is not supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the 1977 - 78 philadelphia flyer win by 3 point against the boston bruin.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the elements of the claim. It mentions a specific season (1977-78), a team (Philadelphia Flyers), their victory with a 3-point margin against the Boston Bruins.\n\nLooking at the table columns: game number, December date, opponent, score, record, and points. The relevant information would be in the 'opponent' column to see if it's against the Boston Bruins and the 'score' column to check the point difference.\n\nI'll go through each row of data:\n\n- Row 7 has opponent \"boston bruins\" with a score of \"6 - 4\". Calculating the points, 6-4 is a 2-point win.\n- Row 12 also lists \"boston bruins\" as the opponent. The score here is \"1 - 6\", which is a loss for the Flyers by 5 points.\n\nWait, but the team in the table isn't specified; it just says 'opponent'. I'm assuming this data represents Philadelphia Flyers' games since the claim refers to them. So each row shows the opponent they played against.\n\nLooking at all rows where \"opponent\" is Boston Bruins (rows 7 and 12), neither game resulted in a 3-point win. The closest was a 2-point win in row 7, but that's not 3 points. \n\nTherefore, there's no instance in the table where the Flyers won by exactly 3 points against the Bruins. So the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells would be rows 7 and 12 under 'opponent' and 'score' columns to check both games against Boston.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
