Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"the away team for both 14 july 2007 and on 20 july 2007 be perth glory.\" So, the claim is stating that on these two dates, Perth Glory was the away team in both matches.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: round, date, home team, score, away team, crowd, stadium. The data rows are from index 0 to 4.\n\nFor each date mentioned, I'll check the corresponding row to see who the away team is.\n\nStarting with 14 July 2007. Looking at the table, that's the first row (index 0). The home team is Newcastle Jets, and the away team is Perth Glory. So, yes, on this date, Perth Glory was the away team. That matches the claim.\n\nNext, checking 20 July 2007, which is the second row (index 1). Here, Adelaide United is the home team, and again, the away team is Perth Glory. So that also aligns with the claim.\n\nSince both dates have Perth Glory as the away team, the claim holds true. I don't see any discrepancies in the data provided. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"Perth Glory be the away team on 4 August 2007 and on 12 August 2007.\" \n\nFirst, I should parse the table correctly. Let me look at the structure. The table has columns: round, date, home team, score, away team, crowd, stadium. And there are five rows of data.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific dates: 4 August 2007 and 12 August 2007. I need to check for each of these dates whether Perth Glory was the away team on those days.\n\nLet's go through each date one by one.\n\nStarting with 4 August 2007. Looking at the data rows, row index 3 has the date \"4 august 2007\". So, let me see what the 'away team' is for that row. In row 3, the away team is Perth Glory because in column \"away team\", it's listed as \"perth glory\" (assuming case-insensitive). Wait no, looking back, row 3 has \"central coast mariners\" as home team and \"perth glory\" as the away team? Let me double-check: The data for row 3 is [ \"sf\", \"4 august 2007\", \"central coast mariners\", \"2 - 3\", \"perth glory\", 5967, \"bluetongue central coast stadium\" ]. So yes, on 4 August 2007, Perth Glory was the away team.\n\nNext, checking 12 August 2007. Looking at row index 4, the date is \"12 august 2007\". The 'away team' in that row is again \"perth glory\" because the data is [ \"gf\", \"12 august 2007\", \"adelaide united\", \"2 - 1\", \"perth glory\", 9606, \"hindmarsh stadium\" ]. So on this date as well, Perth Glory was the away team.\n\nSo both instances check out. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to collect the relevant cells that were checked. For each of these two dates, I looked at the 'date' column and the 'away team' column.\n\nFor 4 August 2007:\n- row index 3, column 'date'\n- row index 3, column 'away team'\n\nFor 12 August 2007:\n- row index 4, column 'date'\n- row index 4, column 'away team'\n\nSo the relevant cells are rows 3 and 4 for both date and away team columns.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n   ]\n}",

The claim says: \"the crowd on 4 august 2007 at bluetongue central coast stadium be larger than the crowd on 20 july 2007 at hindmarsh stadium.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse the JSON to understand the structure. It has columns: round, date, home team, score, away team, crowd, and stadium. The data is a list of rows with these values.\n\nLooking for the relevant entries in the table:\n\n1. For 4 August 2007 at Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium:\n   - Scanning through each row, I find this in the fourth entry (row index 3). Let me check: date is \"4 august 2007\", stadium is \"bluetongue central coast stadium\". The crowd here is 5967.\n\n2. For 20 July 2007 at Hindmarsh Stadium:\n   - Looking through the rows, this is in the second entry (row index 1). Date matches \"20 july 2007\", stadium is \"hindmarsh stadium\". The crowd here is 3513.\n\nNow, comparing the two crowds: 5967 vs. 3513. Clearly, 5967 is larger than 3513. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nI need to identify which cells were relevant for this determination. For the first part of the claim (4 August), I looked at row index 3 and checked the 'crowd' column. For the second part (20 July), I examined row index 1's 'crowd'. Therefore, both these cells are important in verifying the claim.\n\nSo, compiling this into the required JSON format: answer is \"TRUE\", relevant_cells includes the two crowd entries from rows 3 and 1.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

There are five rows of data.\n\nLooking at the dates mentioned in the claim: 20 July 2007 and 12 August 2007.\n\nI'll start by finding the row for 20 July 2007.

So, the first part of the claim checks out.\n\nNext, check for 12 August 2007:\n\n- Row 4: 12 August 2007 \u2013 this is the correct date. The home team in this row is also Adelaide United. Thus, the second part of the claim is also satisfied.\n\nBoth dates correspond to games where Adelaide United was the home team.

The columns are: round, date, home team, score, away team, crowd, stadium. There are five data rows.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific dates: 4 August 2007 and 12 August 2007. I need to check each of these dates in the table to see if Adelaide United was the away team on both occasions.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n1. The first row is round 1, date 14 July 2007: away team is Perth Glory.\n2. Second row: round 2, date 20 July 2007: away team is also Perth Glory.\n3. Third row: round 3, date 28 July 2007: away team is Melbourne Victory.\n4. Fourth row: round sf (probably semi-finals), date 4 August 2007. Here, the home team is Central Coast Mariners and away team is Perth Glory again.\n5. Fifth row: round gf (grand finals?), date 12 August 2007. Home team is Adelaide United, so the away team would be whoever they are playing against.\n\nWait, in the fifth row, the date is 12 August 2007. The home team is Adelaide United, which means the away team isn't specified here; the 'away team' column has Perth Glory as the opponent for Adelaide United on that date? Wait no, looking at the data:\n\nRow index 4 (fifth row):\n- round: gf\n- date: 12 august 2007\n- home team: adelaide united\n- away team: perth glory\n\nSo, in this case, on 12 August, Adelaide United is the home team, not the away team. The claim says they were the away team on both dates.\n\nBut for 4 August, looking at row index 3 (fourth data row):\n- date: 4 august 2007\n- home team: central coast mariners\n- away team: perth glory\n\nSo Adelaide United isn't listed as an away team here either. Wait a second, did I miss any other rows?\n\nWait, maybe I should check all the 'away team' columns for both dates mentioned in the claim.\n\nFor 4 August 2007 (row index 3), the away team is Perth Glory.\n\nFor 12 August 2007 (row index 4), the home team is Adelaide United, so they are not the away team here. The away team is Perth Glory again.\n\nTherefore, on both dates mentioned in the claim (4 and 12 August 2007), Adelaide United was NOT the away team. They were the home team on 12 August.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE because Adelaide United wasn't the away team on either date; they were the home team on one of them, and Perth Glory was the away team on both dates.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The claim says \"adelaide unite be the away team on 4 august 2007 and on 12 august 2007\". So for both dates, Adelaide should have been the away team.\n\nLooking at row index 3 (4 August): away team is Perth Glory. So not Adelaide.\n\nRow index 4 (12 August): home team is Adelaide United; so they were home, not away.\n\nSo on neither date was Adelaide United the away team. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\nFor 4 August: row_index 3, column 'away team' which shows Perth Glory.\nFor 12 August: row_index 4, column 'home team' which shows Adelaide United.\n\nBut since the claim is about them being away on both dates, and in reality, they were home on one date, the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Adelaide United was the away team on both specified dates. Checking each date:\n\n- On 4 August 2007 (row 3), the away team was Perth Glory.\n- On 12 August 2007 (row 4), Adelaide United was the home team.\n\nThus, Adelaide United was not the away team on either date.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Scanning through each row:\n\n1. The first row is from July 14, 2007, at Port Macquarie Regional Stadium. Not matching.\n2. The second row is on July 20, 2007, at Hindmarsh Stadium. But wait, that's not the date mentioned in the claim. So this might be relevant later when comparing crowds but not directly for the specific match on August 4th.\n3. The third row is July 28, 2007, at Darwin Football Stadium. Doesn't fit.\n4. The fourth row is on August 4, 2007, with \"Central Coast Mariners\" vs. Perth Glory. The stadium here is Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium. Oh, so that's not Hindmarsh Stadium. So this doesn't match the claim either.\n5. The fifth row is on August 12, 2007, at Hindmarsh Stadium between Adelaide United and Perth Glory.\n\nWait a second, looking back, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check each row again. Maybe I missed something in the fourth row. Oh no, the fourth row's date is August 4, but the stadium is Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium, not Hindmarsh. So that can't be the match the claim is referring to.\n\nLooking at the fifth row: August 12, Hindmarsh Stadium. That's different from the claim which mentions August 4. Wait, maybe I misread? The fourth row has date \"4 august 2007\" but stadium Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium. So where is the match on August 4 at Hindmarsh?\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I need to check again. Let me look through all rows:\n\nRow 1: 14 July, Port Macquarie\nRow 2: 20 July, Hindmarsh\nRow 3: 28 July, Darwin\nRow 4: 4 August, Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium (so not Hindmarsh)\nRow 5: 12 August, Hindmarsh\n\nSo according to the data provided, there's no match on 4 August at Hindmarsh Stadium. The only matches at Hindmarsh are on July 20 and August 12.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe \"4 august\" is a semi-finals or finals? Let me check: row 4 has round \"sf\", which might stand for semifinals, but the stadium there isn't Hindmarsh. So that's not it.\n\nTherefore, the claim mentions a match on August 4 at Hindmarsh Stadium, but according to the data, such a match doesn't exist. The only matches at Hindmarsh are July 20 and August 12. \n\nSo if the crowd in question is supposed to be on August 4 at Hindmarsh, which isn't present, then there's no such crowd. Alternatively, maybe I misread the stadium? Let me check row 4 again: it says \"Bluetongue central coast stadium.\" So that can't be Hindmarsh.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is referring to a different stadium or date. But as per the data given, August 4's match isn't at Hindmarsh. Therefore, the crowd in question doesn't exist in our dataset.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting \"4 august\" and the other entries. Let me check all rows:\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 0: 14 July\nRow 1: 20 July, Hindmarsh (crowd 3513)\nRow 2: 28 July, Darwin (crowd 2700)\nRow 3: 4 August, Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium (crowd 5967)\nRow 4: 12 August, Hindmarsh (crowd 9606)\n\nAh, so the claim is about 4 August at Hindmarsh, but row 3 has 4 August but at a different stadium. So there's no match on 4 August at Hindmarsh in our data.\n\nTherefore, since the crowd on 4 August at Hindmarsh isn't present, we can't compare it to others because it doesn't exist. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is about another date or stadium.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check row indexes again:\n\nRow 0: index 0\nRow 1: index 1 (20 July at Hindmarsh)\nRow 2: index 2 (28 July at Darwin)\nRow 3: index 3 (4 August at Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium, crowd 5967)\nRow 4: index 4 (12 August at Hindmarsh, crowd 9606)\n\nSo the claim is about \"4 august 2007\" and \"hindmarsh stadium.\" In our data, row 3 is on 4 Aug but at a different stadium. So perhaps the claim refers to row 3? But no, because the stadium isn't Hindmarsh.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the date in row 4. Let me check:\n\nRow 4's date is \"12 august 2007\" at Hindmarsh with crowd 9606. That's the largest crowd in the data (9606). So if the claim was about that, it would be true.\n\nBut the claim says \"on 4 august 2007 at hindmarsh stadium.\" Since there is no such match, perhaps the claim is false because the supposed crowd doesn't exist. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding which rows are relevant.\n\nWait another angle: Perhaps the claim is that on August 4th at Hindmarsh, the crowd was larger than any other. But in our data, there's no August 4th at Hindmarsh, so that match didn't occur according to the table. Therefore, the claim can't be true because the event mentioned isn't present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to check if on August 4th, regardless of stadium, the crowd was larger than any other. Let's see: row 3 has crowd 5967 on August 4 at Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium. The largest crowd is in row 4 (12 Aug, Hindmarsh) with 9606. So even if we consider August 4th, the crowd was 5967, which isn't larger than 9606.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The claim says \"on 4 august 2007 at hindmarsh stadium\" - but in our data, there's no such match. Therefore, the statement is false because that event doesn't exist in the given data.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume a typo and consider August 12th at Hindmarsh, then that's the largest crowd (9606). But as per the claim, it's about August 4th at Hindmarsh, which isn't present. So the statement is false because there was no such match with that date and stadium.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding: maybe \"on 4 august\" refers to a different row? Let me check:\n\nRow 3: 4 Aug, Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium, crowd 5967\nRow 4: 12 Aug, Hindmarsh, 9606\n\nSo the largest crowd is on 12 Aug at Hindmarsh. So if someone claims that on 4 Aug at Hindmarsh, the crowd was larger than any other, which isn't true because there's no such match in the data.\n\nTherefore, based on the given data, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false. According to the provided data, there is no match on August 4th at Hindmarsh Stadium. The only matches at Hindmarsh are on July 20th with a crowd of 3513 and on August 12th with a crowd of 9606, which is the largest crowd in the dataset. Therefore, the statement about a larger crowd on August 4th at Hindmarsh cannot be true based on the given information.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false. There was no match on August 4th at Hindmarsh Stadium according to the provided data.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table in JSON format. The claim says: \"the stadium use for the game on 12 august 2007 be same stadium use in the game on 28 july 2007.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is asking. It's checking if two specific games were played at the same stadium. One game was on 12 August 2007, and the other was on 28 July 2007. I need to find both these entries in the table and compare their 'stadium' columns.\n\nLooking at the JSON data provided:\n\nThe table has several rows with information about different matches, including the round, date, home team, score, away team, crowd size, and stadium.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one. \n\nRow 0: Date is 14 July 2007.\nRow 1: Date is 20 July 2007.\nRow 2: Date is 28 July 2007. This seems to be the first game we need because the claim mentions 28 July. Let me note this row's stadium, which is \"darwin football stadium\".\n\nNow, looking for 12 August 2007. That should be in another row.\n\nRow 3: Date is 4 August 2007.\nRow 4: Date is 12 August 2007. This is the second game mentioned in the claim. The stadium here is \"hindmarsh stadium\".\n\nSo, for the two dates:\n- 28 July 2007: Stadium is Darwin Football Stadium\n- 12 August 2007: Stadium is Hindmarsh Stadium\n\nComparing these, they are different. Therefore, the claim that both games were played at the same stadium is FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells in the table for each date and stadium.\n\nFor 28 July 2007:\n- The row index is 2.\n- Columns involved: 'date' (to confirm it's 28 July) and 'stadium' (to get the name).\n\nFor 12 August 2007:\n- The row index is 4.\n- Similarly, 'date' and 'stadium'.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 2, column 'date'\n- Row 2, column 'stadium'\n- Row 4, column 'date'\n- Row 4, column 'stadium'\n\nWait a second. Let me double-check if I'm including all necessary columns to support my conclusion.\n\nYes, because for each date, we need the corresponding stadium. So each relevant cell is both the date and the stadium for those two rows.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the stadiums for the games on 28 July and 12 August are different.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
