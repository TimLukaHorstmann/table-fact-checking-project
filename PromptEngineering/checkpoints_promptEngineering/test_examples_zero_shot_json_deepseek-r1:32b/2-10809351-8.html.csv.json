    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"during the 1949 vfl season, prince park venue record the highest crowd participation\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll check each part of the claim against the data in the table. The key points are:\n\n1. **Year and Season**: The claim mentions the 1949 VFL season. Looking at the 'date' column, all entries are \"4 june 1949,\" which falls within the 1949 season.\n\n2. **Venue in Question**: The claim refers to \"prince park.\" In the table, one of the venues is listed as \"princes park\" (row index 2). This seems like a match, though there's a slight spelling difference (\"Prince Park\" vs. \"Princes Park\"), but it's likely referring to the same place.\n\n3. **Crowd Participation**: The claim states that Prince Park recorded the highest crowd participation. To verify this, I need to look at the 'crowd' column for each venue.\n\nLooking at the data:\n- Row 0: Kardinia Park, crowd of 22500\n- Row 1: Victoria Park, crowd of 12000\n- Row 2: Princes Park, crowd of 29500\n- Row 3: MCG, crowd of 11000\n- Row 4: Lake Oval, crowd of 12500\n- Row 5: Western Oval, crowd of 12500\n\nThe highest crowd number is 29500 at Princes Park (row index 2). All other venues have lower crowd numbers. Therefore, the claim that Prince Park had the highest crowd participation during the 1949 VFL season is correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are where the venue is \"princes park\" and its corresponding crowd number.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

South Melbourne as the home team has a score of 12.7 (79).\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Geelong vs Richmond at Kardinia Park on June 4, 1949. Home team is Geelong with a score of 10.15 (75). This doesn't relate to Melbourne or South Melbourne.\n\n- Row 1: Collingwood vs St Kilda at Victoria Park on the same date.

The claim states: \"western oval be 1 of the 2 venue that record a crowd participation of 12500 each.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It claims that there are two venues where the crowd was exactly 12500, and Western Oval is one of them.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns include \"venue\" and \"crowd\". So, for each row, I can check the venue and the corresponding crowd number.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Venue is Kardinia Park, crowd is 22500. Not relevant.\nRow 1: Venue is Victoria Park, crowd is 12000. Not matching 12500.\nRow 2: Venue is Princes Park, crowd is 29500. Doesn't match.\nRow 3: Venue is MCG, crowd is 11000. Nope.\nRow 4: Venue is Lake Oval, crowd is 12500. This matches the crowd number mentioned in the claim.\nRow 5: Venue is Western Oval, crowd is 12500. Also matches.\n\nSo, according to the table, there are two venues with a crowd of 12500 each: Lake Oval and Western Oval. Therefore, Western Oval is indeed one of the two venues that recorded this crowd participation.\n\nThe claim says \"1 of the 2 venue\", which aligns with what I found.

The claim says, \"victoria park be 1 of the 6 venue that be in use on 4 june 1949.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this claim. It seems like it's saying that Victoria Park was one of six venues used on June 4, 1949. I should check if Victoria Park is listed as a venue and whether the date matches.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", \"away team score\", \"venue\", \"crowd\", and \"date\". So each row represents a game with details including the venue where it was played and the date of the match.\n\nI need to go through each row and check two things: whether the venue is Victoria Park and whether the date is June 4, 1949.\n\nLooking at the data:\n- Row 0: Venue is Kardinia Park. Date is June 4, 1949.\n- Row 1: Venue is Victoria Park. Date is June 4, 1949. So this matches.\n- Row 2: Princes Park. Same date.\n- Row 3: MCg. Date same.\n- Row 4: Lake Oval. Date same.\n- Row 5: Western Oval. Date same.\n\nSo, how many venues are listed? Each row has a venue, and the claim says six venues were in use on that date because there are six rows. Now, I need to check if each of these venues is unique or if some repeat.\n\nLooking at the venues:\n1. Kardinia Park\n2. Victoria Park\n3. Princes Park\n4. MCg (probably Melbourne Cricket Ground)\n5. Lake Oval\n6. Western Oval\n\nEach venue in the rows seems distinct. So, there are six different venues listed on June 4, 1949. Since Victoria Park is one of them (specifically in row 1), the claim holds true.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells include the 'venue' column from each of the six rows because all are part of verifying that there were six different venues used on that date.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Victoria Park was one of six venues used on June 4, 1949.

It has columns like home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a game played on June 4, 1949.\n\nThe claim compares two venues: Kardinia Park and Western Oval. Specifically, it's saying that Kardinia Park had a crowd of 10,000 more than Western Oval. So I need to find the crowd numbers for both venues from the data.\n\nLooking through the data rows:\n\n- The first row is about Geelong vs Richmond at Kardinia Park with a crowd of 22500.\n- The last row is Footscray vs Essendon at Western Oval with a crowd of 12500.\n\nSo, Kardinia Park had 22,500 attendees and Western Oval had 12,500. To check if Kardinia has 10,000 more, I subtract: 22,500 - 12,500 = 10,000.\n\nWait, that's exactly the difference mentioned in the claim. So the claim is TRUE because the crowd at Kardinia Park was indeed 10,000 more than Western Oval.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Kardinia Park had a crowd of 10,000 more than Western Oval.

Each row represents a game played on June 4, 1949.\n\nThe claim mentions Prince Park (I think it's a typo for Princes Park) and says that during the 1949 VFL season, this venue had the lowest crowd participation. \n\nSo I need to check two things: \n1. Is there a game at Princes Park in the table?\n2. What was the crowd size there compared to other venues on the same day?\n\nLooking through the data rows:\n- The third row has \"princes park\" as the venue and a crowd of 29500.\n- Other venues have varying crowd numbers: Kardinia Park had 22500, Victoria Park 12000, mcg 11000, Lake Oval 12500, Western Oval 12500.\n\nWait a minute, actually, the third row's venue is Princes Park with 29500.

The relevant column here is \"venue\" and \"date\".\n\nI'll start by examining each row to see which ones have the date \"4 june 1949\". From the data provided, all six entries have this date. So, there are indeed six matches on that day.\n\nNext, I need to check each venue in these rows. Let's list them out:\n\n1. Kardinia Park\n2. Victoria Park\n3.

The columns are: \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", \"away team score\", \"venue\", \"crowd\", and \"date\". There are six rows of data corresponding to different games on June 4, 1949.\n\nThe claim mentions two home teams: Melbourne and South Melbourne. I need to find their respective scores in the table to verify if they match what's stated.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. The first row is Geelong vs Richmond at Kardinia Park with a crowd of 22,500 on June 4, 1949. Not relevant here.\n2. The second row is Collingwood vs St Kilda at Victoria Park with a crowd of 12,000. Again, not the teams we're looking for.\n3. The third row lists Carlton as the home team against North Melbourne at Princes Park with a crowd of 29,500. Still not our target teams.\n4. The fourth row is Melbourne vs Hawthorn at the MCG with a crowd of 11,000. Here, Melbourne is the home team. According to the claim, their score should be 14.13 (97). Looking at the \"home team score\" column for this row: it's listed as 10.17 (77). Hmm, that doesn't match. So right away, there's a discrepancy here because the claimed home score is higher than what's in the table.\n\nMoving on to check South Melbourne:\n5. The fifth row shows South Melbourne as the home team against Fitzroy at Lake Oval with 12,500 attendees. The claim says their home score is 12.7 (79). Checking the \"home team score\" here: it's indeed 12.7 (79). That matches.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n- Melbourne's claimed score is 14.13 (97), but the table shows 10.17 (77).\n- South Melbourne's score matches as per the claim.\n\nSince one part of the claim doesn't hold true, the entire statement is false.

It's saying that western oval is one of two venues where the crowd was exactly 11,000 each.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll check each row for the venue and the crowd number.\n\nThe columns are:\n- home team\n- home team score\n- away team\n- away team score\n- venue\n- crowd\n- date\n\nSo, for each row, I need to look at 'venue' and 'crowd'.\n\nLet's go through each data row:\n\n1.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says that Kardinia Park had a crowd of 10,000 more participants than Lake Oval. \n\nFirst, I need to find the rows where the venue is Kardinia Park and Lake Oval. Looking at the data:\n\n- Row 0: Venue is Kardinia Park with a crowd of 22500.\n- Row 4: Venue is Lake Oval with a crowd of 12500.\n\nSo, Kardinia Park had 22,500 people and Lake Oval had 12,500. The difference between them is 22,500 - 12,500 = 10,000. That means the claim is correct because Kardinia Park indeed had exactly 10,000 more participants than Lake Oval.\n\nNow, I'll note which cells are relevant. For Kardinia Park, it's row 0 under 'crowd'. For Lake Oval, it's row 4 under 'crowd' as well.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because the difference in crowd numbers between Kardinia Park and Lake Oval is exactly 10,000.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" }\n   ]\n}\n```",
