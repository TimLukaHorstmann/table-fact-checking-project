    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"corinthian draw more game than aa s\u00e3o bento\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format. Let me start by understanding what each part of this claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim compares two teams: Corinthians and AA S\u00e3o Bento. It's saying that Corinthians drew more games than AA S\u00e3o Bento. So I need to look at the number of drawn games for both teams from the table.\n\nLooking at the JSON structure, the table has columns like position, team, points, played, drawn, lost, against, difference. The relevant column here is \"drawn,\" which indicates the number of games each team drew.\n\nNow, I'll go through the data to find the rows corresponding to Corinthians and AA S\u00e3o Bento.\n\nFor Corinthians:\n- Looking at row 0 (since indexing starts from 0), the team name is \"corinthians.\" The drawn column in this row has a value of 2. So Corinthians have drawn 2 games.\n\nFor AA S\u00e3o Bento:\n- Scanning through the data, I see that in row 7, the team is \"aa s\u00e3 o bento\" (with some encoding issues, but I assume it's the correct team). The drawn column here has a value of 1. So AA S\u00e3o Bento drew only 1 game.\n\nNow, comparing the two: Corinthians have 2 draws, and AA S\u00e3o Bento has 1 draw. Since 2 is more than 1, the claim that \"corinthian draw more game than aa s\u00e3o bento\" is TRUE.\n\nTo identify the relevant cells for this conclusion:\n- For Corinthians (row 0), I look at the \"drawn\" column.\n- For AA S\u00e3o Bento (row 7), I also check the \"drawn\" column.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells should include these two entries with their respective row indices and column names.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Corinthians have more drawn games than AA S\u00e3o Bento. \n\n**Step-by-step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Teams:** Locate both teams in the table\u2014Corinthians (row 0) and AA S\u00e3o Bento (row 7).\n\n2. **Extract Drawn Games:**\n   - Corinthians: 2 draws\n   - AA S\u00e3o Bento: 1 draw\n\n3. **Comparison:** Since 2 > 1, the claim holds.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what each column represents.\n\nLooking at the columns: position, team, points, played, drawn, lost, against, difference. The relevant part here is the \"played\" column because that tells me how many games each team has played.\n\nThe claim says all teams have played the same number of games, so I should check if every team in the \"played\" column has the same value. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. Corinthians: 18\n2. Palestra It\u00e1lia - SP: 18\n3. S\u00e3o Paulo: 18 (Wait, no\u2014actually it says \"s\u00e9rio\", maybe that's a typo or another team.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"aa da palmeiras have the smallest positive point difference\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what \"point difference\" means in the context of a sports table. Typically, it refers to the goal difference, which is calculated as goals scored minus goals against. A positive point difference would mean that the team has scored more goals than they've conceded.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a team with their respective statistics. The columns we're interested in are \"team\" and \"difference\". The claim specifically mentions \"aa da palmeiras,\" so I'll locate their row first.\n\nFrom the data provided:\n- Row 5 (0-based index) is \"aa das palmeiras\".\n- Their point difference is listed as \"8\".\n\nNow, to verify if this is the smallest positive difference, I need to check all other teams' differences. Let's go through each team:\n\n1. Corinthians: Difference is \"53\" (positive).\n2. Palestra It\u00e1lia - SP: \"24\" (positive).\n3. S\u00e3o Paulo? Wait, no, row 2 is \"s\u00e9rio\", which I think refers to another team. Their difference is \"17\".\n4. Paulistano: Also \"17\".\n5. aa das palmeiras: \"8\".\n6. Ypiranga - SP: \"-2\" (negative).\n7. Minas Gerais: \"-29\" (negative).\n8. aa S\u00e3o Bento: \"-7\" (negative).\n\nSo, among the teams with positive differences, we have 53, 24, 17, 17, and 8. The smallest positive number here is 8, which belongs to \"aa das palmeiras\". Therefore, their point difference is indeed the smallest positive one in the table.\n\nI should also check if there are any other teams with a positive difference smaller than 8. From the data, all other positive differences are higher than 8, so no team has a smaller positive difference than \"aa das palmeiras\".\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"difference\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that Paulistano does not have the highest points in the table. So, my task is to check if there's any team with more points than Paulistano.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are position, team, points, played, drawn, lost, against, and difference. The key column here is \"points\" since that's what the claim is about.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to find the points for Paulistano and compare it with others. \n\n- Row 0: Corinthians have 30 points.\n- Row 1: Palestra Italia - SP has 29 points.\n- Row 2: S\u00e3o Paulo (I think that's what \"s\u00e9rio\" refers to) has 26 points.\n- Row 3: Paulistano has 22 points.\n- The rest have fewer points than Paulistano.\n\nSo, looking at the data, Corinthians are at the top with 30 points. Since 30 is more than Paulistano's 22, this means Paulistano indeed doesn't score the most points. \n\nTo support this, I'll need to reference the relevant cells in the table. The key ones are where the team names and their corresponding points are listed. Specifically:\n\n- Corinthians' position and points.\n- Paulistano's position and points.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be from rows 0 and 3 for the \"team\" and \"points\" columns.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there is at least one team (Corinthians) with more points than Paulistano.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"s\u00edrio win more game than corinthian lost\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break down the steps carefully.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that S\u00edrio won more games than Corinthians lost. So, I need to find out how many games S\u00edrio won and how many games Corinthians lost.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a team with their statistics. The columns include \"points\", \"played\", \"drawn\", \"lost\", etc. Since wins aren't directly listed, but we know that in football (soccer) points are typically awarded as 3 for a win, 1 for a draw, and 0 for a loss. So, if I can figure out the number of wins from the points column.\n\nLet me start by locating S\u00edrio's row. Scanning through the data, S\u00edrio is at row index 2 (since indexing starts at 0). Their \"points\" are 26, and they've drawn 4 games, lost 3. The total games played are 18. So, wins can be calculated as:\n\nWins = Total Played - Drawn - Lost\nWins for S\u00edrio: 18 - 4 - 3 = 11.\n\nNow, moving on to Corinthians. They're at row index 0. Their \"lost\" column shows 2 losses.\n\nThe claim is whether S\u00edrio's wins (11) are more than Corinthians' lost games (2). Comparing these numbers: 11 > 2, so the claim holds true.\n\nNext, I need to identify the relevant cells for each part of the claim. For S\u00edrio's wins, we used their \"points\", \"drawn\", and \"lost\" columns, but since points were given as 26, it's implied that this is from 11 wins (each worth 3 points) plus 4 draws (4*1=4), totaling 37? Wait, wait a second. Hold on, maybe I made a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, if S\u00edrio has 26 points and they drew 4 games, each draw gives 1 point, so that's 4 points from draws. The remaining points would be from wins: 26 - 4 = 22 points. Since each win is worth 3 points, then the number of wins would be 22 / 3 \u22487.33, which isn't possible because you can't have a fraction of a game. Hmm, this seems contradictory to my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. If S\u00edrio has played 18 games, with 4 draws and 3 losses, that's 7 non-wins (4+3). So the number of wins is 18 -7=11. But if they have 26 points, how does this reconcile? Let's see: 11 wins would give 33 points (11*3), but S\u00edrio has only 26 points. That doesn't add up.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I misunderstood the point system. Maybe in this context, each win is worth more than 3 points or there's a different calculation. Alternatively, maybe the table uses a different scoring method. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"points\" column includes draws as 1 and wins as some other value, but if it's standard soccer, then each win is 3 points, draw is 1, loss is 0. So let's recalculate S\u00edrio's points:\n\nIf they have 26 points from 18 games, with 4 draws (each worth 1 point = 4) and some wins.\n\nLet me denote:\nWins: W\nDraws: D=4\nLosses: L=3\n\nTotal games: W + D + L = 18 \u2192 W +4+3=W+7=18 \u2192 W=11.\n\nPoints from draws: D*1=4.\nPoints from wins: W*3=33.\nBut total points are given as 26. So 33 (from wins) +4 (draws)=37, which doesn't match the table's 26 points for S\u00edrio.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests a problem with my initial assumption. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the data. Let me double-check the data again.\n\nLooking back at the JSON:\n\nFor S\u00edrio:\n- Points: 26\n- Played:18\n- Drawn:4\n- Lost:3\n\nSo total games: 18 = W + D + L \u2192 W=18 -4-3=11. But points from wins would be 11*3=33, plus draws (4*1)=4, totaling 37 points, but the table shows only 26.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that either the point system is different, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding what \"points\" represent here. Alternatively, maybe \"drawn\" refers to something else, but in standard terms, drawn games are tied and give each team a point.\n\nWait, perhaps it's not football. Maybe another sport where points per win differ? Or perhaps the table uses a different scoring method. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in looking at the data.\n\nLet me check again: S\u00edrio is row index 2. Their points are indeed 26. Drawn=4, lost=3. So if 18 games total, then wins would be 11 as before.\n\nBut according to this calculation, their points should be 3*W + D = 3*11 +4=37, but the table says 26. That doesn't match. So perhaps I'm miscalculating something else.\n\nWait, maybe the \"points\" column isn't about wins and draws in terms of points, but it's a different metric, like goal difference or something else? No, typically, points are accumulated based on game outcomes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is from a different competition where each win gives 2 points instead of 3. Let me test that: if W=11 wins at 2 points each would be 22 points, plus D=4 draws at 1 point each (total 4), giving 26 points total. That adds up.\n\nSo perhaps in this context, a win is worth 2 points and a draw is 1 point, which isn't the standard football system but possible elsewhere. So if that's the case:\n\nS\u00edrio: 11 wins *2 =22 +4 draws*1=4 \u2192 total 26 points.\n\nIn that case, S\u00edrio has indeed 11 wins. Then Corinthians have lost 2 games.\n\nSo the initial conclusion holds: 11 > 2, so the claim is true.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\nFor S\u00edrio's wins:\n- Points (row index 2): 26\n- Drawn (same row):4\n- Lost (same row):3\n\nBut since we derived wins from W= played - drawn - lost, perhaps only the \"lost\" column for Corinthians is directly used.\n\nWait, but in reality, to get S\u00edrio's wins, we needed their total games, draws, and losses. So relevant cells are:\n\nFor S\u00edrio:\n- Played:18 (row index 2)\n- Drawn:4\n- Lost:3\n\nAnd for Corinthians:\n- Lost:2 (row index0)\n\nBut perhaps the user wants only the directly referenced cells.\n\nIn any case, since the points given in the table don't align with standard win/draw point systems, but assuming that wins can be calculated from total games minus draws and losses, then S\u00edrio has 11 wins, which is more than Corinthians' 2 losses.\n\nSo the answer should be yes, and identify the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that S\u00edrio's number of wins exceeds Corinthians' number of losses. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Determine S\u00edrio's Wins:**\n   - Total games played by S\u00edrio: 18\n   - Drawn games: 4\n   - Lost games: 3\n   - Therefore, wins = Total games - Drawn - Lost = 18 - 4 - 3 = 11\n\n2. **Determine Corinthians' Losses:**\n   - Losses for Corinthians: 2\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers:**\n   - S\u00edrio's wins (11) are greater than Corinthians' losses (2).\n\n**Relevant Cells Identified:**\n\n- For S\u00edrio:\n  - Played: 18\n  - Drawn: 4\n  - Lost: 3\n- For Corinthians:\n  - Lost: 2\n\nThus, the claim is true.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{Yes}}$",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"aa s\u00e3o bento draw more game than paulistano\" is true or false based on the given table in JSON format. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The subject is \"aa s\u00e3o bento\" and they are said to have drawn more games than \"paulistano.\" So I need to compare the number of drawn games for both teams.\n\nLooking at the table structure: it has columns like position, team, points, played, drawn, lost, against, difference. The relevant column here is \"drawn,\" which tells us how many matches each team drew.\n\nNext, I need to find the rows where the team names match \"aa s\u00e3o bento\" and \"paulistano.\" Let me go through the data array:\n\n- Row 6: Team is \"ypiranga - sp\"\nWait, no. Let's index correctly starting from 0:\nRow indices are as follows:\n0: Corinthians\n1: Palestra It\u00e1lia - SP\n2: S\u00e3o Paulo?\nWait, let me look again.\n\nLooking at the data array:\n\n- Index 6 has team \"minas gerais\"\n- Wait, I think I miscounted. Let's list all teams with their row indices:\n\nRow 0: Corinthians (index 0)\nRow 1: Palestra It\u00e1lia - SP (index 1)\nRow 2: S\u00e3o Paulo? No, it says \"s\u00e9rio\" at index 2.\nWait, no, the third entry is \"s\\ \u00edrio\", which I think is a typo and should be \"S\u00e3o Paulo\"? Wait, maybe not. Let me check each team:\n\nLooking again:\n- Index 0: corinthians\n- Index 1: palestra it\u00e1lia - sp\n- Index 2: s\u00e9r io (maybe S\u00e3o Paulo FC? Or another team)\nWait, no, the third entry is \"s\\ \u00edrio\" which might be a different club. Let's see:\n\nRow indices and teams:\n0: Corinthians\n1: Palestra It\u00e1lia - SP\n2: S\u00e9r\u00edo (probably short for something else)\n3: Paulistano\n4: AA das Palmeiras\n5: Ypiranga - SP\n6: Minas Gerais\n7: AA S\u00e3o Bento\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the teams are:\n\nRow 0: Corinthians\nRow 1: Palestra It\u00e1lia\nRow 2: S\u00e9r\u00edo (maybe short for S\u00e3o Paulo)\nBut wait, the team at row index 7 is \"aa s\u00e3o bento.\" So \"AA S\u00e3o Bento\" is in row 7.\n\nAnd Paulistano is in row 3.\n\nSo now I can get their drawn games.\n\nLooking at column names, the fifth element is \"drawn,\" so that's the column we need. Let me confirm:\n\nColumns are: position, team, points, played, drawn, lost, against, difference. So index 4 is \"drawn.\"\n\nNow, for AA S\u00e3o Bento (row 7), their drawn games are in row 7, column 'drawn' which is the fifth element of that array.\n\nLooking at row 7's data: [13, \"aa s\\u00e3o bento\", 14, 18, 2, 10, 54, \"- 29\"]\n\nWait, no. Let me look again at the JSON structure:\n\nEach data entry is an array where:\n[1, \"corinthians\", 30, 18, 2, 2, 19, \"53\"]\nSo index 0: position\nindex 1: team\nindex 2: points\nindex 3: played\nindex 4: drawn\nindex 5: lost\nindex 6: against\nindex 7: difference\n\nSo for each row, the 'drawn' is at index 4.\n\nNow, find the rows for AA S\u00e3o Bento and Paulistano.\n\nLooking through the data array:\n\nRow 0: Corinthians\nRow 1: Palestra It\u00e1lia - SP\nRow 2: S\u00e9r\u00edo (team name is \"s\\ \u00edrio\" as per JSON)\nWait, actually, looking at the data:\n- Row index 3 is [\"paulistano\", ...], so team is paulistano.\n- Row index 7 is [\"aa s\\u00e3o bento\", ...], which decodes to \"AA S\u00e3o Bento\".\n\nSo for Paulistano (row 3), drawn games are at data[3][4]. Let's see:\n\nRow 3: [4, \"paulistano\", 22, 18, 2, 6, 34, \"17\"]\n\nSo drawn is 2.\n\nFor AA S\u00e3o Bento (row 7):\n\nRow 7: [8, \"aa s\\u00e3o bento\", 13, 18, 1, 11, 32, \"-7\"]\n\nWait, the data for row 7 is:\n[8, \"aa s\u00e3o bento\", 13, 18, 1, 11, 32, \"-7\"]\n\nSo their drawn games are at index 4: 1.\n\nNow, the claim says that AA S\u00e3o Bento drew more games than Paulistano. So we compare:\n\nAA S\u00e3o Bento's draws: 1\nPaulistano's draws: 2\n\nSo 1 is not more than 2; therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up the rows or columns.\n\nYes, Paulistano is row index 3. Drawn at index 4 is 2.\n\nAA S\u00e3o Bento is row index 7. Drawn is 1.\n\nSo 1 < 2, meaning AA S\u00e3o Bento drew fewer games than Paulistano. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"aa s\u00e3o bento\" drew more games than paulistano. However, aa s\u00e3o bento has 1 draw, while paulistano has 2 draws. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": \"FALSE\"\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine whether the claim \"mina gerais lost the most game in total\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll check the table structure. The columns are position, team, points, played, drawn, lost, against, and difference. So, each row represents a team's performance in a league or something similar.\n\nThe claim is about \"mina gerais.\" Looking at the data rows, I see that one of the teams is \"minas gerais\" (probably a typo for Mina Gerais). Let me find their row. It's the 7th row, index 6 since counting starts from 0.\n\nIn the team's row, under the \"lost\" column, which indicates the number of games lost, it says 10. So, they've lost 10 games.\n\nNow, I need to check if this is indeed the highest number of losses among all teams in the table. Let me go through each team:\n\n1. Corinthians: Lost 2\n2. Palestra It\u00e1lia - SP: Lost 3\n3. S\u00e3o Paulo (S\\ u00edrio): Lost 3\n4. Paulistano: Lost 6\n5. Palmeiras: Lost 7\n6. Ypiranga - SP: Lost 8\n7. Minas Gerais: Lost 10\n8. AA S\u00e3o Bento: Lost 11\n\nWait a minute, actually, looking back at the data:\n\nRow indices are from 0 to 7.\n\n- Row 0 (Corinthians): lost is 2\n- Row 1: Palestra It\u00e1lia - SP: lost 3\n- Row 2: S\\ u00edrio: lost 3\n- Row 3: Paulistano: lost 6\n- Row 4: AA das Palmeiras: lost 7\n- Row 5: Ypiranga - SP: lost 8\n- Row 6: Minas Gerais: lost 10\n- Row 7: AA S\u00e3o Bento: lost 11\n\nWait, so actually, the team at row 7 has 11 losses, which is more than Minas Gerais's 10. So, that would mean that the claim is FALSE because another team (AA S\u00e3o Bento) lost more games.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me double-check:\n\nRow indices and their 'lost' values:\n\n- 0: 2\n- 1:3\n- 2:3\n- 3:6\n- 4:7\n- 5:8\n- 6:10\n- 7:11\n\nYes, row 7 has the highest with 11 losses. So Minas Gerais lost 10, which is less than 11.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"minas gerais lost the most games in total\" is FALSE because another team (AA S\u00e3o Bento) lost more games.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread the 'lost' column for row 7. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the data array: \n\nThe last entry is [8,\"aa s\\ u00e3o bento\",13,18,1,11,32,\"-7\"]\n\nYes, lost is 11.\n\nSo Minas Gerais (row 6) has 10 losses, which is not the highest. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"minas gerais lost the most game in total.\" By examining the table, we find that minas gerais have 10 losses. However, another team, AA S\u00e3o Bento (row index 7), has 11 losses, which is more than minas gerais. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"paulistano lost as many games as s\u00edrio draw\" is true or false based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I'll parse the table to find the relevant data points for both paulistano and s\u00edrio.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Paulistano is in row 3 (index 3). The columns are position, team, points, played, drawn, lost, against, difference.\nSo, for paulistano:\n  - Drawn: 2\n  - Lost: 6\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake. The claim says \"lost as many games as s\u00edrio draw\". So I need the number of losses for paulistano and the number of draws for s\u00edrio.\n\nSo let me correct that:\n\nFor paulistano:\n- Team name is in row 3, column \"team\" which is paulistano.\nLooking at the columns, \"lost\" is the fifth element (index 4 if starting from 0). So paulistano's losses are 6.\n\nNow for s\u00edrio, which is in row 2. Their team is \"s\u00edrio\". Looking at their stats:\n- Drawn: column \"drawn\", which is the fourth element (index 3). S\u00edrio has drawn 4 games.\n\nThe claim states that paulistano lost as many games as s\u00edrio drew. So, comparing paulistano's losses (6) with s\u00edrio's draws (4). \n\nWait, that would mean 6 vs 4. They are not equal. So the claim is false because 6 does not equal 4.\n\nSo I should mark this as FALSE. The relevant cells are the \"lost\" column for paulistano and the \"drawn\" column for s\u00edrio.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\n- Paulistano's row index: 3 (since rows start at 0, but looking back, no\u2014row indexes in JSON data array start from 0. Wait, the first entry is position 1, team corinthians, etc., so each data array element corresponds to a row starting from index 0.\n\nWait, the table's data is an array of arrays:\n\nRow 0: corinthians\nRow 1: palestra it\u00e1lia - sp\nRow 2: s\u00edrio\nRow 3: paulistano\n... etc.\n\nSo for s\u00edrio, which is in row index 2:\n- team: s\u00edrio\n- drawn: column \"drawn\" is the fourth element (index 3) of their data array. Their data is [3, \"s\u00edrio\", 26, 18, 4, 3, 27, \"17\"]. So the 'drawn' value is 4.\n\nPaulistano is in row index 3:\n- team: paulistano\n- lost: column \"lost\" is the fifth element (index 4) of their data array. Their data is [4, \"paulistano\", 22, 18, 2, 6, 34, \"17\"]. So 'lost' is 6.\n\nSo claim says paulistano lost as many games as s\u00edrio drew: 6 vs 4 \u2192 not equal. Therefore, FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"lost\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"drawn\" }\n   ]\n}\n```",
