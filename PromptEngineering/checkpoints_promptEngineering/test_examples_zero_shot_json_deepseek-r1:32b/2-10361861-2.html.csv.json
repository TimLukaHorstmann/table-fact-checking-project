    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"week 2 have more attendance than week 1\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's comparing the attendance numbers of week 2 and week 1 to see if week 2 had a higher attendance.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are columns for \"week,\" \"date,\" \"opponent,\" \"result,\" and \"attendance.\" Each row represents a different week from 1 to 16. So, I need to find the rows corresponding to week 1 and week 2 and check their attendance figures.\n\nStarting with week 1: The first entry in the data array is for week 1. Its attendance is listed as 44773. \n\nNext, week 2's data is in the second row of the data array. The attendance there is 46460.\n\nNow, I need to compare these two numbers. Week 1 had 44,773 attendees, and week 2 had 46,460. Since 46,460 is greater than 44,773, the claim that week 2 had more attendance than week 1 holds true.\n\nTo make sure I'm not missing anything, I'll double-check the relevant cells in the table:\n\n- For week 1 (row index 0), the \"attendance\" column shows 44773.\n- For week 2 (row index 1), the \"attendance\" column shows 46460.\n\nThese are the only cells needed to verify the claim. No other rows or columns are relevant because the claim specifically refers to weeks 1 and 2, so I don't need to consider data from other weeks or different columns like opponent or result.\n\nTherefore, after careful examination, the claim is supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim compares the attendance of week 1 (44773) with week 2 (46460). Since 46460 > 44773, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that the highest attendance (crowd) was in week 4. So I need to look at the 'attendance' column for each week and see if week 4 indeed has the highest number.\n\nLooking at the table structure provided, it's a JSON with columns: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. The data is an array of arrays where each inner array represents a row in the table. So, to check the claim, I should go through each row, extract the 'attendance' value, and compare them all.\n\nLet me list out each week's attendance:\n\n1. Week 1: 44773\n2. Week 2: 46460\n3. Week 3: 59983\n4. Week 4: 80291\n5. Week 5: 47583\n6. Week 6: 46751\n7. Week 7: 44487\n8. Week 8: 56191\n9. Week 9: 52060\n10. Week 10: 46264\n11. Week 11: 46032\n12. Week 12: 47234\n13.

Scanning through these numbers, I see that week 4 has 80,291 attendees, which seems higher than all others. Let me double-check to make sure no other week exceeds this number.\n\nWeek 3 has 59,983, week 8 is 56,191, and week 14 jumps to 65,649. Comparing these, none of them surpass the 80k mark of week 4. So yes, week 4 does have the highest attendance.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"week 13 have the least number of crowd attend\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim refers to week 13 and mentions that it has the least attendance. So, I should look at the 'attendance' column for week 13 and compare it with all other weeks to see if it's indeed the smallest number.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different week. The columns are \"week\", \"date\", \"opponent\", \"result\", and \"attendance\". So, I'll focus on the 'attendance' values across all rows to find out which week had the lowest attendance.\n\nLet me list down the attendances for each week:\n\n- Week 1: 44773\n- Week 2: 46460\n- Week 3: 59983\n- Week 4: 80291\n- Week 5: 47583\n- Week 6: 46751\n- Week 7: 44487\n- Week 8: 56191\n- Week 9: 52060\n- Week 10: 46264\n- Week 11: 46032\n- Week 12: 47234\n- Week 13: 30936\n- Week 14: 65649\n- Week 15: 42202\n- Week 16: 51064\n\nNow, I'll identify the smallest number in this list. Scanning through them:\n\nThe attendance for week 7 is 44,487 which is lower than week 1's 44,773. Then week 13 has 30,936, which is even lower than week 7.\n\nWait a second, so the lowest attendance is actually in week 13 with 30,936 attendees. But I need to check if this is indeed the smallest across all weeks.\n\nLooking again:\n\nWeek 1: 44,773\nWeek 2: 46,460\nWeek 3: 59,983\nWeek 4: 80,291 (highest so far)\nWeek 5: 47,583\nWeek 6: 46,751\nWeek 7: 44,487\nWeek 8: 56,191\nWeek 9: 52,060\nWeek 10: 46,264\nWeek 11: 46,032\nWeek 12: 47,234\nWeek 13: 30,936 (this is the smallest so far)\nWeek 14: 65,649\nWeek 15: 42,202\nWeek 16: 51,064\n\nComparing all of these, week 13 has the lowest attendance at 30,936. So the claim that \"week 13 have the least number of crowd attend\" is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant for this conclusion. The key information comes from the 'attendance' column in each row, but specifically, we're interested in week 13's attendance and ensuring it's the smallest. However, since the claim is about week 13 having the least, we should also consider all other weeks to confirm that no other week has a lower attendance.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I only need to highlight the relevant cells used to verify the claim. Since the claim focuses on week 13, and its attendance being the lowest, the relevant cell is week 13's attendance value.\n\nSo, the row index for week 13 is 12 (since rows are zero-indexed; week 1 is index 0, so week 13 would be index 12). The column name is 'attendance'.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE with relevant_cells pointing to that specific cell.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The goal is to determine whether the claim \"week 9 have 5796 more crowd attend than week 10\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll need to understand the structure of the table. It has columns: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. The data consists of rows, each representing a week's game with details including the number of attendees.\n\nThe claim compares the attendance in week 9 and week 10, specifically stating that week 9 had 5796 more people attending than week 10. To verify this, I'll need to find the attendance numbers for both weeks from the table.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- For week 9: The row index is 8 (since indexing starts at 0). Under the 'attendance' column, it shows 52060.\n- For week 10: The row index is 9. The attendance here is 46264.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the difference between these two numbers to check if it's indeed 5796 more in week 9 than in week 10. \n\nSo, subtracting week 10's attendance from week 9's: \n52060 - 46264 = 5796.\n\nSince the calculation matches exactly what the claim states, it supports the claim being TRUE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells for this verification, I'll need to identify which cells were used.

That should be the second row in the data array. Looking at that, the attendance is listed as 46460. \n\nNow, comparing these two numbers: week 1 had 44,773 attendees, and week 2 had 46,460. The claim states that week 2 has less attendance than week 1. But wait, 46,460 is actually higher than 44,773. So the attendance for week 2 is more, not less.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because week 2's attendance was higher than week 1's. \n\nI should also note the relevant cells that were used to verify this.

Let me go through each row one by one:\n\n- Week 1: Attendance is 44,773\n- Week 2: 46,460\n- Week 3: 59,983\n- Week 4: 80,291\n- Week 5: 47,583\n- Week 6: 46,751\n- Week 7: 44,487\n- Week 8: 56,191\n- Week 9: 52,060\n- Week 10: 46,264\n- Week 11: 46,032\n- Week 12: 47,234\n- Week 13: 30,936\n- Week 14: 65,649\n- Week 15: 42,202\n- Week 16: 51,064\n\nLooking at these numbers, I can see that week 7 has an attendance of 44,487. But wait, when I scan through all the weeks, I notice that week 4 has a much higher number: 80,291. That's clearly the highest in the entire table.\n\nSo, if the claim is that the highest attendance was in week 7, but actually it's week 4 with over 80k, then the claim must be FALSE. Therefore, I need to identify all the rows where attendance occurred and compare them. The relevant cells here are each row's \"attendance\" column because we're checking all of them to find the maximum.\n\nThe highest number isn't in week 7 but in week 4, so the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

From the table, week 8's date is October 26, 1980 against the Green Bay Packers with a result of L 16-3 and an attendance of 56,191.\n\nNext, I need to find week 10. Week 10 was on November 9, 1980, against the Detroit Lions, resulting in a W 34-0, and had an attendance of 46,264.\n\nNow, subtracting week 10's attendance from week 8's: 56,191 minus 46,264 equals 9,927. The claim states that week 8 had 5,796 more attendees than week 10, but the actual difference is 9,927.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"week 13 have the most crowd attend\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim mentions two main things: week number and attendance. So, I'm looking for which week had the highest attendance. The claim says it was week 13. \n\nFirst, I'll check the structure of the table. It has columns: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. Each row corresponds to a different week from 1 to 16.\n\nI need to go through each row, specifically looking at the \"week\" and \"attendance\" columns. The goal is to find out which week had the highest attendance number.\n\nStarting with week 1: attendance was 44773.\nWeek 2: 46460. That's higher than week 1.\nWeek 3 jumps up to 59983, which is much higher.\nWeek 4 has an attendance of 80291, that's even higher than week 3.\nWeek 5 shows 47583, which drops a bit from week 4 but still lower than week 4.\nWeek 6: 46751. Lower again.\nWeek 7: 44487, continues the downward trend.\nWeek 8: 56191, a slight increase but not as high as week 4.\nWeek 9 has 52060, which is lower than week 8.\nWeek 10: 46264. Lower again.\nWeek 11: 46032, slightly higher than week 10 but still low.\nWeek 12: 47234, a bit more.\nWeek 13: 30936. That's lower than several weeks before, including week 8 and 9.\nWeek 14 has an attendance of 65649, which is higher than some weeks but not as high as week 4.\nWeek 15: 42202. Lower again.\nFinally, week 16: 51064.\n\nLooking at all these numbers, the highest attendance was in week 4 with 80291 people. Week 13 had only 30936 attendees, which is actually one of the lower attendances in the season. Therefore, the claim that week 13 had the most crowd attendance isn't correct.\n\nTo support this conclusion, I'll note the relevant cells: the \"attendance\" column for each week from 1 to 16, but especially comparing week 4 and week 13 since they're key points here.\n</think>\n\nThe highest attendance was in week 4 with 80291 attendees.
