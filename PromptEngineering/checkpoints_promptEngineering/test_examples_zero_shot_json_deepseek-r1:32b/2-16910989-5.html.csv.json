    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim about Kristofer Martin is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, the claim states two things:\n1. Kristofer Martin was nominated for 3 acting awards in 2012.\n2. He won the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award in 2012.\n\nI'll start by looking at the data from the table to see if these claims hold up.\n\nLooking at the \"year\" column, I'm focusing on entries where the year is 2012 since that's what the claim specifies. Let me list out all the 2012 entries:\n\n- Row 3: The Young Critics Circle Awards for Best Performance in Oros (Nominated)\n- Row 4: 28th PMPc Star Awards for Movies for New Movie Actor of the Year inTween Academy: Class of 2012 (Nominated)\n- Row 5: FAMAS Awards for German Moreno Youth Achievement Award (Won)\n- Row 6: 1st Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards for Most Liked Loveteam with Joyce Ching (Won)\n\nWait, that's four entries in total for 2012. But the claim mentions being nominated for three acting awards. So let me count how many nominations there are:\n\n- Row 3: Nominated\n- Row 4: Nominated\n\nThat's two nominations. The other two rows show wins but not nominations. So the first part of the claim says he was nominated for 3 awards, but according to the table, it's only two. This suggests that the first part might be incorrect.\n\nNow, checking the second part: winning the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award in 2012. Looking at Row 5, under FAMAS Awards, the category is \"german moreno youth achievement award\" and the result is \"won\". So this part of the claim is correct.\n\nHowever, the first part about being nominated for three acting awards isn't fully supported by the data\u2014it only shows two nominations. Therefore, since not all parts of the claim are true, the overall answer should be FALSE.\n\nTo summarize:\n- The claim has two main points.\n- One point (winning the award) is correct.\n- The other point (three nominations) isn't accurate as per the table; there are only two nominations.\nTherefore, the entire claim is not fully supported and must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"category\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about Kristofer Martin's awards in 2013 is true or false based on the provided table data. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states that in 2013, Kristofer received an honorable mention for best supporting actor in \"oros\" at the 16th Long Island International Film Expo, but he won best actor in a supporting role for \"oros\" at the 10th Golden Screen Award.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each part of this claim. The table has multiple entries, so I'll go through each row that pertains to the year 2013 since that's what the claim is about.\n\nLet me start by identifying all the rows from 2013. In the data array:\n\n- Row 0: 2013, \"1st sunday all stars awards\", \"stand out season performer\", \"none\", \"nominated\"\n- Row 1: 2013, \"16th long island international film expo\", \"honorable mention for best supporting actor\", \"oros\", \"won\"\n- Row 2: 2013, \"10th golden screen awards\", \"best actor in a supporting role\", \"oros\", \"won\"\n\nSo rows 1 and 2 are relevant because they are from 2013 and relate to the specific awards mentioned.\n\nNow, checking row 1: The award giving body is \"16th long island international film expo,\" the category is \"honorable mention for best supporting actor,\" the nomination is for \"oros,\" and the result was \"won.\" Wait a second, the claim says he received an honorable mention. But in the table, the result column shows \"won.\" That seems contradictory because an honorable mention is typically not the same as winning.\n\nNext, row 2: The award giving body is \"10th golden screen awards,\" category \"best actor in a supporting role,\" nomination for \"oros,\" and the result is \"won.\" This part aligns with the claim\u2014he won best actor in a supporting role at this award.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\n- At the 16th Long Island International Film Expo, he supposedly received an honorable mention. However, according to the table, he actually won that category.\n- At the 10th Golden Screen Awards, he indeed won for best supporting actor in \"oros,\" which matches the claim.\n\nThe discrepancy is about whether he won or just received an honorable mention at the first award. Since the table says he won, but the claim states it was an honorable mention, this makes the overall claim false because part of it isn't accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Kristofer only received an honorable mention at the 16th Long Island International Film Expo when in fact he won. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"award giving body\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"award giving body\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"3 of kristofer martin's award nominations were for his performance in 'oros'\". \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the table means. Each row represents an award nomination or win. The columns are year, award giving body, category, nominated for, and result.\n\nI need to check how many times \"oros\" appears under the \"nominated for\" column because that's where the show or movie name would be mentioned if it's related to a performance in 'Oros'. \n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: 2013, 1st sunday all stars awards, stand out season performer, none, nominated. The \"nominated for\" is \"none\", so not relevant.\n2. Row 1: 2013, 16th long island international film expo, honorable mention for best supporting actor, oros, won. Here, \"oros\" is mentioned. So this counts as one nomination related to 'Oros'.\n3. Row 2: 2013, 10th golden screen awards, best actor in a supporting role, oros, won. Again, \"oros\" here. That's the second nomination.\n4. Row 3: 2012, the young critics circle awards, best performance, oros, nominated. Another one with 'Oros'. Now that's three nominations related to 'Oros'.\n5. Rows 4-6: The \"nominated for\" entries don't mention 'Oros', so they don't count towards this claim.\n\nSo in total, there are three rows where the nomination is specifically for 'Oros' (rows 1, 2, and 3). Therefore, the claim that 3 of his nominations were for 'Oros' is true. \n\nI need to list these relevant cells as well. Each row has \"nominated for\" column which is important here. So the rows are index 0 (no), 1 (yes), 2 (yes), 3 (yes), and the rest no.\n\nSo compiling that, the answer should be TRUE with those three rows.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Kristofer Martin had three award nominations for his performance in \"oros\". By examining each row, we find that three entries list \"oros\" under the \"nominated for\" column. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says he has been nominated for 7 acting awards between 2012 and 2013 and won 4 of them. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table to see how many nominations and wins there are for each year. \n\nStarting with 2013:\n- Row 0: Nominated for \"stand out season performer\" - result is \"nominated\".\n- Row 1: Won \"honorable mention for best supporting actor\" for \"oros\".\n- Row 2: Won \"best actor in a supporting role\" for \"oros\".\n\nSo in 2013, he has 1 nomination and 2 wins.\n\nMoving on to 2012:\n- Row 3: Nominated for \"best performance\" in \"oros\".\n- Row 4: Nominated for \"new movie actor of the year\" in \"tween academy : class of 2012\".\n- Row 5: Won \"german moreno youth achievement award\" at FAMAS awards.\n- Row 6: Won \"most liked loveteam with joyce ching\" at \"1st party pilipinas most liked awards\".\n\nIn 2012, that's 2 nominations and 2 wins.\n\nAdding them up:\nNominations: 1 (2013) + 2 (2012) = 3.\nWins: 2 (2013) + 2 (2012) = 4.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't add up to 7 nominations. The claim says he was nominated for 7 awards between 2012 and 2013, but according to the table, there are only 3 nominations total across both years. He did win 4 awards as stated, but the number of nominations is incorrect.\n\nLooking back at each row:\n- Rows 0: nomination\n- Row 1: won\n- Row 2: won\n- Row 3: nomination\n- Row 4: nomination\n- Row 5: won\n- Row 6: won\n\nSo total nominations are rows 0,3,4 \u2013 that's 3. Wins are rows 1,2,5,6 \u2013 that's 4.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it states he was nominated for 7 awards when actually there are only 3 in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"2 of the award wins by Kristofer Martin between 2012 and 2013 were not based on nomination for a specific show.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what this means. The claim is about two awards that Kristofer won where the nominations weren't for any particular show. In other words, the \"nominated for\" column should be something like 'none' or 'n/a', indicating it wasn't tied to a specific program or series.\n\nLooking at the table data:\n\n1. **Row 0 (2013):** Award from 1st Sunday All Stars Awards, category Stand Out Season Performer, nominated for \"none\", result is \"nominated\". Since he was only nominated and didn't win, this row doesn't contribute to his wins.\n\n2. **Row 1 (2013):** Won Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor at the 16th Long Island International Film Expo, nominated for \"oros\". So, it's based on a specific show (\"oros\"), which means this doesn't fit the claim condition.\n\n3. **Row 2 (2013):** Won Best Actor in a Supporting Role at the 10th Golden Screen Awards, also for \"oros\". Again, tied to a specific show, so not relevant for the claim.\n\n4. **Row 3 (2012):** Nominated for Best Performance at The Young Critics Circle Awards, nominated for \"oros\", result is \"nominated\". Not a win, so it doesn't count towards the two wins required by the claim.\n\n5. **Row 4 (2012):** Nominated for New Movie Actor of the Year at 28th PMPc Star Awards for Movies, nominated for \"tween academy : class of 2012\". Result is \"nominated\", so not a win either.\n\n6. **Row 5 (2012):** Won the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award at FAMAS Awards, nominated for \"n/a\". This means there was no specific show involved; it's based on his overall work or achievement without a particular nomination for a series. So this counts as one award that fits the condition.\n\n7. **Row 6 (2012):** Won Most Liked Loveteam with Joyce Ching at 1st Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards, nominated for \"n/a\". Again, no specific show involved; it's based on public liking or general performance. This is the second award that fits the condition.\n\nSo, rows 5 and 6 are the two wins where he wasn't nominated for a specific show. Each of these has \"result\" as \"won\" and \"nominated for\" as either 'n/a' or not tied to a particular series. \n\nThus, the claim is TRUE because there are exactly two award wins (rows 5 and 6) that do not have a specific show nomination.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

He won 4 of those awards.\n\nLooking at the table data:\n\nThe columns we're concerned with are \"year\", \"category\", and \"result\".\n\nI'll go through each row to see which ones are relevant.\n\nRow 0: 2013, \"stand out season performer\" nomination \u2013 this isn't a Best Actor category. So not relevant.\nRow 1: 2013, \"honorable mention for best supporting actor\", result is \"won\". This is related to acting but it's a supporting role, not Best Actor. But since it's an award, maybe count towards the total?\nRow 2: 2013, \"best actor in a supporting role\" \u2013 again, supporting, so not exactly Best Actor.\nRow 3: 2012, \"best performance\", which is from \"the young critics circle awards\". This could be considered as a Best Actor category. Result is nominated.\nRow 4: 2012, \"new movie actor of the year\" \u2013 this is more about new actors, not necessarily Best Actor. Result is nominated.\nRow 5: 2012, \"german moreno youth achievement award\" \u2013 seems like a specific award, not directly Best Actor. Result is won.\nRow 6: 2012, \"most liked loveteam with joyce ching\" \u2013 this is about popularity, not acting performance. Result is won.\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"best actor awards\", so perhaps I should only consider categories that specifically mention \"Best Actor\".\n\nLooking again:\n- Row 3's category is \"best performance\". Maybe that counts as a Best Actor award.\n- Rows 1 and 2 are for supporting roles or honorable mentions, not exactly Best Actor.\n\nSo let me list the relevant rows where the category could be considered a Best Actor award:\n\nRow 3: 2012, \"best performance\" \u2013 maybe counts. Nominated.\nAny others? Let's see:\n- Rows 1 and 2 are supporting roles.\n- Row 5 is youth achievement, not exactly acting in a lead role.\n\nSo only row 3 might count as a Best Actor nomination. That gives just one nomination, but the claim says 7. So this doesn't add up.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm being too restrictive. Maybe any acting-related award counts towards \"Best Actor awards\", including supporting roles and other categories. Let me reevaluate.\n\nIf that's the case, then let's count all the rows where the category is related to acting:\n\nRow 0: nomination for \"stand out season performer\" \u2013 perhaps an acting category.\nRow 1: won in \"honorable mention for best supporting actor\".\nRow 2: won in \"best actor in a supporting role\".\nRow 3: nominated for \"best performance\".\nRows 4-6 are not directly acting awards, so probably exclude.\n\nSo that's rows 0 (nomination), 1 (win), 2 (win), and 3 (nomination). That gives 4 nominations and 2 wins. But the claim says 7 nominations and 4 wins. So still doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing some. Let me count again:\n\nLooking at all rows from 2012 and 2013:\n\nRow 0: 2013, \"stand out season performer\" \u2013 nomination.\nRow 1: 2013, supporting actor \u2013 won.\nRow 2: 2013, best supporting actor \u2013 won.\nRow 3: 2012, best performance \u2013 nominated.\nRows 4-6 are other awards not directly acting.\n\nSo in total, rows 0,1,2,3 have acting-related entries. That's four entries: two nominations (rows 0 and 3) and two wins (rows 1 and 2). So that's four awards total, with 2 wins.\n\nBut the claim says 7 nominations and 4 wins. This is way off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm considering too narrowly. Perhaps all the awards are considered \"actor\" awards regardless of category. Let me check:\n\nRows from 2012-2013:\n\nRow 0: nomination.\nRow 1: win.\nRow 2: win.\nRow 3: nomination.\nRow 4: nomination (but for new actor, not necessarily best actor).\nRow 5: won (youth award).\nRow 6: won.\n\nSo total awards: rows 0-6 except maybe row 4 if it's not acting. So that's 7 awards:\n\nRows 0 (nom),1(win),2(win),3(nom),4(nom),5(win),6(win).\n\nThat would be 4 nominations and 3 wins, but the claim says 7 nominations and 4 wins.\n\nWait, let me count again:\n\nRow 0: nom\nRow 1: win\nRow 2: win\nRow 3: nom\nRow 4: nom (new actor)\nRow 5: win\nRow 6: win\n\nTotal: 3 nominations (rows 0,3,4) and 4 wins (rows1,2,5,6). So that would be 7 awards in total.\n\nSo if the claim is that he was nominated for 7 Best Actor awards and won 4, but according to this, he has 3 nominations and 4 wins. But the claim says he was nominated for 7 and won 4.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the counts. The table shows:\n\nBetween 2012-2013, how many times was he nominated? Let's see:\n\nRow 0: nom\nRow 3: nom\nRow 4: nom\n\nThat's three nominations.\n\nAnd wins:\n\nRow1,2,5,6 \u2013 four wins.\n\nSo total awards (nom + win): 7. But the claim says \"nominated for 7 best actor award\", which would mean 7 nominations, but he only has 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is miscounting. Or maybe all the awards are considered as acting-related, so 7 in total: 3 nominations and 4 wins.\n\nBut the wording of the claim is \"nominated for 7 best actor awards\" \u2013 meaning 7 times nominated. But he was only nominated three times.\n\nSo there's a discrepancy here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some of these are multiple awards within the same year or category, but it seems each row is a separate award.\n\nTherefore, the claim that he was nominated seven times and won four doesn't align with the data provided.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount:\n\nTotal nominations in 2012-2013:\n\nRow0: nomination\nRow3: nomination\nRow4: nomination\n\nThat's three.\n\nWins:\n\nRow1: win\nRow2: win\nRow5: win\nRow6: win\n\nFour wins.\n\nSo total awards: seven (three nom, four wins). But the claim says \"nominated for 7 best actor awards\" and won four. So perhaps the user is considering all the awards as Best Actor nominations, but that's not accurate because some are supporting roles or other categories.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the data.\n\nLooking back at the categories:\n\nRow0: \"stand out season performer\"\nRow1: \"best supporting actor\"\nRow2: \"best actor in a supporting role\" (same as Row1)\nRow3: \"best performance\"\n\nRows 4-6 are not acting awards.\n\nSo Rows 0,1,2,3 could be considered acting-related. So that's four awards:\n\nNominations: rows 0 and 3 \u2013 two nominations.\nWins: rows 1 and 2 \u2013 two wins.\n\nThat makes four awards total (two nom, two win).\n\nBut the claim says seven nominations and four wins, which doesn't match.\n\nI think I need to clarify. The data provided shows that between 2012-2013, he was nominated three times (rows 0,3,4) and won four times (rows1,2,5,6). So if the claim is about all acting-related awards, it's seven in total, but with only three nominations.\n\nBut the user says \"nominated for 7 best actor awards\", which doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me list each award:\n\n2013:\n- Row0: nomination (stand out performer)\n- Row1: win (supporting actor)\n- Row2: win (supporting actor)\n\n2012:\n- Row3: nomination (best performance)\n- Row4: nomination (new actor)\n- Row5: win (youth award)\n- Row6: win (popularity)\n\nSo total nominations: rows 0,3,4 \u2013 three.\nWins: rows1,2,5,6 \u2013 four.\n\nSo the claim says \"nominated for seven best actor awards and won four\". But according to this, it's three nominations and four wins. So the user is incorrect in their claim.\n\nTherefore, based on the data, he was not nominated seven times but three times, and won four times.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided data:\n\n- **Nominations**: 3 (2013: stand out performer; 2012: best performance, new actor)\n- **Wins**: 4 (2013: best supporting actor twice; 2012: youth award and popularity)\n\nThe claim that he was nominated seven times for Best Actor awards is incorrect. The accurate count from the data shows three nominations and four wins.\n\n**Answer:**  \nHe was nominated for three acting-related awards and won four awards between 2012 and 2013.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"all of the award wins by Kristofer Martin between 2012 and 2013 be based on nomination for a specific show\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, I'm looking at the time frame: 2012 to 2013. The table has data from both years, so that's good. Now, the awards won are listed in the \"result\" column as either \"won\" or \"nominated\". So I should focus on the rows where the result is \"won\".\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: 2013, 1st sunday all stars awards, stand out season performer, none, nominated. Result is 'nominated', so not a win.\n\nRow 1: 2013, 16th long island international film expo, honorable mention for best supporting actor, oros, won. This is a win.\n\nRow 2: 2013, 10th golden screen awards, best actor in a supporting role, oros, won. Another win.\n\nRow 3: 2012, the young critics circle awards, best performance, oros, nominated. Not a win.\n\nRow 4: 2012, 28th pmpc star awards for movies, new movie actor of the year, tween academy : class of 2012, nominated. Not a win.\n\nRow 5: 2012, famas awards, german moreno youth achievement award, n/a, won. This is a win.\n\nRow 6: 2012, 1st party pilipinas most liked awards, most liked loveteam with joyce ching, n/a, won. Another win.\n\nSo the wins are in rows 1, 2, 5, and 6.\n\nThe claim says that all these wins were based on a nomination for a specific show. So I need to check each winning row's \"nominated for\" column to see if it's not \"none\" or \"n/a\". \n\nLooking at the \"nominated for\" column:\n\nRow 1: \"oros\"\nRow 2: \"oros\"\nRow 5: \"n/a\"\nRow 6: \"n/a\"\n\nRows 5 and 6 have \"n/a\", which I think means there wasn't a specific show they were nominated for. They might have won an award that's not tied to a particular show or role, perhaps a general achievement award.\n\nSo since some of the wins (rows 5 and 6) are not based on a nomination for a specific show, the claim isn't entirely true. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"all of kristofer martin's award nominations be for his performance in oros\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the table structure. The columns are year, award giving body, category, nominated for, and result. There are seven rows of data here, each representing an award nomination or win.\n\nThe claim says that all of Kristofer Martin's nominations were for his performance in \"Oros.\" So I need to check each row where the result is \"nominated\" and see if the \"nominated for\" column always mentions \"oros.\"\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Year 2013, award body \"1st sunday all stars awards,\" category \"stand out season performer,\" nominated for \"none,\" result \"nominated.\" So here, it's not for \"Oros\" because the \"nominated for\" is none. This might be a red flag already.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if Kristofer Martin was actually involved in all these awards. The claim specifies his nominations, so I'm assuming all these entries are about him.\n\nBut looking at row 0: the nominated for is \"none.\" That doesn't seem to align with \"Oros.\" So this could be a case where he was nominated but not for Oros. Therefore, if even one nomination isn't for Oros, the claim is false.\n\nLet me check other rows just in case:\n\n2. Row 1: 2013, \"16th long island international film expo,\" category \"honorable mention for best supporting actor,\" nominated for \"oros,\" result \"won.\" So here it's for Oros.\n\n3. Row 2: 2013, \"10th golden screen awards,\" category \"best actor in a supporting role,\" nominated for \"oros,\" result \"won.\" Again, for Oros.\n\n4. Row 3: 2012, \"the young critics circle awards,\" category \"best performance,\" nominated for \"oros,\" result \"nominated.\" So this is another nomination for Oros.\n\n5. Row 4: 2012, \"28th pmpc star awards for movies,\" category \"new movie actor of the year,\" nominated for \"tween academy : class of 2012,\" result \"nominated.\" Here, he was nominated for a different project, \"tween academy,\" not Oros.\n\n6. Row 5: 2012, \"famas awards,\" category \"german moreno youth achievement award,\" nominated for \"n/a,\" result \"won.\" So this is a bit unclear because the nominated for is \"n/a,\" which might mean it's not related to acting in a specific film.\n\n7. Row 6: 2012, \"1st party pilipinas most liked awards,\" category \"most liked loveteam with joyce ching,\" nominated for \"n/a,\" result \"won.\" Again, this seems more like a popularity award rather than an acting nomination, and not related to Oros.\n\nSo, from the above analysis:\n\n- Row 0: Nominated for none \u2192 Not Oros.\n- Rows 1,2,3: Nominated for Oros \u2192 Correct.\n- Row4: Nominated for tween academy \u2192 Different project.\n- Rows5,6: Nominated for n/a or something else \u2192 Not Oros.\n\nSo there are multiple instances where the nominations were not for Oros. Therefore, the claim that \"all of Kristofer Martin's award nominations be for his performance in oros\" is false because some nominations are for other projects or categories unrelated to Oros.\n\nI should also note the relevant cells that I checked. For each row, I looked at the \"nominated for\" column and the \"result\" column to see if it was a nomination for Oros. So the relevant cells would be from rows 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 in the columns \"nominated for\" and \"result.\"\n\nWait, but according to the instructions, I need to list each relevant cell as an object with row index and column name. Since I checked all rows, that's a lot of cells. Alternatively, maybe only some are directly relevant.\n\nLooking back: The claim is about nominations (where result is 'nominated') for Oros. So I should look at all rows where the result is 'nominated' and see if they were all for Oros.\n\nSo let me filter to only those rows where \"result\" is \"nominated\":\n\nRows with result \"nominated\":\n- Row0: 2013, Sunday All Stars Awards \u2192 nominated for none\n- Row3: 2012, Young Critics Circle Awards \u2192 nominated for oros\n- Row4: 2012, PMPc Star Awards \u2192 nominated for tween academy\n\nSo three nominations in total. Out of these, two are not for Oros (Row0 and Row4). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells would be the \"nominated for\" column in rows where result is 'nominated.' So row indices 0,3,4, with column name \"nominated for.\"\n\nAdditionally, maybe including the \"result\" column to confirm if it's a nomination. But perhaps focusing on the \"nominated for\" and \"result\" columns.\n\nSo compiling the relevant cells:\n\n- For each nomination (rows where result is 'nominated'), we check the \"nominated for.\" So row0: column 'nominated for' and 'result'; row3 same; row4 same.\n\nBut in the answer, perhaps just list all the relevant cells that were checked, which includes every row's 'nominated for' and 'result.' But to be precise, since we're only concerned with nominations (rows where result is 'nominated'), then rows0,3,4. So their \"nominated for\" columns are key.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because not all nominations were for Oros.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
