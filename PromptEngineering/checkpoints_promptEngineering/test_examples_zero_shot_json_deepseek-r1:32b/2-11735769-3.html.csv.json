    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"icarly be nominate for more award than the show win\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the subject is \"icarly.\" The claim states that icarly was nominated for more awards than it won. So I need to count how many times icarly was nominated and how many times it actually won awards from the given data.\n\nLooking at the table's columns: year, award, category, work, result. The \"work\" column is where the show name appears. For each row where the work is \"icarly,\" I should check the \"result\" to see if it was nominated or won.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0 (2009): Award is teen choice awards, category is choice tv actor : comedy, result is nominated.\n   - Work: icarly \u2192 count as a nomination.\n\n2. Row 1 (2010): Award is australian kids' choice awards, category big kid award, result nominated.\n   - Work: icarly \u2192 another nomination.\n\n3. Row 2 (2010): Same award, different category (lol award), result won.\n   - Work: icarly \u2192 this counts as a win.\n\n4. Row 3 (2011): uk kids' choice awards, funniest person, result won.\n   - Work: icarly \u2192 another win.\n\n5. Row 4 (2011): meus pr\u00eamios nick brazil, funniest character, result nominated.\n   - Work: icarly \u2192 nomination.\n\n6. Row 5 (2012): kids' choice awards, favorite tv sidekick, result nominated.\n   - Work: icarly \u2192 another nomination.\n\n7. Row 6 (2013): daytime emmy awards, category is about animated program, work is tuff puppy, which is different from icarly. So this row doesn't count towards our claim since the work isn't icarly.\n\nSo compiling the counts:\n- Nominations: Rows 0,1,4,5 \u2192 that's 4 nominations.\n- Wins: Rows 2,3 \u2192 that's 2 wins.\n\nNow, comparing the numbers: 4 nominations vs. 2 wins. The claim is that icarly was nominated for more awards than it won. Since 4 > 2, this seems to hold true.\n\nWait, let me double-check each row to make sure I didn't miss anything. Rows with work \"icarly\" are from 0 to 5 except row 6, which is tuff puppy. So rows 0: nominated, 1: nominated, 2: won, 3: won, 4: nominated, 5: nominated. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be all rows where work is icarly and result is either nominated or won. That includes rows 0,1,2,3,4,5 in the \"result\" column.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"icarly was nominated for more awards than it won.\" By examining each relevant cell, we find that icarly received 4 nominations and 2 wins. Thus, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"tuff be the only other show nominate aside from icarly\". Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim is saying. It's stating that \"Tuff\" is the only other show besides \"iCarly\" that was nominated. So, I need to check two things: \n\n1. Are there any shows other than \"iCarly\" that have been nominated?\n2. Is \"Tuff\" the only one?\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a nomination or win. The relevant columns are \"work\", which tells me the show's name, and \"result\", which shows if it was nominated or won.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Work is \"iCarly\", result is \"nominated\".\n- Row 1: Work is \"iCarly\", result is \"nominated\".\n- Row 2: Work is \"iCarly\", result is \"won\".\n- Row 3: Work is \"iCarly\", result is \"won\".\n- Row 4: Work is \"iCarly\", result is \"nominated\".\n- Row 5: Work is \"iCarly\", result is \"nominated\".\n- Row 6: Work is \"tuff puppy\", result is \"nominated\".\n\nSo, the only other show besides \"iCarly\" that was nominated is \"Tuff Puppy\". Let me check if there are any others. From rows 0 to 5, it's all \"iCarly\". The last row has \"Tuff Puppy\". So yes, \"Tuff Puppy\" is the only other show with a nomination.\n\nWait, but what about the spelling? The claim says \"tuff be...\" and in the table it's \"tuff puppy\". Is that considered the same? Since the claim refers to \"tuff\", I think they're talking about \"Tuff Puppy\", so that's acceptable. \n\nAre there any other shows besides these two? Looking through all rows, no. So yes, \"Tuff\" is the only other show aside from \"iCarly\" that was nominated.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that \"tuff puppy\" is the only other work besides \"icarly\" that received a nomination.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim about Jerry Trainor's nominations and wins is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"jerry traino be nominate for 2 award in 2010 and 2 award in 2011 win only 1 in each year.\"\n\nSo, the key points are:\n- In 2010, Jerry was nominated for 2 awards.\n- In 2011, he was also nominated for 2 awards.\n- He won 1 award each of those years.\n\nNow, looking at the table. The columns are \"year\", \"award\", \"category\", \"work\", and \"result\". Each row represents an award nomination or win.\n\nI'll go through each year mentioned in the claim: 2010 and 2011.\n\nStarting with 2010:\n- Rows 1 and 2 both have the year 2010.\n- Row 1: Award is \"2010 australian kids' choice awards\", category \"big kid award\", result \"nominated\".\n- Row 2: Same award, different category \"lol award (shared with ensemble)\", result \"won\".\n\nSo in 2010, there are two entries. Both are for the same award but different categories. One is nominated, and one is won.\n\nNext, checking 2011:\n- Rows 3 and 4 have year 2011.\n- Row 3: Award \"2011 uk kids' choice awards\", category \"nick uk's funniest person\", result \"won\".\n- Row 4: Award \"meus pr\u00eamios nick brazil\", category \"funniest character\", result \"nominated\".\n\nSo in 2011, there are two entries as well. One was won and one was nominated.\n\nNow, verifying the claim:\n- In 2010, Jerry was nominated for 2 awards? Well, he has two nominations in 2010: one where he was nominated (row 1) and another where he won (row 2). Wait, but the result column shows \"nominated\" only once. So actually, in 2010, he had one nomination and one win.\n\nWait a minute, that's different from what I thought earlier. Let me recount:\n\nIn 2010:\n- Row 1: Nominated\n- Row 2: Won\n\nSo that's two awards but only one nomination. Therefore, the claim says he was nominated for 2 awards in 2010, which isn't correct because according to the table, he was nominated once and won another.\n\nSimilarly, in 2011:\n- Row 3: Won\n- Row 4: Nominated\n\nAgain, only one nomination and one win. So the claim says he was nominated twice each year and won once each year. But the table shows that in both years, he had one nomination and one win.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it states two nominations per year when there's only one each.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again:\n\nIn 2010:\n- The award names are different? No, they're both from \"2010 australian kids' choice awards\" but different categories.\nSo two separate award categories in the same event. So perhaps he was nominated for two awards (categories) in 2010.\n\nSimilarly, in 2011, two different awards: one UK and one Brazil.\n\nBut looking at the results:\nIn 2010, he was \"nominated\" once (row 1) and \"won\" another (row 2). So total of two awards, but only one nomination. The other was a win.\n\nSimilarly, in 2011: he won one (row3) and nominated for another (row4).\n\nSo the claim says he was nominated twice each year and won once. But according to the table, in both years, he had one nomination and one win. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states two nominations each year when there's only one.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting \"nominated for 2 awards\". If he was nominated twice (two separate categories), that would count as two nominations. Let me see:\n\nIn 2010:\n- Nominated in category \"big kid award\" (row1)\n- Won \"lol award\" (row2)\n\nSo he was nominated once, and won another. So total of one nomination.\n\nSimilarly, in 2011:\n- Won in UK (row3)\n- Nominated in Brazil (row4)\nAgain, only one nomination each year.\n\nTherefore, the claim says he was nominated for two awards each year, but the table shows only one nomination each year. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Scanning through each row:\n\n1. The first entry is from 2009, Teen Choice Awards, category \"Choice TV Actor: Comedy,\" work \"iCarly,\" result \"nominated.\" This doesn't match either of the awards mentioned in the claim.\n\n2. The second entry is from 2010, Australian Kids' Choice Awards, category \"Big Kid Award,\" work \"iCarly,\" result \"nominated.\" Again, not matching the awards in question.\n\n3. The third row: 2010, same award show as above, category \"lol award (shared with ensemble),\" work \"iCarly,\" result \"won.\" This matches one part of the claim. So that's a win for Jerry Traino here.\n\n4. Fourth entry is from 2011, UK Kids' Choice Awards, category \"nick uk's funniest person,\" work \"iCarly,\" result \"won.\" This also matches the second award mentioned in the claim. So another win here.\n\n5. The fifth row: 2011, Meus Pr\u00eamios Nick Brazil, category \"funniest character,\" work \"iCarly,\" result \"nominated.\" Doesn't relate to the awards in the claim.\n\n6.

It says that iCarly was nominated 10 times as many awards as it won. So, I need to count how many nominations and wins there are in total for iCarly from the data given.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an award entry for iCarly. The columns include year, award name, category, work (which is \"icarly\" in all cases), and result. The result can be either \"nominated\" or \"won\".\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: 2009 Teen Choice Awards - Category: Choice TV Actor: Comedy. Result: Nominated.\n   - So, this is a nomination.\n\n2. Row 1: 2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards - Big Kid Award. Result: Nominated.\n   - Another nomination.\n\n3. Row 2: Same award as row 1 but different category. Result: Won.\n   - This counts as a win.\n\n4. Row 3: 2011 UK Kids' Choice Awards - Funniest Person. Result: Won.\n   - Another win.\n\n5. Row 4: Meus Pr\u00eamios Nick Brazil - Funniest Character. Result: Nominated.\n   - Nomination again.\n\n6. Row 5: 2012 Kids' Choice Awards - Favorite TV Sidekick. Result: Nominated.\n   - Nomination.\n\n7. Row 6: 2013 Daytime Emmy Awards - Outstanding Performer in Animated Program. Work is \"Tuff Puppy\". So, this isn't iCarly; it's a different work. Therefore, we can ignore this row as per the claim which is about iCarly only.\n\nNow, let's count:\n\nTotal nominations for iCarly: Rows 0,1,4,5 \u2192 4 nominations.\nWins: Rows 2 and 3 \u2192 2 wins.\n\nThe claim states that iCarly was nominated 10 times as many awards as it won. That would mean the number of nominations should be 10 times the number of wins.\n\nCalculating: If wins are W, then nominations N = 10*W.\nFrom our count: W=2 \u2192 N should be 20. But in reality, N=4.\n\nSo 4 \u2260 20. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are all rows where work is \"icarly\" and result is either nominated or won.

The goal is to determine whether the claim \"tuff be the only show nominate\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like there might be a typo, and it should probably read \"Tuff be the only show nominated.\" So, the claim is asserting that \"Tuff\" was the sole show that received a nomination. \n\nNow, looking at the table provided, each row contains information about various awards and nominations across different years. The columns are \"year,\" \"award,\" \"category,\" \"work,\" and \"result.\"\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to check two things:\n1. Are there any instances where \"Tuff\" was nominated?\n2. Is it the only show that received a nomination?\n\nStarting with the first point, I'll go through each row in the data array:\n\n- Row 0: The work is \"icarly,\" result is \"nominated.\"\n- Row 1: Work is \"icarly,\" result \"nominated.\"\n- Row 2: Work is \"icarly,\" result \"won.\"\n- Row 3: Work is \"icarly,\" result \"won.\"\n- Row 4: Work is \"icarly,\" result \"nominated.\"\n- Row 5: Work is \"icarly,\" result \"nominated.\"\n- Row 6: Work is \"tuff puppy,\" result \"nominated.\"\n\nSo, I see that in row 6, \"Tuff Puppy\" was nominated.

Looking back at all the rows, every other entry has \"icarly\" as the work with results including \"nominated.\" For example:\n- Rows 0,1,4,5 all have \"icarly\" and result \"nominated.\"\n- Rows 2 and 3 have \"icarly\" but with a result of \"won,\" which still indicates participation in the award process.\n\nTherefore, \"icarly\" was nominated multiple times across different years and categories. This means that while \"Tuff Puppy\" did receive one nomination, it wasn't the only show to be nominated\u2014multiple entries for \"icarly\" were also nominated.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is FALSE because \"Tuff\" isn't the only show that was nominated; \"icarly\" received multiple nominations as well.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"jerry traino be nominate for 2 award in 2010 and 2 award in 2011 win both in each year.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into parts:\n\n1. In 2010, Jerry Traino was nominated for 2 awards.\n2. In 2011, he was also nominated for 2 awards.\n3. He won both awards in each of those years.\n\nNow, looking at the table data to see if this holds true.\n\nLooking at the year 2010 first:\n\n- The table has two entries for 2010:\n   - Row index 1: Award is \"2010 australian kids' choice awards\", category is \"big kid award\", work is \"icarly\", result is \"nominated\".\n   - Row index 2: Same year and award, different category \"lol award (shared with ensemble)\", same work, but the result here is \"won\".\n\nSo in 2010, there are two awards related to Jerry Traino. The first was a nomination, and the second was a win. So that's one nomination and one win. But the claim says he was nominated for 2 awards in 2010. However, according to the table, only one of them was a nomination; the other was a win. Therefore, it seems like he wasn't nominated for two awards but rather received one nomination and one win.\n\nNext, looking at 2011:\n\n- The table has two entries:\n   - Row index 3: Award is \"2011 uk kids' choice awards\", category \"nick uk 's funniest person\", work \"icarly\", result \"won\".\n   - Row index 4: Award is \"meus pr\u00eamios nick brazil\", category \"funniest character\", work \"icarly\", result \"nominated\".\n\nSo in 2011, he has one win and one nomination as well. The claim states that he was nominated for two awards each year (2010 and 2011) and won both in each year. However, according to the table, in 2010, he had one nomination and one win; similarly, in 2011, also one of each. So it's not that he was nominated for two awards each year but rather that he had one nomination and one win each year.\n\nMoreover, the claim mentions \"win both in each year.\" But since he only won one award each year (in 2010, one win; same in 2011), it's incorrect to say he won both each year. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the data.\n\nSo putting it all together, the claim is FALSE because:\n- In 2010: One nomination and one win (not two nominations).\n- In 2011: Similarly, one of each.\n- He didn't win both awards in either year; he only won one each year.\n\nRelevant cells would be those that show the results for 2010 and 2011 to verify the number of nominations and wins. So the relevant rows are 1, 2, 3, and 4, focusing on the \"result\" column in each case.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"jerry traino win a total of 4 award , 2 for lol award (shared with ensemble) and 2 for nick uk 's funniest person\". \n\nFirst, let's look at the data in the table. Each row represents an award entry for \"icarly\" or \"tuff puppy\", but I don't see any mention of \"jerry traino\" as a winner. The claim is about Jerry Traino winning awards, so I should check if he's mentioned anywhere.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. 2009: Teen Choice Awards - Nominated, not won.\n2. 2010: Australian Kids' Choice Awards - Big Kid Award, nominated; LOL award, won (shared).\n3. 2011: UK Kids' Choice Awards - Nick UK's funniest person, won.\n4. Other entries either mention \"icarly\" or \"tuff puppy\", but not Jerry Traino.\n\nNow, checking the awards he supposedly won:\n\n- The claim says he won two LOL awards and two for Nick UK's funniest person. Looking at the data:\n  - The LOL award was only in 2010, where it was shared, so that's one win.\n  - The Nick UK's funniest person was won once in 2011.\n\nSo he has one win from each category, totaling two wins, not four. Additionally, the table doesn't list Jerry Traino at all; \"icarly\" is a show, so unless he's part of that and implicitly mentioned, but the data doesn't specify individuals beyond the work title.\n\nTherefore, since there are only two awards won in total (both single instances) and no mention of Jerry Traino, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"In 2008 Jerry Traino be nominate for the 2008 Australian Kids' Choice Award in 2 different categories.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what the claim is stating. It mentions two main points:\n1. The year 2008.\n2. That Jerry Traino was nominated twice in that year for the Australian Kids' Choice Awards.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll check each data row to see if any of them match these criteria.\n\nThe table has columns: year, award, category, work, result. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n- The first row is from 2009, so that's not relevant.\n- The second row is 2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards. Award name includes \"australian kids' choice awards\" and the category is \"big kid award.\" Result is nominated.\n- Third row is also 2010, same award but a different category: \"lol award (shared with ensemble)\" and result won.\n- Fourth row is 2011 UK Kids' Choice Awards. So, again not relevant for 2008.\n- Fifth row is 2011 from Brazil, so irrelevant here.\n- Sixth row is 2012 Kids' Choice Awards, different from 2008.\n- Seventh row is 2013 Daytime Emmys, unrelated.\n\nSo in the entire table, there are no entries for the year 2008. The earliest year in the data is 2009. Therefore, there's nothing supporting that Jerry Traino was nominated in 2008 or any related information about two categories in that year. \n\nSince the claim refers to events in 2008 and our table starts from 2009 onwards without any mention of 2008, the claim cannot be supported by the data provided. Therefore, it's FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there are no entries for 2008 in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
