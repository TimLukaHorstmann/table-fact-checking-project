Manchester United beat their competition without letting them score.\n2. Burnley did the same against their opponent.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each relevant row where either Manchester United or Burnley are listed as winners.\n\nStarting with Manchester United: In row 0 of the data, Manchester United is the winner against Watford on April 10, 1970. The score was 2-0. This means Manchester United scored twice, and Watford didn't score at all. So this part checks out.\n\nNext, Burnley's win: In row 4, Burnley is the winner against Leicester City on May 9, 1974. The score here was 1-0. Burnley scored once, and Leicester didn't score any points. This also supports the claim.\n\nBoth parts of the claim are satisfied in their respective rows.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"stoke city win 1 time and lose over a year later\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table data. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. The columns are season, date, winner, loser, score, venue, and attendance. There are five rows of data corresponding to different FA Cup seasons from 1969-70 up to 1973-74.\n\nThe claim mentions two things about Stoke City: that they won once and lost a year later. I need to check if both these events happened as stated.\n\nStarting with the first part, \"Stoke City win 1 time.\" I'll go through each row to see where Stoke is either the winner or loser.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n1. Row 0: Manchester United vs Watford. Stoke isn't involved here.\n2. Row 1: Stoke City is the winner against Everton on May 7, 1971. So that's one win for Stoke.\n3. Row 2: Birmingham City vs Stoke City. Here, it's a draw in extra time and then a penalty shootout. Since it's a draw, neither is considered a loss; instead, they both tied.\n4. Row 3: Wolverhampton Wanderers vs Arsenal. Stoke isn't involved here either.\n5. Row 4: Burnley vs Leicester City. No Stoke here.\n\nSo Stoke only appears in rows 1 and 2. In row 1, they won once, which matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNow for the second part: \"lose over a year later.\" I need to see if Stoke lost any match more than a year after their win on May 7, 1971.\n\nLet me look at each subsequent season:\n\n- After row 1 (May 1971), the next seasons are 1972-73 and 1973-74. \n\nLooking at row 2: August 5, 1972. This is over a year later than May 1971. Here, Stoke City lost to Birmingham City in a penalty shootout after the game ended 0-0. Wait, no\u2014actually, it was Birmingham vs Stoke, and the score shows that Birmingham won on penalties. So Stoke lost this match on August 5, 1972.\n\nSo Stoke did lose a year later (from May 1971 to August 1972 is over a year) in row 2.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported: Stoke won once and then lost more than a year after that win. \n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 1 where Stoke wins: columns \"winner\" (Stoke City) and \"date\".\n- Row 2 where Stoke loses: columns \"loser\" (Stoke City) and \"date\".\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE, with those relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"loser\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So, not relevant for this claim.\n\nRow 2:\n- Season: 1971 - 72 FA Cup\n- Date: August 5, 1972 (this matches the date in the claim)\n- Attendance: 25,841\n\nThis row has both the correct date and venue (St. Andrew's), as well as an attendance figure of 25,841.\n\nRow 3:\n- Season: 1972 - 73 FA Cup\n- Date: August 18, 1973\n- Attendance: 21,038\n\nThis is a different date and season, so it doesn't apply to the claim.

The claim states: \"stoke city and wolverhampton wanderer both beat their competition by score 3 points.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two teams: Stoke City and Wolverhampton Wanderers (Wolves). For each of these teams, I need to check if they were winners in a match where the score was 3-0 or something similar that results in a three-point victory.\n\nLooking at the table's data:\n\n1. **Row 1 (index 1)**: Season is \"1970 - 71 fa cup\". The winner is Stoke City, and they beat Everton with a score of 3-2. That's a one-point win, not three points. So, this doesn't support the claim.\n\n2. **Row 4 (index 4)**: Season is \"1973 - 74 fa cup\". The winner is Burnley, so that's irrelevant. \n\nWait, maybe I missed Wolverhampton Wanderers. Let me check all rows:\n\nLooking again, row index 0: Manchester United won.\n\nRow 1: Stoke City as mentioned.\n\nRow 2: Birmingham City vs Stoke City, which ended in a draw with pens.\n\nRow 3: Wolverhampton Wanderers (Wolves) beat Arsenal with a score of 3-1.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"highbury be the venue for 2 game , in 1970 and 1973\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that Highbury was the venue for two games: one in 1970 and another in 1973. So I need to check if there are exactly two matches held at Highbury with dates corresponding to those years.\n\nLooking at the table, it has multiple rows of data. Each row represents a different FA Cup season and details about each final match. The columns include \"season,\" \"date,\" \"winner,\" \"loser,\" \"score,\" \"venue,\" and \"attendance.\" So the relevant columns for this claim are \"venue\" and \"date.\"\n\nI'll go through each row to check where the venue is Highbury and see if those matches occurred in 1970 or 1973.\n\nStarting with the first row (row index 0): The season is \"1969 - 70 fa cup,\" date is \"10 april 1970,\" and the venue is \"highbury.\" So this match was at Highbury in 1970. That's one occurrence.\n\nNext, row index 1: Venue is \"selhurst park,\" so not relevant. Row index 2: Venue is \"st andrew 's,\" also not relevant. \n\nRow index 3: Season is \"1972 - 73 fa cup,\" date is \"18 august 1973,\" venue is \"highbury.\" So this match was at Highbury in 1973. That's the second occurrence.\n\nRow index 4: Venue is \"filbert street,\" so not relevant here.\n\nSo, there are two games at Highbury: one on April 10, 1970 (row 0) and another on August 18, 1973 (row 3). Both of these fall within the years mentioned in the claim (1970 and 1973).\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there are exactly two games at Highbury in those respective years.\n\nThe relevant cells are the \"venue\" column for both row 0 and row 3, as well as their corresponding dates under the \"date\" column. Wait, actually, since the claim specifies the venue and the years, I should check both the venue and the date to ensure they match.\n\nBut in this case, the dates do fall within 1970 and 1973 respectively. So yes, both venues are correct, and the dates align with the years mentioned.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"Stoke City lose 1 time and win over a year later.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of data in the JSON table to find instances where Stoke City is either the winner or the loser.\n\nStarting with the first row (row index 0), it's about Manchester United vs. Watford on April 10, 1970. Neither team is Stoke City, so this doesn't apply.\n\nMoving to the second row (row index 1), the match is Stoke City against Everton on May 7, 1971. Stoke City won here with a score of 3-2. So that's one win for Stoke City.\n\nThe third row (row index 2) features Birmingham City vs. Stoke City on August 5, 1972. This was a draw in regulation but went to penalties, where Birmingham City won 4-3. Here, Stoke City lost once. \n\nNow, looking at the next rows: row index 3 is Wolverhampton Wanderers vs. Arsenal, and row index 4 is Burnley vs. Leicester City. Neither involves Stoke City.\n\nSo, from the data, I can see that Stoke City lost once (row 2) and won once (row 1). The claim mentions losing once, which matches. Now, checking if they won over a year later: the loss was in August 1972, and the win was in May 1971. Wait, that's actually about a year earlier, not later. So there's an inconsistency here.\n\nWait, no\u2014May 1971 is before August 1972. The claim says \"over a year later,\" meaning more than a year after the loss. But in this case, the win happened before the loss. Therefore, Stoke City didn't have a subsequent win after the loss as claimed.\n\nSo, while they did lose once and won once, the timing doesn't align with the claim that the win was over a year later.

So, I should check if these two teams appear as losers in any of the matches listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are columns: season, date, winner, loser, score, venue, attendance.

Let me double-check each row again:\n\n- Row 0: Manchester United wins.\n- Rows 1-3: Neither team is involved as a loser.\n- Row 4: Burnley wins.\n\nSo, in none of the matches does Manchester United appear as a loser.

Not Selhurst Park.\n4. **Row 3**: Season \"1972 - 73 fa cup\", Venue \"highbury\". Again, not the venue we're looking for.\n5. **Row 4**: Season \"1973 - 74 fa cup\", Venue \"filbert street\". Still not Selhurst Park.\n\nAfter checking all rows, I find that Selhurst Park is only listed once as a venue in Row 1. Since the claim states it was used for two games, but we only have one occurrence, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"stoke city and wolverhampton both beat their competition by only 1 point\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are season, date, winner, loser, score, venue, and attendance. Each row represents a different FA Cup match result.\n\nThe claim mentions two teams: Stoke City and Wolverhampton (which is also known as Wolves). I need to find their respective rows in the data.\n\nLooking at the data:\n- The second row (index 1) shows Stoke City as the winner against Everton with a score of 3 - 2. That's a difference of 1 goal.\n- The fourth row (index 3) has Wolverhampton Wanderers as the winner against Arsenal with a score of 3 - 1. Here, the difference is also 2 goals.\n\nWait, the claim says both teams beat their competition by only 1 point. But in sports like football (soccer), points are usually 3 for a win, not based on the goal difference. However, sometimes people refer to \"points\" when talking about the margin of victory, but that's more common in other contexts.\n\nBut let me check the scores again:\n- Stoke City won 3 - 2: that's a 1-goal difference.\n- Wolverhampton won 3 - 1: that's a 2-goal difference.\n\nIf \"only 1 point\" refers to the goal difference, then only Stoke City fits. Wolverhampton had a bigger margin. So both didn't beat their competition by only 1 point; one did and the other didn't.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because while Stoke City won by 1 goal (which could be seen as 1 point in terms of the difference), Wolverhampton won by 2 goals, so they didn't both have a margin of just 1 point.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- For Stoke City: row index 1, columns 'winner', 'loser', and 'score'.\n- For Wolverhampton: row index 3, same columns.\n\nWait, but in the example given earlier, the user included more than necessary. Maybe I should just list the rows where each team is a winner and check their scores.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Stoke City's row (index 1): looking at 'winner', 'loser', and 'score'.\n- Wolverhampton's row (index 3): same columns.\n\nBut actually, for checking the score difference, only the 'score' column is needed. So maybe I can list the 'score' cells for both rows.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells would be:\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"loser\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"loser\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n]\n\nBut perhaps the key is just to check each winner's score. So for each team, their respective row and 'score' column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only the scores are necessary because that directly shows the margin of victory. So:\n\n[\n  {\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n  {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n]\n\nThat's enough to see the goal differences. Since in one case it's +1 and the other is +2, the claim that both beat by only 1 point is false.\n\nSo putting it all together: answer is FALSE, relevant cells are the scores of Stoke City (row 1) and Wolverhampton (row 3).\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both Stoke City and Wolverhampton Wanderers won their matches with a margin of just one goal each. However, Stoke City won by 3-2 (a 1-goal difference), while Wolverhampton won by 3-1 (a 2-goal difference). Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
