    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"each time minnesota be the home team, the attendance be the same\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record. Each row represents a game with specific details about that game.\n\nThe claim says that every time Minnesota is the home team, the attendance number remains the same. So, my task is to check all rows where \"home\" is Minnesota and see if the \"attendance\" column has the same value in each of those rows.\n\nI'll start by identifying which rows have Minnesota as the home team. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Home is Minnesota? No, visitor is Chicago. So not relevant.\n2. Row 1: Visitor is Columbus, home is Minnesota. Yes, so this is a relevant row. Attendance here is 18568.\n3. Row 2: Visitor is Edmonton, home is Minnesota. Yes. Attendance is also 18568. Same as before.\n4. Row 3: Home is Phoenix, visitor is Minnesota. So not relevant because home isn't Minnesota.\n5. Row 4: Visitor is Anaheim, home is Minnesota. Yes. Attendance here is 17174. Wait, that's different from the previous two rows which were 18568. Hmm, this could be a problem for the claim.\n6. Row 5: Visitor is LA, home is Minnesota. Yes. Attendance is 14239. That's another different number.\n7. Row 6: Visitor is St Louis, home is Minnesota. Attendance is 19150. Different again.\n8. Row 7: Visitor is Colorado, home is Minnesota. Attendance is 18568. Same as rows 1 and 2 but different from others.\n9. Row 8: Home is Calgary, visitor is Minnesota. Not relevant.\n10. Row 9: Home is Edmonton, visitor is Minnesota. Not relevant.\n11. Row 10: Visitor is Colorado, home is Minnesota. Attendance is 17041. Different again.\n12. Row 11: Visitor is Pittsburgh, home is Minnesota. Attendance is 18568.\n\nWait a second, so in the rows where home is Minnesota (rows 1,2,4,5,6,7,10,11), I see attendance numbers like 18568, 17174, 14239, 19150, etc. These are all different from each other.\n\nSo the claim is that whenever Minnesota is home, the attendance should be the same. But looking at these values, it's clear that there are multiple different attendances. For example:\n\n- Row 1: 18568\n- Row 4: 17174\n- Row 5: 14239\n- Row 6: 19150\n\nThese variations mean the claim is false because the attendance isn't consistent every time Minnesota hosts a game.\n\nTherefore, I'll mark this as FALSE and list all the relevant rows where home was Minnesota so that the checker can see the differing attendances.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that whenever Minnesota is the home team, the attendance remains the same. Checking each instance where \"home\" is Minnesota reveals varying attendance numbers. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the highest number of attendee at a game be on october 24 , with 19289 crowd attendance.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is asserting. It's saying two things:\n\n1. October 24th had the highest number of attendees.\n2. The attendance on that day was 19,289.\n\nI should check both parts against the data provided in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record. So, the relevant columns for this claim are \"date\" and \"attendance.\"\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to look at the dates and the corresponding attendance numbers.\n\nRow 0:\n- Date: october 4\n- Attendance: 18568\n\nRow 1:\n- Date: october 6\n- Attendance: 18568\n\nRow 2:\n- Date: october 10\n- Attendance: 18568\n\nRow 3:\n- Date: october 13\n- Attendance: 12088\n\nRow 4:\n- Date: october 14\n- Attendance: 17174\n\nRow 5:\n- Date: october 16\n- Attendance: 14239\n\nRow 6:\n- Date: october 20\n- Attendance: 19150\n\nRow 7:\n- Date: october 21\n- Attendance: 18568\n\nRow 8:\n- Date: october 24\n- Attendance: 19289\n\nRow 9:\n- Date: october 25\n- Attendance: 16839\n\nRow 10:\n- Date: october 28\n- Attendance: 17041\n\nRow 11:\n- Date: october 30\n- Attendance: 18568\n\nNow, I'll note down all the attendance numbers and their corresponding dates:\n\n- October 4: 18,568\n- October 6: 18,568\n- October 10: 18,568\n- October 13: 12,088\n- October 14: 17,174\n- October 16: 14,239\n- October 20: 19,150\n- October 21: 18,568\n- October 24: 19,289\n- October 25: 16,839\n- October 28: 17,041\n- October 30: 18,568\n\nLooking at these numbers, the highest attendance is indeed on October 24th with 19,289. The next highest is October 20th with 19,150, which is less than 19,289.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are correct: October 24th had the highest attendance, and that number was 19,289.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's see. I need to determine if the claim \"minnesota play more games away than at home during the 2007 season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I should understand what each column in the table represents. The columns are date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record. It looks like each row represents a game. The 'visitor' is the team that's visiting, and the 'home' is where they're playing.\n\nThe claim is about Minnesota's games\u2014whether they played more away games than home games in 2007. So I need to count how many times Minnesota was the visitor (away) and how many times they were the home team during these games.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. October 4: Visitor is Chicago, Home is Minnesota. So this is a home game for Minnesota.\n2. October 6: Visitor is Columbus, Home is Minnesota. Another home game.\n3. October 10: Visitor is Edmonton, Home is Minnesota. Home again.\n4. October 13: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Phoenix. This is an away game for them.\n5. October 14: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Anaheim. Away again.\n6. October 16: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is LA. Another away game.\n7. October 20: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is St. Louis. Away.\n8. October 21: Visitor is Colorado, Home is Minnesota. Back to home.\n9. October 24: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Calgary. Away again.\n10. October 25: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Edmonton. Another away.\n11. October 28: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Colorado. Away.\n12. October 30: Visitor is Pittsburgh, Home is Minnesota. Home game.\n\nNow, counting:\n\nHome games (rows where 'home' is Minnesota): Rows 0,1,2,7,11. That's 5 home games.\n\nAway games (rows where 'visitor' is Minnesota): Rows 3,4,5,6,9,10,11? Wait, no\u2014row 11 is home for Minnesota because the visitor is Pittsburgh and home is Minnesota. So let me recount:\n\nLooking at each row again:\n\nRows:\n- Row 0: Home\n- Row 1: Home\n- Row 2: Home\n- Row3: Away\n- Row4: Away\n- Row5: Away\n- Row6: Away (visitor is MN)\n- Row7: Home\n- Row8: Visitor is Colorado, home is MN\u2014so home game.\nWait no, row8 is October 21st. The visitor is Colorado, home is Minnesota. So that's a home game for MN.\n\nRow9: Visitor is MN, home is Calgary\u2014away.\nRow10: Visitor MN, home Edmonton\u2014away.\nRow11: Visitor Pittsburgh, home MN\u2014home.\n\nSo correcting:\n\nHome games are rows 0,1,2,7,8,11. That's 6 home games.\n\nAway games are rows3,4,5,6,9,10. That's 6 away games.\n\nWait, so that would mean they played the same number of home and away games? But let me double-check:\n\nList again:\n\nRow indices from 0 to 11 (since there are 12 entries):\n\n- Row0: Home\n- Row1: Home\n- Row2: Home\n- Row3: Away\n- Row4: Away\n- Row5: Away\n- Row6: Away\n- Row7: Home\n- Row8: Visitor is Colorado, so MN is home\u2014yes.\n- Row9: Away\n- Row10: Away\n- Row11: Home\n\nSo home games are rows 0,1,2,7,8,11. That's 6 home games.\n\nAway games are rows3,4,5,6,9,10\u2014total of 6 away games.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"more games away than at home.\" So if they played equally, it would be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, let me count again:\n\nHome games: \n\n- Row0: MN as home\n- Row1: MN as home\n- Row2: MN as home\n- Row7: MN as home (since visitor is Colorado)\n- Row8: MN as home? Wait, no\u2014row8's data is [october 21, Colorado, score, Minnesota]. So yes, MN is home.\n\nRow11: Visitor is Pittsburgh, home is MN. So that's another home game.\n\nSo total of 6 home games.\n\nAway games:\n\n- Row3: MN as visitor to Phoenix\n- Row4: MN as visitor to Anaheim\n- Row5: MN as visitor to LA\n- Row6: MN as visitor to St. Louis (wait, no\u2014row6 is October 20th.

Wait no, looking at the table data provided earlier\u2014I think I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me list all 12 rows with their visitor and home:\n\n0: Chicago (visitor), Minnesota (home)\n1: Columbus (visitor), Minnesota (home)\n2: Edmonton (visitor), Minnesota (home)\n3: MN (visitor), Phoenix (home)\n4: MN (visitor), Anaheim (home)\n5: MN (visitor), LA (home)\n6: MN (visitor), St. Louis (home)\n7: MN (visitor), Calgary (home)? Wait, no\u2014row7 is October 20th, visitor is MN, home is St. Louis.\n\nWait, I think I might have miscounted earlier.\n\nLet me clarify each row:\n\nRow indices and data:\n\nRow0: Visitor: Chicago, Home: Minnesota \u2192 Home game for MN\nRow1: Visitor: Columbus, Home: Minnesota \u2192 Home\nRow2: Visitor: Edmonton, Home: Minnesota \u2192 Home\nRow3: Visitor: MN, Home: Phoenix \u2192 Away\nRow4: Visitor: MN, Home: Anaheim \u2192 Away\nRow5: Visitor: MN, Home: LA \u2192 Away\nRow6: Visitor: MN, Home: St. Louis \u2192 Away\nRow7: Visitor: MN, Home: Calgary \u2192 Away (Wait no\u2014row7 is visitor MN to Calgary? Or is it home?)\n\nWait, the data as per the user's message:\n\nThe table has 12 rows with columns date, visitor, score, home, etc.\n\nSo row3 is October 13th: Visitor MN, Home Phoenix. So away for MN.\n\nRow4: October 14th:Visitor MN, Home Anaheim \u2192 away.\n\nRow5: Oct 16:Visitor MN, Home LA \u2192 away.\n\nRow6: Oct20:Visitor MN, home St. Louis \u2192 away.\n\nRow7:Oct21: Visitor Colorado, home Minnesota \u2192 home for MN.\n\nRow8:Oct24:Visitor MN, home Calgary\u2192away.\n\nRow9:Oct25:Visitor MN, home Edmonton\u2192away.\n\nRow10:Oct28:Visitor MN, home Colorado\u2192away.\n\nRow11:Oct30:Visitor Pittsburgh, home Minnesota\u2192home.\n\nSo let's count:\n\nHome games for MN:\n\nRows 0,1,2,7,11 \u2192 that's 5 home games.\n\nAway games:\n\nRows3,4,5,6,8,9,10 \u2192 that's 7 away games.\n\nWait, so 5 home and 7 away. That would mean more away games than home games, making the claim TRUE.\n\nBut earlier I thought it was equal because I miscounted. So now, correcting:\n\nHome:5\n\nAway:7\n\nSo yes, more away games.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as Minnesota played 7 away games compared to 5 home games during the 2007 season based on the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": {\n    \"home_games_count\": 5,\n    \"away_games_count\": 7,\n    \"claim_status\": \"TRUE\"\n  }\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"minnesota play colorado 2 times during the 2007-2008 season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I should check if all entries in the table are from the same season. The dates range from October 4 to October 30, but the year isn't specified. However, since it's common for sports seasons to span across two calendar years, and considering typical hockey seasons, this data likely represents a portion of the 2007-2008 season.\n\nNext, I'll look for instances where Minnesota played against Colorado. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Opponent is Chicago.\n2. **Row 1**: Opponent is Columbus.\n3. **Row 2**: Opponent is Edmonton.\n4. **Row 3**: Opponent is Phoenix.\n5. **Row 4**: Opponent is Anaheim.\n6. **Row 5**: Opponent is Los Angeles.\n7. **Row 6**: Opponent is St. Louis.\n8. **Row 7**: Minnesota vs Colorado on October 21, so that's one game.\n9. **Row 8**: Opponent is Calgary.\n10. **Row 9**: Opponent is Edmonton.\n11. **Row 10**: Minnesota plays against Colorado again on October 28. That's the second game.\n12. **Row 11**: Opponent is Pittsburgh.\n\nSo, there are two instances where Minnesota played against Colorado: rows 7 and 10.

The claim is about whether the attendance varies every time Minnesota is the home team. So, my focus should be on rows where \"home\" is \"minnesota\" and then check the corresponding \"attendance\" values.\n\nLet me go through each row to identify when Minnesota is the home team and note their attendances:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Home is Minnesota.

The columns are date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record. Each row represents a game with these details.\n\nThe claim mentions the average attendance during the 2007-2008 season is 18568. However, the dates in the table are all in October, which suggests this data might be from one month of that season or possibly another time frame. I should check if all these games fall within the same season as claimed.\n\nLooking at the 'attendance' column, each row has a specific attendance number. To find the average, I need to collect all these numbers and compute their mean. Let me list them out:\n\n- Row 0: 18568\n- Row 1: 18568\n- Row 2: 18568\n- Row 3: 12088\n- Row 4: 17174\n- Row 5: 14239\n- Row 6: 19150\n- Row 7: 18568\n- Row 8: 19289\n- Row 9: 16839\n- Row 10: 17041\n- Row 11: 18568\n\nNow, adding these up:\n\nLet me compute the sum step by step:\n\nStart with 18568 (Row 0)\n+18568 = 37136 (Row 1)\n+18568 = 55704 (Row 2)\n+12088 = 67792 (Row 3)\n+17174 = 84966 (Row 4)\n+14239 = 99205 (Row 5)\n+19150 = 118,355 (Row 6)\n+18568 = 136,923 (Row 7)\n+19289 = 156,212 (Row 8)\n+16839 = 173,051 (Row 9)\n+17041 = 190,092 (Row 10)\n+18568 = 208,660 (Row 11)\n\nTotal sum is 208,660. There are 12 games in total.\n\nNow, compute the average: 208,660 \u00f7 12 \u2248 17,388.33.\n\nThe claim states the average was 18,568, but according to these calculations, it's approximately 17,388. So the average is lower than what the claim says.\n\nAdditionally, I notice that not all games have the same attendance of 18,568; some are higher and others lower. The majority (rows 0-2 and 7,11) have 18,568, but there are variations like 12,088 in row 3.\n\nTherefore, the average isn't exactly 18,568 as claimed.

    "claim": "the highest number of attendee at a game be october 30 , with 18568 fan present",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the highest number of attendee at a game be october 30, with 18568 fan present\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the table structure. The columns are date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record. Each row represents a game with details about that game.\n\nThe claim states two things: \n1. The highest number of attendees was on October 30.\n2. There were 18568 fans present that day.\n\nI'll start by checking each row's 'attendance' to find the maximum value and see which date corresponds to it.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- October 4: 18,568\n- October 6: 18,568\n- October 10: 18,568\n- October 13: 12,088 (lower)\n- October 14: 17,174 (higher than some but lower than others)\n- October 16: 14,239 (lower)\n- October 20: 19,150 (higher than most)\n- October 21: 18,568\n- October 24: 19,289 (higher than October 20's attendance)\n- October 25: 16,839 (lower)\n- October 28: 17,041 (lower)\n- October 30: 18,568\n\nWait a minute, the highest attendance I see is on October 24 with 19,289 attendees. October 20 has 19,150 which is also higher than October 30's 18,568.\n\nSo according to this, October 30 isn't the date with the highest attendance. The highest was on October 24.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check all rows to make sure I haven't missed any with higher numbers. Scanning again:\n\n- Rows before October 20: Most are around 18k except Oct 13 is lower.\n- October 20: 19,150\n- October 24: 19,289 (higher than Oct 20)\n- October 30: 18,568\n\nSo the highest attendance is on October 24 with 19,289. Therefore, the claim that October 30 had the highest attendance isn't correct.\n\nWait another thought: Perhaps I misread a row? Let me check each 'attendance' value:\n\nRow indices (starting from 0):\n\n- 0: 18568\n- 1: 18568\n- 2: 18568\n- 3: 12088\n- 4: 17174\n- 5: 14239\n- 6: 19150 (October 20)\n- 7: 18568 (October 21)\n- 8: 19289 (October 24) - this is higher than October 20.\n- 9: 16839\n- 10: 17041\n- 11: 18568 (October 30)\n\nYes, the highest attendance is indeed on October 24 with 19,289. So the claim that October 30 had the highest isn't correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because while October 30 did have an attendance of 18568, it wasn't the highest; October 24 had a higher number.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that October 30 had the highest attendance with 18,568 attendees. However, checking the table reveals that on October 24, there were 19,289 attendees, which is higher than October 30's figure.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim \"Minnesota played more home than away games in the 2007 season\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what data is given here. The table has several columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record. Each row represents a game from October with various details about that game.\n\nThe claim is about whether Minnesota had more home games than away games during the 2007 season as per this table. So I need to determine how many times Minnesota was playing at home versus how many times they were the visitor.\n\nLooking at each row, specifically the \"visitor\" and \"home\" columns:\n\n1. October 4: Visitor is Chicago, Home is Minnesota \u2192 This counts as a home game for Minnesota.\n2. October 6: Visitor is Columbus, Home is Minnesota \u2192 Another home game.\n3. October 10: Visitor is Edmonton, Home is Minnesota \u2192 Home game again.\n4. October 13: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Phoenix \u2192 Here, Minnesota is the visitor, so this counts as an away game.\n5. October 14: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Anaheim \u2192 Another away game for Minnesota.\n6. October 16: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Los Angeles \u2192 Away game again.\n7. October 20: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is St Louis \u2192 This is another away game.\n8. October 21: Visitor is Colorado, Home is Minnesota \u2192 Back to a home game for Minnesota.\n9. October 24: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Calgary \u2192 Another away game.\n10. October 25: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Edmonton \u2192 Yet another away game.\n11. October 28: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Colorado \u2192 Away game again.\n12. October 30: Visitor is Pittsburgh, Home is Minnesota \u2192 Finally, a home game for Minnesota.\n\nNow, let's count the number of home and away games:\n\nHome games (rows where \"home\" is Minnesota):\n- Row 0\n- Row 1\n- Row 2\n- Row 7\n- Row 11\n\nThat's a total of 5 home games.\n\nAway games (rows where \"visitor\" is Minnesota):\n- Row 3\n- Row 4\n- Row 5\n- Row 6\n- Row 8\n- Row 9\n- Row 10\n\nThat's 7 away games.\n\nSo, according to this table, Minnesota played more away games than home games in the given period. Therefore, the claim that they played more home games is false.\n\nI should also note which cells were relevant for this determination. For each row, I checked both the \"visitor\" and \"home\" columns to see if Minnesota was playing at home or away. The relevant cells are all rows from 0 to 11 with the column names \"visitor\" and \"home\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"home\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine whether the claim \"minnesota and colorado do not play each other during the 2007-2008 season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table data.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the JSON data. It has columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, record. The rows represent individual games with details about each game. \n\nThe claim states that Minnesota and Colorado did not play each other during the specified season. To verify this, I need to check if there are any instances where either Minnesota is the visitor against Colorado as the home team or vice versa.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n1. **October 4**: Visitor is Chicago, Home is Minnesota. No match.\n2. **October 6**: Visitor is Columbus, Home is Minnesota. No match.\n3. **October 10**: Visitor is Edmonton, Home is Minnesota. No match.\n4. **October 13**: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Phoenix. No match.\n5. **October 14**: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Anaheim. No match.\n6. **October 16**: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Los Angeles. No match.\n7. **October 20**: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is St Louis. No match.\n8. **October 21**: Visitor is Colorado, Home is Minnesota. Ah, here we have a game where Colorado visited Minnesota.\n9. **October 24**: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Calgary.

Another game where Minnesota plays against Colorado as the home team.\n12. **October 30**: Visitor is Pittsburgh, Home is Minnesota. No match.\n\nFrom this, I can see that there are two instances where Minnesota and Colorado played each other: on October 21 (Colorado vs. Minnesota) and October 28 (Minnesota vs. Colorado). \n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because they did play against each other during the season covered in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells showing the games between Minnesota and Colorado are at row indices 7 and 10 under the \"visitor\" and \"home\" columns.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"home\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
