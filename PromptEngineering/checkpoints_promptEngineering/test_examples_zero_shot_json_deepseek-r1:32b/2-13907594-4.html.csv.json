    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided in JSON format.\n\nFirst, let me read and understand the claim: \"5 - 4 (ot) be the score that have a location and attendance of montreal forum and the date after may 10\". Hmm, so the claim is saying there's a game with a score of 5-4 OT at Montreal Forum, and the date is after May 10.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to check for these conditions.\n\nStarting from the top:\nRow 0: April 26 vs Bruins, score 4-2. Location is Montreal Forum, but the date isn't after May 10.\nRow 1: April 28, same as above.\nRow 2: May 1 at Boston Garden. Not relevant.\nRow 3: May 3, same location. No.\nRow 4: May 5, back to Montreal Forum. Score is 5-1, not 5-4 OT.\nRow 5: May 8, Boston Garden again. Doesn't fit.\nRow 6: May 10 at Montreal Forum, score 5-4 OT. That's exactly what the claim states.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the date after may 10\". The game is on May 10, not after. So does that mean it doesn't satisfy? Or perhaps the wording could be a bit ambiguous. But in this case, the game is on May 10, so the date isn't after; it's exactly on May 10.\n\nTherefore, there's no entry where the score is 5-4 OT at Montreal Forum with a date after May 10. The only occurrence is on May 10 itself. So the claim is FALSE because it specifies \"after may 10\" but the game happened on May 10.\n\nThe relevant cells would be row 6, columns for score and location/attendance to confirm the details.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
