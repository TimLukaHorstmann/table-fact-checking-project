    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the people from the country / region of Vietnam speak the language Vietnamese\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: country/region, languages, premiere, seasons, and status. Each row represents data about a specific country or region regarding some show or series, including the language spoken there.\n\nThe claim is about Vietnam, so I should find the row where \"country / region\" is Vietnam. Scanning through the data, I see that one of the rows is for Vietnam. Let me check its details.\n\nLooking at the Vietnam row: The country/region is Vietnam, and under languages, it says Vietnamese. So, according to this table, people in Vietnam speak Vietnamese.\n\nSince the claim directly matches what's stated in the table, the answer should be TRUE. Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant for this conclusion. The two key pieces of information are the country/region being Vietnam and the language spoken there, which is Vietnamese.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n- The \"country / region\" column for Vietnam (row index 24)\n- The \"languages\" column for Vietnam (same row)\n\nI should note their positions correctly. Let me count the rows to make sure of the indices. Starting from 0, the last few entries are Poland (16), Portugal (17), Scandinavia (18), South Africa (19), Turkey (20), Ukraine (21), United Kingdom (22), United States (23), and Vietnam is row 24.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the relevant cells are in row 24 under \"country / region\" and \"languages\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cells are as identified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"country / region\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"languages\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the show in israel be in the hebrew language and be ongoing\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table structure. The columns are: country/region, languages, premiere, seasons, status. Each row represents a different region with corresponding details about the show.\n\nLooking at the data rows, I need to find the one where \"country / region\" is \"israel\". Scanning through each row:\n\n- The 12th entry (index starting from 0) has \"israel\" as the country/region. So that's the relevant row.\n\nNow, checking the claim: two conditions must be met.\n1. Language should be Hebrew.\n2. Status should be ongoing.\n\nFrom the data:\n- The \"languages\" column for israel says \"hebrew\". That matches.\n- The \"status\" column shows \"discontinued\", which does not match the condition of being ongoing.\n\nSince the second condition isn't satisfied, the claim isn't fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nI'll note the relevant cells: row 12 for both languages and status to highlight where the checks were made.\n</think>\n\nThe show in Israel is listed with Hebrew as its language but has a status of \"discontinued\", not ongoing.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"languages\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"status\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
