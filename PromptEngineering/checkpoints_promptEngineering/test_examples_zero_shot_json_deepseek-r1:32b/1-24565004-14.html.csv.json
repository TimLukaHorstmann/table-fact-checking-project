The table has several columns, but for this claim, the relevant columns are likely the player's name and their appearances. \n\nLooking through the rows, I find \"st\u00e9phane mah\u00e9\" in row 2. The columns include 'appearances' which is the number of times they've appeared. Similarly, I locate \"larrys mabiala\" in row 0.\n\nFrom the data:\n- St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 has 68 appearances.\n- Larrys Mabiala has 48 appearances.\n\nThe claim states that St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 has 20 more appearances than Larrys Mabiala.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the data provided. The claim states that \"fran\u00e7ois m'pel\u00e9 be the highest scorer for the paris saint-germain football club though bernard mendy have the most appearance.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify which parts of this claim need verification. There are two main points here: \n\n1. Fran\u00e7ois M'Pel\u00e9 is the highest scorer.\n2. Bernard Mendy has the most appearances.\n\nI'll go through each player's data in the table provided to check these facts.\n\nLooking at the data, I see that each row represents a player with details like their name, position, years active, appearances, goals scored, and nationality. \n\nStarting with Fran\u00e7ois M'Pel\u00e9: I scan through the rows until I find his name. He is listed in row 34 (since counting starts from 0). His positions are \"forward,\" he played from 1973 to 1979, made 217 appearances, and scored 95 goals. \n\nNext, checking if he's the highest scorer: I'll compare his goal count with other forwards or players who might have higher scores. Looking through the table:\n\n- Row 0: Fran\u00e7ois M'Pel\u00e9 has 95 goals.\n- Row 12: Thierry Morin is a defender with 174 appearances but only 1 goal, so not relevant for scoring.\n- Row 13: Thiago Motta as a midfielder scored 3 goals.\n- Other forwards like Monteiro in row 23 have 5 goals, which is less than 95. \n\nIt seems Fran\u00e7ois M'Pel\u00e9 indeed has the highest number of goals among all listed players.\n\nNow, moving on to Bernard Mendy: He's listed in row 17. His position is \"midfielder,\" he played from 2011 onwards (assumed current as per the data), made 84 appearances, and scored 17 goals. \n\nTo check if he has the most appearances, I need to find the player with the highest number of appearances. Scanning through:\n\n- Row 0: 217\n- Row 5: Thierry Morin has 174\n- Row 17: Bernard Mendy has 84\n\nWait a minute,Fran\u00e7ois M'Pel\u00e9 in row 34 has 217 appearances, which is higher than Bernard Mendy's 84. Also, Thierry Morin in row 12 has 174 appearances.\n\nSo, Fran\u00e7ois M'Pel\u00e9 not only has the most goals but also the highest number of appearances. This contradicts the claim that Bernard Mendy has the most appearances.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because while Fran\u00e7ois M'Pel\u00e9 is indeed the top scorer, he also leads in appearances, making Bernard Mendy's status as the player with the most appearances false.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"appearances\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"appearances\"}\n   ]\n}",

I need to verify if this is true based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the data. Each row represents a player with details like Name, Position, Appearances, Goals, etc. The relevant columns here are \"Name\" and \"Appearances\".\n\nThe claim specifically mentions two players: Franck M\u00e9relle and Mario Mongelli. So, I'll search for these names in the table to find their respective appearance counts.\n\nStarting with Franck M\u00e9relle. Scanning through the rows, I find his name in row 20. The Appearances column shows he has 1 appearance. That's consistent with the claim.\n\nNext, Mario Mongelli is mentioned. Looking for him in the data, I spot his name in row 22. Checking his Appearances, it also says 1. So far, both players have exactly one appearance each, which aligns with what the claim states.\n\nBut wait, the claim says that only these two have one appearance. To confirm this, I need to check all other rows to ensure no other player has an Appearance value of exactly 1.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n- Row 0: 396 appearances.\n- Row 1: 438.\n- ...\n- Row 20: Franck M\u00e9relle with 1 (already noted).\n- ...\n- Row 22: Mario Mongelli with 1 (also noted).\n- Other rows have varying numbers, but looking for any other 1s.\n\nUpon reviewing all rows, it seems that no other player has exactly one appearance.

Let me check each nationality:\n\nRow 0: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 1: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 2: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 3: Republic of the Congo \u274c (Count 1)  \nRow 4: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 5: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 6: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 7: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 8: Italy \u274c (Count 2)  \nRow 9: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 10: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 11: Brazil \u274c (Count 3)  \nRow 12: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 13: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 14: Republic of the Congo \u274c (Count 4)  \n\nWait, so up to row 14, we have four non-French players.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 15: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 16: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 17: Italy \u274c (Count 5)  \nRow 18: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 19: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 20: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 21: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 22: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 23: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 24: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 25: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 26: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 27: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 28: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 29: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 30: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 31: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 32: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 33: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 34: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 35: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 36: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 37: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 38: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 39: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 40: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 41: France \u2714\ufe0f  \nRow 42: France \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nWait, that can't be right because the data provided in the JSON snippet doesn't go up to row 42. Perhaps I miscounted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the data only includes a subset of players, and the non-French count is less than 10. Let me recount based on the initial data provided.\n\nIn the given data:\n\nRows with non-French nationalities are:\n\nRow 3: Republic of the Congo  \nRow 8: Italy  \nRow 11: Brazil  \nRow 14: Republic of the Congo  \n\nSo that's four players so far. Continuing beyond row 14, assuming there are more players:\n\nAssuming each additional player is French unless specified otherwise, and perhaps a few more non-French.\n\nBut according to the initial data provided up to row 14, we have four non-French players. Thus, the total number of non-French players would be less than 10, making the statement true.\n</think>\n\nThe statement is **True**.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Task:** Determine if fewer than ten players are from countries other than France based on the provided data.\n\n2. **Analyze Data:**\n   - Examine each player's nationality in the given list up to row 42.\n   - Count how many players are not French.\n\n3. **Count Non-French Players:**\n   - From rows 0 to 14, non-French players are found at:\n     - Row 3: Republic of the Congo\n     - Row 8: Italy\n     - Row 11: Brazil\n     - Row 14: Republic of the Congo\n   - Total non-French count from this section: **4**\n\n4. **Assess Remaining Data:**\n   - Assuming players beyond row 14 are French unless specified otherwise.\n   - Additional non-French entries, if any, would be minimal based on initial trends.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The total number of non-French players is **less than ten**, making the statement true.\n\n**Answer:** True",

St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 is in row 2 (index starts at 0), and Larrys Mabiala is in row 0.\n\nNext, I need their appearances as defenders. For Larrys Mabiala, under \"appearances\" which is column \"appearances\", he has 22. St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9's appearances are in the same column, showing 68.\n\nCalculating the difference: 68 (Mah\u00e9) minus 22 (Mabiala) equals 46. The claim says Mah\u00e9 has less than 10 more appearances, but 46 is much larger than 10.

I need to verify the claim that \"micka\u00ebl madar and j\u00e9r\u00e9my m\u00e9nez both score only 10 in their entire career.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the data provided. The table has several columns: Player Name, Position, Years Active, Goals, Assists, Nationality. Each row corresponds to a different player.\n\nI need to find the rows for Micka\u00ebl Madar and J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. **Micka\u00ebl Madar**: I'll search through the \"Player Name\" column until I find his name. Looking at the data, I see that row 0 has \"micka\u00ebl madar\". The relevant columns for goals and assists are in columns \"Goals\" and \"Assists\". For Micka\u00ebl Madar, the Goals are 10, and Assists are 2.\n\n2. **J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez**: Next, I'll look for his name in the \"Player Name\" column. Row 19 has \"j\u00e9r\u00e9my menez\". Checking the relevant columns, he has 17 goals and 8 assists.\n\nNow, evaluating the claim: The claim states that both players scored only 10 in their entire career. However, from the data:\n\n- Micka\u00ebl Madar has 10 goals.\n- J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez has 17 goals.\n\nSince J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez has more than 10 goals (he has 17), the claim is not fully supported by the data provided. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nI'll compile the relevant cells for both players to show where the data was checked:\n\n- For Micka\u00ebl Madar: Goals and Assists in row 0.\n- For J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez: Goals and Assists in row 19.\n\nThis helps in clearly showing which parts of the table were used to verify each player's statistics.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Assists\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to verify the claim: \"bernard mendy have the most appearance and score the most goal for the paris saint-germain football club.\" \n\nFirst, let's parse the table provided. The table has rows with player details including Name, Appearances, Goals, etc. My task is to check if Bernard Mendy indeed has the highest number of appearances and goals among all listed players.\n\nLooking through the rows, I need to find Bernard Mendy's data. Scanning down, I see that at row index 17 (since counting starts from 0), there's \"bernard moraly\". Wait, that's not Mendy. Let me check again. Oh, no, wait: row index 19 is \"bernard moraly\", and row index 23 is \"bernard moraly\" as well? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking back, the rows are numbered from 0 to, let's see, up to 36. Let me go through each row carefully:\n\nRow 0: \"franck mirelle\"\nRow 1: \"roland mitoraj\"\n...\nAh, row index 17 is \"bernard moraly\" \u2013 no, wait, that's not correct. I think I might have miscounted earlier. Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps the table has a structure with multiple rows. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the data array, each object represents a player. So row 0 is the first player, row 1 next, etc. \n\nI need to find \"bernard mendy\" in the Name column. Scanning through the Names: \n\nAt row index 17: \"bernard moraly\"\nRow index 23: \"fabrice moreau\"\nRow index 26: \"thierry morin\"\nRow index 28: \"jean-michel moutier\"\nRow index 30: \"fran\u00e7ois mp\u00e9l\u00e9\" \u2013 that's Fran\u00e7ois M'P\u00e9l\u00e9\nRow index 31: \"youssuf mulumbu\"\nRow index 32: \"edwin murati\"\n\nWait, I don't see \"bernard mendy\" in any of the rows.

Oh, maybe the name is spelled differently. Let me search for \"bernard\" in all rows.\n\nRow 4: bernard moraly (Appearances: 21, Goals: 0)\nRow 5: fabrice moreau\nRow 6: thierry morin\n... No other \"bernard\" except row 4 and perhaps others? Wait, no. So where is Bernard Mendy?\n\nWait a second, maybe I'm missing the player because he's not in this table. Because looking through all the rows from 0 to 35 (assuming that's how many there are), I don't see any \"bernard mendy\". \n\nTherefore, if Bernard Mendy isn't listed in the table at all, we can't confirm his appearances or goals.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to evaluate the claim: \"nobody have only 1 appearance on this team, though 2 have 2 appearances.\" I'll start by understanding what each part of the claim is asserting.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n1. Nobody has exactly 1 appearance.\n2. Exactly two players have 2 appearances.\n\nI need to verify both statements against the data provided in the table. \n\nLooking at the table structure, I see columns like \"appearances\" which would be relevant for this claim. Wait, actually, looking back, the table doesn't explicitly have a column named \"appearances.\" Instead, it has \"season,\" \"apps,\" \"goals,\" and \"nationality.\" Hmm, that's confusing because the original question mentioned appearances but didn't specify how that's represented in the data.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again. The table provided doesn't have a column named \"appearances\" or \"apps\" as I initially thought. Instead, the columns are likely different. Let me look at the JSON structure:\n\nThe table has headers: \"season\", \"apps\", \"goals\", \"nationality\". So \"apps\" probably stands for appearances. That makes sense. So each player's number of appearances is under the \"apps\" column.\n\nNow, let's proceed. I need to check two things:\n- Are there any players with exactly 1 appearance? If yes, then the first part of the claim (\"nobody have only 1\") is false.\n- How many players have exactly 2 appearances? The second part claims that exactly two players do.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: apps = 3\nRow 1: apps = 1 (Uh oh, this contradicts the first part of the claim)\nRow 2: apps = 34\nRow 3: apps = 7\n... and so on.\n\nWait, actually, let me go through each row systematically:\n\nLooking at each player's \"apps\" value:\n- Row 0: 3 \u2192 not 1 or 2.\n- Row 1: 1 \u2192 This is a problem because the claim says nobody has 1 appearance. So this invalidates the first part.\n- Row 2: 34 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- Row 3: 7 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- Row 4: 65 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- Row 5: 34 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- Row 6: 40 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- Row 7: 18 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- Row 8: 39 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- Row 9: 20 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- Row 10: 59 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- Row 11: 46 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- Row 12: 47 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- Row 13: 28 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- Row 14: 1 \u2192 Another one with 1 appearance. So now we have two players with 1 appearance, which contradicts the first part of the claim that says \"nobody have only 1.\"\nWait, no\u2014actually, row 1 has apps =1, and then looking further down:\n\nRow 15: 2 \u2192 This is a player with 2 appearances.\nRow 16: 49 \u2192 Not relevant.\nRow 17: 30 \u2192 Not relevant.\nRow 18: 1 \u2192 Another player with 1 appearance. So now we have two players with 1 appearance, which makes the first part of the claim (\"nobody have only 1\") false.\n\nBut wait, I thought the second part was \"though 2 have 2 appearances.\" Let's check how many players have exactly 2 appearances:\n\nLooking again:\nRow 0:3\nRow1:1\nRow2:34\n...\nRow 15:2 \u2192 One player.\nAny others? Let me check all rows for apps=2.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\nRow0:3\u2192 no\nRow1:1\u2192 no\nRow2:34\u2192 no\nRow3:7\u2192 no\nRow4:65\u2192 no\nRow5:34\u2192 no\nRow6:40\u2192 no\nRow7:18\u2192 no\nRow8:39\u2192 no\nRow9:20\u2192 no\nRow10:59\u2192 no\nRow11:46\u2192 no\nRow12:47\u2192 no\nRow13:28\u2192 no\nRow14:1\u2192 no\nRow15:2\u2192 yes, one player.\nRow16:49\u2192 no\nRow17:30\u2192 no\nRow18:1\u2192 no\nRow19:1\u2192 no\nWait, row 19 is apps=1? Or did I miscount?\n\nWait, let me recount the rows correctly. There are 20 rows (indices 0-19). Let me list each row's \"apps\" value:\n\n0:3\n1:1\n2:34\n3:7\n4:65\n5:34\n6:40\n7:18\n8:39\n9:20\n10:59\n11:46\n12:47\n13:28\n14:1\n15:2\n16:49\n17:30\n18:1\n19: ?\n\nWait, perhaps I missed the last rows. Let me ensure:\n\nRow 15: apps=2\nRow 16:49\nRow17:30\nRow18:1\nRow19: ? (I think that's all; maybe row19 is not present). So only one player has 2 appearances.\n\nWait, but in the initial data provided, perhaps I missed a row. Let me recount:\n\nLooking back at the JSON structure, it's clear there are multiple players, each with their \"apps\" value.\n\nAfter reviewing all rows, I found that Row15 is the only player with apps=2. So only one player has exactly 2 appearances, which contradicts the second part of the claim that says \"though 2 have 2.\"\n\nWait a minute\u2014am I sure? Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at row indices:\nRow0:3\nRow1:1\nRow2:34\nRow3:7\nRow4:65\nRow5:34\nRow6:40\nRow7:18\nRow8:39\nRow9:20\nRow10:59\nRow11:46\nRow12:47\nRow13:28\nRow14:1\nRow15:2\nRow16:49\nRow17:30\nRow18:1\nRow19: ?\n\nWait, perhaps row19 is another player with apps=2? Or maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assessment. Let me list all \"apps\" values:\n\n- 3\n- 1\n-34\n-7\n-65\n-34\n-40\n-18\n-39\n-20\n-59\n-46\n-47\n-28\n-1\n-2\n-49\n-30\n-1\n\nWait, that's 19 rows. So the last row is row18 with apps=1.\n\nSo in total, how many players have apps=1? Rows 1,14,18 \u2192 three players with 1 appearance. That means the first part of the claim (\"nobody have only 1\") is false because there are three players with exactly 1 appearance.\n\nFor the second part, how many have apps=2? Only row15: one player. So the claim says \"though 2 have 2,\" which is incorrect as only one does.\n\nWait, but in my initial assessment, I thought the user might be confused between \"appearances\" and another metric, perhaps \"goals.\" Let me check if the claim was about goals instead of appearances. But no, the claim explicitly mentions appearances.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to total appearances across all seasons, but that would require summing each player's appearances across their career, which complicates things. However, given the data structure, it seems each row represents a single season for a player, so \"apps\" is per season. Therefore, the claim is about appearances in each season.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key points are:\n\n- There are multiple players with 1 appearance (at least three), which invalidates the first part of the claim.\n- Only one player has exactly 2 appearances, so the second part is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are false based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"nobody have only 1 appearance on this team, though 2 have 2 appearances\" is false. There are three players with exactly 1 appearance and only one player with exactly 2 appearances.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:** The table includes columns such as \"season,\" \"apps\" (appearances), \"goals,\" and \"nationality.\" We focus on the \"apps\" column to determine the number of appearances per player.\n\n2. **Analyze Each Part of the Claim:**\n   - **Part 1:** \"Nobody has only 1 appearance.\"\n     - Scanning through the \"apps\" values, we find that rows 1, 14, and 18 have 1 appearance each. Therefore, there are three players with exactly 1 appearance.\n   - **Part 2:** \"Though 2 have 2 appearances.\"\n     - Checking for \"apps\" equal to 2, only row 15 has this value. Thus, only one player has exactly 2 appearances.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both parts of the claim are incorrect as per the data provided. There are multiple players with 1 appearance and only one player with 2 appearances.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false; there are three players with 1 appearance and one player with 2 appearances.",
