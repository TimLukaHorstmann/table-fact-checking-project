    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to check if the claim is true or false based on the data provided. The claim says: \"the lowest championship score be a tie between john jackson and webb heintzelman at 205\". \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find where John Jackson and Webb Heintzelman are mentioned and see what their scores were.\n\nLooking at the table, let's start from the top. I'm scanning each row for these two names. \n\nI found John Jackson in row 26 (0-based index is 26 because counting starts from 0). The year is 1980, his score was 205. So that's one of them.\n\nNext, searching for Webb Heintzelman, I find him in row 30 (year 1988). His score is also 205. \n\nWait a minute, but looking further down, there are other entries with scores around 205 as well. For example, John Fiedler in 1984 has 206, Fred Funk in 1984 has 206, and so on. So the lowest score seems to be 205.\n\nBut I should check if there are any scores lower than 205. Let me go through each row's score column:\n\n- The earliest entries (before Thorny Lea) have higher scores, like in 1977 it's 209.\nLooking at the latter part of the table where it switches to Thorny Lea Golf Club starting from 1980 onwards:\n- 1980: 205\n- 1981: 210\n- 1982: 213\n- 1983: 214\n- 1984: 206\n- 1985: 211\n- 1986: 209\n- 1987: 210\n- 1988: 205\n- 1989: 210\n- 1990: 205\nWait, in row index 32 (year 1990), Steve Gotsche has a score of 205. That's another person with the same low score.\n\nSo, John Jackson in 1980 and Webb Heintzelman in 1988 both have 205, but so does Steve Gotsche in 1990. So it's not just a tie between two people; there are three individuals with that score. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it says it's a tie between only those two, but actually, there are more.\n\nWait no, let me double-check. The claim says \"a tie between john jackson and webb heintzelman at 205\". It doesn't mention Steve Gotsche, so according to the table, John Jackson (1980) and Webb Heintzelman (1988) both have 205. But in 1990, Steve Gotsche also has 205. So that's three people with the same score. Therefore, the claim is only partially correct; there are more than two tied at 205.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the table. Let me check again:\n\n- John Jackson: row index 26, score 205.\n- Webb Heintzelman: row index 30, score 205.\n- Steve Gotsche: row index 32, score 205.\n\nSo three people have the same lowest score of 205. Therefore, the claim that it's a tie between only John and Webb is incorrect because there's another person with the same score. Hence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the lowest championship score is tied between John Jackson and Webb Heintzelman at 205. However, upon reviewing the data, Steve Gotsche also achieved a score of 205 in 1990. This means there are three individuals with the same lowest score, making the claim incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\nThe relevant cells include the scores for John Jackson (row 26), Webb Heintzelman (row 30), and Steve Gotsche (row 32).\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the data provided in the table. The claim states: \"the highest championship score be 284 by Steve Brady in 1993.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim is referring to. It mentions a \"highest championship score,\" which I assume refers to the maximum score achieved in some kind of championship event. The score given is 284, and it's attributed to Steve Brady in the year 1993.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are several columns: Year, Player Name, Course Name, Location, Score. So, I need to check if there's a row where the Player Name is Steve Brady, the Year is 1993, and the Score is 284.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to find the year 1993. Let me go through the rows one by one:\n\n- The first few rows are from years around 2020, like 2023, 2022, etc., down to 1980s and earlier.\n  \nWhen I reach the row for 1993, let's see what it says. \n\nLooking at the table data provided:\n\n- For 1993: The player is Steve Brady, course name is Thorny Lea Golf Club in Brockton, Massachusetts, with a score of 284.\n\nSo, that matches part of the claim\u2014the player, year, and location. But wait, I need to check if this is indeed the highest score in the entire table. \n\nTo verify if 284 is the highest score, I have to look through all the scores across all years to find any higher than 284.\n\nLooking at other rows:\n\n- In 1993: Steve Brady with 284.\n- Other entries like 205, 206, up to 283 in some cases. For example, in 1991, Kim Thompson has a score of 278, and in 1990, Steve Gotsche scored 205.\n\nWait, but then there's an entry for 1993 with a score of 284, which seems higher than others. Let me check if any other year has a higher score than 284.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- The highest scores I see are in the 200s and 270s, but nothing above 284. For instance, in 1993, it's 284, and another entry in 1992 isn't listed here, but from what's provided, 284 seems to be the highest.\n\nSo, based on this table, Steve Brady did have a score of 284 in 1993, which appears to be the highest score recorded. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Player Name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine if the claim \"bruce zabriski score 282 at pga national golf club, haig & champion course\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to:\n\n1. **Player Name**: Bruce Zabriscki\n2. **Score**: 282\n3. **Golf Club**: PGA National Golf Club\n4. **Course(s)**: Haig & Champion\n\nLooking at the table, it has rows with information about different players, their scores, and the courses they played.\n\nI'll start by searching for \"Bruce Zabriscki\" in the player's name column (Column C). Scanning through the rows:\n\n- The earliest entries are from 2018 to 2005, but as I go down, I find a row where the player is \"Bruce Zabriski\". Let me check that.\n\nI found Bruce Zabriski in Row 33 (assuming the first data row is index 0). The details are:\n\n- **Player**: Bruce Zabriski\n- **Score**: 282\n- **Golf Club**: PGA National Golf Club, Haig & Champion\n\nThis matches exactly with the claim. So each part of the claim is supported by this single row.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells are relevant for verifying the claim. The claim mentions three things: player name, score, and course. Therefore, the relevant columns are:\n\n1. **Player**: Column C\n2. **Score**: Column D\n3. **Golf Club**: Column B\n\nSo, each of these cells in Row 33 will be the relevant_ cells.\n\nSince all parts of the claim match the data in this row, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"Player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"Golf Club\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me check the rows properly.\n\nLooking more carefully:\nRow index 24: Year 1990\nRow index 25: 1991? Wait, let's see:\n\nThe table is in order from 2023 down to 1977.

Let me recount.\n\nThe table data starts with rows in order from 2023 down to 1977. So row 0 is 2023, row 1: 2022,... up to row N being 1977.\n\nWait, looking back at the JSON structure, the \"table\" array has elements starting from 2023 down:\n\n[\n  {\"Year\": \"2023\", ...},\n  ...\n]\n\nSo for example, row 0 is 2023, row 1 is 2022, etc., until the last rows which are earlier years.\n\nWait no, looking at the data provided:\n\nThe table array starts with:\n\n{\n  \"Year\": \"2023\",\n  \"Player\": \"...\",\n  ...\n},\n...\nAnd towards the end, we have rows like:\n{\n  \"Year\": \"1978\",\n  \"Player\": \"Larry Griffin\",\n  \"Location\": \"thorny lea golf club\",\n  \"City_State\": \"brockton , massachusetts\",\n  \"Score\": \"209\"\n},\n...\n\nSo each row is a separate entry.

The claim is that \"the highest championship score be a tie between Robert Thompson and Mike West at 211.\" I need to verify if this claim is true or false based on the provided data table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the data. Each row in the table represents a year with details about the champion, their score, and other information. The relevant columns for this claim are likely \"Year,\" \"Champion,\" and \"Score.\" \n\nI need to find if Robert Thompson and Mike West both have a score of 211 in any given year. Let me scan through each row looking for these names and their corresponding scores.\n\nStarting from the top, I see that in 1985, John Fiedler scored 211 at Thorny Lea Golf Club. That's one instance of a score of 211. Moving down, in 1986, Robert Thompson also has a score of 211 at the same club. Then, looking further down, Mike West is listed in 1989 with a score of 210. Wait, that's not 211. So, Mike West's score isn't matching 211.\n\nContinuing through the table, I don't find any other instances where Robert Thompson or Mike West have a score of 211 except for Robert in 1986 and John Fiedler in 1985. Therefore, the claim that both Robert Thompson and Mike West tied at 211 is incorrect because Mike West didn't achieve that score.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the relevant cells are from the rows where either Robert Thompson or Mike West appear with a score of 211. Specifically:\n\n- Row 4 (1985) has John Fiedler with a score of 211.\n- Row 33 (1986) shows Robert Thompson with 211.\n\nSince Mike West doesn't have a score of 211, the claim isn't fully supported.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"all scores from 1996 - 2013 be at courses in port st lucie, florida\" is true based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that every score between the years 1996 and 2013 occurred at a course located in Port St Lucie, Florida. So, my task is to check each row in the table where the year falls within this range (1996-2013) and verify if the corresponding course location is indeed Port St Lucie, Florida.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has columns: Year, Player, Score, Course, Location. So, for each relevant row, I need to check two things: the year and the location.\n\nI'll start by identifying which rows fall within the years 1996-2013. Scanning through the data:\n\n- The table starts in 1977 and goes up to 2013. So, from row 0 to row 41 (assuming each row is consecutive starting from 0), I need to find all rows where Year >=1996 and <=2013.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Row indexes: Let's see. The first row after 1977 is 1978, so let me count up:\n\nRow 0: 1977\nRow 1: 1978\n...\nWait, actually, looking back, the table starts at the bottom with older years and goes up to 2013. Wait no, in the provided data, the rows are ordered from top (earlier years) to bottom (later years). So row 0 is 1977, row 1 is 1978, ..., row 41 would be 2013.\n\nWait, let me count how many rows there are. From 1977 up to 2013 is 36 entries (since 2013-1977+1=37 years). But the data shows more than that because each year has a separate row. Let's recount:\n\nLooking at the data, it starts with 1977 and ends with 2013. So from 1977 to 2013 is 36 years (since 2013-1977=36). But in the table, each year has one row except for some that have two rows, like 2004 with two entries.\n\nWait no, looking at the data again, it seems that each row represents a single tournament or event. So some years might have multiple entries because there were multiple tournaments in those years where the player won. For example, in 2013, there are two rows: one for Hideki Matsuyama and another for Adam Scott.\n\nSo to find all rows between 1996 and 2013 inclusive, I need to go through each row and check if the Year is within that range.\n\nOnce I identify those rows, I then check the Location column. If all of them are Port St Lucie, Florida, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nLet me start checking:\n\nStarting from 1996:\n- Looking through the table, row for 1996: not immediately visible in the provided data snippet, but assuming that between 1977 and 2013, all rows are included. Alternatively, perhaps I can check each relevant year.\n\nWait, let me go step by step:\n\nLooking at the data provided:\n\n- The first few rows are from 2014 down to earlier years, but in the table provided, it's ordered from top (earlier) to bottom (later). Wait no, looking at the structure, the data starts with row 0 as 1977 and goes up to row 41 as 2013.\n\nWait, I think I might have misread earlier. Let me correct that: in the JSON provided, the \"data\" array has rows from 1977 (row index 0) up to 2013 (the last entry). So each row is a year, but some years have multiple entries if there were multiple winners or tournaments.\n\nSo first, I need to collect all rows where Year >=1996 and <=2013.\n\nLet's go through the data:\n\nRow indices from 0 to let's say 41 (since 2013-1977=36 years plus some extra due to multiple entries per year).\n\nLooking for the first occurrence of 1996: I'll scan down until I find rows with Year 1996.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to note that in the provided data, the last few rows are from 2013. Let me check:\n\nThe last row is 2013, Location: Augusta, Georgia. So right there, that's a location not in Port St Lucie. But wait, the claim says \"all scores from 1996-2013\" were at Port St Lucie. If any of those are elsewhere, it's false.\n\nBut let me confirm:\n\nIn row data for 2013: two entries, both with Locations: Augusta, Georgia and also another location? Wait no, looking back:\n\nWait the last entry is \"Augusta, Georgia\" in 2013. So that alone would make the claim false because it's not Port St Lucie.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I need to check all years between 1996-2013.\n\nLet me look for any row within this period where Location is not Port St Lucie, Florida.\n\nLooking through the data:\n\nFor example, in 2014 (row index 45?), but wait no, since our upper limit is 2013. So perhaps rows before that.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused with row indices. Let me approach differently: for each year between 1996 and 2013 inclusive, check all corresponding Location entries.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- For example, in 2004 (row index let's say around 28), there are two rows: one at Pinehurst, North Carolina. So that would be a location outside Port St Lucie.\n\nWait no, wait. Let me check specific years:\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 23: 1996, Location: Augusta, Georgia.\n\nSo that's within 1996-2013 and not in Port St Lucie. Therefore, the claim is false because at least one score (in 1996) was at a course elsewhere.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm miscounting the row indices. Let me recount:\n\nStarting from row 0: 1977\nRow 1: 1978\n...\nRow 23 would be 1977 + 23 = 2000? Wait no, that's incorrect because each row is a separate entry, not necessarily one per year. So the years are spread out with multiple rows per year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for any row where Year is between 1996-2013 and Location is not Port St Lucie.\n\nLooking through:\n\nRow data entries:\n\n- The first few rows (top) are older years; as we go down, the years increase. So looking near the end of the table (around 2013), but let's check some key points.\n\nFor example, in 2004, there is a row with Location: Pinehurst, North Carolina. That would be within 1996-2013 and not Port St Lucie, so that alone makes the claim false.\n\nBut wait, I'm looking at the data provided, which might have limited entries. Let me check:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow index 45: Year 2013, Location Augusta, Georgia.\nRow index 46: Another 2013 entry, Location Augusta, Georgia.\nSo both are not Port St Lucie.\n\nSimilarly, in 2004 (row indices around there), locations like Pinehurst, NC appear.\n\nTherefore, multiple rows within the specified year range have Locations outside of Port St Lucie, Florida. Hence, the claim is false because not all scores from 1996-2013 were at courses in Port St Lucie.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that all scores from 1996 to 2013 occurred at courses in Port St Lucie, Florida, is false. There are multiple instances within this period where the location was elsewhere, such as Augusta, Georgia, and Pinehurst, North Carolina.\n\n**Answer:** False",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the lowest championship score be 206 by fred funk in 1984\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components:\n- The lowest championship score is 206.\n- This score was achieved by Fred Funk.\n- The year this happened was 1984.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row in the table to check these details.\n\nLooking at the rows, there are multiple entries from different years. The relevant columns here would be 'Year', 'Player Name', and 'Score'.\n\nI'll search for Fred Funk in the Player Name column. Scanning through the rows, I find Fred Funk listed under 1984. Checking his score, it's 206. So, that matches the claim.\n\nNext, I need to ensure that this is indeed the lowest score. To confirm this, I'll review all scores in the table to see if any are lower than 206. \n\nReviewing each row:\n- The scores range from around 205 up to higher numbers.\n- The lowest score I see is 205 in some years and 206 in 1984.\nWait, so Fred Funk's score of 206 isn't the absolute lowest because there are entries with 205. For example, Steve Gotsche scored 205 in 1990, Mike West also had a 205 in 1989, and others as well.\n\nThis means that while Fred Funk did score 206 in 1984, it's not the lowest because there are lower scores recorded. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\n**Answer:** FALSE  \nThe table shows that Fred Funk scored 206 in 1984, but there are lower scores listed (e.g., 205). Hence, the claim isn't fully accurate.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Player Name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to verify the claim: \"bruce zabriski score 284 at thorny lea golf club\". Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for Bruce Zabriski in the table. Scanning through each row's player names, I see that most entries are from different clubs and years. For example, starting from recent years like 2015 down to older ones, but not seeing Bruce Zabriski there. Wait, actually looking at the data provided, it starts from 2015 and goes back to 1977, right?\n\nWait, no\u2014looking again, the data seems to have a lot of entries, some with \"thorny lea golf club\" as the course. Let me check each row where the course is \"thorny lea golf club\". That's from 2015 down, but wait no\u2014the table provided actually starts from what looks like 2015 going back to 1977, with multiple entries for different courses.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me reorganize: the data structure is an array of rows, each representing a year and some other details. Each row has \"Year\", \"Player\", \"Course\", \"Location\", and \"Score\".\n\nSo to verify the claim, I need three pieces of information:\n\n1. Player's name: Bruce Zabriski\n2. Course: thorny lea golf club\n3. Score: 284\n\nI'll go through each row to see if any match all these criteria.\n\nStarting from the first entry in the table (which is actually 2015), I check each row:\n\n- The first few entries are at \"thorny lea golf club\" but the players there are names like Mike West, Webb Heintzelman, etc., and scores around 205-214. Not Bruce Zabriski.\n\nLooking further down, for example, in 1983: Victor Tortorici with a score of 214 at thorny lea. Nope.\n\nWait, but in the data provided, I don't see any entry where the player is Bruce Zabriski. Let me check all rows again:\n\nLooking through each row's \"Player\" column, none have \"Bruce Zabriski\". The closest might be \"Victor Tortorici\", but that's different.\n\nWait a minute\u2014the claim says he scored 284 at thorny lea golf club. But in the table, scores at thorny lea are all much lower: around 205-214. So even if Bruce were there, scoring 284 would be way higher than any other score in that course.\n\nMoreover, I don't see any row where the player is Bruce Zabriski, regardless of the course or year. Therefore, the claim can't be supported by the data provided.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be verified as there's no entry for Bruce Zabriski in the table, and scores at \"thorny lea golf club\" are much lower than 284.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "claim": "there be 3 championship score at bockton , massachusetts in 1991 - 1994",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. The user has provided a table with data about golf championships, including the year, winner, location, course, and score. They also made a claim: \"there be 3 championship score at Brockton, Massachusetts in 1991 - 1994.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems they're stating that there were three championships held at Brockton, MA between 1991 and 1994. So, my task is to check if this is true by looking at the relevant data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has columns like Year, Winner, Course, Location, and Score. The claim mentions the location as \"Brockton, MA\" and a range of years from 1991 to 1994. So I need to find all entries where Location is Brockton, MA and the Year falls within that range.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row in the table. Let me go year by year:\n\n- 1980: Location is Brockton, MA\n- 1981: Same location\n- ...\nContinuing this way until I reach the years mentioned in the claim.\n\nLooking at the years from 1991 to 1994:\n- 1990: Steve Gotsche, Thorny Lea Golf Club, Brockton, MA, score 205\nWait, that's 1990, which is before 1991. So not relevant.\nNext is 1991: Kim Thompson, same course and location, score 278. That's within the range.\n\nThen:\n- 1992: Steve Gotsche again? Wait, no, looking at the data provided, I think there might be a mix-up. Let me check each row properly.\n\nWait, actually, in the data provided, the years after 1980 go up to 1991 and then jump back. Hmm, perhaps I need to look more carefully.\n\nLooking again:\n\nFrom the table, the entries are from 1977 up to 2016 or so, but when looking at the specific range of 1991-1994, let me find those rows.\n\nI see:\n- 1989: Mike West, Brockton\n- 1990: Steve Gotsche, Brockton\n- 1991: Kim Thompson, Brockton\nThen the next entries are for 1992? Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the data provided, after 1991 (row index 34), the next years are:\n- Row 35: 1990, which is earlier.\nHmm, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table isn't sorted correctly? No, the user's JSON shows a list of rows from top to bottom as Year descending? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the data, the first row in the table (index 0) is 2016, then 2015, down to earlier years. So when I'm looking for 1991-1994, I need to find rows where Year is between those values.\n\nSo I'll go through each row:\n\nRow index 0: 2016\n...\nI need to skip until I reach the relevant years.\n\nLooking at the data provided by the user, let me list out the years and their corresponding locations:\n\n- Row 47: 1980, Brockton\n- Row 46: 1981, Brockton\n...\nWait, perhaps it's easier to go from the bottom up since the table is ordered from most recent to older.\n\nLooking for years between 1991 and 1994:\n\nRow index 35: Year 1990 - before range.\nRow 36: 1989\n...\nWait, I think I'm getting confused because the rows are in descending order. So row 0 is 2016, row 1 is 2015, etc., down to row 47 which is 1980.\n\nSo to find years between 1991-1994, I need to look for rows where Year is >=1991 and <=1994.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow index 3: 2013 (no)\n...\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to list all entries with Location as Brockton, MA and see their years.\n\nFrom the data, looking at each row's \"Location\" column:\n\nRows where Location is Brockton, MA include:\n- Row 47: 1980\n- Row 46: 1981\n- Row 45: 1982\n...\nContinuing up until:\nRow 35: 1990\nRow 36: 1989 (Brockton)\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the indices.\n\nAlternatively, let me look for rows where Location is Brockton, MA and Year between 1991-1994.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nStarting from the top (2016) going down:\n- Row 3: 2013, Florida\n...\nI'll skip until I find a row with Location as Brockton, MA in the years 1991-1994.\n\nLooking at row index 35: Year 1990, Location Brockton. That's before 1991.\nRow 36: Year 1989, same location.\n...\nWait, maybe I'm not finding any entries in 1991-1994 for Brockton.\n\nWait, looking again at the data provided by the user:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow index 0: 2016\n...\nI think I need to check each row's Year and Location.\n\nAfter checking all rows, it seems that the entries for Brockton, MA are from 1980 up to 1990. There are no entries between 1991-1994 with Location as Brockton, MA.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because there were not three championships in Brockton during that period; instead, the last one was in 1990.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if there were three golf championships at Brockton, Massachusetts between 1991 and 1994, we'll examine the provided data.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We need to find entries where:\n     - **Location:** Brockton, MA\n     - **Year:** Between 1991 and 1994 (inclusive)\n\n2. **Scan Through the Table:**\n   - The table lists golf championships in descending order of years from 2016 down to 1977.\n\n3. **Check for Entries in Brockton, MA During 1991\u20131994:**\n   - Going through each row:\n     - **1991:** Kim Thompson, Thorny Lea Golf Club, Brockton, MA (Score: 278)\n     - **1992:** No entry found for Brockton, MA\n     - **1993:** No entry found for Brockton, MA\n     - **1994:** No entry found for Brockton, MA\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Only **one** championship was held in Brockton, MA during the specified period (1991\u20131994), not three.\n\n### Answer:\nThere is only one golf championship listed at Brockton, Massachusetts between 1991 and 1994.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{1}",
