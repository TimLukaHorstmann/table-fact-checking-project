I need to determine whether the claim \"guillermo franco have a lower goal on march 1 2006 than october 8 2005\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: goal, date, venue, score, result, competition. Each row represents a match with details about that match.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific dates: March 1, 2006, and October 8, 2005. I need to find the corresponding rows in the table for these dates.\n\nLooking through the data:\n- The first row has the date \"8 october 2005\". So that's one match.\n- The second row has the date \"1 march 2006\", which is the other date mentioned.\n\nNow, I need to check the 'goal' column for both these rows. Wait a minute\u2014the claim mentions Guillermo Franco having goals on these dates. However, looking at the table provided, there's no column that specifies individual players or their goals. The columns are about the match's overall score and result, not individual player statistics.\n\nSo, the table doesn't have information about how many goals Guillermo Franco scored in each of those matches. Without this data, I can't verify whether he had a lower goal count on March 1 than October 8.\n\nTherefore, based on the given table, there's no way to support or refute the claim. Since the claim isn't supported by the available data, it must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"guillermo franco have the same score on march 1 2006 and june 10 , 2009\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided in JSON format. The columns are \"goal\", \"date\", \"venue\", \"score\", \"result\", and \"competition\". There are seven rows of data.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific dates: March 1, 2006, and June 10, 2009. I need to check if these dates exist in the table and find the corresponding scores for Guillermo Franco on those dates.\n\nLooking at the \"date\" column:\n- Row 1 (index 1): Date is March 1, 2006.\n- Row 3 (index 2): Date is June 10, 2009. Wait, actually, looking closer: The second row in data corresponds to index 1, which is the first data row after index 0. Let me recount:\nThe table has seven data rows, indexed from 0 to 6.\n\nLooking at each row's date:\n\nRow 0: October 8, 2005\nRow 1: March 1, 2006 \u2192 This matches the first date in the claim.\nRow 2: June 10, 2009 \u2192 Yes, this is the second date mentioned.\n\nSo for each of these rows (index 1 and index 2), I need to check the \"score\" column.\n\nLooking at row 1 (index 1):\n- The score is listed as \"1 - 0\".\n\nRow 2 (index 2):\n- The score is also \"1 - 0\".\n\nWait, but I should be careful here. The claim mentions Guillermo Franco's score on those dates. However, the table doesn't have a column specifically for players; it only has \"score\", which likely refers to the match score between two teams.\n\nSo, if both matches had the same score of 1-0, then the claim would be TRUE because both scores are the same. But wait, looking again:\n\nRow 1 (index 1): The result is \"1 - 0\" in the \"score\" column.\nRow 2 (index 2): The result is also \"1 - 0\".\n\nBut I should confirm if the claim refers to the match score or something else. Since the table doesn't have individual player stats, just the overall match scores.\n\nTherefore, both dates have a score of 1-0, so the claim that the scores are the same is TRUE.\n\nWait, but looking back at row 2 (index 2), I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check:\n\nRow indices:\n\nThe data array has seven elements, each representing a row starting from index 0.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 0: \"8 october 2005\"\nRow 1: \"1 march 2006\" \u2192 This is March 1, 2006. The score here is \"1 - 0\".\nRow 2: \"10 june 2009\" \u2192 June 10, 2009. Score is \"1 - 0\".\n\nSo both rows have the same score of 1-0.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Guillermo Franco had the same score on those dates would be TRUE if we assume that the score refers to the match result. However, since the table doesn't specify individual player scores, only team scores, it's a bit ambiguous. But given the information available, both matches have the same score.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE, with relevant cells being the \"score\" column in rows 1 and 2.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"guillermo franco have the same type of competition on goal 2 and goal 7\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the table provided in JSON format. The columns are: goal, date, venue, score, result, competition. There are seven rows of data, each representing a different match with details like when it happened, where, and what the outcome was.\n\nThe claim is about Guillermo Franco having the same type of competition for goals 2 and 7. But wait, I don't see any mention of \"guillermo franco\" in the table at all. The data seems to be about matches, possibly soccer matches, with details like scores and competitions but no player names listed.\n\nWait a second, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the term \"goal\" here refers to the row index or something else? Let me check: In the data array, each sub-array starts with a number under the \"goal\" column. So goal 2 is the second row (index 1) and goal 7 would be the seventh row (index 6), but looking at the indexes, wait, no\u2014rows are zero-based or one-based? Let me clarify: The first data entry has goal=1, which is index 0 in programming terms. So goal 2 would be row index 1, and goal 7 is beyond the provided data since there are only seven rows (indices 0-6). Wait no\u2014the seventh row is index 6 with goal=7.\n\nSo for goal 2: Looking at row index 1. The competition here is \"friendly\". For goal 7: It's row index 6, which has a competition of \"friendly\" as well.\n\nBut the claim mentions Guillermo Franco, who isn't present in any of these rows. So does that affect the truth? Because if the claim is about someone not mentioned, how can we verify it?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the person's name is irrelevant because the table doesn't include player names. The question is whether for goals 2 and 7, the competition type is the same.\n\nLooking again: Goal 2 (row index 1) has competition \"friendly\", and goal 7 (row index 6) also has competition \"friendly\". So yes, both are friendly competitions.\n\nTherefore, the claim's assertion about the competition types being the same is TRUE. But since Guillermo Franco isn't in the table, perhaps the claim is misinformed? Wait, no\u2014because the table doesn't mention players, just matches. So maybe the claim refers to someone else not present here, making it impossible to verify. Alternatively, perhaps the name \"guillermo franco\" is a red herring and irrelevant because the table lacks that information.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I should check each condition against the table. The relevant cells are goal 2 and 7's competition types. Since both competitions are \"friendly\", the claim about them being the same holds true regardless of whether Guillermo Franco is involved or not, because the table doesn't provide any info on players.\n\nWait, but if the claim is making a statement that connects Guillermo Franco to these goals, then without his presence in the data, maybe it's impossible to confirm. However, perhaps the claim is just about the competition types for goal 2 and 7, regardless of who scored them. The name might be irrelevant.\n\nI think I should focus on what's stated: whether the competitions are the same type. Since both are \"friendly\", the answer is TRUE. The mention of Guillermo Franco may not affect this since the table doesn't include player info.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine whether the claim \"guillermo franco score goal 4 and 5 at the same 2009 concacaf gold cup competition\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I should examine the table structure. The columns are: goal, date, venue, score, result, and competition. Each row represents a different match with specific details filled under these headers.\n\nLooking at the claim, it mentions two goals (goal 4 and 5) scored by Guillermo Franco in the same 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup competition. So, I need to check if both goal 4 and 5 are from this competition and if they were part of the same match.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1 (goal 1):** Competition is \"2006 FIFA World Cup qualification.\" Not relevant.\n2. **Row 2 (goal 2):** Competition is \"friendly.\" Not relevant.\n3. **Row 3 (goal 3):** Competition is \"2010 FIFA World Cup qualification.\" Not relevant.\n4. **Row 4 (goal 4):** The competition here is \"2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup.\"\n   - Looking at the score, it's \"5 - 3 (pso)\". I need to check if this row mentions Guillermo Franco scoring a goal. However, the table only lists \"score\" and \"result,\" not individual scorers.\n5. **Row 5 (goal 5):** Also under \"2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup.\"\n   - The score here is \"0 - 5\". Again, no mention of individual goalscorers.\n\nSo both goal 4 and 5 are from the same competition as per rows 4 and 5. However, the table doesn't provide information about which player scored these goals. Without explicit data on who scored each goal, I can't confirm that Guillermo Franco was the scorer for both goals 4 and 5.\n\nAdditionally, even if both goals were in the same competition, there's no indication they were in the same match. Goal 4 is from a game at Soldier Field with a result of \"5 - 3 (pso)\", whereas goal 5 is from Giants Stadium with a result of \"0 - 5.\" These are two different matches within the same competition.\n\nTherefore, while both goals are part of the same competition, there's insufficient data to confirm that Guillermo Franco scored both.

Since there's no data in the table about individual players' goals, I can't determine how many goals each player scored on those dates.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"guillermo franco have different score on march 1 2006 and june 10 , 2009\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions Guillermo Franco having different scores on two specific dates: March 1, 2006, and June 10, 2009. The table contains data about goals, dates, venues, scores, results, and competitions.\n\nI should look for the rows corresponding to these two dates in the table. \n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: Date is \"8 october 2005\" \u2013 not relevant.\n- Row 2: Date is \"1 march 2006\". This matches March 1, 2006.\n- The other rows are either before or after these dates except for row 3 which is June 10, 2009.\n\nSo, the relevant rows are row 2 and row 3 (assuming row indexing starts at 0? Wait no, in JSON the data array index starts at 0. So checking again:\n\nRow indices:\n0: Oct 8, 2005\n1: March 1, 2006\n2: June 10, 2009\n3: July 23, 2009\n4: July 26, 2009\n5: Sept 5, 2009\n6: May 24, 2010\n\nWait, the user's table data is given as an array with indexes from 0 to 6. So March 1, 2006 is row 1 (index 1), and June 10, 2009 is row 2 (index 2).\n\nLooking at the columns: \"score\" and \"result\". The claim mentions \"different score\", so I need to check the \"score\" column for these rows.\n\nFor March 1, 2006 (row 1): Score is \"1 - 0\".\nFor June 10, 2009 (row 2): Score is \"1 - 0\".\n\nSo both scores are the same. Therefore, the claim that Guillermo Franco has different scores on these dates is FALSE.\n\nWait, but wait: The table's data for row 2 (March 1, 2006) shows a score of \"1 - 0\" and result of \"1 - 0\". For June 10, 2009 (row 3), the score is \"1 - 0\" as well. So both scores are identical.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the scores are the same on both dates.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells: We need to check the \"score\" column for the two specific rows.\n\nSo row indices 1 and 2, but wait, in the data array:\n\nRow 0: Oct 8, 2005\nRow 1: March 1, 2006 (score is \"1 - 0\")\nRow 2: June 10, 2009 (score is \"1 - 0\")\n\nSo the relevant cells are row 1 and row 2 under the \"score\" column.\n\nThus, in JSON:\n\n\"relevant_cells\": [\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n]\n\nAnd answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a specific claim about the given table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"guillermo franco score goal at friendly competition the same amount as at 2009 concacaf gold cup.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions Guillermo Franco scoring goals in two different types of competitions: friendly matches and the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup. The claim states that he scored the same number of goals in both these competitions.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided in JSON format, I need to extract the relevant data to verify this claim. Let's break down the columns we have:\n\n- **goal**: This seems to be an identifier for each match, possibly indicating the sequence or a unique number.\n- **date**: The date when the match took place.\n- **venue**: Where the match was held.\n- **score**: The score of the match in terms of goals scored by each team.\n- **result**: The final outcome of the match, perhaps including extra-time or penalties if applicable.\n- **competition**: The type of competition this match was part of.\n\nThe key columns here are \"competition,\" \"score,\" and \"result\" because they relate to where the goals were scored (competition), who scored them (implied by the score), and how many goals were scored.\n\nNext, I need to identify all rows that fall under either \"friendly\" or \"2009 concacaf gold cup\" competitions. \n\nLooking through the data:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Competition is \"2006 FIFA World Cup qualification.\"\n   - Not relevant since it's not a friendly or Gold Cup.\n\n2. **Row 1**: Competition is \"friendly.\"\n   - Relevant for part of the claim.\n   - The score here is \"1 - 0,\" and the result is also \"1 - 0.\" Assuming this is the team's score, Guillermo Franco might have scored a goal here if he was on that team.\n\n3. **Row 2**: Competition is \"2010 FIFA World Cup qualification.\"\n   - Not relevant.\n\n4. **Row 3**: Competition is \"2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup.\"\n   - Relevant for the other part of the claim.\n   - The score is \"1 - 0,\" and the result includes a penalty shootout (5-3). So, the actual goals in the match were 1 each before penalties.\n\n5. **Row 4**: Competition is \"2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup.\"\n   - Relevant as well.\n   - The score is \"0 - 5\" and the result is also \"0 - 5.\" So, no goals scored by the team Guillermo Franco was on in this match.\n\n6. **Row 5**: Competition is \"2010 FIFA World Cup qualification.\"\n   - Not relevant.\n\n7. **Row 6**: Competition is \"friendly.\"\n   - Relevant for part of the claim.\n   - The score is \"2 - 1,\" and the result is \"3 - 1.\" So, two goals were scored by his team in this match.\n\nNow, let's analyze the number of goals Guillermo Franco might have scored in each competition type.\n\nStarting with **friendly competitions**:\n\n- Row 1: Score is \"1 - 0\" (team's score) and result is also \"1 - 0.\" So, one goal was scored by his team. Assuming he scored that goal.\n- Row 6: Score is \"2 - 1,\" result is \"3 - 1.\" His team scored two goals in this match. If Guillermo Franco scored both, or just one.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"score goal at friendly competition\" and \"the same amount as at 2009 concacaf gold cup.\" So, we need to count how many goals he scored in friendly matches versus the Gold Cup.\n\nLooking at Gold Cup competitions:\n\n- Row 3: Score is \"1 - 0,\" result includes penalties but actual goals were 1 each. So his team scored one goal.\n- Row 4: Score is \"0 - 5,\" so no goals from his team.\n\nSo in total, in the Gold Cup matches listed, his team scored one goal (Row 3) and zero in Row 4. So, total goals for Gold Cup would be one goal.\n\nIn friendly competitions:\n\n- Row 1: One goal.\n- Row 6: Two goals.\n\nSo total goals in friendly competitions would be three (assuming he scored all). But if only considering the number of matches or per match, it's unclear because we don't know how many goals he personally scored. The scores show team goals, not individual players.\n\nWait, the table doesn't specify which player scored the goals. It just shows the team's score. So, without knowing that Guillermo Franco was on the team and how many goals he scored in each match, we can't definitively say whether his personal goal counts were equal between friendly and Gold Cup competitions.\n\nBut perhaps the claim is referring to the number of matches where his team won or participated, but no, it's about goals. Alternatively, maybe it's about the total goals across all his appearances in those competitions.\n\nGiven that we don't have individual player stats, only team scores, it's impossible to determine how many goals Guillermo Franco personally scored in each competition. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the given data.\n\nWait, but let me re-examine the claim: \"guillermo franco score goal at friendly competition the same amount as at 2009 concacaf gold cup.\" The wording is a bit unclear. It could mean that he scored goals in the same number of matches (i.e., same count) or that the total number of goals he scored was equal.\n\nBut without knowing his individual contributions, we can't assess this. Alternatively, perhaps the team's goal tally is being used as a proxy for his goals, but that's an assumption.\n\nLooking back at the data:\n\n- In friendly competitions (Rows 1 and 6), his team scored 1 + 2 = 3 goals.\n- In Gold Cup competitions (Rows 3 and 4), his team scored 1 + 0 = 1 goal.\n\nSo if we assume that the number of goals he scored is proportional to the team's total, then it wouldn't be equal. However, this is a big assumption because other players could have scored those goals.\n\nTherefore, without specific player data, we cannot confirm whether the claim is true or false.\n</think>\n\nBased on the information provided in the table, we can identify the competitions and the corresponding results for \"friendly\" and \"2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup.\" \n\n- **Friendly Competitions**:\n  - Row 1: Result = 1\n  - Row 6: Result = 3 (with a score of 2)\n  \n- **2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup**:\n  - Row 3: Result = 5 (including penalties, but actual goals were 1 each before penalties)\n  - Row 4: Result = 0\n\nHowever, the table does not provide specific information about how many goals Guillermo Franco scored in these competitions. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine if he scored the same number of goals in both competition types.\n\n**Answer**: Based on the given data, it is impossible to confirm whether Guillermo Franco scored an equal number of goals in friendly competitions and the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup because individual player statistics are not provided.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"Guillermo Franco have the same type of competition on goal 1 and goal 6\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim refers to. The claim mentions \"goal 1\" and \"goal 6,\" which correspond to rows in the table with the respective goal numbers. Each row has several columns: goal, date, venue, score, result, and competition. The key here is the 'competition' column because the claim is about whether the type of competition is the same for both goals.\n\nLooking at the table data:\n\n- For goal 1 (row index 0), the competition is \"2006 fifa world cup qualification.\"\n- For goal 6 (row index 5), the competition is \"2010 fifa world cup qualification.\"\n\nWait, that's different. Goal 1 is for the 2006 World Cup qual, and goal 6 is for the 2010 World Cup qual. They are both FIFA World Cup qualifications but in different years. The claim says they have the \"same type of competition,\" which could be interpreted as whether it's the same competition or just the same kind.\n\nHowever, I should consider if 'competition' refers to the specific event or the general category. Since goal 1 is a qual for 2006 and goal 6 is for 2010, they are different competitions even though both are World Cup qualifications. Therefore, the types of competition are not the same in terms of their specific events.\n\nSo, the claim that Guillermo Franco has the same type of competition on goal 1 and goal 6 would be FALSE because one is for the 2006 qualification and the other for 2010. The relevant cells to check are the 'competition' column for both rows 0 and 5.\n\nI should also consider if there's any possibility that \"same type\" could mean the same general category, like both being World Cup qualifiers regardless of the year. But in this context, each competition entry is specific, so I think they're considered different based on the years.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to goals 1 and 6, checking their competitions. Goal 1's competition is \"2006 FIFA World Cup qualification,\" while goal 6's is \"2010 FIFA World Cup qualification.\" Since these are different specific competitions, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. I'm given a table in JSON format and a claim that I need to verify as TRUE or FALSE based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, the claim is: \"guillermo franco score goal 4 and 5 at the same 2010 concacaf gold cup competition.\" \n\nLooking at the table's columns: \"goal\", \"date\", \"venue\", \"score\", \"result\", \"competition\". So each row represents a match or game with various details.\n\nI need to check if Guillermo Franco scored goals number 4 and 5 in the same competition, which is the 2010 CONCACAF Gold Cup.\n\nWait, but looking at the data rows:\n\nRow indices go from 0 to 6. Let's list them out:\n\nRow 0: Competition is \"2006 FIFA World Cup qualification\".\nRow 1: Competition is \"friendly\".\nRow 2: Competition is \"2010 FIFA World Cup qualification\".\nRow 3: Competition is \"2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup\".\nRow 4: Same as Row 3, same competition.\nRow 5: Competition is \"2010 FIFA World Cup qualification\".\nRow 6: Competition is \"friendly\".\n\nSo the only entries for \"2010 CONCACAF Gold Cup\" are not present in this table. The closest is the 2009 edition.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions the \"2010 CONCACAF Gold Cup\". Looking at the data, I don't see any rows with that competition name. Rows 3 and 4 are part of the 2009 version, not 2010.\n\nTherefore, there's no data in this table about the 2010 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Hence, it's impossible for Guillermo Franco to have scored goals 4 and 5 in that competition as per the given data because those entries don't exist here.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I'm misreading the competitions. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: 2006 World Cup Qualification\nRow 1: friendly\nRow 2: 2010 World Cup Qualification\nRow 3: 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup\nRow 4: same as Row 3\nRow 5: 2010 World Cup Qualification again\nRow 6: friendly\n\nYes, no mention of 2010 CONCACAF Gold Cup. So the claim is about a competition not present in the table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the goal numbers. The \"goal\" column seems to be numbered from 1 to 7 across all rows. But each row represents a different match. For example:\n\nRow 0: Goal number 1\nRow 1: Goal number 2\nRow 2: Goal number 3\nRow 3: Goal number 4\nRow 4: Goal number 5\nRow 5: Goal number 6\nRow 6: Goal number 7\n\nSo goal 4 is in Row 3, which is the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Similarly, goal 5 is in Row 4, same competition.\n\nWait a minute! So both goals 4 and 5 are scored in the \"2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup\" competition, not 2010. The claim says they were at the same 2010 competition, which doesn't exist here. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because those goals were part of the 2009 edition, not 2010.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to goals in a 2010 competition that isn't listed. Goals 4 and 5 are from the 2009 Gold Cup.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"Guillermo Franco score goal at friendly competition the same amount as at 2010 FIFA World Cup competition.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe key parts are:\n1. Guillermo Franco scored goals in a friendly competition.\n2. He also scored goals in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification competitions.\n3. The number of goals he scored in both types of competitions is the same.\n\nBut looking at the table, I notice that there's no information about individual players or their goal contributions. Each row in the data represents a match with details like date, venue, score, result, and competition type. However, it doesn't specify who scored the goals.\n\nSince the table only gives the team scores (like 1-1, 5-2) without breaking down individual player statistics, I can't determine how many goals Guillermo Franco specifically scored in each competition. Without this information, I can't verify if both competitions had the same number of his goals.\n\nTherefore, the claim cannot be confirmed because there's no data about individual players' goal counts.\n</think>\n\nThe table lacks data on individual player goals, so we can't confirm if Guillermo Franco scored equally in friendly and 2010 World Cup qualifiers.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
