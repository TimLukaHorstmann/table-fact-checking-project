    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table data. The claim states: \"there be 8 game at the boston garden, all before december 17\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse what this means. It says there are eight games played at Boston Garden, and all of these games happened before December 17th. So, my task is to check how many games were held at Boston Garden in the table and whether each of those occurred before December 17.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see that each row has a \"location / attendance\" column which indicates where the game was played. The relevant rows would be those where this field mentions \"boston garden\". Additionally, I need to check the date for each of these games to ensure they all fall before December 17.\n\nI'll go through each entry in the data array:\n\n- Row 0: Game 20 on December 3 vs Philadelphia 76ers at Boston Garden. Date is Dec 3, which is before Dec 17.\n- Row 1: Game 21 on December 4 vs St Louis Hawks at St Louis Arena. Location isn't Boston Garden.\n- Row 2: Game 22 on December 5 vs Cincinnati Royals in Cincinnati. Not Boston Garden.\n- Row 3: Game 23 on December 7 vs St Louis Hawks in New York. Not Boston Garden.\n- Row 4: Game 24 on December 8 vs Los Angeles Lakers at Boston Garden. Date is Dec 8, before Dec 17.\n- Row 5: Game 25 on December 11 vs San Francisco Warriors at Boston Garden. Date is Dec 11, still before.\n- Row 6: Game 26 on December 15 vs Cincinnati Royals at Boston Garden. Dec 15 is also before Dec 17.\n- Row 7: Game 27 on December 17 vs Detroit Pistons in Detroit. Not Boston Garden and date is exactly Dec 17, which doesn't meet the 'before' condition.\n- Rows 8 to 13 (Games 28-33): I'll quickly check each location:\n   - Row 8: Boston Garden on Dec 22 \u2192 after Dec 17.\n   - Rows 9,10: Baltimore and Philadelphia games, so not Boston Garden.\n   - Row 11: December 28 vs Warriors at Providence. Not Boston Garden.\n\nSo, the games at Boston Garden are in rows 0,4,5,6, and also row 8 (but that's after Dec 17). Wait, let me recount:\n\nWait, row 8 is game 28 on December 22, which is after Dec 17. So, excluding that.\n\nSo the relevant games are rows 0 (Dec3),4(Dec8),5(Dec11),6(Dec15) \u2192 four games in total at Boston Garden before Dec17. But the claim says there were eight such games. That means the claim is incorrect because only four games meet both conditions.\n\nWait, but I might have missed some entries. Let me go through all rows again:\n\nRows 0: Boston Garden\nRow4: Boston Garden\nRow5: Boston Garden\nRow6: Boston Garden\nRow8: Boston Garden (Dec22 \u2192 after)\nAny others? Rows 1-3 and 7-13 don't have Boston Garden except for row8.\n\nSo, total of four games at Boston Garden before Dec17. The claim says eight, which is incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows only four games at Boston Garden before December 17, not eight as claimed.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location  / attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location  / attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location  / attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location  / attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
