The columns are name, years, regular season, playoffs, and total. So, for each player, we have their career years, goals in the regular season, goals in the playoffs, and total goals.\n\nThe claim is specifically about playoff goals. So I need to compare Bobby Hull's playoff goals with all other players listed.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Row 0: Bobby Hull has 62 playoff goals.\n- Row 1: Stan Mikita has 59.\n- Row 2: Steve Larmer has 45.\n- Row 3: Denis Savard has 61. Oh, wait that's higher than some others but not higher than Bobby Hull?\nWait no, 61 is less than 62?

Let me make sure no other player has more than 62.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\n- The second highest is Denis Savard with 61, then Stan Mikita with 59.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are name, years, regular season, playoffs, and total. So, each row represents a player with their respective stats in those categories. \n\nThe claim is about Bill Mosienko having the fewest postseason goals. Postseason here probably refers to the \"playoffs\" column since that's the closest term. So I should focus on the \"playoffs\" numbers for all players.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Bobby Hull has 62 playoff goals.\n2. Stan Mikita has 59.\n3. Steve Larmer has 45.\n4. Denis Savard has 61.\n5. Dennis Hull has 33.\n6. Jeremy Roenick has 35.\n7. Tony Amonte has 13.\n8. Hubert Pit Martin has 26.\n9. Bill Mosienko has 10.\n10. Ken Wharram has 16.\n\nNow, I need to find who has the fewest in playoffs. Scanning through these numbers: 10 is the lowest number here (Bill Mosienko). The next lowest are 13 (Tony Amonte), then 16, 26, 33, etc. So Bill Mosienko indeed has the fewest playoff goals with just 10.\n\nTo be thorough, I'll check each row's \"playoffs\" value again to ensure there's no lower number than 10. No other player has a number less than 10 in the playoffs column. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Bill Mosienko scored the fewest postseason goals. By examining the \"playoffs\" column, we find that Bill Mosienko has the lowest value of 10.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"playoffs\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"there be 398 goal separate the highest scorer from the lowest scorer.\" I need to determine if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim means. It seems to say that there is a difference of 398 goals between the highest and lowest scorers in the table. So, I need to find out who the highest scorer is and who the lowest scorer is, then calculate the difference between their total goals.\n\nLooking at the table columns: \"name\", \"years\", \"regular season\", \"playoffs\", \"total\". The relevant column for the total goals would be the \"total\" column.\n\nLet me go through each row to find the highest and lowest totals.\n\nRow 0: bobby hull, total is 666\nRow 1: stan mikita, total is 600\nRow 2: steve larmer, total is 451\nRow 3: denis savard, total is 438\nRow 4: dennis hull, total is 331\nRow 5: jeremy roenick, total is 302\nRow 6: tony amonte, total is 281\nRow 7: hubert pit martin, total is 269\nRow 8: bill mosienko, total is 268\nRow 9: ken wharram, total is 268\n\nSo the highest scorer is bobby hull with 666 goals. The lowest scorers are bill mosienko and ken wharram both with 268 goals.\n\nNow, let's calculate the difference between the highest and the lowest. 666 - 268 = 398. That matches exactly what the claim says.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are bobby hull's total (row 0) and both bill mosienko's and ken wharram's totals (rows 8 and 9). However, since the claim refers to the lowest scorer in general, I think including both of their rows would be necessary to confirm that they indeed have the same lowest total.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the JSON data. The columns are \"name\", \"years\", \"regular season\", \"playoffs\", and \"total\". So, for each player, there's a value under \"regular season\" which represents their regular-season goals.\n\nThe claim is about players who have scored more than 300 goals in the regular season. I need to check how many players meet this criterion.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Bobby Hull**: Regular season goals are 604. That's way above 300.\n2. **Stan Mikita**: 541 goals. Also well over 300.\n3. **Steve Larmer**: 406 goals. Again, more than 300.\n4. **Denis Savard**: 377 goals. Still above 300.\n5. **Dennis Hull**: 298 goals. Hmm, that's below 300.\n6. **Jeremy Roenick**: 267 goals. Also below.\n7. **Tony Amonte**: 268 goals. Below again.\n8. **Hubert Pit Martin**: 243 goals. Not enough.\n9. **Bill Mosienko**: 258 goals. Still under.\n10. **Ken Wharram**: 252 goals. Also below.\n\nSo, counting the players with more than 300 regular season goals: Bobby Hull (604), Stan Mikita (541), Steve Larmer (406), and Denis Savard (377).

So, each row represents a player with their respective statistics across these categories.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions Bobby Hull's playoff goals and whether he has the least among all Chicago Blackhawks players listed in the table. Therefore, I should focus on the \"playoffs\" column to compare each player's playoff goal count.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n1. Bobby Hull: 62 playoff goals.\n2. Stan Mikita: 59\n3. Steve Larmer: 45\n4. Denis Savard: 61\n5. Dennis Hull: 33\n6. Jeremy Roenick: 35\n7. Tony Amonte: 13\n8. Hubert Pit Martin: 26\n9. Bill Mosienko: 10\n10.

However, looking at the data:\n\n- Hubert Pit Martin has 26, which is less than Bobby's 62.\n- Bill Mosienko has 10, which is even lower.\n- Ken Wharram has 16, and Tony Amonte has just 13, which is the lowest in the table.\n\nSo, if we're comparing all these players, the lowest playoff goals are 13 by Tony Amonte. Therefore, Bobby Hull's 62 is not the least; it's actually one of the higher numbers.\n\nI need to make sure I'm considering all relevant cells. For each player, their \"playoffs\" value is crucial. So, I'll list each row index and the \"playoffs\" column for comparison.\n\nSo, Bobby Hull is in row 0 with 62, which isn't the least when compared to others like Tony Amonte (row 6) with 13.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I have a table in JSON format with some data about hockey players, and there's a claim made: \"bill mosienko and ken wharram have both scored the same total number of goals.\" My job is to determine whether this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. The columns are \"name\", \"years\", \"regular season\", \"playoffs\", and \"total\". Each row corresponds to a different player with their respective statistics across these categories. \n\nThe claim specifically mentions two players: Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram. It states that both have scored the same total number of goals. So, I need to find the rows corresponding to each of these players and look at their \"total\" column values.\n\nLooking through the data array:\n\n1. The first row is Bobby Hull.\n2. The second is Stan Mikita.\n3. Steve Larmer follows.\n4. Then Denis Savard.\n5. Dennis Hull comes next.\n6. Jeremy Roenick after that.\n7. Tony Amonte is next.\n8. Hubert Pit Martin.\n9. Bill Mosienko's row is the ninth one, with index 8 (since indexing starts at 0).\n10. Ken Wharram is in the tenth row, which would be index 9.\n\nSo, for each of these players, I need to check their \"total\" goals. The \"total\" column is the fifth element in each row array since the columns are ordered as name, years, regular season, playoffs, total. So the indexes go from 0 (name) to 4 (total).\n\nFor Bill Mosienko:\n- Row index 8.\n- Looking at the data: [258, 10, 268]. Wait, that seems a bit off because earlier columns are \"regular season\", \"playoffs\", and then \"total\". So in row 8, \"regular season\" is 243, playoffs 26, total 269. Wait, I think I might have miscounted. Let me double-check.\n\nWait no, looking back at the JSON:\n\nLooking at the ninth data entry (index 8):\n\n[\n   \"bill mosienko\",\n   \"1942  - 1955\",\n   258,\n   10,\n   268\n]\n\nSo here, regular season is 258, playoffs 10, total 268.\n\nSimilarly, for Ken Wharram:\n\n[\n   \"ken wharram\",\n   \"1952  - 1969\",\n   252,\n   16,\n   268\n]\n\nSo his regular season is 252, playoffs 16, total 268.\n\nWait a second. Both Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram have the same \"total\" of 268 goals. That's interesting because their individual regular season and playoff stats are different, but when combined, they both sum up to 268.\n\nTherefore, according to the data in the table, both players have scored the same total number of goals. \n\nSo, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So, each row represents a player's stats over their career in these categories.\n\nThe claim mentions Bill Mosienko scoring the most postseason goals with 33. Postseason is likely referred to by the \"playoffs\" column here because that seems like it would track playoff performance.\n\nLooking at the data rows, I need to find the row for Bill Mosienko. Scanning through, I see his entry is the ninth row in the data array. So, row index 8 (since indexing starts at 0). His playoffs value is 10 goals, not 33. That's one point against the claim.\n\nWait, but let me check other players to make sure that 33 isn't somewhere else. Scanning through all the playoff columns:\n\n- Bobby Hull: 62\n- Stan Mikita: 59\n- Steve Larmer: 45\n- Denis Savard: 61\n- Dennis Hull: 33\n- Jeremy Roenick: 35\n- Tony Amonte: 13\n- Hubert Pit Martin: 26\n- Bill Mosienko: 10\n- Ken Wharram: 16\n\nAh, I see that Dennis Hull has 33 playoff goals. So the claim actually refers to Dennis Hull, but it's attributed to Bill Mosienko. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo, Bill Mosienko didn't score 33 playoff goals; he only scored 10. Also, Dennis Hull did have 33, which is more than others except Bobby Hull (62) and Denis Savard (61). Wait, so actually, 62 is higher than 33. So even Dennis Hull isn't the highest.\n\nWait, but looking back: Bobby Hull has 62 playoff goals, Stan Mikita 59, Steve Larmer 45, Denis Savard 61, Dennis Hull 33, Jeremy Roenick 35, Tony Amonte 13, Hubert Pit Martin 26, Bill Mosienko 10, Ken Wharram 16.\n\nSo the highest is Bobby Hull with 62. So if someone claimed that Bill Mosienko scored the most with 33, that's false on two counts: he didn't score 33, and even if he did, it wouldn't be the most because others have higher numbers.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly attributes 33 playoff goals to Bill Mosienko when his actual count is 10.

So I need to find who has the highest and the lowest total goals and see if the difference is 20.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are name, years, regular season, playoffs, and total. The 'total' column seems to be the sum of regular season and playoffs. Let me check each row's total:\n\n1. Bobby Hull: 666\n2. Stan Mikita: 600\n3. Steve Larmer: 451\n4. Denis Savard: 438\n5. Dennis Hull: 331\n6. Jeremy Roenick: 302\n7. Tony Amonte: 281\n8. Hubert Pit Martin: 269\n9. Bill Mosienko: 268\n10. Ken Wharram: 268\n\nWait, the highest total is Bobby Hull with 666 goals. The lowest seems to be both Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram at 268 each. So, I need to calculate the difference between 666 and 268.\n\nLet me do that: 666 minus 268 equals... let's see, 666 - 200 is 466, then subtract another 68 gives 398. So the difference is 398 goals. But the claim says it's only a 20-goal difference. That doesn't match at all.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"highest scorer from the lowest scorer.\" Could they mean the top two? Let me see: The highest is Bobby with 666, then Stan Mikita with 600. The difference between them is 66 goals. Still not 20.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about the highest and the next highest in the same team or something else, but the table doesn't have information on teams. It just lists individual players' totals.\n\nLooking again at the numbers: 666 down to 268. The difference is definitely more than 20.

To verify this, I'll go through each row and check the \"regular season\" value.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Bobby Hull: 604 goals. Wait, that's way over 300.\n2. Stan Mikita: 541, also over.\n3. Steve Larmer: 406, still above.\n4. Denis Savard: 377, again above.\n5. Dennis Hull: 298, this is below 300.\n6. Jeremy Roenick: 267, under.\n7. Tony Amonte: 268, under.\n8. Hubert Pit Martin: 243, under.\n9. Bill Mosienko: 258, under.\n10. Ken Wharram: 252, under.\n\nWait, but the first three players already have regular season goals over 300. So, the claim that all players have less than 300 is false because Bobby Hull, Stan Mikita, and Steve Larmer each scored more than 300 in the regular season.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cells are the \"regular season\" column for each player to check their goal counts.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because several players have regular season goals exceeding 300. The relevant cells include all rows under the \"regular season\" column where values meet or exceed 300.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"no 2 player have scored the same total number of goals\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table represents. The columns are: name, years, regular season, playoffs, and total. Each row corresponds to a different player with their respective stats. The claim is about whether any two players have the same 'total' goals.\n\nSo, my plan is to look at each player's 'total' value and check if there are duplicates. If I find even one pair of players with the same total, then the claim is FALSE. Otherwise, it's TRUE.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n1. Bobby Hull: 666\n2. Stan Mikita: 600\n3. Steve Larmer: 451\n4. Denis Savard: 438\n5. Dennis Hull: 331\n6. Jeremy Roenick: 302\n7. Tony Amonte: 281\n8. Hubert Pit Martin: 269\n9. Bill Mosienko: 268\n10. Ken Wharram: 268\n\nNow, going through each player's total:\n\n- Bobby Hull has the highest with 666, no duplicates here.\n- Stan Mikita at 600 is unique so far.\n- Steve Larmer's 451 is also unique.\n- Denis Savard comes next with 438, which hasn't appeared yet.\n- Dennis Hull's total is 331, still unique.\n- Jeremy Roenick has 302, no duplicates up to this point.\n- Tony Amonte at 281 is unique as well.\n- Hubert Pit Martin: 269, not seen before.\n\nNow, looking at the last two players:\n\n- Bill Mosienko: 268\n- Ken Wharram: 268\n\nAh, here we go. Both Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram have a total of 268 goals each. This means there are indeed two players who share the same total number of goals.\n\nSo, since I found at least one pair with the same total, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells are those in the 'total' column for these two players.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is \"no 2 player have scored the same total number of goals.\" Upon examining the table, Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram both have a total of 268 goals. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:** The 'total' column contains each player's total goals.\n2. **Check for Duplicates:** Scan through all 'total' values to find duplicates.\n3. **Find Duplicate Totals:** Bill Mosienko (row 8) and Ken Wharram (row 9) both have 268 goals.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since there's a duplicate, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
