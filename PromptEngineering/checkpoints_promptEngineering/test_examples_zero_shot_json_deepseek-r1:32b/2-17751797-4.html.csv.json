This doesn't match because the date is earlier and Liverpool is home, not away.\n\nRow 1: Tie no \"replay\", Home team \"brighton & hove albion\", Score \"2 - 3\", Away team \"liverpool\", Date \"30/01/1991\". Here, the score is 2-3, Liverpool is the away team, and the date matches. This seems to fit all parts of the claim.\n\nI'll check other rows just to be thorough.\n\nRow 2: Tie no \"2\", Home team \"notts county\", Score \"2 - 0\", Away team \"oldham athletic\", Date \"26/01/1991\". Doesn't match.\n\nRow 3: Tie no \"3\", Home team \"crewe alexandra\", Score \"1 - 0\", Away team \"rotherham united\", Date \"26/01/1991\". No match.\n\nRow 4: Tie no \"4\", Home team \"luton town\", Score \"1 - 1\", Away team \"west ham united\", Date \"26/01/1991\". Doesn't apply.\n\nRow 5: Tie no \"replay\", Home team \"west ham united\", Score \"1 - 1\", Away team \"arsenal\", Date \"30/01/1991\". Not relevant since away team isn't Liverpool.\n\nRow 6 and beyond don't have the date 30/01/1991 except for row 5, but that's not Liverpool.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"the score be 1 - 0 when the home team be shrewsbury town\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems to state that when the home team is Shrewsbury Town, the score was 1-0. So, my goal is to check if there's a row in the table where the home team is Shrewsbury Town and the corresponding score is indeed 1-0.\n\nLooking at the JSON structure, it has two main parts: \"columns\" which define the headers, and \"data\" which contains the rows of data. The columns are \"tie no\", \"home team\", \"score\", \"away team\", and \"date\".\n\nI'll go through each row in the data array to find any instance where the home team is Shrewsbury Town.\n\nStarting with the first few rows:\n\n1. Row 0: Home team is Liverpool.\n2. Row 1: It's a replay, so home team is Brighton & Hove Albion.\n3. Row 2: The home team is Notts County.\n4. Row 3: Crewe Alexandra.\n5. Row 4: Luton Town.\n6. Row 5: Another replay with West Ham United as the home team.\n7. Row 6: Woking is the home team.\n8. Row 7: Here, I find \"shrewsbury town\" listed as the home team in row index 7.\n\nNow, checking the score for this row. The data for row 7 is [\u201c6\u201d, \u201cshrewsbury town\u201d, \u201c1 - 0\u201d, \u201cwimbledon\u201d, \u201c26 / 01 / 1991\u201d]. So the score is indeed 1-0 when Shrewsbury Town is the home team.\n\nTo ensure completeness, I'll continue checking the rest of the rows just in case there's another instance with Shrewsbury Town as the home team. Scanning through:\n\nRows 8 to 24 don't show any other entries where Shrewsbury Town is the home team. Therefore, the only relevant row is index 7.\n\nSo, the claim is supported by this data point, making it TRUE.

The claim is: \"for the home team of woking, the tie number be 5 and the score be 0 - 1\". So, I need to check if the home team 'woking' has tie number 5 and a score of 0-1.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table's data. The columns are \"tie no\", \"home team\", \"score\", \"away team\", and \"date\". Each row in the data array represents a match with these details.\n\nI need to find the row where the home team is 'woking'. Let me scan each row's \"home team\" column. Looking at the data:\n\n- Row 0: Liverpool\n- Row 1: Brighton & Hove Albion (replay)\n- Row 2: Notts County\n- Row 3: Crewe Alexandra\n- Row 4: Luton Town\n- Row 5: West Ham United (replay)\n- Row 6: Woking. Here it is! So row index 6.\n\nNow, checking the details for this row:\n- Tie no: \"5\" \u2192 which matches the claim.\n- Home team: \"woking\"\n- Score: \"0 - 1\"\n\nSo both conditions are satisfied here. The tie number is 5 and the score is 0-1 when 'woking' is the home team.\n\nI should make sure there's no other row with 'woking' as home team, but looking through the rest, I don't see any others.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"1 - 0 be the score when the home team be wimbledon\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. The user is saying that when Wimbledon was the home team, the score of their match was 1-0. So I need to find any row where the \"home team\" is Wimbledon and check if their score is indeed 1-0.\n\nLooking at the table data, there are several rows, each representing a different match with details like tie number, home team, score, away team, and date. I'll go through each row one by one to find any instance where Wimbledon was the home team.\n\nStarting from row index 0: The home team is Liverpool, not Wimbledon. Moving on.\n\nRow 1: Home team is Brighton & Hove Albion. No match here either.\n\nRow 2: Home team is Notts County. Not relevant.\n\nRow 3: Crewe Alexandra at home. Still no.\n\nRow 4: Luton Town as the home team.\n\nRow 5: West Ham United, still not Wimbledon.\n\nRow 6: Woking as the home team against Everton. Not relevant.\n\nRow 7: Shrewsbury Town is the home team here, and their opponent is Wimbledon. Wait a minute\u2014this row has \"Shrewsbury town\" as the home team and \"Wimbledon\" as the away team. The score was 1-0 in favor of Shrewsbury. So this isn't where Wimbledon is at home.\n\nContinuing to row 8: Newcastle United vs Nottingham Forest. Not relevant.\n\nRow 9: Nottingham Forest as the home team, but again, not Wimbledon.\n\nRow 10: Tottenham Hotspur at home against Oxford United. No match here.\n\nRow 11: Coventry City vs Southampton. Doesn't involve Wimbledon.\n\nRow 12: Portsmouth vs Bournemouth\u2014no connection to Wimbledon.\n\nRow 13: Manchester United as the home team, away is Bolton Wanderers. Not relevant.\n\nRow 14: Norwich City at home against Swindon Town.\n\nRow 15: Millwall vs Sheffield Wednesday. No.\n\nRow 16: Port Vale vs Manchester City. Still no.\n\nRow 17: Arsenal vs Leeds United\u2014this is a different row, but neither is Wimbledon.\n\nRows 18-20 are replays between Arsenal and Leeds, so again, not Wimbledon.\n\nFinally, row 21: Cambridge United as the home team against Middlesbrough. Not relevant.\n\nAfter checking all rows, I didn't find any instance where Wimbledon was the home team. The only mention of Wimbledon is in row 7 where they were the away team, and the score was 1-0 for Shrewsbury Town. Since there's no row where Wimbledon is at home with a score of 1-0, the claim isn't supported by the data.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cells are in row 7 where Wimbledon was involved, but since they weren't the home team and the score was against them, it doesn't satisfy the claim's condition.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Not Bolton.\nRow 1: away team is Liverpool. No.\nRow 2: away team is Oldham Athletic. No.\nRow 3: Rotherham United. No.\nRow 4: West Ham. No.\nRow 5: Luton Town as home, away is West Ham. Wait, no\u2014row 5 has \"replay\" as tie no, but the away team is still luton town? Or does \"replay\" indicate a different match?\n\nWait, actually, each row represents a game.

Let's see:\n\nThe data has 25 elements because it starts with index 0. So rows 0-24.\n\nNow, looking for 'away team' as \"bolton wanderers\":\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 14: Home is Port Vale, away is Manchester City. No.\nRow 15: Home is Arsenal, away is Leeds United.

Hmm, perhaps I need a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the row where Bolton is the away team is in the data. Let me check each row's 'away team' column:\n\nRow 0: Brighton & Hove Albion (home) - away is Liverpool? Wait no, looking back:\n\nWait, the columns are \"tie_no\", \"home_team\", \"away_team\", \"score\".\n\nWait, actually, wait the initial data structure isn't clear. The user provided a JSON with 'data' as an array of rows, each row being an object with keys: tie_no, home_team, away_team, score.\n\nSo for example, row 0 is:\n\n{\n   \"tie_no\": \"16\",\n   \"home_team\": \"cambridge united\",\n   \"away_team\": \"middlesbrough\",\n   \"score\": \"2  -  0\"\n}\n\nWait no, looking back at the data array provided by the user, it's a list of rows where each row is an object with tie_no, home_team, away_team, and score.\n\nSo in that case, let me go through each row:\n\nLooking for 'away_team' == \"bolton wanderers\"\n\nI'll scan each row's 'away_team':\n\nRow 0: away_team is \"brighton & hove albion\"\nRow 1: away_team is \"liverpool\"\nRow 2: away_team is \"oldham athletic\"\nRow 3: away_team is \"rotherham united\"\nRow 4: away_team is \"west ham united\"\nRow 5: away_team is \"luton town\" (replay)\nRow 6: not sure, but let me check each.\n\nWait perhaps I'm miscounting. Let's go step by step:\n\nLooking at the data array provided in the table:\n\nThe rows are as follows:\n\n0: tie_no \"1\", home \"liverpool\", away \"brighton & hove albion\", score \"3 - 0\"\n1: tie_no \"replay\", home \"brighton...\", away \"liverpool\", score \"2 - 0\"\n2: tie_no \"2\", home \"notts county\", away \"oldham athletic\", score \"1 - 1\"\n3: tie_no \"3\", home \"crewe alexandra\", away \"rotherham united\", score \"1 - 0\"\n4: tie_no \"4\", home \"luton town\", away \"west ham united\", score \"0 - 2\"\n5: tie_no \"replay\", home \"luton town\", away \"west ham united\", score \"0 - 1\"\n6: tie_no \"5\", home \"cambridge united\", away \"middlesbrough\", score \"2 - 0\" ?? Wait no, checking the data array:\n\nWait in the data provided by the user, row indices go from 0 to 24. Let me list them all correctly.\n\nLooking back at the data array as per the user's JSON:\n\nThe 'data' array has 25 rows (indices 0-24).

So perhaps in this dataset, Bolton only played at home once and didn't play any away games?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a mistake, or perhaps the data provided doesn't include all their matches.\n\nBut given the data we have, let's proceed with that.\n\nSo, if the task is to analyze Bolton Wanderers' performance when they were playing away, but in this dataset, there are no such instances. Therefore, any analysis would be based on limited data or perhaps require additional information.\n</think>\n\nBased on the provided data, Bolton Wanderers only played as the home team once against Huddersfield Town with a score of 3-1. There are no records where Bolton Wanderers were the away team in this dataset. Therefore, any analysis regarding their performance as an away team cannot be conducted with the given information.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nBolton Wanderers did not appear as the away team in any matches within the provided data set. Their only recorded match was at home against Huddersfield Town, resulting in a 3-1 victory.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"2 - 3 be the score when the home team be liverpool after 30 / 01 / 1991\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It says that the score was 2-3 for a match where Liverpool was the home team, and this happened after January 30, 1991. So I need to look through the table to find any matches involving Liverpool as the home team with a score of 2-3 on or after that date.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has columns: tie no, home team, score, away team, and date. The data is in rows where each cell corresponds to these columns.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Row 0: Tie no \"1\", Home team \"liverpool\", Score \"2 - 2\", Away team \"brighton & hove albion\", Date \"26 / 01 / 1991\". Liverpool is the home team here, but the score is 2-2, not 2-3. Also, the date is before January 30.\n\n2. Row 1: Tie no \"replay\", Home team \"brighton & hove albion\", Score \"2 - 3\", Away team \"liverpool\", Date \"30 / 01 / 1991\". Here, Liverpool is the away team, so this doesn't fit because we're looking for when they were home.\n\n3. Rows 2 to 5 don't involve Liverpool as either home or away teams, so I can skip those.\n\n4. Row 6: Home team \"woking\", not relevant.\n\n5. Row 7: Home team \"shrewsbury town\", nope.\n\n6. Row 8: Tie no \"7\", Home team \"newcastle united\", score doesn't match.\n\n7. Row 9: Tie no \"replay\", but again, home team is \"nottingham forest\".\n\n8. Rows 10-15 don't involve Liverpool either.\n\nWait, I just realized that in the data provided, there's a row (row 1) where the home team is Brighton and the away team is Liverpool, with a score of 2-3 on Jan 30. But since Liverpool was the away team there, it doesn't fit our claim which specifies Liverpool as the home team.\n\nIs there another row where Liverpool is the home team? Let me check again.\n\nRow 15: Home team \"arsenal\", nope. Row 16 onwards don't have Liverpool either. So in the entire table, Liverpool only appears once as a home team (row 0) and once as an away team (row 1). Both cases are on or before Jan 30.\n\nThe claim says \"after 30 / 01 / 1991\". The earliest date is Jan 26, then Jan 30. There's no match after that with Liverpool as the home team and a score of 2-3. So there are no rows where Liverpool was home, scored 2-3, and the date is after Jan 30.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the score 2-3 occurred when Liverpool was the home team on or after January 30, 1991. The only relevant rows are those where Liverpool is the home team and the date is on or after January 30. However, such a row does not exist in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"5 be the tie no before the away team be woking\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim correctly. It seems like it might have a typo. The word \"woking\" doesn't look right; perhaps it should be \"Woking,\" which is an actual football team. So I'll assume the claim is about the tie number 5 and whether the away team in that tie is Woking.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has columns: \"tie no\", \"home team\", \"score\", \"away team\", and \"date\". The rows are indexed starting from 0. \n\nThe claim mentions two conditions:\n1. \"tie no\" should be 5.\n2. The \"away team\" for that tie is Woking.\n\nI need to find the row where \"tie no\" is \"5\" and check if the corresponding \"away team\" is indeed Woking.\n\nLooking through the data:\n\n- Row index 4: Tie no \"4\", away team is Luton Town.\n- Row index 5: Tie no is \"replay\", so it's a replay, not relevant here.\n- Row index 6: Tie no \"5\", home team is Woking? Wait, let me check. No, in row index 6, the home team is Woking and the away team is Everton.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake. Let me look again:\n\nLooking at each row's tie number:\n- Row 0: Tie no \"1\"\n- Row 1: \"replay\"\n- Row 2: \"2\"\n- Row 3: \"3\"\n- Row 4: \"4\"\n- Row 5: \"replay\"\n- Row 6: \"5\" \u2192 This is the tie number we're interested in.\n- In row index 6, \"tie no\" is 5. The away team here is Everton, not Woking.\n\nWait a second, maybe I need to check all rows for tie no \"5\". Alternatively, perhaps the claim is that before (i.e., in an earlier match) the away team being Woking, there's a tie no 5. But looking at the table:\n\nLooking through all rows where the away team is Woking. Scanning each row:\n- Row index 6: Away team is Everton.\n- Other rows don't have \"Woking\" as the away team except perhaps if I missed something.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says \"5 be the tie no before the away team be woking.\" So it's saying that in a match where the away team is Woking, the tie number is 5. Or does it mean that in the row before (previous row) where the away team is Woking, the tie no was 5? \n\nBut looking at the table, I don't see any row where the away team is Woking except perhaps if there's a typo in the data or my understanding.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe the claim is that the tie number before (i.e., earlier than) a match where the away team is Woking is 5. So we need to find a row where the away team is Woking, and then check the tie no of the previous row.\n\nBut in this table, I don't see any row where the away team is Woking. Let me double-check each row's \"away team\" column:\n\nRow index 0: Chelsea (assuming from the data)\nWait, perhaps the data isn't fully provided here, but based on the given data, in row 6, tie no is 5, home team is Woking, away team is Everton. So if someone says that before the away team is Woking, the tie no was 5, that's not accurate because in this case, the away team isn't Woking; it's Everton.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the data or the claim. Since I don't see any row where the away team is Woking except maybe if Woking is misspelled as 'Woking' instead of 'Woking'. But in this table, I don't see that.\n\nWait, looking at row index 6: \"home team\" is Woking, and \"away team\" is Everton. So perhaps the claim meant that the tie no before (i.e., the previous tie) where Woking was the home team is 5. But in this case, it's correct because tie no 5 has Woking as the home team.\n\nBut the claim says \"before the away team be woking,\" which would mean looking for a row where the away team is Woking and checking if the previous tie number was 5. Since I don't see any such rows, perhaps the claim is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the claim's structure. The original claim: \"5 be the tie no before the away team be woking.\" It might mean that in a match where Woking is the away team, the tie number was 5. But since there's no such row, it would be false.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's parse each part of the claim. The structure seems to be:\n\n\"5 be the tie no before the away team be woking\"\n\nWhich could mean that in a row where \"tie no\" is 5, the \"away team\" is Woking. So let me check row index 6 (tie no 5). In this row, home team is Woking, and away team is Everton. So the away team isn't Woking; it's Everton. Therefore, the claim would be false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to a different tie number where the away team is Woking. But in the given data, I don't see any such row. The only occurrence of \"Woking\" is as the home team in tie no 5 (row index 6). So the claim that before the away team is Woking, the tie no was 5 doesn't hold because there's no such match.\n\nTherefore, based on the data provided, the claim is false. The relevant cells would be row 6 where tie no is 5 and away team is Everton.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that tie number 5 occurs before a match where Woking is the away team. However, in the table, tie number 5 has Woking as the home team against Everton as the away team. There's no row where Woking is the away team with a previous tie number of 5.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a given claim about a table (provided in JSON format) is TRUE or FALSE. The claim we're looking at is: \"1 0 be the score the home team be bolton wanderer.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that Bolton Wanderers were the home team and their score was 1-0. So, two things are being checked here: whether Bolton Wanderers were the home team and if the score was 1-0.\n\nNext, I should look at the structure of the table provided. The columns are \"tie no\", \"home team\", \"score\", \"away team\", and \"date\". The data is a list of rows with these entries. Each row represents a match between two teams with details about the tie number, home team, score, away team, and the date.\n\nI'll need to go through each row in the data array to check for any instance where Bolton Wanderers are listed as the home team and if their score is 1-0. Let me start scanning through the rows one by one.\n\nLooking at the first few entries:\n1. Row 0: Home team is Liverpool, score 2-2 against Brighton & Hove Albion.\n2. Row 1: It's a replay with Brighton & Hove Albion as home team and Liverpool away, score 2-3.\n3. Row 2: Notts County vs Oldham Athletic, score 2-0. Home team is Notts County.\n\nContinuing down:\n4. Row 3: Crewe Alexandra vs Rotherham United, score 1-0. Home team is Crewe Alexandra.\n5. Row 4: Luton Town vs West Ham United, score 1-1. Then a replay where West Ham won 5-0.\n\nStill no Bolton Wanderers yet. Moving further:\n6. Row 5: Woking vs Everton, score 0-1. Home team is Woking.\n7. Row 6: Shrewsbury Town vs Wimbledon, score 1-0. Home team is Shrewsbury Town.\n\nNo match yet. Next rows:\n8. Row 7: Arsenal vs Leeds United, initial game was 0-0, then a replay on the same date with another 1-1 draw, and finally a final replay where Leeds lost to Arsenal 2-1.\n\nWait, but the key point is looking for Bolton Wanderers as home team. Scanning further down:\n\nLooking at row indices beyond that:\nRow 14: Home team is Port Vale vs Manchester City, score 1-2.\nRow 15: Home team is Arsenal vs Leeds United, initial score 0-0 on January 27th.\n\nWait, I'm going too fast. Let me check each row carefully:\n\nLooking at the data array, there are 25 rows. Let's index them from 0 to 24.\n\nRow 14: Port Vale (home) vs Manchester City, score 1-2.\nRow 15: Arsenal (home) vs Leeds United, score 0-0 on January 27th.\nRow 16: Replay between Leeds and Arsenal on the same date, still 1-1.\nRow 17: Another replay between Arsenal and Leeds on February 13th, again ending in a draw.\nRow 18: Final replay where Leeds lost to Arsenal 2-1 on February 16th.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed Bolton Wanderers earlier. Let me go back.\n\nLooking at row indices:\n\nRow 0: Liverpool\nRow 1: Brighton & Hove Albion (replay)\nRow 2: Notts County\nRow 3: Crewe Alexandra\nRow 4: Luton Town\nRow 5: Woking\nRow 6: Shrewsbury Town\nRow 7: Arsenal\nRow 8: Cambridge United\n\nWait, that's only up to row 14 or so. Let me check all rows:\n\nWait the data array has 25 entries (indices 0-24). So I'll go through each one.\n\nRow 0:\n\"tie no\": \"Youth Cup\"\n\"home team\": Liverpool\n\"score\": 2 - 2\n\nNo, not Bolton.\n\nRow 1: Replay between Brighton and Liverpool, score 2-3. Home team is Brighton & Hove Albion.\n\nRow 2: Notts County vs Oldham Athletic, score 2-0. Home team Notts County.\n\nRow 3: Crewe Alexandra vs Rotherham United, 1-0. Home team Crewe Alexandra.\n\nRow 4: Luton Town vs West Ham United, 1-1.\n\nRow 5: Woking vs Everton, 0-1.\n\nRow 6: Shrewsbury Town vs Wimbledon, 1-0.\n\nRow 7: Arsenal vs Leeds United, initial game 0-0.\n\nRow 8: Port Vale vs Manchester City, 1-2.\n\nRow 9: Arsenal vs Leeds replay on same date, 1-1.\n\nRow 10: Another replay between Arsenal and Leeds on February 13th, still draw 1-1.\n\nRow 11: Final replay where Leeds lose to Arsenal 2-1 on February 16th.\n\nWait, I think I'm miscounting. Let me recount the rows properly.\n\nActually, looking back at the data array provided in the JSON:\n\nThe data array has 25 entries (from row 0 to row 24). So let's go through each row systematically.\n\nRow 0: Home team Liverpool vs Brighton & Hove Albion, score 2-2.\nRow 1: Replay, home team Brighton & Hove Albion vs Liverpool, score 2-3.\nRow 2: Notts County (home) vs Oldham Athletic, 2-0.\nRow 3: Crewe Alexandra (home) vs Rotherham United, 1-0.\nRow 4: Luton Town (home) vs West Ham United, 1-1.\nRow 5: Woking (home) vs Everton, 0-1.\nRow 6: Shrewsbury Town (home) vs Wimbledon, 1-0.\nRow 7: Arsenal (home) vs Leeds United, 0-0 on January 27th.\nRow 8: Port Vale (home) vs Manchester City, 1-2.\nRow 9: Arsenal (home) vs Leeds United, replay with score 1-1 on same date? Wait, looking at the data:\n\nWait in row 15:\n\"tie no\": \"F.A. Cup\"\n\"home team\": Arsenal\n\"score\": 0 - 0\n\"away team\": Leeds United\n\"date\": \"27/01\"\n\nThen rows after that are replays.\n\nSo perhaps I need to check for Bolton Wanderers in any of these rows as the home team.\n\nLooking through all rows, from 0 to 24:\n\nRow 14: Port Vale (home) vs Manchester City, score 1-2.\nRow 15: Arsenal (home) vs Leeds United, initial game 0-0 on Jan 27th.\nRow 16: Replay between Leeds and Arsenal on same date, 1-1 draw.\nRow 17: Another replay on February 13th, still 1-1.\nRow 18: Final replay where Leeds lost to Arsenal 2-1 on Feb 16th.\n\nWait a second, I'm not seeing Bolton Wanderers as the home team in any of these rows. Did I miss it?\n\nLooking back at row indices:\n\nRow 0: Liverpool\nRow 1: Brighton & Hove Albion\nRow 2: Notts County\nRow 3: Crewe Alexandra\nRow 4: Luton Town\nRow 5: Woking\nRow 6: Shrewsbury Town\nRow 7: Arsenal\nRow 8: Port Vale\nRow 9: Not sure, looking at the data array.\n\nWait perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me look again:\n\nThe data array as per JSON is:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"tie no\": \"Youth Cup\",\n    \"home team\": \"Liverpool\",\n    ...\n  },\n  {\n    \"tie no\": \"F.A. Cup\",\n    \"home team\": \"Brighton & Hove Albion\",\n    ...\n  },\n  ... up to row 24.\n]\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nIs there a row where the home team is Bolton Wanderers? From the initial glance, I don't see it.\n\nSo, if in none of the rows does Bolton Wanderers appear as the home team with a score of 1-0 or any other score matching the condition, then perhaps such an entry doesn't exist.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that there is no such row where Bolton Wanderers are the home team with the specified conditions.\n</think>\n\nThe task is to determine if there's a match in the provided data where Bolton Wanderers were the home team. Upon reviewing all 25 entries, none list Bolton Wanderers as the home team. Therefore, no such entry exists.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThere is no game where Bolton Wanderers are listed as the home team with the specified conditions.",
