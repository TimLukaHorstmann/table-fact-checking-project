The claim says: \"there be 2 race that take place in 1984, while there be only 1 race in 1983.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim is saying. It's talking about two years: 1984 and 1983. For 1984, it claims there were 2 races, and for 1983, only 1 race.\n\nI need to check how many entries (rows) there are for each year in the table. Each row represents a team's participation in a race during that year.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nFor 1983:\n- There is one entry: [1983, \"arrows racing team\", ...]. So that's just one row for 1983. That seems to match the claim of only 1 race.\n\nNow checking 1984:\nLooking through the data rows, I see two entries where the year is 1984:\n- First entry: [1984, \"barclay nordica arrows bmw\", ...]\n- Second entry: [1984, \"barclay nordica arrows bmw\", ...] but with a different chassis and engine. So that's two rows for 1984.\n\nSo the claim says there are 2 races in 1984 and only 1 in 1983, which matches what I see in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because there are exactly 2 entries for 1984 and 1 entry for 1983 in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "sasol jordan be a team tie for the least amount of race with 1",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"sasol jordan be a team tie for the least amount of race with 1\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are year, team, chassis, engine, and points. The data has multiple rows representing different years and teams along with their corresponding points.\n\nThe claim mentions \"sasol jordan\" as a team. Looking through the 'team' column, I see that sasol jordan appears only once in the last row (row index 14). Their points are 0 for that year (1993).\n\nNow, the claim says they tie for the least amount of races with 1. Wait, the table doesn't have a 'races' column; instead, it has 'points'. So I think the user might be referring to points as an indicator of performance or participation. The lowest point value in the table is 0.\n\nLooking at all the rows, several teams have 0 points: arrows racing team in 1983 (row 0), barclay arrows bmw in 1986 (rows 4 and 5), ligier gitanes in both 1991 entries (rows 11 and 12). Additionally, sasol jordan has 0 points in 1993 (row 14).\n\nSo the teams with 0 points are:\n- arrows racing team: 1 occurrence\n- barclay arrows bmw: 2 occurrences\n- ligier gitanes: 2 occurrences\n- sasol jordan: 1 occurrence\n\nThe claim says \"tie for the least amount of race with 1\". If we interpret 'race' as participation, maybe it's referring to points. The least points are 0, and several teams have that.\n\nBut wait, the team sasol jordan has only one entry with 0 points. However, there are other teams like arrows racing team (row 0) also with 0 points but just once as well. So if we're counting how many times a team achieved the least points, sasol jordan is tied with others for having 1 occurrence of 0 points.\n\nBut looking again, the table shows multiple entries for some teams. For example, barclay arrows bmw has two rows in 1986 both with 0 points (rows 4 and 5). So their total points are 0 across two races, but each entry is separate.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim refers to how many times a team achieved the least amount of points. The least is 0, and sasol jordan has one occurrence, while others have multiple. So if we're considering teams that have at least one 0 point, sasol jordan isn't tied with anyone for having exactly one occurrence of 0 points because other teams like ligier gitanes also have two entries but their total might be considered as a sum or individually.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about how many times the team participated (i.e., number of rows) and their performance. But sasol jordan has only one entry, which would mean they participated once with 0 points. Other teams like barclay arrows bmw have multiple participations but also have higher points in some years.\n\nWait, the claim says \"tie for the least amount of race\". If 'race' refers to participation count, sasol jordan has one race (one row), while others may have more. But looking at the table:\n\n- sasol jordan: 1 entry\n- ligier gitanes: two entries in 1991 and one in 1992 (but points are 0, 0, 2)\n- arrows racing team: only one entry with 0 points.\n\nSo if the least number of races is 1, then teams like sasol jordan and arrows racing team each have one race. So they tie for the least number of races. But wait, in row 0, arrows racing team has 0 points in 1983, but then barclay nordica arrows bmw appears in 1984 with two entries (rows 1 and 2), so perhaps each entry is a separate race or participation.\n\nWait, the table seems to list multiple entries per year for some teams. For example, in 1984, barclay nordica arrows bmw has two different chassis and engines but same team name. So maybe each row represents a race or an event where they participated with specific setup.\n\nBut that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps each row is a constructor's entry for a season, with multiple entries per year if they used different chassis/engine combinations.\n\nIn any case, to determine the least number of races (assuming each row is a separate participation), sasol jordan has one participation (row 14). Other teams like arrows racing team have only one entry as well (row 0). So both would tie for the least with 1 race. But in that case, sasol jordan isn't the only one; others also have 1.\n\nBut the claim says \"sasol jordan be a team tie for the least amount of race with 1\". If they are tied with another team(s) having 1 race each, then it's true. However, looking at other teams:\n\n- barclay nordica arrows bmw: appears in 1984 (rows 1 and 2), so two participations.\n- barclay arrows bmw: in 1986 (rows 4 and 5), two participations.\n- ligier gitanes: 1991 (rows 11, 12) and 1992 (row 13), so three participations.\n\nSo only sasol jordan and arrows racing team have one participation each. Thus, they tie for the least with 1 race each. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because sasol jordan is tied with another team for having the least number of races (1).\n\nWait, but in row 0, it's arrows racing team, which has only one entry. So yes, both have one participation each, making them tie.\n\nAlternatively, if 'race' refers to points earned, then sasol jordan is tied with others who also have 0 points. But the claim specifically mentions \"tie for the least amount of race\", so I think it's about participation count.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"sasol jordan be a team tie for the least amount of race with 1\". Upon examining the table, sasol jordan appears once (row 14) with 0 points. Other teams like arrows racing team also have one entry each with 0 points. Therefore, they are tied for the least number of participations.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"result\": \"TRUE\"\n}\n```",

Let's break down the claim and check each part against the data.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"Canon Williams.\" Looking at the 'team' column, I see entries for \"canon williams team\" in rows where the year is 1989. So that part matches.\n\nNext, it says they earned 37 points. Checking the 'points' column for those relevant rows, both entries have 37 points each. That's consistent with the claim.\n\nThe claim also mentions \"2 time earn,\" which I interpret as earning points twice in 1989. Looking at the table, there are two separate entries for \"canon williams team\" in 1989, each with 37 points. This indicates they earned 37 points twice that year.\n\nPutting it all together: the team is correctly identified as \"Canon Williams,\" the year is 1989, and they have two instances of earning 37 points each.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the most race that happen in any year be 2, which happen on 4 occasion\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's trying to state that there are years where only two races occurred, and such a scenario happened four times across different years.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see columns: year, team, chassis, engine, points. The data spans from 1983 to 1993. Each row represents a specific entry for a team in a particular year with their respective chassis, engine, and points.\n\nThe claim mentions \"most race that happen in any year be 2.\" So, I need to check if there are years where the number of races (or entries) is 2. Then, it says this happened on 4 occasions, meaning four different years had exactly two races each.\n\nTo verify this, I'll count how many times each year appears in the data because each row represents a race or entry for that team in that year. If a year has multiple rows, each indicates a separate race or participation by the same team with different chassis or engines.\n\nLet me list out the years and their counts:\n\n- 1983: Appears once.\n- 1984: Appears twice (rows 1 and 2).\n- 1985: Once.\n- 1986: Twice (rows 4 and 5).\n- 1987: Once.\n- 1988: Once.\n- 1989: Twice (rows 8 and 9).\n- 1990: Once.\n- 1991: Twice (rows 11 and 12).\n- 1992: Once.\n- 1993: Once.\n\nNow, let's identify the years that have exactly two entries:\n\n- 1984: 2 entries\n- 1986: 2 entries\n- 1989: 2 entries\n- 1991: 2 entries\n\nThat makes four years (1984, 1986, 1989, 1991) each having exactly two races. So the claim that there are four occasions where a year had two races is supported by the data.\n\nNext, I need to ensure that these counts are correct and that no other years have more than two entries. Looking through the list again:\n\n- 1983: 1\n- 1984: 2\n- 1985: 1\n- 1986: 2\n- 1987: 1\n- 1988: 1\n- 1989: 2\n- 1990: 1\n- 1991: 2\n- 1992: 1\n- 1993: 1\n\nYes, only the four years have two entries each. There are no other years with more than two entries, so \"the most race that happen in any year be 2\" is correct.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"a lamborghini engineer be use during 2 race in 1991\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like there's a typo and it should probably say \"used\" instead of \"be use.\" So the corrected claim would be: \"A Lamborghini engine was used during 2 races in 1991.\"\n\nNow, looking at the table, which has columns for year, team, chassis, engine, and points. The relevant information here is about engines from Lamborghini in the year 1991.\n\nI'll go through each row to find entries where the year is 1991. Let's see:\n\n- Row index 10: Year 1990, so skip.\n- Rows 11 and 12 are both for 1991. Checking these rows:\n   - Row 11: Team \"ligier gitanes\", chassis \"ligier js35\", engine \"lamborghini v12\", points 0.\n   - Row 12: Team \"ligier gitanes\", chassis \"ligier js35b\", engine \"lamborghini v12\", points 0.\n\nSo, there are two entries for the year 1991 where the engine is Lamborghini V12. This means that in both these races, a Lamborghini engine was used by the Ligier Gitanes team. \n\nTherefore, the claim that a Lamborghini engine was used during two races in 1991 seems to be supported by the data in rows 11 and 12.\n\nI should also check if there are any other entries for 1991 with Lamborghini engines. Rows beyond 12: row 13 is 1992, so no more 1991 entries. \n\nSo, two races (rows) in 1991 used a Lamborghini engine. Hence, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"engine\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"engine\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"there be 2 race that take place in 1984, while there be only 1 race in 1983.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions two parts:\n1. In 1984, there were 2 races.\n2. In 1983, there was only 1 race.\n\nSo, I'll have to check each year separately and count how many entries (rows) correspond to those years in the table.\n\nLooking at the JSON structure, it has \"columns\" which are [\"year\", \"team\", \"chassis\", \"engine\", \"points\"], and \"data\" which is an array of rows. Each row represents a record with values for each column in order.\n\nStarting with 1983: I'll go through each row and check the 'year' value. \n\n- Row 0: year is 1983.\nThat's the only occurrence of 1983 in the data. So, there's exactly 1 race in 1983.\n\nNext, checking for 1984:\n\n- Row 1: year is 1984.\n- Row 2: year is also 1984.\nThat's two rows with 1984, so there are 2 races in 1984.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are correct.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"sasol jordan be a team tie for the most amount of race win\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that the team \"sasol jordan\" tied with another team for having the most race wins. But I notice a typo in the claim: \"be a team tie\" should probably be \"is a team that tied.\" So the corrected claim would be: \"Sasol Jordan is a team that tied for the most amount of race wins.\"\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, I see that each row contains information about different racing teams across various years. The columns are year, team, chassis, engine, and points.\n\nThe key part here is to determine which team has the highest number of points, as points likely correlate with race wins or performance. So, I need to look at the \"points\" column for each team and see who has the highest total.\n\nLet me go through the data row by row:\n\n1. 1983: Arrows Racing Team - Points: 0\n2. 1984: Barclay Nordica Arrows BMW (two entries) - Points: 5 each, so total for this team in 1984 is 10.\n3. 1985: Barclay Arrows BMW - Points: 11\n4. 1986: Barclay Arrows BMW (two entries) - Points: 0 each, total 0\n5. 1987: Benetton Formula Ltd - Points: 16\n6. 1988: Benetton Formula Ltd - Points: 27\n7. 1989: Canon Williams Team (two entries) - Points: 37 each, total 74 for the year\n8. 1990: Canon Williams Renault - Points: 34\n9. 1991: Ligier Gitanes (two entries) - Points: 0 each, total 0\n10. 1992: Ligier Gitanes Blondes - Points: 2\n11. 1993: Sasol Jordan - Points: 0\n\nLooking at the points per team:\n\n- Arrows Racing Team has a total of 0 in 1983 and 5+5=10 in 1984, then 11 in 1985, but 0s after that. So their peak was 11.\n- Benetton Formula Ltd had 16 in 1987 and 27 in 1988, so their total over these years is 43.\n- Canon Williams Team in 1989 had two entries with 37 each, totaling 74 points for that year alone. In 1990, they have 34 points as \"Canon Williams Renault.\" So their total would be 37+37+34=108 across these years.\n- Ligier Gitanes had mostly zeros but a couple of points in 1992: 2. Sasol Jordan only appears once with 0 points.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the points per team per year and see who has the highest points each year or overall.\n\nBut the claim is about race wins. In racing, points are often awarded based on finishing positions, so higher points usually mean more wins. However, it's possible that \"points\" in this table don't directly correlate to race wins but could be a measure of performance.\n\nLooking at the maximum points per year:\n\n- 1983: Arrows Racing Team - 0\n- 1984: Barclay Nordica Arrows BMW had two entries with 5 each, so total 10. Another team in 1984? No, only this one.\n- 1985: Barclay Arrows BMW - 11\n- 1986: Both entries for the same team have 0 points.\n- 1987: Benetton with 16\n- 1988: Benetton with 27\n- 1989: Canon Williams Team had two entries each with 37, so total of 74. That's the highest in a single year.\n- 1990: Canon Williams Renault with 34\n- 1991: Ligier Gitanes - 0\n- 1992: Ligier Gitanes Blondes with 2\n- 1993: Sasol Jordan - 0\n\nSo the highest points in a single year is 74 by Canon Williams Team in 1989. Now, considering that \"sasol jordan\" has 0 points every time they appear, and other teams have higher points.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"tied for the most amount of race wins.\" So if another team also had the same highest number of wins as sasol jordan, which is zero? That doesn't make sense because having zero points isn't a tie for the most; it's the opposite.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the claim is that Sasol Jordan tied with another team for the most race wins overall across all years. But looking at their total points: Sasol Jordan has only one entry in 1993 with 0 points. So they have zero points, while other teams like Benetton and Canon Williams have much higher totals.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible for Sasol Jordan to be tied for the most race wins because they didn't win any races (assuming points correlate with wins). The team(s) with the highest points would beCanon Williams Team with 74 in 1989, and perhaps Benetton over multiple years. So the claim is not accurate.\n\nHence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"Sasol Jordan tied for the most race wins\" is false because they have zero points across all their appearances, while other teams like Canon Williams Team had significantly higher points, indicating more wins.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": \"false\"\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the most race that happen in any year be 4, which happen on 3 occasions.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse what this claim is saying. It seems to suggest two things:\n1. The maximum number of races in a single year was 4.\n2. This maximum (of 4 races) occurred in three different years.\n\nWait, that might not make sense because if each occurrence is a different year, then having the same maximum across multiple years would imply more than one year with that maximum. Alternatively, maybe it's saying that there were four races in total across all years, but that seems unlikely given the data spans from 1983 to 1993.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-express the claim: \"the most race that happen in any year be 4.\" So, for each year, count the number of races (rows per year), and find the maximum number across all years. Then it says this maximum happened on 3 occasions. So three different years had the same maximum number of races.\n\nWait, but looking at the data:\n\nLooking at each year and counting how many entries there are for each year:\n\n- 1983: 1 entry\n- 1984: 2 entries (rows 0 and 1? Wait no, rows are indexed from 0. Let's list all years with their counts:\n\nWait the data array is as follows:\n\nRows:\n0: 1983\n1: 1984\n2: 1984\n3: 1985\n4: 1986\n5: 1986\n6: 1987\n7: 1988\n8: 1989\n9: 1989\n10: 1990\n11: 1991\n12: 1991\n13: 1992\n14: 1993\n\nSo for each year:\n\n- 1983: 1 row\n- 1984: 2 rows (indices 1 and 2)\n- 1985: 1 row (index 3)\n- 1986: 2 rows (indices 4 and 5)\n- 1987: 1 row (index 6)\n- 1988: 1 row (index 7)\n- 1989: 2 rows (indices 8 and 9)\n- 1990: 1 row (index 10)\n- 1991: 2 rows (indices 11 and 12)\n- 1992: 1 row (index 13)\n- 1993: 1 row (index 14)\n\nWait that's a mistake. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the data array:\n\nRow 0: 1983\nRow 1: 1984\nRow 2: 1984\nRow 3: 1985\nRow 4: 1986\nRow 5: 1986\nRow 6: 1987\nRow 7: 1988\nRow 8: 1989\nRow 9: 1989\nRow 10: 1990\nRow 11: 1991\nRow 12: 1991\nRow 13: 1992\nRow 14: 1993\n\nSo counts per year:\n\n- 1983: 1\n- 1984: 2 (rows 1 and 2)\n- 1985: 1\n- 1986: 2 (rows 4 and 5)\n- 1987: 1\n- 1988: 1\n- 1989: 2 (rows 8 and 9)\n- 1990: 1\n- 1991: 2 (rows 11 and 12)\n- 1992: 1\n- 1993: 1\n\nSo the maximum number of races in any year is 2. This occurs for years 1984, 1986, 1989, and 1991\u2014so four times.\n\nBut the claim says \"the most race that happen in any year be 4,\" which I think refers to a maximum of 4 races per year, but according to this data, the maximum is 2. Therefore, the first part of the claim is incorrect because the highest number of races in a single year was 2, not 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding \"race\" as something else, like entries or teams? Wait no, each row represents an entry for a particular team in a race, but if multiple rows are from the same year, that might indicate multiple races. So for example, two rows in 1984 would mean two races in that year.\n\nWait wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe \"race\" refers to each row being a different race, so the number of races per year is how many times that year appears in the data. If that's the case, then:\n\n- For 1983: 1 race\n- 1984: 2 races\n- 1985: 1\n- 1986: 2\n- 1987: 1\n- 1988: 1\n- 1989: 2\n- 1990: 1\n- 1991: 2\n- 1992: 1\n- 1993: 1\n\nSo the maximum number of races in a year is 2, occurring for four different years (1984, 1986, 1989, 1991). So if the claim says \"the most race that happen in any year be 4,\" meaning the maximum was 4, which isn't true because it's 2. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure of the data. Each row might represent a team's participation in a particular race within a year. So for example, two entries under 1984 could mean two different teams participating in one race in that year, but actually, each row would be a separate race. Or maybe not.\n\nWait no, typically in such datasets, each row represents a result from a specific race, so the number of rows per year would indicate how many races were held that year. So if 1984 has two rows, that means two races were held in 1984.\n\nThus, the maximum number of races in any given year is 2, occurring in four years: 1984, 1986, 1989, and 1991. Therefore, the claim stating that \"the most race that happen in any year be 4\" is incorrect because it was actually 2, not 4.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the maximum number of races in a year was 4, occurring three times. However, analyzing the data shows each year had at most 2 races, so the correct maximum is 2, which occurred four times. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"result\": \"false\"\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"ligier gitanes 2 time earn 37 point in race during 1989\". \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It seems like it's saying that Ligier Gitanes earned 37 points twice in races during the year 1989.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each row where the team is \"ligier gitanes\" and the year is 1989. Let me go through the data rows one by one.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- The first few entries are about Arrows Racing Team in 1983, 1984, etc. Not relevant.\n- Then we get to Benetton Formula Ltd in 1987 and 1988. Still not Ligier Gitanes.\n- Moving on, I see \"canon williams team\" in 1989, with two entries: one for Williams FW12C and another for FW13, both with 37 points each. So that's two rows with the same team but different chassis, same year, same points.\n- Then in 1990, it's \"canon williams renault\", so not Ligier Gitanes.\n- In 1991 and onwards, there are entries for Ligier Gitanes. For example, in 1991, they have two entries with 0 points each.\n\nWait a second, the claim mentions Ligier Gitanes earning 37 points twice in 1989. But looking at the data, I see that in 1989, it's actually \"canon williams team\" that has the 37 points, not Ligier Gitanes. Ligier Gitanes only appears starting from 1991 with 0 points.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because it attributes the 37 points to Ligier Gitanes in 1989, but according to the table, those points were earned by Canon Williams Team. There are no entries for Ligier Gitanes in 1989; they appear later with different point totals.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells that show this discrepancy are the two rows for \"canon williams team\" in 1989 where they have 37 points each. These rows contradict the claim because they belong to a different team.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly attributes 37 points earned twice by Ligier Gitanes in 1989, but the table shows that those points were for Canon Williams Team.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"a renault v10 engine be use during 2 race in 1991\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It says that a Renault V10 engine was used during two races in 1991. So I'm looking for entries where the year is 1991 and the engine is Renault V10. The number of such entries should be two for the claim to be true.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row and check if the year is 1991 and the engine matches Renault V10.\n\nRow indexes in the data array start from 0. Let's list out the relevant rows:\n\n- Row 8: Year 1989, team canon williams team, engine renault v10. Not relevant since it's not 1991.\n- Row 9: Same as above, same year and engine. Also not relevant.\n- Row 10: Year 1990, team canon williams renault, engine renault v10. Still not 1991.\n- Row 11: Year 1991, team ligier gitanes, engine lamborghini v12. So engine is Lamborghini, not Renault. Doesn't match.\n- Row 12: Same as row 11, same year and engine. Still Lamborghini.\n- Rows beyond that are years after 1991.\n\nWait, looking again at the data:\n\nRow indexes:\n0: 1983\n1: 1984\n2: 1984\n3: 1985\n4: 1986\n5: 1986\n6: 1987\n7: 1988\n8: 1989\n9: 1989\n10: 1990\n11: 1991\n12: 1991\n13: 1992\n14: 1993\n\nSo rows 11 and 12 are for 1991. Both have team ligier gitanes, engine lamborghini v12.\n\nSo in 1991, both entries have Lamborghini engines, not Renault. There's no entry where the year is 1991 and the engine is Renault V10.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there are zero Renault V10 engines used in 1991 races, not two.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"engine\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"engine\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
