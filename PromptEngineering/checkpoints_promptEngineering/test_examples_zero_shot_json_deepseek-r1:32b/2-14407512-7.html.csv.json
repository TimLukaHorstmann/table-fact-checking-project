    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about Andreas Kofler is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says that his \"1st (m)\" should be greater than 124.5 and his \"2nd (m)\" should be greater than 136.\n\nFirst, let me locate Andreas Kofler in the data. Looking at the rows:\n\n- Row 0: Andreas K\u00e4cttel\n- Row 1: Gregor Schlierenzauer\n- Row 2: Thomas Morgenstern\n- Row 3: Wolfgang Loitzl\n- Row 4: Andreas Kofler\n\nSo, row index 4 is where Andreas Kofler's data is. Now, I need to check the \"1st (m)\" and \"2nd (m)\" columns for this row.\n\nLooking at the columns:\n- The third column is \"1st (m)\", which in JSON terms would be index 3 if starting from 0.\nWait, no, wait: let me recount. The columns are:\n\n[\"rank\", \"name\", \"nationality\", \"1st (m)\", \"2nd (m)\", \"points\", \"overall wc points (rank)\"]\n\nSo, the indices for each column would be:\n- rank: 0\n- name: 1\n- nationality: 2\n- 1st (m): 3\n- 2nd (m):4\n\nWait no, in JSON arrays, indexes start at 0. So:\n\ncolumns[0] = \"rank\"\ncolumns[1] = \"name\"\ncolumns[2] = \"nationality\"\ncolumns[3] = \"1st (m)\"\ncolumns[4] = \"2nd (m)\"\ncolumns[5] = \"points\"\ncolumns[6] = \"overall wc points (rank)\"\n\nSo, for row 4 (Andreas Kofler), the values are:\n\nLooking at data[4]: [5, \"andreas kofler\", \"aut\", 130.0, 139.0, 243.2, \"293 (4)\"]\n\nSo, 1st (m) is 130.0 and 2nd (m) is 139.0.\n\nNow, checking the claim:\n\n1st (m) > 124.5: Is 130.0 > 124.5? Yes.\n2nd (m) > 136: Is 139.0 > 136? Yes.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, so the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells would be row_index=4 for both \"1st (m)\" and \"2nd (m)\". So, two objects in relevant_ells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1st (m)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2nd (m)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the lowest point earn when the 2nd (m) be 135.0 be 246.6\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand what the claim is saying. It seems a bit unclear at first glance, but perhaps it's stating that when the \"2nd (m)\" value is 135.0, the corresponding \"points\" value should be 246.6, which would be the lowest point earned in that context.\n\nLooking at the table provided, let me map out each row to see if this holds true. The columns are rank, name, nationality, 1st (m), 2nd (m), points, and overall wc points (rank). \n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: \n   - Rank: 1\n   - Name: Andreas k\u00e4t\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043c\n   - Nationality: sui\n   - 1st (m): 125.5\n   - 2nd (m): 136.0\n   - Points: 252.7\n   - Overall wc points (rank): \"227 (7)\"\n   \n   Here, the \"2nd (m)\" is 136.0, which doesn't match 135.0, so this row isn't relevant.\n\n2. **Row 1**: \n   - Rank: 2\n   - Name: Gregor Schlierenzauer\n   - Nationality: aut\n   - 1st (m): 124.5\n   - 2nd (m): 136.0\n   - Points: 248.9\n   - Overall wc points (rank): \"429 (2)\"\n   \n   Again, the \"2nd (m)\" is 136.0, not 135.0.\n\n3. **Row 2**: \n   - Rank: 3\n   - Name: Thomas Morgenstern\n   - Nationality: aut\n   - 1st (m): 124.5\n   - 2nd (m): 135.0\n   - Points: 246.6\n   - Overall wc points (rank): \"660 (1)\"\n   \n   This row has \"2nd (m)\" as 135.0, which matches the claim. The corresponding \"points\" here are 246.6.\n\n4. **Row 3**: \n   - Rank: 4\n   - Name: Wolfgang Loitzl\n   - Nationality: aut\n   - 1st (m): 122.5\n   - 2nd (m): 136.0\n   - Points: 246.3\n   - Overall wc points (rank): \"300 (3)\"\n   \n   The \"2nd (m)\" is 136.0 again, not matching.\n\n5. **Row 4**: \n   - Rank: 5\n   - Name: Andreas Kofler\n   - Nationality: aut\n   - 1st (m): 130.0\n   - 2nd (m): 139.0\n   - Points: 243.2\n   - Overall wc points (rank): \"293 (4)\"\n   \n   The \"2nd (m)\" here is 139.0, which doesn't match.\n\nFrom this analysis, only Row 2 has a \"2nd (m)\" of 135.0 and the corresponding \"points\" are indeed 246.6. Now, I need to check if 246.6 is the lowest point earned when \"2nd (m)\" is 135.0.\n\nLooking at all rows where \"2nd (m)\" is 135.0 (only Row 2 in this case), the points are 246.6. Since there's only one such row, it is trivially the lowest point earned for that specific \"2nd (m)\" value. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- The \"2nd (m)\" column in Row 2.\n- The \"points\" column in Row 2.\n\nThese are the only two cells needed to confirm that when \"2nd (m)\" is 135.0, the points earned are 246.6, which is the lowest as there are no other entries with \"2nd (m)\" at 135.0.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2nd (m)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"346.6 be the lowest point earn that also have 135.0 as 2nd (m)\". Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions two things: a points value of 346.6 and a 2nd (m) value of 135.0. The claim is saying that 346.6 is the lowest point earned among entries where the 2nd (m) is 135.0.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to check if any have a \"2nd (m)\" of 135.0. Let's see:\n\nRow 0: 2nd (m) is 136.0 \u2192 Not 135.0\nRow 1: 2nd (m) is 136.0 \u2192 Not 135.0\nRow 2: 2nd (m) is 135.0 \u2192 This matches the condition.\nRow 3: 2nd (m) is 136.0 \u2192 Doesn't match\nRow 4: 2nd (m) is 139.0 \u2192 Doesn't match\n\nSo, only Row 2 has a \"2nd (m)\" of 135.0. Now, looking at the points for this row, it's 246.6. The claim states that 346.6 is the lowest point earned under this condition, but in reality, there's only one entry with 2nd (m) as 135.0 and its points are 246.6.\n\nWait a second, that means there's no other entries to compare for being the \"lowest\" because it's the only one. But even if we consider just this one, 246.6 is not equal to 346.6. So, the claim is incorrect on two counts: first, the points don't match, and second, there isn't another entry to establish a lowest point.\n\nTherefore, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to finding an entry with \"2nd (m)\" of 135.0 and checking if its points are 346.6 as the lowest. The table shows only one such entry with points 246.6, which doesn't match and isn't the claimed value.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2nd (m)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table in JSON format. The claim says: \"393 (4) be the overall wc point  (rank) that have 139 as the 2nd  (m)\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim is referring to. The table has several columns: rank, name, nationality, 1st (m), 2nd (m), points, and overall wc points (rank). So, \"overall wc point (rank)\" refers to the column named \"overall wc points  (rank)\", which contains values like \"227 (7)\", \"429 (2)\", etc. The claim is talking about an entry where this value is \"393 (4)\". \n\nNext, the claim mentions that this should be for someone who has \"139\" as their \"2nd  (m)\" score. So I need to look through each row in the data and check two things: does any row have a \"2nd  (m)\" value of 139? And if so, what is its corresponding \"overall wc points  (rank)\" value?\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\nRow 0:\n- 2nd (m) is 136.0\nRow 1:\n- 2nd (m) is 136.0\nRow 2:\n- 2nd (m) is 135.0\nRow 3:\n- 2nd (m) is 136.0\nRow 4:\n- 2nd (m) is 139.0\n\nSo, row index 4 has a \"2nd (m)\" value of 139. Now I need to check the \"overall wc points  (rank)\" for this row. The data shows that it's \"293  (4)\". \n\nThe claim states that the overall wc point should be \"393 (4)\", but in reality, it's \"293 (4)\". Therefore, the numbers don't match up. There's a discrepancy between what the claim expects and what the table shows.\n\nSo, because the actual value is 293 instead of 393, the claim is not supported by the data. Thus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"overall wc points  (rank)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2nd  (m)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The goal is to determine if the claim about Gregor Schlierenzauer is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"Gregor schlierenzauer have a 1st (m) greater than 124.5 and a 2nd (m) greater than 136\". \n\nI need to check each part of this statement against the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the JSON structure, I see that the table has columns: rank, name, nationality, 1st (m), 2nd (m), points, overall wc points (rank). The relevant columns for this claim are \"1st (m)\" and \"2nd (m)\". \n\nNow, let's find Gregor Schlierenzauer in the data. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: Andreas k\u00e4ttel\n- Row 1: Gregor schlierenzauer\n- Rows 2,3,4: Other names.\n\nSo Gregor is in row index 1.\n\nNow, checking his \"1st (m)\" value: it's 124.5. The claim says this should be greater than 124.5. But 124.5 is not greater than itself; it's equal. So this part of the claim isn't satisfied.\n\nNext, looking at his \"2nd (m)\" value: it's 136.0. The claim states it needs to be greater than 136. Again, 136.0 is exactly 136, not greater. Therefore, this condition also fails.\n\nSince both conditions in the claim are not met, the overall answer should be FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are the \"1st (m)\" and \"2nd (m)\" entries of Gregor Schlierenzauer, which are in row 1.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"1st (m)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2nd (m)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
