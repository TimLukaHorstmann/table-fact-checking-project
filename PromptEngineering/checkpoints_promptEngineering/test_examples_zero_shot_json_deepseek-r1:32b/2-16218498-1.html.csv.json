    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says that \"saint - louis fc game have the highest combined agg of any of the featured game.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what's in the table. Each row represents a game between two teams with their aggregate scores and each leg's score.\n\nThe columns are: team 1, agg (aggregate), team 2, 1st leg, 2nd leg.\n\nI think \"agg\" is the total from both legs, but I should check all rows to see what the aggregates are. \n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0:\n- Team 1: botswana defence force xi\n- agg: 1 - 2 (so total goals for team 1: 1, team 2: 2)\nCombined agg is 3.\n\nRow 1:\n- Team 1: arsenal (maseru)\n- agg: 4 - 0\nTotal goals: 4. Combined is 4.\n\nRow 2:\n- cd el\u00e1 nguema vs primeiro de agosto\n- agg: 2 - 6\nCombined: 8.\n\nRow 3:\n- lprc oilers vs mighty blackpool\n- agg: 2 - 3\nCombined:5.\n\nRow 4:\n- asc police vs as real bamako\n- agg: 2 - 2 (penalty shootout, but the numbers before are 2 each. So total is 4.\n\nRow 5:\n- port autonome vs sporting clube da praia\n- agg: 0 - 0 with a shootout. Combined goals are 0.\n\nRow 6:\n- saint - george sa vs al ittihad\n- agg: 2 - 4. Combined is 6.\n\nRow 7:\n- saint - louis fc vs young africans\n- agg: 2 -7. Combined is 9.\n\nRow 8:\n- sahel sc vs postel sport\n- agg:4 -2. Combined is 6.\n\nRow 9:\n- tourbillon fc vs forces arm\u00e9es ca\n- agg:1 -1. Combined is 2.\n\nSo, the claim is about saint - louis fc's game having the highest combined agg. Looking at row 7, the agg is 2 -7 for a total of 9. \n\nNow, checking other rows to see if any have higher than 9. The next highest I saw was row 2 with 8, and row 6 with 6, then row 8 with 6, etc. So yes, 9 is the highest.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because Saint-Louis FC's game has the highest combined aggregate of 9 goals compared to all other games in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the 4th game on the list be a higher scoring game than the sixth game on the list\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what constitutes a \"higher scoring game.\" Typically, this would mean that the total number of goals scored in one game is more than in another. In football (soccer), each game has two legs, and sometimes aggregate scores are considered. The table provides both the aggregate score (\"agg\") and the two legs' results for each match.\n\nThe claim refers to the 4th and 6th games on the list. Since the data is provided in a JSON format with an array under \"data,\" I should index them starting from 0. So, the 4th game would be at row_index 3 (since indexing starts at 0) and the 6th game at row_index 5.\n\nLet me look up these rows:\n\n- Row 3: lprc oilers vs mighty blackpool\n  - agg: 2 - 3\n  - 1st leg: 1 - 0\n  - 2nd leg: 1 - 3\n\n- Row 5: port autonome vs sporting clube da praia\n  - agg: 0 - 0 (1 - 3)\n  - 1st leg: 0 - 0\n  - 2nd leg: 0 - 0\n\nNow, I need to calculate the total goals for each game. For the aggregate score, it's usually the sum of both legs.\n\nFor row 3:\n- agg is already given as 2-3, but let me check the legs.\n- 1st leg: lprc oilers scored 1, mighty blackpool scored 0 \u2192 total so far 1-0\n- 2nd leg: lprc oilers scored 1, mighty blackpool scored 3 \u2192 total for this leg 1-3\nAdding both legs: (1+1) - (0+3) = 2 - 3. So the aggregate is correct.\n\nFor row 5:\n- agg is 0-0 with a penalty shootout result of 1-3.\n- Legs are both 0-0, so total goals in two legs are 0 for each team.\n\nNow, to determine which game had higher scoring, I should compare the total goals scored in each game. \n\nIn row 3 (4th game), the aggregate is 2-3, meaning a total of 5 goals (2+3). In row 5 (6th game), both legs ended 0-0, so total goals are 0.\n\nTherefore, the 4th game had more goals than the 6th game. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells for this comparison would be the \"agg\" column of each respective row because that directly shows the aggregate score which indicates the total goals scored in both legs combined.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"there be only 2 game where the score be 0 - 0 for the 1st leg\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break down the steps.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim is saying. It's stating that in the first leg of some games, the score was exactly 0-0, and there are only two such instances.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a game between two teams. The relevant columns for this claim would be \"1st leg\" since that's where the scores for the first match are listed.\n\nI'll go through each row in the data array and check the value under the \"1st leg\" column.\n\nRow 0: Team 1 is \"botswana defence force xi\", Team 2 is \"mbabane highlanders\". The 1st leg score is \"1 - 1\". Not 0-0. So this doesn't count.\n\nRow 1: Teams are \"arsenal (maseru)\" and \"eleven arrows fc\". 1st leg score is \"3 - 0\". Again, not 0-0.\n\nRow 2: Team 1 is \"cd el\u00e1 nguema\" vs \"primeiro de agosto\". The 1st leg is \"2 - 3\". Not matching.\n\nRow 3: \"lprc oilers\" vs \"mighty blackpool\" with a 1st leg of \"1 - 0\". No match.\n\nRow 4: \"asc police\" against \"as real bamako\", 1st leg is \"1 - 1\". Still not 0-0.\n\nRow 5: \"port autonome\" vs \"sporting clube da praia\". Here, the 1st leg score is \"0 - 0\". This matches the claim. So that's one instance.\n\nRow 6: \"saint george sa\" vs \"al ittihad\", 1st leg is \"2 - 1\". Not matching.\n\nRow 7: \"saint louis fc\" vs \"young africans\", 1st leg is \"1 - 3\". Doesn't fit.\n\nRow 8: \"sahel sc\" against \"postel sport\", 1st leg is \"2 - 1\". Not 0-0.\n\nRow 9: \"tourbillon fc\" vs \"forces arm\u00e9es ca\". The 1st leg score is \"0 - 0\". That's the second match. So, now we've found two instances where the 1st leg was 0-0.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check each row to make sure I didn't miss any other cases. Rows 5 and 9 are the only ones with \"0 - 0\" in the 1st leg column. All others have different scores.\n\nSo, according to this, there are exactly two games where the first leg score was 0-0. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells that support this conclusion are row 5 and row 9 under the \"1st leg\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim \"botswana defence force xi have a lower agg than arsenal (maseru)\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what 'agg' stands for in this context. Looking at the table's columns: team 1, agg, team 2, 1st leg, and 2nd leg. It makes sense that 'agg' refers to the aggregate score of the match between team 1 and team 2.\n\nSo, the claim is comparing the aggregate scores (agg) of two teams: Botswana Defence Force XI and Arsenal (Maseru). I need to find their respective agg values from the table.\n\nLooking at the data array:\n\n- The first row has \"botswana defence force xi\" as team 1 with an agg of \"1 - 2\" against \"mbabane highlanders\".\n- The second row lists \"arsenal (maseru)\" as team 1 with an agg of \"4 - 0\" against \"eleven arrows fc\".\n\nNow, I need to compare these agg scores. In the context of football matches, the aggregate score is usually the total goals scored by each team over both legs.\n\nFor Botswana Defence Force XI: their agg is 1-2. This means they scored 1 goal and conceded 2.\nFor Arsenal (Maseru): their agg is 4-0. They scored 4 goals and didn't concede any.\n\nThe claim states that Botswana has a lower agg than Arsenal. Since lower can mean different things here, but typically in sports, the team with fewer points loses. However, in terms of total goals scored, 1 for Botswana vs. 4 for Arsenal means Botswana has a lower score. But if we consider the outcome (win/loss), Arsenal won 4-0 while Botswana lost 1-2. \n\nWait, but the claim is about their agg scores relative to each other, not just whether they won or lost. So comparing their total goals scored:\n\nBotswana Defence Force XI: 1 goal\nArsenal (Maseru): 4 goals\n\nSo yes, 1 is lower than 4. Therefore, Botswana has a lower aggregate score than Arsenal.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells in the JSON table. \n\nFor Botswana Defence Force XI:\n- Row index 0\n- Column \"agg\"\n\nFor Arsenal (Maseru):\n- Row index 1\n- Column \"agg\"\n\nSo the relevant cells are row 0 and column \"agg\" for Botswana, and row 1 and column \"agg\" for Arsenal.\n\nPutting it all together, since Botswana's agg is indeed lower than Arsenal's, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the botswana defence force xi and the asc police game have the same 1st leg score.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the problem step by step.\n\nI know that the table has columns named \"team 1\", \"agg\", \"team 2\", \"1st leg\", and \"2nd leg\". So, for each row, there are two teams playing against each other in both legs (probably home and away matches), and their scores are recorded under \"1st leg\" and \"2nd leg\".\n\nThe claim is about the \"1st leg\" score of two specific games: one involving Botswana Defence Force XI and another involving Asc Police.\n\nI'll start by finding the row that includes Botswana Defence Force XI. Looking through the data array:\n\n- The first row has \"botswana defence force xi\" as team 1, with \"mbabane highlanders\" as team 2. Their scores are in the \"1st leg\" and \"2nd leg\". Specifically, the \"1st leg\" is \"1 - 1\".\n\nNext, I'll look for the row that includes Asc Police:\n\n- The fifth row has \"asc police\" as team 1 facing \"as real bamako\". The \"1st leg\" score here is \"1 - 1\".\n\nSo both teams have a \"1st leg\" score of \"1 - 1\". \n\nNow, I need to ensure that these are the correct rows.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says: \"the game between team 1 saint - louis fc and team 2 eleven arrow fc have the highest combined agg compare to any featured game\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It's about a table where each row represents a match between two teams. Each row has columns for Team 1, Aggregate score (agg), Team 2, 1st leg, and 2nd leg scores.\n\nThe claim is about whether the game between saint-louis fc (team 1) and eleven arrows fc (team 2) has the highest combined aggregate compared to any other game in the table. So I need to find their combined agg score and see if it's higher than all others.\n\nLooking at the data, each row's \"agg\" column shows the total goals for both teams. For example, the first row is 1-2, which means team 1 scored 1 and team 2 scored 2 in aggregate.\n\nI need to check each row to find the combined agg scores:\n\nRow 0: 1 + 2 = 3\nRow 1: 4 + 0 = 4 (Arsenal vs Eleven Arrows)\nRow 2: 2 +6=8\nRow3:2+3=5\nRow4:2+2=4, but wait, it's 2-2 with a penalty shootout: 4-5. So the aggregate is still 2+2=4.\nRow5:0+0=0 (but in the agg column, it's 0-0 with a shootout 1-3. Still, combined goals are 0.)\nRow6:2+4=6\nRow7:2+7=9\nRow8:4+2=6\nRow9:1+1=2\n\nWait, wait. The claim is about saint-louis fc and eleven arrows fc. But looking at the table, row1 has team 1 as arsenal (maseru) vs eleven arrows fc. So in row1, the agg is 4-0, meaning team1 scored 4, team2 0.\n\nBut where is saint-louis fc? Looking through the rows, I see row7: team1 is saint-louis fc, and team2 is young africans. The agg is 2-7, so combined 9 goals.\n\nWait, but in row7, the teams are saint-louis vs young africans, not eleven arrows. So the claim says the game between saint-louis (team1) and eleven arrows (team2). But in the table, I don't see a match where team2 is eleven arrows when team1 is saint-louis.\n\nLooking at row1: team1 is arsenal, team2 is eleven arrows. The agg is 4-0. So their combined is 4.\n\nIn row7, team1 is saint-louis vs young africans, which has an agg of 2-7 (combined 9). \n\nSo the claim says the game between saint-louis and eleven arrows has the highest combined agg. But in reality, I don't see such a match where these two teams are facing each other. Instead, there's a match between arsenal and eleven arrows with a combined agg of 4, which is not high compared to row7's 9.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because saint-louis fc isn't playing against eleven arrows in any row. The highest combined agg is 9 from row7.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a non-existent match between saint-louis fc and eleven arrows fc. The actual highest combined aggregate is 9 in another game.

The claim says: \"port autonome versus sport clube da praia have higher score than of lprc oiler versus mighty blackpool.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim refers to. It seems like it's comparing two matches and their scores.\n\nI'll start by looking for the relevant rows in the table that mention \"port autonome\" and \"sport clube da praia.\" Scanning through the data, I see a row where team 1 is \"port autonome\" and team 2 is \"sporting clube da praia.\" The aggregate score (agg) for this match is listed as \"0 - 0 (1 - 3).\" So, the overall result is a loss in the penalty shootout since the parentheses indicate that.\n\nNext, I need to find the row with \"lprc oilers\" versus \"mighty blackpool.\" Looking through the data, there's a row where team 1 is \"lprc oilers\" and team 2 is \"mighty blackpool.\" The aggregate score here is \"2 - 3,\" meaning that lprc oilers lost by one goal.\n\nThe claim compares whether port autonome vs. sport clube da praia have a higher score than lprc oiler vs. mighty blackpool. I think this refers to the total goals scored in each match. For port autonome, their aggregate is \"0 - 0 (1 - 3),\" so the actual goals before penalties were 0-0. The penalty shootout doesn't count towards the aggregate score in terms of goals; it's just a tiebreaker. So the total goals here are 0 + 0 = 0.\n\nFor lprc oilers vs. mighty blackpool, the aggregate is \"2 - 3,\" so the total goals scored by both teams combined are 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nComparing these totals, port autonome's match had 0 total goals, while lprc oiler's match had 5 total goals. Therefore, port autonome vs. sport clube da praia do not have a higher score than lprc oilers vs. mighty blackpool; in fact, it's the opposite.\n\nSo, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 5,\n       \"column_name\": \"agg\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 3,\n       \"column_name\": \"agg\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"botswana defence force xi have the lowest agg in the season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the table represents. The columns are: team 1, agg, team 2, 1st leg, and 2nd leg. The 'agg' column seems to represent the aggregate score for each match between two teams.\n\nThe claim is about botswana defence force xi having the lowest aggregate ('agg') in the season. So I need to check the 'agg' scores of all teams involved (both team1 and team2) and see if botswana's agg is indeed the lowest.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n- Row 0: botswana defence force xi vs mbabane highlanders with agg 1 - 2.\n- Row 1: arsenal (maseru) vs eleven arrows fc with agg 4 - 0.\n- Row 2: cd el\u00e1 nguema vs primeiro de agosto with agg 2 - 6.\n- Row 3: lprc oilers vs mighty blackpool with agg 2 - 3.\n- Row 4: asc police vs as real bamako with agg 2 - 2 (penalties).\n- Row 5: port autonome vs sporting clube da praia with agg 0 - 0 (penalties).\n- Row 6: saint - george sa vs al ittihad with agg 2 - 4.\n- Row 7: saint - louis fc vs young africans with agg 2 - 7.\n- Row 8: sahel sc vs postel sport with agg 4 - 2.\n- Row 9: tourbillon fc vs forces arm\u00e9es ca with agg 1 - 1.\n\nNow, for each row, I need to consider both team1 and team2's aggregate scores. The claim is about the lowest agg, so I'm looking for the smallest numbers in the 'agg' column.\n\nLooking at the first element of each 'agg':\n- Row0: 1\n- Row1:4\n- Row2:2\n- Row3:2\n- Row4:2 (since it's 2-2)\n- Row5:0 (since both scored 0, but with penalties)\n- Row6:2\n- Row7:2\n- Row8:4\n- Row9:1\n\nWait, row5 has an agg of 0 - 0, which is a draw. But the claim is about the lowest aggregate, so maybe considering the total goals or just the team's score.\n\nBut I think in football aggregates, each team's 'agg' is their total over both legs. So for example, in row0, team1 has 1 and team2 has 2.\n\nWait no, actually, looking at the data, the 'agg' column seems to be the combined score from both legs. For example, row0: \"1 - 2\" is the aggregate between team1 and team2.\n\nSo for each team in each match, their 'agg' would be either their own goals or the opponent's. But I'm not sure if we need to consider each team's individual agg or just the overall score.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at each row and see what the aggregate is for both teams involved. For example:\n\n- Row0: botswana has 1 goal, mbabane has 2.\n- Row1: arsenal has 4, eleven arrows have 0.\n- Row2: cd el\u00e1 nguema has 2, primeiro de agosto has6.\n- And so on.\n\nBut the claim is about whether botswana's aggregate is the lowest in the season. So I need to collect all the agg scores for each team across all their matches and find if botswana has the smallest one.\n\nWait, but looking at the data, each row represents a single match between two teams. Each team can appear multiple times as either team1 or team2.\n\nSo first, let's list all the aggregates for each team:\n\nbotswana defence force xi: in row0, their agg is 1 (since it's 1-2). So their score is 1.\n\narsenal (maseru): row1, they have 4 goals.\n\ncd el\u00e1 nguema: row2, 2 goals.\n\nlprc oilers: row3, 2 goals.\n\nasc police: row4, 2 goals (they drew 2-2).\n\nport autonome: row5, 0 goals (since it's 0-0 in aggregate but lost on penalties).\n\nsaint - george sa: row6, 2 goals.\n\nsaint - louis fc: row7, 2 goals.\n\nsahel sc: row8,4 goals.\n\ntourbillon fc: row9,1 goal.\n\nNow, looking for the lowest agg. The scores are:\n\nbotswana:1\n\narsenal:4\n\ncd el\u00e1 nguema:2\n\nlprc oilers:2\n\nasc police:2\n\nport autonome:0 (but is this correct? Because in the 'agg' column, it's 0-0 but lost on penalties. So their agg score is 0.\n\nWait, but does that mean port autonome has 0 goals? Or does the aggregate include both legs?\n\nLooking at row5: \"port autonome\" vs \"sporting clube da praia\", agg is 0 - 0 (1-3 on penalties). So in terms of goals, it's 0-0. But they lost on penalties, so perhaps their 'agg' is still considered as 0 for the purposes of this table.\n\nSo port autonome has an agg of 0.\n\nBut wait, in row5, both teams have 0 in aggregate. So each team would have 0 goals.\n\nSimilarly, in row9: tourbillon fc vs forces arm\u00e9es ca, agg is1-1. So both teams have 1 goal.\n\nSo compiling all the aggregates:\n\nbotswana:1\n\narsenal:4\n\ncd el\u00e1 nguema:2\n\nlprc oilers:2\n\nasc police:2 (because they scored 2 in their match)\n\nport autonome:0 (since agg is 0-0)\n\nsaint - george sa:2\n\nsaint - louis fc:2\n\nsahel sc:4\n\ntourbillon fc:1\n\nforces arm\u00e9es ca:1\n\nNow, looking for the lowest. The smallest is 0 by port autonome.\n\nWait, but in row5, both teams have agg of 0. So their individual aggs are 0 each.\n\nSo if we're considering the aggregate goals scored by each team across all matches they played, then botswana has 1, but port autonome has 0.\n\nBut wait, does each team play only once? Because in this data, each row is a separate match. So for example, botswana appears only once (row0), so their agg is 1. port autonome appears only once (row5) with agg 0.\n\nSo if the claim is about whether botswana has the lowest aggregate in the season, then no, because port autonome has a lower agg of 0.\n\nBut perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe each row represents a team's overall aggregate for the season? No, that doesn't make sense because each row has two teams.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the sum of goals scored by each team across all their matches in the season.\n\nWait, but without knowing how many matches each team played, we can't sum their goals. The data only shows a subset of matches.\n\nSo perhaps the question is about the aggregate score from both legs for each match, and which team has the lowest such score in any single match.\n\nIn that case, botswana's agg is 1 (from row0), port autonome's agg is 0 (row5). So port autonome has a lower score than botswana. Therefore, botswana is not the lowest.\n\nBut wait, in row5, both teams have 0, so perhaps it's considered that each team's agg is 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about which team's aggregate across all their matches is the lowest.\n\nIf we only look at the data given and assume these are all the matches for the season, then:\n\n- botswana:1\n- port autonome:0\n\nSo port autonome has a lower agg than botswana.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that no, botswana doesn't have the lowest aggregate. Port autonome does with 0.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's what the question is asking. The original task was:\n\n\"You are tasked with determining whether Botswana's aggregate score is the lowest in the season based on the given data.\"\n\nSo perhaps the answer depends on how we interpret the 'aggregate' for each team.\n\nIf the aggregate is per match, then botswana has 1 in their only match, port autonome has 0. So botswana isn't the lowest.\n\nAlternatively, if it's about the total across all matches, but since we don't have info on how many matches each played beyond what's shown, perhaps the question refers to the aggregate score in a particular match context.\n\nWait, looking back at the data:\n\nRow5: port autonome vs sporting clube da praia. The agg is 0 - 0 (penalties). So for this match, both teams have 0 goals each.\n\nBut does that mean their total goals across both legs sum to zero? Or did they score zero in aggregate?\n\nWait, no. In football, the aggregate is the total goals scored by each team across both legs of a tie. For example, if it's a two-legged match (home and away), the aggregate is team1's total vs team2's total.\n\nIn row5: 0 - 0 (1-3 on penalties). So in terms of goals, it was 0-0 over both legs, but they went to penalties. So their agg is 0 each.\n\nSo for that match, both teams have an aggregate score of 0.\n\nBut then, if we're looking at each team's aggregate across all matches in the season, and assuming each row represents a different competition (like different rounds), it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the individual match aggregates. So in their respective matches, which team has the lowest aggregate score.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- Row0: botswana 1, mba 2\n\nRow5: both 0.\n\nSo port autonome and sporting clube have 0 each.\n\nTherefore, botswana's aggregate is not the lowest; it's higher than 0.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the question is asking whether, in any match where Botswana participated, their aggregate was the lowest possible or lower than others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about comparing all teams' aggregates across all matches.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- botswana:1\n\nport autonome and sporting clube:0\n\ncd el\u00e1 e geomunda:2\n\nlprc oilers:2\n\nasc police:2\n\nsaint george sa:2\n\nsaint louis fc:2\n\nsahel sc:4\n\nforces armees ca:1\n\nSo the lowest aggregate is 0.\n\nTherefore, Botswana's aggregate is not the lowest.\n\nBut wait, in row5, both teams have 0. So perhaps the question is to find if Botswana has the lowest among all the teams' aggregates in their respective matches.\n\nIf so, then since some teams (port autonome and sporting clube) have 0, which is lower than botswana's 1, then no.\n\nBut without knowing the full dataset, it's hard to say. The given data only shows a subset of matches.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that each row represents a team's aggregate in their season, but that doesn't make sense because each row has two teams.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is: No, Botswana does not have the lowest aggregate score; there are teams with lower aggregates (e.g., 0).\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is about whether botswana's aggregate in their match was the lowest among all matches listed.\n\nIn that case, looking at all the aggs:\n\nRow0:1\n\nRow5:0 for both teams\n\nOthers have higher or equal.\n\nSo the lowest is 0, achieved by port autonome and sporting clube. Therefore, botswana's aggregate of 1 is not the lowest.\n</think>\n\nBased on the given data, Botswana does not have the lowest aggregate score in the season. There are teams, such as Port Autonome and Sporting Clube, whose aggregate scores are lower (0) than Botswana's (1).\n\nAnswer: No, Botswana's aggregate score is not the lowest in the season.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"there be more than 2 team that have the same score during the 1st leg\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the table represents. It looks like a sports tournament result table with columns: \"team 1\", \"agg\", \"team 2\", \"1st leg\", and \"2nd leg\". Each row shows the results of matches between two teams across both legs.\n\nThe claim is about the number of teams that had the same score during the first leg. So, I need to focus on the \"1st leg\" column and check how many unique scores there are.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: \"botswana defence force xi\" vs \"mbabane highlanders\" with a 1-1 result.\nRow 1: \"arsenal (maseru)\" vs \"eleven arrows fc\" with a 3-0 result.\nRow 2: \"cd el\u00e1 nguema\" vs \"primeiro de agosto\" with a 2-3 result.\nRow 3: \"lprc oilers\" vs \"mighty blackpool\" with a 1-0 result.\nRow 4: \"asc police\" vs \"as real bamako\" with a 1-1 result.\nRow 5: \"port autonome\" vs \"sporting clube da praia\" with a 0-0 result.\nRow 6: \"saint - george sa\" vs \"al ittihad\" with a 2-1 result.\nRow 7: \"saint - louis fc\" vs \"young africans\" with a 1-3 result.\nRow 8: \"sahel sc\" vs \"postel sport\" with a 2-1 result.\nRow 9: \"tourbillon fc\" vs \"forces arm\u00e9es ca\" with a 0-0 result.\n\nNow, let's list out all the 1st leg scores:\n\n1-1 (Row 0 and Row 4)\n3-0 (Row 1)\n2-3 (Row 2)\n1-0 (Row 3)\n2-1 (Row 6 and Row 8)\n1-3 (Row7)\n0-0 (Rows5 and9)\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. Each row has a single 1st leg score between two teams. So each row's \"1st leg\" is the result for team1 vs team2 in the first match.\n\nSo, compiling all the 1st leg scores:\n\nRow0: 1-1\nRow1:3-0\nRow2:2-3\nRow3:1-0\nRow4:1-1\nRow5:0-0\nRow6:2-1\nRow7:1-3\nRow8:2-1\nRow9:0-0\n\nNow, let's count how many times each score occurs:\n\n- 1-1 appears in Row0 and Row4 \u2192 2 teams (but wait, each row represents a match between two teams. So for each row, both teams have the same 1st leg score in that particular match.)\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim is about \"teams\" having the same score during the 1st leg across all matches.\n\nSo, perhaps it's counting how many unique scores exist. If there are more than two unique scores, then the claim would be true? Or wait, no\u2014the claim says \"more than 2 team that have the same score\". So it's about whether at least three different teams share the same score in their respective first legs.\n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify: each row is a match between two teams. Each of those two teams has a specific score in the first leg. The claim is asking if more than two teams (i.e., at least three) have the same score during the 1st leg across all matches.\n\nSo, for example, let's collect all the team's scores from the 1st leg.\n\nEach team's score would be either as team1 or team2 in each row. For each match, both teams' first leg results are known.\n\nLet me list each team and their 1st leg score:\n\nRow0: Botswana Defence Force XI - 1, Mbabane Highlanders -1\nRow1: Arsenal (maseru) -3, Eleven Arrows FC -0\nRow2: CD El\u00e1 Ng\u00fae Ma -2, Primeiro de Agosto -3\nRow3: LPRC Oilers -1, Mighty Blackpool -0\nRow4: ASC Police -1, AS Real Bamako -1\nRow5: Port Autonome -0, Sporting Clube da Praia -0\nRow6: Saint-George SA -2, Al Ittihad -1\nRow7: Saint-Louis FC -1, Young Africans -3\nRow8: Sahel SC -2, Postel Sport -1\nRow9: Tourbillon FC -0, Forces Arm\u00e9es CA -0\n\nNow, let's collect all these scores:\n\nFrom Row0:\n- Botswana Defence Force XI: 1\n- Mbabane Highlanders: 1\n\nRow1:\n- Arsenal (maseru):3\n- Eleven Arrows FC:0\n\nRow2:\n- CD El\u00e1 Ng\u00fae Ma:2\n- Primeiro de Agosto:3\n\nRow3:\n- LPRC Oilers:1\n- Mighty Blackpool:0\n\nRow4:\n- ASC Police:1\n- AS Real Bamako:1\n\nRow5:\n- Port Autonome:0\n- Sporting Clube da Praia:0\n\nRow6:\n- Saint-George SA:2\n- Al Ittihad:1\n\nRow7:\n- Saint-Louis FC:1\n- Young Africans:3\n\nRow8:\n- Sahel SC:2\n- Postel Sport:1\n\nRow9:\n- Tourbillon FC:0\n- Forces Arm\u00e9es CA:0\n\nNow, compiling all the scores:\n\nScore counts for each team:\n\nLooking at each score:\n\nScore 0:\nTeams:\nEleven Arrows FC (Row1)\nMighty Blackpool (Row3)\nPort Autonome (Row5)\nSporting Clube da Praia (Row5)\nTourbillon FC (Row9)\nForces Arm\u00e9es CA (Row9)\n\nWait, but actually, each row contributes two scores. So:\n\nScore 0 occurs for the following teams:\nEleven Arrows FC: 0\nMighty Blackpool:0\nPort Autonome:0\nSporting Clube da Praia:0\nTourbillon FC:0\nForces Arm\u00e9es CA:0\n\nWait, but each of these is a different team. So how many teams have score 0? It's 6 different teams.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nScore1:\nBotswana Defence Force XI (Row0)\nMbabane Highlanders (Row0)\nLPRC Oilers (Row3)\nASC Police (Row4)\nAS Real Bamako (Row4)\nSaint-Louis FC (Row7)\nAl Ittihad (Row6)\nPostel Sport (Row8)\n\nSo, score1 is achieved by 8 teams.\n\nScore2:\nCD El\u00e1 Ng\u00fae Ma (Row2)\nSaint-George SA (Row6)\nSahel SC (Row8)\n\nSo three teams have score2.\n\nScore3:\nArsenal (maseru) (Row1)\nPrimeiro de Agosto (Row2)\nYoung Africans (Row7)\n\nThree teams with score3.\n\nWait, but the claim is \"more than 2 team that have the same score during their first leg\". So does it mean that there exists a score where more than two teams achieved that score? In this case:\n\n- Score0:6 teams\n- Score1:8 teams\n- Score2:3 teams\n- Score3:3 teams\n\nSo yes, multiple scores are shared by more than two teams. For example, score0 is shared by 6 teams, which is way more than two.\n\nBut wait, the question might be whether a particular team has played against more than two other teams with the same first leg score? Or perhaps it's about how many unique team-score pairs exist where each pair (team, score) is considered. But I think that interpretation isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is whether any three different teams have the same 1st leg score across all matches. For example, if three different teams each had a score of 2 in their respective first legs, then yes. Looking at the data:\n\nScore2 was achieved by CD El\u00e1 Ng\u00fae Ma (Row2), Saint-George SA (Row6), Sahel SC (Row8). So that's three different teams with a 2-? result in their first leg.\n\nSimilarly, Score1 is achieved by many more than two teams.\n\nSo yes, there are multiple instances where more than two teams have the same score during their first leg. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe answer to the question is: Yes, there are more than two teams that have the same score in their first legs across the matches provided.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Task:** We need to determine if at least three different teams share the same score in their respective first leg matches.\n\n2. **Extracting Data:** From each row, we note both teams and their scores from the first leg:\n   - Row 0: Botswana Defence Force XI (1), Mbabane Highlanders (1)\n   - Row 1: Arsenal (3), Eleven Arrows FC (0)\n   - Row 2: CD El\u00e1 Ng\u00fae Ma (2), Primeiro de Agosto (3)\n   - Row 3: LPRC Oilers (1), Mighty Blackpool (0)\n   - Row 4: ASC Police (1), AS Real Bamako (1)\n   - Row 5: Port Autonome (0), Sporting Clube da Praia (0)\n   - Row 6: Saint-George SA (2), Al Ittihad (1)\n   - Row 7: Saint-Louis FC (1), Young Africans (3)\n   - Row 8: Sahel SC (2), Postel Sport (1)\n   - Row 9: Tourbillon FC (0), Forces Arm\u00e9es CA (0)\n\n3. **Compiling Scores by Team:** We list each team and their respective first leg scores.\n\n4. **Counting Teams per Score:**\n   - **Score 0:** Achieved by six different teams.\n   - **Score 1:** Achieved by eight different teams.\n   - **Score 2:** Achieved by three different teams (CD El\u00e1 Ng\u00fae Ma, Saint-George SA, Sahel SC).\n   - **Score 3:** Achieved by three different teams (Arsenal, Primeiro de Agosto, Young Africans).\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since both score2 and score3 are achieved by three or more distinct teams each, it confirms that there are indeed instances where more than two teams share the same first leg score.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{Yes}",
