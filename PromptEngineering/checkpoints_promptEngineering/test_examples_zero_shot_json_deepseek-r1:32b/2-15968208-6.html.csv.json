    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what's being claimed.\n\nThe claim says: \"the k\u00f6nig be the only ship hit with 13.5 inch round, it be hit with 7 of them.\" Hmm, okay. So there are two parts to this claim:\n\n1. K\u00f6nig is the only ship that was hit with 13.5-inch rounds.\n2. K\u00f6nig was hit with 7 of these rounds.\n\nFirst, I need to check what columns in the table relate to 13.5-inch rounds. Looking at the columns provided: \"ship\", \"13.5 - inch / 1400lb\", \"13.5 - inch / 1250lb\", \"12 - inch\", and \"total\". So, the two columns that mention 13.5-inch rounds are \"13.5 - inch / 1400lb\" and \"13.5 - inch / 1250lb\".\n\nNow, I need to check each row for these columns. The rows correspond to different ships: l\u00fctzow, derfflinger, seydlitz, kaiser (k\u00f6nig), markgraf, and total.\n\nLet me go through each ship:\n\n- **l\u00fctzow**: The values under the 13.5-inch columns are both 0. So no hits here.\n- **derfflinger**: Both 13.5-inch columns have 0 as well. No hits.\n- **seydlitz**: Again, both 13.5-inch columns show 0. No hits.\n- **kaiser (k\u00f6nig)**: Under \"13.5 - inch / 1400lb\" it's 7, and under \"13.5 - inch / 1250lb\" it's 1. So that's a total of 8 hits from 13.5-inch rounds. But the claim says 7. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim might be referring only to one type, but I think both are 13.5 inches with different weights.\n- **markgraf**: Both columns have 0 and 1. Wait, under \"13.5 - inch / 1250lb\" it's 1, so that means markgraf was hit once by a 13.5-inch round of 1250lb.\n- **Total row**: For 13.5-inch columns, it's 7 and 4 respectively, totaling 11.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says K\u00f6nig is the only ship hit with 13.5-inch rounds, but markgraf was also hit once under \"13.5 - inch / 1250lb\". That contradicts the first part of the claim that K\u00f6nig is the only one.\n\nAdditionally, the claim states that K\u00f6nig was hit with 7 of them. Looking at K\u00f6nig's row, it has 7 in the first 13.5-inch column and 1 in the second, totaling 8 hits. So if the claim refers to both types, then it's actually 8, not 7.\n\nSo, putting this together: The first part is false because markgraf was also hit with a 13.5-inch round. The second part is also false because K\u00f6nig had 8 hits, not 7.\n\nTherefore, the entire claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states two things about K\u00f6nig: it's the only ship hit with 13.5-inch rounds and that it was hit by exactly 7 of them. However, markgraf was also hit once with a 13.5-inch round, and K\u00f6nig had 8 hits in total. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"13.5 - inch / 1250lb\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"13.5 - inch / 1400lb\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. The columns are: \"ship\", \"13.5 - inch / 1400lb\", \"13.5 - inch / 1250lb\", \"12 - inch\", and \"total\". Each row represents a ship along with some numerical values under these columns.\n\nThe claim states that \"the l\u00fctzow, markgraf and k\u00f6nig be the only ship hit with 13.5 inch 1250lb fire.\" So, I need to check if these three ships are the only ones that have non-zero entries in the column \"13.5 - inch / 1250lb\".\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The row for \"l\u00fctzow\" has a value of 2 under \"13.5 - inch / 1250lb\".\n- The row for \"markgraf\" has a value of 1 under the same column.\n- The row for \"k\u00f6nig\" has a value of 7 under \"13.5 - inch / 1400lb\", but I need to check if it's also present in the 1250lb column. Wait, no, \"k\u00f6nig\" has 1 under \"13.5 - inch / 1250lb\".\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\nLooking at the data array:\n- The first row is l\u00fctzow: [0, 2, 8, 10]. So columns are 0 for 1400lb and 2 for 1250lb.\n- Markgraf: [0, 1, ...], so 1 in the 1250lb column.\n- K\u00f6nig: [7,1,0,...], so 7 in 1400lb, 1 in 1250lb.\n\nSo l\u00fctzow has 2, markgraf has 1, and k\u00f6nig has 1. So all three have hits under the 1250lb category.\n\nNow, are these the only ships with non-zero values in that column? Let's check each row:\n\n- derfflinger: [0,0,...], so nothing in either 13.5-inch columns.\n- seydlitz: same as above, zeros.\n- Total row shows 7 under 1400lb and 4 under 1250lb.\n\nWait, but the total for \"13.5 - inch / 1250lb\" is 4 (sum of l\u00fctzow's 2 + markgraf's 1 + k\u00f6nig's 1 = 4). That adds up correctly.\n\nSo the claim says that only these three ships have hits with 13.5 inch 1250lb fire. From the table, indeed, only l\u00fctzow (row 0), markgraf (row 4), and k\u00f6nig (row 3) have non-zero values in that column.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data as these three ships are the only ones with hits under the specified category.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"13.5 - inch / 1250lb\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"13.5 - inch / 1250lb\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"13.5 - inch / 1250lb\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the l\u00fctzow be hit 10 time , 2 time with a 13.5 inch 1250lb and 8 time with the 12 inch.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided in JSON format. The columns are:\n- \"ship\"\n- \"13.5  - inch / 1400lb\"\n- \"13.5  - inch / 1250lb\"\n- \"12  - inch\"\n- \"total\"\n\nThe data has six rows, each representing a ship and some numbers under these columns.\n\nI need to check if the claim is supported by the table. Let's break down the claim:\n\n1. The total hits on \"l\u00fctzow\" are 10.\n2. Out of these, 2 were with \"13.5 inch 1250lb\".\n3. And 8 were with \"12 inch\".\n\nLooking at the rows in the data, the first row is for \"l\u00fctzow\". The columns correspond to:\n\n- 13.5-inch /1400lb: 0\n- 13.5-inch /1250lb: 2\n- 12-inch: 8\n- total: 10\n\nSo, the claim states that l\u00fctzow was hit 10 times in total. According to the table, under \"total\", it's indeed 10. That matches.\n\nNext, for the specific types of hits:\n\n- The column \"13.5 - inch / 1250lb\" has a value of 2 for l\u00fctzow. So, there were 2 hits with this type.\n- The \"12-inch\" column shows 8 hits. That also matches.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions \"13.5 inch 1250lb\" and \"12 inch\". In the table, these are separate columns, which is correct. So all parts of the claim align with the data in the table.\n\nI should double-check if there's any discrepancy. For example, does the claim mention hits from other categories? It doesn't; it only refers to 13.5/1250lb and 12-inch. The total adds up correctly (2 +8=10), so everything seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as all specified values match the corresponding cells in the table for \"l\u00fctzow\".\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"13.5  - inch / 1250lb\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"12  - inch\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. So, first, I'll read through the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe table is in JSON format with columns: \"ship\", \"13.5-inch / 1400lb\", \"13.5-inch / 1250lb\", \"12-inch\", and \"total\". The data rows are for different ships, each with numbers under these columns and a total at the end.\n\nThe claim says: \"a total of 23 round hit the ship, l\u00fctzow be hit the most with 10 and k\u00f6nig be hit 8 time.\"\n\nOkay, so I need to check three things here:\n\n1. Does the table show that there's a total of 23 hits?\n2. Is L\u00fctzow the one hit the most with 10 hits?\n3. Was K\u00f6nig hit 8 times?\n\nStarting with the first point: Total hits are given in the \"total\" column for each ship, and at the end, the overall total is listed as 23 under the \"total\" row. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, looking at L\u00fctzow's data. The claim says it was hit the most with 10. Looking at the table, in the first data row (index 0), the ship is \"l\u00fctzow\", and its total is 10. That seems correct. So yes, L\u00fctzow has the highest number of hits mentioned.\n\nThen, checking K\u00f6nig. The claim states it was hit 8 times. Looking at the fourth row (index 3) for \"k\u00f6nig\", the total is indeed 8. So that also checks out.\n\nWait a second, I should make sure there are no other ships with higher totals than L\u00fctzow's 10. Let me look through all the rows:\n\n- l\u00fctzow: 10\n- derfflinger: 3\n- seydlitz: 1\n- k\u00f6nig: 8\n- markgraf: 1\n\nSo yes, L\u00fctzow is hit the most with 10. K\u00f6nig comes next with 8. The total across all ships adds up to 23 as stated.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies here. Each part of the claim matches what's in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this table in JSON format and a claim to verify: \"the markgraf and seydlitz be both only hit 1 time.\" My task is to determine if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. The columns are \"ship,\" \"13.5-inch / 1400lb,\" \"13.5-inch / 1250lb,\" \"12-inch,\" and \"total.\" The rows list different ships with some numerical values under these columns.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific ships: markgraf and seydlitz. I need to find their respective rows in the data array. Looking at the data, each row starts with the ship's name followed by four numbers corresponding to the columns. \n\nFor \"markgraf,\" looking through the rows, I find it at index 4. The values are [0, 1, 0, 1]. Similarly, \"seydlitz\" is at index 2 with values [0, 0, 1, 1].\n\nNow, the claim says both were hit only once. Looking at each ship's data, I should check if any of their numerical values equal 1 because that might indicate hits.\n\nStarting with markgraf:\n- Column 0: \"13.5-inch / 1400lb\" has a value of 0.\n- Column 1: \"13.5-inch / 1250lb\" is 1.\n- Column 2: \"12-inch\" is 0.\n- Column 3: Total is 1.\n\nSo, markgraf's data shows one hit in the second column and a total of 1. That seems to align with being hit once.\n\nNext, seydlitz:\n- Column 0: 0\n- Column 1: 0\n- Column 2: 1\n- Column 3: Total is 1.\n\nHere, seydlitz has one hit in the third column and a total of 1. So that also seems like it was hit once.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if \"total\" being 1 indicates just one hit or something else. The total might be the sum of all hits across different columns. For markgraf: 0 +1 +0 +1 = 2? But wait, in the row for markgraf, the total is 1. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait no, looking again at the data structure. Each row's last value is \"total.\" So for markgraf, it's [0,1,0,1]. That means the sum of hits across all columns should be 1. But adding up the first three columns: 0+1+0=1, which matches the total.\n\nSimilarly, seydlitz has [0,0,1,1], so 0+0+1=1, matching the total. So both have a total of 1 hit each.\n\nWait, but in markgraf's case, the second column is 1 and the fourth (total) is 1. Does that mean one hit? Yes, because 0 +1 +0 =1. Similarly for seydlitz: 0+0+1=1. So both have exactly one hit each.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"the markgraf and seydlitz be both only hit 1 time\" is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both \"markgraf\" and \"seydlitz\" were hit only once each. By examining their respective rows in the table:\n\n- **markgraf**: Located at row index 4, with values [0, 1, 0, 1]. The total hits are 1.\n- **seydlitz**: Located at row index 2, with values [0, 0, 1, 1]. The total hits are also 1.\n\nBoth ships indeed have a total of 1 hit each. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

My task is to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data presented.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table structure. The columns are \"ship\", \"13.5 - inch / 1400lb\", \"13.5 - inch / 1250lb\", \"12 - inch\", and \"total\". Each row under these columns represents a different ship along with numerical values.\n\nThe claim in question is: \"the k\u00f6nig be not hit with any 13.5 inch / 1400 lb round.\" So, I need to check if the ship named \"k\u00f6nig\" has zero hits from 13.5-inch rounds that weigh 1400 lbs.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n- The first row is \"l\u00fctzow\", with values [0, 2, 8, 10].\n- The second row is \"derfflinger\", with [0, 0, 3, 3].\n- The third row is \"seydlitz\", with [0, 0, 1, 1].\n- The fourth row is \"k\u00f6nig\", with values [7, 1, 0, 8].\n- The fifth row is \"markgraf\", with [0, 1, 0, 1].\n- The last row is the total, which I can ignore for this specific claim.\n\nNow, focusing on \"k\u00f6nig\" (row index 3). The columns relevant to 13.5-inch rounds are two: \"13.5 - inch / 1400lb\" and \"13.5 - inch / 1250lb\". These correspond to the second and third columns in the data array.\n\nFor \"k\u00f6nig\", under \"13.5 - inch / 1400lb\" (which is the second column), the value is 7, and under \"13.5 - inch / 1250lb\" (third column) it's 1. The claim specifically mentions the 13.5-inch rounds weighing 1400 lbs, so I'm looking at the second column.\n\nSince \"k\u00f6nig\" has a value of 7 under this column, that means it was hit seven times with 13.5-inch / 1400 lb rounds. Therefore, the claim that \"k\u00f6nig be not hit with any 13.5 inch / 1400 lb round\" is false.\n\nSo, I'll mark the answer as FALSE and note the relevant cells: row index 3 under both columns related to 13.5-inch rounds.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"13.5 - inch / 1400lb\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"13.5 - inch / 1250lb\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"the derfflinger be the only ship hit with 13.5 inch 1250 lb fire\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. The columns are:\n- \"ship\"\n- \"13.5-inch / 1400lb\"\n- \"13.5-inch / 1250lb\"\n- \"12-inch\"\n- \"total\"\n\nLooking at the data rows, there's a list of ships and their corresponding counts under each column.\n\nThe claim is about derfflinger being the only ship hit with a specific type of fire: 13.5 inch and 1250 lb. So I need to check two things:\n1. Does derfflinger have any hits in the \"13.5-inch / 1250lb\" column?\n2. Are there any other ships besides derfflinger that also have hits in this column?\n\nLooking at the data, the rows are indexed from 0 to 5. The ships are listed as follows:\n- Row 0: l\u00fctzow\n- Row 1: derfflinger\n- Row 2: seydlitz\n- Row 3: kaiser\n- Row 4: markgraf\n- Row 5: total\n\nFor each ship, let's check the \"13.5-inch / 1250lb\" column. The columns are in order, so \"13.5-inch / 1400lb\" is index 1 and \"13.5-inch / 1250lb\" is index 2.\n\n- l\u00fctzow (row 0): Column 2 has a value of 2.\n- derfflinger (row 1): Column 2 has a value of 0.\n- seydlitz (row 2): Column 2 is 0.\n- kaiser (row 3): Column 2 is 1.\n- markgraf (row 4): Column 2 is 1.\n- total: Column 2 is 4.\n\nWait, so derfflinger has 0 in that column. That means they were not hit with 13.5 inch / 1250lb fire. But the claim says derfflinger was the only ship hit with that type of fire. However, looking at other rows:\n\n- l\u00fctzow had 2 hits.\n- kaiser had 1.\n- markgraf also had 1.\n\nSo multiple ships were hit in that category, not just derfflinger. But wait, derfflinger actually has 0 in that column, meaning they weren't hit at all with that type. So the claim is incorrect because derfflinger wasn't even hit with 13.5 inch / 1250lb fire; instead, other ships were.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n- For derfflinger: row 1, column \"13.5-inch / 1250lb\" (value 0)\n- For l\u00fctzow: row 0, same column (value 2)\n- For kaiser: row 3, value 1\n- For markgraf: row 4, value 1\n\nBut the claim specifically says derfflinger was the only one. Since derfflinger has 0 and others have non-zero values, the claim is FALSE.\n\nSo I'll note the relevant cells as row 1 for derfflinger in that column and maybe at least one other ship with a hit to show it's not unique.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because derfflinger wasn't hit by any 13.5-inch / 1250lb fire, while other ships were.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"13.5-inch / 1250lb\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"13.5-inch / 1250lb\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim about L\u00fctzow being hit 16 times in total, mostly with 13.5-inch 1400lb shells, is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. The columns are \"ship\", \"13.5-inch/1400lb\", \"13.5-inch/1250lb\", \"12-inch\", and \"total\". Each row represents a ship with counts under these categories.\n\nThe claim says L\u00fctzow was hit 16 times in total. I should check the 'total' column for L\u00fctzow. Looking at the data, the rows are:\n\n0: l\u00fctzow - 0,2,8,10\nSo, the total hits for l\u00fctzow is 10, not 16. That's a discrepancy.\n\nNext part of the claim says it was \"mostly with 13.5-inch 1400lb\". The columns have two types under 13.5-inch: one at 1400lb and another at 1250lb. For L\u00fctzow, the counts are 0 in the 13.5/1400lb column and 2 in the 13.5/1250lb column. So, only 2 hits with 13.5-inch shells total (both types combined), which is much less than the total of 10.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect: the total hits are 10, not 16, and only 2 were from 13.5-inch shells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that L\u00fctzow was hit 16 times in total with mostly 13.5-inch 1400lb shells. Checking the table:\n\n- The 'total' column for L\u00fctzow shows 10 hits, not 16.\n- Under \"13.5-inch/1400lb\", there are 0 hits, and under \"13.5-inch/1250lb\" there are 2 hits.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"13.5 - inch  / 1400lb\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"13.5 - inch  / 1250lb\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"6 round total hit all of the ships with the seydlitz hit the most of all the ship.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse each part of this claim. The main points are:\n1. There are 6 rounds in total.\n2. Each ship was hit.\n3. Seydlitz had the most hits.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are \"ship\", \"13.5-inch / 1400lb\", \"13.5-inch / 1250lb\", \"12-inch\", and \"total\". The last column is labeled \"total\", which I assume represents the total hits per ship.\n\nThe rows represent different ships:\n- l\u00fctzow\n- derfflinger\n- seydlitz\n- k\u00f6nig\n- markgraf\n- total\n\nLet me check each point:\n\n1. **Total Rounds (6):** The claim mentions 6 rounds. However, looking at the \"total\" column for each ship and the overall total row:\n   - l\u00fctzow: 10\n   - derfflinger: 3\n   - seydlitz: 1\n   - k\u00f6nig: 8\n   - markgraf: 1\n   - Total: 23\n\n   The \"total\" row's last cell is 23, which sums up all individual ship totals. So there are 23 hits in total, not 6. This contradicts the claim.\n\n2. **All Ships Hit:** The claim says each ship was hit. Let me check each ship's total:\n   - l\u00fctzow: 10 (hit)\n   - derfflinger: 3 (hit)\n   - seydlitz: 1 (hit)\n   - k\u00f6nig: 8 (hit)\n   - markgraf: 1 (hit)\n\n   All ships have non-zero totals, so each was hit. This part is correct.\n\n3. **Seydlitz Hit the Most:** Comparing the totals:\n   - l\u00fctzow: 10\n   - derfflinger: 3\n   - seydlitz: 1\n   - k\u00f6nig: 8\n   - markgraf: 1\n\n   The highest total is 10 for l\u00fctzow. Seydlitz only has 1 hit, which is the least. So this part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nSince the first and third points are false while the second is true, but the overall claim combines all three parts, it doesn't hold entirely. The presence of multiple inaccuracies means the claim isn't fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the table. The columns are \"ship\", \"13.5-inch / 1400lb\", \"13.5-inch / 1250lb\", \"12-inch\", and \"total\". Each row represents a different ship, with some numerical values under each column.\n\nThe claim states that both markgraf and seydlitz were hit several times by rounds of various sizes. I need to check if their corresponding cells in the table support this.\n\nLooking at the rows for markgraf (row index 4) and seydlitz (row index 2):\n\n- For markgraf:\n  - Column \"13.5-inch / 1400lb\": 0\n  - Column \"13.5-inch / 1250lb\": 1\n  - Column \"12-inch\": 0\n  - Total: 1\n\n- For seydlitz:\n  - Column \"13.5-inch / 1400lb\": 0\n  - Column \"13.5-inch / 1250lb\": 0\n  - Column \"12-inch\": 1\n  - Total: 1\n\nThe claim mentions being hit \"several times,\" which I interpret as more than once or multiple hits. However, looking at the values:\n\n- Markgraf has a total of 1 hit across all columns.\n- Seydlitz also has a total of 1 hit.\n\nSince both have only one hit each, it doesn't support the claim of being hit several times with rounds of various sizes. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe markgraf and seydlitz each received only one hit, which does not meet the claim of being hit several times.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"13.5  - inch / 1400lb\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"13.5  - inch / 1250lb\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"12  - inch\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"13.5  - inch / 1400lb\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"13.5  - inch / 1250lb\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"12  - inch\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
