His political party is also listed as \"socialist party of albania.\" Correct again.\n\n3. **Ylli Bufi**: Ylli_bufi's row is index 2, and his party is \"socialist party of albania\" as per the table.

The claim says: \"the term start for bashkim fino be after the term start for vilson ahmeti.\" So, I need to compare when each of these two prime ministers started their terms.\n\nFirst, let's find Bashkim Fino in the table. Looking at the data rows, I see that Bashkim Fino is listed on row 5 (index starts from 0, so that would be row index 5). The \"term start\" for him is \"11 march 1997\".\n\nNext, Vilson Ahmeti's term start is in row 3. His term started on \"10 december 1991\". \n\nNow, comparing the two dates: December 1991 versus March 1997. Clearly, March 1997 comes after December 1991. So, Bashkim Fino's term did start after Vilson Ahmeti's.\n\nTo verify, I'll note the relevant cells:\n- For Bashkim Fino: row index 5, column \"term start\".\n- For Vilson Ahmeti: row index 3, column \"term start\".\n\nBoth these cells confirm that the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"term start\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"term start\"}\n   ]\n}",

The claim is: \"the term end for vilson ahmeti be after the term end for ylli bufi.\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the table. It has columns like name, born-died, term start, term end, and political party. The data rows include various prime ministers with their respective details.\n\nThe claim compares two individuals: Vilson Ahmeti and Ylli Bufi. Specifically, it's about whether Vilson Ahmeti's term end is after Ylli Bufi's term end. So I need to find the term end dates for both of them from the table.\n\nLooking through the data array:\n\n- The first row seems to be a header or a placeholder because all cells are \"prime ministers 1991 onwards\". So I can skip that.\n- The second row is about Fatos Nano (1st time), so not relevant here.\n- The third row is Ylli Bufi. His term end is listed as \"10 december 1991\".\n- The fourth row is Vilson Ahmeti, whose term end is \"13 april 1992\".\n\nNow I need to compare these two dates. December 1991 comes before April 1992. So Vilson Ahmeti's term ended in April 1992, which is after Ylli Bufi's term end in December 1991.\n\nWait, but the claim says that Vilson Ahmeti's term end is after Ylli Bufi's. Since April 1992 comes after December 1991, that would make the claim TRUE.\n\nLet me double-check the relevant cells to ensure I'm not making a mistake. For Ylli Bufi (row index 2), under 'term end' it's \"10 december 1991\". For Vilson Ahmeti (row index 3), 'term end' is \"13 april 1992\". Comparing these, April comes after December in the same year. So yes, 1992 is later than 1991, so April 1992 is indeed after December 1991.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"term end\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"term end\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"sali berisha be the first person since aleksand\u00ebr meksi, to be elect as a member of the democratic party of albania political party.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. It seems there's a possible typo in \"be\" which might be intended as \"became.\" So the corrected claim is that Sali Berisha was the first person since Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi to become a member elected from the Democratic Party of Albania.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check two main points:\n\n1. Who are the Prime Ministers and their political parties.\n2. Determine if there were any other members from the Democratic Party between Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi's term and Sali Berisha's term.\n\nStarting with Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi: From the table, row 4 (index 3 in JSON) shows that Aleksander Meksi was Prime Minister from April 1992 to March 1997 under the Democratic Party of Albania. \n\nNext, looking at who came after him until Sali Berisha:\n\n- Bashkim Fino (row 5, index 4): Socialist Party\n- Fatos Nano (twice: rows 6 and 10, indexes 5 and 9): Socialist Party\n- Pandeli Majko (twice: rows 7 and 11, indexes 6 and 10): Socialist Party\n- Ilir Meta (row 8, index 7): Socialist Party\n- Fatos Nano again (row 10, index 9)\n- Then Sali Berisha (row 11, index 10) from the Democratic Party\n\nSo between Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi's term ending in March 1997 and Sali Berisha starting in September 2005, all Prime Ministers were from the Socialist Party except for Fatos Nano. However, Fatos Nano is listed under the Socialist Party as well, even when he was elected again later.\n\nThus, there were no other members from the Democratic Party of Albania holding the position between Meksi and Berisha. Therefore, Sali Berisha would indeed be the first since Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi to be elected as a member of the Democratic Party for the Prime Minister role.\n\nThe relevant cells in the table are those that list the political parties for each Prime Minister after Meksi until Berisha. Specifically:\n\n- For Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi: row 4 (index 3) under \"political party.\"\n- For each subsequent PM up to Sali Berisha, checking their political party.\n\nSo the relevant rows would be indices 5 through 10, all in the \"political party\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. The columns are: name, born - died, term start, term end, and political party. Each row represents a prime minister from 1991 onwards in Albania. \n\nThe claim is about two things:\n1. Only one person has been a member of the Party of Labour of Albania.\n2. That person was elected.\n\nSo I need to check each entry in the \"political party\" column to see how many times the Party of Labour of Albania appears and whether those individuals were elected.\n\nLooking through the data rows:\n\n- Row 1: Fatos Nano (1st time) with political party as Party of Labour of Albania.\n- Rows 2-3: Other parties, no match.\n- Then in later rows, the parties are either Socialist or Democratic. \n\nSo, I see only one entry where the political party is \"party of labour of albania\" which is Fatos Nano's first term.\n\nNow, about being elected. The claim says they were elected, but looking at the data, there's no explicit column indicating whether each prime minister was elected or appointed. However, in most cases, prime ministers are either elected through democratic processes or appointed. Given that these are prime ministers from 1991 onwards, post-communist era, it's likely that they were elected, but without specific information, I have to make assumptions.\n\nBut the claim is about \"only 1 person\" and whether they were elected. Since there's only one person from the Party of Labour of Albania, Fatos Nano (first time), and assuming he was elected as prime minister, the claim seems TRUE.\n\nTherefore, relevant cells are the ones showing the political party for that row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because only Fatos Nano (1st time) is listed under the Party of Labour of Albania. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

That would mean Ylli's start date should be later.

I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying: \"ilir meta be the first person since aleksand\u00ebr meksi, to be elect as a member of the democratic party of albania political party.\" Hmm, I think there might be some typos here. Maybe it should say \"be elected\" instead of \"be elect\"? Also, \"to be elected as a member\" sounds a bit off. Perhaps the intended meaning is that Ilir Meta was the first person since Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi to hold a position with the Democratic Party of Albania.\n\nNow, looking at the table data, I see rows listing prime ministers from 1991 onwards. Each row has details like name, born-died dates, term start and end, and political party.\n\nI need to check two main things:\n1. Who was elected as a member (or served) in the Democratic Party of Albania after Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi.\n2. Determine if Ilir Meta was indeed the first person after Meksi in that role.\n\nFirst, let's identify Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi in the table. Scanning through the rows, I find \"aleksand\u00ebr meksi\" under the name column at row index 4. His term started on April 13, 1992, and ended on March 11, 1997. His political party is listed as the Democratic Party of Albania.\n\nNext, I need to see who came after him in that party. Looking further down, Sali Berisha (row index 10) was a member of the Democratic Party of Albania, serving from September 11, 2005, to September 15, 2013. That's way later than Meksi.\n\nIlir Meta is in row index 8. His name is \"ilir meta,\" and his political party is the Socialist Party of Albania. So he was not with the Democratic Party during his term from October 29, 1999, to February 22, 2002. \n\nWait a minute, the claim says Ilir Meta was elected as a member of the Democratic Party after Meksi. But according to the table, he's part of the Socialist Party. So that contradicts the claim.\n\nAdditionally, Sali Berisha is in the Democratic Party and served much later than Meksi. If we're looking for someone after Meksi, Berisha fits the timeline but isn't mentioned in the claim. The claim specifically mentions Ilir Meta, which doesn't align with his political party as per the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Ilir Meta wasn't part of the Democratic Party; he was a Socialist Party member. Moreover, after Meksi, the next from the Democratic Party was Berisha, not Meta.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Ilir Meta was the first person since Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi to be elected as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania. However, according to the table:\n\n- Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi served with the Democratic Party from 1992 to 1997.\n- Ilir Meta is listed under the Socialist Party and did not serve in the Democratic Party after Meksi.\n- The next leader from the Democratic Party was Sali Berisha, who started his term much later than Meksi.\n\nThus, the claim is false because Ilir Meta wasn't part of the Democratic Party post-Meksi. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are \"name,\" \"born - died,\" \"term start,\" \"term end,\" and \"political party.\" So each row represents a prime minister with their details in these categories.\n\nThe claim is about the number of people who have been members of the Socialist Party of Albania. To verify this, I need to check the \"political party\" column for each prime minister listed.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\nRow 1: Fatos Nano (1st time) - Political party is Party of Labour of Albania.\nRow 2: Ylli Bufi - Party is Socialist Party of Albania.\nRow 3: Vilson Ahmeti - Non-party.\nRow 4: Aleksandr Meksi - Democratic Party of Albania.\nRow 5: Bashkim Fino - Socialist Party of Albania.\nRow 6: Fatos Nano (2nd time) - Socialist Party of Albania.\nRow 7: Pandeli Majko (1st time) - Socialist Party of Albania.\nRow 8: Ilir Meta - Socialist Party of Albania.\nRow 9: Pandeli Majko (2nd time) - Socialist Party of Albania.\nRow 10: Fatos Nano (3rd time) - Socialist Party of Albania.\nRow 11: Sali Berisha - Democratic Party of Albania.\nRow 12: Edi Rama - Socialist Party of Albania.\n\nNow, counting the members of the Socialist Party:\n\n- Ylli Bufi\n- Bashkim Fino\n- Fatos Nano (twice)\n- Pandeli Majko (twice)\n- Ilir Meta\n- Fatos Nano again\n- Edi Rama\n\nWait, let me recount to avoid mistakes. Each entry in the \"political party\" column that says \"socialist party of albania\" counts as a member.\n\nSo, starting from row 2:\nRow 2: Yes (Ylli Bufi)\nRow 5: Yes (Bashkim Fino)\nRow 6: Yes (Fatos Nano 2nd time)\nRow 7: Yes (Pandeli Majko 1st time)\nRow 8: Yes (Ilir Meta)\nRow 9: Yes (Pandeli Majko 2nd time)\nRow 10: Yes (Fatos Nano 3rd time)\nRow 12: Yes (Edi Rama)\n\nThat's a total of 8 different instances where the political party is the Socialist Party. However, some individuals are listed multiple times because they served in different terms. For example, Fatos Nano appears three times, and Pandeli Majko twice.\n\nSo, each instance is a term under that person as PM with their respective party. The claim states \"only 1 person have be a member,\" but clearly, there are multiple people who were members of the Socialist Party during different terms. \n\nTherefore, the claim is false because more than one person has been a member; in fact, several individuals served as Prime Ministers under that party.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because multiple people served as Prime Minister for the Socialist Party of Albania.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
