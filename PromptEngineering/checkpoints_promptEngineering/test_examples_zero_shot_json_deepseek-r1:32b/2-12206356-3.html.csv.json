    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"on june 9, the record be 28 - 29 with a loss of mulholland (5 - 6) and an opponent of the yankee.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n1. Date: June 9\n2. Record: 28-29\n3. Loss pitcher: Mulholland (5-6)\n4. Opponent: Yankees\n\nI'll look through the table to find the row corresponding to June 9. Scanning the \"date\" column, I see that June 9 is in row index 7. \n\nNow, checking each condition:\n- **Date**: Confirmed as June 9.\n- **Record**: The \"record\" column shows 28 - 29 for this row. That matches.\n- **Loss pitcher**: The \"loss\" column has \"mulholland (5 - 6)\", which aligns with the claim.\n- **Opponent**: The \"opponent\" is listed as \"yankee\", which also matches.\n\nSince all parts of the claim are supported by the data in row index 7, the answer should be TRUE. I'll note the relevant cells for each condition to confirm they're correctly referenced.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately reflects the information in the table for June 9th.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
