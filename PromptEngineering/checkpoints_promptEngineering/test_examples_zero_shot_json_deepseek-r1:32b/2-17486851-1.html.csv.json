    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format. The claim is: \"paulo costa , from portugal , be the only player go to apoel fc in the winter transfer window\".\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into key points:\n1. Player's name: Paulo Costa\n2. Nationality: Portugal (nat code 'por')\n3. Transfer destination club: Apoel FC (source column)\n4. Transfer window: Winter\n\nI need to check each of these against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to see if any match Paulo Costa.\n\nRow 0: Name is poursaitides, nationality gre (Greece). Not matching.\nRow 1: Elia, cyp (Cyprus). No.\nRow 2: Cezlakow, pol (Poland). No.\nRow 3: Papathanasiou, cyp. No.\nRow 4: Christou, cyp. No.\nRow 5: Chiotis, gre. No.\nRow 6: Paulista, bra (Brazil). Close but not Paulo Costa.\nRow 7: Kyriakou, cyp. No.\nRow 8: Kosowski, pol. No.\nRow 9: Onwuachi, ngr (Nigeria). No.\nRow 10: Alexandrou, cyp. No.\nRow 11: Paulo Costa, por (Portugal). Yes.\n\nNow checking the details for row 11:\n- Name: paulo costa\n- Nat: por (Portugal)\n- Source: apoelfccomcy (which I assume is Apoel FC)\n- Transfer window: winter\n\nSo, according to this row, Paulo Costa from Portugal joined Apoel FC in the winter transfer window.\n\nNow, the claim says he's \"the only player\" who went there in that window. So I need to check if any other players also transferred to Apoel FC during winter.\n\nLooking through all rows where source is apoelfccomcy:\n- Row 8: Kosowski, summer\n- Row 10: Alexandrou, summer\n- Row 11: Paulo Costa, winter\n\nSo only row 11 has a transfer in the winter window to Apoel FC. Therefore, Paulo Costa is indeed the only player who went there during winter.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"nat\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"transfer window\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"source\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"Apoel FC gain 5 Cypriot players in the 2008 summer transfer window, the most of any nationality.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the data provided.\n\n1. **Identifying Apoel FC**: The claim mentions Apoel FC as the club gaining players. Looking at the 'source' column in the table, entries with \"apoelfccomcy\" likely indicate transactions involving Apoel FC. So, I'll look for rows where 'source' is \"apoelfccomcy\".\n\n2. **Cypriot Players**: The claim refers to Cypriot players. In the 'nat' column, 'cyp' stands for Cyprus. So, any player with 'nat' as 'cyp' is a Cypriot.\n\n3. **Transfer Window and Year**: The transfer window in question is summer 2008. I'll check the 'transfer window' and 'ends' columns to see if these transactions occurred around that time. However, looking at the data, the 'ends' column shows years like 2009, 2010, etc., which might indicate contract end years rather than transfer dates. Since the 'transfer window' is listed as \"summer\" without a year, I'll assume it refers to summer 2008 based on the claim.\n\n4. **Count of Players**: The claim says Apoel FC gained 5 Cypriot players. I need to count how many rows meet all these criteria: 'source' is \"apoelfccomcy\", 'nat' is 'cyp', and 'transfer window' is summer.\n\nNow, let's go through each row in the data:\n\n- **Row 0**: source is \"24sportscomcy\" \u2192 Not Apoel FC.\n- **Row 1**: source is \"-\" \u2192 Not relevant.\n- **Row 2**: source is \"kerkidanet\" \u2192 Not Apoel FC.\n- **Row 3**: source is \"-\" \u2192 Not relevant.\n- **Row 4**: source is \"sigmalivecom\" \u2192 Not Apoel FC.\n- **Row 5**: source is \"kerkidanet\" \u2192 Not Apoel FC.\n- **Row 6**: source is \"kerkidanet\" \u2192 Not Apoel FC.\n- **Row 7**: source is \"-\" \u2192 Not relevant.\n- **Row 8**: source is \"apoelfccomcy\" and 'nat' is 'pol' (Polish) \u2192 Doesn't count as Cypriot.\n- **Row 9**: source is \"apoelfccomcy\", 'nat' is 'ngr' (Nigerian), transfer window is summer, but the year under 'ends' is 2009. However, since the claim doesn't specify a year in the table data except for 2010s, it's unclear if this is 2008.\n- **Row 10**: source is \"apoelfccomcy\", 'nat' is 'cyp', transfer window summer \u2192 This counts as one Cypriot player.\n- **Row 11**: source is \"apoelfccomcy\", but 'transfer window' is winter \u2192 Doesn't fit the claim.\n\nWait, so looking again, only Row 10 has 'source' as Apoel FC and 'nat' as Cypriot with a summer transfer window. That's just one player, not five. There are other Cypriot players in Rows 1,3,5,7,9, but their sources aren't Apoel FC or their nationalities don't match.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Apoel FC gained 5 Cypriot players in summer 2008 isn't supported by the data. The relevant cells are only Row 10 for Apoel and Cypriot, but there's only one such player.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"source\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"nat\"},\n     {\"row_10\", \"column_name\": \"source\"},\n     {\"row_10\", \"column_name\": \"nat\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the claim \"only 2 player, christou and onwuachi, have any transfer fee from their previous club\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that only two players\u2014christou and onwuachi\u2014have incurred a transfer fee when moving from their previous clubs. So, my goal is to check the 'transfer fee' column for all entries to see if only these two have non-zero fees.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a player with several attributes including \"name\", \"transfer fee\", and others. The relevant columns here are \"name\" and \"transfer fee\". \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Name is 'poursaitides', transfer fee is 'free'. So, no fee.\n2. **Row 1**: Name is 'elia', transfer fee is '-'. This likely means there's no fee, so no charge.\n3. **Row 2**: Name is '\\u017cew\\u0142akow', transfer fee is 'free'. No fee here either.\n4. **Row 3**: Name is 'papathanasiou', transfer fee is 'free'. Again, no fee.\n5. **Row 4**: Name is 'christou', transfer fee is '120k'. This counts as a transfer fee.\n6. **Row 5**: Name is 'chiotis', transfer fee is 'free'. No fee.\n7. **Row 6**: Name is 'paulista', transfer fee is 'free'. No fee.\n8. **Row 7**: Name is 'kyriakou', transfer fee is '-'. No fee.\n9. **Row 8**: Name is 'kosowski', transfer fee is 'free'. No fee.\n10. **Row 9**: Name is 'onwuachi', transfer fee is '200k'. This is another fee.\n11. **Row 10**: Name is 'alexandrou', transfer fee is 'free'. No fee.\n12. **Row 11**: Name is 'paulo costa', transfer fee is 'free'. No fee.\n\nFrom this analysis, only christou (row 4) and onwuachi (row 9) have transfer fees of '120k' and '200k' respectively. All other players either have a 'free' transfer or no data indicated by '-'.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct as it accurately identifies that only these two players had transfer fees from their previous clubs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about christou's transfer is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the claim and then checking each part against the data.\n\nThe claim says: \"christou's transfer from aek larnaca be the longest deal of any in this season, run until 2012.\" So, two main points here:\n\n1. Christou transferred from AEK Larnaca.\n2. His transfer is the longest deal (i.e., runs until 2012).\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find the row that mentions christou. Scanning the 'name' column, I see in row index 4: \"christou\" with moving from \"aek larnaca\". So that checks out for point 1.\n\nNow, checking when his transfer ends. The 'ends' column for this row is 2012. That's later than most other entries which end in 2010 or 2009. So his deal does run until 2012, making it longer compared to others.\n\nLooking at all the rows:\n\n- Rows with 'ends' as 2012: Only christou (row 4) has that.\n- Other transfers end in 2010 or earlier.\n\nSo, yes, christou's transfer is the longest deal in this table, ending in 2012. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nRelevant cells are:\n\n- Row 4, 'name' to confirm it's christou.\n- Row 4, 'moving from' to check AEK Larnaca.\n- Row 4, 'ends' to see the duration (2012).\n\nSo all parts of the claim are supported by these cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE.

Let's break down the claim: \"apoel fc gain 2 players from anorthosis famagusta: poursaitides by transfer and paulo costa on loan.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for any entries where the club moving from is \"anorthosis famagusta.\" Scanning through the data:\n\n- Row 0: Moving from is \"anorthosis famagusta,\" player name is \"poursaitides,\" type is \"transfer,\" and source is \"24sportscomcy.\"\n- Row 11: Moving from is also \"anorthosis famagusta,\" player name is \"paulo costa,\" type is \"loan.\"\n\nSo, both players are moving out of \"anorthosis famagusta.\" Now, I need to check if these transfers are to \"apoel fc.\" The claim mentions that they were gained by apoel, so I should look for the destination club in each transfer. However, the table only provides information about where the players are moving from and their sources but doesn't explicitly state the destination. \n\nThe source columns might indicate the receiving club. For row 0, the source is \"24sportscomcy,\" which seems like a news site and not necessarily the destination club. Row 11 has the source as \"apoelfccomcy,\" which likely stands for apoel fc's website or official source. This suggests that Paulo Costa was loaned to apoel fc.\n\nPoursaitides' transfer is listed under a different source, so I can't be certain if he moved directly to apoel fc based on this table alone. Since the claim states that both players were gained by apoel, but only Paulo Costa's transfer explicitly points to them, while Poursaitides doesn't have a clear destination linked to apoel, the claim isn't fully supported.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"moving from\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"source\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"moving from\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"source\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"elia, from portugal, be the only player go to apoel fc in the winter transfer window.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into parts:\n\n1. **Player Name**: elia\n2. **Nationality**: portugal (nat column)\n3. **Transfer Window**: winter\n4. **Destination Club**: apoel fc\n\nI'll need to check each of these points against the table data.\n\nLooking at the \"data\" array, I see 12 rows. Let me go through each row to find any entries related to elia or any players going to apoel fc in the winter window.\n\nStarting with Row 0:\n- Name: poursaitides\n- Nat: gre (Greece)\nNot elia and not from Portugal. Transfer window is summer, so irrelevant.\n\nRow 1:\n- Name: elia\n- Nat: cyp (Cyprus)\nAh, here's elia. But his nationality is Cypriot, not Portuguese. The transfer type is \"loan return\" in the summer window. So this doesn't fit the claim because he's from Cyprus and the transfer was a loan return, not to apoel fc.\n\nRow 2:\n- Name:zewlakow\n- Nat: pol (Poland)\nNo match for elia or the other criteria.\n\nRow 3:\n- Name: papathanasiou\n- Nat: cyp\nTransfer in summer. Not relevant.\n\nRow 4:\n- Name: christou\n- Nat: cyp\nSummer transfer to aek larnaca, not apoel.\n\nRow 5:\n- Name: chiottis\n- Nat: gre\nSummer transfer.

Doesn't match winter or apoel.\n\nRow 10:\n- Name: alexandrou\n- Nat: cyp\nTransfer in summer to apoel? Wait, the \"source\" here is apoelfccomcy, which I think stands for Apoel FC. So this player is going to Apoel FC in summer 2011.\n\nRow 11:\n- Name: paulo costa\n- Nat: por (Portugal)\nTransfer window: winter\nSource: apoelfccomcy (Apoel FC)\nSo he's from Portugal, moving to Apoel FC in the winter window. That fits part of the claim but not for elia.\n\nNow, looking back at the claim: \"elia from portugal...\". But in the table, elia is Cypriot, so that part is false. Also, there's another player (paulo costa) who moved to Apoel FC in winter, so elia isn't the only one if he had done so.\n\nWait, but in row 11, paulo Costa is moving to apoel in winter. So even if elia were from Portugal and had moved to apoel in winter, the claim says he's the only one, but paulo costa also did a winter transfer to apoel. Therefore, regardless of elia's details, the claim would be false because there's another player.\n\nBut wait, in row 11, it's paulo costa from Portugal moving to Apoel in winter. So that's one player, and if elia had moved in winter as well, but he didn't\u2014elia is Cypriot and moved in summer via loan return. Therefore, the only player moving to apoel in winter is paulo costa.\n\nSo the claim says \"elia from portugal... only player go to apoel fc in winter.\" But elia isn't from Portugal; he's Cypriot. Additionally, there's another player (paulo Costa) who did move to Apoel in winter. Therefore, the claim is false because:\n\n1. Elia is not Portuguese.\n2. There is at least one other player (paulo Costa) moving to Apoel in winter.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are those that show paulo Costa's transfer and elia's details which don't fit the claim.\n\nRelevant Cells:\n- For paulo Costa: row 11, columns \"name\", \"nat\", \"source\", \"transfer window\"\n- For elia: row 1, columns \"name\", \"nat\", \"transfer window\"\n\nThese cells show that elia isn't from Portugal and that another player moved to Apoel in winter.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE.

It mentions christou transferring from Aek Larnaca, and that his deal is the longest, lasting until 2010.\n\nLooking at the table, let's find the row for christou. Scanning through the data rows:\n\nRow 4 has \"cyp\" under nat, \"christou\" as name, moving from aek larnaca, type transfer, summer window, ends in 2012, transfer fee is 120k, and source sigmalivecom.\n\nSo, christou's transfer ends in 2012. The claim says the deal runs until 2010, which doesn't match because 2012 is later than 2010. That already seems like a discrepancy.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again: yes, the \"ends\" column for christou is 2012. So according to the table, his deal runs until 2012, not 2010 as the claim states.\n\nAdditionally, the claim says this is the longest deal of any in the season.

Or when their contract ends?\n\nThe claim says \"2008 summer transfer window.\" The table doesn't have entries for 2008; all are 2009, 2010, etc. So perhaps there's a mistake in the claim.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the 'ends' column. It could mean the year they were signed or when their contract ends. The claim is about signings in summer 2008, so if a player was signed in summer 2008, the 'transfer window' would be summer and perhaps the 'ends' year would be around that time.\n\nLooking at rows where \"source\" is \"apoelfccomcy\":\n- Row 8: ends 2010\n- Row 9: ends 2009, nationality ngr (Nigeria)\n- Row 10: ends 2011, cyp\n- Row 11: ends 2009, por\n\nWait, maybe the 'transfer window' refers to when they were transferred. So if a player was signed in summer, regardless of the year.\n\nBut the claim is about 2008 specifically. The table doesn't have any entries with 'summer' and year 2008. All summer transfers are in years after that.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is false because there's no data for 2008 summer window in the provided table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all rows:\n\nRow indices:\n- 0: gre, anorthosis famagusta, transfer, summer, ends 2010\n- 1: cyp, loan return, summer, ends 2009\n- 2: pol, transfer, summer, ends 2010\n- 3: cyp, transfer, summer, ends 2010\n- 4: cyp, aek larnaca?, transfer, summer, ends 2012\n- 5: gre, porto, transfer, summer, ends 2010\n- 6: pol, transfer, summer, ends 2010\n- 7: cyp, loan return, summer, ends 2009\n- 8: cyp, transfer, summer, ends 2010 (source apoelfccomcy)\n- 9: ngr, transfer, winter, ends 2009 (source apoelfccomcy)\n- 10: cyp, transfer, summer, ends 2011 (source apoelfccomcy)\n- 11: por, transfer, winter, ends 2009 (source apoelfccomcy)\n\nWait, maybe the 'transfer window' refers to when they were transferred, but without years. So for example, a summer transfer could be any year, but we don't have info on the exact year.\n\nBut the claim specifically says \"2008 summer.\" Since none of the entries in the table mention 2008, and all the 'ends' columns are from 2009 onwards, it's possible that the data doesn't include any players transferred in 2008. Therefore, apoel fc couldn't have gained 4 Cypriot players in the 2008 summer window as per this table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to infer the transfer year based on the 'ends' column. For example, if a player's contract ends in 2010 and was signed in summer, perhaps they were signed in summer 2008? But that's speculative without more data.\n\nBut given the information, there are no entries with the transfer window as summer in 2008. Therefore, the claim is likely false because the table doesn't support it.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that apoel fc gained four Cypriot players during the 2008 summer transfer window, which would be the most of any nationality according to the data provided. However, upon reviewing the table:\n\n- The \"transfer window\" entries are either 'summer' or 'winter', but there's no specific year mentioned.\n- All rows with a 'summer' transfer window have 'ends' years ranging from 2009 onwards, not 2008.\n- There are multiple Cypriot players (nationality 'CYP') in the table, but they were transferred in later years.\n\nSince there's no data supporting transfers in the 2008 summer window for apoel fc, the claim cannot be verified with the given information. Therefore, it is likely false.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"is_claim\": false,\n    \"reasons\": [\n        {\n            \"description\": \"The table does not contain any entries specifically related to the 2008 summer transfer window.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"description\": \"All 'transfer window' entries in the table are either for years after 2008 or do not specify a year.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"only 2 players, christou and paulo costa, have any transfer fee from their previous club.\" \n\nFirst, I'll parse the table's columns and data. The relevant columns for this claim are \"name\" and \"transfer fee.\" Each row in the data represents a player with details about their transfer.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Name is \"poursaitides,\" transfer fee is \"free.\" So, no transfer fee here.\n2. **Row 1**: Name is \"elia,\" transfer fee is \"-\", which I assume means no fee.\n3. **Row 2**: Name is \"\\u017cew\\u0142akow,\" transfer fee is \"free.\" No fee.\n4. **Row 3**: Name is \"papathanasiou,\" transfer fee is \"free.\" Again, no fee.\n5. **Row 4**: Name is \"christou,\" transfer fee is \"120k.\" This is a transfer fee, so this player counts.\n6. **Row 5**: Name is \"chiotis,\" transfer fee is \"free.\"\n7. **Row 6**: Name is \"paulista,\" transfer fee is \"free.\"\n8. **Row 7**: Name is \"kyriakou,\" transfer fee is \"-.\" No fee.\n9. **Row 8**: Name is \"kosowski,\" transfer fee is \"free.\"\n10. **Row 9**: Name is \"onwuachi,\" transfer fee is \"200k.\" Wait, that's another player with a transfer fee.\n11. **Row 10**: Name is \"alexandrou,\" transfer fee is \"free.\"\n12. **Row 11**: Name is \"paulo costa,\" transfer fee is \"free.\"\n\nWait, the claim says only christou and paulo costa have transfer fees, but looking at row 9, onwuachi has a transfer fee of 200k. So that's actually three players with transfer fees: christou (120k), onwuachi (200k), and paulo costa? Wait no, paulo costa's transfer fee is \"free.\" Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the claim. The claim says \"only 2 players... have any transfer fee.\" But according to my analysis, there are two players with a transfer fee: christou (120k) and onwuachi (200k). Paulo Costa's transfer fee is \"free,\" so he doesn't count.\n\nWait, that contradicts the claim. The claim mentions paulo costa as having a transfer fee, but according to row 11, his transfer fee is \"free.\" So the claim incorrectly includes him, making the statement false because there are only two players (christou and onwuachi) with fees, not including paulo costa.\n\nWait no, let me double-check. Row 9: onwuachi has a transfer fee of 200k. So that's another one. But the claim says only christou and paulo costa have any transfer fee. However, in reality, onwuachi also has a transfer fee. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because there are three players with fees (if we count all), but actually, looking again:\n\nWait row 4: christou - 120k\n\nRow 9: onwuachi - 200k\n\nRow 11: paulo costa - free.\n\nSo only two players have transfer fees: christou and onwuachi. But the claim mentions christou and paulo costa, which is incorrect because paulo Costa's fee is free. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but in row 9, onwuachi has a fee of 200k. So that would make it three players with fees: christou (120k), onwuachi (200k). Wait no, only two because paulo Costa's fee is free. The claim says \"only 2 player, christou and paulo costa,\" but in reality, only christou has a fee, and onwuachi also has a fee, making it two players with fees, not including paulo Costa.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me list all the transfer fees:\n\n- Row 0: free\n- Row 1: -\n- Row 2: free\n- Row 3: free\n- Row 4: 120k (christou)\n- Row 5: free\n- Row 6: free\n- Row 7: -\n- Row 8: free\n- Row 9: 200k (onwuachi)\n- Row 10: free\n- Row 11: free\n\nSo, only two players have transfer fees: christou and onwuachi. The claim mentions christou and paulo costa, but paulo Costa doesn't have a fee. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it excludes onwuachi and includes paulo Costa incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering row 9. Let me check again. Row 9: name \"onwuachi,\" transfer fee \"200k.\" So yes, he has a fee. Thus, the correct count is two players with fees: christou (120k) and onwuachi (200k). The claim incorrectly lists paulo Costa instead of onwuachi.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because it does not correctly identify the two players with transfer fees. It should be christou and onwuachi, not paulo Costa.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because only two players have a transfer fee (christou and onwuachi), but the claim incorrectly mentions paulo costa instead of onwuachi.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": \"false\"\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"apoel fc gain 2 player from anorthosis famagusta : poursaitides and paulo costa on loan\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim:\n\n1. **Players Involved**: The claim mentions two players: \"poursaitides\" and \"paulo costa\".\n2. **Club Gained**: The club gaining these players is \"Apoel FC\".\n3. **Transfer Type**: Both are mentioned to be on loan.\n4. **Transferring Club**: Both players are moving from \"Anorthosis Famagusta\".\n\nNow, I'll check the table for each of these details.\n\n**Checking for Poursaitides:**\n- Looking through the data rows, row 0 has the name \"poursaitides\".\n- His transfer type is listed as \"transfer\", not \"loan\". \n- The source is \"24sportscomcy\", which doesn't mention Apoel FC. So this seems inconsistent with the claim that he was loaned to Apoel.\n\n**Checking for Paulo Costa:**\n- Looking through the data, row 10 has the name \"paulo costa\".\n- His transfer type is listed as \"loan\".\n- The source is \"apoelfccomcy\", which suggests he's associated with Apoel FC.\n- However, his transfer window is \"winter\" instead of \"summer\" as mentioned in other transfers from Anorthosis Famagusta.\n\n**Transfer Window Consistency:**\n- Most players moving from Anorthosis Famagusta have a summer transfer window. Paulo Costa's winter window might be an inconsistency depending on the context, but it doesn't necessarily invalidate the loan transfer to Apoel FC.\n\n**Apoel FC Gaining Players:**\n- The claim states that Apoel FC gained these two players. Looking at the \"source\" column:\n  - Poursaitides' source is not from Apoel.\n  - Paulo Costa's source is from Apoel, which aligns with him being a loaned player.\n\n**Transfer Type Mismatch:**\n- The main issue is that poursaitides was transferred, not on loan. Since the claim specifies both were on loan, this mismatch makes part of the claim incorrect.\n\nConsidering all these points:\n- Paulo Costa's details support the claim (loan from Anorthosis Famagusta to Apoel).\n- Poursaitides' transfer type doesn't match (he was transferred, not loaned), and his source isn't Apoel.\n\nTherefore, since both players aren't correctly on loan to Apoel as claimed, the overall statement is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Apoel FC gained two players from Anorthosis Famagusta: Poursaitides and Paulo Costa, both on loan. Checking the table:\n\n- **Poursaitides** (row 0): Transfer type is \"transfer\", not \"loan\". Source isn't Apoel.\n- **Paulo Costa** (row 10): Transfer type is \"loan\" from Anorthosis Famagusta to Apoel.\n\nSince only Paulo Costa's details match the claim, the statement about both being loaned is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"transfer window\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
