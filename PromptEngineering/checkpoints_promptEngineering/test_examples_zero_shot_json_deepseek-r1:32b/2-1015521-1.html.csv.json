Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim refers to.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"t - 260 eu\" which seems like a specific version of an aircraft. I'll look through the \"versions\" column in the table to find any entry that matches this. Scanning through the data, I see that row index 13 has the version \"t - 260 eu\". So that's a match.\n\nNext, the claim states there are currently 12 of these aircraft in service. The relevant column for this is \"in service\". Looking at row 13 under the \"in service\" column, it says \"12\". This directly supports the number mentioned in the claim.\n\nI should also make sure that no other rows have the same version or a similar count that could cause confusion. Checking all other rows quickly, none of them mention \"t - 260 eu\", so there's no conflicting information.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim\u2014the specific version and the number in service\u2014are accurately reflected in the table.

There are exactly 3 units currently in service.\n\nLooking at the columns in the table: \"aircraft\", \"origin\", \"type\", \"versions\", \"in service\".\n\nI'll go through each row to find any entry that matches the aircraft model C-95 and is from Brazil.\n\nStarting with the first few rows, I see:\n- Row 0: Cessna A-37 Dragonfly (US origin)\n- Row 1: FMA IA 58 Pucar\u00e3 (Argentina)\n- Row 2: Lockheed C-130 Hercules (US)\n- Row 3: Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante, origin Brazil.

The claim states: \"bell uh-1 iroquois be the version of b-58 aircraft model originate in the united state which have 2 in service.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim to understand what it's asserting. It seems there are a few parts here:\n\n1. The \"bell uh-1 iroquois\" is identified as a version of the b-58 aircraft model.\n2. This aircraft originates from the United States.\n3. There are 2 units in service.\n\nNow, I'll check each part against the table to see if they align.\n\nLooking at the table data:\n\nEach row represents an aircraft with details including its name, origin, type, versions, and number in service.\n\nI need to find rows where the version is \"b-58\" or related. Scanning through the versions column, I notice that one of the entries has \"b-58\". Let me check which row that is.\n\nLooking at row 8: The aircraft is \"beechcraft b58 baron\", origin is United States, type is trainer/liaison, version is \"b-58\", and in service count is 2. So this seems to be the b-58 model from the U.S. with 2 in service.\n\nNow, regarding the claim that \"bell uh-1 iroquois\" is a version of the b-58. Wait, looking at row 14: The aircraft is \"bell uh-1 iroquois\", origin is United States, type transport/utility, version is \"uh-1h\", and in service count is 13.\n\nSo, the bell uh-1 iroquois has a different version (uh-1h) than the b-58. They are separate entries with their own versions. Therefore, the claim that the bell uh-1 iroquois is the version of the b-58 is incorrect. The b-58 is in row 8 with 2 in service, while the uh-1h is a different aircraft with 13 in service.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"bell uh-1 iroquois be the version of b-58\". That would mean that the version of the b-58 is uh-1. But according to the table, the b-58's version is just \"b-58\", not related to uh-1h. So the claim is mixing up two different aircraft models.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because:\n\n- The bell uh-1 iroquois is a separate model from the beechcraft b58 baron.\n- The versions are different: uh-1h vs b-58.\n- The in service count for b-58 is 2, but that's not tied to the uh-1 iroquois.\n\nSo, all parts of the claim don't align with the table data. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE, and I'll note the relevant rows: row 8 (b-58) and row 14 (uh-1h).\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"versions\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"origin\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"in service\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"aircraft\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"versions\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"origin\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"in service\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So, I'll look for entries with \"embraer emb 120 brasilia.\"\n\nLooking through the data array, each row represents an aircraft.

The relevant columns for this claim are \"origin\" and \"type\".\n\nThe claim states that Brazil has both transport/utility and attack type aircraft. So, I need to check if there are any rows where the origin is Brazil and the type includes either transport/utility or attack.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Origin is United States.

The version here is T-260 EU, and the origin is Italy. Wait, but the claim says Switzerland as the origin.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a row with Switzerland as the origin. Let me check again.\n\nAh, the twelfth row is Pilatus PC-7 Turbo Trainer, which does originate from Switzerland. The version here is \"-92\", so not T-260 EU. Also, in service count is \"5 (6 delivered)\", which doesn't match 12.\n\nThe thirteenth row is Cessna T-41 Mescalero, USA.\nFourteenth: Aerospatiale Dauphin, France.\nFifteenth: Bell 212 Twin Huey, USA.\nSixteenth: Bell UH-1 Iroquois, USA.\n\nSo, looking through all rows, the only one with version related to T-260 is row 11 (Aermacchi SF260), which has \"t - 260 eu\" as the type. But its origin is Italy, not Switzerland. The number in service is 12, which matches the claim's count.\n\nWait a second, maybe I made a mistake.

So that doesn't match the claim's version or origin.\n\nTherefore, there's no aircraft in the table that originates from Switzerland with version T-260 EU. The only one with T-260 EU is from Italy, but not Switzerland.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the row indices.

In the table, Aermacchi SF260 in row 10 has version T-260 EU and in service 12, but origin is Italy.\n\nPilatus PC-7 in row 11 is Switzerland, but version is -92, not T-260 EU.\n\nSo the claim states that these aircraft are from Switzerland, but according to the table, the only ones with t-260 eu are from Italy. Therefore, the claim doesn't hold because the origin doesn't match.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies 12 T-260 EU aircraft originating from Switzerland. The table shows Aermacchi SF260 (row 10) has 12 in service with version T-260 EU but is from Italy, not Switzerland. Pilatus PC-7 (row 11) is from Switzerland but doesn't match the version or count.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"the aircraft bell 212 twin huey be a trainer type.\" So I need to check if this specific aircraft is listed as a trainer in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the data provided. Each row has columns: aircraft, origin, type, versions, and in service. The key information here for the claim is the \"aircraft\" name and its corresponding \"type.\"\n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n\n1. Cessna A-37 Dragonfly - Type: Attack / Fighter\n2. FMA IA 58 Pucar\u00e3 - Type: Attack\n3. Lockheed C-130 Hercules - Type: Transport / Utility\n\nContinuing down, I see a row that mentions \"Bell 212 Twin Huey.\" Let me check the details of this row.\n\nRow index 14 (if starting from 0, it's actually row 15 in some contexts, but let's confirm):\n\nThe data array is zero-indexed. So let me count:\n\n- Row 0: Cessna A-37\n- Row 1: FMA IA 58\n- Row 2: Lockheed C-130\n- Row 3: Embraer Bandeirante\n- Row 4: Beechcraft Twin Bonanza\n- Row 5: CASA C-212\n- Row 6: Embraer Brasilia\n- Row 7: Cessna 206 Stationair\n- Row 8: Beechcraft Baron\n- Row 9: British Aerospace 125\n- Row 10: Aermacchi SF260\n- Row 11: Pilatus Turbo Trainer\n- Row 12: Cessna T-41 Mescalero\n- Row 13: Aerospatiale Dauphin\n- Row 14: Bell 212 Twin Huey\n- Row 15: Bell UH-1 Iroquois\n\nSo, row index 14 is for Bell 212 Twin Huey. The \"type\" column in this row is listed as \"transport / utility.\" \n\nThe claim states that it's a trainer type. But according to the table, it's under transport/utility, not trainer. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows mentioning Bell 212 Twin Huey, but looking through all the data, only row 14 has this aircraft name. So I'm confident that this is the correct entry to reference.\n\nThus, the relevant cells would be row 14's \"aircraft\" and \"type.\" Therefore, the answer should be FALSE because the type isn't a trainer.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Bell 212 Twin Huey is a trainer type. Checking the table, this aircraft is categorized under \"transport / utility,\" not as a trainer. Hence, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"aircraft\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
