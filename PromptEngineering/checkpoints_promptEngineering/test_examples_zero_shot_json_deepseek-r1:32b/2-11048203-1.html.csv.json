    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"hatem aqel have more win than loss\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what's given.\n\nThe table has columns: date, venue, score, result, competition. Each row represents a match with specific details. The claim mentions Hatem Aqel, but looking at the data, there's no information about who scored or individual players' performances\u2014just the team results.\n\nI see that each row lists the result as \"win,\" \"draw,\" or \"loss.\" Since the table doesn't mention any player names, including Hatem Aqel, I can't determine his personal performance. The claim is about his number of wins compared to losses, but without data on his specific games or contributions, it's impossible to verify.\n\nTherefore, based solely on this table, we don't have enough information to assess Hatem Aqel's win-loss record.\n</think>\n\nThe table lacks any mention of Hatem Aqel, making the claim unverifiable. Thus, the answer is FALSE with no relevant cells as there's no data supporting or refuting the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the table structure, it has columns: date, venue, score, result, and competition. The data consists of 9 rows. Each row represents a match with details like when and where it was played, the score, whether it was a win, draw, or loss, and the competition it was part of.\n\nThe claim mentions Hatem Aqel, but I notice that none of the table entries include information about players involved in the matches. The table only provides details about the matches themselves, not about individual players like Hatem Aqel. Therefore, without any data about who participated in each match, we can't determine anything specific to Hatem Aqel's performance.\n\nSince the relevant cells needed to assess the claim are entirely missing from the table, it's impossible to verify whether the number of draws equals the number of losses for him. Without this information, the claim cannot be supported by the given data.\n\nThus, based on the available information, we must conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the latest of all the competition be on october 28 2013\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that October 28, 2013, was the latest date of all competitions listed in the table. So I need to check which row has this date and see if there are any other dates after it.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"date\" column. The dates go from December 16, 2002, up to October 28, 2013. Let me list out all the dates:\n\n- 16 december 2002\n- 17 october 2003\n- 18 february 2004\n- 18 august 2004\n- 14 february 2006\n- 22 february 2006\n- 28 january 2009\n- 9 september 2009\n- 28 october 2013\n\nNow, I need to find the latest date among these. October 28, 2013, seems to be the most recent because it's in 2013, and none of the other dates are after that year.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there aren't any later dates beyond that. The last row is indeed October 28, 2013, so there are no rows after that date. Therefore, this must be the latest competition date in the table.\n\nSo the claim states that the latest competition was on October 28, 2013. Since that's correct based on the data provided, the answer should be TRUE. The relevant cell is in the last row (row index 8) under the \"date\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly identifies the latest date in the table as October 28, 2013.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the competition after the 1 on february 18 , 2004 be a friendly competition.\" Hmm, this seems a bit unclear. I think it's asking about what happened in the competition that occurred right after February 18, 2004. Wait, but looking at the table, there are two entries with February dates: one on 18 February 2004 and another on 14 February 2006. So I need to figure out which one is being referred to.\n\nWait, the claim says \"after the 1 on february 18 , 2004.\" That might be a bit confusing. Maybe it's saying that after the match on February 18, 2004, what was the next competition? Or perhaps it's referring to something else.\n\nLooking at the table, let's find the row with date \"18 february 2004.\" That's row index 2. The columns are date, venue, score, result, and competition. For this row, the competition is \"2006 fifa world cup qualification.\" So on February 18, 2004, they played a match in the World Cup qualification.\n\nNow, what's the next competition after that? Let's check the subsequent rows. The next date after February 18, 2004 is August 18, 2004 (row index 3), which was a friendly competition. Then there's another friendly on February 14, 2006 (row index 4). But wait, the claim says \"the competition after the 1 on february 18 , 2004 be a friendly.\" So it's asking if the next competition after February 18 was a friendly. \n\nLooking at row 3: date is August 18, 2004, competition is \"friendly.\" That seems to fit. So yes, the next competition after February 18, 2004 was indeed a friendly.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that there are no other competitions between February 18 and August 18, 2004. Let me check if any other rows fall in between those dates. The next row after index 2 is index 3 on August 18, 2004. So yes, it's the immediate next competition.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are: for February 18, 2004 (row index 2) and the next competition, which is row index 3.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to the competition following February 18, 2004. From the table, the match on that date was a World Cup qualification, and the next competition listed after that date was a friendly.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 1 less friendly competition than other type of competition\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It suggests that the number of friendly competitions is one less than the sum of all other types of competitions combined.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant column for this claim is \"competition\". I'll go through each row and count how many times each competition type appears.\n\nRow 0: \"2002 arab nations cup\" \u2013 not friendly.\nRow 1: \"2004 afc asian cup qualification\" \u2013 not friendly.\nRow 2: \"2006 fifa world cup qualification\" \u2013 not friendly.\nRow 3: \"friendly\" \u2013 this is a friendly competition. Count = 1.\nRow 4: \"friendly\" \u2013 another friendly, count = 2.\nRow 5: \"2007 afc asian cup qualification\" \u2013 not friendly.\nRow 6: \"2011 afc asian cup qualification\" \u2013 not friendly.\nRow 7: \"friendly\" \u2013 third friendly, count = 3.\nRow 8: \"friendly\" \u2013 fourth friendly, count = 4.\n\nSo there are 4 friendly competitions in total.\n\nNow, let's count the other types. From rows 0 to 5 and row 6:\n\nRows 0: 1\nRow 1: 1\nRow 2: 1\nRow 3: already counted as friendly.\nRow 4: same.\nRow 5: 1\nRow 6: 1\n\nWait, actually, rows 0-8 have the following competitions:\n\nFriendly appears in rows 3,4,7,8 \u2192 total of 4.\n\nThe other competitions are in rows 0,1,2,5,6. Let's count them:\n\nRow 0: \"2002 arab nations cup\" \u2013 1\nRow 1: \"2004 afc asian cup qualification\" \u2013 2\nRow 2: \"2006 fifa world cup qualification\" \u20133\nRow 5: \"2007 afc asian cup qualification\" \u20134\nRow 6: \"2011 afc asian cup qualification\" \u20135\n\nSo other competitions are 5 in total.\n\nThe claim states that friendly competitions should be 1 less than others. So, 4 (friendly) vs 5 (others). That means 5 - 4 = 1, which is exactly what the claim says: there is 1 less friendly competition than other types.\n\nWait a minute, but wait: in row 3 and 4, it's \"friendly\", same with rows 7 and 8. So that makes 4 friendlies. The others are 5. Therefore, 5 -4=1. So yes, there is one less friendly competition than the other types.\n\nWait, no, actually, the claim says \"there be 1 less friendly competition than other type of competition\". So if 'other' is 5 and 'friendly' is 4, then 4 =5-1, which fits. Therefore, it's TRUE.\n\nBut wait, let me recount to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFriendly competitions: rows 3,4,7,8 \u2192 4.\n\nOther competitions: the remaining rows are 0,1,2,5,6 \u2192 that's 5.\n\nSo yes, 4 =5-1.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"Hatem Aqel have 1 more win than he have loss\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It states that Hatem Aqel has one additional win compared to his losses. To verify this, I'll look for entries in the table where Hatem Aqel is involved and count his wins and losses.\n\nLooking at the columns in the JSON: date, venue, score, result, competition. The relevant column here is \"result\" which can be either 'win', 'loss', or 'draw'. Each row represents a match, so I need to check each row's result to tally up the wins and losses.\n\nNow, I'll go through each data row:\n\n1. Row 0: Result is 'draw' \u2192 Not relevant.\n2. Row 1: Result is 'win' \u2192 Win count increases by 1.\n3. Row 2: Result is 'win' \u2192 Another win, total now 2.\n4. Row 3: Result is 'draw' \u2192 Not relevant.\n5. Row 4: Result is 'win' \u2192 Total wins become 3.\n6. Row 5: Result is 'win' \u2192 Wins reach 4.\n7. Row 6: Result is 'loss' \u2192 First loss, total losses =1.\n8. Row 7: Result is 'loss' \u2192 Losses increase to 2.\n9. Row 8: Result is 'win' \u2192 Wins go up to 5.\n\nSo, according to the table, Hatem Aqel has 5 wins and 2 losses. The claim says he has 1 more win than loss. Let's check: 5 wins vs. 2 losses. That means he has 3 more wins than losses (5-2=3), not just 1. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\nWins: Rows 1,2,4,5,8 \u2192 that's 5 wins.\nLosses: Rows 6 and 7 \u2192 2 losses.\nSo, 5 wins vs. 2 losses. The difference is 3, not 1.\n\nTherefore, the claim that he has 1 more win than loss is FALSE because the actual difference is 3 more wins than losses.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells, I need to list all rows where result is either 'win' or 'loss' since those directly affect the tally. So rows with index 1 (result=win), 2(win),4(win),5(win),6(loss),7(loss),8(win). Each of these contributes to the count.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are for each row where result is win or loss: rows 1-8 as mentioned.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Hatem Aqel has one more win than losses. According to the table, he has 5 wins and 2 losses, which means he actually has three more wins than losses. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n{  \n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\":1,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\":2,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\":4,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\":5,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\":6,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\":7,\"column_name\":\"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\":8,\"column_name\":\"result\"}\n   ]\n}",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table contains. It's a JSON object with columns: date, venue, score, result, competition. The data has nine rows of match information. Each row represents a game that Hatem Aqel played in, presumably as part of a team.\n\nThe claim is about the number of draws and losses in his career. So I need to count how many times the result was \"draw\" and how many times it was \"loss.\"\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Result is \"draw\". So that's one draw.\n2. **Row 1**: Result is \"win\".\n3. **Row 2**: Result is \"win\".\n4. **Row 3**: Result is \"draw\". That's the second draw.\n5. **Row 4**: Result is \"win\".\n6. **Row 5**: Result is \"win\".\n7. **Row 6**: Result is \"loss\". First loss.\n8. **Row 7**: Result is \"loss\".

But according to the table, it's only 2 of each. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data provided. It should be FALSE.\n\nWait, let me double-check in case I missed any rows:\n\nLooking again:\n- Draws: Row 0 (16 Dec 2002), Row 3 (18 Aug 2004). That's two.\n- Losses: Row 6 (28 Jan 2009) and Row 7 (9 Sep 2009). Also two.\n\nSo yes, the claim is incorrect. The relevant cells are all the rows where result is 'draw' or 'loss'.

So I need to check if there's any row in the table where both the competition was a friendly and the date falls in February 2004.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has columns: date, venue, score, result, competition. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0: Date is December 16, 2002. Competition is Arab Nations Cup. So not a friendly and date isn't February 2004. Doesn't fit.\n\nRow 1: October 17, 2003. Competition is Asian Cup Qualification. Again, not friendly and wrong year.\n\nRow 2: February 18, 2004. That's the right month and year. Now checking the competition column here\u2014it says \"World Cup qualification\". Not a friendly. So this doesn't fit either.\n\nRow 3: August 18, 2004. Competition is Friendly. But the date is August, not February. Close, but not matching both criteria.\n\nRow 4: February 14, 2006. Competition is Friendly. Wait, competition is friendly here, but the year is 2006, not 2004. So doesn't fit.\n\nRow 5: February 22, 2006 again. Same as above, it's a friendly in February but in 2006, so no.\n\nRows 6 and beyond don't have February dates or are not friendlies in the right year.\n\nSo looking at all the rows, is there any that has both date in February 2004 and competition being friendly? Let me check again:\n\nRow 2: Feb 18, 2004\u2014competition was World Cup Qualification. Not friendly.\nRow 3: August 18, 2004\u2014friendly but wrong month.\n\nTherefore, there's no row where the competition is friendly in February 2004.

The claim says: \"hatem aqel compete in competition end on october 28, 2013 and start december 16, 2003.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what the claim is stating. It mentions two specific dates related to Hatem Aqel's competitions: one ending on October 28, 2013, and another starting on December 16, 2003. I need to check if these dates are present in the table.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has information about a match, including date, venue, score, result, and competition. The claim is about competitions that Hatem Aqel was involved in, specifically their start and end dates.\n\nStarting with December 16, 2003: I'll check the 'date' column for any entries matching this date. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Date is \"16 december 2002\" \u2013 that's close but not 2003.\n- Rows 1 to 8 don't have a date in December 2003. The closest is October 17, 2003 (row 1), but that's not the same as December.\n\nSo there's no entry on December 16, 2003. Therefore, the claim about starting on that date isn't supported by the table.\n\nNext, checking for a competition ending on October 28, 2013: Again, looking through each row's 'date' column:\n\n- The last relevant date is in row 8: \"28 october 2013.\" So there is an entry on that date. However, the claim says it's the end of a competition. I need to verify if this was the final match or just a single match.\n\nLooking at row 8: It's a friendly match in Amman with a result of \"win\" against Jordan. But the table doesn't provide information about whether this was the start or end of a competition. It only lists individual matches, not the entire span of competitions.\n\nTherefore, while there is a match on October 28, 2013, the claim that it's the end date isn't directly supported because we don't know if that was the last match of a competition. The table doesn't specify start and end dates for each competition beyond individual matches.\n\nMoreover, since December 16, 2003, isn't present at all, the claim about starting on that date is false. Even if there were an entry in October 2013, without evidence of a starting point in December 2003, the overall claim isn't supported.\n\nHence, both parts of the claim aren't fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions specific start and end dates for Hatem Aqel's competitions. The table doesn't have an entry on December 16, 2003, so the start date is false. While there's a match on October 28, 2013, it's not confirmed as the competition's end.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 1 less friendly competition than afc asian cup qualification\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that there is one fewer friendly competition compared to AFC Asian Cup qualifications.\n\nTo verify this, I should count how many times each of these competitions appears in the table.\n\nLooking at the \"competition\" column:\n\n1. 2002 Arab Nations Cup\n2. 2004 AFC Asian Cup qualification\n3. 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification\n4. friendly\n5. friendly\n6. 2007 AFC Asian Cup qualification\n7. 2011 AFC Asian Cup qualification\n8. friendly\n9. friendly\n\nNow, let's count the occurrences:\n\n- Friendly competitions: Rows 3, 4, 8, and 9 are \"friendly\". Wait, actually looking back, rows 3 is index 3 which is \"friendly\", row 4 (index 4) is also \"friendly\", then row 8 (index 8) is another friendly. So that's three friendlies? Or wait, let me recount:\n\nLooking at the data array indexes:\n\n- Index 0: 2002 Arab Nations Cup\n- Index 1: 2004 AFC Asian Cup qualification\n- Index 2: 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification\n- Index 3: friendly\n- Index 4: friendly\n- Index 5: 2007 AFC Asian Cup qualification\n- Index 6: 2011 AFC Asian Cup qualification\n- Index 7: friendly\n- Index 8: friendly\n\nSo, how many \"friendly\" are there? Let's count:\n\nIndex 3: yes\nIndex 4: yes\nIndex 7: yes\nIndex 8: yes\n\nWait no, index 6 is \"2011 AFC Asian Cup qualification\", and index 7 is \"friendly\". So from the data array:\n\n- Row 3 (index 3): friendly\n- Row 4 (index 4): friendly\n- Row 7 (index 7): friendly\n- Row 8 (index 8): friendly\n\nWait, that's four rows with \"friendly\" as the competition.\n\nNow AFC Asian Cup qualifications: Looking for competitions starting with \"2004 AFC Asian Cup qualification\", \"2007 AFC...\", and \"2011 AFC...\".\n\nSo:\n\nIndex 1: 2004 AFC\nIndex 5: 2007 AFC\nIndex 6: 2011 AFC\n\nThat's three AFC Asian Cup qualifications.\n\nNow the claim is that there are one less friendly competitions than AFC Asian Cup qualifications. So if AFC has 3, then friendlies should have 2? But according to my count, friendlies are 4 and AFC is 3. That would mean friendlies are more by 1, not less.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the friendly competitions:\n\nLooking at each row's competition:\n\nRow 0: 2002 Arab Nations Cup \u2192 no\nRow 1: 2004 AFC Asian Cup qualification \u2192 yes (AFC)\nRow 2: 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2192 not AFC\nRow 3: friendly \u2192 count as friendly\nRow 4: friendly \u2192 count\nRow 5: 2007 AFC \u2192 count AFC\nRow 6: 2011 AFC \u2192 count AFC\nRow 7: friendly \u2192 count\nRow 8: friendly \u2192 count\n\nSo friendlies are rows 3,4,7,8 \u2192 that's four.\n\nAFC qualifications are rows 1,5,6 \u2192 three.\n\nThe claim says there is one less friendly than AFC. But according to this, AFC has three and friendlies have four. So friendlies are actually more by one, which contradicts the claim. Therefore, the claim would be FALSE.\n\nWait, but let me check again because maybe I'm miscounting. Let's list all competitions:\n\n1. 2002 Arab Nations Cup\n2. 2004 AFC Asian Cup qualification (AFC)\n3. 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification\n4. friendly (F)\n5. friendly (F)\n6. 2007 AFC Asian Cup qualification (AFC)\n7. 2011 AFC Asian Cup qualification (AFC)\n8. friendly (F)\n9. friendly (F)\n\nSo that's four friendlies and three AFC qualifications.\n\nThus, the claim is that there is one less friendly than AFC. But in reality, friendlies are more by one. So the correct answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there is one fewer friendly competition than AFC Asian Cup qualifications. Counting shows 4 friendlies vs. 3 AFC qualifications. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
