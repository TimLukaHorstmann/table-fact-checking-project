So, my task is to check how many players in the table have a \"+ 3\" under the \"to par\" column.\n\nLooking at the table provided in JSON format, it has columns: place, player, country, score, and to par.

Third row: Julius Boros, To Par is +5.\n4. Fourth row: Jack Fleck, To Par is +5.\n5. Fifth row: Ben Hogan, To Par is +5.\n6. Sixth row: Walker Inman, Jr., To Par is +5.\n7.

Tenth row: Gene Littler, To Par is +9.\n\nFrom this, I can see that the \"to par\" values are either +4, +5, +8, or +9. There's no entry with \"+3\". Therefore, there are zero golfers with a score of +3 in the open as per the table.\n\nSince the claim says there are four such players, but none exist according to the data, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells: I need to look at every row's \"to par\" column because each could potentially have the value \"+3\". So, I'll list all rows where \"to par\" is checked.

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim is referring to.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two players: Jack Fleck and Harvie Ward. I need to check their scores from the table provided. Looking at the table data, I see multiple rows with different \"place\" positions. The columns are place, player, country, score, and to par.\n\nI'll go through each row to find Jack Fleck and Harvie Ward. \n\nLooking at row 2: Player is Julius Boros, not our target. Row 3: Player is Jack Fleck. His score is listed as \"76 + 69 = 145\". So his total score is 145.\n\nNow, looking for Harvie Ward. Scanning the rows, I find row 0 where the player is \"harvie ward (a)\". His score is \"74 + 70 = 144\".\n\nThe claim says Jack Fleck scored less than Harvie Ward. But according to the scores, Jack Fleck has 145 and Harvie Ward has 144. So Jack's score is higher, meaning he didn't score less.\n\nWait, but in golf, lower scores are better. So a lower total score means a better performance. The claim says Jack scored less than Harvie, which would mean Jack's total is lower. But in the table, Jack has 145 and Harvie has 144. Therefore, Jack actually scored higher, so the claim is incorrect.\n\nI should double-check to make sure I didn't mix up any rows or scores. Looking again: yes, row 0 is Harvie with 144, and row 3 is Jack with 145. So the claim that Jack scored less than Harvie is false.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells for this determination. For Harvie Ward (row 0), I need his score. And for Jack Fleck (row 3), his score as well. The \"score\" column is what matters here because it shows their total points.\n\nSo the relevant cells are row 0's score and row 3's score.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Jack Fleck scored less than Harvie Ward, but according to the table, Jack Fleck has a higher score (145) compared to Harvie Ward's 144.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at what the table contains. The columns are place, player, country, score, and to par. There are multiple rows of data with different players and their scores. \n\nThe claim mentions a specific score of 148 and states that three players won the 1955 US Open with that score. Wait, but in golf, there's usually only one winner unless it's a tie. So having three winners sounds unusual. Maybe it's not about winning but being tied at a certain position.\n\nLooking through the table, I need to find all players who have a score of 148. Let me go row by row:\n\n- Row 0: Score is 74 +70 =144 \u2192 no\n- Row1: 67+77=144 \u2192 no\n- Row2: 76+69=145\u2192 no\n- Row3: same as above, still 145\n- Row4: 72+73=145\u2192no\n- Row5: 70+75=145\u2192no\n- Now row6: 79+69=148 \u2192 yes, score is 148. Player is Sam Snead.\n- Row7: Bob Harris with the same score of 148.\n- Row8: Jack Burke Jr., also 71+77=148.\n\nSo that's three players with a score of 148. Now, looking at their places: all are in \"t7\". Hmm, t7 probably means tied for 7th place. So they're not the winners; instead, they're tied for 7th. The top positions are t1 and t3.\n\nWait, so if the claim says three players won with a score of 148, but in reality, they were tied for 7th, then that's incorrect. The actual winners (t1) have a lower score, 144, and there are two players there: Harvie Ward and Tommy Bolt.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because three players with 148 weren't the winners; instead, they were in 7th place.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the lowest score at the us open in 1955 be a +3, which be achieve by 4 golfer.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim carefully. It mentions two main points:\n1. The lowest score was +3.\n2. Four golfers achieved this score.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row has information about place, player, country, score, and to par. The 'to par' column seems relevant here because it shows the score relative to par, which is typically denoted with a '+' or '-' sign. \n\nI'll start by examining the 'to par' values in the table:\n- t1: +4\n- t3: +5\n- t7: +8\n- 10: +9\n\nWait, the claim says +3, but I don't see any entries with '+3' in the 'to par' column. The closest is +4 for two players and +5 for others. So that's a problem because there are no scores of +3 mentioned.\n\nNext, checking how many golfers have the same lowest score. Since all have at least +4 or higher, but none have +3, this part also doesn't hold. Even if I consider the lowest as +4, which is the smallest in the table, only two players (harvie ward and tommy bolt) are tied at t1 with +4.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect. The lowest score wasn't +3, and it wasn't achieved by four golfers. So, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, I'll identify the relevant cells from the table that support this conclusion. For each player, I'll check their 'to par' value to see if any have +3 or how many are at the lowest score.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n- Row 0: \"+4\"\n- Row 1: \"+4\"\n- Rows 2-5: \"+5\"\n- Rows 6-8: \"+8\"\n- Row 9: \"+9\"\n\nSo, only rows 0 and 1 have the lowest 'to par' of +4. There's no row with '+3', so none of them support the claim.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the 'to par' entries for all players to show that there's no +3 and that only two achieved +4.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the table shows the lowest score as +4, not +3, and only two golfers achieved this score.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
