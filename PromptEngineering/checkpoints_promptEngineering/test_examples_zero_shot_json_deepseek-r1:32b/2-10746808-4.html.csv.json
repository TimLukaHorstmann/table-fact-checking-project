    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the crowd surpass 19000 for 3 match on 22 may 1926.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The key elements here are:\n1. The crowd count exceeding 19,000.\n2. This happening in three matches.\n3. All these matches took place on May 22, 1926.\n\nLooking at the table structure provided in JSON format, I can see that each row represents a match with details like home team, away team, venue, crowd number, and date. The columns are \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", \"away team score\", \"venue\", \"crowd\", and \"date\".\n\nSince the claim is about three matches on a specific date where the crowd was over 19,000, I'll need to check each row in the data array for two things: whether the date is May 22, 1926, and if the crowd number exceeds 19,000.\n\nGoing through each row:\n- Row 0: Collingwood vs Melbourne. Crowd is 15,000 on May 22, 1926.\n- Row 1: Carlton vs South Melbourne. Crowd is 25,000 on the same date.\n- Row 2: Richmond vs Hawthorn. Crowd is 14,000.\n- Row 3: North Melbourne vs Geelong. Crowd is 14,000.\n- Row 4: St Kilda vs Fitzroy. Crowd is 22,000.\n- Row 5: Footscray vs Essendon. Crowd is 20,000.\n\nNow, I'll count how many of these matches on May 22, 1926 had a crowd over 19,000:\n- Row 1: 25,000 (exceeds)\n- Row 4: 22,000 (exceeds)\n- Row 5: 20,000 (exceeds)\n\nThat's three matches where the crowd was more than 19,000. Rows 0, 2, and 3 have crowds below that threshold but are still on the same date.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there are exactly three matches on May 22, 1926 with a crowd exceeding 19,000. The relevant cells are the \"crowd\" column in rows 1, 4, and 5 since those are the ones that meet the condition.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this table in JSON format with six matches played on the same date, May 22, 1926. The claim is that \"for the 6 match the venue be never the same.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked here. The user wants to check if all six matches were held at different venues\u2014meaning no two matches took place at the same location. If every match has a unique venue, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a single match with details like home team, away team, score, venue, crowd, and date. My focus here is on the \"venue\" column across all six rows to check for uniqueness.\n\nLet me list out the venues one by one:\n\n1. First match: Victoria Park\n2. Second match: Princes Park\n3. Third match: Punt Road Oval\n4. Fourth match: Arden Street Oval\n5. Fifth match: Junction Oval\n6. Sixth match: Western Oval\n\nNow, I'll go through each venue to see if there are any duplicates.\n\n- Victoria Park appears only once.\n- Princes Park is unique in the list.\n- Punt Road Oval is listed once.\n- Arden Street Oval is another distinct venue.\n- Junction Oval and Western Oval also don't repeat anywhere else in the table.\n\nSo, each of the six matches has a different venue. None of them share the same location. This means that for all six matches, every venue was unique\u2014each one took place at a different spot. Therefore, the claim that \"the venue be never the same\" across all six matches holds true.\n\nI should also note which cells I checked to verify this. The relevant information is in the \"venue\" column of each row from 0 to 5.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_venues\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"richmond defeat hawthorn by 12 point at punt road oval\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. The home team is Richmond.\n2. The away team is Hawthorn.\n3. Richmond defeated Hawthorn.\n4. The margin of victory was 12 points.\n5. The venue was Punt Road Oval.\n\nNow, I'll go through each part step by step using the data from the table.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows. Let me scan each row to find where Richmond and Hawthorn played.\n\nIn the third row (index 2), I see:\n\n- Home team: Richmond\n- Away team: Hawthorn\n- Venue: Punt Road Oval\n\nSo that matches part of the claim already. Now, checking the scores:\n\nRichmond's score is listed as \"16.16  (112)\", and Hawthorn's score is \"14.16  (100)\". \n\nIn Australian rules football, the score format is goals.behinds (total points). Each goal is worth 6 points, and each behind is worth 1 point.\n\nCalculating Richmond's total: 16 goals * 6 = 96 points plus 16 behinds * 1 = 16 points. Total is 96 + 16 = 112 points.\nHawthorn's total: 14 goals * 6 = 84 points plus 16 behinds * 1 = 16 points. Total is 84 + 16 = 100 points.\n\nThe difference in points between Richmond and Hawthorn is 112 - 100 = 12 points. So Richmond won by exactly 12 points, which matches the claim.\n\nAlso, the venue was Punt Road Oval, as stated in the claim.\n\nAll parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Richmond defeated Hawthorn by 12 points at Punt Road Oval according to the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"collingwood defeat melbourne by 5 points in front of 15000\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided in JSON format. The columns are: \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", \"away team score\", \"venue\", \"crowd\", and \"date\". Each row contains data for a specific match on 22 May 1926.\n\nThe claim mentions Collingwood defeating Melbourne by 5 points with a crowd of 15,000. I'll need to check each part of this statement against the table.\n\nStarting with the teams: The first row has \"collingwood\" as the home team and \"melbourne\" as the away team. So that's the match we're looking at.\n\nNext, let's verify the scores. Collingwood's score is listed as \"12.12 (84)\" and Melbourne's is \"12.7 (79)\". In Australian rules football, the score format is goals.behinds, with the total points in parentheses. Each goal is worth 6 points, and each behind is worth 1 point.\n\nCalculating Collingwood's total: 12 goals * 6 = 72 points plus 12 behinds * 1 = 12 points, totaling 84 points. Melbourne has 12 goals * 6 = 72 points plus 7 behinds * 1 = 7 points, totaling 79 points.\n\nThe point difference is 84 (Collingwood) minus 79 (Melbourne), which equals 5 points. So Collingwood did indeed defeat Melbourne by exactly 5 points.\n\nNow, checking the crowd number: The \"crowd\" column for this match shows 15000. This matches the claim that the game was played in front of 15,000 people.\n\nSince all parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table\u2014Collingwood's victory by 5 points and the crowd figure\u2014the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break down each part of the claim and check it against the data.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row where the home team is \"st kilda\". Scanning through the data array:\n\nRow 4: [\"st kilda\", ...] \u2013 that's the one we're interested in.\n\nNow, let's verify each component step by step.\n\n1. **Home Team vs Away Team**: The claim says st kilda defeated fitzroy. Looking at row 4, \"home team\" is \"st kilda\" and \"away team\" is \"fitzroy\". So that matches.\n\n2. **Venue**: The claim mentions \"junction oval\". In the same row, the \"venue\" column shows \"junction oval\", which aligns with the claim.\n\n3. **Date**: The claim states the date as \"22 may 1926\". Checking the \"date\" column in row 4 confirms that it's indeed \"22 may 1926\".\n\nNext, I need to confirm the score difference. The scores are given in the format \"12.12 (84)\", which typically represents goals and behinds with a total in brackets.\n\nFor st kilda: The score is \"9.8 (62)\". Calculating that, 9*6 + 8 = 54 +8=62.\nFitzroy's score: \"7.9 (51)\" \u2013 so 7*6 +9=42+9=51.\n\nThe claim says st kilda defeated fitzroy by 11 points.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"the crowd be unable to surpass 19000 for 3 of the match on 22 may 1926\". \n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. The claim is stating that in three out of the matches played on May 22, 1926, the crowd numbers didn't reach or exceed 19,000 people.\n\nLooking at the table, I see six rows, each representing a different match with details like home team, away team, venue, and importantly, the crowd number. All the dates listed are \"22 may 1926\", so all these matches were on that day.\n\nThe relevant column for this claim is the \"crowd\" column because it contains the numbers we need to check against the threshold of 19,000. Let me go through each row's crowd number:\n\n1. First match: Collingwood vs Melbourne at Victoria Park - Crowd is 15,000.\n2. Second match: Carlton vs South Melbourne at Princes Park - Crowd is 25,000.\n3. Third match: Richmond vs Hawthorn at Punt Road Oval - Crowd is 14,000.\n4. Fourth match: North Melbourne vs Geelong at Arden Street Oval - Crowd is 14,000.\n5. Fifth match: St Kilda vs Fitzroy at Junction Oval - Crowd is 22,000.\n6. Sixth match: Footscray vs Essendon at Western Oval - Crowd is 20,000.\n\nNow, I need to count how many of these crowds did NOT surpass 19,000. Let's list each:\n\n- 15,000: This is less than 19,000.\n- 25,000: This is more than 19,000.\n- 14,000: Less than 19k.\n- 14,000: Also less.\n- 22,000: More than 19k.\n- 20,000: This is exactly on the edge. Wait, does \"surpass\" mean strictly more? Yes, surpass means to go beyond, so 20,000 would be above 19,000.\n\nWait, no, actually, 20,000 is greater than 19,000 because 19k is the threshold. So if a crowd is 20,000, it surpasses 19k. Therefore, in this case:\n\nMatches where crowd did NOT surpass 19k (i.e., \u226419,000):\n\n- 15,000: Yes\n- 25,000: No\n- 14,000: Yes\n- 14,000: Yes\n- 22,000: No\n- 20,000: Does this count as surpassing? Since 20k is more than 19k, it does surpass.\n\nSo how many matches didn't surpass 19k?\n\nLet's list them:\n\nRow 0 (Collingwood): 15k - did not surpass\nRow 2 (Richmond): 14k - did not\nRow 3 (North Melbourne): 14k - did not\n\nWait, but row indexes are from 0 to 5. So rows 0, 2, and 3 have crowd \u226419k.\n\nThat's three matches where the crowd didn't surpass 19k. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because exactly three of the six matches had crowds that did not exceed 19,000.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_2_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_3_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"richmond be unable to defeat hawthorn at punt road oval\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The key elements here are:\n\n1. **Richmond** vs. **Hawthorn**: So we're looking for a match between these two teams.\n2. **Unable to defeat**: This suggests that Richmond lost or didn't win against Hawthorn.\n3. **At punt road oval**: We need to check if the venue where this match took place was indeed Punt Road Oval.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it's structured with columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. The data is presented in rows, each representing a different game on May 22, 1926.\n\nLet me go through each row to find where Richmond plays Hawthorn at Punt Road Oval.\n\n- **Row 0**: Collingwood vs Melbourne at Victoria Park. Not relevant.\n- **Row 1**: Carlton vs South Melbourne at Princes Park. Still not the teams we're looking for.\n- **Row 2**: Richmond (home team) vs Hawthorn (away team) at Punt Road Oval. This matches the venue mentioned in the claim. \n   - Home team score: 16.16 (112)\n   - Away team score: 14.16 (100)\n\nSo, according to this row, Richmond scored higher than Hawthorn. The scores are represented as goals.behinds (total points). Calculating the total for each:\n\n- Richmond: 16 goals and 16 behinds = (16*6) + 16 = 96 + 16 = 112 points.\n- Hawthorn: 14 goals and 16 behinds = (14*6) +16 = 84 + 16 = 100 points.\n\nSince Richmond's total is higher (112 vs. 100), they won the match. \n\nNow, evaluating the claim: \"Richmond be unable to defeat Hawthorn...\" If Richmond actually defeated them, then the claim would be false because it suggests Richmond couldn't win, but they did.\n\nWait a second, maybe I misread. Let me double-check. The claim says Richmond was unable to defeat, meaning they lost. But according to the table, Richmond won with 112 points compared to Hawthorn's 100. So the claim is incorrect because Richmond did defeat Hawthorn at that venue.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE. \n\nBut wait, I need to make sure all conditions are met:\n\n- The match was between Richmond and Hawthorn: Yes.\n- The venue was Punt Road Oval: Correct.\n- Did Richmond lose? No, they won.\n\nHence, the claim is false because Richmond did defeat Hawthorn at that venue.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells. In row 2 (index starting from 0), the home team is Richmond, away team is Hawthorn, venue is Punt Road Oval. Also, their scores are crucial to determine who won. So I'll include:\n\n- \"home team\" column in row 2.\n- \"away team\" column in row 2.\n- \"venue\" column in row 2.\n- Both \"home team score\" and \"away team score\" in row 2.\n\nWait, but do I need all of those? The claim is about Richmond being unable to defeat Hawthorn at Punt Road Oval. So the key points are:\n\n1. Which teams played (Richmond vs. Hawthorn).\n2. Where they played (Punt Road Oval).\n3. Who won (did Richmond lose?).\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- home team: to confirm it's Richmond.\n- away team: to confirm it's Hawthorn.\n- venue: to confirm location.\n- home team score and away team score: to see who won.\n\nTherefore, all these columns in row 2 are relevant. \n\nWait, but sometimes the minimal cells needed might be just the teams, venue, and scores. So perhaps I should include all those columns for row 2 because each contributes to verifying parts of the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Richmond defeated Hawthorn at Punt Road Oval on May 22, 1926.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"collingwood lose to melbourne by 5 point in front of 15000 spectator\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. **Home Team and Away Team**: The home team is Collingwood, and the away team is Melbourne.\n2. **Result**: Collingwood loses to Melbourne by 5 points.\n3. **Crowd Size**: There are 15,000 spectators.\n\nNow, I'll check each part against the table data.\n\nLooking at the first row of the table:\n- Home team: Collingwood\n- Away team: Melbourne\n\nSo that's correct for the teams involved.\n\nNext, checking the scores. The home team score is \"12.12 (84)\", and the away team score is \"12.7 (79)\". In Australian rules football, the score format is Goals.Behinds (Total Points). Each goal is 6 points, and each behind is 1 point.\n\nCalculating Collingwood's total: 12 goals * 6 = 72 + 12 behinds * 1 = 84. So their total is 84 points.\nMelbourne's score: 12 goals * 6 = 72 + 7 behinds * 1 = 79 points. Total is 79.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the claim says Collingwood lost by 5 points. But according to these totals, Collingwood scored higher (84) than Melbourne (79). So actually, Collingwood won by 5 points, not lost. That means the claim is incorrect on the result.\n\nAdditionally, checking the crowd: The first row shows a crowd of 15000, which matches the claim's spectator count.\n\nBut since the outcome is reversed\u2014Collingwood won instead of losing\u2014the entire claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Collingwood lost to Melbourne by 5 points in front of 15,000 spectators. The table shows Collingwood scored higher (84) than Melbourne (79), indicating Collingwood won. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"fitzroy lose to st kilda by 11 point at junction oval on 22 march 1926\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down each part of the claim and see if it matches the information in the JSON table.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several rows, each representing a match. Each row has details like home team, their score, away team, their score, venue, crowd, and date. Let's go through each element:\n\n1. **Teams Involved**: The claim mentions Fitzroy losing to St Kilda. In the table, I see that in one of the rows (the fifth row), the home team is \"st kilda\" with a score of 9.8 (62), and the away team is \"fitzroy\" with 7.9 (51). So yes, Fitzroy is playing against St Kilda.\n\n2. **Result of the Game**: The claim says Fitzroy lost by 11 points. Let's calculate the scores. For St Kilda: 9 goals and 8 behinds. Each goal is worth 6 points, so 9*6 = 54 plus 8 behinds (each worth 1 point) makes 8, totaling 62 points. Fitzroy has 7 goals (7*6=42) and 9 behinds (9), totaling 51 points. The difference is 62 - 51 = 11 points. So that checks out.\n\n3. **Venue**: The claim states the venue is junction oval. Looking at the row, under \"venue\" it's indeed \"junction oval\". That matches.\n\n4. **Date of the Match**: The claim says \"22 march 1926\", but in the table, the date for that match is listed as \"22 may 1926\". March vs May are different months, so this part doesn't match.\n\nSince the date doesn't align (March vs May), even though the other details are correct, the claim has an incorrect date. Therefore, the overall statement isn't entirely true because of the wrong month mentioned.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions Fitzroy losing to St Kilda by 11 points at junction oval on March 22, 1926. According to the table, while Fitzroy did lose to St Kilda by 11 points at junction oval, the date was May 22, 1926, not March.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
