Let me start by understanding what's in the table.\n\nThe table has columns: date, venue, score, comp (which I assume stands for competition), and report. The data rows go from February to June 1998. \n\nFirst, I'll look for entries where \"comp\" is \"kirin cup\". Let me scan through each row:\n\n- Row 5: Date is May 17, 1998; comp is kirin cup.\n- Row 6: Date is May 21, 1998; comp is kirin cup.\n\nSo both dates mentioned in the claim are present and associated with the kirin cup. The rest of the rows don't mention kirin cup except these two. \n\nNow, the claim says there were games on both May 17 and 21. Since both entries exist in the table under the correct competition, it seems the claim is accurate.\n\nI'll note the relevant cells for verification:\n- For May 17: row index 5 (since rows start at 0), column 'comp'.\n- For May 21: row index 6, same column.\n\nEverything checks out, so the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows two Kirin Cup matches on May 17 and May 21, 1998.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format. The claim is: \"the world cup have 4 game throughout june 1998, all of which be in france.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its key points:\n1. There were 4 World Cup games in June 1998.\n2. All these games took place in France.\n\nI'll start by looking through each row of the table to identify entries related to the World Cup and occurring in June 1998.\n\nLooking at the \"date\" column, I see that several rows have dates in June 1998:\n- Row 10: \"1998-06-12\"\n- Row 11: \"1998-06-19\"\n- Row 12: \"1998-06-24\"\n- Row 13: \"1998-06-28\"\n\nThat's four entries in total, which matches the first part of the claim (4 games).\n\nNext, I'll check the venue for each of these rows to see if they are all in France:\n- Row 10: Venue is \"stade de la mosson montpellier, france\" \u2192 France\n- Row 11: Venue is \"stade geoffroy - guichard saint - \u00e9tienne, france\" \u2192 France\n- Row 12: Venue is \"stade de toulouse toulouse, france\" \u2192 France\n- Row 13: Venue is \"stade F\u00e9lix Bollaert Lens, france\" \u2192 France\n\nAll four venues are indeed in France. Additionally, the \"comp\" column for these rows indicates \"world cup,\" confirming they are World Cup games.\n\nTherefore, both conditions of the claim are satisfied:\n- There were exactly 4 World Cup games in June 1998.\n- All these games took place in France.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies or additional entries that would affect this conclusion.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"neither team score for the first 2 game of the world cup in france\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that neither team scored in both of the first two World Cup games held in France. So, essentially, both games ended with a score of 0-0.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are multiple entries, some under \"world cup\" as the competition. I need to identify which rows correspond to the World Cup matches in France. The table has columns: date, venue, score, comp, and report. \n\nI'll go through each row to find where the competition is \"world cup\". Let's check:\n\n- Rows 10 to 13 have \"comp\" as \"world cup\". So these are the World Cup matches.\n\nNow, among these, I need to determine which ones are in France. The venue column gives that information. \n\nLooking at each of the relevant rows:\n- Row 10: Venue is \"stade de la mosson montpellier, france\". That's in France.\n- Row 11: Venue is \"stade geoffroy - guichard saint - \u00e9tienne, france\". Also in France.\n- Row 12: Venue is \"stade de toulouse toulouse, france\". Again, France.\n- Row 13: Venue is \"stade felix bollaert lens, france\". France as well.\n\nSo all four of these are World Cup matches in France. But the claim refers to the first two games. So I need to figure out which ones are the first two.\n\nLooking at the dates:\n- Row 10: Date is \"1998-06-12\"\n- Row 11: \"1998-06-19\"\n- Row 12: \"1998-06-24\"\n- Row 13: \"1998-06-28\"\n\nSo the earliest dates are June 12 and June 19. These would be the first two World Cup games in France.\n\nNow, checking their scores:\n- Row 10 score is \"0 - 0\". So both teams didn't score.\n- Row 11 score is also \"0 - 0\".\n\nWait a minute, that's interesting. The claim says neither team scored for the first two games. But according to the table, both of these matches ended in 0-0 draws, which means indeed neither team scored goals in each game? Wait, no\u2014no, actually, in a 0-0 draw, both teams didn't score, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if \"neither team scored\" refers to both games combined or each individually. The wording is a bit ambiguous, but the claim says \"for the first 2 game of the world cup in france\", which probably means both games had no scores.\n\nSo looking at rows 10 and 11: Both have 0-0 scores. So neither team scored in either of these two games.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if there are any other World Cup matches before these dates that might be considered the first two in France. But from the table, all World Cup matches are starting from June 12th onwards, so those are indeed the first two.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, both of the first two World Cup games in France ended with scores of 0-0, meaning neither team scored in either game. So the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the game on june 18 and 28 , 1998 both have a score of 1 - 1\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions two dates: June 18 and June 28, 1998, and states that both games had a score of 1-1. My task is to check these details against the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns for date, venue, score, comp, and report. Each row represents a game with its corresponding details.\n\nI'll start by checking each row's date to see if any fall on June 18 or June 28, 1998.\n\nGoing through the data rows:\n\nRow 0: Date is February 8, 1998.\nRow 1: March 14, 1998.\nRow 2: March 18, 1998.\nRow 3: March 28, 1998. Wait, this is March, not June.\nRow 4: April 22, 1998.\nRow 5: May 17, 1998.\nRow 6: May 21, 1998.\nRow 7: June 1, 1998.\nRow 8: June 3, 1998.\nRow 9: June 6, 1998.\nRow 10: June 12, 1998.\nRow 11: June 19, 1998. That's one of the dates mentioned in the claim.\nRow 12: June 24, 1998.\nRow 13: June 28, 1998. This is the second date.\n\nSo, the relevant rows are row 11 (June 19) and row 13 (June 28). Wait, but the claim was about June 18 and 28. Hmm, there's no game on June 18 in the table. Row 11 is June 19, not 18. That might be a mistake. However, let's proceed.\n\nLooking at row 13 (June 28), the score is listed as \"0 - 0 (1 - 0 aet)\". So that's 0-0 in regular time with an AET result of 1-0. The claim states both games have a score of 1-1, but June 28 has a different score.\n\nWait, did I miss the June 18 game? Let me check again. The dates are as follows: row 10 is June 12, then row 11 is June 19, so there's no entry for June 18. That means the claim mentions June 18, but it doesn't exist in the table. So perhaps that part is incorrect.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't misread any rows. Let's go through each row:\n\nRow indices are from 0 to 13. The dates after May are:\n\nRow 7: June 1\nRow 8: June 3\nRow 9: June 6\nRow 10: June 12\nRow 11: June 19\nRow 12: June 24\nRow 13: June 28\n\nNo June 18, so the claim's first part about June 18 is incorrect. But maybe it was a typo? Let's see if any of these have a score of 1-1.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: 4-0\nRow 1: 2-2\nRow 2: 1-1\nRow 3: 1-1\nRow 4: 5-5? Wait, no\u2014row 4's comp is \"Employees\" but wait, let me check again. No, the columns are date, venue, score, comp, report.\n\nWait, row 2 has a score of 1-1 (March 18), row 3 also has 1-1 (March 28). Then row 11: June 19's score is \"0 - 0\". Row 13: June 28's score is \"0 - 0\".\n\nSo, the games on March 18 and March 28 have scores of 1-1. But the claim refers to June 18 and June 28.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps there was confusion between March and June? Or maybe I misread the dates. Let me check row indices again:\n\nRow 0: Feb\nRow 1: Mar\nRow 2: Mar 18 (score 1-1)\nRow 3: Mar 28 (score 1-1)\nRow 4: Apr\nRow 5: May\nRow 6: May\nRow 7: Jun 1\nRow 8: Jun 3\nRow 9: Jun 6\nRow 10: Jun 12 (score \"0 - 0\")\nRow 11: Jun 19 (score \"0 - 0\")\nRow 12: Jun 24 (score \"0 - 0\")\nRow 13: Jun 28 (score \"0 - 0 (1 - 0 aet)\")\n\nSo, the only games with score 1-1 are in March. The claim mentions June dates, which don't have scores of 1-1. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, but the user's question was about June 18 and June 28. Since there's no game on June 18, that part is false. Also, June 28 has a different score. So both parts are not true.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to games on June 18 and June 28, but the table does not have a game on June 18 and shows different scores for June 28. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It's stating that there were games for the Kirin Cup on June 1st and June 3rd, 1998. I need to check if these two specific dates have any entries related to the Kirin Cup in the table.\n\nLooking at the JSON data, the table has columns: date, venue, score, comp (which probably stands for competition), and report. The claim is about the 'comp' column indicating \"kirin cup\" on those specific dates.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to find entries where 'comp' is \"kirin cup\". Let's go through each data row one by one:\n\n1. First row: date 1998-02-08, comp \"f\" \u2192 Not Kirin Cup.\n2. Second row: 1998-03-14, comp \"f\" \u2192 Not relevant.\n3. Third row: 1998-03-18, comp \"f\" \u2192 Still not.\n4. Fourth row: 1998-03-28, comp \"f\" \u2192 No match here either.\n5. Fifth row: 1998-04-22, comp \"f\" \u2192 Not Kirin Cup.\n6. Sixth row: 1998-05-17, comp \"kirin cup\" \u2192 This is the first Kirin Cup entry. The date here is May 17th, which doesn't match June 1st or 3rd.\n7. Seventh row: 1998-05-21, comp \"kirin cup\" \u2192 Another Kirin Cup game on May 21st. Still not the dates in question.\n8. Eighth row: 1998-06-01, comp \"f\" \u2192 Here's June 1st, but it's under 'f', not Kirin Cup. So this doesn't support the claim for a Kirin Cup game on June 1st.\n9. Ninth row: 1998-06-03, comp \"f\" \u2192 Similarly, June 3rd is here with 'comp' as \"f\". No Kirin Cup on this date either.\n\nContinuing through the rest of the rows:\n10.

Twelfth row: 1998-06-19, comp \"world cup\" \u2192 Also not Kirin Cup.\n13. Thirteenth row: 1998-06-24, comp \"world cup\".\n14. Fourteenth row: 1998-06-28, comp \"world cup\".\n\nFrom this examination, I found that the only Kirin Cup games were on May 17th and May 21st, both in 1998. There are no entries for June 1st or June 3rd where 'comp' is \"kirin cup\". The rows with dates June 1st and June 3rd (rows 6 and 8) have 'comp' as \"f\", which likely stands for another competition, perhaps Friendly matches.\n\nTherefore, the claim that there were Kirin Cup games on both June 1st and June 3rd, 1998, is FALSE because those specific dates don't show any Kirin Cup competitions in the provided data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"comp\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"comp\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The relevant columns here are \"date\", \"venue\", \"score\", and \"comp\". \n\nThe claim mentions \"the first game of the world cup in france.\" So I need to find the World Cup matches held in France. Let's scan through the data:\n\n- Rows 10, 11, 12, and 13 are marked with \"world cup\" under the \"comp\" column.\n  \nRow 10:\n- Date: 1998-06-12\n- Venue: stade de la mosson montpellier, france\n- Score: 0 - 0\n\nRow 11:\n- Date: 1998-06-19\n- Venue: stade geoffroy-guichard saint-\u00c9tienne, france\n- Score: 0 - 0\n\nRow 12:\n- Date: 1998-06-24\n- Venue: stade de toulouse toulouse, france\n- Score: 1 - 3\n\nRow 13:\n- Date: 1998-06-28\n- Venue: stade F\u00e9lix Bollaert Lens, france\n- Score: 0 - 0 (1 - 0 aet)\n\nNow, the claim refers to \"the first game of the World Cup in France.\" Looking at the dates, Row 10 is the earliest with June 12. So this would be the first World Cup match in France listed here.\n\nThe score for that match is 0-0, meaning neither team scored. That directly supports the claim because both teams failed to score in the first game.\n\nI should also check if there are any other matches before this one under \"world cup\" but in France. However, all World Cup entries start from Row 10 onwards, and it's the first occurrence of a World Cup match in France. \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the first World Cup game in France indeed had neither team scoring.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"comp\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"netherlands and romania have game on june 24 and 28 , respectively , in 1998.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It mentions two specific dates, June 24 and 28, and associates each with a game involving the Netherlands and Romania, respectively.\n\nLooking at the table, the \"date\" column is where I should start. Each row has a date in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD\". I need to check for rows that fall on June 24 (1998-06-24) and June 28 (1998-06-28).\n\nLooking through the dates:\n- The first relevant date is June 24, which corresponds to \"1998-06-24\". Scanning through the data rows, I find that on row index 12, the date is indeed \"1998-06-24\", and the venue is \"stade de toulouse toulouse, france\". The competition here is labeled as \"world cup\" in the \"comp\" column. However, looking at the teams involved isn't directly provided; I only know it's a World Cup match.\n\nNext, June 28 is listed as another date: \"1998-06-28\". Checking row index 13, that's correct. The venue is \"stade f\u00e9lix bollaert lens, france\", and the competition is also \"world cup\".\n\nNow, I need to verify if these two dates correspond to games involving Netherlands and Romania. Looking at the data:\n\nFor June 24 (row 12), the teams are not explicitly mentioned in the table, only that it's a World Cup match. So, without knowing which teams played on that date, I can't confirm whether it was the Netherlands.\n\nSimilarly, for June 28 (row 13), again, no specific team names are provided; only the competition and result are given. The score is \"0-0 (1-0 aet)\", indicating extra time was needed. But without team information, I can't confirm if Romania played on that date.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at other rows, there's an entry on June 3 (row index 8) where the venue is \"steaua stadium bucharest, romania\" and the comp is \"f\". The score was 3-2. But this is on June 3, not June 28.\n\nAnother row on June 19 (row index 10) mentions \"stade geoffroy-guichard saint-\u00e9tiennes, france\", but again, no team names are provided except in the venue description.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I missed some rows. Let's check all dates:\n\n- Rows with \"world cup\" competition start from row index 10 onwards:\n   - Row 10: June 12\n   - Row 11: June 19\n   - Row 12: June 24\n   - Row 13: June 28\n\nLooking at these, I don't see any explicit mention of the Netherlands or Romania in the venue names except for row index 8 (June 3) which is Romania's stadium. However, that was on June 3, not June 28.\n\nWait, let me check all venues again:\n\n- Row 10: stade de la mosson montpellier, france\n- Row 11: stade geoffroy-guichard saint-\u00e9tiennes, france\n- Row 12: stade de toulouse toulouse, france\n- Row 13: stade f\u00e9lix bollaert lens, france\n\nSo all the World Cup matches in this table are held in France. The venues don't mention Netherlands or Romania as hosts. Therefore, it's possible that these matches involve teams from other countries.\n\nBut without explicit team names, I can't confirm whether the Netherlands played on June 24 or Romania on June 28. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is referring to when each team played their respective matches in the World Cup.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the Netherlands and Romania were both participating teams in the 1998 World Cup held in France. So they would have had group stage matches around those dates.\n\nLooking up historical data (though as an AI, I don't have real-time access), I know that the 1998 World Cup group stages included the Netherlands and Romania. The Netherlands played their first match on June 12 against Saudi Arabia, then on June 24 against Ecuador in Group C. Romania played their matches around June 13, 18, and 23.\n\nWait, so according to this, the Netherlands had a match on June 24 (row index 12) as per the table. But the venue is Toulouse, France. So that's correct. And Romania might have played on June 23, not 28. Alternatively, perhaps they played another game.\n\nBut according to the table provided, there's no mention of any team names except in the venues for row index 8 (Romania). The rest only list the venue as a location in France without specifying which teams are playing.\n\nTherefore, based solely on the given table:\n\n- On June 24, there was a World Cup match at Toulouse. If that was the Netherlands vs. Ecuador, then it's correct.\n- On June 28, the last game in the table is at Lens, France. If Romania played on June 23 instead of 28, then this might not be accurate.\n\nBut without explicit team names, I can't confirm if these dates correspond to matches involving Netherlands and Romania respectively. Thus, the claim isn't fully supported by the data provided because we don't have the specific teams playing on those dates.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be verified as true based solely on the given table since it doesn't provide team names for the specified dates, only venues and competition types.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"the game on june 18 and 28 , both have a score of 2 - 0.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look through the data in the table provided. The table has columns: date, venue, score, comp, report. So, for each relevant row, I'll check the 'date' column to see if it's June 18 or 28, and then check the 'score' column to see if it's 2-0.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\nRow 10: Date is \"1998 - 06 - 12\", which is June 12. So not relevant.\nRow 11: Date is \"1998 - 06 - 19\". Hmm, that's June 19th. The claim mentions June 18, so this isn't matching. But wait, the user might have meant June 19? Or maybe a typo. Let me note that.\nRow 12: Date is \"1998 - 06 - 24\", which is June 24th. Not relevant.\nRow 13: Date is \"1998 - 06 - 28\". So, this is one of the dates mentioned in the claim (June 28). The score here is \"0 - 0 ( 1 - 0 aet )\". That's not 2-0.\n\nWait, did I miss June 18? Looking back at all rows:\n\nRows from index 0 to 9 have earlier dates. Let me double-check each row:\n\nRow 0: Feb 8, 1998\nRow 1: March 14\nRow 2: March 18\nRow 3: March 28\nRow 4: April 22\nRow 5: May 17\nRow 6: May 21\nRow 7: June 1\nRow 8: June 3\nRow 9: June 6\nRow 10: June 12\nRow 11: June 19\nRow 12: June 24\nRow 13: June 28\n\nSo, there's no game on June 18. The closest is June 19 and June 12, but none on the 18th. Therefore, for June 18, there's no data in the table. \n\nAs for June 28, the score was 0-0 with aet (after extra time) of 1-0. So that's not 2-0 either.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect. There is no game on June 18 with a 2-0 score, and the game on June 28 didn't have that score either.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions two dates: June 18 and June 28, both supposedly having a score of 2-0.\n\nChecking the table:\n\n- There is no entry for June 18. The closest dates are June 19 and June 12, but not June 18.\n- For June 28 (row index 13), the score was \"0 - 0 ( 1 - 0 aet )\", which doesn't match 2-0.\n\nThus, both parts of the claim are false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
