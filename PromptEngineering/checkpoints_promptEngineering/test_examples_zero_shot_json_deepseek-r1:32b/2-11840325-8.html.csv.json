    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the claim \"In 2012, the oakland raiders lose to the kansas city chief at arrowhead stadium with a result of 15 - 0\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its key components:\n1. **Year**: The event took place in 2012.\n2. **Winner and Loser**: Oakland Raiders lost to Kansas City Chiefs.\n3. **Location**: The game was held at Arrowhead Stadium.\n4. **Result**: The score was 15-0.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row of the table to find any matches for these components.\n\nLooking at the data:\n- **Row 2 (index 2)**: This is from 2011, so it doesn't match the year.\n- **Row 3 (index 3)**: Also from 2011, same reason.\n- **Row 4 (index 4)**: Year is 2012. The winner is Oakland Raiders, which contradicts the claim since the Raiders are supposed to lose. The location is Arrowhead Stadium, but since they're the winners here, this doesn't fit.\n- **Row 5 (index 5)**: Again, year is 2012. The result shows the Raiders winning with a score of 15-0 at Oco Coliseum, not Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nI notice that there are two entries for 2012:\n- In row 4 (index 4), Raiders win 26-16 at Arrowhead.\n- In row 5 (index 5), Raiders win 15-0 at Oco Coliseum.\n\nNeither of these matches the claim where Raiders lose. Additionally, the result mentioned in the claim is 15-0, but in both 2012 entries, it's Raiders winning with that score or another. The location is also inconsistent; one game was at Arrowhead, and the other at Oco Coliseum.\n\nMoreover, I should check if there are any games where Raiders lost in 2012. Looking through the data:\n- All 2012 entries show Raiders as winners. There's no row where they lose against Chiefs that year.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the claim states that Raiders lost to Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium with a result of 15-0 in 2012. However, according to the table, in both 2012 games:\n- They won 26-16 at Arrowhead.\n- They won 15-0 at Oco Coliseum.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because Raiders did not lose; they actually won those games.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
