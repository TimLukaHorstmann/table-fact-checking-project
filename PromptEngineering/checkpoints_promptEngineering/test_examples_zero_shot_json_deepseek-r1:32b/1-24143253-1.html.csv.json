    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"Jill Ireland, Judy Garland, and Walter Matthau all die in the year 2003.\" I need to verify if this is true or false using the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for each person in the table to find their death years.\n\n1. **Jill Ireland**: Scanning through the names, I don't see \"Jill Ireland\" listed. That's a red flag because if she's not in the data, we can't confirm her death year here.\n\n2. **Judy Garland**: Checking each row for Judy Garland... Hmm, I don't find any entry with that name either. So again, no information to verify her death year from this table.\n\n3. **Walter Matthau**: Let's see if he's in the data. Going through the names... Ah, there's an entry for \"Walter Matthau\" under the spouse of someone else? Wait, looking at the structure, each row seems to represent a couple. The first name is the person whose spouse died, and the second column lists the spouse.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify the table structure:\n\nEach row has columns like:\n- Person: The main individual.\n- Spouse: Their partner who passed away.\n- Death cause.\n- Death date (including year).\n- Years married.\n- Children.\n- Marriage status after death.\n\nSo, for example, the first row is about Gene Hackman and his spouse Ruth Ann Lummis Hackman. So, to find if someone died in 2003, I need to look at the \"Death Date\" column of each spouse entry.\n\nBut looking through all spouses:\n\n- Ruth Ann Lummis Hackman: Died in 1985.\n- Jerry Zaks' spouse: Died in 2008.\n- Robert Wagner's spouse Natalie Wood died in 1981. Wait, no\u2014Natalie Wood is the spouse of Robert Wagner and she died in 1981. But wait, looking again, the death dates vary.\n\nWait a minute, I might have misread. Let me look at each row:\n\n- Gene Hackman: Spouse Ruth Ann Lummis Hackman died on 30 August 1985 (year 1985).\n- Jerry Zaks: Spouse Sharon White died in 2008.\n- George Burns: Wife is deceased, died in 1996.\n- Elizabeth Taylor: Spouse Richard Burton died in 1984. \nWait no\u2014Richard Burton was her spouse and he died in 1984.\n\nContinuing down the list, I don't see any death dates from 2003.\n\nLooking for Walter Matthau specifically:\n\nIn the table, one of the rows is about Walter Matthau's spouse. Let me check that row:\n\nYes, looking at the data, under \"Walter Matthau\" as the person, his spouse's death date is listed. Wait no\u2014actually, each row starts with a person and their spouse. So I need to find any entry where the spouse died in 2003.\n\nLooking through all spouses' death dates:\n\n- Ruth Ann Lummis Hackman: 1985\n- Sharon White: 2008\n- Richard Burton: 1984\n- Robert Wagner's spouse: Died in 1981.\n- Gilda Radner died in 1989.\n\nWait, looking at the last few rows:\n\nLooking for any death date ending with 2003. I don't see any entries where the death year is 2003. The closest is Sharon White in 2008 and others like 1985, 1994, etc.\n\nSo, based on this table, none of Jill Ireland, Judy Garland, or Walter Matthau's spouses died in 2003. Additionally, since Jill Ireland and Judy Garland aren't listed as spouses here, their death years can't be confirmed from this data either.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by the information provided. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to verify the claim: \"Charles Alden Black died on August 4, 2005 (aged 86), 10 years older than Arthur Sheekman who died at 76.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two people: Charles Alden Black and Arthur Sheekman. The claim states their death dates and ages, and also that Charles was 10 years older than Arthur.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a person with details in various columns. Let's identify which rows contain these two individuals.\n\nFor Charles Alden Black: I'll search through the \"Name\" column. Scanning down, I find his name in one of the rows. The relevant cells here are his death date and age. From the table, his death date is August 4, 2005, and he was aged 86. So that part matches.\n\nNext, Arthur Sheekman: Again, searching the \"Name\" column, I find his name. His death details show he died on January 12, 1978, at age 76. That also matches the claim.\n\nNow, checking the age difference. Charles was 86 when he died, and Arthur was 76. The difference is indeed 10 years (86 - 76 = 10). So the claim that Charles was 10 years older than Arthur holds true.\n\nI should also ensure there are no discrepancies in other details. For example, I'll verify their spouses or any other related information to make sure nothing contradicts the claim. But since the claim only focuses on their death dates and ages, as well as the age difference, and all those points align with the table data, it seems solid.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the information in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately reflects the data: Charles Alden Black died at 86, Arthur Sheekman at 76, a 10-year difference. The relevant cells confirm these details.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"Died\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"Age at death\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Died\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Age at death\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is about whether Pilar Wayne and John Wayne have 2 daughters and 1 son, and whether Gena Rowlands and John Cassavetes also have the same number of children. I need to verify this against the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll locate Pilar Wayne in the table. Looking through the rows, I see that Pilar Wayne is listed under row index 30. The relevant columns here are \"Name\" and \"Children\". According to the data, they have \"2 daughters (Aissa, Marisa) 1 son (John)\". So yes, that's exactly what the claim states.\n\nNext, I'll check Gena Rowlands and John Cassavetes. Gena Rowlands is in row index 25. Her children are listed as \"2 daughters (Alexandra, Zoe) 1 son (Nick)\". Again, this matches the claim of having 2 daughters and 1 son.\n\nSince both pairs have the same number and type of children as stated in the claim, the information supports it fully.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"Children\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Children\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is that both John Wayne and Gilda Radner died of cancer\u2014specifically, stomach cancer for John and ovarian cancer for Gilda. I need to verify each part of this claim using the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for information about John Wayne in the table. Scanning through the rows, I find Pilar Wayne listed as his wife. The relevant columns here are \"Cause of Death\" and \"Spouse\". For John Wayne, under \"Cause of Death\", it says \"stomach cancer.\" That's a direct match with the claim regarding his cause of death.\n\nNext, I'll check Gilda Radner's information. Looking through the table again, I see that Gene Wilder is listed as her spouse. The \"Cause of Death\" for Gilda Radner mentions \"ovarian cancer,\" which aligns perfectly with the second part of the claim about her cause of death.\n\nNow, I need to ensure both these pieces of information are correct and present in the table. John Wayne's entry clearly states his cause of death as stomach cancer, and Gilda Radner's entry specifies ovarian cancer. Both facts are accurate according to their respective rows in the table.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are supported by the data provided, the overall statement holds true.

From the table, I see a row where one of the names is \"Pilar Wayne\" in the Spouse column. The relevant information here would be the Children column for that row. Looking at it, it says: 2 daughters (Aissa, Marisa) and 1 son (John). So they have three children, which contradicts the claim that they have no child.\n\nNext, checking the other part of the claim about Gene Rowlands and John Cassvetes having three children. In the table, I find a row with Gene Rowlands as Spouse. The Children column shows: 2 daughters (Alexandra, Zoe) and 1 son (Nick). That's three children in total, which aligns with the second part of the claim.\n\nWait a minute, but the first part is incorrect because John Wayne and Pilar Wayne do have children.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to look for each of these individuals in the table. The table has multiple rows, each representing a person with various details. Each row seems to have columns like \"Name\", \"Died\", etc.\n\nStarting with Jill Ireland: I'll go through the rows one by one. Scanning down, I don't see any entry where the name is Jill Ireland. Hmm, that's odd. Maybe she isn't listed here, or perhaps her name is misspelled? But as per the table given, there's no mention of her.\n\nNext, Judy Garland: Again, looking through each row, I can't find Judy Garland in the names provided. The closest I see is Shirley Temple and others, but not Judy Garland. So, based on this table, Judy Garland isn't listed either.\n\nThen, Walter Matthau: Let's check for him. Looking at each name, I don't immediately spot Walter Matthau. Wait, there's a row with \"Walter Matthau\" as one of the names? No, actually, looking closer, I see that one of the rows is about Gilda Radner and another mentions Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood. But no entry for Walter Matthau. \n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me check again. The table includes a variety of names like James Stewart, Shirley Temple, etc., but none seem to be Walter Matthau. So, based on the provided data, he isn't listed either.\n\nSince none of these three individuals\u2014Jill Ireland, Judy Garland, and Walter Matthau\u2014are present in the table, I can't verify their death years from this data.

Let's scan through each row:\n\nLooking at each row's \"Spouse Name\":\n\n- Row 17: Gloria Stuart married Arthur Sheekman. The death date is August 12, 1978 (Gloria died then), but her spouse Arthur Sheekman's death details aren't directly provided here.\n  \nWait, actually, looking more carefully:\n\nEach row represents a deceased person and their spouse. So the \"Name\" column is the person who died, and \"Spouse Name\" is their spouse.\n\nSo for example, in row 17: Gloria Stuart (Name) was married to Arthur Sheekman (Spouse Name). The death details are about Gloria, not her spouse.\n\nI need to find rows where either Arthur Sheekman or Charles Alden Black is the deceased person (i.e., their name is in the \"Name\" column).\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\n- Row 0: George C Scott died on September 22, 1999.

No mention of Mona Graham or Karl Malden. So perhaps this is a fictional entry not present in the table.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the rows.

Therefore, the claim's couple isn't present in the data provided. \n\nNow, checking for the longest marriage duration. The highest value I found is 68 years (rows 3 and 4).
