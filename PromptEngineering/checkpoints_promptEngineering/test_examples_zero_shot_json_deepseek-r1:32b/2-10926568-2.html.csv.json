    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"the title of the episode that aired on march 31, 2008 be, new york : secret societies.\" \n\nFirst, I should parse the claim properly. It seems like the user is saying that the episode which aired on March 31, 2008 has the title \"New York: Secret Societies.\"\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are production number, episode number, original airdate, episode title, and host. So I need to find the row where the original airdate is March 31, 2008.\n\nI'll go through each row's airdate:\n\n- Row 0: January 28, 2008\n- Row 1: February 4, 2008\n- Row 2: February 11, 2008\n- Row 3: February 25, 2008\n- Row 4: March 3, 2008\n- Row 5: March 10, 2008\n- Row 6: March 17, 2008\n- Row 7: March 24, 2008\n- Row 8: March 31, 2008\n- Then the rest are April and May.\n\nSo row index 8 has the airdate of March 31, 2008. Now I need to check what the episode title is for that row. The fourth column (index 4) in that row is \"new york : secret societies.\" \n\nThe claim matches exactly with this information. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Row 8, column 'original airdate' which confirms the date.\n- Row 8, column 'episode title' to confirm the title.\n\nThus, the answer should be TRUE with those two cells as relevant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"episode number 202 air on february 4, 2008.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to in the table. The table has columns: production no, episode no, original airdate, episode title, and host.\n\nLooking at the data, each row represents an episode with various details. I should search for the episode number 202 because that's a specific identifier mentioned in the claim.\n\nGoing through each row:\n- Row 1 (index 0) has production no 15 and episode no 201.\n- Row 2 (index 1) has production no 16 and episode no 202. So this is the relevant row because it's about episode number 202.\n\nNow, I need to check two things here: what was the airdate for episode 202? The column \"original airdate\" in this row says February 4, 2008. That matches exactly with the claim which states that the episode aired on February 4, 2008.\n\nSo both parts of the claim\u2014the episode number being 202 and it airing on February 4\u2014are supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately reflects the information in the table for episode number 202, which aired on February 4, 2008.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"episode no\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the title of the episode that air in january 28 , 2008 be vietnam host by don wildman.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the components of the claim:\n\n1. The date mentioned is January 28, 2008.\n2. The title of the episode on that date should be \"Vietnam.\"\n3. The host of that episode should be Don Wildman.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, I'll check each row to find the one with the airdate of January 28, 2008. Scanning through the data:\n\n- The first row has an original airdate of \"january 28 , 2008.\" That's a match for the date.\n- Now, checking the episode title in this row: it's listed as \"underground apocalypse.\"\n- The host is Don Wildman, which matches.\n\nWait, but the claim says the title should be \"Vietnam,\" which isn't what's in the table. Let me double-check other rows to ensure there isn't another entry with January 28, 2008 and a different title.\n\nLooking further down:\n\n- The second row has an airdate of February 4, 2008, titled \"Vietnam\" with Don Wildman as host.\n\nSo, the claim is mixing up two pieces: it's using the correct date (January 28) but incorrectly attributes the title to \"Vietnam,\" which actually aired on a different date. \n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are from row index 0 for the date and title, and row index 1 where \"Vietnam\" is the title with its respective date. Since the claim's title doesn't match the given date in the table, the statement is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"episode number 213 air on january 28, 2008\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that episode number 213 was aired on January 28, 2008. I need to check if this matches the information in the provided JSON table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: production no, episode no, original airdate, episode title, and host. The data is a list of rows, each representing an entry with these five pieces of information.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific pieces of information: episode number 213 and the airdate January 28, 2008. So I need to find if there's an entry in the table where episode no is 213 and original airdate is January 28, 2008.\n\nLet me start by searching for episode number 213 in the \"episode no\" column. Looking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: episode no 201\n- Row 1: 202\n- Row 2: 203\n- Row 3: 204\n- Row 4: 205\n- Row 5: 206\n- Row 6: 207\n- Row 7: 208\n- Row 8: 209\n- Row 9: 210\n- Row 10: 211\n- Row 11: 212\n- Row 12: 213\n\nSo, episode number 213 is in row index 12. Now, I need to check the original airdate for this episode. Looking at column \"original airdate\" for row 12, it's listed as \"may 5 , 2008\". \n\nWait a minute, that doesn't match January 28, 2008. The claim says January 28, but the table shows May 5 for episode 213. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me check if any other row has an original airdate of January 28, 2008. Looking at each row:\n\n- Row 0: \"january 28 , 2008\" \u2013 this is the airdate for episode no 201.\n\nSo, episode number 201 aired on January 28, 2008, not 213. Therefore, the claim that episode 213 aired on that date is incorrect.\n\nTo summarize: The claim associates episode 213 with January 28, 2008, but according to the table, episode 213 aired on May 5, 2008. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that episode number 213 aired on January 28, 2008. Checking the table, episode 213 (row index 12) has an airdate of May 5, 2008. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"episode no\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
