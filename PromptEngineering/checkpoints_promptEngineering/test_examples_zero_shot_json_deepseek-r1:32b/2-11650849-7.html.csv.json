    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this table in JSON format and a claim to verify. The claim is: \"on sunday, september 30, the chicago bear beat the green bay packer 31 - 20\". My task is to check if this is TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided.\n\nFirst, I'll need to parse the JSON structure correctly. The table has columns like year, date, winner, result, loser, attendance, and location. Each row under \"data\" corresponds to a specific game with these details.\n\nThe claim mentions three key pieces of information: the date (sunday, september 30), the winner (chicago bears), and the score (31-20). So I need to look for a row where all these conditions are met.\n\nLooking at the \"data\" array, each element is an array representing a game. Let's go through them one by one:\n\nRow 0: 1950, sunday october 1 \u2013 not our date.\nRow 1: 1950, sunday october 15 \u2013 nope.\nRow 2: 1951, sunday september 30. This matches the date in the claim. Now checking other details here.\n\nIn this row (row index 2), the winner is \"chicago bears\" and the result is \"31 - 20\", with the loser being \"green bay packers\". So all parts of the claim are satisfied here: correct date, correct winner, correct score.\n\nI should also check if there's another game on the same date in a different year, but looking through all rows, I don't see any other entries for september 30 except this one. All other games are either before or after that date.\n\nSo based on row index 2, the claim is supported. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the chicago bear be the loser against the green bay packer more than 10 times\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are year, date, winner, result, loser, attendance, and location. Each row represents a game between the Chicago Bears and the Green Bay Packers.\n\nThe claim states that the Chicago Bears lost to the Green Bay Packers more than 10 times. So, I need to count how many times the Bears were listed as the loser in these games.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\nRow 0: Winner is Green Bay, Loser is Chicago Bears \u2192 Counts.\nRow 1: Winner is Chicago, so they didn't lose \u2192 Doesn't count.\nRow 2: Winner is Chicago \u2192 No loss for them here.\nRow 3: Winner is Chicago \u2192 Again, no loss.\nRow 4: Winner is Chicago \u2192 Still not a loss for them.\nRow 5: Winner is Green Bay \u2192 Bears lost again. Count increases to 2.\nRow 6: Winner is Chicago \u2192 Not a loss.\nRow 7: It's a tie (21-21), so neither won nor lost \u2192 Doesn't count.\nRow 8: Winner is Chicago \u2192 No loss.\nRow 9: Winner is Chicago \u2192 Still no loss for them.\nRow 10: Winner is Green Bay \u2192 Bears lose. Count is now 3.\nRow 11: Winner is Chicago \u2192 Not a loss.\nRow 12: Winner is Chicago \u2192 No loss here either.\nRow 13: Winner is Chicago \u2192 Again, not a loss.\nRow 14: Winner is Green Bay \u2192 Bears lost again. Now at 4 losses.\nRow 15: Winner is Chicago \u2192 Not applicable.\nRow 16: Winner is Chicago \u2192 Still no loss.\nRow 17: Winner is Chicago \u2192 No loss here either.\nRow 18: Winner is Green Bay \u2192 Bears lose, count reaches 5.\nRow 19: Winner is Chicago \u2192 Doesn't add to the loss count.\n\nSo, counting all these instances where Chicago is the loser: rows 0,5,10,14,18. That's a total of 5 times. \n\nSince 5 is not more than 10, the claim isn't supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nI also need to list all relevant cells that were checked for this claim. Each row where Chicago was the loser has their respective 'row_index' and the 'column_name' as \"loser\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"loser\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"loser\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"loser\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"loser\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"loser\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
