    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"draft pick number 155 come from arizona university\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table to understand its structure. The columns are \"round\", \"pick\", \"player\", \"position\", and \"college\". Each row represents a draft pick with details about the player, their position, and where they went to college.\n\nThe claim is specifically about draft pick number 155. So, I need to find the row where the \"pick\" value is 155. Looking through the data:\n\n- Row indices start from 0. Let's check each row:\n  - Row 0: Pick 16\n  - Row 1: Pick 43\n  - Row 2: Pick 70\n  - Row 3: Pick 101\n  - Row 4: Pick 155 \u2192 This is the one we're looking for.\n\nNow, in row index 4, I need to check two things:\n1. The \"pick\" number should be 155.\n2. The \"college\" should be Arizona University.\n\nLooking at row 4:\n- \"pick\": 155 (matches)\n- \"college\": \"arizona\"\n\nSo, the player with pick number 155 is fromArizona University. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI need to note the relevant cells for this verification:\n- The \"pick\" column in row 4 to confirm it's 155.\n- The \"college\" column in the same row to check the university name.\n\nThus, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are row index 4 for both pick and college columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"arizona be the college who have the last draft pick\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim is saying. It states that Arizona is the college with the last draft pick. So, I need to find out which college corresponds to the highest (last) pick number in the table.\n\nLooking at the columns, we have \"round\", \"pick\", \"player\", \"position\", and \"college\". The key here is the \"pick\" column because that indicates the draft order\u2014higher numbers mean later picks.\n\nI'll go through each row's \"pick\" value to find the maximum. Let me list them out:\n\n1. Round 1, Pick 16\n2. Round 2, Pick 43\n3. Round 3, Pick 70\n4. Round 4, Pick 101\n5. Round 6, Pick 155\n6. Round 7, Pick 167\n7. Round 7, Pick 171\n8. Round 7, Pick 182\n9. Round 8, Pick 209\n10. Round 9, Pick 239\n11. Round 10, Pick 266\n12. Round 11, Pick 293\n\nThe highest pick number here is 293 in round 11. Now, checking the college for that pick: it's Al Edwards from Northwestern State, LA, not Arizona.\n\nWait a second\u2014that seems contradictory. Let me double-check to ensure I didn't make a mistake. The last row has the highest pick (293), but the college is Northwestern State, LA, not Arizona.\n\nHowever, looking back at other entries, Arizona appears in two places: row 3 with pick 70 and row 6 with pick 155. These are both earlier picks compared to 293.\n\nSo, the last draft pick (293) is from Northwestern State, LA, not Arizona. Therefore, the claim that Arizona has the last draft pick is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe highest \"pick\" number in the table is 293, which corresponds to Al Edwards from Northwestern State, LA, not Arizona.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
