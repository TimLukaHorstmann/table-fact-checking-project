    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"only 2 player score under par at the 1971 us open\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll examine the structure of the table. It has columns: place, player, country, score, and to par. Each row represents a different player's performance in the tournament.\n\nThe claim mentions that only two players scored under par. In golf, \"to par\" indicates how a player's total score compares to the standard par for the course. A negative number means they are under par (good), while a positive is over par (not as good).\n\nLooking at the \"to par\" column:\n\n1. Jim Simons: -3\n2. Jack Nicklaus: -1\n3. Bobby Nichols: e (which stands for even, neither under nor over)\n4. Lee Trevino: +1\n5. George Archer: +1\n6. Jim Colbert: +1\n7. Bob Erickson: +1\n8. Ken Still: +2\n9. Larry Hinson: +2\n10. Bruce Devlin: +2\n\nFrom this, the players with negative \"to par\" scores are Jim Simons and Jack Nicklaus. These two have -3 and -1 respectively, which means they scored under par.\n\nBobby Nichols is at even par (e), so he's not under. The rest are over par.\n\nTherefore, only two players have scores under par as per the table. This aligns with the claim made.\n\nTo support this, I'll identify the relevant cells in the table:\n\n- Jim Simons' \"to par\" cell (row 0)\n- Jack Nicklaus' \"to par\" cell (row 1)\n\nThese are the only two players who scored under par, confirming that the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has given me a table in JSON format and a specific claim to verify. My task is to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the table to understand its structure. It looks like it's a golf tournament result with columns: place, player, country, score, and \"to par\". There are ten rows of data representing different players' performances.\n\nThe claim is: \"the top golfer defeat the player tie for eighth by 5 stroke.\" I need to break this down into parts to verify each condition.\n\nStarting with identifying the top golfer. In golf tournaments, lower scores typically indicate better performance. Looking at the 'score' column, Jim Simons (row 0) has a total score of 207, which is the lowest among all players. So, he's definitely the top golfer.\n\nNext, I need to find who is tied for eighth place. The table shows that t8 is listed in the 'place' column for three players: Ken Still (row 7), Larry Hinson (row 8), and Bruce Devlin (row 9). Each of these players has a score of 212.\n\nNow, I need to check if the top golfer's score is five strokes better than those tied for eighth. Jim Simons' total is 207, and the t8 players have 212 each. The difference between 207 and 212 is exactly 5 strokes. So, this part of the claim holds true.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other relevant cells that might affect this conclusion. For Jim Simons, I looked at his score (row 0, 'score'). For the t8 players, their scores are in rows 7, 8, and 9 under the 'score' column. Additionally, checking the 'to par' column could provide more context on their performance relative to par, but since the claim specifically mentions the stroke difference between the top golfer and those tied for eighth, the score differences alone suffice.\n\nI need to make sure that there are no other players with a better score than Jim Simons, which could affect his status as the top golfer. Scanning through all rows, Jim's 207 is indeed the best score, so he remains the top player.\n\nConsidering possible edge cases: what if there were multiple top golfers? Looking at the table, row 1 has Jack Nicklaus with a total of 209, which is worse than 207. So, Jim Simons stands alone as the leader.\n\nAlso, verifying that all t8 players are indeed tied for eighth and not part of another tie further down. The 'place' column shows t4 (rows 3-6) before t8 starts at row 7. So, rows 7-9 are correctly identified as tied for eighth place.\n\nAnother consideration: sometimes in golf, a player's score can be compared by their position relative to par, but since the claim specifically mentions strokes, I'm focusing on the total scores rather than 'to par' values.\n\nPutting it all together: The top golfer (Jim Simons) has a 5-stroke lead over those tied for eighth place. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"3 player score better on the first round than the eventual winner\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, let's understand the table structure. The columns are place, player, country, score, and to par. Each row represents a player's performance in the tournament.\n\nThe claim mentions that three players scored better on the first round than the eventual winner. So, I need to identify who the eventual winner is and then check if at least three players had a better (lower) score in their first round compared to the winner's first round.\n\nLooking at the \"place\" column, the top position is \"1\", which is Jim Simons (a) from the United States. His total score is 71 + 71 + 65 = 207 with a to par of -3. Since he is in 1st place, he is the eventual winner.\n\nNext, I'll look at each player's first round score. The \"score\" column shows three numbers separated by plus signs, representing each round. For example, Jim Simons' scores are 71, 71, and 65. So his first round score is 71.\n\nNow, I need to check how many players have a first-round score lower than 71. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. Jim Simons (a) - 71\n2. Jack Nicklaus - 69\n3. Bobby Nichols - 69\n4. Lee Trevino - 70\n5. George Archer - 71\n6. Jim Colbert - 69\n7. Bob Erickson - 71\n8. Ken Still - 71\n9. Larry Hinson - 71\n10. Bruce Devlin - 72\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here. The first round score is the first number in each player's score. Let me correct that:\n\n- Jim Simons: 71\n- Jack Nicklaus: 69\n- Bobby Nichols: 69\n- Lee Trevino: 70\n- George Archer: 71\n- Jim Colbert: 69\n- Bob Erickson: 71\n- Ken Still: 71\n- Larry Hinson: 71\n- Bruce Devlin: 72\n\nNow, comparing each player's first round to the winner's 71:\n\n- Jack Nicklaus: 69 < 71 \u2192 better\n- Bobby Nichols: 69 < 71 \u2192 better\n- Lee Trevino: 70 < 71 \u2192 better\n- Jim Colbert: 69 < 71 \u2192 better\n\nWait, that's four players with a first-round score better than the winner. But the claim says three players. Hmm, maybe I miscounted.\n\nLet me list all players and their first round scores:\n\n1. Jim Simons (a): 71\n2. Jack Nicklaus: 69\n3. Bobby Nichols: 69\n4. Lee Trevino: 70\n5. George Archer: 71\n6. Jim Colbert: 69\n7. Bob Erickson: 71\n8. Ken Still: 71\n9. Larry Hinson: 71\n10. Bruce Devlin: 72\n\nSo, players with first round <71:\n\n- Jack Nicklaus (69)\n- Bobby Nichols (69)\n- Lee Trevino (70)\n- Jim Colbert (69)\n\nThat's four players. The claim says three, so perhaps the correct count is three, or maybe I'm misinterpreting \"eventual winner.\" Wait, the eventual winner is in first place, which is Jim Simons with 207 total. So his first round was 71.\n\nLooking at all players except the winner:\n\n- Jack Nicklaus: 69 (better)\n- Bobby Nichols: 69 (better)\n- Lee Trevino: 70 (better)\n- George Archer: 71 (same)\n- Jim Colbert: 69 (better)\n- Bob Erickson: 71 (same)\n- Ken Still: 71 (same)\n- Larry Hinson: 71 (same)\n- Bruce Devlin: 72 (worse)\n\nSo, excluding the winner, how many have a first round better than 71? That's Jack Nicklaus, Bobby Nichols, Lee Trevino, and Jim Colbert. That's four players.\n\nBut the claim says three players scored better. So perhaps I made an error in counting. Let me recount:\n\nPlayers with first round <71 (i.e., better):\n\n- Row index 1: Jack Nicklaus (69)\n- Row index 2: Bobby Nichols (69)\n- Row index 3: Lee Trevino (70)\n- Row index 5: Jim Colbert (69)\n\nThat's four players. So the claim says three, but according to this, it's four. Therefore, is the claim TRUE or FALSE? The claim states \"3 player score better,\" so if there are actually four, then the claim is FALSE because it doesn't specify exactly three.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the claim. It says \"3 player score better on the first round than the eventual winner.\" So maybe only three of them are correct in the data. Let me check again:\n\n- Row 1: Jack Nicklaus (69) - better\n- Row 2: Bobby Nichols (69) - better\n- Row 3: Lee Trevino (70) - better\n- Row 5: Jim Colbert (69) - better\n\nThat's four players. So the claim is FALSE because it's more than three.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"score better.\" If the player has a lower score in the first round, that's better. But perhaps some have lower scores but higher totals? No, because the winner has 207, and others may have higher or lower total scores.\n\nWait, no\u2014only the first-round score is being considered here. So regardless of their total, if their first-round was lower than 71, they are better in that round.\n\nSo, four players: Jack Nicklaus (row 1), Bobby Nichols (row 2), Lee Trevino (row3), Jim Colbert (row5). That's four rows with first-round scores better than the winner. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because it's not three but four.\n\nBut maybe I should consider only those who ended up in the top positions? No, the claim doesn't specify that; it just says any players.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe Bruce Devlin (row9) has a higher first-round score than 71, so he's worse. Others are same or better. So total is four.\n\nThus, since the claim states three players, but in reality, there are four, the answer should be that it's FALSE.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in considering \"eventual winner.\" The eventual winner is first place, so all others are not. But regardless, their first-round scores can still be better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only three of them have lower than 71 in the first round? Let me recount:\n\nLooking at each row's first score:\n\nRow0: 71 (winner)\nRow1:69\nRow2:69\nRow3:70\nRow4:71\nRow5:69\nRow6:71\nRow7:71\nRow8:71\nRow9:72\n\nSo, first scores:\n\nLess than 71: rows 1 (69), 2 (69), 3 (70), and 5 (69). That's four players. So the claim is FALSE.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the claim is incorrect because there are four players with better first-round scores than the winner.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the statement \"Three players scored better on the first round than the eventual winner\" is true or false, we need to compare each player's first-round score against the eventual winner's first-round score.\n\n1. **Identify the Eventual Winner:**\n   - The eventual winner is in 1st place with a total score of 207 and a first-round score of 71.\n\n2. **Compare Each Player's First-Round Score to the Winner's First-Round Score (71):**\n   - Players who scored lower than 71 in the first round have a better score.\n   - The players with first-round scores lower than 71 are:\n     - Row1: Jack Nicklaus (69)\n     - Row2: Bobby Nichols (69)\n     - Row3: Lee Trevino (70)\n     - Row5: Jim Colbert (69)\n\n3. **Count the Number of Players with Better First-Round Scores:**\n   - There are four players who scored better on the first round than the eventual winner.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The statement claims three players, but in reality, there are four.\n   - Therefore, the statement is false.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{False}}$",

I need to determine if the claim \"on the third round, jim simons outplayed jack nicklaus by 3 strokes\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll locate Jim Simons and Jack Nicklaus in the data. Looking at the \"player\" column:\n\n- Jim Simons (A) is in row 0.\n- Jack Nicklaus is in row 1.\n\nNext, I need to look at their scores specifically for the third round. The scores are listed as three numbers separated by pluses, each representing a round's score.\n\nFor Jim Simons:\nHis score is \"71 + 71 + 65 = 207\". So, his third-round score is 65.\n\nFor Jack Nicklaus:\nHis score is \"69 + 72 + 68 = 209\". His third-round score is 68.\n\nNow, to find out the difference in their third-round scores. Jim scored 65 and Jack scored 68. The difference is 68 - 65 = 3 strokes. So, Jim did indeed outplay Jack by 3 strokes in the third round.\n\nI'll need to note which cells are relevant:\n\n- For Jim Simons: row index 0, column \"score\".\n- For Jack Nicklaus: row index 1, column \"score\".\n\nThese cells contain their respective scores from each round.

It lists the standings of various golfers in a tournament, possibly the 1971 US Open as mentioned in the claim. The columns are place, player, country, score, and to par.\n\nThe key here is to focus on the \"to par\" column because that indicates whether each player's score was under par (negative), exactly par (\"e\"), or over par (positive). Under par means the player performed better than the course's par.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\n1. Jim Simons (a) has a \"to par\" of \"-3\", which is under par.\n2. Jack Nicklaus has a \"to par\" of \"-1\", also under par.\n3. Bobby Nichols is exactly at par (\"e\"), so not under.\n4. Lee Trevino, George Archer, Jim Colbert, Bob Erickson are all \"+1\" or higher, meaning over par.\n5. Ken Still and Larry Hinson are \"+2\", over par.\n6.

    "claim": "only 3 golfer score under par on 2 separate round",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"only 3 golfers scored under par on 2 separate rounds\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table structure. The columns are: place, player, country, score, and to par. Each row represents a golfer's performance in three rounds with their total score and how they compare to par (to par column).\n\nThe claim says that only 3 golfers have scores under par on two separate rounds. So, I need to check each golfer's individual round scores and see if any of them had under par in at least two of the three rounds.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Jim Simons: His score is 71 + 71 + 65 = 207. The 'to par' is -3, which means overall he's under par by 3 strokes. But looking at individual rounds, all three rounds are above or equal to the specified \"under par\" in each round? Wait, actually, the claim isn't about their total being under par but about each of two separate rounds. So I need to check if any golfer had two rounds where their score was under par.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The 'to par' column shows the overall performance relative to par for the entire tournament, not per round. Therefore, each player's individual round scores might be under or over par in each round, but the table only provides the total.\n\nHmm, this complicates things because without knowing the par for each round, I can't directly determine if a specific round was under par. However, the 'to par' column shows how they ended up overall. For example, Jim Simons is -3, meaning his total score is 3 below par. But that doesn't necessarily mean he had two rounds under par.\n\nWait, maybe the scores per round are given as \"71 + 71 + 65 = 207\". If I assume that each round's par is a certain number (commonly around 72), then any score below 72 would be under par for that round. Let's assume that.\n\nSo, let's check each golfer:\n\n- Jim Simons: Rounds are 71, 71, 65. All three rounds are under 72, so all three rounds are under par. So he has more than two rounds under par.\n- Jack Nicklaus: Scores 69, 72, 68. Wait, 69 is under 72 (assuming par is 72), 72 is exactly par, and 68 is also under. So two rounds under par (69 and 68). But wait, the scores are listed as \"69 + 72 + 68 = 209\". So that's two under and one at par.\n- Bobby Nichols: 69 + 72 + 69 = 210. Two rounds under (69) and one at par (72). So he has two under.\n- Lee Trevino: Scores are 70, 72, 69. 70 is under, 72 is par, 69 is under. So two under.\n- George Archer: 71 +70 +70 = 211. Each round's score is above 70 but if par is 72, then all are under (since 71 and 70 are below 72). Wait, that can't be right because 'to par' for George is +1. So his total is 211, which is over par by one stroke. That suggests that each round's score adds up to being over par overall.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify:\n\nIf each round has a par of, say, 72 (common for many golf courses), then any score below 72 is under par for that round. But the 'to par' column shows how their total compares to the total par over three rounds (which would be 3*72=216). So if a golfer's total is, say, 207, they're 9 strokes under par overall (-9), but each individual round could vary.\n\nHowever, in our case, we don't have per-round par information. The 'to par' column only reflects the cumulative result.\n\nBut for the claim, it's about two separate rounds being under par. So perhaps I should consider that if a golfer's total is under par overall, they might have had multiple rounds under par.\n\nWait, but let me approach this differently. Since each round's score is given (e.g., 71 + 71 + 65), and assuming par per round is 72, I can count how many of their individual rounds were under 72.\n\nLet's do that for each golfer:\n\n- Jim Simons: All three scores are below 72. So all three rounds under par.\n- Jack Nicklaus: Scores 69, 72, 68. 69 and 68 are under 72; one round at par. So two under.\n- Bobby Nichols: 69, 72, 69. Two under, one at par. So two under.\n- Lee Trevino: 70, 72, 69. Two under (70 and 69), one at par. So two under.\n- George Archer: 71, 70, 70. All three rounds are below 72. Wait, but his total is +1, which seems contradictory. If each round was 71, 70, 70 (summing to 211), and the par for three rounds would be 216 (3*72=216). So 211 is 5 under. But his 'to par' is +1. Hmm, this doesn't add up.\n\nWait a minute, there must be something wrong here. If George Archer's total is 211 and the total par is 216, he should be -5, not +1. So perhaps my assumption about the individual rounds being under or over is incorrect because I don't know each round's actual par.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'to par' column refers to how they performed relative to another player or a different standard. This complicates things because without knowing per-round par, I can't accurately determine if two of their rounds were under par.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the 'to par' column shows their overall performance. So if a golfer's total is under par, they must have had more rounds under par than over. But the claim is specifically about having two separate rounds where each was under par, not necessarily the total.\n\nHowever, without knowing per-round par, it's impossible to determine exactly how many rounds were under or over. Therefore, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the golfer ended up with an overall score that is under par by a certain amount, and from their total, we can infer that they must have had at least two rounds under par.\n\nBut in the absence of per-round par information, it's speculative. However, considering the scores provided:\n\n- Jim Simons: All three scores below 72 (assuming par is 72). So definitely three under.\n- Jack Nicklaus: Two under, one at par (if 69 and 68 are under).\n- Bobby Nichols: Two under.\n- Lee Trevino: Two under.\n- George Archer: If his total is +1, but individual scores are all below 72, that's a contradiction unless the actual par per round was higher.\n\nWait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should consider that each golfer who has a 'to par' less than or equal to -2 (or some threshold) would have had two rounds under par. But without exact numbers, it's difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that any golfer with an overall score under par must have had at least one round under par, but not necessarily two.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: \"You are tasked with determining how many golfers in a tournament had exactly two of their three rounds under par.\" But in our data, we don't know each round's par, only the total 'to par'.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the answer is that it's impossible to determine based on the given information. However, if I have to proceed with assumptions, perhaps assuming that a golfer's overall performance indicates their individual rounds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is structured so that we can deduce based on the total 'to par' and the sum of scores whether they had two under-par rounds.\n\nLet me attempt this:\n\nFor each golfer, let\u2019s denote:\n- Let S1, S2, S3 be their scores in each round.\n- Total score T = S1 + S2 + S3\n- Par per round is P (unknown), so total par for three rounds is 3P.\n\nGiven that the 'to par' is (T - 3P). If we can find how many golfers have exactly two Si < P.\n\nBut without knowing P or T, it's impossible. Therefore, perhaps the answer is that we cannot determine this from the given data.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The total score and 'to par' give us T - 3P = (T - 3P). So if a golfer has T1 - 3P = X and another has T2 - 3P = Y, etc. But without knowing P or individual S's beyond the sum, it's impossible to know how many rounds were under par.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is that we cannot determine the number of golfers who had exactly two rounds under par from the given information.\n</think>\n\nIt is impossible to determine how many golfers had exactly two of their three rounds under par based on the provided data because the individual round scores relative to par are not specified. Without knowing each round's actual par, we cannot conclusively determine if exactly two rounds were under par for any golfer.\n\n**Answer:** It is impossible to determine with the given information.",

    "claim": "more than 4 player score better on the first round than the eventual winner",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"more than 4 players scored better on the first round than the eventual winner\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim means. The term \"scored better on the first round\" refers to a player having a lower score in their first round compared to another player's first round score. In golf, a lower score is better because it means fewer strokes taken. So, if someone scores lower than the eventual winner in the first round, they scored better.\n\nNext, I need to identify who the eventual winner is. Looking at the table, the places are listed starting from 1. The first row has \"place\" as \"1\", so that must be the winner. The player there is Jim Simons (a) from the United States with a total score of 207.\n\nNow, I need to extract each player's first round score. Each player's \"score\" column shows their three rounds added together. For example, Jim Simons has \"71 + 71 + 65 = 207\". So the first number is his first-round score, which is 71.\n\nLet me list out each player and their first-round scores:\n\n1. Jim Simons (a) - 71\n2. Jack Nicklaus - 69\n3. Bobby Nichols - 69\n4. Lee Trevino - 70\n5. George Archer - 71\n6. Jim Colbert - 69\n7. Bob Erickson - 71\n8. Ken Still - 71\n9. Larry Hinson - 71\n10. Bruce Devlin - 72\n\nWait, but I think the claim is about who scored better than the winner in the first round. So, any player with a first-round score lower than Jim Simons' first-round score of 71 would have scored better.\n\nLooking at the scores:\n\n- Jack Nicklaus: 69 (better)\n- Bobby Nichols: 69 (better)\n- Lee Trevino: 70 (better)\n- George Archer: 71 (same as winner, not better)\n- Jim Colbert: 69 (better)\n- Bob Erickson: 71 (same)\n- Ken Still: 71 (same)\n- Larry Hinson: 71 (same)\n- Bruce Devlin: 72 (worse)\n\nSo the players who scored better in the first round than Jim Simons are Jack Nicklaus, Bobby Nichols, Lee Trevino, and Jim Colbert. That's four players.\n\nThe claim says \"more than 4\" players. Since there are exactly 4 players who scored better, it doesn't meet the \"more than\" condition. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to map this back to the table's relevant cells. The \"score\" column contains each player's three rounds and total. For each player, the first number in their score string is their first-round score. So for each row, we look at the \"score\" cell and extract the first value.\n\nRelevant rows are all players except maybe the winner, but to confirm who is the winner, we check his position (row 0). Then, for each player's score, we extract their first round from the data in the \"score\" column. Therefore, all the cells under the \"score\" column across all rows are relevant because they contain the necessary information to evaluate each player's first-round performance relative to the winner.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells would include every row's \"score\" cell.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "more than 3 golfer score under par on 3 separate round",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"more than 3 golfer score under par on 3 separate round\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim and see how it applies.\n\nFirst, understanding the claim: It says that more than three golfers have scores under par in each of three separate rounds. So, for each golfer, I need to check if their score in each round was under par, and whether this happened across three different rounds.\n\nLooking at the table columns: We have \"place,\" \"player,\" \"country,\" \"score,\" and \"to par.\" The \"to par\" column shows how much each player is under or over par. So, a negative number means they are under par, which is good.\n\nI'll go through each row to see who has scores under par in all three rounds. Let's look at the \"score\" column for each player. The score format is like \"71 + 72 + 68 = 209\". Each number before the plus signs represents a round's score.\n\nWait, but does the \"to par\" indicate overall or per round? Hmm, actually, in golf tournaments, typically the \"to par\" refers to the total over all rounds. So, for example, Jim Simons has \"-3\", which means his total is 3 under par. But that doesn't necessarily mean each round was under par.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"on 3 separate round,\" which probably means in each of three different rounds, not necessarily each round they played. Maybe it's about having at least one score under par across multiple rounds, but I'm not sure. Let me clarify: The phrase might mean that each golfer has under par in all three rounds (each individual round) and we need more than three such golfers.\n\nWait, the exact wording is \"score under par on 3 separate round.\" Hmm. It could be interpreted as each golfer having at least one score under par across three different rounds, but that doesn't make much sense because in a tournament, players typically play the same number of rounds. Alternatively, it might mean each golfer has all three rounds under par.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider whether each of their individual round scores were under par. But looking at the \"score\" column: Each player's total is given as sum of three rounds. The \"to par\" is overall, not per round. So without knowing the par for each round, we can't determine if each individual round was under par.\n\nBut perhaps the claim refers to their total being under par across all three rounds, but that would just be the total score. Let me check the \"to par\" column again:\n\n- Jim Simons: -3 (total under)\n- Jack Nicklaus: -1\n- Bobby Nichols: E (even)\n- Lee Trevino: +1\n- George Archer: +1\n- Jim Colbert: +1\n- Bob Erickson: +1\n- Ken Still: +2\n- Larry Hinson: +2\n- Bruce Devlin: +2\n\nSo, only Simons and Nicklaus have overall under par. The claim is about more than three golfers having scores under par in each of three separate rounds. But according to the table, only two players (Simons and Nicklaus) are under par overall.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Maybe it's not that each golfer had all three rounds under par, but rather that across the tournament, more than three golfers had at least one round under par in different rounds.\n\nBut looking at the data, we can't see individual round scores\u2014only totals. So without knowing each round's score relative to par, we can't confirm if any golfer had all three rounds under or even how many separate times a golfer was under in different rounds.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is about having more than three players who scored under par in at least one of the three rounds across the tournament. But again, without individual round data, it's impossible to tell. The \"to par\" column only shows the overall result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to each player having a total score under par and we need more than three such players. In that case, only Simons (-3) and Nicklaus (-1) are under par, so that would be two, which is not more than three. Hence, the answer would be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting \"on 3 separate round.\" Maybe it means each golfer had their scores in three different rounds (i.e., each of their three rounds was under par). Since the table doesn't provide individual round data relative to par, we can't verify this. So without that information, we can't confirm if any player had all three rounds under par.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"on 3 separate round\" refers to more than three golfers having at least one round under par in different tournaments or different times, but the table seems to be about a single tournament.\n\nGiven the ambiguity and the lack of per-round data relative to par, it's impossible to confirm the claim. However, based on the \"to par\" column, only two players are under overall, which is less than three. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that only two golfers (Jim Simons and Jack Nicklaus) have scores under par in total. The claim requires more than three such golfers across each of three separate rounds, but without per-round data, it's impossible to confirm. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
