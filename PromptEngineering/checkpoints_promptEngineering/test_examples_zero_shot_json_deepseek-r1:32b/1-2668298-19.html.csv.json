    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"unless they retire, every incumbent north carolina us house representative be re-elect in 1822\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It states that unless an incumbent representative retires, they will be re-elected in 1822. So, for each row in the table (which represents a district and its representative), I need to check two things: whether the incumbent retired or not, and what the election result was.\n\nLooking at the columns in the table, the relevant ones are \"incumbent\", \"result\", and perhaps \"candidates\". The \"result\" column will indicate if they were re-elected, retired, or if there was a hold. \n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: District NC2, Incumbent Hutchins G Burton. Result is \"re-elected\". So he didn't retire and was re-elected.\n2. **Row 1**: District NC4, Incumbent William S Blackledge. Result is \"retired democratic-republican hold\". Here, the incumbent retired. The claim says if they don't retire, they get re-elected. Since he retired, it doesn't affect the claim's condition.\n3. **Row 2**: District NC5, Incumbent Charles Hooks. Result is \"re-elected\".\n4. **Row 3**: District NC6, Incumbent Weldon N Edwards. Result is \"re-elected\".\n5. **Row 4**: District NC7, Incumbent Archibald McNeill. Result is \"retired federalist hold\". He retired.\n6. **Row 5**: District NC9, Incumbent Romulus M Saunders. Result is \"re-elected\".\n7. **Row 6**: District NC10, Incumbent John Long. Result is \"re-elected\".\n\nNow, I need to check if all incumbents who did not retire were re-elected. From the above:\n\n- Incumbents in rows 0,2,3,5,6: All results are \"re-elected\" and none retired.\n- Incumbents in rows 1 and 4: They retired, so the claim doesn't require anything about their election outcome.\n\nSince all non-retiring incumbents were re-elected, the claim holds. Therefore, the answer is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

A party flip would mean that a different party won the seat compared to the previous election.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: district, incumbent, party, first elected, result, and candidates.

No flip here.\n2. **Row 1**: District 4, result is \"retired democratic - republican hold\". The incumbent retired, but the party held the seat, so no flip.\n3. **Row 2**: District 5, result is \"re - elected\".

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the majority of north carolina house representative in 1822 be democrat - republican\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It states that in 1822, the majority (more than half) of the North Carolina House representatives were from the Democratic-Republican party. To verify this, I need to look at each representative's information in the table and see which ones were elected or serving around 1822.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: district, incumbent, party, first elected, result, candidates. Each row represents a different district in North Carolina with details about their representatives.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: District NC-2, Incumbent Hutchins G Burton, Party Democratic-Republican, First elected 1819, Result Re-elected, Candidates include him and Jesse A Dawson.\n   - Since he was first elected in 1819 and re-elected, it's likely he was serving in 1822. His party is listed as Democratic-Republican.\n\n2. **Row 1**: District NC-4, Incumbent William S Blackledge, Party Democratic-Republican, First elected 1821, Result Retired, but the seat held by his party.\n   - He retired in 1822? The result says \"retired democratic-republican hold\", which might mean that someone else from the same party won. But the candidate is Richard Dobbs Spaight Jr., also DR. So NC-4 had a Democratic-Republican representative.\n\n3. **Row 2**: District NC-5, Incumbent Charles Hooks, Party DR, First elected in 1816 (special) and 1819. Result Re-elected.\n   - He was re-elected, so definitely serving in 1822 as a DR.\n\n4. **Row 3**: District NC-6, Incumbent Weldon N Edwards, Party DR, First elected in 1816 (special). Result Re-elected with 100% vote.\n   - He was re-elected, so he's serving in 1822 as a DR.\n\n5. **Row 4**: District NC-7, Incumbent Archibald McNeill, Party Federalist, First elected 1821. Result Retired, but the seat went to John Culpepper (Federalist) with 50.9% and Alexander McNeill with 49.1%. Wait, no\u2014the result says \"retired federalist hold\". But looking at candidates: John Culpepper (F) got 50.9%, so he won. So the representative is Federalist.\n\n6. **Row 5**: District NC-9, Incumbent Romulus M Saunders, Party DR, First elected 1821, Re-elected with 100%.\n   - Serving in 1822 as a DR.\n\n7. **Row 6**: District NC-10, Incumbent John Long, Party DR, First elected 1821, Re-elected with 66.9% against John McClelland (33.1%). So he's the representative in 1822 as a DR.\n\nNow, let me count how many districts are represented by each party:\n\n- Democratic-Republican: Rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 \u2192 That's 6 representatives.\n- Federalist: Row 4 \u2192 1 representative.\n\nSo out of 7 districts listed, 6 are DR and 1 is Federalist. Therefore, the majority (more than half) are indeed Democratic-Republicans in 1822.\n\nI need to make sure that all these incumbents were serving in 1822. The \"first elected\" years vary, but since they were either re-elected or their party held the seat upon retirement, it's reasonable to conclude they were serving around 1822.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"party\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It states that only two representatives from North Carolina in 1822 were Democrat-Republicans. I should check each row to see if they align with this statement.\n\nLooking at the table, there are seven entries for different districts of North Carolina. Each entry includes details like district name, incumbent, party, year elected, result, and candidates.\n\nI need to find out which representatives were in office during 1822. The \"first elected\" column shows the years they were first elected. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. District 2: Incumbent Hutchins G Burton was first elected in 1819. Since he was re-elected, his term would have extended into 1822.\n2. District 4: William S Blackledge retired, so there's no representative from this district in 1822.\n3. District 5: Charles Hooks was first elected in 1816 (special) and 1819. He was re-elected, so he would still be a rep in 1822.\n4. District 6: Weldon N Edwards was first elected in 1816 (special). Re-elected means his term continued into 1822.\n5. District 7: Archibald McNeill retired as a Federalist, so no one from this district is in office in 1822 under the Democrat-Republican party.\n6. District 9: Romulus M Saunders was first elected in 1821 and re-elected, so he's still a rep in 1822.\n7. District 10: John Long was elected in 1821 and re-elected, so he's also a rep in 1822.\n\nNow, counting the Democrat-Republicans serving in 1822:\n- District 2: Yes\n- District 5: Yes\n- District 6: Yes\n- District 9: Yes\n- District 10: Yes\n\nThat makes five representatives from the Democrat-Republican party.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"every incumbent of the north carolina us house of representative in the year 1822 lose their re-election campaign.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The key points are:\n- Incumbent: someone who currently holds a political office.\n- North Carolina US House Representatives: specific to this state's representatives in the U.S. Congress.\n- Year 1822: the time frame we're looking at.\n- Lose re-election campaign: they didn't get re-elected that year.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a district with information about the incumbent, party, when they were first elected, the result of their election, and candidates. \n\nI need to check for incumbents from North Carolina in 1822. But wait, the \"first elected\" column has years like 1819, 1821, etc., but not 1822. The claim is about 1822, so I should look at the year they were re-elected or if their election result in 1822 is mentioned.\n\nLooking through each row:\n- Row 0: District 2, elected in 1819, result \"re-elected.\" But does this mean they were up for re-election in 1822? The data might be about the result of their election. If it's 1819 as first elected and then re-elected, but without specific years for each election term, I'm not sure if 1822 is covered here.\n- Row 1: District 4, retired in 1821, so not relevant to 1822.\n- Rows 2,3,5,6: All have \"re-elected\" as their result. The exact year isn't specified beyond the first elected year, which is before 1822. So if they were re-elected in subsequent years, but without knowing exactly when, it's hard to tell if 1822 was a re-election year.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The claim is about the year 1822, so perhaps I should look for any incumbents elected or re-elected that specific year. But none of the rows have \"first elected\" as 1822. All are earlier years. So if all incumbents in 1822 were not present in this table because their terms started before, but we don't know what happened in 1822.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The table might list all the elections up to a certain point, and the claim is about whether any of these incumbents lost in 1822. But since none of them have a result that indicates they were defeated in 1822, but all are either re-elected or retired with their party holding the seat.\n\nWait, looking again, the \"result\" column for Row 0 is \"re-elected,\" which might mean they successfully ran again. So if someone was re-elected, they didn't lose. The claim says every incumbent lost, so if even one incumbent won, the claim is false.\n\nMoreover, in row 1, William S Blackledge retired, but the result shows \"retired Democratic-Republican hold,\" meaning his party kept the seat, implying he wasn't up for re-election that year or was replaced by someone else from the same party. So it's possible that in 1822, some incumbents were not running again, and others successfully retained their seats.\n\nSo since there are incumbents who were re-elected (like row 0,3,5,6) and at least one retired without losing (row1), the claim that every incumbent lost is false. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that every North Carolina US House representative incumbent in 1822 lost their re-election campaign. Reviewing the table, incumbents such as Hutchins G Burton and others were re-elected or retired without losing. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

A party flip would mean that the incumbent (the current holder) was from one party, and after the election, the new representative is from another party.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it's structured with columns: district, incumbent, party, first elected, result, candidates. The data has seven rows, each representing a different district in North Carolina. \n\nI need to check each row to see if there was a party flip. A party flip occurs when the incumbent's party is different from the winning candidate's party in that election.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0 (District 2):**\n   - Incumbent: Hutchins G Burton, Party: Democratic-Republican\n   - Result: Re-elected\n   So, since it says \"re-elected,\" there was no change in party. The same party held the seat.\n\n2. **Row 1 (District 4):**\n   - Incumbent: William S Blackledge, Party: Democratic-Republican\n   - Result: Retired; the result column mentions \"democratic-republican hold\" and the candidate is Richard Dobbs Spaight, Jr., also Democratic-Republican.\n   So, even though the incumbent retired, the party remained the same. No flip.\n\n3. **Row 2 (District 5):**\n   - Incumbent: Charles Hooks, Party: Democratic-Republican\n   - Result: Re-elected\n   Same as above, no change in party.\n\n4. **Row 3 (District 6):**\n   - Incumbent: Weldon N Edwards, Party: Democratic-Republican\n   - Result: Re-elected\n   No flip here either.\n\n5. **Row 4 (District 7):**\n   - Incumbent: Archibald McNeill, Party: Federalist\n   - Result: Retired; the result is \"retired federalist hold.\" The candidates are John Culpepper (Federalist) and Alexander McNeill (no party mentioned in the name). Wait, let me check the candidates string: \"john culpepper (a - f) 50.9% alexander mcneill 49.1%\" So, John Culpepper is with a minor party or affiliate? Or maybe the 'f' stands for Federalist?\n   Hmm, but the incumbent was a Federalist and retired. The winner seems to be John Culpepper, also a Federalist since it's (a - f). Wait, \"a\" might stand for affiliate? So perhaps he is also Federalist. If that's the case, then no party flip occurred because the seat stayed with the Federalist party.\n\n6. **Row 5 (District 9):**\n   - Incumbent: Romulus M Saunders, Party: Democratic-Republican\n   - Result: Re-elected\n   So same party, no flip.\n\n7. **Row 6 (District 10):**\n   - Incumbent: John Long, Party: Democratic-Republican\n   - Result: Re-elected\n   Again, same party; no flip.\n\nWait a minute, I didn't see any row where the incumbent's party was different from the winner's party. All incumbents were either re-elected or retired within their own party without changing hands to another party. So none of the districts experienced a party flip in 1822 according to this table.\n\nSince there are seven districts listed, half would be 3.5. Since we can't have half a district, maybe the claim is that three out of six had flips? But even if I consider all rows as part of the 1822 election (maybe some are from other years), let me check the \"first elected\" column to ensure these are from 1822.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 0: first elected in 1819\n- Row 1: 1821\n- Row 2: 1816 and 1819\n- Row 3: 1816 (special)\n- Row 4: 1821\n- Row 5: 1821\n- Row 6: 1821\n\nSo, the \"first elected\" years are either 1819 or earlier. But the claim is about the 1822 election. The table might be showing information for the 1822 elections because the 'result' and 'candidates' seem to pertain to that specific year's election outcome.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to confirm if all these entries are indeed from the 1822 elections. The claim is about the 1822 House of Representatives elections in North Carolina. So, perhaps each row represents a district in the 1822 election. If that's the case, then all seven rows are part of that year.\n\nBut looking at the 'result' column for each:\n\n- All except District 7 have results as \"re-elected\" or \"retired [party] hold,\" which indicates the same party retained the seat.\n- In District 7, Archibald McNeill (Federalist) retired, but John Culpepper won. The candidate list shows both with Federalist affiliation? Or is there a different interpretation?\n\nWait, in row 4, the candidates are \"john culpepper (a - f) 50.9% alexander mcneill 49.1%\". So 'culpepper' has (a - f), which might mean he's an affiliate of the Federalist party. If so, then even though the incumbent retired, the seat was taken by another Federalist. Therefore, no flip.\n\nSo in all seven districts, there were no party flips. Thus, zero out of seven had a party change.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"you are tasked to find how many districts experienced a party flip\" would be zero. But the original question isn't entirely clear whether it's about 1822 or another year.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread some entries. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at row 4 again: The result is \"retired; federalist hold.\" So, when an incumbent retires, if their party retains the seat, there's no flip. If another party takes it, that would be a flip. But in this case, since it's a 'hold' by the same party, no flip.\n\nIs there any row where the party changed? I don't see any. All results are either re-elections or same-party holds after retirement.\n\nThus, in all districts listed, the party didn't flip in 1822. Therefore, zero districts experienced a party flip.\n</think>\n\nThe number of districts that experienced a party flip during the 1822 House of Representatives elections in North Carolina is \\boxed{0}.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"charles hook and weldon edward be the last incumbent to be elect in the 1822 north carolina us house of representative election.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim correctly. It seems there's a typo; it should likely be \"Charles Hooks\" and \"Weldon Edwards.\" So, I'm looking for these two incumbents and their election status in the year 1822.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a district with details about the incumbent, party, first elected year, result, and candidates. The relevant columns here are \"incumbent,\" \"result,\" and possibly \"candidates\" to check if they were re-elected.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0: North Carolina 2**  \n   Incumbent: Hutchins G Burton  \n   Result: Re-elected  \n   Candidates: Includes the incumbent, so he was elected again. However, we're looking for 1822 elections, and the \"first elected\" year is 1819. The result here doesn't specify the election year, but since it's re-elected, perhaps this refers to a subsequent term.\n\n2. **Row 1: North Carolina 4**  \n   Incumbent: William S Blackledge  \n   Result: Retired Democratic-Republican hold  \n   This means he retired, so not relevant for being elected again in 1822.\n\n3. **Row 2: North Carolina 5**  \n   Incumbent: Charles Hooks  \n   Result: Re-elected  \n   Candidates include the incumbent with 100% vote. So, Charles Hooks was re-elected in his district. The \"first elected\" is listed as 1816 (special) and 1819, but we need to confirm if this re-election happened in 1822.\n\n4. **Row 3: North Carolina 6**  \n   Incumbent: Weldon N Edwards  \n   Result: Re-elected  \n   Candidates include him with 100%. So, he was also re-elected. His \"first elected\" is 1816 (special). Again, need to check if this was in 1822.\n\n5. **Row 4: North Carolina 7**  \n   Incumbent: Archibald McNeill  \n   Result: Retired Federalist hold  \n   He retired, so not relevant.\n\n6. **Row 5: North Carolina 9**  \n   Incumbent: Romulus M Saunders  \n   Result: Re-elected with 100%. His \"first elected\" is 1821. So, this re-election would likely be in 1823 or later, not 1822.\n\n7. **Row 6: North Carolina 10**  \n   Incumbent: John Long  \n   Result: Re-elected with 66.9%. His \"first elected\" is 1821. So, this re-election would be in 1823 or later as well.\n\nNow, the key question is whether Charles Hooks and Weldon Edwards were the last incumbents elected in 1822. The table doesn't explicitly state the election year for each result. However, their \"first elected\" years are before 1822, so if they were re-elected in 1822, that would make them incumbents up until then.\n\nBut wait, looking at Row 5 and 6: Romulus M Saunders was first elected in 1821, and John Long as well. Their re-elections (if any) would be after 1821. If the election results listed are for 1822, then both Charles Hooks and Weldon Edwards were re-elected that year. However, if the table doesn't specify the election year, it's possible these results refer to a later date.\n\nThe claim specifies \"the 1822 North Carolina US House of Representative election.\" The table might not have data for all districts in 1822, or perhaps only some incumbents were re-elected that specific year. Without explicit information about the election year in each result, it's challenging to confirm whether both Hooks and Edwards were indeed elected in 1822.\n\nAlternatively, if \"result\" indicates their status after the 1822 election, then being re-elected would mean they were last incumbents elected that year. But without a column specifying the election year for each result, I can't be certain.\n\nGiven this uncertainty and the lack of explicit 1822 data in the table, it's not possible to fully support the claim as TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be definitively confirmed because the table doesn't specify the election year for each result. While Charles Hooks and Weldon Edwards were re-elected, their results might not correspond to the 1822 election.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"there be only woman candidate in the 1822 north carolina us house of representative election\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It says that in the 1822 North Carolina US House of Representatives election, there was only one woman candidate. I need to check if any candidates listed in the table are female and whether they were the sole female candidate.\n\nLooking at the table structure: it has columns for district, incumbent, party, first elected, result, and candidates. The data rows correspond to different districts in North Carolina with their respective information.\n\nNow, the claim mentions 1822 elections, but I notice that the \"first elected\" column shows years like 1819, 1821, etc., not 1822. So perhaps this table is about candidates elected around those years, and maybe there's no direct mention of 1822. Alternatively, it might be a typo, and the intended year was 1821 or another nearby year.\n\nNext, I need to check each row for any female candidates. The \"candidates\" column lists the names with their party affiliations and sometimes percentages. Let's go through each entry:\n\nRow 0: Candidates are Hutchins G Burton (c - dr) and Jesse A Dawson. Both seem male names.\nRow 1: Richard Dobbs Spaight, Jr. (c - dr). Also a male name.\nRow 2: Charles Hooks (c - dr) and John D Jones. Male again.\nRow 3: Weldon N Edwards (c - dr) with 100%. Still male.\nRow 4: Archibald McNeill (a - f), John Culpepper, and Alexander McNeill. All males.\nRow 5: Romulus M Saunders (c - dr) with 100%. Male.\nRow 6: John Long (c - dr) and John McClelland. Both male.\n\nIn all these rows, the candidates listed are men. There's no mention of any female candidate in any district. The claim suggests that there was only one woman candidate, but according to this table, it seems there were none.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider if any of the incumbent or candidate names could be female. But looking at the names, they all appear to be male given the first names and context (like \"Jr.\" in row 1).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the table, there are no women candidates listed. Hence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"candidates\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"candidates\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"candidates\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"candidates\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"candidates\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"candidates\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"candidates\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
