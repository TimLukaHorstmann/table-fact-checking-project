    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the fullback ken snelling be pick 58 in round 7.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what we're looking for. We need to find a player named Ken Snelling who plays as a fullback, and check if he was picked number 58 in round 7.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to see if any match these criteria. The columns are \"round\", \"pick\", \"player\", \"position\", and \"school / club team.\" \n\nStarting from the top, let's scan for the name Ken Snelling. Scanning down, in row 4 (since rows start at 0), I find \"ken snelling\" listed as the player. Let me check his details:\n\n- Round: 7\n- Pick: 58\n- Position: fullback\n\nThis matches exactly with what the claim states. So, the relevant cells here are from row 4.\n\nTo make sure there's no other Ken Snelling in the table, I'll quickly scan through the rest of the rows. The next few rows don't have that name again, so it seems this is the only entry for him.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because all the specified details align with the information provided in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Ken Snelling was picked 58 in round 7 as a fullback. Checking row 4 of the table confirms this: position is 'fullback', player name is 'ken snelling', pick number is 58, and round is 7.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Claim Components:**\n   - Player Name: Ken Snelling\n   - Position: Fullback\n   - Pick Number: 58\n   - Round: 7\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Row in the Table:**\n   - Scan through each row until \"ken snelling\" is found in row 4.\n\n3. **Verify Each Detail:**\n   - Position matches as 'fullback'.\n   - Pick number is 58.\n   - Round is 7.\n\nAll details match, so the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim about George Zellick being a center from Oregon State is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It has five columns: round, pick, player, position, and school/club team. Each row represents a different player with their respective details.\n\nThe claim states that George Zellick has a position of \"center\" and attended \"Oregon State.\" My goal is to check these two pieces of information against the table.\n\nI'll start by looking through each row in the data array to find any mention of George Zellick. Scanning through, I notice that at row index 24 (since indexing starts at 0), there's a player named George Zellick. Let me verify this: \n\nRow 24: [25, 238, \"gene bierhaus\", \"end\", \"minnesota\"] \u2013 Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Let me recount the rows properly.\n\nWait, row index starts at 0 for the first data entry:\n\n- Row 0: Dick Wildung\n- ...\n- Row 24: George Zellick? Let me check again because earlier when I went through the list, I saw that George Zellick is actually in row 23 (since the table has 32 rows). Wait no, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, looking back, let's count from 0 to 31:\n\nRow 24: [25, 238, \"gene bierhaus\", \"end\", \"minnesota\"]\n\nHmm, that doesn't match. Let me check again more carefully. Perhaps the row index I'm considering is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Looking at the data array:\n\nThe first data entry is index 0: Dick Wildung.\n\nThen, moving down, each subsequent row increments by 1 until we reach the end of the data array, which has 32 entries (indices 0 to 31).\n\nNow, checking each player name for \"George Zellick\":\n\n- At row index 24: [25, 238, \"gene bierhaus\", \"end\", \"minnesota\"] \u2013 Not him.\n- Row 26: George Makris? No. \nWait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nLooking again through each data entry:\n\nRow 0: Dick Wildung\nRow 1: Irv Comp\n...\nRow 23: [24, 228, \"george zellick\", \"end\", \"oregon state\"]\n\nAh, there it is. So George Zellick is in row index 23.\n\nNow, checking his position and school:\n\n- Position: The claim says \"center.\" Looking at the table, his position is listed as \"end.\"\n- School/Club Team: Claim says \"Oregon State,\" which matches the table.\n\nSo, the position doesn't match. Therefore, the claim is incorrect regarding his position.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are George Zellick's position (row 23, column 'position') and school (row 23, column 'school/club team').\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
