The claim is: \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri live to be the oldest prime minister, 1872 - 1963.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is stating. It says that Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri lived to be the oldest prime minister with a lifespan from 1872 to 1963.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: \"name\", \"born - died\", \"term start\", \"term end\", and \"political party\". The data rows include entries for different prime ministers between 1928-1939. There are five rows in total, with the first row being a header or maybe just indicating the time period.\n\nNow, I'll check each relevant part of the claim against the table:\n\n1. **Name Verification**: The name mentioned is \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri\". Looking at the data rows, I see an entry: \"mehdi bej frash\\u00ebri  (1st time)\" which seems to match when decoded from Unicode. So this checks out.\n\n2. **Lifespan Verification**: The claim states he lived from 1872-1963. In the table, under the \"born - died\" column for Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's row (row index 3), it shows \"1872 - 1963\". This matches exactly with the claim.\n\n3. **Oldest Prime Minister Claim**: The claim says he was the oldest. To verify this, I need to check the lifespans of all prime ministers listed in the table.\n\nLooking at each prime minister's lifespan:\n- Kostaq Kota (row 1): Born 1889, died 1949.\n- Pandeli Evangjeli (row 2): Born 1859, died 1939.\n- Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri (row 3): Born 1872, died 1963.\n- Kostaq Kota again (row 4): Same as row 1.\n\nComparing the death years: 1949, 1939, 1963, and 1949. Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's death year is the latest at 1963, making him the oldest among those listed. His lifespan also spans the longest in this context.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim\u2014his lifespan and being the oldest\u2014are supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"born - died\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the earliest term start on 5 september 1928 under kostaq kota 's leadership.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what needs to be verified. The claim mentions two things: the earliest term start date and who was leading at that time.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the relevant columns are \"name\" and \"term start\". I'll check each row in the data array to find the term start dates and the corresponding leaders.\n\nRow 0 seems to be a header or title, so it can be ignored. \n\nRow 1: \n- Name is \"kostaq kota (1st time)\".\n- Term start is \"5 september 1928\".\nThis matches the claim exactly.\n\nRow 2:\n- Name is \"pandeli evangjeli (2nd time)\".\n- Term start is \"6 march 1930\", which is later than September 1928.\n\nRow 3:\n- Name is \"mehdi bej frasheri (1st time)\".\n- Term start is \"22 october 1935\", also later.\n\nRow 4:\n- Name is \"kostaq kota (2nd time)\".\n- Term start is \"9 november 1936\", which is even later than the previous ones.\n\nSo, from this, the earliest term start date listed in the table is indeed September 5, 1928, under Kostaq Kota's leadership.

The claim says, \"all prime ministers on the list have no political party.\" Let me start by understanding what each part of the table and the claim mean.\n\nFirst, looking at the table structure: it has columns named \"name\", \"born - died\", \"term start\", \"term end\", and \"political party\". The data is presented in rows, with each row representing a prime minister's information. \n\nThe first row seems a bit odd because all the entries are \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939.\" That might be a header or a label for the list of PMs from that period. So I should probably focus on the subsequent rows which have actual names and details.\n\nNow, looking at each PM's political party:\n\n- The first entry after the header is Kostaq Kota (1st time). His political party is listed as \"non - party.\" That means he doesn't belong to any political party.\n  \n- Next up is Pandeli Evangjeli (2nd time), and his political party is also \"non - party.\" So same here, no party.\n\n- Then we have Mehdi Bej Frasheri (1st time). His entry under the political party column is again \"non - party.\"\n\n- Finally, Kostaq Kota (2nd time) has the same \"non - party\" listed.\n\nSo all four PMs in the data rows have their political party as \"non - party,\" which aligns with the claim that they have no political party. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The header row might be confusing because it's repeated, but since the subsequent rows are specific individuals, each with a non-party status, there doesn't seem to be any PM in this list who belongs to a political party.\n\nTherefore, the claim that all prime ministers on the list have no political party is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that every prime minister listed has \"no political party.\" Checking each relevant cell under the \"political party\" column for rows 1 through 4 shows that all entries are \"non - party,\" confirming the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"kostaq kota's term start on 9 november 1936, after mehdi bej frash\u00ebri's term end.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what the claim is saying. It states that Kostaq Kota started his term on November 9, 1936, and this happened after Mehdi Bej Frasheri's term ended. So I need to check two things: when did Kostaq Kota start his term, and when did Mehdi Bej Frasheri end his term.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns for \"name,\" \"born - died,\" \"term start,\" \"term end,\" and \"political party.\" The data rows include entries for both Kostaq Kota (appearing twice) and Mehdi Bej Frasheri.\n\nLet me go through each relevant row:\n\n1. For Kostaq Kota's second term, the row index is 4. His term started on November 9, 1936.\n2. For Mehdi Bej Frasheri's first time as PM, his term ended on November 9, 1936.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting at first glance because both terms are associated with the same date. But let me double-check: Kostaq Kota started on November 9, and Mehdi ended on the same day. So does that mean Kostaq's term started after Mehdi's ended? Or was it on the same day?\n\nIn some cases, a new term can start on the same day another ends, which might count as \"after\" in the sense of not overlapping but sequentially. However, strictly speaking, if both events happened on the same date, whether one is considered to have started after the other depends on how the transition occurred. But looking at the data, I don't see any information about the exact time within that day. So, based solely on dates, Kostaq's term start and Mehdi's term end are both on November 9, 1936.\n\nTherefore, the claim states that Kostaq's term started after Mehdi's ended, but according to the table, their terms transitioned on the same day. So is this considered \"after\"? If they happened on the same date, it might not necessarily be after. Maybe they are consecutive but not strictly after in a temporal sense beyond the same day.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that if Mehdi's term ended on November 9, and Kostaq's started on the same day, then Kostaq's term did start after Mehdi's ended. It might depend on how the transition is structured. If one ended at a certain time and the other began later that day, it could be considered \"after.\" But without specific timestamps, it's ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that if two terms are back-to-back on the same date, the starting term would logically come after the ending term of the previous PM. So perhaps in this context, Kostaq's term started immediately following Mehdi's end on the same day, making the claim true.\n\nBut another perspective is that since both events occurred on the same day, it might not be accurate to say that Kostaq's term started after Mehdi's ended because they are concurrent. However, in governmental transitions, often a new term begins right after the previous one ends, even if on the same calendar date.\n\nSo, given this ambiguity, I think the claim is considered true because the start of Kostaq's term follows the end of Mehdi's term on the same day, effectively making it after.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"term start\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"term end\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"kostaq kota mehdi bej frash\u00ebri be both 1st time prime minister of albania.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has five columns: name, born - died, term start, term end, and political party. There are several rows of data under these columns. \n\nThe claim mentions two individuals: Kostaq Kota and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri. Both are said to be 1st time prime ministers of Albania. I need to check if both of them indeed served as the first-time PMs.\n\nLooking at the data, row indices start from 0, but the actual data starts from index 1 because the first row seems like a header or perhaps an introductory note about the table covering prime ministers from 1928-1939. So, let's focus on rows 1 through 4.\n\nRow 1: Name is \"kostaq kota (1st time)\". Born-died is 1889-1949. Term start is 5 September 1928, term end is 5 March 1930. Political party is non-party. So Kostaq Kota served as PM for the first time starting in 1928.\n\nRow 2: Name is \"pandeli evangjeli (2nd time)\". Term start is 6 March 1930, term end is 16 October 1935. He's a non-party as well.\n\nRow 3: Name is \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri (1st time)\". Born-died 1872-1963. Term start on 22 October 1935, term end 9 November 1936. Also non-party.\n\nRow 4: Kostaq Kota again, second time, starting from 9 November 1936 to 8 April 1939.\n\nSo the claim says both were first-time PMs. From the table, row 1 shows Kostaq Kota as (1st time), and row 3 shows Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri as (1st time). Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in these rows under the 'name' column.\n\nI need to make sure that there's no other information contradicting this. Both have entries marked as their first term, so it seems accurate.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: name, born - died, term start, term end, and political party. There are five rows in total, with the first row being headers for each column. So, the relevant data is from rows 1 to 4.\n\nThe claim compares two prime ministers: mehdi bej frash\u00ebri and pandeli evangjeli. I need to determine their ages at death and see if mehdi was indeed the second oldest after pandeli.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For pandeli evangjeli, row index 2 (since rows start from 0, data starts at 1), his born-died is \"1859 - 1939\". So he lived from 1859 to 1939. That's 1939 minus 1859 equals 80 years old.\n\n- For mehdi bej frash\u00ebri, row index 3, his born-died is \"1872 - 1963\". So he lived from 1872 to 1963. That's 1963 minus 1872 equals 91 years old.\n\nWait, but pandeli died in 1939 at 80, while mehdi died in 1963 at 91. So actually, mehdi lived longer and was older when he died than pandeli. Therefore, mehdi would be the oldest, not the second.\n\nBut wait, let's check all entries to make sure there isn't another prime minister who is older than mehdi. The other entries are:\n\n- kostaq kota (1st time): 1889 - 1949 \u2192 age 60\n- kostaq kota (2nd time): same as above, 60 years\n\nSo among all, pandeli is 80 and mehdi is 91. So the oldest is mehdi, then pandeli is next at 80.\n\nBut the claim says mehdi was the second oldest after pandeli. That would mean pandeli is older than mehdi, which isn't the case. Since mehdi lived longer (91 vs 80), he's actually the oldest, making pandeli the second oldest. So the claim has it backwards.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri was the second oldest prime minister after Pandeli Evangjeli. However, based on their birth and death years from the table:\n\n- Pandeli Evangjeli: Born in 1859, Died in 1939 (lived 80 years)\n- Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri: Born in 1872, Died in 1963 (lived 91 years)\n\nMehdi lived longer than Pandeli. Thus, Mehdi is the oldest, making the claim FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"born - died\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"born - died\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The data rows are from index 0 to 4.\n\nRow 1 is about Kostaq Kota (1st time). His term starts on September 5, 1928, and ends on March 5, 1930.\n\nRow 2 is Pandeli Evangjeli (2nd time). He started on March 6, 1930, and ended on October 16, 1935.\n\nRow 4 is Kostaq Kota again (2nd time). His term starts on November 9, 1936, which comes after Pandeli Evangjeli's term end date of October 16, 1935. \n\nWait a second, the claim says that Kostaq's term started after Pandeli's ended. According to row 4, Kostaq's term starts in 1936, which is indeed after 1935 when Pandeli ended his term.\n\nSo, both relevant pieces of information are found in row 2 and row 4 under the 'term end' and 'term start' columns respectively. \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Kostaq's second term does start after Pandeli's term ended.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"term end\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"term start\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the only 1st time minister of Albania be pandeli evangjeli\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It states that Pandeli Evangjeli was the only first-time minister of Albania. So, I need to check if there are any other prime ministers listed who served for the first time besides him.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n- The columns are: name, born-died, term start, term end, political party.\n- There are 5 rows in total, with row indices from 0 to 4. However, the first row seems to be a header or a general title, so the actual data starts from row index 1.\n\nNow, let's examine each relevant row:\n\nRow 1: Kostaq Kota (1st time)\n- He is listed as serving for the first time. So, he was also a first-time minister.\n\nRow 2: Pandeli Evangjeli (2nd time)\nWait, the claim says he was the only 1st time minister. But according to this row, it's his second term. That means he previously served before, so he wasn't a first-timer when he took office in March 1930.\n\nRow 3: Mehdi Bej Frasheri (1st time)\n- He is listed as serving for the first time, making him another first-time minister.\n\nRow 4: Kostaq Kota (2nd time)\n- His second term starts after Mehdi's term ends in 1936. So he served twice as well.\n\nWait a minute, I'm getting conflicting information here. The claim says Pandeli was the only first-time minister, but according to row 1 and row 3, there are two other first-time ministers: Kostaq Kota (first time) and Mehdi Bej Frasheri (first time). So that would mean there were three first-time ministers in this period.\n\nWait no, let me double-check. The claim is about the \"only 1st time minister.\" If there's more than one, then the claim is false.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Kostaq Kota served twice: once as his first term (row 1) and again later (row 4). So in row 1, he was a first-time minister.\n- Pandeli Evangjeli served twice as well; the second time is mentioned in row 2. His first term isn't listed here, so perhaps he wasn't a first-time minister in this table's data.\n- Mehdi Bej Frasheri (row 3) served once, his first time.\n\nSo, according to the table, there are two first-time ministers: Kostaq Kota (first time) and Mehdi Bej Frasheri. Pandeli Evangjeli isn't listed as a first-time minister in this data; instead, it's his second term that's recorded.\n\nTherefore, since there are other first-time ministers besides Pandeli Evangjeli, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows multiple prime ministers who served for the first time, including Kostaq Kota and Mehdi Bej Frasheri. Thus, Pandeli Evangjeli was not the only one.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
