    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"kansas city have no post- season record in 2013\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the JSON data. The table has several columns: season, manager, record, win %, post-season record, post-season win %, and MLB affiliate. Each row represents a different season from 2001 to 2013 with various details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"kansas city\" and specifically refers to the year 2013. So my first step is to find the row where the season is 2013 and the MLB affiliate is kansas city. Looking through the data, I see that the last row has the season \"2013\" and the MLB affiliate as \"kansas city\". That's the relevant row here.\n\nNow, I need to check if there's any post-season record for this team in 2013. The columns related to post-season are \"post- season record\" and \"post- season win %\". In the table, each of these fields is either filled with a value or marked as \"-\". \n\nLooking at row index 12 (since indexing starts from 0), I see that for the 2013 season under kansas city, both \"post- season record\" and \"post- season win %\" have \"-\" entries. This typically indicates that there is no data available for those fields, which in this context likely means they didn't participate in the post-season or their performance wasn't recorded.\n\nSo, based on this information, the claim that \"kansas city have no post- season record in 2013\" is accurate because both relevant cells show \"-\" indicating absence of data. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"post  - season record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"post  - season win%\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"houston have no post- season record\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the table represents and how it relates to the claim.\n\nFirst, looking at the columns: there's \"season\", \"manager\", \"record\", \"win %\", \"post- season record\", \"post- season win %\", and \"mlb affiliate\". The claim is about Houston not having a post-season record. That means I need to check if any of Houston's entries in the table have data under \"post- season record\".\n\nThe \"mlb affiliate\" column shows that most teams are affiliated with Houston, except for 2013 which is Kansas City. So I can focus on rows where \"mlb affiliate\" is Houston.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\nRow 0: 2001 season, post-season record is 4-0. Since this is under Houston's affiliation, it shows a post-season record exists.\nRow 1: 2002 season, no data for post-season because both \"post- season record\" and \"post- season win %\" are \"-\".\nRows 2 to 5 (2003 to 2006): Some have post-season records. For example, row 2 has a 0-2 record in the playoffs.\nRows 6 to 12: Most of these don't have post-season data except for some years where it's \"-\" which I think means no post-season play.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"have no post- season record\". So if there exists at least one year where Houston had a post-season record (i.e., not \"-\"), then the claim is FALSE. Looking back, row 0 has a 4-0 record in post-season, which contradicts the claim.\n\nTherefore, since there are entries with non-zero post-season records under Houston's affiliation, the claim that Houston has no post-season record is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there are instances where Houston had a post-season record. For example, in 2001, they have a post-season record of 4-0.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"post- season record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"post- season record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
