    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the team with 3 loss have 0 tie\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the structure of the table. The columns are: team, games played, wins, losses, ties, goals for, goals against. There are five rows of data corresponding to different teams.\n\nThe claim is about teams that have 3 losses and checking if their number of ties is 0. So, I need to find all teams in the table where the 'losses' column equals 3 and then check what their 'ties' value is.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Montreal Hockey Club has 5 wins, 3 losses, 0 ties.\n   - Losses = 3 \u2192 Check if Ties = 0? Yes.\n\n2. **Row 1**: Ottawa Hockey Club also has 5 wins, 3 losses, 0 ties.\n   - Losses = 3 \u2192 Check if Ties = 0? Yes.\n\n3. **Row 2**: Montreal Victorias have 5 wins, 3 losses, 0 ties.\n   - Losses = 3 \u2192 Check if Ties = 0? Yes.\n\n4. **Row 3**: Quebec Hockey Club has 5 wins, 3 losses, 0 ties.\n   - Losses = 3 \u2192 Check if Ties = 0? Yes.\n\n5. **Row 4**: Montreal Crystals have 0 wins, 8 losses, and their ties are also 0, but since their losses are not 3, this row doesn't apply to the claim.\n\nSo, for all teams with exactly 3 losses (rows 0,1,2,3), each of them has 0 ties. There's no exception where a team with 3 losses has more than 0 ties. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells are the 'losses' and 'ties' columns for all rows where 'losses' equal 3. That includes four rows (indices 0 to 3) each contributing two cells: 'losses' and 'ties'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"ties\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ties\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"ties\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"ties\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
