    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"justin rose be from the united state\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: place, player, country, score, and to par. The data rows are listed in order. My main focus is on finding Justin Rose's information because that's what the claim is about.\n\nI'll scan through each row under the \"player\" column to find Justin Rose. Let's go through them one by one:\n\n- Row 0: Brian Watts\n- Row 1: Jim Furyk\n- Row 2: Mark O'Meara\n- Row 3: Jesper Parnevik\n- Row 4: Justin Rose (a)\n- Row 5: Thomas Bj\u00f8rn\n- Rows 6,7,8: Brad Faxon, John Huston, Tiger Woods\n- Rows 9-12: David Duval, Costantino Rocca, Raymond Russell, Katsuyoshi Tomori\n\nSo, Justin Rose is in row index 4. Now, the claim is about his country of origin. Looking at the \"country\" column for that same row, I see it says \"england\". \n\nThe claim states he's from the United States, but according to the table, his country is England. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nI should also check if there are any other instances or mentions of Justin Rose in the table to ensure consistency. Scanning through, I don't see any other entries for him beyond row 4. So, all relevant information points to his country being England.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are from row 4, specifically the \"player\" and \"country\" columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 4,\n       \"column_name\": \"player\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 4,\n       \"column_name\": \"country\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"danish thomas bj\u00f8rn rank lower than tiger wood\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. The columns are \"place\", \"player\", \"country\", \"score\", and \"to par\". Each row represents a player's performance in some event, probably a golf tournament since I see scores like 68, 69, etc., which are typical in golf.\n\nThe claim is about two players: Danish Thomas Bj\u00f8rn and Tiger Woods. The assertion is that Thomas Bj\u00f8rn has a lower rank than Tiger Woods. In sports, especially golf, the rank or place typically refers to how well they performed compared to others. A lower numerical value usually means a better performance because it indicates fewer strokes.\n\nLooking at the data, I'll scan through each row to find both players.\n\nStarting with Thomas Bj\u00f8rn:\n- Scanning the \"player\" column, I see Thomas Bj\u00f8rn is listed in the 6th row (index 5 if starting from 0). His place is \"t6\", which likely means he's tied for 6th position. His score is 215 with a \"+5\" to par.\n\nNow Tiger Woods:\n- Looking further down, I find Tiger Woods in the 9th row (index 8). His place is also \"t6\", meaning he's tied for 6th as well. His score is 215, same as Thomas Bj\u00f8rn, with a \"+5\" to par.\n\nSo both players are tied at 6th place. The claim says that Thomas Bj\u00f8rn ranks lower than Tiger Woods. Since they're both in the same position (tied for 6th), one isn't lower than the other; they have equal ranks.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by the data because their places are identical. Hence, it's FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\":8, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
