    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the game play on december 6 , 1964 be during week 13\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It's stating that a game played on December 6, 1964 occurred in week 13.\n\nLooking at the JSON structure of the table, I see it has columns: \"week\", \"date\", \"opponent\", \"result\", and \"attendance\". The data is an array of rows where each row corresponds to a game with these details.\n\nMy task is to check if there's a row where the date is December 6, 1964 and if that same row indicates week 13. If both conditions are met in the same row, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nI'll go through each row of data:\n\nRow 0: Week 1, September 13, 1964\nRow 1: Week 2, September 19, 1964\nRow 2: Week 3, September 27, 1964\nRow 3: Week 4, October 3, 1964\nRow 4: Week 5, October 10, 1964\nRow 5: Week 6, October 16, 1964\nRow 6: Week 7, October 25, 1964\nRow 7: Week 8, November 1, 1964\nRow 8: Week 9, November 8, 1964\nRow 9: Week 10, November 15, 1964\nRow 10: Week 11, November 22, 1964\nRow 11: Week 12, November 29, 1964\nRow 12: Week 13, December 6, 1964\nRow 13: Week 14, December 20, 1964\n\nLooking at row 12 (index starts at 0, so it's actually the 13th element in zero-based indexing), I see that week is 13 and date is December 6, 1964. This matches both conditions of the claim.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are in row 12 (week) and row 12 (date). The claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the game play on december 6, 1964 be after week 13\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: It says that the game played on December 6, 1964 happened after week 13. So, I need to find out what week number corresponds to December 6, 1964 in the table and see if it's indeed after week 13.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a week with details like the date, opponent, result, and attendance. The \"week\" column indicates the week number, and the \"date\" column shows the specific date of that week's game.\n\nI'll scan through the data rows to find the one where the date is December 6, 1964. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Week 1: September 13, 1964\n- Week 2: September 19, 1964\n- Week 3: September 27, 1964\n- Week 4: October 3, 1964\n- Week 5: October 10, 1964\n- Week 6: October 16, 1964\n- Week 7: October 25, 1964\n- Week 8: November 1, 1964\n- Week 9: November 8, 1964\n- Week 10: November 15, 1964\n- Week 11: November 22, 1964\n- Week 12: November 29, 1964\n- Week 13: December 6, 1964\n- Week 14: December 20, 1964\n\nAh, I see that the game on December 6, 1964 is listed in week 13. The claim says it's after week 13. So if a game is in week 13, then any game after week 13 would be in week 14 or later.\n\nLooking at the next weeks: Week 14 is December 20, which comes after December 6. Therefore, the game on December 6 was in week 13 itself, not after it. The claim states that this date is after week 13, but according to the table, it's exactly during week 13.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the game occurred in week 13, not after it.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the game on December 6, 1964 was in week 13, not after.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the date mentioned in the claim: December 2, 1963. I need to check if there's a game in the table with that exact date and see what week it corresponds to.\n\nLooking through the \"date\" column of each row:\n\n- Week 1: September 13, 1964\n- Week 2: September 19, 1964\n- Week 3: September 27, 1964\n- Week 4: October 3, 1964\n- Week 5: October 10, 1964\n- Week 6: October 16, 1964\n- Week 7: October 25, 1964\n- Week 8: November 1, 1964\n- Week 9: November 8, 1964\n- Week 10: November 15, 1964\n- Week 11: November 22, 1964\n- Week 12: November 29, 1964\n- Week 13: December 6, 1964\n- Week 14: December 20, 1964\n\nI don't see any date that matches December 2, 1963. In fact, all the dates in the table are from 1964, not 1963. So, there's no game played on December 2, 1963.\n\nAdditionally, even if I consider a typo where the year is 1964 instead of 1963, looking at week 15: The table only goes up to week 14 (December 20, 1964). There's no week 15 in this data. So, the claim mentions week 15, but our table doesn't have that week.\n\nTherefore, since there's no game on December 2, 1963, and no week 15 exists in the provided schedule, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
