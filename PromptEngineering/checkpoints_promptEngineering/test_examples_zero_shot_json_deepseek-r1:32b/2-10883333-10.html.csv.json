    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"the prince park venue have more crowd than the junction oval menu.\" Hmm, first off, I think there might be a typo in the claim. It should probably say \"venue\" instead of \"menu,\" right? So maybe it's supposed to be comparing Prince Park and Junction Oval venues.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row has information about different matches on June 7, 1975. The columns include \"home team,\" \"home team score,\" \"away team,\" \"away team score,\" \"venue,\" \"crowd,\" and \"date.\" So to verify the claim, I need to look at the crowd numbers for Prince Park and Junction Oval.\n\nLet me scan through each row:\n\n1. First row: Kardinia Park, crowd 13,328.\n2. Second row: Moorabbin Oval, crowd 17,811.\n3. Third row: MCG, crowd 49,469.\n4. Fourth row: Prince Park (I think it's written as \"princes park\" in the data), crowd 23,830.\n5. Fifth row: Junction Oval, crowd 16,249.\n6. Sixth row: VFL Park, crowd 14,056.\n\nSo Prince Park has a crowd of 23,830 and Junction Oval has 16,249. Comparing these two numbers, 23,830 is definitely more than 16,249. Therefore, the claim that Prince Park had more crowd than Junction Oval is TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells. I need to find which rows and columns contain this information. The \"venue\" column tells us where each match was held, and the \"crowd\" column shows the number of attendees.\n\nLooking at row 3 (index starts at 0), it's Prince Park with a crowd of 23830. So row index 3 for both \"venue\" and \"crowd\". Then, row 4 is Junction Oval with 16249, so row index 4 for both columns.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- For Prince Park: row 3, \"venue\" and row 3, \"crowd\".\n- For Junction Oval: row 4, \"venue\" and row 4, \"crowd\".\n\nPutting that together, the JSON should reflect these four cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The table has columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a match with corresponding data.\n\nThe claim mentions \"north melbourne\" and their score. From the table, north melbourne is listed as an away team in one of the rows (row index 1). Their score is \"17.19 (121)\". Now, I need to check if this is indeed the highest score among all teams.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Geelong vs Melbourne - Scores are 104 and 98.\n2. Row 1: St Kilda vs North Melbourne - Scores are 99 and 121. So, north melbourne scored 121 here.\n3. Row 2: Richmond vs Essendon - Scores are 128 and 81.\n4. Row 3: Hawthorn vs Collingwood - Scores are 138 and 89.\n5. Row 4: Fitzroy vs Carlton - Scores are 97 and 106.\n6. Row 5: Footscray vs South Melbourne - Scores are 89 and 87.\n\nNow, I'll list all the scores:\n\n- Geelong: 104\n- Melbourne: 98\n- St Kilda: 99\n- North Melbourne: 121\n- Richmond: 128\n- Essendon: 81\n- Hawthorn: 138\n- Collingwood: 89\n- Fitzroy: 97\n- Carlton: 106\n- Footscray: 89\n- South Melbourne: 87\n\nThe highest score is 138 by Hawthorn.

Each row represents a game with these details.\n\nThe claim is about two teams: Fitzroy and Footscray. I need to find their respective scores from the table.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n- Row 4 has Fitzroy as the home team with a score of \"15.7 (97)\".\n- Row 5 has Footscray as the home team with a score of \"13.11 (89)\".\n\nI should compare their scores. In Australian rules football, the score is usually presented in the format of goals behinds (total points). The numbers inside the parentheses are the total points calculated from goals and behinds.\n\nFitzroy's score: 15 goals and 7 behinds, totaling 97 points.\nFootscray's score: 13 goals and 11 behinds, totaling 89 points.\n\nComparing these, Fitzroy has a higher score (97) than Footscray (89). Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nTo answer correctly, I need to identify which cells in the table were relevant.

The claim is about two venues: Kardinia Park and Moorabbin Oval. It says that Kardinia Park has a smaller crowd than Moorabbin Oval.\n\nI need to find the rows where these venues are listed. Let me scan through each data row:\n\n1. The first row mentions Kardinia Park as the venue with a crowd of 13,328.\n2. The second row lists Moorabbin Oval with a crowd of 17,811.\n\nSo, comparing these two numbers: Kardinia Park's crowd is 13,328 and Moorabbin Oval's is 17,811. Since 13,328 is less than 17,811, the claim that Kardinia Park has a smaller crowd than Moorabbin Oval is TRUE.\n\nI should also note which cells are relevant for this determination.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the prince park venue have just as much crowd as the junction oval menu\". Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should parse the table data correctly. Looking at the JSON structure, there are six rows of data. Each row has details about a game played on June 7, 1975. The columns include home team, their score, away team, their score, venue, crowd size, and date.\n\nThe claim mentions two venues: Prince Park and Junction Oval. So I need to find the rows where these venues are listed and check their respective crowd numbers.\n\nStarting with \"Prince Park\", looking through the data, I see that in row 3 (index starts at 0), the venue is \"princes park\". The crowd number there is 23830. Then for \"Junction Oval\", checking the rows, I find it in row 4, where the venue is \"junction oval\" and the crowd size is 16249.\n\nThe claim states that these two venues have \"just as much crowd\". That would mean their crowd numbers should be equal. However, comparing 23830 (Prince Park) to 16249 (Junction Oval), they are not equal. \n\nSo the claim is incorrect because the crowd sizes at Prince Park and Junction Oval on that date were different.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells for this determination. I need to reference the rows where these venues appear. For Prince Park, it's row 3 with columns \"venue\" and \"crowd\". Similarly, for Junction Oval, it's row 4 with the same columns.\n\nWait a second, looking back at the instructions, each cell should be an object in the relevant_cells list. So each entry includes the row index and column name. That means for Prince Park, I'll have two entries: one for \"venue\" to confirm it's the correct venue and another for \"crowd\" to get the number. The same applies to Junction Oval.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Row 3, column \"venue\": confirms the venue is Prince Park.\n- Row 3, column \"crowd\": shows 23830 people attended.\n- Row 4, column \"venue\": confirms the venue is Junction Oval.\n- Row 4, column \"crowd\": shows 16249 people attended.\n\nThese four cells are necessary to verify both venues and their respective crowd sizes. Since the crowd numbers don't match, the claim is false.\n\nI should structure my answer accordingly, ensuring that I only include the relevant cells without any extra information.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the crowd at Prince Park equals that at Junction Oval. Checking the table:\n\n- Prince Park (Row 3) had a crowd of 23830.\n- Junction Oval (Row 4) had a crowd of 16249.\n\nSince these numbers are different, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"north melbourne have the second highest score out all the way team.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is saying. It's stating that North Melbourne has the second-highest score among all the away teams in the matches listed. So, my task is to check each row of data and extract the away team scores to see if North Melbourne indeed holds the second position.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are seven columns: \"home team,\" \"home team score,\" \"away team,\" \"away team score,\" \"venue,\" \"crowd,\" and \"date.\" Each row represents a match with details about both home and away teams. \n\nI need to focus on two specific columns for this claim: the \"away team\" and their corresponding \"away team score.\" My goal is to collect all the away team scores, determine which one is the second highest, and see if that belongs to North Melbourne.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Home team is Geelong, Away team is Melbourne. Their score is 14.14 (98). I'll note this as an away team score.\n2. **Row 1**: Home team is St Kilda, Away team is North Melbourne. Their score is 17.19 (121). This looks like a high score and could be the highest or second-highest.\n3. **Row 2**: Home team is Richmond, Away team is Essendon. Score: 12.9 (81). Lower than others so far.\n4. **Row 3**: Home team is Hawthorn, Away team is Collingwood. Score: 13.11 (89). Also lower but not as high as North Melbourne's 17.19.\n5. **Row 4**: Home team is Fitzroy, Away team is Carlton. Score: 16.10 (106). This is higher than Collingwood's and Essendon's but lower than North Melbourne's.\n6. **Row 5**: Home team is Footscray, Away team is South Melbourne. Score: 12.15 (87). This is the lowest among all away teams.\n\nNow, compiling the away team scores:\n\n- Melbourne: 98\n- North Melbourne: 121\n- Essendon: 81\n- Collingwood: 89\n- Carlton: 106\n- South Melbourne: 87\n\nArranging these in descending order gives me:\n\n1. North Melbourne: 121 (highest)\n2. Carlton: 106 (second highest)\n3. Melbourne: 98\n4. Collingwood: 89\n5. South Melbourne: 87\n6. Essendon: 81\n\nFrom this, I can see that North Melbourne actually has the highest score among away teams with 121 points. Carlton is second with 106. Therefore, the claim that North Melbourne has the second highest score isn't accurate; they have the highest.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Sometimes, it's easy to mix up which team is home or away. Let me verify each row again:\n\n- In Row 1, \"north melbourne\" are the away team with a score of 17.19 (121). That seems correct.\n  \nLooking back at all away scores, yes, North Melbourne's 121 is higher than Carlton's 106. So, the second highest would be Carlton. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because North Melbourne isn't second; they're first.\n\nSo, the claim should be FALSE.

Each row represents a match with corresponding details.\n\nThe claim is about Fitzroy's score being higher than any other team. So, I need to find all instances where Fitzroy is either the home or away team and compare their scores with others.\n\nLooking through the data rows:\n1. The first row has Geelong vs Melbourne. Neither is Fitzroy.\n2. Second row: St Kilda vs North Melbourne. No Fitzroy here either.\n3. Third row: Richmond vs Essendon. Still no Fitzroy.\n4. Fourth row: Hawthorn vs Collingwood. Again, no Fitzroy involved.\n5. Fifth row: Fitzroy is the home team against Carlton. The scores are 15.7 (97) for Fitzroy and 16.10 (106) for Carlton.\n6. Sixth row: Footscray vs South Melbourne. No Fitzroy here.\n\nSo, the only row where Fitzroy plays is the fifth one. In that match, Fitzroy scored 97 points, while Carlton scored 106.

So, the only data point for Fitzroy is their score against Carlton on 7 June 1975.\n\nGiven that in their match, they scored less than Carlton, and there are no other matches involving Fitzroy where their score could be higher than another team's, the claim cannot be supported. \n\nTherefore, the relevant cells to consider are the fifth row's home team score (Fitzroy's 97) and away team score (Carlton's 106).

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"all of the match be on different date\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that every match in the table was held on a different date. That means each row should have a unique date entry under the \"date\" column.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see there are six rows of data, each representing a different match. The columns include \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", \"away team score\", \"venue\", \"crowd\", and \"date\". My focus is on the \"date\" column because that's what the claim is about.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to check their dates:\n\n1. First row (index 0): Date is \"7 june 1975\".\n2. Second row (index 1): Also \"7 june 1975\".\n3. Third row (index 2): Same date, \"7 june 1975\".\n4. Fourth row (index 3): Again, the date is \"7 june 1975\".\n5. Fifth row (index 4): Still \"7 june 1975\".\n6. Sixth row (index 5): The same date applies here too.\n\nWait a minute, all six matches have the exact same date: June 7, 1975. That means none of them are on different dates; they're all on the same day. \n\nSo, if the claim says that \"all of the match be on different date,\" it's asserting that each match has a unique date. But since every single one is on July 6th (or June 7th), depending on how you interpret it, but regardless, they're all the same. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data.\n\nTo make sure I didn't miss anything, I'll cross-verify each row's \"date\" column. Each of them is indeed \"7 june 1975.\" There are no variations or different dates listed in any of the six matches.\n\nTherefore, since all matches share the same date and none differ, the claim that they're all on different dates must be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that every match was held on a different date. However, upon examining each row's \"date\" column, all entries are \"7 june 1975.\" Since all six matches occurred on the same day, the claim is not supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
