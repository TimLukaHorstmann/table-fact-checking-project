The tournament location is \"surbiton, great britain,\" which also aligns with the claim. So this row supports both aspects of the claim.\n\n2. **Rows 1-7**: Checking these just to be thorough. Their dates are different (April 2004, July 2004, October 2006, April 2007, April 2011, September 2012, April 2013), so they don't match June 2, 2003.

There are eight data rows corresponding to different tournaments with their details.\n\nThe claim is about a specific tournament location (Cardiff, Great Britain) on a specific date (April 16, 2007).

The claim is: \"wesley moodie be alex bogdanovic 's opponent on june 2 2003\".\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components. It mentions three key pieces of information:\n1. The name of the opponent: Wesley Moodie.\n2. The person whose opponent it is: Alex Bogdanovic (though this name isn't directly in the table).\n3. The date: June 2, 2003.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a tournament with various details. The columns are \"date\", \"tournament\", \"surface\", \"opponent in the final\", and \"score\".\n\nI'll start by searching for the date mentioned, which is \"2 june 2003\". Scanning through the 'date' column, I see that the first row has this exact date: \"2 june 2003\".\n\nNext, I need to check who Alex Bogdanovic's opponent was on that date. The claim states it's Wesley Moodie. In the table, under the \"opponent in the final\" column for that date, it lists \"wesley moodie\". \n\nHowever, there's a missing piece here: the table doesn't mention Alex Bogdanovic at all. It only provides the opponent's name and other details about the match but not the player whose opponent Wesley Moodie is. Without explicit information about Alex Bogdanovic being the player who faced Wesley Moodie on that date, I can't confirm if Wesley was indeed his opponent.\n\nTherefore, while the date and opponent are correct as per the table, the absence of Alex Bogdanovic's name means we don't have enough evidence to support the entire claim. So, the claim isn't fully supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is about whether Wesley Moodie was Alex Bogdanovic's opponent on June 2, 2003. The table shows that on \"2 june 2003\", the opponent in the final was Wesley Moodie. However, there's no mention of Alex Bogdanovic in the data, so we cannot confirm if Wesley Moodie was his opponent.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

My goal is to check if there's a row in the table where the date matches April 26, 2004, and the surface is carpet.\n\nLooking at the columns provided: \"date\", \"tournament\", \"surface\", \"opponent in the final\", \"score\". So I need to focus on the \"date\" and \"surface\" columns.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. First row: date is \"2 june 2003\" \u2013 doesn't match April 26, so skip.\n2.

The data doesn't include the name of the person who faced Rik De Voest on April 8, 2013. Without that information, we can't confirm if Alex Bogdanovic was indeed the one playing against Rik.\n\nSince the table only provides the opponent's name and not the player's name, there's no way to verify whether the claim about Alex Bogdanovic is accurate based on this data alone.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be verified because while April 8, 2013, has an entry with Rik De Voest as the opponent, the table doesn't specify who played against him.
