    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"Michael Phelps has more medals than Larisa Latynina\" is true based on the provided data table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find all entries related to Michael Phelps and Larisa Latynina. \n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Rows 18 to 22 are about Michael Phelps:\n  - Row 18: Gold (G)\n  - Row 19: Gold (G)\n  - Row 20: Gold (G)\n  - Row 21: Gold (G)\n  - Row 22: Gold (G)\n\nThat's a total of 5 gold medals for Michael.\n\nNow, searching for Larisa Latynina:\n\n- Rows 13 to 18 are about her:\n  - Row 13: Gold (G)\n  - Row 14: Silver (S)\n  - Row 15: Silver (S)\n  - Row 16: Bronze (B)\n  - Row 17: Bronze (B)\n  - Row 18: Silver (S)\n\nSo, Larisa has 3 golds, but wait, let me recount. Wait, in the data provided:\n\nWait, looking again at her entries:\n- Row 13: Gold\n- Row 14: Gold\n- Row 15: Silver\n- Row 16: Bronze\n- Row 17: Bronze\n- Row 18: Silver\n\nSo, that's actually 2 gold medals for Larisa.\n\nWait no, row 13 is \"team \u00e9p\u00e9e g\" which is gold. So rows:\n\nRow 13: Gold (g)\nRow 14: All-around s \u2013 silver\nRow 15: Vault s \u2013 silver\nRow 16: Uneven bars b \u2013 bronze\nRow 17: Balance beam b \u2013 bronze\nRow 18: Floor exercise g \u2013 gold\n\nSo, total for Larisa:\n- Gold: rows 13 and 18 \u2192 2 golds.\n- Silver: rows 14, 15 \u2192 2 silvers.\n- Bronze: rows 16,17 \u2192 2 bronzes.\n\nWait no, that's a total of 2+2+2=6 medals. But the claim is about who has more medals, regardless of type? Or only comparing golds?\n\nThe original claim says \"more medal than,\" which could be interpreted as total medals or just gold. The user didn't specify, but in Olympic contexts, medals are often counted across all types unless specified otherwise.\n\nBut looking at the data:\n\nMichael Phelps has 5 entries (rows 18-22), each with Gold. So that's 5 medals.\n\nLarisa Latynina has rows 13 to 18: that's 6 rows, so 6 medals.\n\nSo Michael has 5, Larisa has 6. Therefore, the claim is false because Michael does not have more medals than her; she has more.\n\nWait but in the data:\n\nLooking at each row for both:\n\nMichael:\n- Row 18: gold\n- 19: gold\n- 20: gold\n- 21: gold\n- 22: gold\n\nTotal of 5 medals.\n\nLarisa:\nRows 13 to 18 (rows are indexed from 0, so rows 13 is index 13). Let's count each medal:\n\nRow 13: G \u2192 medal.\nRow 14: S \u2192 medal.\nRow 15: S \u2192 medal.\nRow 16: B \u2192 medal.\nRow 17: B \u2192 medal.\nRow 18: S \u2192 medal.\n\nSo that's 6 medals for Larisa. So yes, she has more.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Michael has fewer medals than her.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Medal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Medal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Medal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Medal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Medal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Medal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Medal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Medal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Medal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Medal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Medal\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the relevant information for both Larisa Latynina and Carl Osburn in the table. The table lists medalists with their respective events, but it doesn't explicitly state how many medals each person has. However, from the row indices, I can count the number of times each name appears because each row represents a medal won.\n\nStarting with Carl Osburn:\n- Looking through the rows, I see his entries at row indices 10, 11, and 12. Each of these rows corresponds to a different medal he has won. So that's three medals in total for Carl.\n\nNow checking Larisa Latynina:\n- Her entries are from row indices 13 through 18. Let me count them: row 13 is one, then 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18. That makes six medals in total for her.\n\nWait a minute, that's only five additional medals beyond Carl's three.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is saying that both Robert Garrett and James Connolly are associated with the same country. So, I need to check their respective countries from the table and see if they match.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns labeled as 0 to 21 (assuming these are row indices) with data in each column. The relevant information I'm looking for is under the \"Country\" column because that's where their nationality would be listed.\n\nNow, let me go through each row to find entries related to Robert Garrett and James Connolly.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- Row 0: Talks about Larisa Latynina, not relevant.\n- Row 1: Also Larisa Latynina, still not relevant.\n- ...\n- I keep scrolling down until I find their names. \n\nLooking through the data, I see:\n- Robert Garrett appears in rows where \"Name\" is Robert Garrett.\n- Similarly, James Connolly should be another row.\n\nWait, let me check each occurrence. In row 1 (but wait, the table seems to start with an initial set of rows; perhaps I miscounted). Let's look at the data:\n\nLooking through the data provided:\nRow indices are from 0 to 21. Let's scan for their names.\n\nI see that in some rows, under \"Name,\" there's Robert Garrett and James Connolly.\n\nFor example:\n- In row 1 (index starting at 0), looking for \"robert garrett\" or \"james connolly.\" Hmm, perhaps I need to search through all the rows.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to list out each occurrence:\n\nLooking through each entry:\n\nRow 0: Name is Larisa Latynina. Country: Soviet Union.\nRow 1: Same name and country.\n...\nWait, this might take too long manually. Alternatively, perhaps I can spot where Robert Garrett and James Connolly are mentioned.\n\nLooking further down, I find:\n- At some point, there's an entry for Michael Phelps, but that's later.\n- Earlier in the table, I see Edoardo Mangiarotti from Italy, Larisa Latynina again, then moving on to Michael Phelps.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps Robert Garrett and James Connolly are not present in this table.

Wait, no\u2014Paavo Nurmi is from Finland, but in the data provided, I see \"Finland\" or not?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Let's note their countries.\n\nFor example, in row indices where Name is Robert Garrett, what's the Country?\n\nLooking through the data:\n\nIn row 2 (index starting at 0?), wait no\u2014let me look again. The table provided shows multiple entries with names like Edoardo Mangiarotti, Larisa Latynina, Paavo Nurmi, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for any mentions of Robert Garrett or James Connolly in the Name column.\n\nAfter a thorough search, I don't see either Robert Garrett or James Connolly in this table. All the names listed are Larisa Latynina (from Soviet Union), Edoardo Mangiarotti (Italy), Paavo Nurmi (Finland), and Michael Phelps (USA).\n\nSince both Robert Garrett and James Connolly aren't present in the provided data, I can't determine their countries from here. Therefore, based on this table, there's no information about them to verify if they represent the same country.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I missed some rows.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"1 athlete receive a medal for pommel horse\" is true or false based on the provided table data.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. The key elements are:\n1. An athlete receiving a medal.\n2. The specific event or apparatus: \"pommel horse\".\n\nI'll start by looking at the structure of the table. Each row represents an instance where a medal was awarded. The columns include details like the event, date, athlete's name, and the sport.\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to find entries where the event is related to pommel horse. Pommel horse is a specific apparatus in gymnastics. So, I should look for rows where the \"Event\" column mentions pommel horse.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Rows 0 to 17: Most of these are about swimming events, fencing, and other sports not related to gymnastics.\n- Row 12: Event is \"team foil s\", which is fencing, so not relevant.\n- Rows 13 to 18: These are all gymnastics events. Specifically:\n  - Row 12 mentions \"pommel horse\" in the event description.\n  \nWait, actually, looking at row 12:\n\nRow index 12 has \"Event\": \"team foil s\". That's fencing, not pommel horse.\n\nHmm, maybe I missed it. Let me go through each row again carefully.\n\nLooking back, perhaps the pommel horse is mentioned in a different context or under a different sport category. Since pommel horse is part of gymnastics, I'll focus on rows where \"Sport\" is gymnastics.\n\nRows 12 to 18 are about Larisa Latynina and Edoardo Mangiarotti in fencing and gymnastics. Let's check each:\n\n- Row 12: \"Event\": \"team foil s\", sport \"fencing\". Not pommel horse.\n- Rows 13 onwards: Sport is gymnastics, but events include team, all-around, vault, uneven bars, balance beam, floor exercise.\n\nWait, in row 18, the event is \"floor exercise g\". No mention of pommel horse there either.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to look at all rows again. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: \"Event\": \"200m freestyle\", sport swimming.\nRow 1: Swimming events.\n...\nRows 12-13: Fencing and gymnastics team events.\nRows 14-18: Gymnastics, but specific apparatus like vault, uneven bars, balance beam.\n\nWait a minute, I think I might have missed row 12's event. Let me check again:\n\nRow index 12:\n\"Event\": \"team foil s\", sport fencing.\n\nNo pommel horse here. Maybe another row? Or perhaps the pommel horse is in a different part of the data.\n\nWait, looking back at the initial rows:\n\nRow 7: Event \"pommel horse s\", sport gymnastics.\n\nAh! I think I missed that earlier. Let me confirm:\n\nYes, row index 7 (assuming rows are zero-indexed) has:\n- Row 7: \"Event\": \"pommel horse s\", sport \"gymnastics\".\n\nWait no, looking back at the data provided, let's recount:\n\nLooking at the JSON structure, each row is an array inside the \"data\" key. Let me count the rows:\n\nRow 0: \"Edoardo mangiarotti\", \"team foil s\", fencing.\n...\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list all events in gymnastics:\n\nRows where sport is gymnastics:\n- Row 7 (assuming row index starts at 0): Event \"pommel horse s\".\n- Rows 13 to 18: Gymnastics events, but no pommel horse mentioned.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused with the indices. Let me re-examine the data:\n\nLooking at the provided data array, each row is as follows (simplified):\n\n0: Edoardo mangiarotti, team foil s, fencing\n1: Larisa Latynina, team g, gymnastics\n2: Larisa Latynina, all-around s, gymnastics\n3: Larisa Latynina, vault s, gymnastics\n4: Larisa Latynina, uneven bars b, gymnastics\n5: Larisa Latynina, balance beam b, gymnastics\n6: Larisa Latynina, floor exercise g, gymnastics\n7: Michael Phelps, 200m butterfly s, swimming\n...\n\nWait, perhaps row index 12 is where \"pommel horse\" appears. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the data array, row index 12:\n{\n    \"Name\": \"Edoardo Mangiarotti\",\n    \"Event\": \"team foil s\",\n    \"Sport\": \"fencing\",\n    ...\n}\n\nNo, that's fencing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing it entirely. Perhaps there is no entry for pommel horse in the data provided.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: fencing\nRow 1: gymnastics team\nRow 2: all-around s\nRow 3: vault s\nRow 4: uneven bars b\nRow 5: balance beam b\nRow 6: floor exercise g\nRows 7-18: mostly swimming and a few fencing.\n\nWait, I don't see any row with \"pommel horse\" as the event. That's confusing because pommel horse is a standard gymnastics apparatus. Did I miss it?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the data doesn't include pommel horse events. If that's the case, then no athlete in the provided data received a medal for pommel horse.\n\nBut the claim states that one athlete did receive such a medal. Since the data doesn't show any pommel horse entries, the claim would be false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscounting or missing something. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at each row's event:\n\n- Row 0: team foil s\n- Row 1: team g\n- Row 2: all-around s\n- Row 3: vault s\n- Row 4: uneven bars b\n- Row 5: balance beam b\n- Row 6: floor exercise g\n- Rows 7-18: swimming events, fencing.\n\nNo pommel horse in any of these. Therefore, the data does not support the claim that one athlete received a medal for pommel horse.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because there are no entries in the provided table where an athlete received a medal for the pommel horse event.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nfalse",

Let's start by parsing the claim and understanding what it means.\n\nFirst, I should check if the names in the claim match those in the table. The claim mentions \"Larisa Latyna,\" but looking at the table, I see entries for \"larisa latynina.\" It seems like a slight variation in spelling, possibly a typo in the claim. So I'll assume they're referring to the same person.\n\nNext, I need to find all the rows that correspond to Larisa Latynina and Carl Osbum. Let's go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting with the table:\n\nRows 12-13 are about Edoardo Mangiarotti from Italy in fencing events, so they don't apply here. \n\nLooking at rows 14-18: These are all entries for Larisa Latynina from the Soviet Union in gymnastics. Each of these rows represents a medal she won during the 1964 Olympics.\n\nNow, checking for Carl Osbum: Scanning through the table, I don't see any entries with that name. The closest is \"Carl Phelps\" in swimming events, but that's Michael Phelps, not Carl. So there's no data on Carl Osbum in this table.\n\nSince there's no information about Carl Osbum's medals, we can't compare his medal count to Larisa Latynina's. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the given data. \n\nMoreover, even if there were a Carl Osburn in another part of the table (which isn't the case here), without knowing how many medals he has, we couldn't determine if she has 7 less.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, the claim can't be supported because one of the key subjects isn't present in the data.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"michael phelps have less medal than larisa latyna\" is true or false based on the provided data table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim is asking.\n\nFirst, I'll check how many medals Michael Phelps has and compare it to Larisa Latynina's total medals. The table lists various events with details like date, country, athlete name, discipline, event, and medal type (gold, silver, bronze). Each row represents a single medal won by an athlete in a specific event.\n\nI'll go through each row of the data to count how many times Michael Phelps appears as the winner and do the same for Larisa Latynina. \n\nStarting with Michael Phelps:\n- Row 18: Medalist is Michael Phelps, swimming, 200m butterfly, gold (s).\nWait, the medal column has 's' which I think stands for silver, but in row 18 it's \"floor exercise g\" and then under \"medalist\", it's Larisa. Wait no, looking back:\n\nWait, I need to clarify: Each row has a medalist, country, discipline, event, and medal type (g=gold, s=silver, b=bronze). So for each row where the athlete is Michael Phelps, we count their medals.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nRows 18-22 are about Larisa Latynina. Wait no, rows 18 onwards mention Michael Phelps starting from row 18?\n\nWait let me list out all the medalists and their medals:\n\n- Row 0: John Doe (example), but in our actual data, looking at each row's \"medalist\":\n\nLooking through the provided JSON data:\n\nRows where medalist is Michael Phelps:\n- Row 18: medalist is Edoardo Mangiarotti? Wait no. Let me check each row:\n\nWait I think I made a mistake earlier because the initial data given in the JSON seems to have rows that are about different athletes. For example, rows towards the end mention Michael Phelps.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow indices go from 0 to 22 (since there are 23 rows). Let's check each row for \"medalist\" being either Michael Phelps or Larisa Latynina.\n\nRows where medalist is Michael Phelps:\n- Row 18: \"michael phelps\", swimming, 200m butterfly, s (silver)\n- Row 19: \"michael phelps\", swimming, 4x200m freestyle, g (gold)\n- Row 20: \"michael phelps\", swimming, 200m individual medley, g (gold)\n- Row 21: \"michael phelps\", swimming, 100m butterfly, g (gold)\n- Row 22: \"michael phelps\", swimming, 4x100m medley relay, g (gold)\n\nSo that's 5 medals for Michael Phelps.\n\nNow checking for Larisa Latynina:\n\nRows where medalist is Larisa Latynina:\n- Row 13: \"larisa latynina\", gymnastics, team event, g\n- Row 14: \"larisa latynina\", gymnastics, all-around, s\n- Row 15: \"larisa latynina\", gymnastics, vault, s\n- Row 16: \"larisa latynina\", gymnastics, uneven bars, b\n- Row 17: \"larisa latynina\", gymnastics, balance beam, b\n- Row 18: Wait no, row 18 is about Michael Phelps.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: John Doe (example)\nRow 13: Larisa Latynina, team foil, s? No, looking at the actual data:\n\nWait in the provided JSON, rows are as follows. Let's parse them correctly.\n\nActually, the medalist names in the table vary. Let me go through each row from index 0 to 22 and note when it's Michael Phelps or Larisa Latynina.\n\nRow indices with \"medalist\" as Michael Phelps:\n- Row 18: Yes, Michael Phelps\n- Rows 19, 20, 21, 22 also have him.\n\nSo that's rows 18 to 22 (inclusive), which is 5 medals.\n\nFor Larisa Latynina:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow indices where medalist is Larisa Latynina:\n- Row 13: Larisa Latynina\n- Row 14: Yes\n- Row 15: Yes\n- Row 16: Yes\n- Row 17: Yes\n\nWait, that's rows 13 to 17. So each of those is a separate medal.\n\nRow 13: Larisa Latynina in team gymnastics, gold (g)\nRow 14: All-around, silver (s)\nRow 15: Vault, silver (s)\nRow 16: Uneven bars, bronze (b)\nRow 17: Balance beam, bronze (b)\n\nSo that's a total of 5 medals as well.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made an error because the data may include multiple medals per athlete in different events. Let me recount carefully:\n\nLooking at each row from 0 to 22:\n\nRow 13: Larisa Latynina (gymnastics, team event) - gold\nRow 14: Larisa Latynina (all-around) - silver\nRow 15: Larisa Latynina (vault) - silver\nRow 16: Larisa Latynina (uneven bars) - bronze\nRow 17: Larisa Latynina (balance beam) - bronze\n\nSo that's 5 medals for Larisa.\n\nMichael Phelps has rows:\n\nRow 18: Silver in 200m butterfly\nRow 19: Gold in 4x200m freestyle\nRow 20: Gold in 200m individual medley\nRow 21: Gold in 100m butterfly\nRow 22: Gold in 4x100m medley relay\n\nSo that's also 5 medals.\n\nWait, but the claim is whether Michael has less than Larisa. If both have 5, then the claim would be false. However, perhaps I'm missing some rows where Larisa has more medals.\n\nLet me double-check all rows for Larisa:\n\nLooking from row 0 to 22:\n\n- Row 13: Yes\n- Row 14: Yes\n- Row 15: Yes\n- Row 16: Yes\n- Row 17: Yes\n\nNo other rows mention her. So 5 medals.\n\nMichael has 5 as well, so the claim is false because he doesn't have less; they have the same number.\n\nWait, but perhaps I missed some rows where Michael has more medals. Let me recount his rows:\n\nRows 18-22: That's 5 rows, each with a medal for him.\n\nSo total medals:\n\nMichael: 5\nLarisa: 5\n\nTherefore, the claim that Michael has less than Larisa is false because they have equal numbers.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread some rows. Let me check again to ensure accuracy.\n\nLooking through all rows where medalist is either of them:\n\nFor Larisa Latynina:\n\n- Row 13: Gold\n- Row 14: Silver\n- Row 15: Silver\n- Row 16: Bronze\n- Row 17: Bronze\n\nTotal: 5 medals.\n\nFor Michael Phelps:\n\n- Row 18: Silver\n- Row 19: Gold\n- Row 20: Gold\n- Row 21: Gold\n- Row 22: Gold\n\nSo that's also 5 medals. Therefore, the claim is false because Michael does not have fewer medals than Larisa; they have the same number.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"Michael Phelps has less medal than Larisa Latynina\" is **false**.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** \n   - Scan through each row of the table to find entries where the medalist is either Michael Phelps or Larisa Latynina.\n\n2. **Count Medals for Each Athlete:**\n   - **Larisa Latynina:**\n     - Row 13: Gold\n     - Row 14: Silver\n     - Row 15: Silver\n     - Row 16: Bronze\n     - Row 17: Bronze\n     - Total: 5 medals.\n   \n   - **Michael Phelps:**\n     - Row 18: Silver\n     - Row 19: Gold\n     - Row 20: Gold\n     - Row 21: Gold\n     - Row 22: Gold\n     - Total: 5 medals.\n\n3. **Compare Medal Counts:**\n   - Both athletes have 5 medals each.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since both have the same number of medals, Michael Phelps does not have fewer medals than Larisa Latynina. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** False",

The claim is that \"robert garrett and james connolly both represent different country.\" I need to verify if this is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the data to find entries for Robert Garrett and James Connolly. Scanning the table rows, I notice row 1 mentions Robert Garrett with \"country\": \"united states\". Then, in row 2, there's an entry for James Connolly, also from \"united states\".\n\nWait a minute, both are listed as representing the same country. That means they don't represent different countries. So, the claim is incorrect.\n\nTo support this, I need to identify the relevant cells. For Robert Garrett, it's row 1 under the \"country\" column. Similarly, for James Connolly, it's row 2 under the same column.\n\nSo, both are from the United States, making the claim false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The data seems to be in rows with columns like row_index (which probably represents the order), athlete's name, country, sport, and event along with a medal type (like gold, silver, bronze). \n\nThe claim is that no athletes received medals in gymnastics. So, I need to check if there are any entries where the sport is gymnastics and there's a medal awarded.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 2: Sport is Fencing, so not relevant.\nRow 13: Sport is Gymnastics. There's a medal type 'g' which stands for gold. So this athlete received a gold medal in gymnastics.\nSimilarly, rows 14 to 18 also have sport as Gymnastics and different medals (s for silver, b for bronze). \n\nWait, the claim says none received medals, but we have multiple entries with sport gymnastics and medals. So the claim is false.\n\nNow, I need to list all relevant cells that show athletes who did receive medals in gymnastics. That includes rows 13 through 20 (I think) because each has 'gymnastics' as the sport and a medal type.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because there are definitely athletes with gymnastics medals.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Sport\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Sport\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Sport\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Sport\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Sport\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Sport\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Sport\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the table and check if any of them mention the event \"pommel horse.\" The claim is saying that no athletes received medals for this specific event, so my task is to see if there are any entries where the Event column has \"pommel horse.\"\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nRow 0: Event is \"Fencing\".
