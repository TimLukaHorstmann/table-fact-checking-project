    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a claim is true or false based on a given table in JSON format. The claim is: \"adelaide united play in front of 25039 crowd at adelaide oval.\" \n\nFirst, I'll parse the JSON data provided. The table has several columns: round, date, home team, score, away team, crowd, stadium, and match details. There are 21 rows of data.\n\nMy task is to check if there's a row where Adelaide United played at Adelaide Oval in front of a crowd of 25039 people. \n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to find any mention of Adelaide Oval as the stadium. Looking through the \"stadium\" column:\n\n- Row 0: Suncorp Stadium\n- Row 1: Sydney Football Stadium\n- Row 2: Hindmarsh Stadium\n- Row 3: EnergyAustralia Stadium\n- Row 4: Westpac Stadium\n- Row 5: Hindmarsh Stadium\n- Row 6: Members Equity Stadium\n- Row 7: Hindmarsh Stadium\n- Row 8: Sydney Football Stadium\n- Row 9: Hindmarsh Stadium\n- Row 10: Hindmarsh Stadium\n- Row 11: Telstra Dome\n- Row 12: Hindmarsh Stadium\n- Row 13: Hindmarsh Stadium\n- Row 14: Westpac Stadium\n- Row 15: Telstra Dome\n- Row 16: Hindmarsh Stadium\n- Row 17: Adelaide Oval (This is the row I'm interested in)\n- Row 18: EnergyAustralia Stadium\n- Row 19: Members Equity Stadium\n- Row 20: Hindmarsh Stadium\n\nSo, the only row with Adelaide Oval as the stadium is row index 17.\n\nNow, checking the details of row 17:\n- Home team: Adelaide United (since it's listed under \"home team\")\n- Crowd size: 25039\n- Stadium: Adelaide Oval\n\nThis matches exactly with the claim. The home team is Adelaide United, the crowd was 25039, and they played at Adelaide Oval.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true. I'll note the relevant cells from this row: \"crowd\" (value 25039) and \"stadium\" (Adelaide Oval). Both are in row index 17.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"sydney fc play at adelaide oval\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for instances where Sydney FC is either the home team or away team and see if Adelaide Oval is their stadium.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: Queensland Roar vs Adelaide United at Suncorp Stadium.\nRow 1: Sydney FC as home team at Sydney Football Stadium.\nRow 2: Adelaide United vs Melbourne Victory at Hindmarsh Stadium.\nRow 3: Newcastle Jets vs Adelaide United at EnergyAustralia Stadium.\nRow 4: Wellington Phoenix vs Adelaide United at Westpac Stadium.\nRow 5: Adelaide United vs Central Coast Mariners at Hindmarsh Stadium.\nRow 6: Perth Glory vs Adelaide United at Members Equity Stadium.\nRow 7: Adelaide United vs Melbourne Victory at Hindmarsh Stadium.\nRow 8: Sydney FC as away team against Adelaide United at Sydney Football Stadium.\nRow 9: Adelaide United vs Wellington Phoenix at Hindmarsh Stadium.\nRow 10: Adelaide United vs Queensland Roar at Hindmarsh Stadium.\nRow 11: Central Coast Mariners vs Adelaide United at Bluetongue Stadium.\nRow 12: Adelaide United vs Newcastle Jets at Hindmarsh Stadium.\nRow 13: Adelaide United vs Perth Glory at Hindmarsh Stadium.\nRow 14: Wellington Phoenix vs Adelaide United at Westpac Stadium.\nRow 15: Melbourne Victory vs Adelaide United at Telstra Dome.\nRow 16: Adelaide United vs Central Coast Mariners at Hindmarsh Stadium.\nRow 17: Adelaide United as home team against Sydney FC at Adelaide Oval. Wait, here in row 17, the home team is Adelaide United and the away team is Sydney FC. The stadium is Adelaide Oval.\n\nSo, in row 17, Sydney FC is playing at Adelaide Oval as an away team. This means they are playing a match there, even though it's not their home stadium. \n\nTherefore, the claim that \"Sydney FC play at Adelaide Oval\" is supported by this instance where they played an away game there.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cell showing Sydney FC playing at Adelaide Oval is in row 17 under 'Stadium'.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Stadium\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format. The claim is: \"adelaide united play in front of 10256 crowd in hindmarsh stadium on november 18\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim to check each part against the table data.\n\nThe claim mentions three main points:\n1. The team involved is Adelaide United.\n2. They played in front of a crowd of 10,256 people.\n3. The match was held at Hindmarsh Stadium on November 18.\n\nI'll go through each point step by step.\n\nStarting with the date: the claim specifies \"november 18\". Looking at the table data, I need to find which row has a date that matches this. Scanning through the dates in the 'date' column:\n- Round 13 is on November 18, 2007.\n\nNext, checking the stadium: The claim says Hindmarsh Stadium. For round 13, under the 'stadium' column, it's indeed listed as \"hindmarsh stadium\". So that matches.\n\nNow, verifying the crowd size: According to the table, the 'crowd' is 10256 for this match. That aligns with the claim of a 10,256 crowd.\n\nAdditionally, Adelaide United is mentioned in both the 'home_team' and 'away_team' columns for that row. The home team is Adelaide United, so they were playing at Hindmarsh Stadium as per the data.\n\nPutting it all together:\n- Date: November 18 (matches round 13)\n- Stadium: Hindmarsh (correct for that match)\n- Crowd size: 10256 (exact number in the table)\n\nAll components of the claim are supported by the data. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to list the relevant cells that were checked:\n- Row index 12 (since indexing starts at 0) for 'date'\n- Same row for 'stadium' and 'crowd'\n\nSo the relevant cells are in row 12 across these columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data. The match on November 18, 2007, at Hindmarsh Stadium had a crowd of 10,256 with Adelaide United playing as the home team.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
