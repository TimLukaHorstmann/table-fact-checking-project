    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's see what I need to do here. The user has given me a table in JSON format and a claim they want me to verify as either TRUE or FALSE. My task is to check each condition in the claim against the table and determine if it's supported.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. The claim is: \"there be no game that be play on october 30 1977 that be list greater than week 7.\" Hmm, the wording is a bit old-fashioned or maybe not standard English, but I think I get what they're saying.\n\nBreaking down the claim: It's stating that there should be no game played on October 30, 1977, which is listed in a week number greater than 7. So, I need to check two things for each row in the table:\n\n1. The date of the game.\n2. The week number.\n\nIf any row has both the date as October 30, 1977 and a week number greater than 7, then the claim is FALSE. Otherwise, it's TRUE.\n\nLooking at the JSON structure, the columns are \"week\", \"date\", \"opponent\", \"result\", and \"attendance\". The data is an array of arrays where each inner array represents a row with values corresponding to these columns.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 0: Week 1, Date September 19, 1977. Not relevant because the date isn't October 30.\nRow 1: Week 2, Date September 25, 1977. Again, not the target date.\nRow 2: Week 3, Date October 2, 1977. Still before October 30.\nRow 3: Week 4, Date October 9, 1977. Closer but not there yet.\nRow 4: Week 5, Date October 16, 1977. Getting closer to the target date.\nRow 5: Week 6, Date October 23, 1977. Still before October 30.\nRow 6: Week 7, Date October 30, 1977. This is the exact date mentioned in the claim. Now, checking the week number here\u2014it's week 7. The claim says \"greater than week 7,\" so this doesn't meet that condition.\n\nContinuing to see if any other rows might match:\n\nRow 7: Week 8, Date November 6, 1977.\nRow 8: Week 9, Date November 13, 1977.\nRow 9: Week 10, Date November 20, 1977.\nRow 10: Week 11, Date November 27, 1977.\nRow 11: Week 12, Date December 4, 1977.\nRow 12: Week 13, Date December 12, 1977.\nRow 13: Week 14, Date December 18, 1977.\n\nNone of these have the date October 30, 1977. The only row with that specific date is week 7, which doesn't satisfy \"greater than week 7.\"\n\nSo, there are no games played on October 30, 1977, in weeks higher than 7. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n\nTo structure my answer as per instructions: I need to provide a JSON object with the answer and relevant cells. The relevant cells here would be the row where the date is October 30, 1977, which is row index 6. The columns involved are \"date\" and \"week\".\n\nI think that's all. No other rows meet both conditions, so the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
