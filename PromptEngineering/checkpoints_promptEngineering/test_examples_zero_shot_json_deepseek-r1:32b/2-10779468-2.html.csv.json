    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"the texas longhorns woman's basketball table show game vs different team show score on different location\". \n\nFirst, let me break down what this claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that in the table provided (which I assume refers to Texas Longhorns women's basketball), each row shows a game against a different team and also displays the scores at different locations.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are: \"texas vs\", \"overall record\", \"austin\", \"opponent's venue\", \"neutral site\", \"last 5 meetings\", \"last 10 meetings\", \"current streak\". The rows list various opponents like Baylor, Colorado, etc., and under each column, there are records that seem to indicate the outcomes of games. For example, in the first row under \"austin\" it says \"ut, 27-5\".\n\nThe claim mentions that for each game against a different team, the score is shown on different locations. So I think this means that for each opponent, there are scores recorded for games played at Austin (UT's home), the opponent's venue, and neutral sites.\n\nLooking through the data:\n- Each row represents a different team Texas has played against.\n- For each of these teams, there are entries under \"austin\", \"opponent's venue\", and \"neutral site\" which show scores like \"ut 27-5\" or \"bu 3-2\".\n\nThis indicates that for each opponent, the table does indeed show scores from games played in different locations (Austin, opponent's place, neutral). Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nI should now identify which cells are relevant to this conclusion. For each row, the columns \"austin\", \"opponent's venue\", and \"neutral site\" contain the scores for different game locations against each team. So I'll note these columns across all rows as they support the claim that scores vary by location per opponent.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows Texas Longhorns women's basketball games against various teams, with scores recorded at Austin, opponents' venues, and neutral sites for each team.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"austin\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent's venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"neutral site\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"austin\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent's venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"neutral site\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the current streak of l 2 be the score with baylor , iowa state , nebraska and oklahoma state.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's saying that the teams Baylor, Iowa State, Nebraska, and Oklahoma State all have a current streak of \"l 2.\" In sports, a current streak typically refers to consecutive wins or losses. The notation \"l 2\" likely stands for two consecutive losses.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different opponent that UT has played against. The columns include details like the overall record, games in Austin, opponent's venue, neutral site, last 5 and 10 meetings, and the current streak.\n\nI need to check the \"current streak\" column for each of the specified teams: Baylor, Iowa State, Nebraska, and Oklahoma State. \n\nStarting with Baylor:\n- Row index 0 (since JSON arrays are zero-indexed), the opponent is Baylor.\n- The \"current streak\" is listed as \"l 2\". This matches the claim.\n\nNext, Iowa State:\n- Looking through the data array, the third entry is for \"iowa state\".\n- Its current streak is also \"l 2\".\n\nThen, Nebraska:\n- Scanning down, the sixth row (index 5) is for Nebraska.\n- The current streak here is \"l 2\" as well.\n\nFinally, Oklahoma State:\n- The ninth row (index 8) is for Oklahoma State.\n- Their current streak is listed as \"l 2\".\n\nSo all four teams mentioned in the claim have a current streak of \"l 2\". This means the claim accurately reflects the data in the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nI'll list each relevant cell to support this conclusion, including their row indices and the column name.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly identifies that Baylor, Iowa State, Nebraska, and Oklahoma State all have a current streak of \"l 2\" based on the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"current streak\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"current streak\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"current streak\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"current streak\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me carefully analyze the claim and cross-check it with the data in the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"in the last 10 meeting, the score be tie, 5-5 four times and two times at ut, 8-2.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down what this means. The claim is making two points about the last 10 meetings:\n\n1. There are four instances where the score was tied at 5-5.\n2. There are two instances where UT scored 8-2.\n\nI need to check each row in the table's \"last 10 meetings\" column (which is one of the columns) to see if these conditions hold.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are:\n0: texas vs\n1: overall record\n2: austin\n3: opponent 's venue\n4: neutral site\n5: last 5 meetings\n6: last 10 meetings\n7: current streak\n\nSo, I'm focusing on column index 6 (\"last 10 meetings\") for each row.\n\nNow, let's go through each team:\n\n1. Baylor:\n   - Last 10 meetings: \"tied, 5-5\"\n   - So, one tie at 5-5.\n\n2. Colorado:\n   - Last 10 meetings: \"ut, 8-2\"\n   - This is an instance where UT won 8-2.\n\n3. Iowa State:\n   - Last 10 meetings: \"tied, 5-5\"\n   - Another tie at 5-5.\n\n4. Kansas:\n   - Last 10 meetings: \"ut,7-3\"\n   - Not relevant for the claim.\n\n5. Kansas State:\n   - Last 10 meetings: \"ksu,6-4\"\n   - Doesn't match either condition.\n\n6. Missouri:\n   - Last 10 meetings: \"ut,9-1\"\n   - Doesn't fit either point in the claim.\n\n7. Nebraska:\n   - Last 10 meetings: \"ut,8-2\"\n   - Another instance where UT won 8-2.\n\n8. Oklahoma:\n   - Last 10 meetings: \"tied,5-5\"\n   - Third tie at 5-5.\n\n9. Oklahoma State:\n   - Last 10 meetings: \"ut,7-3\"\n   - Not relevant.\n\n10. Texas A&M:\n    - Last 10 meetings: \"tied,5-5\"\n    - Fourth tie at 5-5.\n\n11. Texas Tech:\n    - Last 10 meetings: \"ttu,6-4\"\n    - Doesn't match either condition.\n\nNow, let's tally up:\n\nTies at 5-5: Baylor, Iowa State, Oklahoma, Texas A&M \u2013 that's four instances. So the first part of the claim is correct.\n\nUT wins with 8-2: Colorado and Nebraska \u2013 that's two instances. The second part also matches.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table.

The claim states: \"ut , 6 - 2 be the result on the game at austin , texas v iowa state and kansa state\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It seems to be saying that in games where Texas (UT) plays against Iowa State and Kansas State in Austin, the result was UT 6-2 each time.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are: \"texas vs\", \"overall record\", \"austin\", \"opponent 's venue\", \"neutral site\", \"last 5 meetings\", \"last 10 meetings\", \"current streak\".

So in Austin against Iowa State, UT has a 6-2 record.\n4. **Kansas (row index 3)**: Opponent is Kansas, not relevant.\n5. **Kansas State (row index 4)**: Looking at \"austin\" column here.

The claim states: \"at opponent's venue, the score be tie on 2 game, tie, 4-4 against Kansas and tie, 7-7 against Oklahoma.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse the claim correctly. It seems like it's saying that at the opponent's venue, there were two games where the scores tied: one with Kansas as a 4-4 tie and another with Oklahoma as a 7-7 tie.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see the columns are:\n1. texas vs\n2. overall record\n3. austin\n4. opponent's venue\n5. neutral site\n6. last 5 meetings\n7. last 10 meetings\n8. current streak\n\nThe relevant column for this claim is \"opponent's venue\" since it mentions that the games were at the opponent's venue.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to check if there are any ties in the \"opponent's venue\" column.\n\nLet me list out each team and their corresponding \"opponent's venue\" record:\n\n1. Baylor: ut, 22-13 \u2192 Not a tie.\n2. Colorado: ut, 6-2 \u2192 Not a tie.\n3. Iowa State: isu,5-2 \u2192 Not a tie.\n4. Kansas: tied,4-4 \u2192 This is a tie at the opponent's venue (Kansas). So that's one tie.\n5. Kansas State: ksu,4-3 \u2192 Not a tie.\n6. Missouri: ut,5-1 \u2192 Not a tie.\n7. Nebraska: ut,4-3 \u2192 Not a tie.\n8. Oklahoma: tied,7-7 \u2192 This is another tie at the opponent's venue (Oklahoma). So that's the second tie.\n9. Oklahoma State: osu,3-2 \u2192 Wait, looking back, in \"opponent's venue\" for Oklahoma State it's ut,7-4? No, wait the row for Oklahoma State is:\n\nWait, let me check each row correctly.\n\nLooking at the data array:\n\nRow 0: Baylor\n- opponent's venue: ut,22-13 \u2192 UT (Texas) has a higher score; not a tie.\n\nRow 1: Colorado\n- opponent's venue: ut,6-2 \u2192 Not a tie.\n\nRow 2: Iowa State\n- opponent's venue: isu,5-2 \u2192 Opponent's venue is ISU, and the score is 5-2 in their favor. So not a tie for UT.\n\nRow 3: Kansas\n- opponent's venue: tied,4-4 \u2192 This is a tie at KU (Kansas) venue. So that's one tie.\n\nRow 4: Kansas State\n- opponent's venue: ksu,4-3 \u2192 Not a tie.\n\nRow 5: Missouri\n- opponent's venue: ut,5-1 \u2192 Not a tie.\n\nRow 6: Nebraska\n- opponent's venue: ut,4-3 \u2192 Not a tie.\n\nRow 7: Oklahoma\n- opponent's venue: tied,7-7 \u2192 This is a tie at OU (Oklahoma) venue. So that's the second tie.\n\nRow 8: Oklahoma State\nWait, no, let me count again because there are 10 rows in data:\n\nLooking back, the data array has 11 entries (indices 0 to 10). Let me list each:\n\n- Row 0: Baylor \u2192 opponent venue: ut,22-13 \u2192 not tie.\n- Row 1: Colorado \u2192 opponent venue: ut,6-2 \u2192 no.\n- Row 2: Iowa State \u2192 isu,5-2 \u2192 score in their favor; not a tie for UT.\n- Row 3: Kansas \u2192 tied,4-4 \u2192 yes, one tie.\n- Row 4: Kansas State \u2192 ksu,4-3 \u2192 opponent's venue is KSU, and the record is 4-3. So UT lost here, but it's not a tie.\n- Row 5: Missouri \u2192 ut,5-1 \u2192 nope.\n- Row 6: Nebraska \u2192 ut,4-3 \u2192 nope.\n- Row 7: Oklahoma \u2192 tied,7-7 \u2192 yes, that's the second tie.\n- Row 8: Oklahoma State \u2192 opponent venue is OSU? Wait, in their row, opponent's venue is osu,3-2. So the score is UT vs OSU at OSU's place, with a record of 3-2 for UT? Or does it mean that when playing at OSU, UT has 3 wins and 2 losses? I think so. But in this context, the claim says the scores were tied, like in individual games.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The \"opponent's venue\" column shows records, not specific game outcomes. So each cell is a record of how many times UT won vs lost at that opponent's venue. For example, for Kansas, it's tied 4-4, meaning they have 4 wins and 4 losses when playing at Kansas' venue.\n\nSo the claim says there were two games where the score was a tie: one against Kansas as 4-4, and another against Oklahoma as 7-7. Wait, that can't be right because those are overall records, not individual game scores.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the table. Let me re-examine the structure.\n\nEach row represents a different opponent (e.g., Baylor, Colorado, etc.). Each column shows performance in different contexts:\n\n- Column 2: Overall record against that team.\n- Column 3: Record when playing at Austin (UT's home).\n- Column 4: Record when playing at the opponent's venue.\n- Column 5: Neutral site games.\n\nSo for each team, Column 4 is the number of wins and losses when UT played at that team's venue. So a \"tied\" score would mean equal wins and losses in those matchups at the opponent's place.\n\nLooking back:\n\nFor Kansas (row index 3), the \"opponent's venue\" is \"tied,4-4\". That means in games played at Kansas' venue, UT has 4 wins and 4 losses\u2014so overall, it's a tie in terms of records, not individual game scores.\n\nSimilarly, for Oklahoma (row index 7), \"opponent's venue\" is \"tied,7-7\", meaning 7 wins and 7 losses when playing at OU's stadium.\n\nWait, but the claim says: \"the score be tie on 2 game, tie,4-4 against Kansas and tie,7-7 against Oklahoma.\" That seems to refer to specific games where the scores were tied (like a game ending in a tie), not the overall record being equal. So perhaps there's confusion here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is referring to the overall records being tied at those venues, meaning UT has an equal number of wins and losses when playing at Kansas and Oklahoma's venues.\n\nIf that's the case, then looking at the table:\n\n- For Kansas (row 3), opponent's venue: \"tied,4-4\" \u2192 yes.\n- For Oklahoma (row 7), opponent's venue: \"tied,7-7\" \u2192 yes.\n\nSo both teams have tied records in their respective home venues against UT. Therefore, the claim is correct because there are two such cases where UT has a tied record at the opponent's venue: one with Kansas and another with Oklahoma.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim refers to specific games ending in ties, then perhaps this isn't captured in the table, as the columns show overall records rather than individual game outcomes. So without more data on specific game scores, we can only verify that UT has tied series at those venues, not specific tied games.\n\nAssuming the first interpretation (tied records), then yes, there are two instances where UT's record is tied in their opponent's home games: against Kansas and Oklahoma.\n\nSo the answer would be to confirm that there are two opponents where UT has a tied record when playing away\u2014Kansas with 4-4 and Oklahoma with 7-7.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to two instances where the University of Texas (UT) has a tied record in their opponent's home venues. Specifically, against Kansas, UT has a record of 4 wins and 4 losses, and against Oklahoma, they have a record of 7 wins and 7 losses when playing at those opponents' venues. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure:** Each row represents an opponent, with columns showing overall records, home performance (Austin), away performance (opponent's venue), and neutral site games.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data Points:**\n   - For Kansas (row index 3), \"opponent's venue\" is listed as \"tied,4-4.\"\n   - For Oklahoma (row index 7), \"opponent's venue\" is listed as \"tied,7-7.\"\n\n3. **Interpretation:** These entries indicate that UT has an equal number of wins and losses when playing at these opponents' venues.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** The claim is accurate based on the provided data, showing two instances where UT's record at the opponent's venue is tied.\n\n**Answer:**\nYes, there are two instances where UT has a tied record in their away games: against Kansas with a 4-4 record and against Oklahoma with a 7-7 record.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the current streak of l 2 be the score with only baylor.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part means. \"Current streak\" refers to the last column in the table, which shows things like \"l 2\" or \"w 1\". These likely stand for losing (l) or winning (w) streaks of a certain number of games. So \"l 2\" would mean they've lost their last two games.\n\nThe claim is saying that only Baylor has a current streak of l 2, and that this corresponds to the score being... well, I'm not entirely sure what \"be the score with only baylor\" means here. Maybe it's pointing out that Baylor is the only team with an l 2 streak? Or perhaps it's about their scores related to that streak.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different opponent that UT has played against. The columns include details like overall record, games in Austin, opponent's venue, neutral site, last 5 and 10 meetings, and current streak.\n\nLet me look through each row to check for \"l 2\" in the current streak column:\n\n- Baylor: Current streak is \"l 2\"\n- Colorado: \"w 1\"\n- Iowa State: \"l 2\"\n- Kansas: \"w 1\"\n- Kansas State: \"l 1\"\n- Missouri: \"w 8\"\n- Nebraska: \"l 2\"\n- Oklahoma: \"w 1\"\n- Oklahoma State: \"l 2\"\n- Texas A&M: \"l 3\"\n- Texas Tech: \"w 2\"\n\nSo, looking at the current streak column, I see that multiple teams have an l 2 streak: Baylor (row 0), Iowa State (row 2), Nebraska (row 6), and Oklahoma State (row 8). That's four teams with a losing streak of two games.\n\nThe claim says \"only baylor\" has this current streak. But since there are other teams listed with the same streak, that makes the claim FALSE.\n\nSo, I need to note which rows have the \"l 2\" streak and see if it's only Baylor or not. Since it's not only Baylor, the relevant cells would include all these instances where \"current streak\" is l 2.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that only Baylor has a current streak of \"l 2\", but upon reviewing the table, multiple teams have this streak.

It seems like the claim is saying that in the Texas Longhorns women's basketball table, there's a game against only one team where the score was shown at a different location.\n\nLooking at the JSON structure of the table, the columns are: \"texas vs\", \"overall record\", \"austin\", \"opponent's venue\", \"neutral site\", \"last 5 meetings\", \"last 10 meetings\", and \"current streak\". Each row represents a game against a specific team, like Baylor, Colorado, etc.\n\nThe claim mentions that there's only one team where the score was shown at a different location. So I need to check each row under the columns related to location: \"austin\" (which is UT\u2019s home), \"opponent's venue\", and \"neutral site\". \n\nFor each opponent, I'll check if the game was played at a neutral site or at the opponent's venue instead of Austin.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Baylor**: The columns for location are \"austin\": \"ut 27-5\" (so UT won at home), \"opponent's venue\": \"ut 22-13\", and \"neutral site\": \"ut 7-2\". So multiple games were played at different locations, but the specific game mentioned in the claim isn't clear here. \n\nWait, actually, each row seems to represent an opponent, and under \"austin\" it shows UT's record when playing against them in Austin. But I think I need to look for whether any of these opponents have a neutral site or opponent\u2019s venue as their location.\n\nLooking at the columns: For each team, under \"neutral site\", if it's not tied, that means some games were played there. Similarly, \"opponent's venue\" indicates games played away from Austin.\n\nThe claim is about only one game where the score was shown at a different location. So I'm thinking maybe looking for how many opponents have games either in their own venue or neutral sites. But perhaps the claim refers to whether all games are at Austin except one, but that doesn't seem right because most teams would have played some away games.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is about whether there's only one team where all their meetings were at a different location than Austin. For example, if against Baylor, all games were either at opponent's venue or neutral site, not in Austin. But looking at Baylor's row: \"austin\" is \"ut 27-5\", which suggests UT won when playing at home, so there are games in Austin.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to whether only one team has a game that was played at a different location (opponent's or neutral) and not in Austin. So we need to check if for all teams except one, their meetings were entirely in Austin, but for one team, some games were elsewhere.\n\nBut looking through each row:\n\n- **Baylor**: \"neutral site\" has \"ut 7-2\", so they played at a neutral site.\n- **Colorado**: Neutral site shows \"ut 3-0\".\n- **Texas Tech**: \"neutral site\": \"ttu 3-2\", so games were at TTU's place.\n\nWait, but the claim says only one team has scores shown on different locations. So perhaps there is only one opponent where all their meetings are either at their venue or neutral, not in Austin. But looking through each row, most have some games outside Austin.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it refers to having a game at both opponent's and neutral sites for only one team. For example, if against Texas Tech, they played some at TTU (opponent's venue) and some at neutral site, but I think the columns are cumulative records.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider that the claim is saying in the table, there is only one game where the location was different from Austin. So, checking each opponent's \"austin\" column: it shows how many times UT played at home against them and won or lost. Then under \"opponent's venue\", how many times they played away, etc.\n\nIf the claim is that only one team has a game listed in locations other than Austin, then I need to see if all but one of the opponents have all their games in Austin (i.e., only \"austin\" column has data, others are zero or not present), but that's not the case here because most teams have data in multiple location columns.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: The claim might be suggesting that there is only one row where the game was played at a different location. But looking at each opponent, many rows have data under \"opponent's venue\" or \"neutral site\", indicating games were played elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to only one team having their games recorded as being in a different location, meaning that for all other teams, UT played them only in Austin. That doesn't seem correct because, for example, Texas Tech has data under \"opponent's venue\" (\"ttu 3-2\") and \"neutral site\" (\"ttu 6-4\"), indicating multiple locations.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure of the table. Each row might be showing the overall records against each opponent across different locations. So for example, against Baylor, UT has a total record of 58-15 when playing in Austin (since \"austin\" is part of that). But maybe the claim refers to only one team having their games played outside Austin.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count how many opponents have games recorded at locations other than Austin. For each row:\n\n1. **Baylor**: Neutral site has 7-2, so yes.\n2. **Colorado**: Neutral site 3-0, so yes.\n3. **Texas Tech**: Opponent's venue and neutral site both have data, so yes.\n\nLooking through all rows, I see that most opponents have games played outside Austin. The only team without any away or neutral games would be if their \"opponent's venue\" and \"neutral site\" are zero or not applicable. But looking at the table:\n\n- **Baylor**: \"austin\": 58-15, \"opponent's venue\": 23-8, \"neutral site\":7-3.\nWait no, that doesn't seem right because each row is per opponent. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me re-examine the table structure.\n\nLooking at the first row (Baylor):\n\n- Column \"texas vs\": Baylor\n- \"overall record\": 58-15 (probably overall against Baylor)\n- \"austin\": 28-4 (UT's record when playing Baylor in Austin)\n- \"opponent's venue\": 23-8 (UT's record when playing Baylor at Baylor\u2019s place)\n- \"neutral site\":7-3\n\nSo for each opponent, the table shows how many times UT has won/lost against them in Austin, at the opponent's place, and neutral sites.\n\nThe claim says that only one team has their game(s) shown on a different location. So perhaps it means that only one of these opponents had all their games played outside Austin? Or that for only one team, there is data under \"opponent's venue\" or \"neutral site\", but not both.\n\nWait, the claim is a bit unclear. It says: \"show game vs only 1 team show score on different location.\" So perhaps in the table, for all teams except one, their games are only shown in Austin, and only one team has games recorded at different locations.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- **Baylor**: Has games in Austin, opponent's venue, and neutral. So multiple locations.\n- **Colorado**: Neutral site 3-0; no data under \"opponent's venue\" (I think it's not listed), but probably they have games elsewhere too.\nWait, actually looking back at the table:\n\nEach row lists for each opponent: overall record, austin record, opponent's venue record, neutral site record.\n\nSo all opponents except maybe one have multiple locations. But in reality, most teams play against each other both home and away.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the claim is that only one team has their games listed as being played outside Austin, i.e., only for one opponent do we have data under \"opponent's venue\" or \"neutral site\".\n\nBut looking at the table:\n\n- **Baylor**: Played in Austin, at Baylor, and neutral.\n- **Colorado**: Neutral site 3-0, no data in opponent's venue (maybe they don't play there).\nWait, perhaps not. It might be that for each team, all possible locations are listed, even if zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table shows cumulative records, so some teams have games only at certain venues.\n\nBut regardless, it seems like multiple teams have games recorded in different locations, so the claim that only one team has scores shown on different locations is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the original claim was misinterpreted. Maybe the user is saying that in their table, only one team has games played outside Austin, and others are all in Austin. If that's the case, but according to the table data provided earlier, that doesn't seem correct because most teams have multiple venues listed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something else. Let me try to see: perhaps for all opponents except one, UT only plays them in Austin. So only one opponent has games outside Austin. But looking at the data, that's not the case.\n\nWait, let's check each team:\n\n1. **Baylor**: Played in Austin (28-4), at Baylor (23-8), neutral (7-3)\n2. **Colorado**: Played in Austin (20-5), at Colorado (6-2), neutral (3-0)\nWait no, the numbers I'm seeing are different now.\n\nWait, perhaps the table is not complete or I have misread it earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nThe user provided a table with headers: Overall, Austin, Opponent's Venue, Neutral Site.\n\nFor example:\n\n| Opponent      | Overall | Austin | Opponent's Venue | Neutral Site |\n|---------------|---------|--------|------------------|--------------|\n| Baylor        | 58-15   | 28-4   | 23-8             | 7-3          |\n\nSo for each opponent, the overall is UT's record against them in all venues. Austin shows how many times UT won/lost when playing at home (Austin). Opponent's Venue shows how many times they played there and the result. Neutral Site is any neutral games.\n\nTherefore, if a team only has data under Austin and no other columns, it would mean UT only plays them in Austin. But looking through the table:\n\n- **Baylor**: All three locations have data.\n- **Colorado**: Played in Austin (20-5), at Colorado (6-2), neutral (3-0)\n- **Texas Tech**: Austin (14-7), Opponent's Venue (ttu 3-2), Neutral Site (ttu 6-4)\n\nSo, all opponents have games played in multiple locations. Therefore, the claim that only one team has their scores shown on different locations is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps I'm misinterpreting again. Maybe \"different location\" refers to not Austin, so how many teams have games recorded outside Austin. In this case, all teams except maybe one have games elsewhere.\n\nWait, but in the table provided earlier, every opponent has data under \"Opponent's Venue\" or \"Neutral Site\", which implies that they've played UT in locations other than Austin. Therefore, the claim that only one team has their scores shown on different locations is false.\n\nBut perhaps the user made a mistake in the table, and only one team actually plays outside Austin. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that for most teams, their games are only in Austin, except one.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the original answer intended to point out that all opponents have multiple venues listed, so the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that only one team has their scores shown on different locations is incorrect. Upon examining the table, it is evident that each opponent has games recorded across various venues, including Austin, opponent's venues, and neutral sites. Therefore, more than one team plays outside of Austin.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{False}}$",

The claim says: \"ut , 58 - 15 be the result on the game at austin , texas v iowa state and kansa state.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim correctly. It seems like it's stating that UT (the University of Texas) has an overall record of 58-15 against two teams: Iowa State and Kansas State in games played at Austin.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different opponent. The columns include \"texas vs\" which lists the opponent's name, \"overall record,\" \"austin\" (which I assume is UT's record when playing at Austin), among others.\n\nSo, for Iowa State and Kansas State, I need to check their respective rows to see if their overall records match 58-15 at Austin. \n\nLet's start with Iowa State. The row index for Iowa State is 2 (since counting starts from 0). In the \"overall record\" column, it shows \"isu , 10 - 9.\" That doesn't match 58-15. Also, in the \"austin\" column, it's \"ut , 6 - 2,\" which again is not 58-15.\n\nNext, looking at Kansas State. Their row index is 4. The \"overall record\" here is \"ut , 10 - 8.\" Not matching either. In the \"austin\" column, it's \"ut , 6 - 2,\" still doesn't match 58-15.\n\nWait a second, I notice that Texas A&M has an overall record of \"ut , 58  - 15\" in their row (row index 9). That matches the claim. But the claim mentions games against Iowa State and Kansas State. Since those two opponents don't have UT's overall records as 58-15, the claim seems to be incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are from Texas A&M's row where it correctly shows UT's overall record as 58-15, but since the opponents in the claim (Iowa State and Kansas State) don't have this record at Austin, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"overall record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"overall record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim \"at opponent 's venue , the score be tie on only 1 game , 4 - 4 against kansa\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n- It's about games played at the opponent's venue.\n- The score tied in one specific game with a 4-4 result.\n- This tie was against \"kansa,\" which seems to be a misspelling of \"Kansas.\"\n\nNow, looking at the table columns:\n1. **opponent 's venue**: This column should show the records when UT played away games.\n\nNext, I'll scan through each row in the data to find any ties at the opponent's venue against Kansas.\n\n- **Row 0 (Baylor)**: Opponent's venue record is \"ut , 22 -13\" \u2013 no tie mentioned.\n- **Row 1 (Colorado)**: Opponent's venue record is \"ut ,6 -2\" \u2013 again, no ties.\n- **Row 2 (Iowa State)**: Opponent's venue is \"isu ,5 -2\" \u2013 not against Kansas and no tie.\n- **Row 3 (Kansas)**: The opponent's venue column shows \"tied ,4 -4\". This matches the claim of a tied game at their venue with a score of 4-4. So, this seems to support the claim.\n  \nWait, but I should check other rows in case there are more ties against Kansas or others that might invalidate the claim.\n\nContinuing:\n- **Row 4 (Kansas State)**: Opponent's venue is \"ksu ,4 -3\" \u2013 no tie.\n- **Row 5 (Missouri)**: Opponent's venue is \"ut ,5 -1\" \u2013 no tie.\n- **Row 6 (Nebraska)**: Opponent's venue is \"ut ,4 -3\" \u2013 no tie.\n- **Row 7 (Oklahoma)**: Opponent's venue is \"tied ,7 -7\" \u2013 this is a tie but against Oklahoma, not Kansas. So that's another tied game at the opponent's venue.\n- **Row 8 (Oklahoma State)**: Opponent's venue is \"ut ,7 -4\" \u2013 no tie.\n- **Row 9 (Texas A&M)**: Opponent's venue is \"ut ,23 -8\" \u2013 no tie.\n- **Row 10 (Texas Tech)**: Opponent's venue is \"ut ,17 -13\" \u2013 no tie.\n\nSo, I found two instances of tied games at the opponent's venue:\n1. Against Kansas with a 4-4 tie in row 3.\n2. Against Oklahoma with a 7-7 tie in row 7.\n\nThe claim states that there was only one such game (against Kansas). However, since there's another tied game against Oklahoma, the claim isn't fully accurate. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE because the condition of having only one tie at the opponent's venue is not met.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent 's venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent 's venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"In the first 10 meetings, the score be tie, 5-5 four times and two times at UT, 8-2.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this statement means. It seems like it's talking about the outcomes of meetings between Texas (UT) and other opponents. The claim mentions two scenarios:\n\n1. Four times where the score was a tie with a result of 5-5.\n2. Two times where UT won with an 8-2 score.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table to find relevant data. The columns that seem important here are \"last 10 meetings\" and \"overall record.\" These should give me information about past encounters between Texas (UT) and each opponent.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. **Baylor**: Under \"last 10 meetings,\" it says \"tied, 5-5.\" This supports the first part of the claim.\n2. **Colorado**: The last 10 meetings are \"ut, 8-2.\" This matches the second part of the claim where UT wins 8-2.\n3. **Iowa State**: Last 10 meetings are \"tied, 5-5.\" Another instance supporting the first part.\n4. **Kansas**: The last 10 meetings are \"ut, 7-3.\" Doesn't match either scenario.\n5. **Kansas State**: Last 10 meetings show \"ksu, 6-4,\" which doesn't fit. However, the overall record is \"ut,8-2\" in another column, but I'm focusing on last 10 meetings here.\n6. **Missouri**: The last 10 meetings are \"ut,9-1.\" Doesn't match.\n7. **Nebraska**: Last 10 meetings are \"tied,5-5.\" Another tie, so this supports the first part.\n8. **Oklahoma**: Last 10 meetings show \"tied,5-5.\" This is another instance of a tie.\n9. **Oklahoma State**: The last 10 meetings have \"ut,7-3,\" which doesn't fit either scenario.\n10. **Texas A&M**: Under last 10 meetings, it's \"a& m,4-1,\" not matching the claim. However, overall record has \"ut,28-4,\" but again, that's not what we're checking here.\n11. **Texas Tech**: Last 10 meetings are \"ttu,6-4.\" Doesn't fit.\n\nWait a minute, I think I made a mistake in counting the rows. The claim mentions the first 10 meetings, so perhaps only the first 10 rows should be considered? Let me recount:\n\nRows 0 to 9 (since indexing starts at 0) would include up to Texas Tech? Wait no, Texas Tech is row 10 if there are 11 entries. But maybe \"first 10 meetings\" refers to each opponent's last 10 encounters with UT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is about across all opponents' last 10 meetings, how many times were they tied at 5-5 and how many times UT won 8-2.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Tied 5-5: Baylor (row 0), Iowa State (row 2), Nebraska (row 6), Oklahoma (row 7). That's four instances. So the first part of the claim is correct.\n  \n- UT winning 8-2: Colorado (row 1) has last 10 meetings as \"ut,8-2.\" Is there another instance? Looking again:\n\nKansas State's overall record is \"ut,8-2\" but that's under \"overall record,\" not \"last 10 meetings.\" The claim specifically mentions the first 10 meetings, so I think we should only consider the \"last 10 meetings\" column.\n\nSo in \"last 10 meetings,\" only Colorado (row 1) has UT winning 8-2. That's just one instance, but the claim says two times.\n\nTherefore, the second part of the claim isn't fully supported because there's only one occurrence where UT won 8-2 in the last 10 meetings across all opponents.\n\nSo the claim is not fully accurate because while there are four ties at 5-5, there are only two instances where UT won 8-2 (wait no, only one instance). Wait, let me check again:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Colorado: last 10 is \"ut,8-2\" \u2013 that's one.\n- Kansas State: under overall record it's \"ut,8-2,\" but in the \"last 10 meetings,\" it's \"ttu,6-4.\" So only Colorado has UT winning 8-2 in their last 10. Therefore, the claim says two times, which isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding and \"first 10 meeting\" refers to each opponent's first 10 meetings with UT. But given the table structure, it's more likely referring to all opponents' last 10 meetings collectively.\n\nThus, the claim is partially true but not fully because there are four ties at 5-5 (which matches) and only one instance where UT won 8-2 in their last 10 meetings. Therefore, since the claim states two times for the latter, it's incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions that in the first 10 meetings, there were four ties at 5-5 and two UT wins at 8-2. Checking each row:\n\n- **Tied 5-5**: Found in rows 0 (Baylor), 2 (Iowa State), 6 (Nebraska), and 7 (Oklahoma) \u2013 four instances.\n- **UT won 8-2**: Only found in row 1 (Colorado). However, the claim states two times, but only one instance is present.\n\nSince the second part isn't fully supported, the overall answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"last 10 meetings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"last 10 meetings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"last 10 meetings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"last 10 meetings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"last 10 meetings\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
