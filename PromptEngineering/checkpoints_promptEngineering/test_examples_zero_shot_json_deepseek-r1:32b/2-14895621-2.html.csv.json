    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng 3 time at tournament\"\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are outcome, event, year, venue, and partner. So, each row seems to represent a different instance of some event, maybe tournaments where Hwang Sun participated.\n\nLet me go through the data rows one by one.\n\nRow 0:\n- All cells in this row say \"world championships\". This might be the header or an initial setup, so probably not relevant for counting partnerships.\n\nRow 1:\n- Outcome: \"3\"\n- Event: \"wd\" (maybe women's doubles?)\n- Year: 1985\n- Venue: Calgary, Canada\n- Partner: Kang Haeng Suk\n\nSo here, Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng Suk once in the 1985 World Championships.\n\nRow 2:\n- All cells say \"asian games\". Again, likely a header or setup.\n\nRow 3:\n- Outcome: \"1\"\n- Event: \"wd\" (maybe women's doubles)\n- Year: 1982\n- Venue: New Delhi, India\n- Partner: Kang Haeng Suk\n\nAnother instance where Hwang Sun partnered with Kang in the Asian Games in 1982.\n\nRow 4:\n- All cells say \"other open tournaments\". Setup or header again.\n\nRow 5:\n- Outcome: \"1\"\n- Event: \"wd\" (women's doubles)\n- Year: 1985\n- Venue: India Open\n- Partner: Kang Haeng Suk\n\nSo this is another partnership in the India Open in 1985. \n\nNow, counting the partnerships between Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng Suk:\n\nRow 1: 1985 World Championships\nRow 3: 1982 Asian Games\nRow 5: 1985 India Open\n\nThat's three instances where they were partners. So the claim says \"3 times\", which matches what we see in the table.\n\nLooking at the relevant cells, each row (1, 3, 5) has the partner column as Kang Haeng Suk and Hwang Sun as the player. So for each of these rows, the partner column is relevant.\n\nSo I think the answer should be TRUE, with the relevant cells being rows 1, 3, and 5 under the \"partner\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. The columns are \"outcome,\" \"event,\" \"year,\" \"venue,\" and \"partner.\" There are six rows under the data section. It looks like each row represents a different event or outcome with corresponding details.\n\nThe claim is: \"Hwang Sun partner with Kang Haeng for the first time at the 1985 World Championship in Calgary, Canada.\"\n\nI need to break down this claim into its key components and check if they're supported by the table.\n\n1. **Event Name**: The event mentioned is the 1985 World Championship.\n2. **Venue**: It took place in Calgary, Canada.\n3. **Partnership**: Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng for the first time at this event.\n\nNow, let's look into the data to see if these details match.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- The first row under data is all \"world championships\" across columns. This might be a header or category.\n- The second row has values: 3, wd, 1985, Calgary, Canada, Kang Haeng-suk.\n\nWait, so in the second row, the \"year\" column says 1985, the venue is Calgary, Canada, and the partner is Kang Haeng-suk. But the claim mentions Hwang Sun as the partner with Kang Haeng. Hmm, does that match?\n\nLooking again at the data:\n- The second row's partner is Kang Haeng-suk, but it doesn't specify who they partnered with. It just lists the partner as Kang.\n\nBut in the third row, the event is Asian Games, year 1982, venue New Delhi, India, and partner Kang Haeng-suk again.\n\nAnd the fifth row mentions \"other open tournaments\" with the same partner in 1985 at India Open.\n\nSo, from the data provided, it seems that Kang Haeng-suk is the partner listed multiple times. However, the claim refers to Hwang Sun as the one partnering with Kang Haeng for the first time in 1985 at World Championships in Calgary.\n\nBut looking back at the table, there's no mention of \"Hwang Sun\" anywhere. The only partners mentioned are Kang Haeng-suk in different events and years. So, the claim introduces a new name not present in the data.\n\nMoreover, in the second row (which is about 1985 World Championships), the partner is listed as Kang Haeng-suk. But since Hwang Sun isn't listed as the other partner, I can't confirm if they partnered together.\n\nAlso, considering \"for the first time,\" we need to check previous events. The third and fourth rows are from 1982 Asian Games with the same partner. So, if this is their first partnership at 1985, that would contradict because they already partnered in 1982 according to the data.\n\nTherefore, two issues here:\n- Hwang Sun isn't listed as a partner anywhere.\n- If they were partners before (in 1982), it can't be the first time in 1985.\n\nSo, the claim doesn't hold based on the provided table. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table structure to understand what data we're dealing with. The table has columns: \"outcome\", \"event\", \"year\", \"venue\", and \"partner\". There are six rows of data under these columns.\n\nThe claim states that \"with her partner kang haeng, hwang sun finish in the top 3 at 3 different venues from 1982 to 1985.\" I need to break this down into parts:\n\n1. **Partner**: The claim mentions Kang Haeng. Looking through the \"partner\" column, all relevant entries have \"kang haeng  - suk\". So, that matches.\n\n2. **Years**: The time frame is from 1982 to 1985. Let's check the years in the table:\n   - Row 1 (second data row) has year 1985.\n   - Row 3 (fourth data row) has year 1982.\n   - Row 5 (sixth data row) also has year 1985.\n\nSo, we have years 1982 and two instances of 1985. Wait, that's only three years total but the claim mentions up to 1985, so I think it's within the timeframe.\n\n3. **Venues**: The claim says \"at 3 different venues.\" Let's look at the venues:\n   - Row 1: Calgary, Canada\n   - Row 3: New Delhi, India\n   - Row 5: India Open\n\nWait, but \"India Open\" is an event name, not a venue. So, perhaps that's incorrect.\n\nLooking back at the data:\n\n- The second row under venue is \"calgary , canada\".\n- The fourth row's venue is \"new delhi , india\".\n- The sixth row's venue is \"india open\".\n\nWait, so the venues are Calgary, New Delhi, and India Open. But \"India Open\" might be considered a different venue than just New Delhi? Or maybe it's another name for a location in India.\n\nBut regardless, there are three distinct venues: Calgary, New Delhi, and India Open. So that satisfies the 3 different venues part.\n\n4. **Top 3 finishes**: The claim says they finished in the top 3. Looking at the \"outcome\" column:\n   - Row 1 (third data row) has outcome \"3\".\n   - Row 3's outcome is \"1\".\n   - Row 5's outcome is \"1\".\n\nSo, outcomes are 3rd place, 1st place, and another 1st place. So they did finish in the top 3 at each venue.\n\nPutting it all together: Partner is correct, years are within the timeframe, three different venues, and finishes were in top 3 each time. Therefore, the claim seems to be supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the problem step by step. The task is to determine whether a given claim about a table in JSON format is TRUE or FALSE. I need to check each part of the claim against the data provided and see if all conditions hold true.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are \"outcome\", \"event\", \"year\", \"venue\", and \"partner\". There are six rows under these columns. Each row seems to represent different events or outcomes with corresponding details.\n\nThe claim is: \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng at the 1985 india open finish first 2 year after win the asian game\"\n\nBreaking down the claim into parts:\n\n1. **Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng**: I need to check if there's any row where the partner is Kang Haeng and the participant is Hwang Sun.\n2. **At the 1985 India Open**: I should look for an event named \"India Open\" in the year 1985.\n3. **Finish first**: This would mean that in that particular event, they came in first place or won it.\n4. **Two years after winning the Asian Games**: So, if they won the Asian Games in a certain year, the India Open win should be two years later.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- In row 1: The event is \"world championships\" in 1985 with partner Kang Haeng. The outcome is \"3\", which might indicate third place.\n- Row 3: Event is \"asian games\" in 1982, venue New Delhi, India, partner Kang Haeng. Outcome is \"1\", suggesting they won it.\n- Row 5: Event is \"other open tournaments\" in 1985 at \"india open\". Partner is again Kang Haeng. The outcome is \"1\".\n\nWait, the claim mentions Hwang Sun partnering with Kang Haeng, but looking through the partner column, all relevant entries (rows 1 and 5) have \"kang haeng - suk\" as the partner. There's no mention of Hwang Sun in any row except maybe implicitly? Or perhaps Hwang Sun is another participant not listed here?\n\nWait, actually, the table doesn't list individual participants like Hwang Sun but only shows the outcome, event, year, venue, and partner. So if the claim says \"Hwang Sun partner with Kang Haeng\", but in the data, the partner is always \"kang haeng - suk\". Maybe \"kang haeng\" refers to someone else? Or perhaps the table doesn't have information about Hwang Sun at all.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The \"partner\" column might refer to the other person, so if it's Kang Haeng, that could mean they are partners with someone else. But in the data, for row 5, partner is \"kang haeng - suk\", which seems like a single entity, perhaps their name.\n\nBut the claim says Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng. So I'm looking for a row where one of the participants (Hwang Sun) and her partner (Kang Haeng) are listed in the data. But the table doesn't have individual participant names except under \"partner\", which only has \"kang haeng - suk\" as an entry.\n\nSo, perhaps Hwang Sun is part of another column? Or maybe the table doesn't include that information. If the table lacks any mention of Hwang Sun, then how can we verify if she partnered with Kang Haeng?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is referring to events where someone from Hwang Sun's team or herself is involved. But without specific data about her, it's impossible to confirm.\n\nNext, looking at the event \"1985 India Open\". In row 5, venue is \"india open\" and year is 1985. The outcome is \"1\", which could mean they won it. So if that's the case, they finished first in 1985.\n\nNow, checking the Asian Games: in row 3, event is \"asian games\" with outcome \"1\" (win) in 1982. So two years after 1982 would be 1984, but the claim says they won the India Open in 1985, which is three years later. That's a discrepancy.\n\nSo, according to the data, the Asian Games were won in 1982, and the India Open was in 1985. The time between them is three years, not two as claimed. Therefore, that part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nAdditionally, since there's no mention of Hwang Sun in any row, we can't confirm she partnered with Kang Haeng at all. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"In 1982, Hwang Sun participate in the Asian Game in the double woman's double event, finish first, 1 of 2 time she win an event with Kang Haeng.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse each part of this claim and check against the table.\n\nThe table has columns: outcome, event, year, venue, partner. The data is presented in rows, where each row corresponds to a particular entry.\n\nLet's break down the claim:\n\n1. **Year 1982**: We're looking for entries where the year is 1982.\n2. **Event: Asian Game**: The event should be \"asian games.\"\n3. **Double woman's double event**: I'm not entirely sure what this refers to, but perhaps it's about a doubles event in women's category, so maybe \"wd\" (women's doubles) as per the table?\n4. **Finish first**: This would mean the outcome is 1st place.\n5. **Partner: Kang Haeng Suk**: The partner should be Kang Haeng Suk.\n\nLooking at the table data:\n\n- Rows are indexed starting from 0, I think each row represents a different entry or perhaps each column has multiple entries? Wait, looking again, the structure seems a bit off. The \"data\" array is an array of arrays. Each inner array corresponds to a row in the table.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the JSON structure:\n\nThe columns are [\"outcome\", \"event\", \"year\", \"venue\", \"partner\"], and then data has six rows. For example, the first row under data is all \"world championships\" across all five columns? That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps each inner array in \"data\" represents a row with values for each column.\n\nWait, looking at the JSON:\n\nThe first element of \"data\" is an array where each value corresponds to each column. So the first data row is: outcome=\"world championships\", event=\"world championships\", year=\"world championships\", venue=\"world championships\", partner=\"world championships\". That seems odd because all values are the same, but maybe it's a header or something. Then the next row has values like \"3\", \"wd\", \"1985\", etc.\n\nWait, perhaps each data row corresponds to an event entry. So let's list out each data row:\n\nRow 0: outcome=\"world championships\", event=\"world championships\", year=\"world championships\", venue=\"world championships\", partner=\"world championships\" \u2014 this seems like a header or maybe all the same for some reason.\n\nRow 1: outcome=3, event=wd, year=1985, venue=calgary, canada, partner=kang haeng suk.\n\nRow 2: outcome=asian games, event=asian games, year=asian games, venue=asian games, partner=asian games \u2014 again, all same value, maybe another header or a repeated entry?\n\nRow 3: outcome=1, event=wd, year=1982, venue=new delhi, india, partner=kang haeng suk.\n\nRow 4: outcome=other open tournaments, etc., same as row 0 and 2 \u2014 perhaps these are headers for different sections.\n\nRow 5: outcome=1, event=wd, year=1985, venue=india open, partner=kang haeng suk.\n\nSo the actual data rows that matter are rows 1,3,5 because they have numerical outcomes and specific years. Rows 0,2,4 seem to be headers or labels for different sections (like world championships, asian games, other tournaments).\n\nNow, focusing on row 3: outcome=1, event=wd, year=1982, venue=new delhi, india, partner=kang haeng suk.\n\nSo in this row, the outcome is 1, which suggests first place. The event is \"wd\" \u2014 perhaps women's doubles? The year is 1982, the venue is New Delhi, India, and the partner is Kang Haeng Suk.\n\nThe claim mentions Hwang Sun participating with Kang Haeng in the Asian Games in 1982, finishing first. In row 3, the outcome is 1, which aligns with finishing first. The year is 1982, event is \"wd\" (maybe women's doubles), venue is New Delhi, India, and partner is Kang Haeng Suk.\n\nSo this seems to support the claim that in 1982, Hwang Sun participated in the Asian Games, specifically in the women's doubles event, finishing first with Kang Haeng Suk as her partner.\n\nAdditionally, the claim says it's one of two times she won an event with Kang Haeng. Looking at other rows:\n\nRow 1: year=1985, outcome=3 \u2014 perhaps third place. Partner is also Kang Haeng Suk. So that's another time they participated together in 1985 but didn't win.\n\nRow 5: year=1985 again, venue=india open, outcome=1 \u2014 so first place, partner=kang haeng suk. So that would be another win with the same partner in 1985.\n\nWait, row 3 is 1982, outcome=1; row 5 is 1985, outcome=1. So Hwang Sun has two wins with Kang Haeng Suk: one in 1982 (asian games) and another in 1985 (india open). Therefore, the claim that it's \"1 of 2 times\" she won an event with Kang Haeng is correct because there are two instances where they won together.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE. The relevant cells include the year, outcome, event, venue, and partner from row 3, which confirm Hwang Sun's participation in the Asian Games in 1982, winning first place with Kang Haeng Suk as her partner.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine if the claim \"hwang sun partner with asian game 5 time at tournament\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, looking at the table structure. The columns are outcome, event, year, venue, and partner. Each row under data seems to represent different events or outcomes associated with a particular tournament.\n\nThe claim mentions \"hwang sun,\" but I don't see any entries in the partner column that match this name. Instead, all partner names listed are \"kang haeng  - suk.\" This suggests there might be confusion between Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng Suk as partners.\n\nNext, examining the events. The table lists several events, including Asian Games. I need to check how many times Asian Games appear with Kang Haeng Suk as the partner. Looking at the data rows:\n\n- Row 2: Event is \"world championships,\" so not relevant.\n- Row 3: Event is \"asian games\" with partner \"kang haeng  - suk.\"\n- Row 5: Another entry for \"asian games\" but no, wait\u2014row 4 is \"other open tournaments.\" Wait, actually, the data seems a bit confusing because each row under data might correspond to a different outcome or event. Let me recount:\n\nRow indexes start at 0, so:\n\n- Index 1 (first data row): Event is \"world championships,\" year 1985.\n- Index 3: Event \"asian games,\" year 1982, partner Kang Haeng Suk.\n- Index 5: Another entry for Asian Games? Wait, looking again, actually the second row under data has event \"wd\" which might be a different category. Maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, the table's data is structured such that each inner array represents a row with values across columns in order. So:\n\n- Row 0: All entries are \"world championships.\"\n- Row 1: [3, wd, 1985, calgary , canada, kang haeng  - suk]\n- Row 2: All entries are \"asian games.\"\n- Row 3: [1, wd, 1982, new delhi , india, kang haeng  - suk]\n- Row 4: All entries are \"other open tournaments.\"\n- Row 5: [1, wd, 1985, india open, kang haeng  - suk]\n\nSo, the event \"asian games\" appears in row 2. But looking at row 3, it's another event under 'wd' but with the Asian Games year? Or perhaps each row represents a different outcome.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for all instances where the event is \"asian games.\" In row 2, all columns are \"asian games,\" so that's one occurrence. Then in row 3, under event column (which would be index 1 of that row), it says 'wd', which might stand for something else. So perhaps only once does Asian Games occur as an event.\n\nBut wait, the partner is always Kang Haeng Suk, not Hwang Sun. The claim mentions \"hwang sun,\" but there's no such name in the partner column. Therefore, regardless of how many times Asian Games occurred with a partner, since the partner isn't Hwang Sun, the claim can't be supported.\n\nAdditionally, even if we ignore the partner's name for a moment, looking at how many times Asian Games are listed: row 2 is one instance, and any others? No, only once. So even if Hwang were involved, it wouldn't have been five times.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Hwang Sun isn't mentioned as a partner in any of the entries, and there's only one occurrence of Asian Games with Kang Haeng Suk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm given a table in JSON format and a claim that needs to be verified against this table. The goal is to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information provided in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the table. The table has five columns: outcome, event, year, venue, and partner. Looking at the data rows, it seems that each row represents a different competition or tournament with details about the outcome, event type, year, location, and the partner involved.\n\nNow, let's break down the claim to identify all the parts that need verification:\n\nClaim: \"Hwang Sun partner with Kang Haeng at the 1982 New Delhi, India finish first 2 years after win the world championship.\"\n\nBreaking this down:\n1. **Partner Information**: Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng.\n2. **Year and Venue**: The event took place in 1982 at New Delhi, India.\n3. **Outcome**: They finished first (implying a win).\n4. **Timing**: This happened two years after winning the world championship.\n\nI'll need to check each of these points against the table data.\n\nStarting with the partner information. The claim mentions Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng as partners. Looking at the \"partner\" column in the table, I see that in rows 1 and 3, the partner is listed as \"kang haeng  - suk\". Wait, the name is spelled \"haeng\" here, while the claim uses \"haeng.\" That's a bit confusing. But assuming it's the same person, just different spellings or formatting, I can tentatively accept this part.\n\nNext, the year and venue. The claim states 1982 in New Delhi, India. Looking at row 3, under the \"year\" column, it says \"1982,\" and the \"venue\" is \"new delhi , india.\" That matches perfectly with the claim's details about the event location and year.\n\nThe outcome mentioned is finishing first, which I believe corresponds to a win or top placement. In row 3, under the \"outcome\" column, it says \"1\", which might indicate the first position, so that aligns with the claim.\n\nNow, the timing aspect: the event in 1982 happened two years after winning the world championship. To verify this, I need to check if there's a world championship win in 1980 (two years before 1982) involving these partners. Looking at row 1, which is about the world championships, the year listed is \"1985\" under the \"year\" column. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 1985 is three years after 1982, not two years before. So if Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng won the world championship in 1985, then the event in 1982 would actually be three years before their world championship win, which contradicts the claim that it was two years after.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests a problem with the timing stated in the claim. The table shows that the world championships took place in 1985, and the Asian Games (which is what row 3 refers to) occurred in 1982. Therefore, the Asian Games event in 1982 was before their world championship win in 1985, not after.\n\nAnother point to consider: the claim mentions \"Hwang Sun partner with Kang Haeng.\" In the table, the partners are listed as \"kang haeng  - suk,\" which might imply that there's another person involved. However, since the claim only mentions Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng as partners, it doesn't account for the third person (suk). This could mean that the partnership in the table is a trio or that the names are formatted differently.\n\nPutting this all together:\n- The partner information partially matches but includes an additional name.\n- The year and venue match correctly.\n- The outcome matches as finishing first.\n- However, the timing does not align because the world championship win was in 1985, making the 1982 event three years before, not two years after.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim is FALSE because it incorrectly states that the 1982 event occurred two years after their world championship win. In reality, the world championship was won later in 1985.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully:\n\n\"In 1985, Hwang Sun participate in the Asian game in the double woman's double event, finish second, 2 of 3 time she win an event with Kang Haeng.\"\n\nI need to check each part of this statement against the table data.\n\nLooking at the JSON structure, the table has columns: \"outcome\", \"event\", \"year\", \"venue\", and \"partner\". The data is organized in rows where each row corresponds to a record. However, I notice that the first entry under data seems to be repeating \"world championships\" across all five columns for multiple rows, which might indicate that the table's structure isn't correctly aligned with the columns.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The \"columns\" array is [\"outcome\", \"event\", \"year\", \"venue\", \"partner\"], and each row under \"data\" should correspond to these columns. Let's look at the data rows:\n\n1. Row 0: All entries are \"world championships\". So outcome = world championships, event = world championships, etc.\n2. Row 1: [\"3\", \"wd\", \"1985\", \"calgary , canada\", \"kang haeng - suk\"]\n3. Row 2: All entries are \"asian games\".\n4. Row 3: [\"1\", \"wd\", \"1982\", \"new delhi , india\", \"kang haeng - suk\"]\n5. Row 4: All entries are \"other open tournaments\".\n6. Row 5: [\"1\", \"wd\", \"1985\", \"india open\", \"kang haeng - suk\"]\n\nWait, that's six rows under data, but the columns array has five elements. So each row should have five cells. Let me verify:\n\n- Row 0 has five entries, all \"world championships\".\n- Row 1 has five: \"3\", \"wd\", \"1985\", \"calgary , canada\", \"kang haeng - suk\"\n- Similarly for rows 2 to 5.\n\nSo each row corresponds correctly to the columns.\n\nNow, let's break down the claim:\n\n- In 1985: So we need data where year is 1985.\n- Hwang Sun participates in Asian games. Wait, but looking at the table, I don't see any entries with \"Hwang Sun\" as a partner or participant. The partners listed are all \"kang haeng - suk\". Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe Hwang Sun is implied by her participation alongside Kang Haeng. But the claim mentions she participates in the Asian games in 1985. Let's check if there's an entry for Asian games in 1985.\n\nLooking at rows:\n\n- Row 2: Event is \"asian games\" with year as \"asian games\". Wait, that doesn't make sense because the event should be a category and the year should be numerical. That might indicate an issue with how the data is structured. Alternatively, perhaps row 3 has event as \"wd\", which could mean women's doubles?\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me try to map each column correctly.\n\nEach row in the data corresponds to:\n\n0: outcome\n1: event\n2: year\n3: venue\n4: partner\n\nSo for row 1:\n- outcome: 3\n- event: wd (women's doubles)\n- year: 1985\n- venue: calgary, canada\n- partner: kang haeng - suk\n\nSimilarly, row 3:\n- outcome: 1\n- event: wd\n- year: 1982\n- venue: new delhi, india\n- partner: kang haeng - suk\n\nRow 5:\n- outcome: 1\n- event: wd\n- year: 1985\n- venue: india open\n- partner: kang haeng - suk\n\nNow, the claim mentions participation in the Asian games in 1985. Looking at row 2, which lists all cells as \"asian games\", but that seems odd because other rows have actual data.\n\nWait, perhaps row 2 is a header for Asian games? Or maybe it's an error in data entry. Because if we take row 2 as event = asian games, then year would be \"asian games\", which doesn't make sense. Similarly, venue would be \"asian games\" again, and partner as well.\n\nThis suggests that the table might have been structured incorrectly, with some rows being headers or repeated information rather than actual data entries.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps I should focus on rows where the year is 1985 and event is related to Asian games.\n\nLooking for year = 1985 in the \"year\" column (column index 2):\n\n- Row 1: year 1985\n- Row 5: year 1985\n\nNow, checking if these events are related to Asian games:\n\nRow 1's event is \"wd\" (women's doubles), and venue is Calgary, Canada. So that seems like the World Championships.\n\nRow 5's event is \"other open tournaments\"? Wait, no, row 4 has all cells as \"other open tournaments\". Row 5's data: outcome=1, event=wd, year=1985, venue=india open, partner=kang haeng - suk. So this seems like an open tournament in India.\n\nWait, but the claim is about Asian games in 1985. The only row that mentions \"asian games\" is row 2, which might be a header or incorrect entry because all its columns are \"asian games\", which doesn't fit the structure of outcome, event, year, venue, partner.\n\nSo perhaps there's no data about Hwang Sun participating in Asian games in 1985. The partners listed are only Kang Haeng - Suk, but Hwang Sun isn't mentioned as a participant in any row. \n\nAdditionally, the claim says she finished second (2 of 3 times), implying multiple participations with Kang Haeng. However, in the data, we have:\n\n- Row 1: outcome=3, which might mean third place? Or perhaps it's the number of wins?\n- Row 5: outcome=1, first place.\n\nBut without clear labels for what each outcome signifies (e.g., win or position), it's hard to interpret. \n\nGiven that Hwang Sun isn't listed as a partner anywhere in the table and there might be confusion about the data structure, especially regarding Asian games entries, I think the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 1985, Hwang Sun participated in the Asian Games women's doubles event, finished second, and won two out of three times with Kang Haeng. However, examining the table:\n\n- There is no mention of \"Hwang Sun\" as a participant or partner.\n- The row for \"asian games\" (row 2) seems to be incorrectly formatted since all columns are labeled \"asian games,\" which doesn't fit the expected data structure.\n- In rows where the year is 1985, the events are either women's doubles in Calgary, Canada (World Championships), or an open tournament in India. These don't correspond to the Asian Games.\n\nTherefore, there is insufficient evidence in the table to support the claim that Hwang Sun participated in the Asian Games in 1985 with Kang Haeng and achieved the stated outcomes.\n\n**Answer:** The data does not support the claim.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table in JSON format and a claim to verify. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the table structure: there are five columns - outcome, event, year, venue, partner. The data rows seem to be split into multiple arrays under \"data\". Each row represents some kind of record or entry with these attributes.\n\nThe claim is: \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng for the first time at the 1982 world championship in the india open.\"\n\nWait, actually, I notice that in the table, the partner name is \"kang haeng  - suk\" (with two spaces and a hyphen). The claim mentions \"kang haeng\", which is slightly different. Maybe it's just a formatting issue or typo, but I should keep that in mind.\n\nNow, let me parse the claim to extract key points:\n1. Partner: Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng.\n2. First time partnership.\n3. Event: 1982 World Championship at India Open venue.\n\nWait, actually, the event is \"world championships\" in one part of the table. Let's see if any row matches all these conditions.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n- The first row under data seems to be headers? Wait no, because it has values like \"world championships\", so maybe each array in data represents a row, and each element corresponds to columns in order: outcome, event, year, venue, partner.\n\nSo let's index them properly:\n\nRow 0 (data[0]): All entries are \"world championships\" across all columns. That seems odd because it might be the header or perhaps an error.\nWait no, looking back, the table structure is given with \"columns\" as [outcome, event, year, venue, partner], and data as a list of rows. So each row in data has 5 elements corresponding to these columns.\n\nSo let's go through each row:\n\nRow 0 (data[0]):\n- outcome: world championships\n- event: world championships\n- year: world championships\n- venue: world championships\n- partner: world championships\n\nThat doesn't make sense. Maybe it's the header, but then why? Or perhaps a mistake in data entry.\n\nRow 1:\n- outcome: \"3\"\n- event: \"wd\" (maybe short for women's doubles?)\n- year: 1985\n- venue: calgary , canada\n- partner: kang haeng - suk\n\nSo this row has event as \"wd\", year 1985, venue Calgary.\n\nRow 2:\n- outcome: asian games\n- event: asian games\n- year: asian games\n- venue: asian games\n- partner: asian games\n\nAgain, similar to the first row, all columns have the same value. Maybe another header or incorrect data.\n\nRow3:\n- outcome: \"1\"\n- event: \"wd\" (women's doubles)\n- year: 1982\n- venue: new delhi , india\n- partner: kang haeng - suk\n\nSo this row has event as \"wd\", year 1982, venue New Delhi.\n\nRow4:\n- outcome: other open tournaments\n- event: other open tournaments\n- year: other open tournaments\n- venue: other open tournaments\n- partner: other open tournaments\n\nAgain, all columns have the same value. Seems like another header or error.\n\nRow5:\n- outcome: \"1\"\n- event: \"wd\" (women's doubles)\n- year: 1985\n- venue: india open\n- partner: kang haeng - suk\n\nSo this row has event as \"wd\", year 1985, venue India Open.\n\nNow, the claim is about Hwang Sun partnering with Kang Haeng for the first time at the 1982 World Championship in the India Open.\n\nWait, looking at the data, I don't see any mention of \"Hwang Sun\". The partner column only has \"kang haeng - suk\" and other entries like \"asian games\", etc. So if Hwang Sun is a player, but she's not mentioned as a partner in any row except where it's Kang Haeng - Suk.\n\nWait the claim says \"partner with kang haeng for the first time\". But looking at the data, the partner column is either \"kang haeng - suk\" or other non-person entries. So perhaps Hwang Sun is another player not listed as a partner? Or maybe the data is incomplete.\n\nIn row3, the venue is New Delhi, India, event year 1982, and partner is Kang Haeng - Suk. But the outcome is \"1\". Hmm.\n\nBut the claim mentions \"world championship\" in the India Open venue. Looking at the rows:\n\n- Row0: all world championships\n- Row3: event is \"wd\", which might be women's doubles but not specifically a World Championship.\n- Row5: venue is \"india open\", year 1985.\n\nSo for the claim, it says \"at the 1982 world championship in the India Open.\" But looking at row3, the event is \"wd\" (maybe Asian Games?), year 1982, venue New Delhi. And row5 has venue India Open but year 1985.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me see:\n\nThe claim says it's a World Championship in 1982 at the India Open venue. But looking at the data, there is no row that combines \"world championships\" event with \"india open\" as venue and year 1982.\n\nIn row3: event is \"wd\", which might be something else, but venue is New Delhi, not India Open. And it's in 1982.\n\nRow5 has venue India Open but year 1985, not 1982.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is incorrect because there's no row that matches all three: World Championship event, 1982, and India Open as venue.\n\nAdditionally, the partner column doesn't mention Hwang Sun. So if Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng for the first time, but the data only shows \"kang haeng - suk\" as a partner, perhaps that's indicating both are partners? Or maybe it's a typo in the claim or table.\n\nWait, the claim says Hwang Sun and kang haeng. The data has \"kang haeng - suk\". Maybe Suk is another name for Haeng? Not sure. But the main issue is whether there's a row that mentions 1982 World Championship at India Open with partners Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Row3: event is \"wd\", year 1982, venue New Delhi.\n- There's no mention of Hwang Sun in any partner column. So if the claim says Hwang Sun partnered with kang haeng for the first time at that event, but there's no record of her partnering in that row.\n\nTherefore, based on the data provided, the claim doesn't hold because:\n\n1. There is no entry where the event is World Championship in 1982 at India Open.\n2. Hwang Sun is not listed as a partner anywhere in the table.\n\nSo I would say the claim is incorrect based on the given data.\n\nBut wait, maybe \"wd\" stands for women's doubles and that could be part of the Asian Games or World Championships? If event \"wd\" was a World Championship, then row3 has year 1982, venue New Delhi. But the claim mentions India Open as venue.\n\nWait, but in the data, only row5 mentions India Open, which is in 1985. So no, that doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, there's no row where it's World Championship (event), year 1982, venue India Open with Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng as partners.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng for the first time at the 1982 World Championship in the India Open is incorrect based on the provided data. Here's why:\n\n1. **Event Details**: The data does not contain a row where the event is explicitly labeled as a \"World Championship\" occurring in 1982 at the India Open venue.\n\n2. **Venue and Year Mismatch**:\n   - Row3 lists an event in 1982 with the venue New Delhi, India, but the event is marked as \"wd,\" which could be women's doubles, not specifically a World Championship.\n   - The India Open venue appears only in row5 for the year 1985.\n\n3. **Partner Information**: Hwang Sun is not listed as a partner in any of the rows. The partner column only mentions \"kang haeng - suk\" and other non-person entries, indicating that there's no record of Hwang Sun partnering with Kang Haeng at any event in the provided data.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, the claim cannot be supported.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm given a table in JSON format and a claim that I need to verify as TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are \"outcome\", \"event\", \"year\", \"venue\", and \"partner\". There are six rows of data. Each row seems to represent an event with specific details like outcome, year, venue, etc.\n\nThe claim is: \"with her partner kang haeng , hwang sun finish first at 3 different venue from 1982 to 1985\"\n\nBreaking down the claim:\n\n1. **Partner**: The claim mentions \"kang haeng\" as the partner. In the table, looking at the 'partner' column, I see entries like \"kang haeng  - suk\". So, it's slightly different but seems to refer to the same person.\n\n2. **Player**: The claim refers to hwang sun as the player. However, in the provided data, there is no mention of a player named hwang sun. All rows under 'partner' have \"kang haeng - suk\" or similar, and I don't see any other names listed. So this might be an issue because if the table doesn't list hwang sun as the main player, it's hard to confirm her participation.\n\n3. **Finishing First**: The claim states that they finished first at 3 different venues from 1982 to 1985. Looking at the 'outcome' column, I see values like \"3\", \"1\", and others. Assuming \"1\" means finishing first (win), let's check which entries have outcome \"1\".\n\n   - Row indices with outcome \"1\":\n     - Row 2: Outcome is \"3\"\n     - Row 4: Outcome is \"1\" (Year 1982)\n     - Row 5: Outcome is \"1\" (Year 1985)\n     - Wait, row 2 has outcome \"3\", which might mean third place. Rows 4 and 5 have outcome \"1\". So only two instances where they finished first.\n\n   But the claim says three different venues from 1982 to 1985. However, according to the data, there are only two outcomes with \"1\" (first place) in that period.\n\n4. **Venues**: The venues listed are:\n   - Calgary, Canada (Row 3)\n   - New Delhi, India (Row 5)\n   - India Open (Row 6)\n\nWait, looking back at the data:\n\n- Row indices start from 0 to 5.\n- Row 1: outcome is \"3\", year 1985\n- Row 3: outcome is \"1\", year 1982\n- Row 5: outcome is \"1\", year 1985\n\nSo, two wins in 1982 and 1985. The venues are New Delhi (Row 4) and India Open (Row 6). Wait, but row indices may be different.\n\nWait the data structure is a bit confusing because each row under 'data' seems to represent a group of rows rather than individual entries. Let me re-examine:\n\nLooking at the JSON structure again, the \"data\" array has six elements. Each element is an array where each sub-array represents a row in the table.\n\nSo, data[0] is [\"world championships\", ...], which might be headers? Or perhaps not. Wait, no, because it's a list of lists. The first entry under 'data' is all \"world championships\" across columns except the last one. Then data[1] has specific values like 3, wd, 1985, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps each row in data corresponds to an event, and each column represents different attributes for that event.\n\nSo:\n\n- Row 0: All entries are \"world championships\" across columns? That doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a mistake or misinterpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the first row under 'data' is the headers repeated, which might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each sub-array in data represents a single record where each element corresponds to the column in order. So, for example:\n\ncolumns: [\"outcome\", \"event\", \"year\", \"venue\", \"partner\"]\n\nThen data[0] would be:\noutcome: \"world championships\"\nevent: \"world championships\"\nyear: \"world championships\"\nvenue: \"world championships\"\npartner: \"world championships\"\n\nThat doesn't make sense because the values for 'year' and others should be numerical or specific names, not repeating \"world championships\".\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. Perhaps data is structured differently. Maybe each row in data represents a single entry with each column filled accordingly.\n\nBut looking at data[1], which is [\"3\", \"wd\", \"1985\", \"calgary , canada\", \"kang haeng  - suk\"], this seems more plausible as individual entries.\n\nSo perhaps the first sub-array (data[0]) is a header row, and then each subsequent sub-array represents an event. So:\n\n- data[0]: headers: [\"outcome\", \"event\", \"year\", \"venue\", \"partner\"]\n- data[1]: event 1\n- data[2]: event 2\n- etc.\n\nBut in that case, the claim refers to hwang sun and kang haeng. Let's see if any of the partners are kang haeng.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: partner is \"world championships\" (probably not)\nRow 1: partner is \"kang haeng - suk\"\nRow 2: partner is \"asian games\" (no, that's the event name)\nWait no, data[1] is [\"3\", \"wd\", \"1985\", \"calgary , canada\", \"kang haeng - suk\"], so in row 1, the partner is kang.\n\nThen, rows:\n\n- Row 0: all same as column names? Maybe not. Perhaps each sub-array represents a different event category, and then under that, multiple events.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to process each data entry as an individual event record.\n\nAssuming that, let's list out the relevant details:\n\nLooking for events where partner is kang haeng - suk (close enough to the claim), outcome is 1 (first place), and year between 1982-1985.\n\nCheck each row in data:\n\nRow 0: All entries are \"world championships\", probably not useful.\n\nRow 1:\nOutcome: 3\nEvent: wd\nYear: 1985\nVenue: Calgary, Canada\nPartner: kang haeng - suk\n\nSo outcome is 3, which might be third place. Not a win.\n\nRow 2: All entries are \"asian games\", again probably headers or event category.\n\nRow 3:\nOutcome: 1\nEvent: wd\nYear: 1982\nVenue: New Delhi, India\nPartner: kang haeng - suk\n\nThis is a win (outcome 1), year 1982, venue New Delhi.\n\nRow 4: All entries are \"asian games\" again, maybe another header or category.\n\nRow 5:\nOutcome: 1\nEvent: wd\nYear: 1985\nVenue: India Open\nPartner: kang haeng - suk\n\nAnother win in 1985 at India Open.\n\nSo total of two wins (outcomes 1) in 1982 and 1985, venues New Delhi and India Open. So two different venues where they won.\n\nThe claim is three different venues from 1982-1985. But according to the data, only two events where outcome was first place, each at a different venue.\n\nAdditionally, the partner's name in the data is \"kang haeng - suk\", which might be similar but not exactly kang haeng as in the claim.\n\nMoreover, there's no mention of hwang sun in any row. The partner is always kang haeng - suk or the event category names like asian games.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided data, it appears that hwang sun (if she is a participant) isn't listed here, and the number of wins at different venues is two, not three.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided data, the team with partner \"kang haeng - suk\" achieved first place in two events: one in 1982 at New Delhi, India, and another in 1985 at the India Open. There are only two distinct venues where they secured a win during the specified period.
