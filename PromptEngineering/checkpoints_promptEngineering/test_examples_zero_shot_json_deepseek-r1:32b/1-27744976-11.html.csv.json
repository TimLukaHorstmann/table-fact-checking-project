    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim states: \"Kevin Martin scored the highest amount of points singularly for all of the game except the game on April 9.\"\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row in the data to check who had the highest points and see if Kevin Martin is mentioned as the top scorer in each game except April 9.\n\nLooking at row 0 (April 1), the \"high points\" column shows \"kevin martin (33)\". So, he scored the most there.\n\nRow 1 (April 3) also has \"kevin martin (35)\" as the high scorer. Again, Kevin leads here.\n\nRow 2 is April 5 with \"kevin martin (30)\", so he's still at the top.\n\nIn row 3 (April 6), it's \"kevin martin (21)\". He still has the highest points in this game.\n\nNow, row 4 is April 9. The high points are listed as \"chase budinger , kevin martin , brad miller (16)\". Wait, that means all three scored 16 points each. So Kevin isn't singularly the top scorer here; it's a tie. Therefore, the claim says he didn't score the highest in this game, which aligns with the data.\n\nMoving to row 5 (April 11), \"kevin martin (28)\" is listed again as the high points.\n\nSo, in every game except April 9, Kevin Martin was the sole top scorer. On April 9, he tied with others. Thus, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Kevin Martin scored the highest points in all games except April 9, where there was a tie. The relevant cells are the \"high points\" column across each row.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"the game with the highest attendance be at the toyota center on april 9.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. The main points are:\n\n1. Identify the game(s) played at Toyota Center.\n2. Check which of those games had the highest attendance.\n3. Verify if that highest attendance occurred on April 9.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by examining the \"location attendance\" column to find all games held at Toyota Center and their corresponding attendances.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Row 0: Toyota Center with 18059 attendees on April 1.\n- Row 1: Toyota Center with 15993 on April 3.\n- Row 2: Toyota Center with 15523 on April 5.\n- Row 4: Toyota Center with 18089 on April 9.\n- Row 5: Toyota Center with 14898 on April 11.\n\nSo, the games at Toyota Center are rows 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5. Now, I'll list their attendances:\n\n- Row 0: 18059\n- Row 1: 15993\n- Row 2: 15523\n- Row 4: 18089\n- Row 5: 14898\n\nLooking for the highest attendance among these, I see that row 0 has 18059 and row 4 has 18089. Comparing these two, row 4 (April 9) has a slightly higher attendance of 18089 compared to row 0's 18059.\n\nNow, the claim states that the highest attendance was on April 9 at Toyota Center. Based on this, since row 4 is indeed the highest among all Toyota Center games, the claim holds true.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the \"location attendance\" for each Toyota Center game to compare attendances.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because April 9's game at Toyota Center had the highest attendance of 18089 among all Toyota Center games listed.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"goran dragi\u0107 do not have the most high assist in any game before april 9\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It states that Goran Dragi\u0107 did not have the highest assists in any game before April 9th. So I need to look at all games before April 9 and check if Dragi\u0107 was the one with the most assists in any of them.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns relevant here are \"date\" and \"high assists\". Each row represents a game, so I'll go through each game's date and see which ones fall before April 9. Then, for those games, check who had the highest assists.\n\nLet me list out the rows with their dates:\n\n- Row 0: April 1\n- Row 1: April 3\n- Row 2: April 5\n- Row 3: April 6\n- Row 4: April 9 (This is the cutoff date; games before April 9 would be up to row 3)\n- Rows beyond row 4 are after April 9, so I can ignore them for this claim.\n\nNow, focusing on rows 0 to 3:\n\nRow 0:\n- Date: April 1\n- High Assists: \"luis scola (6)\"\nSo, Dragi\u0107 is not listed here. So he didn't have the most assists in this game.\n\nRow 1:\n- Date: April 3\n- High Assists: \"kyle lowry (8)\"\nAgain, Dragi\u0107 isn't mentioned; Lowry had the highest with 8.\n\nRow 2:\n- Date: April 5\n- High Assists: \"kyle lowry (9)\"\nSame as above. Still no Dragi\u0107.\n\nRow 3:\n- Date: April 6\n- High Assists: \"courtney lee , kyle lowry (6)\"\nHere, both Courtney Lee and Kyle Lowry are listed with 6 assists each. No mention of Dragi\u0107.\n\nSo, in all games before April 9, the high assist leaders were Luis Scola, Kyle Lowry, and Courtney Lee, but not Goran Dragi\u0107. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because he doesn't have the highest assists in any game prior to April 9.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Goran Dragic did not lead in assists in any games before April 9. Checking each relevant row (0-3), we see that high assists were held by others, so the claim holds.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out if the claim \"luis scola score the highest number of high rebound in game 76 on april 1\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the table structure. The columns are: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, record. Each row represents a different game with its details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"game 76\" and \"april 1\". Looking at the data rows, row index 0 corresponds to game 76 on April 1. So I'll focus on that row for verification.\n\nLooking at column names related to rebounds: the 'high rebounds' column is where individual players and their rebound counts are listed. For game 76 (row 0), under 'high rebounds', it's \"luis scola (14)\". \n\nThe claim states that Luis Scola scored the highest number of high rebounds in that game. Since he's listed there with 14 rebounds, and no other player is mentioned alongside him, it implies he had the highest rebound count for that game.\n\nI should also check if any other row has a higher rebound by Scola or another player on April 1, but since the claim is about game 76 specifically, which is only in row 0, there's no need to look further. \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Luis Scola did have the highest rebounds (14) in game 76.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says there were 3191 more people at the game versus LA Clippers than at the game versus Dallas. \n\nFirst, I need to find the relevant games in the table. Looking through the data, I see two entries: one against LA Clippers (game number 80) and another against Dallas (game number 81). \n\nFor each of these games, I should check the \"location attendance\" column because that tells me how many people attended each game.\n\nLooking at game 80 against LA Clippers, the attendance is listed as \"toyota center 18089\". So, 18,089 people were there. \n\nThen, for game 81 against Dallas, the attendance is \"toyota center 14898\", which means 14,898 attendees.\n\nNow, to find out how many more people attended the LA Clippers game compared to Dallas, I subtract the smaller number from the larger one: 18,089 minus 14,898. Let's do that calculation:\n\n18,089 - 14,898 = 3,191\n\nWait a minute, that matches exactly what the claim states\u20143,191 more people attended the LA Clippers game than the Dallas game. \n\nSo, checking these numbers from the table supports the claim.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"brad miller score the highest amount of point singularly for all of the game except the game on april 11\".\n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. It seems that Brad Miller scored the most points in each game listed, except for the one on April 11. So, I need to check each row to see who had the highest points and compare it to whether Brad Miller is mentioned there.\n\nLooking at the table's \"high points\" column:\n\n- Game 76 (April 1): Kevin Martin with 33 points.\n- Game 77 (April 3): Kevin Martin with 35 points.\n- Game 78 (April 5): Kevin Martin with 30 points.\n- Game 79 (April 6): Kevin Martin with 21 points.\n- Game 80 (April 9): Multiple players: Chase Budinger, Kevin Martin, Brad Miller all with 16 points. So here, it's a tie, but the claim says Brad scored the highest singularly, which might mean he was the only one? But in this case, there are others tied.\n- Game 81 (April 11): Kevin Martin with 28 points.\n\nSo, for all games except April 9 and April 11, Kevin Martin had the highest. On April 9, Brad Miller is among those who scored 16 points, but since it's a tie, he didn't score the \"highest singularly.\" On April 11, Kevin Martin again has the high.\n\nWait, the claim says except April 11, so that would mean Brad should have had the highest in all other games. But looking at each game:\n\n- April 1: Kevin\n- April 3: Kevin\n- April 5: Kevin\n- April 6: Kevin\n- April 9: Tie between three players, including Brad.\n- April 11: Kevin\n\nSo Brad only tied on April 9 and didn't have the highest singularly anywhere else. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because Brad Miller did not score the highest points in any game except perhaps April 9 where it was a tie, but the claim says \"except April 11,\" implying he should have had the high in all others, which isn't true.\n\nThe relevant cells are the \"high points\" for each row.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns in the table. The relevant column for assists is \"high assists\". This column lists who had the most assists in each game and how many they had.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific dates: April 3 and April 5. Looking at the data rows:\n\n1. **April 3 (Row Index 1)**:\n   - High Assists: Kyle Lowry with 8 assists.\n   \n2. **April 5 (Row Index 2)**:\n   - High Assists: Kyle Lowry again, this time with 9 assists.\n\nNow, the claim is that Kyle Lowry had the lowest assist in these games. But wait, \"high assists\" means he led his team in assists for those games. So if it's about who had the highest, then saying he has the lowest would be incorrect. \n\nIn both April 3 and April 5 games, Kyle Lowry is listed as having the most assists among his teammates.

The claim is: \"the game with the highest attendance be at the new orleans arena on april 6.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what we're looking for. We need to find out which game had the highest attendance and check if that was indeed played at New Orleans Arena on April 6.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the relevant columns here are \"location attendance\" and \"date\". The \"location attendance\" tells us where the game was held and how many people attended. So, for each row, I'll need to extract the location and the attendance number.\n\nLet's go through each game one by one:\n\n1. Game 76: April 1 at Toyota Center with 18059 attendees.\n2. Game 77: April 3 at Toyota Center with 15993 attendees.\n3. Game 78: April 5 at Toyota Center with 15523 attendees.\n4. Game 79: April 6 at New Orleans Arena with 12728 attendees.\n5. Game 80: April 9 at Toyota Center with 18089 attendees.\n6. Game 81: April 11 at Toyota Center with 14898 attendees.\n\nNow, let's compare the attendance numbers:\n\n- The highest number I see is 18059 for game 76 on April 1 and then again 18089 for game 80 on April 9. Comparing these two, 18089 is higher than 18059. So the highest attendance was actually in game 80.\n\nThe claim says that the highest attendance was at New Orleans Arena on April 6. However, from the data, game 79 on April 6 had only 12728 attendees, which isn't the highest. The highest attendance was at Toyota Center for both games 76 and 80.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the highest attendance wasn't at New Orleans Arena but at Toyota Center.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the game with the highest attendance (18089) occurred at Toyota Center on April 9, not at New Orleans Arena on April 6. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Each row represents a different game with its details.\n\nI'll start by checking if there's a game numbered 54 on April 3. However, looking through the data provided:\n\n- The games listed are numbered from 76 to 81.\n- None of these games have the number 54, so that immediately raises a red flag.\n\nNext, I'll check each row for April 3 as the date.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n- Row index 0: April 1\n- Row index 1: April 3 (this matches the claim's date)\n- Row index 2: April 5\n- Row index 3: April 6\n- Row index 4: April 9\n- Row index 5: April 11\n\nSo, only row index 1 has the date \"april 3\".

In this particular game (row index 1, April 3), Scola isn't listed in the high rebounds; instead, it's Chuck Haynes who leads with 12 rebounds.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"there be 3191 more people in attendance at the game versus dallas than at the game versus the la clippers.\"\n\nFirst, I'll identify which rows correspond to these two games. Looking through the data:\n\n- The game against Dallas is row 81 (April 11). Its location attendance is listed as \"toyota center 14898\".\n- The game against LA Clippers is row 80 (April 9). Its location attendance is \"toyota center 18089\".\n\nNext, I'll extract the attendance numbers:\n\n- Dallas: 14,898\n- LA Clippers: 18,089\n\nNow, I need to calculate the difference between these two attendances. The claim says there were more people at the Dallas game compared to LA Clippers by 3,191.\n\nCalculating the difference:\nDallas Attendance - LA Clippers Attendance = 14,898 - 18,089 = -3,191\n\nThis result is negative, meaning there were actually fewer people at the Dallas game. The claim suggests more attendance at Dallas, which isn't accurate based on these numbers.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the attendance was lower against Dallas by 3,191 compared to LA Clippers.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 80, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 81, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
