    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"st kilda have the highest score as an away team in the 1928 vfl season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. The columns are: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a game with these details.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions St Kilda as an away team and whether they have the highest score in that role during the 1928 VFL season. So I need to look at all the rows where St Kilda is listed as the away team and check their scores against other away teams' scores across the same date, which is 28 July 1928.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: Home team is North Melbourne, Away team is St Kilda. Their score is \"21.11 (137)\".\nRow 1: Home is Footscray, Away is Geelong. Score: \"8.8 (56)\".\nRow 2: Home Collingwood, Away Richmond. Score: \"10.13 (73)\".\nRow 3: Home Carlton, Away Hawthorn. Score: \"11.13 (79)\".\nRow 4: Home Melbourne, Away Fitzroy. Score: \"11.13 (79)\".\nRow 5: Home South Melbourne, Away Essendon. Score: \"18.11 (119)\".\n\nNow, focusing on away team scores:\n\nSt Kilda's score is the highest at 21.11 (137). I need to compare this with other away teams' scores from the same date. \n\nWait, but all rows have the same date: \"28 july 1928\". So it's only one day, not the entire season. However, the claim refers to the 1928 VFL season, so perhaps there are multiple games on that date? But in this table, these are the games for that specific date.\n\nSo, within this single date's data, St Kilda has the highest away score at 137 points. The next closest is Essendon with 119, then Fitzroy and Hawthorn both at 79, followed by Collingwood (Richmond as away) at 73, Geelong at 56, and Footscray at 57.\n\nTherefore, in this table's data for that date, St Kilda indeed has the highest score as an away team. But wait, is there any other game on that date where another away team might have a higher score? From what I see, no. So based solely on this data, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that St Kilda had the highest away team score in the 1928 VFL season. Examining the table, all games are from \"28 july 1928\". Among these, St Kilda's away score is the highest at 21.11 (137). Other away teams' scores are lower.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"victoria park venue have the largest crowd in the 1928 vfl season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. The columns include \"venue\" and \"crowd\". Each row represents a game with details like home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd size, and date.\n\nThe claim is about the crowd size at Victoria Park being the largest in the 1928 VFL season. So I need to check all the entries for each venue's crowd number to find out which one has the highest value.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: Arden Street Oval, crowd of 11,000\nRow 1: Western Oval, crowd of 14,000\nRow 2: Victoria Park, crowd of 30,000\nRow 3: Princes Park, crowd of 10,000\nRow 4: MCG, crowd of 13,562\nRow 5: Lake Oval, crowd of 16,000\n\nSo the crowd numbers are:\n\n- Arden Street Oval: 11,000\n- Western Oval: 14,000\n- Victoria Park: 30,000\n- Princes Park: 10,000\n- MCG: 13,562\n- Lake Oval: 16,000\n\nThe highest number is 30,000 at Victoria Park. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells:\n\nI need to identify which cells were used to determine this. The \"crowd\" column in each row and specifically the crowd size for Victoria Park.\n\nSo, for each game, I looked at the crowd numbers, but since only Victoria Park had 30,000, that's the one supporting the claim.\n\nThus, relevant_cells would include the crowd numbers from all rows to compare, but since the answer is based on Victoria Park being the highest, maybe just its row? Or perhaps all the crowds to confirm it's the largest. I think including all the \"crowd\" columns makes sense because each was considered in determining the maximum.\n\nBut according to instructions, relevant_ cells are those that support the claim directly. Since the claim is about Victoria Park having the largest crowd, only the row where venue is Victoria Park and its crowd number are needed to confirm it's 30,000, which is higher than others. Alternatively, perhaps including all crowd numbers to show comparison.\n\nWait, but in the example given earlier, when checking for max revenue, they included multiple rows. So maybe I should list each row's \"crowd\" column as relevant because I compared them all to find the maximum.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 0: crowd\nRow 1: crowd\nRow 2: crowd (Victoria Park)\nRow 3: crowd\nRow 4: crowd\nRow 5: crowd\n\nIncluding each of these rows under the \"crowd\" column because each was checked to determine which is the largest. However, since the answer focuses on Victoria Park's 30,000 being the highest, maybe only that row is needed. But the instructions say to include cells relevant to verify the claim, so perhaps all crowd numbers are necessary for context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just the row where the venue is Victoria Park and its crowd number is sufficient because once we see it's 30,000 and others are lower, we can confirm it's the largest without listing all. But given that in some cases, if two venues have the same max, you might need to check all, but here it's clear.\n\nWait, perhaps the best approach is to include only the relevant row where Victoria Park's crowd is listed because that directly supports the claim. The other rows are just context for comparison but not necessary as part of the answer since they don't contradict or support the claim on their own.\n\nSo, I'll go with including only the row index 2 and column \"crowd\" as relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"collingwood have a lower score as a home team than melbourne\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided in JSON format. The columns are: \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", \"away team score\", \"venue\", \"crowd\", and \"date\". There are six rows of data corresponding to different matches on July 28, 1928.\n\nThe claim compares Collingwood's home team score against Melbourne's home team score. So I need to find the rows where Collingwood is the home team and Melbourne is the home team, then compare their respective scores.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Row 0: North Melbourne vs St Kilda\n- Row 1: Footscray vs Geelong\n- Row 2: Collingwood vs Richmond (Collingwood is home)\n- Row 3: Carlton vs Hawthorn\n- Row 4: Melbourne vs Fitzroy (Melbourne is home)\n- Row 5: South Melbourne vs Essendon\n\nSo, for Collingwood as the home team, their score is in row 2. Their score is listed as \"11.15  (81)\". I believe this format represents goals and behinds, with the total points in parentheses. So Collingwood's score is 81.\n\nFor Melbourne as the home team, their score is in row 4: \"18.18  (126)\". Their total points are 126.\n\nNow, comparing these two scores: Collingwood has 81, and Melbourne has 126. Since 81 is less than 126, the claim that Collingwood's home score is lower than Melbourne's is TRUE.\n\nI need to identify the relevant cells from the table that support this conclusion. For Collingwood, it's row 2, column \"home team score\". For Melbourne, it's row 4, same column. So the relevant_cells would include these two entries.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Collingwood scored 81 points at home, which is lower than Melbourne's 126 points as a home team.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"mcg venue have a higher crowd than prince park\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim refers to.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two venues: \"mcg\" and \"prince park.\" Looking at the table columns, I see there's a \"venue\" column that lists different venues for each game. Also, there's a \"crowd\" column which shows the number of people who attended each match.\n\nSo my task is to find the crowd numbers for both McG and Prince Park and compare them. If McG has a higher crowd than Prince Park, the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nLooking through the data rows:\n\n1. The first row has \"arden street oval\" as the venue with a crowd of 11000.\n2. The second row is at \"western oval\" with 14000 people.\n3. The third row is at \"victoria park\" with 30000 attendees.\n4. The fourth row mentions \"princes park\" and the crowd size here is 10000.\n5. The fifth row has the venue as \"mcg\" with a crowd of 13562.\n6. The last row is at \"lake oval\" with 16000 people.\n\nSo, focusing on \"princes park\" and \"mcg\":\n\n- Prince Park: Row index 3 (since rows are zero-indexed), the crowd is 10000.\n- McG: Row index 4, the crowd is 13562.\n\nComparing these two numbers, 13562 (McG) is indeed higher than 10000 (Prince Park). Therefore, the claim that McG has a higher crowd than Prince Park is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant for this determination. The relevant information comes from the \"venue\" and \"crowd\" columns for both venues mentioned.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- For McG (row 4): \n   - Venue column: row index 4, column name \"venue\".\n   - Crowd count: same row, column name \"crowd\".\n\n- For Prince Park (row 3):\n   - Venue column: row index 3, column name \"venue\".\n   - Crowd count: same row, column name \"crowd\".\n\nPutting this together, the relevant cells are from rows 4 and 3 for both venues and their respective crowd numbers.\n\nI think that's all I need to determine the answer. The claim is TRUE because McG had a higher attendance than Prince Park.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the McG venue has a higher crowd than Prince Park. By examining the table, we find that McG had 13562 attendees while Prince Park had 10000.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim is: \"victoria park venue have the third smallest crowd in the 1928 vfl season.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. All the data seems to be from July 28, 1928.\n\nThe claim mentions Victoria Park venue specifically. Looking through each row, I see that the third row has \"victoria park\" as the venue. The crowd number there is 30,000. \n\nNow, I need to check all the crowds from other venues to determine their order. Let me list them out:\n\n1. Arden Street Oval: 11,000\n2. Western Oval: 14,000\n3. Victoria Park: 30,000\n4. Princes Park: 10,000\n5. MCG: 13,562\n6. Lake Oval: 16,000\n\nI'll sort these crowd numbers from smallest to largest:\n\n- Princes Park: 10,000 (smallest)\n- Arden Street Oval: 11,000\n- MCG: 13,562\n- Western Oval: 14,000\n- Lake Oval: 16,000\n- Victoria Park: 30,000 (largest)\n\nWait a second, the claim says that Victoria Park has the third smallest crowd. But according to this sorted list, Victoria Park is actually the largest, not the third smallest. The third smallest would be MCG with 13,562.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because Victoria Park doesn't have the third smallest crowd; it's the largest among these venues on that date.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Victoria Park has the third smallest crowd.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine if the claim \"essendon have a higher score as an away team than fitzroy by 6.98 point\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the JSON data to understand the structure. The columns are: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row contains data for a specific game on \"28 july 1928.\"\n\nThe claim mentions Essendon as an away team. Looking at the table, I'll search each row's \"away team\" column to find where Essendon is listed.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: Away team is St Kilda.\n- Row 1: Away team is Geelong.\n- Row 2: Away team is Richmond.\n- Row 3: Away team is Hawthorn.\n- Row 4: Away team is Fitzroy.\nWait, no, row 4 shows the away team as Fitzroy? Let me check again.\n\nWait, row 5 has the away team as Essendon. So in row 5:\n\nHome team: South Melbourne\nAway team: Essendon\nEssendon's score: 18.11 (119)\n\nNow, I need to find Fitzroy's score when they were an away team. Looking back at row 4:\n\nRow 4:\nHome team: Melbourne\nAway team: Fitzroy\nFitzroy's score: 11.13 (79)\n\nSo Essendon scored 119 points as an away team, and Fitzroy scored 79 points as an away team in their respective games.\n\nThe claim says Essendon's score is higher by 6.98 points. Let me calculate the difference:\n\n119 (Essendon) - 79 (Fitzroy) = 40 points.\n\nWait, that's a significant difference, not 6.98. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the scoring format. The scores are listed as \"11.12 (78)\" etc., which likely represents goals and behinds in Australian rules football. Each goal is worth 6 points, and each behind is 1 point.\n\nLet me recalculate using this understanding:\n\nFor Essendon's score: 18.11 (119)\nGoals: 18 * 6 = 108\nBehinds: 11 * 1 = 11\nTotal: 108 + 11 = 119 points. That matches the given total.\n\nFor Fitzroy's score: 11.13 (79)\nGoals: 11 * 6 = 66\nBehinds: 13 * 1 = 13\nTotal: 66 + 13 = 79 points. This also matches.\n\nSo the difference is indeed 119 - 79 = 40 points, not 6.98.\n\nWait, maybe the claim refers to something else? Let me check again. The claim says \"higher score as an away team than fitzroy by 6.98 point.\"\n\nBut according to the data, Essendon scored 119, Fitzroy 79. So the difference is 40 points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in calculating the difference or misrepresented the scores. The numbers don't align with the claim's assertion of a 6.98 point difference.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Essendon scored 119 as an away team against Melbourne (wait no, row 4: home team is Melbourne, away is Fitzroy. Wait, I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, let me clarify each row:\n\nRow 0:\nHome: North Melbourne\nAway: St Kilda\n\nRow 1:\nHome: Footscray\nAway: Geelong\n\nRow 2:\nHome: Collingwood\nAway: Richmond\n\nRow 3:\nHome: Carlton\nAway: Hawthorn\n\nRow 4:\nHome: Melbourne\nAway: Fitzroy\n\nRow 5:\nHome: South Melbourne\nAway: Essendon\n\nSo in row 4, Fitzroy is the away team with a score of 11.13 (79).\n\nIn row 5, Essendon is the away team with a score of 18.11 (119).\n\nThe claim states that Essendon's away score is higher than Fitzroy's by 6.98 points.\n\nBut as calculated:\n\nEssendon: 119\nFitzroy:79\n\nDifference: 40 points.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because the actual difference is 40 points, not approximately 7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the score format. Let me check if \"6.98\" refers to goals and behinds. 6 goals would be 36 points, but that doesn't align with the numbers.\n\nWait, maybe the user meant 40 points as 6.98? That doesn't make sense numerically. Alternatively, perhaps a miscalculation in decimal terms?\n\nNo, I think it's clear that the difference is 40 points, so the claim of a 6.98 point difference is false.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Essendon scored higher than Fitzroy by approximately 7 points as away teams, but according to the data, the difference was actually 40 points.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"st kilda have the lowest score as a home team in the 1928 vfl season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim is saying. It states that St Kilda has the lowest score when they were the home team during the 1928 VFL season. So, my task is to check all instances where St Kilda was the home team and compare their scores with other home teams in the same table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", \"away team score\", \"venue\", \"crowd\", and \"date\". The data is provided for each match on 28 July 1928. There are six rows of data.\n\nI'll start by identifying all the matches where St Kilda was the home team. Scanning through each row's \"home team\" column:\n\n- Row 0: Home team is North Melbourne.\n- Row 1: Home team is Footscray.\n- Row 2: Home team is Collingwood.\n- Row 3: Home team is Carlton.\n- Row 4: Home team is Melbourne.\n- Row 5: Home team is South Melbourne.\n\nWait, none of these rows have St Kilda as the home team. That's odd because St Kilda appears in the \"away team\" column for row 0. So, according to this table, St Kilda was an away team in one match on that date but wasn't a home team in any other matches listed here.\n\nThe claim is about St Kilda as a home team having the lowest score. However, since they aren't listed as the home team in any row of this table, there's no data to support that part of the claim. The scores provided are for when other teams were at home.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, the claim can't be verified because St Kilda didn't play as a home team in these matches. Additionally, since they weren't a home team, we can infer that the claim is incorrect because there's no data point where St Kilda was the home team with any score to compare.\n\nSo, I would conclude that the claim is FALSE because there's no evidence of St Kilda being a home team in these matches and thus can't have the lowest score as a home team.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"collingwood have a lower score as an away team than fitzroy.\" My task is to determine if this statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It has columns like \"home team,\" \"home team score,\" \"away team,\" \"away team score,\" and others. Each row represents a match between two teams, with their respective scores.\n\nThe claim mentions Collingwood as an away team and Fitzroy also as a team. So I need to find where Collingwood is listed as the away team and where Fitzroy is the away or home team to compare their scores.\n\nLooking through the data rows:\n\n1. The first row has Collingwood not mentioned at all.\n2. The second row: Footscray vs Geelong, no mention of either team in the claim.\n3. Third row: Collingwood is the home team against Richmond. Their score here is \"11.15 (81).\" But the claim refers to Collingwood as an away team, so this doesn't apply.\n4. Fourth and fifth rows don't involve Collingwood or Fitzroy as away teams.\n5. Sixth row: South Melbourne vs Essendon, again no mention of either.\n\nWait, that's all six rows, but I didn't find any instance where Collingwood is the away team. The only time Collingwood appears is in the third row as the home team against Richmond. So there's no data point where Collingwood is playing away.\n\nNow, looking for Fitzroy: They appear as the away team in the fifth row, where Melbourne is the home team. Their score is \"11.13 (79).\" But without a corresponding score for Collingwood as an away team, I can't compare the two.\n\nSince there's no data on Collingwood being an away team, we don't have enough information to support or refute the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the given table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"mcg venue have a higher crowd than lake oval\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a different match with details like teams, scores, venue, crowd size, etc.\n\nThe claim compares the crowd sizes of two venues: mcg and lake oval. I need to find the rows where the venue is \"mcg\" and another where it's \"lake oval\".\n\nLooking through the data:\n- The first row has Arden Street Oval with 11000 people.\n- Second row at Western Oval, 14000.\n- Third at Victoria Park, 30000.\n- Fourth at Princes Park, 10000.\n- Fifth at mcg, crowd is 13562.\n- Sixth at Lake Oval, crowd is 16000.\n\nSo, mcg has a crowd of 13,562 and lake oval has 16,000. Comparing these numbers, 13,562 is less than 16,000. Therefore, the claim that mcg has a higher crowd than lake oval is false.\n\nI should also note the relevant cells for each venue:\n- For mcg: row index 4, column \"crowd\".\n- For lake oval: row index 5, column \"crowd\".\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE with those two cells highlighted.\n</think>\n\nThe claim compares the crowd sizes at mcg and lake oval. From the table, mcg had a crowd of 13562 while lake oval had 16000, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"essendon have a higher score as an away team than hawthorn by 6.35 point\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. Essendon and Hawthorn are both teams mentioned in the data. The claim states that Essendon's away score is higher than Hawthorn's away score by exactly 6.35 points.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see columns for \"home team,\" \"home team score,\" \"away team,\" \"away team score,\" etc. So each row represents a game between two teams on a specific date at a venue with respective scores and crowd numbers.\n\nI need to find the rows where Essendon is the away team and where Hawthorn is the away team because the claim is about their scores as away teams.\n\nLooking through the data:\n- The first row has St Kilda as the away team. Not relevant.\n- The second row: Geelong is away, so no.\n- Third row: Richmond is away, not either of them.\n- Fourth row: Hawthorn is the away team against Carlton. Their score is \"11.13 (79)\". \n- Fifth row: Fitzroy is away, so not relevant.\n- Sixth row: Essendon is the away team against South Melbourne. Their score is \"18.11 (119)\".\n\nWait, but wait a second. In the fourth row, Hawthorn is the away team with a score of 79 points because their score is written as \"11.13 (79)\". The format seems to be goals.behinds (total points). So, each goal is worth 6 points, and each behind is worth 1 point. But in this case, it's already given the total in parentheses, so 11 goals and 13 behinds would be (11*6)+(13)=79.\n\nSimilarly, Essendon's score as away team is \"18.11 (119)\", which adds up to (18*6)+11=108+11=119 points.\n\nNow, the claim says that Essendon's away score is higher than Hawthorn's by 6.35 points. Let me check the difference between their scores.\n\nEssendon's score: 119\nHawthorn's score:79\n\nDifference: 119 -79=40 points.\n\nBut the claim states a difference of 6.35 points, which is much lower than 40. That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake because in some sports, like Australian Rules Football, scoring can include different types of goals and behinds. However, in this table, each away team's score is given as total points in parentheses, so the numbers are already calculated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's confusion between teams playing at home or away. Let me check again:\n\nIn the fourth row: Home team is Carlton (score 149), Away team is Hawthorn (79). So Hawthorn scored 79 as away.\nIn the sixth row: Home team is South Melbourne (83), Away team is Essendon (119). So Essendon's score is 119 as away.\n\nDifference in their away scores is 40 points. But the claim says a difference of 6.35 points, which doesn't match. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, to list the relevant cells:\n- For Hawthorn as away team: row 3 (index starts at 0?), wait no, let's check the data array indices:\n\nWait, in the given JSON, the data has six rows. Let me count them:\n\nRow 0: North Melbourne vs St Kilda\nRow 1: Footscray vs Geelong\nRow 2: Collingwood vs Richmond\nRow 3: Carlton vs Hawthorn\nRow 4: Melbourne vs Fitzroy\nRow 5: South Melbourne vs Essendon\n\nWait, no. Looking at the JSON data array:\n\nFirst element is [north melbourne, ..., st kilda], that's row 0.\n\nSo, in row 3 (index 3), Carlton is home against Hawthorn, so away team is Hawthorn with score 79.\n\nIn row 5, South Melbourne is home against Essendon, so away team is Essendon with score 119.\n\nWait no: Wait, looking at the data array:\n\nRow indices are from 0 to 5.\n\nLooking back, in row 3 (index 3), it's Carlton vs Hawthorn. Home team is Carlton, away team is Hawthorn. Their scores: home score is 22.17 (149), away is 11.13 (79).\n\nIn row 5 (index 5): South Melbourne is home against Essendon. Away team is Essendon with score 18.11 (119). \n\nSo, to find the relevant cells:\n\n- For Hawthorn's away score: row 3, column \"away team score\" which is 79.\n- For Essendon's away score: row 5, column \"away team score\" which is 119.\n\nThus, the difference is indeed 40 points, not 6.35. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nSo, in terms of JSON output:\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row index 3, \"away team score\"\n- Row index 5, \"away team score\"\n\nTherefore, answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
