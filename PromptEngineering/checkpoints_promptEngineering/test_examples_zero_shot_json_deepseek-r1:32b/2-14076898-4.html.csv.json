The claim says: \"there be only 2 occasion when a team drew and it have a goal difference of 34  - 25 and 36  - 29\".\n\nFirst, let me break down what the claim is saying. It's stating that there are exactly two instances where a team had a draw (meaning they didn't win or lose, so drawn=1), and those two teams have specific goal differences: one with 34-25 and another with 36-29.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table to verify this. The columns are \"games\", \"drawn\", \"lost\", \"goal difference\", and \"points\". Each row represents a team's performance.\n\nI'll go through each row and check if the 'drawn' column is 1 because that indicates a draw. Then, for those rows where drawn=1, I'll look at the goal differences.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nRow 0: games=7, drawn=0 (so not a draw)\nRow 1: drawn=0\nRow 2: drawn=0\nRow 3: drawn=1 \u2192 check goal difference here is \"34 - 25\" which matches one of the claim's values.\nRow 4: drawn=1 \u2192 goal difference is \"36 - 29\", which matches the other value in the claim.\nRow 5: drawn=0\nRow 6: drawn=0\nRow 7: drawn=0\n\nSo, rows 3 and 4 are the only ones where drawn=1. Their goal differences are exactly as claimed: \"34 - 25\" and \"36 - 29\". There's no other row with a draw, so there are exactly two occasions.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"when the goal difference be 11 - 71 the point be 0\". \n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. The claim is saying that if a team has a goal difference of 11-71, then their points should be 0. I need to check the table to see if any row matches these conditions.\n\nLooking at the JSON data, each row represents a different team's performance with columns: games, drawn, lost, goal difference, and points. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. First row: goal difference is 51-10, points are 12. Not relevant.\n2. Second row: 40-13, points 12. Not relevant.\n3. Third row: 41-19, points 10. Still not matching the claim.\n4. Fourth row: 34-25, points 7. Nope.\n5. Fifth row: 36-29, points 7. Doesn't match either.\n6. Sixth row: 32-27, points 6. Not the case here.\n7. Seventh row: 17-68, points 2.

That matches exactly what the claim is saying. So when the goal difference is 11-71, the points are indeed 0.\n\nSo, checking this against all rows confirms that in the eighth row (row index 7), both conditions hold true: the goal difference is 11-71 and the points are 0.

The claim says: \"there be never a time when point be greater than 12 and only 1 occasion when the point be less than 2.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe first part is about whether any team has points greater than 12. Looking at the table, I'll check the \"points\" column for all rows. The points are as follows:\n- Row 0: 12\n- Row 1: 12\n- Rows 2 to 7 have 10, 7, 7, 6, 2, 0 respectively.\n\nSo, no team has more than 12 points. This part of the claim holds true because all points are at or below 12.\n\nNext, the second part states there's only one occasion where points are less than 2. I need to find how many rows have points < 2. Looking again:\n- Row 6 has 2 points (which is equal to 2, so not less)\n- Row 7 has 0 points.\n\nOnly row 7 has points less than 2. So this part of the claim is also true because there's exactly one instance where points are below 2.\n\nTherefore, both conditions in the claim are satisfied.

The task is to determine whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the table. The table has five columns: \"games\", \"drawn\", \"lost\", \"goal difference\", and \"points\". There are eight rows of data under these columns.\n\nThe claim states: \"when the point be 12 the goal difference be 51 - 10 and 40 - 13.\" So, I need to verify if whenever the points column has a value of 12, the corresponding \"goal difference\" entries are either \"51 - 10\" or \"40 - 13\".\n\nTo approach this, I'll go through each row in the data array and check where the points equal 12. For those rows, I'll then look at the \"goal difference\" to see if it matches either of the two specified values.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Row 0: points = 12, goal difference = \"51 - 10\"\n- Row 1: points = 12, goal difference = \"40 - 13\"\n\nThese are both rows where points are 12, and their goal differences match exactly what the claim states.\n\nRows 2 to 7 have points less than 12, so they don't affect this particular claim. Therefore, for all instances where points equal 12, the goal difference is either \"51 - 10\" or \"40 - 13\", which aligns perfectly with the claim.\n\nSince every occurrence of 12 points corresponds to one of the two specified goal differences and there are no discrepancies, the claim holds true.

Row 0: Points = 12, Lost = 1 \u2192 Doesn't meet both conditions.\n2. Row 1: Points = 12, Lost = 1 \u2192 Doesn't meet.\n3. Row 2: Points = 10, Lost = 2 \u2192 Doesn't meet.\n4.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I've been given a table in JSON format and a specific claim to verify. The goal is to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. The columns are \"games\", \"drawn\", \"lost\", \"goal difference\", and \"points\". There are 8 rows of data under these columns. Each row represents a team's performance over some games, with stats like number of drawn matches, lost matches, goal difference, and points earned.\n\nNow, looking at the claim: \"there be 3 occasion when a team drew and it have a goal difference of 34 -25 and 36 -29\". Hmm, I need to parse this correctly. The wording is a bit off, but I think it's saying that there are three instances where teams had draws with specific goal differences.\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim says \"a team drew\" so perhaps it refers to teams that have drawn matches. But looking at the table, each row represents a single team or entity, not multiple games. So maybe it's referring to three different teams that have drawn some number of times and have these goal differences.\n\nSo, let me break down the claim into parts:\n\n1. There are 3 occasions where a team drew.\n2. These occasions correspond to goal differences of 34-25 and 36-29.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting because two different goal differences can't be three occasions unless some teams share the same goal difference. Let me re-examine the claim again: \"there be 3 occasion when a team drew and it have a goal difference of 34 -25 and 36 -29\". So perhaps there are three teams that drew, each with either 34-25 or 36-29 as their goal differences.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is trying to say that there are three occasions where teams drew and had these specific goal differences. But since each row represents a team's overall performance, not individual game results, it might be that we're looking for teams that have drawn matches (i.e., \"drawn\" column > 0) and whose total goal difference is either 34-25 or 36-29.\n\nSo let me check each row in the table:\n\nRow 0:\n- games:7, drawn:0. So no draws here. Doesn't fit.\n\nRow1:\n- games:7, drawn:0. No draws.\n\nRow2:\n- games:7, drawn:0. Still no draws.\n\nRow3:\n- games:7, drawn:1. Yes, a draw.\n- goal difference: \"34 - 25\". That's one of the specified goal differences.\n\nRow4:\n- games:7, drawn:1. Another draw.\n- goal difference: \"36 - 29\". The other specified goal difference.\n\nRow5:\n- games:7, drawn:0. No draws.\n\nRows6 and 7:\n- both have drawn:0. So no draws here either.\n\nSo, from the table, we have two teams that drew (rows 3 and 4), each with different goal differences (34-25 and 36-29). But the claim states there are three such occasions. Since only two rows meet the criteria of having drawn matches with these specific goal differences, the claim is not fully supported.\n\nWait a minute\u2014I might have miscounted. Let me double-check each row:\n\nRow0: drawn=0 \u2192 no\nRow1: drawn=0 \u2192 no\nRow2: drawn=0 \u2192 no\nRow3: drawn=1, GD=34-25 \u2192 yes\nRow4: drawn=1, GD=36-29 \u2192 yes\nRows5-7: drawn=0 or 4,6,7 which are more than 0 but the claim is about having a draw (drawn \u22651), so rows5 has drawn=0? Wait no, row5's data is [7,0,4,\"32 - 27\",6], so drawn=0. Similarly, rows6 and 7 have drawn=0 as well.\n\nSo only rows3 and 4 meet the condition of having a draw (drawn \u22651) and specific GDs mentioned. That's two teams, not three. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there are only two such occasions, not three.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that only two teams have drawn matches with the specified goal differences, not three.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is saying that if a team has a goal difference of 11-71 (which I assume is goals for minus goals against), then their points should be 1.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different team or perhaps different matches.

Points here are 12.\nRow 1: \"40 - 13\", still not a match. Points are 12.\nRow 2: \"41 - 19\" \u2013 nope. Points 10.\nRow 3: \"34 - 25\" \u2013 again, not matching. Points 7.\nRow 4: \"36 - 29\" \u2013 still not the target. Points 7.\nRow 5: \"32 - 27\" \u2013 no match here either. Points are 6.\nRow 6: \"17 - 68\" \u2013 close, but not exactly \"11 - 71\". Points are 2.\nRow 7: Here it is! The goal difference is \"11 - 71\", which matches the claim. Now, I check the points column for this row. It says 0.\n\nSo according to the table, when the goal difference is 11-71, the team has 0 points, not 1 as claimed.

It seems to state that for any row where the points are 13, the goal difference should be either \"51 - 10\" or \"40 - 13.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I'll examine each row to see if there are any entries with 13 points.\n\nRow by row:\n- Row 0: Points = 12\n- Row 1: Points = 12\n- Row 2: Points = 10\n- Row 3: Points = 7\n- Row 4: Points = 7\n- Row 5: Points = 6\n- Row 6: Points = 2\n- Row 7: Points = 0\n\nNone of the rows have points equal to 13. So, there are no instances where points are 13 in this table.\n\nSince there's no data supporting the claim (because no row has 13 points), the claim isn't supported by the given data. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, regarding relevant cells: I need to check all rows for points equal to 13, which are columns \"points\" in each row. However, since none of them have 13, perhaps the relevant cells would include where points were closest or how the claim relates to other columns. But since the condition isn't met, maybe only the points column is relevant across all rows.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions goal differences when points are 13. Since there's no such row, the relevant cells might be all points columns and the corresponding goal difference where applicable. Alternatively, perhaps just checking for any occurrence of points=13 would suffice, but in this case, none exist.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells should include each row's \"points\" column to check if they equal 13. Additionally, since no rows meet the condition, there are no specific goal differences to reference, so maybe only the points columns are considered relevant for verifying the claim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is about whether when a team has certain goal differences, their points are 13. But that's not how the claim is phrased. It says when points are 13, the goal difference should be these values. Since there are no points=13 rows, the claim isn't supported.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the answer is FALSE because there's no row with points equal to 13. The relevant cells would include all \"points\" columns from each row since we checked them for the condition.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim says: \"there be 3 times when the point be 7 and the number of loss be 3 each time.\" So, it's saying that in three different rows (teams?), both points equal 7 and losses equal 3. \n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are games, drawn, lost, goal difference, points. The claim mentions two specific conditions: points being 7 and losses being 3.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Points = 12, Losses =1 \u2192 Doesn't meet either condition.\n2. **Row 1**: Points =12, Losses=1 \u2192 Same as above.\n3. **Row 2**: Points=10, Losses=2 \u2192 No.\n4. **Row 3**: Points=7, Losses=3 \u2192 This matches both conditions. So this is one instance.\n5. **Row 4**: Points=7, Losses=3 \u2192 Another match. Now we have two instances.\n6. **Row 5**: Points=6, Losses=4 \u2192 No.\n7. **Row 6**: Points=2, Losses=6 \u2192 No.\n8. **Row 7**: Points=0, Losses=7 \u2192 No.\n\nWait, but the table data only has 8 rows as per the JSON provided, with indexes from 0 to 7. So in total, I found two rows where both points are 7 and losses are 3 (rows 3 and 4). That's only two instances, not three.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake counting? Let me check again:\n\n- Row 3: Points=7, Losses=3 \u2192 yes.\n- Row 4: Points=7, Losses=3 \u2192 yes.\n- Any others?\n\nLooking back at the data array:\nThe fifth row (index 4) is [7,1,3,\"36 - 29\",7]. So that's another one. \n\nWait, how many rows have points=7 and losses=3? Let me count:\n\nRow 3: yes\nRow 4: yes\n\nThat's only two rows. Therefore, the claim says there are three times when both conditions are met, but in reality, it's only two.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE because there aren't three instances, just two.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells:\n\nFor each of the rows that meet points=7 and losses=3, I need to list their \"points\" and \"lost\" columns.\n\nRows 3 and 4 both have points=7 and lost=3. So their row indexes are 3 and 4, with column names \"points\" and \"lost\".\n\nSo relevant_cells would include:\n\n- {\"row_0\":3, \"column_name\":\"points\"}\n- {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"lost\"}\n- {\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\":\"points\"}\n- {\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\":\"lost\"}\n\nWait, but the JSON structure requires each object to have \"row_index\" and \"column_name\". So for row 3: points (7) and lost (3). Similarly for row 4.\n\nBut wait, in the initial data:\n\nRow 3 is [7,1,3,\"34 -25\",7]. So points=7, lost=3.\n\nRow 4 is [7,1,3,\"36 -29\",7]. Same here: points=7, lost=3.\n\nSo each of these rows has the required conditions. But since there are only two such rows, not three, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are three instances where a team has 7 points and 3 losses. However, upon reviewing the table, only two such teams meet this criteria (rows 3 and 4). Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
