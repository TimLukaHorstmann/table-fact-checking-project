    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let me break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"there be 1 woman's double team consist of kerry ann sheppard and carolina harvey when jamie van hooijdonk compete in the men's single.\"\n\nFirst, I'll identify each part of the claim:\n\n1. A women's doubles team consisting of Kerry Ann Sheppard and Carolina Harvey.\n2. This should occur during a season where Jamie Van Hooijdonk is competing in the men's singles.\n\nI'll start by looking for Jamie Van Hooijdonk in the \"men's singles\" column. Scanning through each row, I see that in 2009, the men's singles champion is Jamie van hooijdonk (note: the exact spelling might vary; need to check case sensitivity).\n\nNow, checking the same row for women's doubles. In 2009, the women's doubles entry is \"kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey.\" That matches exactly with what the claim states.\n\nSo both conditions are met in the 2009 row. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"womens doubles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the womens double team, kerry ann sheppard and caroline harvey compete in the same year as when jamie van hooijdonk compete in men single.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down what we're looking for. We need to find two things:\n\n1. In which year did Jamie van Hooijdonk compete in Men's Singles?\n2. In that same year, were Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey competing as the Women's Doubles team?\n\nLet me look at the table provided. The columns are season, men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, mixed doubles.\n\nLooking for Jamie van Hooijdonk in Men's Singles. Let me scan through each row under \"men's singles\" column:\n\n- 2000: richard vaughan\n- 2001: richard vaughan\n- 2002: richard vaughan\n- 2003: irwansyah\n- 2004: irwansyah\n- 2005: paul le tocq\n- 2006: martyn lewis\n- 2007: raj popat\n- 2008: martyn lewis\n- 2009: jamie van hooijdonk\n- 2010: irwansyah\n\nSo Jamie van Hooijdonk is in Men's Singles in the year 2009.\n\nNow, I need to check if in 2009, the Women's Doubles team was Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey.\n\nLooking at row index 8 (since rows start from 0) which corresponds to the season 2009. The column for women's doubles is \"kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey\". Yes, that's exactly what we're looking for.\n\nSo both events happened in the same year, 2009. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"womens doubles\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"there be zero woman's double team that compete when jamie van hooijdonk compete.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It claims that whenever Jamie Van Hooijdonk competes in men's singles, there are no women's doubles teams competing. So I need to check if in any year Jamie was in men's singles, were there also entries in women's doubles.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are \"season\", \"mens singles\", \"womens singles\", \"mens doubles\", \"womens doubles\", and \"mixed doubles\". The data spans from 2000 to 2010.\n\nI'll go through each row (each year) and check if Jamie Van Hooijdonk is in the men's singles column. Then, for those years, I'll see if there are any entries in women's doubles.\n\nStarting with each season:\n\n- 2000: Men's singles is Richard Vaughan. Not Jamie.\n- 2001: Same as above.\n- 2002: Still Richard Vaughan.\n- 2003: Irwansyah.\n- 2004: Irwansyah again.\n- 2005: Paul le Tocq.\n- 2006: Martyn Lewis.\n- 2007: Raj Popat.\n- 2008: Martyn Lewis.\n- 2009: Jamie Van Hooijdonk is here. Now, check women's doubles for this year (2009). The entry is \"kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey\". So there are two women in the women's doubles team.\n\nSince in 2009, when Jamie competed, there was a women's doubles team, the claim that there were zero such teams is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because in 2009, when Jamie Van Hooijdonk competed, there was a women's doubles team. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"womens doubles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
