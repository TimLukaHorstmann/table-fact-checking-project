    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim \"the 2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier be play in rizai memorial stadium , manila\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to identify the key elements we need to verify:\n- Competition: 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier\n- Venue: Rizal Memorial Stadium, Manila\n\nNext, I'll go through each row in the table to see if there's a match for both of these criteria.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nRow indices 14 and 15 mention \"2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier\" as the competition. Let's check their venues:\n- Row 14: Venue is \"leo palace resort soccer field , yona\"\n- Row 15: Venue is also \"leo palace resort soccer field , yona\"\n\nNeither of these rows list Rizal Memorial Stadium, Manila. Instead, row 16 has the venue as \"rizal memorial stadium , manila\", but its competition is \"2012 philippine peace cup\", not the 2013 qualifier.\n\nTherefore, there's no row where both the competition and venue match the claim. The claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table in JSON format. The claim is: \"the 2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier be play in leo palace resort soccer field , yona.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what the claim is stating. It's saying that the match for the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup qualifier was held at Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field in Yona.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has columns: date, venue, score, result, and competition. My task is to find a row where the competition is \"2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier\" and check if the venue matches the one mentioned in the claim.\n\nI'll go through each data row:\n\n1. Rows 0-5 don't have the 2013 competition.\n2. Row 6: It's a qualifier for 2008 AFC Challenge Cup, not relevant.\n3. Rows 7-9: These are related to East Asian Football Championship qualifiers in 2008 and 2010, so no match for 2013.\n4. Rows 10-15:\n   - Row 10: Venue is Leo Palace Resort, competition is 2010 qualifier.\n   - Row 11: Same venue, but it's the 2010 AFC Challenge qualifier.\n   - Row 12: Different location, MFF in Ulan Bator, not relevant.\n   - Rows 13-15: These are about 2012 and 2013 EAFF qualifiers. Specifically:\n     - Row 14 has \"2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier\" as competition. The venue here is Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field, Yona.\n     - So this row matches the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there's a match in row 14 where the competition and venue align with what's claimed.\n\nNow, compiling the relevant cells: the row index is 14, and we check both 'venue' and 'competition' columns. The other rows don't contribute to supporting this specific claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"venue\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"competition\" }\n   ]\n}\n```",
