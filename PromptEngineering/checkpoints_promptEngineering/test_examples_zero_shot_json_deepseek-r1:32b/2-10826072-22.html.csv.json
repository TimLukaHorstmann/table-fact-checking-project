    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the home game of essendon have a small crowd of 12865\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the table. The columns are: \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", \"away team score\", \"venue\", \"crowd\", and \"date\". Each row represents a different game played on August 28, 1971.\n\nThe claim is about Essendon's home game having a small crowd of 12,865. I need to check two main things here: whether Essendon was the home team in any of these games and what the crowd number was for that particular game.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. The first row has Hawthorn as the home team. Not relevant.\n2. Second row is Footscray vs. St Kilda. Again, not Essendon.\n3. Third row: Essendon is listed under \"home team\", so this must be their home game. Let me note that down.\n4. Fourth row is Carlton vs. Collingwood; no Essendon here.\n5. Fifth row has South Melbourne as the home team against North Melbourne.\n6. Sixth row is Richmond vs. Geelong.\n\nSo, only the third row mentions Essendon as the home team. Now, checking the crowd for that game: in the \"crowd\" column (which is the sixth element in each data array), it's 12865. \n\nWait a second, the claim says the crowd was small with 12,865. But looking at other games, for example, Richmond had a crowd of 36,423 and Carlton had 32,000. These are significantly larger numbers compared to Essendon's 12,865. So, in context, 12k does seem small.\n\nNow, is there any possibility that Essendon played another home game on the same day? No, each row represents a different game, and only one mentions Essendon as the home team. Therefore, this must be the only relevant game for our claim.\n\nSo, to sum up: The relevant row is index 2 (since indexing starts at 0). Within that row, the \"home team\" column confirms it's Essendon, and the \"crowd\" column shows 12865. Comparing this crowd size with others on the same day, it indeed seems small.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE because the home game of Essendon had a crowd of exactly 12,865, which appears to be smaller than other games listed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the relevant row where Essendon is the home team and noting their crowd size compared to others on the same date.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"on august 28 1971 hawthorn score 18.16 at the glenferrie oval\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It states that on August 28, 1971, Hawthorn scored 18.16 at Glenferrie Oval. I'll need to check each part of this statement against the data in the JSON table.\n\nLooking at the table structure: The columns are \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", \"away team score\", \"venue\", \"crowd\", and \"date\". There are six rows of data, each representing a different match on August 28, 1971.\n\nI'll start by identifying which row corresponds to the Hawthorn game. Scanning through the \"home team\" column:\n\n- Row 0: Home team is Hawthorn.\n- Rows 1 to 5 have other teams as home teams.\n\nSo, the relevant row is index 0.\n\nNext, I need to verify each part of the claim against this row.\n\n1. **Date**: The claim mentions August 28, 1971. Checking the \"date\" column in row 0: It's \"28 august 1971\". This matches exactly, so that's correct.\n\n2. **Home team score**: The claim states Hawthorn scored 18.16. Looking at the \"home team score\" for row 0, it's listed as \"18.16 (124)\". The first part is 18.16, which matches the claim. The number in parentheses is likely the total points or some other metric, but since the claim only mentions 18.16, that part checks out.\n\n3. **Venue**: The claim says the game was at Glenferrie Oval. Checking the \"venue\" column in row 0: It's listed as \"glenferrie oval\". This matches exactly, so that's correct too.\n\nSince all parts of the claim (date, home team score, and venue) are accurately represented in row 0 of the table, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"when the home team score 17.16 , the game be play at glenferrie oval.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It's stating that when the home team scores 17.16, the venue is Glenferrie Oval. So I need to check if there's a row where the home team score is exactly 17.16 and see what the venue is for that game.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has columns: \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", \"away team score\", \"venue\", etc. \n\nI'll go through each data row one by one:\n\n1. First row: Home team is Hawthorn with a score of 18.16 (124). That's not 17.16, so move on.\n2. Second row: Footscray scored 10.14 (74) as home team. Not matching.\n3. Third row: Essendon scored 12.12 (84). Still no match.\n4. Fourth row: Carlton's score is 16.10 (106). Nope.\n5. Fifth row: South Melbourne has a score of 19.17 (131). Close, but not matching the 17.16 in the claim.\n6. Sixth row: Richmond scored 16.14 (110). Again, doesn't match.\n\nWait, none of these rows have a home team score of 17.16. So the claim is saying that when this specific score occurs, it's at Glenferrie Oval. But since there are no such entries where the home team scored exactly 17.16, I can conclude that the claim isn't supported by the data.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cells here would include checking each row's \"home team score\" and \"venue\". Since none of them have the score mentioned in the claim, there are no specific rows to point out as supporting evidence.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is about a home team scoring 17.16 at Glenferrie Oval, but the table doesn't show any such game.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"the away team score 14.18 point when the home team score 17.14 point.\" Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. It has columns like \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", \"away team score\", and others. The data rows are from index 0 to 5.\n\nI need to check each row to see if any of them have an away team score of 14.18 and a home team score of 17.14 in the same match. So, I'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0: Home team is Hawthorn with a score of 18.16 (124). Away team is Melbourne with 8.17 (65). Doesn't match the claim.\n\nRow 1: Footscray vs St Kilda. Home score 10.14 (74), away score 12.18 (90). Not matching.\n\nRow 2: Essendon vs Fitzroy. Scores are 12.12 (84) and 13.17 (95). No match here either.\n\nRow 3: Carlton vs Collingwood. Home score is 16.10 (106), away is 13.9 (87). Not what we're looking for.\n\nRow 4: South Melbourne vs North Melbourne. Home team scores 19.17 (131), away team 8.11 (59). Still no match.\n\nRow 5: Richmond vs Geelong at the MCG with a crowd of 36,423 on the same date. Here, the home team is Richmond with 16.14 (110) and the away team is Geelong with 14.18 (102). Wait a minute, so the home team's score here is 16.14, which is 16 goals and 14 behinds, totaling 110 points. The away team, Geelong, has 14.18 for 102 points.\n\nThe claim says \"the away team score 14.18 point when the home team score 17.14 point.\" But in row 5, the home team scored 16.14 (not 17.14) and the away team scored 14.18. So the away team's score is correct as per the claim, but the home team's score doesn't match because it's 16.14 instead of 17.14.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the scores. In Australian rules football, the score format is goals.behinds (total points). So each goal is worth 6 points and a behind is 1 point. So 16.14 would be (16*6) +14 = 96 +14=110 points. Similarly, 17.14 would be (17*6)+14=102+14=116 points.\n\nLooking back at row 5: home team is Richmond with 16.14 (110), away team Geelong with 14.18 (102). The claim states the away team scored 14.18 when the home team scored 17.14, which would be 116 points for the home team. But in reality, Richmond only scored 16.14 or 110 points.\n\nSo there's no row where the home team has a score of 17.14. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by any data in the table because while Geelong did score 14.18, the corresponding home team didn't have a score of 17.14; instead, it was 16.14.\n\nHence, the claim is FALSE.

The user has provided a table in JSON format and a specific claim to verify: \"the smallest crowd at a home game for essendon be 10865\".

There are six rows of data corresponding to different games on August 28, 1971.\n\nThe claim is about Essendon's home game crowd. So, I need to find the row where Essendon is the home team. Looking at the table, the third row lists Essendon as the home team against Fitzroy. The crowd for that game was 12865.\n\nNext, I'll check if this is indeed the smallest crowd for Essendon's home games. Since there's only one row with Essendon as the home team, this must be the only data point available for their home games on that date. Therefore, the smallest (and only) crowd at a home game for Essendon was 12865.\n\nThe claim states the crowd was 10865, which is incorrect because the actual number is 12865.
