    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to verify the claim: \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did' be the past habitual and \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do' be the probable future.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what each part is claiming.\n\n1. **\"\u0917\u0930\u093f  gari 'you did'\" as the past habitual:**\n   - The claim suggests that \"gari\" means \"you did\" and refers to the past habitual tense. I'll check the table for \"gari\" under the \"past\" column and see if it's associated with \"you did.\" \n\n2. **\"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do'\" as the probable future:**\n   - The claim states that \"garchas\" means \"you (will) do,\" implying a probable future tense. I'll look for \"garchas\" in the table and see if it's categorized under the probable future.\n\nNow, examining the table:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- **Row 3: Third person singular low-grade**\n   - The form \"\u0917\u0930\u093f  gari\" is listed with 'he did' which matches the past tense but not specifically as a habitual. However, in some contexts, past tense can imply a single action rather than a habit.\n\n- **Row 2: Second person singular low-grade**\n   - Here, \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\" is present, meaning 'you (will) do.' This aligns with the probable future as per the claim.\n\nBut wait, in the table, \"gari\" under third person singular indicates past but not necessarily habitual. The claim specifies \"past habitual,\" which might require a different form or context. \n\nMoreover, looking at other rows:\n\n- **Row 4: Third person middle-grade/plural masculine**\n   - Here, \"\u0917\u0930\u0947 gar\u00e9\" is listed for 'they did.' Not relevant here.\n\n- **Row 1: Second person singular low-grade**\n   - \"\u0917\u0930\u093f  gari\" in the past column corresponds to 'you did' (past tense), but not specifically habitual. The probable future is correctly noted as \"garchas.\"\n\nSo, while \"garchas\" aligns with the probable future, \"gari\" may just be a simple past rather than a past habitual. Therefore, the claim might not be fully supported because it conflates past tense with past habitual.\n\nThus, I think the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 3,\n       \"column_name\": \"past\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 2,\n       \"column_name\": \"future probable\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares  'may you do' be the imperative and \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari  'you did' be the past habitual.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down what each part of the claim is referring to.\n\nThe first part is about \"gares\" being the imperative form meaning 'may you do'. In English grammar, imperatives are commands or requests. So in Nepali (as per the data), the imperative would typically be a direct command or request.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll need to find where the imperative forms are listed. The columns in each row seem to represent different grammatical categories. Let me check the column names: \"Imperative\", \"Future\", \"Past\", \"Past Habitual\", and \"Conditional\".\n\nWait, actually looking back at the table structure, it's a bit unclear because the user only provided the data without explicit column headers beyond \"row_index\". Each row seems to represent different grammatical persons (like first person, second person singular, etc.), and within each row, there are five cells corresponding to different tenses or moods: Imperative, Future, Past, Past Habitual, Conditional.\n\nWait no, actually looking at the data provided, it's a table where each row is a category like \"first person singular\", \"second person plural\", etc., and each cell under that row lists different forms. The columns are labeled in the first row as [\"Imperative\", \"Future\", \"Past\", \"Past Habitual\", \"Conditional\"].\n\nSo for example, row 0 is \"First person singular\" with cells like \"\u0917\u0930\u0942 garu\" under Imperative, etc.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific forms: \"gares\" and \"gari\". Let's see where these appear in the table.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. First row (row_index=0): First person singular.\n   - Imperative: \u0917\u0930\u0942\n   - Future: \u091c\u0917\u0947\u0915\u094b \u091b\u0941\n   - Past: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0915\u094b \u091b\u0941\n   - Past Habitual: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u090f\u0915\u094b \u0925\u093f\u092f\u094b\n   - Conditional: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0947\u091b\u0941\n\n2. Second row (row_index=1): First person plural.\n   - Imperative: \u0917\u0930\u094c\u0902\n   - Future: \u091c\u0917\u0947\u0915\u093e \u091b\u094c\u0902\n   - Past: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0915\u093e \u091b\u094c\u0902\n   - Past Habitual: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u090f\u0915\u093e \u0925\u093f\u090f\n   - Conditional: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0947\u091b\u094c\u0902\n\n3. Third row (row_index=2): Second person singular.\n   - Imperative: \u0917\u0930\n   - Future: \u091c\u0917\u0947\u0915\u094b \u091b\u0948\n   - Past: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0915\u094b \u091b\u0948\n   - Past Habitual: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u090f\u0915\u094b \u0925\u093f\u092f\u094b\n   - Conditional: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0947\u091b\n\n4.

Fifth row (row_index=4): Second person respectful singular.\n   - Imperative: \u0917\u0930\u0942\u0901\u091b\u0941\n   - Future: \u091c\u0917\u0947\u0915\u094b \u091b\u0942\u0901\n   - Past: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0915\u094b \u0925\u093f\u092f\u094b\n   - Past Habitual: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u090f\u0915\u094b \u0925\u093f\u0907\u090f\n   - Conditional: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0947\u091b\u0941\n\n6. Sixth row (row_index=5): Third person singular.\n   - Imperative: \u0917\u0930\u0947\n   - Future: \u091c\u0917\u0947\u0915\u094b \u091b\u0948\n   - Past: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0915\u094b \u091b\u0948\n   - Past Habitual: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u090f\u0915\u094b \u0925\u093f\u092f\u094b\n   - Conditional: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0947\u091b\n\n7. Seventh row (row_index=6): Third person plural.\n   - Imperative: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u093f\n   - Future: \u091c\u0917\u0947\u0915\u093e \u091b\u0928\u094d\n   - Past: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0915\u093e \u091b\u0928\u094d\n   - Past Habitual: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u090f\u0915\u093e \u0925\u093f\u090f\n   - Conditional: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0947\u091b\u0928\u094d\n\nLooking for \"gares\" and \"gari\":\n\n- \"gares\" doesn't seem to appear in the Imperative column of any row. The closest is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\" (gare) in row 5, which is under third person singular, Imperative.\n\nWait, but the user's claim mentions \"gares\" as imperative. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe \"gares\" isn't directly in the Imperative column but elsewhere. Wait, looking at row_index=6 (third person plural), under Imperative it's \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u093f\", which might be a typo for \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0915\u093e\" or similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing it. Let me check each cell:\n\nLooking through all the Imperative cells:\n- row0: \u0917\u0930\u0942\n- row1: \u0917\u0930\u094c\u0902\n- row2: \u0917\u0930\n- row3: \u0917\u0930\u094c\u0902\n- row4: \u0917\u0930\u0942\u0901\u091b\u0941\n- row5: \u0917\u0930\u0947\n- row6: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u093f\n\nNo \"gares\" in Imperative. So perhaps the claim is incorrect here.\n\nNow, for \"gari\" as past habitual. Let's check the Past Habitual column:\n\nLooking through each row under Past Habitual:\n- row0: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u090f\u0915\u094b \u0925\u093f\u092f\u094b\n- row1: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u090f\u0915\u093e \u0925\u093f\u090f\n- row2: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u090f\u0915\u094b \u0925\u093f\u092f\u094b\n- row3: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u090f\u0915\u093e \u0925\u093f\u090f\n- row4: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u090f\u0915\u094b \u0925\u093f\u0907\u090f\n- row5: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u090f\u0915\u094b \u0925\u093f\u092f\u094b\n- row6: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u090f\u0915\u093e \u0925\u093f\u090f\n\nNone of these are \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\" (gari). The forms are longer, like \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u090f\u0915\u094b\" or \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u090f\u0915\u093e\".\n\nSo the claim says \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari  'you did' be the past habitual.\" But in the table, under Past Habitual for second person singular (row2), it's \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u090f\u0915\u094b \u0925\u093f\u092f\u094b\", not \"gari\". So that part is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect. The imperative form isn't \"gares\" as per the table, and the past habitual isn't \"gari\".\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misinterpreting the data. Let me double-check. Maybe \"gares\" is a contraction or variant. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"gares\" refers to the Conditional form in some row. Looking at the Conditional column:\n\n- row0: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0947\u091b\u0941\n- row1: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0947\u091b\u094c\u0902\n- row2: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0947\u091b\n- row3: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0947\u091b\u0949\n- row4: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0947\u091b\u0941\n- row5: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0947\u091b\n- row6: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0947\u091b\u0928\u094d\n\nNo \"gares\" there either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to refer to a different form. Maybe in the table, \"gare\" is the imperative for third person singular (row5), and that's close but not \"gares\".\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided data, the claim doesn't hold because:\n\n1. \"gares\" isn't listed as an Imperative form in any row.\n2. \"gari\" isn't listed as a Past Habitual form; instead, longer forms like \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u090f\u0915\u094b\" are used.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"gares\" is the imperative meaning 'may you do' and \"gari\" is the past habitual meaning 'you did'. However, based on the table:\n\n1. **Imperative Form**: The word \"gares\" does not appear in any of the Imperative cells. For example:\n   - Second person singular (row_index=2): \u0917\u0930\n   - Third person singular (row_index=5): \u0917\u0930\u0947\n\n2. **Past Habitual Form**: The word \"gari\" is also not listed as a Past Habitual form. Instead, forms like \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u090f\u0915\u094b\" are used in the Past Habitual column.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe claim is FALSE.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo 'he did' be the past habitual and \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b garcha 'he does' be the probable future.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is referring to. It mentions two forms of the verb: \"garyo\" and \"garcha.\" The first one is said to mean 'he did' as a past habitual, and the second means 'he does' as a probable future.\n\nI should look into the table provided to see where these terms appear and what their actual meanings are according to the table. Let me go through each row in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there's a \"row_index\" which starts from 0 upwards, and each row has multiple columns like \"row_0\", \"row_1\", etc., with different forms of the verb \"gar-\".\n\nStarting with \"garyo.\" The claim says it means 'he did' as a past habitual. I'll search through the rows to find where \"garyo\" is mentioned.\n\nLooking at row index 6, which seems to be about third person singular low-grade: it has \"garyo\" in column_3 (which is the past tense). The translation there is 'he did.' So that matches part of the claim. But does the table specify whether this is a past habitual?\n\nWait, looking at the row descriptions:\n\n- Row 0: first person singular present\n- Row 1: first person plural present\n- Row 2: second person singular present\n- Row 3: second person plural present\n- Row 4: third person singular low-grade (which is where \"garyo\" is)\n- Row 5: third person middle-grade/plural masculine\n\nIn row 4, the form is \"garyo,\" which is under column_3. The translations for row 4 are:\n\nColumn 0: garcha 'he does' - present\nColumn 1: garl\u0101 'he will probably do'\nColumn 2: garyo 'he did' (past)\nColumn 3: garthyo 'he used to do' (past habitual)\nColumn 4: garos 'may he do'\n\nWait, so \"garyo\" is in column_2 of row 4. The translation there is 'he did,' which is the past tense, but not necessarily a past habitual.\n\nIn the same row, column_3 has \"garthyo,\" which is translated as 'he used to do' \u2013 that's the past habitual. So \"garyo\" is just the simple past, while \"garthyo\" is the past habitual.\n\nThe claim says \"garyo\" is the past habitual, but according to the table, it's not; instead, \"garthyo\" is. Therefore, this part of the claim seems incorrect.\n\nNext, looking at \"garcha,\" which the claim says means 'he does' as a probable future. Let me find where \"garcha\" is in the table.\n\nIn row 0 (first person singular present), column_0: \"garchu\" 'I do.' Row 1 (first person plural present) has \"garchha.\" But looking at row 4, column_0 is \"garcha,\" which is third person singular low-grade. The translation there is 'he does,' so that's the present tense.\n\nThe claim says it's a probable future, but according to the table, \"garcha\" is the present tense, not the future. For the probable future, in row 4, column_1 is \"garl\u0101,\" which translates to 'he will probably do.'\n\nSo the claim incorrectly assigns \"garcha\" as a probable future when it's actually the present tense.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect based on the table provided. The relevant cells that contradict the claim are:\n\n- For \"garyo\": row 4, column_2 (translation 'he did')\n- For \"garcha\": row 4, column_0 (translation 'he does')\n\nAdditionally, the past habitual is in row 4, column_3 (\"garthyo\"), which wasn't mentioned in the claim.\n\nSo putting it all together, since both parts of the claim don't align with the table data, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"row_0\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"row_2\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table of Nepali verbs in different forms and tenses, along with a specific claim about two verb forms: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo\" as the injunctive and \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u094b garyo\" as the past habitual. I need to verify if this claim is true based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each term means in the context of Nepali grammar. The injunctive mood is used for giving commands or advice, while the past habitual refers to actions that were regularly performed in the past. So, my task is to check if \"garthyo\" serves as an injunctive and \"garyo\" as a past habitual.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents different grammatical categories (like person, number, and tense), and the columns list specific forms and their meanings. The relevant information for this claim would likely be found under the columns that specify the verb form and its meaning.\n\nI'll go through each row to find where \"garthyo\" and \"garyo\" appear. \n\nStarting from the top:\n- Row 0: Present tense, but not related.\n- Rows 1 to 5: Different conjugations for present continuous, etc., still not relevant.\n- Row 6: This seems to be about third person singular, middle grade. Here, I find \"garthyo\" listed under the past habitual column. So, according to this, \"garthyo\" is used for actions that were regularly done in the past, which aligns with the claim.\n  \nWait, but the user's claim says \"garthyo\" is the injunctive and \"garyo\" as past habitual. However, in row 6, \"garthyo\" is under past habitual, while \"garyo\" is listed earlier.\n\nLooking back:\n- Row 3: Under third person singular low-grade, I see \"garyo\" with the meaning 'he did'. This fits the past habitual use.\n  \nBut wait, where is \"garthyo\" in relation to the injunctive? The claim says it's the injunctive. Let me check if any row has \"garthyo\" as an injunctive.\n\nGoing through each row again:\n- Row 0: Doesn't have these forms.\n- Row 1: Present continuous, not relevant.\n- Row 2: Future tense, no match.\n- Row 3: Third person singular low-grade. Here, \"garyo\" is past habitual, but no injunctive here.\n  \nWait, perhaps the injunctive is in a different row. Let me look for rows that mention injunctive.\n\nLooking at the headers, I see columns like 'present', 'future', 'past', 'injunctive', and 'optative'. So, under the 'injunctive' column, what's listed?\n\nRow 0: injunctive is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d gar\" meaning 'do'.\nRow 1: injunctive is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0941\u0901\u091b\u094c\u0902 gareuNchauM\" which seems more like a future tense.\nRow 2: injunctive is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0948\u091b\u094c\u0902 garDaiChauM\", also future continuous.\nRow 3: injunctive is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0936\u094d\u092f\u094c\u0902 garishyauM\" again future.\nWait, this doesn't seem right. Maybe the injunctive forms are in a different part of the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. The claim specifically mentions \"garthyo\" as injunctive and \"garyo\" as past habitual. In row 3, \"garyo\" is under 'past' column with meaning 'he did', which matches past habitual. However, where is \"garthyo\"? Looking back:\n\nRow 6: third person singular middle-grade, I see \"garthyo\" under the 'past' column as well, but in row 3 it's \"garyo\". So perhaps there's a confusion here.\n\nWait, maybe the user made an error. According to the table, \"garyo\" is past habitual (row 3), and \"garthyo\" is also in the past column but under a different row (row 6). The claim says \"garthyo\" is injunctive, but according to the table, it's still in the past tense. \n\nTherefore, the claim that \"garthyo\" is the injunctive seems incorrect because in the table, \"garthyo\" is listed under the past column as 'he used to do', not as an injunctive form. The injunctive forms in row 0 are different.\n\nSo, the claim isn't fully supported by the table. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"is_claim_supported\": false,\n  \"reasoning\": \"The claim that 'garthyo' is an injunctive and 'garyo' is a past habitual cannot be fully supported based on the provided table.

Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the claim is about a relationship between two Nepali verbs: \u0917\u0930\u093fs (gari) and \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d (garchas). The claim states that gari is the past habitual form of garchas. \n\nLooking at the table provided in the data, I see it's structured with rows representing different grammatical persons and tenses, and columns indicating various aspects like Present Continuous, Past Continuous, etc.\n\nI need to find where these two verbs appear in the table. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting with row 0: \"First person singular low-grade\". It has garchu for the present continuous. Not relevant here.\n\nRow 1 is first person plural low-grade, again garcha and garchu, but not our verbs.\n\nRow 2: First person plural middle-grade, garcham. Still not matching.\n\nRow 3: Second person singular low-grade. Here, under Present Continuous is garchas (you will do). That's one of the verbs in the claim.\n\nLooking at the same row for past forms: Past Continuous is garis (gari), which matches the other verb in the claim. So, this seems relevant because it shows that gari is indeed linked to garchas as a past form.\n\nRow 4: Second person singular high-grade. Doesn't seem relevant here since we're dealing with low-grade forms.\n\nRow 5: Third person singular low-grade. Here, the present continuous is garcha and past is garis (gari). So again, gari appears under the Past Continuous column for third person singular.\n\nRow 6: Third person plural middle-grade, but the verbs here don't match our claim.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are in row 3, where we have both garchas and garis. Additionally, row 5 also shows gari as a past form of garcha, which is similar to the claim's relationship.\n\nWait, but in row 5, the present continuous is garcha (third person singular), and the past is garis (gari). So that supports the idea that gari is the past form of garchas.\n\nSo both rows 3 and 5 show the connection between garchas/garcha and gari in their respective persons. Therefore, this supports the claim that gari is the past habitual of garchas.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table where gari appears as the past form of garchas.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Past Continuous\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Past Continuous\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It says that the imperative of the past habitual form \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\" ('you did') becomes \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\" ('may you do'). \n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to find where these forms appear. Let me go through each row and see if either of these verbs are listed.\n\nRow 0: It lists \"Imperative\" as one of the categories but doesn't have any specific verb forms here.\nRow 1: This is about the singular imperative for different pronouns, but I don't see \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\" or \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\" here.\nRow 2: Singular aorist, again no match.\nRow 3: Plural aorist, still not seeing these forms.\nRow 4: Singular past habitual. Here, under 'Imperative', there's \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\" (gari) which matches the first part of the claim.\nRow 5: Plural past habitual doesn't have either form.\nRow 6: Third person singular low-grade. Under 'Imperative', I see \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\" (gare), but not \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\".\nWait, looking again at row 6, under 'Imperative' it's \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\", which is different from \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\". So that doesn't match.\nRow 7: Third person middle-grade/plural masculine. Under 'Imperative', there's \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0915\u094b\" (gareko) which is also not matching.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let me check each row again for the specific forms.\n\nLooking back at the claim: The past habitual form is \u0917\u0930\u093f ('you did'), and its imperative is supposed to be \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d ('may you do').\n\nIn row 4 (third row in the table, index 3?), under 'Imperative' it's \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\" gari-s. So that might correspond to \"gari\" as mentioned. Then, looking for \"gares\", which is the imperative form.\n\nLooking through all rows again:\n\nIn row 4 (third person singular low-grade), under 'Imperative' it's \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\" (gare). The claim says it should be \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\" gares. So that doesn't match exactly. \n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong part. The claim is about the imperative of the past habitual, so perhaps the relevant cells are in rows where both forms appear.\n\nIn row 4: 'Imperative' is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\" (gari-s), which might be the past habitual form for second person plural? Or maybe singular.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The claim says \"the imperative of the past habitual \u0917\u0930\u093f gari 'you did' be \u0917\u0930\u0947s gares 'may you do'\". So the past habitual is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\" and its imperative should change to \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s\".\n\nLooking back at row 4, under 'Imperative', it's \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\", which ends with -is. That might be the past habitual form. Then, looking for where the imperative would change to \"gares\". \n\nWait, in row 6 (third person singular low-grade), under 'Imperative' is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\" gare. Not gares. So perhaps that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding how imperatives are formed from past habituals. The claim suggests a specific transformation: from \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\" to \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\". \n\nLooking through the table:\n\nIn row 4 (third person singular low-grade), under 'Imperative' it's \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\", which is gari-s. So perhaps that's where the past habitual form appears.\n\nThen, looking for the imperative form as per the claim: \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s\" (gares). I don't see this exact form in the table. The closest is in row 6, but it's just \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\".\n\nSo the claim says that \"gari\" (from past habitual) becomes \"gares\" in imperative. But according to the table, the imperative for past habitual is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\", not \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\". So there might be a discrepancy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong row. Let me check each row where 'Imperative' appears:\n\n- Row 4: \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\"\n- Row 6: \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\"\n- Other rows don't seem to have these forms.\n\nThe claim's target imperative is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\", which isn't present in the table. Therefore, it seems that according to the provided data, this transformation doesn't occur as stated. \n\nSo, based on the table, the imperative of the past habitual form \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\" (gari) would be \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\" (gari-s), not \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\". Therefore, the claim is incorrect as per the given data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the imperative of the past habitual form \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\" ('you did') becomes \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\" ('may you do'). However, according to the table:\n\n- In row 4 (third person singular low-grade), under 'Imperative', it's listed as \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\" (gari-s).\n- The form \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\" is not found in any row.\n\nTherefore, the transformation described in the claim does not match the data provided. \n\n**Answer:** According to the table, the imperative of the past habitual \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\" is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\", not \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\". Therefore, the claim is incorrect based on the given information.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{False}}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"garyo garyo 'he do , ' be the past habitual of garcha garcha 'he does'\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part means. The claim is about a verb form in Nepali. \"garyo\" is supposed to be the past habitual form of \"garcha\", which is present tense for \"he does\".\n\nLooking at the table structure provided, it's divided into different rows, each representing a different grammatical person and grade (like singular, plural, low-grade, middle-grade, etc.). Each row has several columns: 1st column is the person/grade, then the forms for Present Continuous, Future Probable, Past Simple, Past Habitual, and Imperative.\n\nSo to verify the claim, I need to check two things:\n1. What's the present continuous form of \"garcha\"?\n2. What's the past habitual form corresponding to that?\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nIn row 6 (third person singular low-grade), the Present Continuous is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b garcha 'he does'\". The Past Simple is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo 'he did'\", and the Past Habitual is also \"garyo\".\n\nWait, but in row 6, column \"Past Habitual\" is same as \"Past Simple\"? That might be a problem because if both are \"garyo\", then the claim that \"garyo\" is the past habitual of \"garcha\" could be correct. But I'm not sure.\n\nHowever, let's check other rows to see consistency. For example, in row 7 (third person middle-grade/plural masculine), the Present Continuous is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0928 garchan 'they do'\", Past Simple is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947 gare 'they did'\", and Past Habitual is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947 garthe 'they used to do'\". Wait, that seems off. Maybe a typo in the data.\n\nBut focusing back on row 6: \"garyo\" is both Past Simple and Past Habitual for third person singular low-grade. So if the claim says that \"garyo\" is the past habitual of \"garcha\", which is present continuous, then according to this table, it's correct because in the same row, under Past Habitual, it's \"garyo\".\n\nWait, but sometimes languages have different forms for past simple and past habitual. In Nepali, I think \"garyo\" can be both. So maybe the claim is accurate here.\n\nHowever, let me check another source or example to confirm. From what I remember, in Nepali, the past habitual form often uses \"-eko\" or similar suffixes, but maybe for some verbs it's different. Alternatively, perhaps \"garyo\" serves as both past simple and past habitual in certain cases, especially in spoken language.\n\nBut according to the table provided, row 6 shows that \"garyo\" is listed under both Past Simple and Past Habitual columns. Therefore, if the claim states that \"garyo\" is the past habitual of \"garcha\", then it's supported by this data because they're in the same row, with \"garcha\" as present continuous and \"garyo\" as past habitual.\n\nSo, I think the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Present Continuous\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Past Habitual\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo 'he used to do' be the injunctive of \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo 'he did'\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what an injunctive is in Nepali grammar. From what I remember, the injunctive mood is used for giving orders or advice, similar to how we use \"let\" or \"may\" in English. So, if garthyo is the injunctive form of garyo, that would mean it's used to express a request or suggestion related to the action of doing something.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find where these forms appear and check their contexts. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0: It's about the first person singular. The cells don't mention garthyo or garyo here, so probably not relevant.\n\nRow 1: First person plural. Again, no mention of those words.\n\nRow 2: Second person singular. Here I see \"garos\" which is the injunctive form for you (singular). But that's not related to the claim about he/him.\n\nRow 3: Second person plural. The forms here are for \"you all\", so again, not relevant to the third person singular.\n\nRow 4: High\u5c0a\u094d (\"High\u5c0a\") \u2013 I'm assuming this is a specific grammatical category or form in Nepali. Here, I see \"garnuhos\" which seems related but it's in the high\u5c0a category for you (singular). Not directly applicable since the claim is about third person.\n\nRow 5: Third person singular low grade. This row has \"garthyo\" under the fourth column (presumably past tense or something), and \"garos\" as injunctive. Wait, garthyo is listed here in the present tense? Or maybe it's a different aspect. The columns are: present, future, past, past participle, injunctive.\n\nWait, let me clarify the columns: In the table, each row has five cells after the first (which is the person). So column 0 might be the person, then column 1: present tense, column 2: future, column 3: past, column 4: past participle, column 5: injunctive.\n\nSo in row 6 (third person singular low-grade), under past participle is \"garthyo\", which would mean 'he used to do'. The injunctive here is \"garos\".\n\nBut the claim says that garthyo is the injunctive of garyo. Let's see where garyo appears.\n\nLooking back, in row 6 (third person singular low-grade), under past tense, it's \"garyo\" meaning 'he did'. So the past participle is \"garthyo\", and the injunctive is \"garos\".\n\nWait, so garthyo is not an injunctive form but a past participle. The injunctive is \"garos\". Therefore, the claim that garthyo is the injunctive of garyo would be incorrect because in the table, garthyo is under the past participle column for third person singular low grade, while the injunctive is listed as \"garos\".\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because garthyo isn't functioning as an injunctive here but rather as a past participle. The injunctive form for 'he' would be \"garos\", not \"garthyo\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094b\" (garthyo) is the injunctive of \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b\" (garyo). Checking the table:\n\n- \"garyo\" appears in row 6, column 3 (past tense), meaning 'he did'.\n- \"garthyo\" is in row 6, column 4 (past participle), not the injunctive.\n- The injunctive for third person singular low grade is \"garos\" in row 6, column 5.\n\nThus, the claim is incorrect because garthyo is a past participle, not an injunctive. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"past\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"past_participle\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"injunctive\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So I need to verify if gari is indeed the simple past tense form of garchas according to the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the table to find where these terms appear. \n\nStarting with \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\", which means 'you (will) do'. Looking at the rows:\n\n- The third row has \"garchas\" under 'third person singular low-grade', indicating present tense.\nWait, no\u2014the second row is for \"third person singular low-grade\". Let me check again. \n\nLooking back, the fifth row is labeled as \"third person singular low-grade\" and contains \"garcha\" which seems similar but not exactly garchas. Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting rows.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRow 0: first person plural\nRow 1: second person plural\nRow 2: second person singular low-grade\nRow 3: third person singular low-grade\nRow 4: third person middle-grade/plural masculine\nRow 5: another category? Or perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, the table has multiple rows. Let me list them:\n\n1. First row (index 0): \"garchu\" which is first person plural.\n2. Second row (index 1): \"garcha\" as second person plural low-grade.\n3. Third row (index 2): \"garchas\" under second person singular low-grade, meaning 'you (will) do'.\n4. Fourth row (index 3): third person singular low-grade with \"garcha\".\n5. Fifth row (index 4): third person middle-grade/plural masculine with \"garchan\".\n\nSo garchas is in row 2, second person singular low-grade.\n\nNow looking for the simple past form of garchas which should be 'you did'. The claim says it's \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs gari\". Let me check where gari appears.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 3 (third person singular low-grade) has \"gari\" as the third column entry, which is the simple past tense. It says \"gari 'he did'\".\n\nWait, but in this case, the subject is third person singular. The claim refers to second person singular ('you'). So does gari correspond to that?\n\nIn row 2 (second person singular low-grade), the columns are:\n\n- Column 0: garchas\n- Column 1: garl\u0101\n- Column 2: gari\n- Column 3: garthiyo\n- Column 4: garos\n\nWait, no\u2014looking at row indices correctly. Let me check each row's content.\n\nRow index 2 is \"third person singular low-grade\", but that doesn't make sense because the subject should be 'you' in this case.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the rows. Let me list all rows with their contents:\n\nRow 0: first person plural - garchu\nRow 1: second person plural - garcha\nRow 2: second person singular low-grade - garchas\nRow 3: third person singular low-grade - garcha (present), garl\u0101, gari (simple past)\nWait, row 3's columns are:\n\n- present tense: garcha 'he does'\n- will probably do: garl\u0101\n- simple past: garyo or gari?\n\nLooking at the data, in row 3, column 2 is \"garyo\" which is third person singular low-grade, but I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me look again:\n\nThe table's rows are as follows (assuming index starts at 0):\n\nRow 0: first person plural\nRow 1: second person plural\nRow 2: second person singular low-grade\nRow 3: third person singular low-grade\nRow 4: third person middle-grade/plural masculine\nRow 5: high-grade or another category\n\nIn row 2 (second person singular low-grade), the entries are:\n\n- present tense: garchas\n- will probably do: garl\u0101\n- simple past: gariyo?\nWait, looking at the data provided, for row 2 (index 2), column names are:\n\nThe columns are \"present\", \"will probably\", \"simple past\", \"used to\", \"subjunctive\".\n\nLooking at row 2's cells:\n\n\"Present\": garchas\n\"Will probably\": garl\u0101\n\"Simple past\": gariyo?\n\nWait, the data shows for row 2: \n\n[\"garchas\", \"garl\u0101\", \"gariyo\", \"garthiyo\", \"garos\"]\n\nSo simple past is \"gariyo\".\n\nBut the claim says it's \"gari\". Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in another row. Let me check other rows for \"gari\".\n\nLooking at row 3 (third person singular low-grade), column 2 is \"garyo\" which is third person singular.\n\nRow 4: third person middle-grade/plural masculine, simple past is \"garche\" or similar.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the claim refers to a different form or row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the second person singular low-grade (row 2), the simple past is \"gariyo\", not \"gari\". So the claim might be incorrect because it should end with \"yo\".\n\nTherefore, the correct simple past for garchas would be \"gariyo\" as per row 2's column 2.\n\nBut the claim states \"gari\" without \"yo\". That suggests a discrepancy. Therefore, the claim is likely incorrect based on the table provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs gari 'you did'\" is the simple past of \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas is incorrect according to the table. The correct simple past form for garchas is \"gariyo\" as found in row 2, column 3.\n\n**Answer:**  \nNo, according to the table, the simple past tense of \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d (garchas)\" is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u092f\u094b (gariyo)\", not \"\u0917\u0930\u093f (gari)\". Therefore, the claim is incorrect.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the claim is: \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares 'may you do' be the injunctive for \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did'\". I need to check if this claim holds true based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse what the claim is saying. It's stating that \"gares\" is an injunctive form of \"gari\", which means it's a command or request directed at you (singular). The words are in Nepali, and the context seems to be about verb forms in different grammatical categories.\n\nLooking at the table structure provided, each row represents different grammatical persons and numbers, along with various tenses. Each cell under these rows contains verb forms and their English translations.\n\nMy goal is to find where \"gares\" and \"gari\" appear in the table. Let me scan through each row:\n\n1. The first row is about the first person singular. It includes \"\u0917\u0930\u0942 \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0941\" which translates to \"I do\". Not relevant here.\n2. Second row is first person plural: \"\u0917\u0930\u094c\u0901\u0938\u094d...\" which isn't related.\n3. Third row: second person singular low-grade. Here, the injunctive form is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947 \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0948\" but that doesn't match \"gares\".\n4. Fourth row: second person plural. It has \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0902\u091b\u094c\u0902\", which is a present tense form.\n5. Fifth row: high-grade commands. The injunctive here is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u094b\u0938\u094d\", not matching our target.\n6. Sixth row: third person singular low-grade. It shows \"\u0917\u0930\u0947 \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0926\u091b\" as the present tense, and \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did'\" for past tense. Wait, that's interesting. The cell says \"gari\" means \"you did\".\n7. Seventh row: third person plural masculine. Here, under the injunctive column (column 5), we have \"\u0917\u0930\u0942\u0928\u094d\" which translates to \"may they do\".\n\nWait a second, I might be mixing up the columns. Let me re-examine the table's structure.\n\nEach row has several columns:\n\n- Present tense\n- Future tense\n- Past tense\n- Perfect tense\n- Injunctive\n\nSo, for each row (person/number), there are these five verb forms.\n\nLooking again at row 6: third person singular low-grade. The past tense is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f gari 'he did'\". Hmm, but the claim mentions \"gari\" as \"you did\", which might be a discrepancy because in this row, it's referring to third person.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look elsewhere. Let me check row 3 again: second person singular low-grade. The past tense is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f gari 'you did'\". Yes! That matches the claim's \"gari\" as \"you did\".\n\nNow, looking for \"gares\" in the injunctive form related to this. In row 3, under the injunctive column (column 5), it says \"\u0917\u0930\u0947 \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0948\" which translates to \"may you do\". But wait, that's not exactly \"gares\".\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again.\n\nIn row 4: second person plural low-grade. The injunctive is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0901\u091b\u094c\u0902\", which doesn't match.\n\nRow 5: high-grade commands. Injunctive is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u094b\u0938\u094d\" for second person singular, and the past tense here isn't relevant.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at row 3 again. The injunctive in that row is under column 5: it's written as \"\u0917\u0930\u0947 \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0948\" but I'm not sure if that's the exact form. Wait, maybe I need to check other rows.\n\nLooking at row 0 (first row), it's about first person singular, so irrelevant here.\n\nRow 1: first person plural\u2014also not relevant.\n\nRow 2: second person singular middle grade. The past tense is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did'\", which matches the claim. Now, looking at the injunctive form in this row (column 5), it's written as \"\u0917\u0930\u0942\u0928\u094d\" which translates to \"may you do\".\n\nWait, so in row 2, column 5: \"\u0917\u0930\u0942\u0928\u094d garun 'may you do'\". But the claim says \"gares\" is the injunctive form of \"gari\". So \"gares\" isn't appearing here.\n\nLooking at other rows:\n\nRow 3: second person singular low-grade. The past tense is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f gari 'you did'\", and the injunctive is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947 \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0948\", which doesn't seem to match \"gares\".\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that \"gares\" might be a different form or variant. Alternatively, maybe it's in another row.\n\nLooking at row 4: second person plural low-grade. The past tense is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0901\u091b\u094c\u0902\", which doesn't match \"gari\". Injunctive here is also not relevant.\n\nRow 5: high-grade commands for second person singular. The past tense isn't applicable, and the injunctive is different.\n\nRow 6: third person singular low-grade. Past tense is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f gari 'he did'\", but we're looking for second person.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rows. Let me check again:\n\n- Row 2: Second person singular middle grade. The past tense is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did'\". The injunctive in this row (column 5) is \"\u0917\u0930\u0942\u0928\u094d\" which means \"may you do\".\n\nThe claim says that \"gares\" is the injunctive form of \"gari\", but according to the table, it's \"garun\" instead. So perhaps there's a mistake in the claim or maybe I'm misinterpreting the rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"gares\" appears elsewhere. Let me check row 3 again: second person singular low-grade. The injunctive is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947 \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0948\", which translates to \"may you do\". Wait, \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\" could be a form of the verb in the injunctive. So \"gare\" or \"gares\" might be a variant.\n\nBut in the table, it's written as \"\u0917\u0930\u0947 \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0948\" which is more like a phrase, not just \"gares\". So perhaps \"gares\" isn't directly listed but could be an inflected form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm looking at the wrong row. Let me check row 7 (third person plural masculine). The past tense here is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'they did'\", and the injunctive is \"\u0917\u0930\u0942\u0928\u094d\" which again doesn't match \"gares\".\n\nWait, perhaps \"gares\" is a different grammatical form or a typo. Alternatively, maybe it's in another part of the table.\n\nLooking back at row 3: second person singular low-grade. The present tense is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947 \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0948\", future tense \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0915\u094b \u091b\u0941\", past tense \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did'\", perfect tense \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0915\u093e \u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u091b\u094c\u0902\", and injunctive \"\u0917\u0930\u0947 \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0948\".\n\nSo, in this row, the injunctive is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947 \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0948\", which could be broken down as \"gare gardi\". The main verb form here is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\" (gare), but it's part of a larger phrase. So perhaps \"gares\" isn't directly listed but is derived from this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim has an error, and it should refer to \"garun\" as the injunctive instead of \"gares\".\n\nIn summary, based on the table:\n\n- \"gari\" appears in row 2 (second person singular middle grade) past tense as \"you did\".\n- The injunctive form in that row is \"\u0917\u0930\u0942\u0928\u094d garun 'may you do'\".\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"gares\" is the injunctive of \"gari\" doesn't align with the table data. Instead, it's \"garun\".\n\nHowever, perhaps I'm missing something or misinterpreting the rows. Let me double-check:\n\n- The claim links \"gares\" to \"gari\", both under second person.\n- In row 2: \"gari\" is past tense, and injunctive is \"garun\".\n- In row 3: past tense is \"gari\", but the injunctive is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947 \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0948\".\n\nSo, perhaps in some contexts, \"gares\" could be a form of the injunctive. Alternatively, maybe it's a variant or typo.\n\nBut according to the table provided, \"gares\" isn't directly listed as an injunctive form for \"gari\". Instead, it's either \"garun\" or part of a longer phrase.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided table:\n\n- The word \"gari\" appears in row 2 (second person singular middle grade) past tense, translating to \"you did\".\n- The injunctive form in that same row is listed as \"\u0917\u0930\u0942\u0928\u094d garun\", which means \"may you do\".\n\nTherefore, according to the table data, the correct injunctive form for \"gari\" is \"garun\" rather than \"gares\". It's possible that there may be regional or contextual variations where \"gares\" could be used, but within the scope of this table, \"garun\" is the accurate form.\n\nAnswer: The injunctive form corresponding to \"gari\" in the table is \"\u0917\u0930\u0942\u0928\u094d\" (garun), not \"gares\". Therefore, the claim that \"gares\" is the injunctive form of \"gari\" does not align with the provided data.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says: \"the past habitual of \u0917\u0930\u093fs gari 'you did' be \u0917\u0930\u0947s gares 'may you do'\". Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let's break down what the claim is stating. It seems to be talking about a grammatical form in Nepali or another language using Devanagari script. The term \"past habitual\" likely refers to a verb form that indicates an action done habitually in the past. \n\nThe claim mentions two forms: \u0917\u0930\u093fs (gari) as 'you did' and then says that its past habitual form is \u0917\u0930\u0947s (gares), which translates to 'may you do'. Wait, that seems a bit confusing because 'may you do' sounds more like an imperative or a request rather than a past action. So maybe I'm misunderstanding something here.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it's structured into rows and columns with different grammatical persons (like first person, second person) and different tenses or aspects (like present, future, past). Each row seems to correspond to a specific subject pronoun and aspect combination.\n\nLet me try to map this out. The claim is about the past habitual form of \"gari\" being \"gares\". So I need to find where in the table these forms appear and see if they are correctly categorized as past habitual.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Each row starts with a grammatical category, like \"First person singular\", etc.\n- The columns seem to be labeled as 1.0, 2.0, ..., up to 5.0, but without explicit headers. I'll assume these are different tenses or aspects.\n\nLet me go through each relevant cell to see if I can find the forms mentioned in the claim.\n\nFirst, let's look for \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs\" (gari). I think this is a form in the table. Let's check row by row.\n\nRow 0: First person singular\n- Column 1: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0941 (garachu)\n- Column 2: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0926\u0948 (gari-dai)\n- Column 3: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0932\u093e (garel\u00e0)\n- Column 4: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b (garityo)\n- Column 5: \u0917\u0930\u0942 (garu)\n\nNone of these seem to be \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs\". So move on.\n\nRow 1: Second person singular\n- Column 1: \u0917\u0930\u0938\u094d (gars) - Wait, this is \"gari\" in the claim? Or maybe not. The form here is \"\u0917\u0930\u0938\u094d\" which is \"garis\", but the claim says \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs gari\". Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me check again.\n\nRow 1: Second person singular\n- Column 1: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d (gari) - Oh, yes! Here in row 1, column 1 is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\" which the claim refers to as \"gari\". So that's our starting point. The translation given for this cell is 'you do'.\n\nNow, the past habitual form of this would be... let's see what the claim says: it should be \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\" meaning 'may you do'. But wait, in the table, I need to find where \"gari\" (from row 1 column 1) transitions into its past habitual form.\n\nLooking at row 1, which is second person singular:\n\n- Column 2: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0926\u0948 (gari-dai) - present progressive? Maybe 'you are doing'\n- Column 3: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0932\u093e (gari-l\u00e0) - past tense? Maybe 'you did'\n- Column 4: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b (garityo) - past perfect or something else?\n- Column 5: \u0917\u0930\u0942 (garu) - future? 'you will do'\n\nWait, the claim says \"the past habitual of \u0917\u0930\u093fs gari 'you did' be \u0917\u0930\u0947s gares 'may you do'\". But in row 1, column 3 is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0932\u093e\" which would correspond to 'you did', not 'past habitual'.

The form in the claim is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\", which would be \"gares\". Let me check if there's a typo or perhaps it's in a different part.\n\nWait, maybe it's in row 7, column 3: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0932\u0947 (gari-le). That's \"you did\" in plural. But the claim is about singular.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 1 again:\n\nRow 1: Second person singular\n- Column 1: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d (gari) - 'you do'\n- Column 2: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0926\u0948 (gari-dai)\n- Column 3: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0932\u093e (gari-l\u00e0) - past tense 'you did'\n- Column 4: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b (garityo)\n- Column 5: \u0917\u0930\u0942 (garu)\n\nSo according to this, the past tense of \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs\" is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0932\u093e\" which translates to 'you did', as per the table. But the claim says that the past habitual form is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\", meaning 'may you do'. That doesn't align because 'may you do' seems like a different aspect, perhaps imperative or optative.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the tenses. Let me clarify: in some languages, the past habitual is used to denote actions that were regularly performed in the past. So if \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs\" is the present tense ('you do'), then the past habitual would be a form indicating 'you used to do' or 'you would do'.\n\nLooking at row 1:\n\n- Column 3: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0932\u093e (gari-l\u00e0) - this seems like a simple past tense.\n\nColumn 4: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b (garityo) - perhaps past participle or another form.\n\nBut I don't see a specific past habitual form in the table. Maybe it's using a different construction, such as with '' or other particles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s\" is not present in this table, meaning that the claim might be incorrect, or maybe it's from a different dialect or conjugation pattern.\n\nGiven that, I think there might be an error in the claim because based on the provided conjugation table for \"\u0930\u094d\u0928\", the past tense of \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs\" is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0932\u093e\", not \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s\". Therefore, the correct form should be \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0932\u093e\", translating to 'you did' or 'you were doing'.\n\nSo, to answer the question: the claim that the past habitual of \"\u0930\u094d\u0928\" (to do) is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\" meaning 'may you do' might be incorrect. The correct form from the table is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0932\u093e\", which translates to 'you did'.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the past habitual form of \"\u0930\u094d\u0928\" (to do) is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\" meaning 'may you do' appears to be incorrect based on the provided conjugation table. The correct past tense form for the singular second person is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0932\u093e,\" which translates to 'you did.'\n\n**Answer:** The past habitual form of \"\u0930\u094d\u0928\" (to do) as per the given conjugation table is not \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares.\" Instead, the past tense form for \"you\" is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0932\u093e,\" meaning 'you did.'",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table with various verb forms in Nepali and their corresponding English translations. They made a claim about the probable future of \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d\" (garchas) being \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\" (gari). My task is to verify if this claim holds true based on the information given in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. The claim states that the probable future of \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d\" which means 'you (will) do', becomes \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u094d\" meaning 'you did'. So essentially, they're suggesting that \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d\" transforms into \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\" when indicating a probable future.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I should identify where these forms appear. The relevant section would be under the verb form and its translations. Let me scan through each row to find both terms.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- Row 0: Personal pronouns, not relevant here.\n- Row 1: First person singular and plural forms; doesn't include \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d\" or \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u094d\".\n- Row 2: Second person singular. The form is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c\u0902\" which translates to 'I do', but the claim refers to 'you (will) do' so this isn't it.\n- Row 3: Third person singular. It shows \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0926\u091b\" as present and \"\u0930\u0947\u0915\u094b\" as past, which doesn't match our target forms.\n- Row 4: Second person plural. Here we see \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u094c\u0902\" translating to 'we do', again not matching the claim's subject.\n- Row 5: Third person plural. It shows \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0926\u091b\u0928\u094d\" as present and \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0915\u093e\" as past, still not our target.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I need to look at other rows beyond what's initially visible. Let me check all the provided rows carefully.\n\nUpon closer inspection, under row 5 (third person singular low-grade), we have:\n\n- Form: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d\" (garchas)\n- Translation: 'you (will) do'\n\nAnd in the same row, under the probable future column (column name is 'Probable Future'), it's listed as \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u094d\" (gari), translating to 'you did'.\n\nSo the claim exactly matches what's stated in this row. The verb form transitions from the present/future tense to a past tense when indicating a probable future, which aligns with the claim.\n\nTherefore, based on the table, the claim is fully supported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 5,\n       \"column_name\": \"Probable Future\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says: \"the phrase \u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0932\u093e gar\u0169l\u0101 'i will (probably) do' in simple past be \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garnuhunthyo 'you used to do' in the injunctive\".\n\nFirst, I need to understand each part of the claim. It mentions two phrases and their respective tenses or forms: \"gar\u0169l\u0101\" as present future with probability, and \"garnuhunthyo\" as simple past in the injunctive mood.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured into rows where each row corresponds to a different person/number combination along with various verb forms. The columns are labeled as:\n\n- Person\n- 1st person singular\n- 2nd person singular\n- 3rd person singular\n- 1st person plural\n- 2nd person plural\n- 3rd person plural\n\nEach row contains different conjugations of the verb \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b\" which translates to 'used to do'.\n\nNow, let's break down the claim:\n\n1. **Phrase gar\u0169l\u0101 (I will probably do)**: This seems like a future tense with probability. I need to check if this form exists in the table.\n\n2. **Phrase garnuhunthyo (you used to do)**: The claim states that this is in the simple past in the injunctive mood. Injunctive often relates to commands or prohibitions, but sometimes it can refer to hypotheticals or conditionals. However, looking at the table, the verb forms are all in the 'used to do' sense, which is more of a past habitual form.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Row 3 (2nd person plural): The column for 'you used to do' shows \"\u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0925\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0909\u0928\u0947\u091b\u094c\u0902 gar\u0169thyaunecchau\u1e41\". This seems like a different conjugation, not matching garnuhunthyo.\n\n- Row 5 (highly\u5c0a\u8d35\u7684 third person singular low-grade): The form is \"\u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0932\u093e gar\u0169l\u0101\" which the claim says means 'I will probably do'. However, in this row, it's under the third person singular low-grade, and the form is for 'he does' as per the table. So, there seems to be a mismatch here.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong rows. Let me check all rows where the forms match.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Row 3 (2nd person plural) shows \"\u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0932\u093e gar\u0169l\u0101\" under 'you used to do'. But the claim says this is for 'I will probably do', which would typically be first person singular. So, perhaps that's incorrect.\n\n- The form garnuhunthyo appears in row 4 (highly\u5c0a\u8d35\u7684 third person plural) as \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garnuhunthyo\" under 'they used to do'. This is for the third person plural, not second person singular or plural. So, if the claim says it's 'you used to do', that might be incorrect because in the table, this form is for 'they'.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim don't align with what's presented in the table. The phrase gar\u0169l\u0101 isn't correctly mapped to 'I will probably do' as per its placement in row 5, and garnuhunthyo isn't correctly assigned to 'you used to do' but rather to 'they used to do'.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim doesn't hold true according to the table provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2nd person singular\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"3rd person singular low-grade\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the phrase \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c\u0901 garcha\u0169 'we (will) do' in the probable future be \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo 'he used to do' in the imperative.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is referring to. The claim seems to be connecting two phrases: one from the probable future tense and another from the imperative mood. Let me break it down.\n\nThe first phrase mentioned is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c\u0901 garcha\u0169\" which is translated as 'we (will) do' in the probable future. I should check where this appears in the table. Looking through the rows, I notice that each row starts with a different grammatical category or person.\n\nI'll go through each row to find \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c\u0901 garcha\u0169\". Scanning row by row:\n\n- Row 0: It's about first person singular present tense. The phrase here is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0941 garchu\" meaning 'I am doing'.\n- Row 1: First person plural present, \"\u0930\u093f\u090f\u0901 gari\u0113\u1e41\" which means 'we are doing'.\n- Row 2: This is the probable future. Looking at row index 2, under the probable future column (which I think is the second column, but let me confirm). The phrase here is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c\u0901 garcha\u0169\", exactly what's mentioned in the claim. So this is relevant.\n- Row 3: This seems to be a different tense or mood. Let me check the rest for \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo\".\n\nThe second part of the claim refers to \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo\" as 'he used to do' in the imperative. Wait, but the imperative usually indicates a command or request, not past tense. So this seems confusing.\n\nLooking through the rows for \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo\":\n\n- Row 4: High future? The phrases here are more complex.\n- Row 5: Third person singular low-grade. The phrase is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo\", which is listed under 'he used to do'. But the row says it's in the past tense, not imperative.\n\nWait, let me check each row properly. Each row has different categories:\n\n- Row 0: First person singular present\n- Row 1: First person plural present\n- Row 2: Probable future (we will)\n- Row 3: Imperative? Let's see: The phrase is \"\u0917\u0930\u0942\u0901 ga r\u016b\u1e41\", which means 'do!'.\n- Wait, no. Looking at row index 4, it's the high future or something else.\nWait, perhaps I need to look more carefully.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 2 (row_index=2) has in probable future: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c\u0901 garcha\u0169\" meaning 'we (will) do'. That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNow, for the second part: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo\" as 'he used to do' in imperative. Hmm, looking at row 5 (row_index=5), it's third person singular low-grade with \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo\" meaning 'he did', past tense.\n\nBut the claim says it's in the imperative mood. Looking for imperative forms:\n\nRow index=3: The phrase is \"\u0917\u0930\u0942\u0901 ga r\u016b\u1e41\", which is an imperative form meaning 'do!'.\n\nSo, the second part of the claim mentions \"garthyo\" as imperative, but according to the table, it's in the past tense under third person singular low-grade. Therefore, the claim seems incorrect because \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo\" isn't an imperative form; instead, \"\u0917\u0930\u0942\u0901 ga r\u016b\u1e41\" is.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the row. Let me check again:\n\nRow index=5: third person singular low-grade has \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo\" meaning 'he did' in past tense. So it's not imperative. The imperative form is in row 3 with \"\u0917\u0930\u0942\u0901\".\n\nSo, the claim incorrectly states that \"garthyo\" is an imperative form when it's actually past tense. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the table.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"in the probable future be \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo 'he use to do' in the imperative\". So, they are connecting two things: garcha\u0169 (probable future) and garthyo (imperative). But from the table, garthyo isn't imperative; it's past tense. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo, the relevant parts are row 2 for \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c\u0901 garcha\u0169\" and no matching for \"garthyo\" as imperative. Thus, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because while \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c\u0901 garcha\u0169\" correctly refers to the probable future tense ('we will do'), \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo\" is a past tense form ('he did') and not an imperative. Therefore, the connection made in the claim does not align with the table.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the claim and the table step by step to determine if it's TRUE or FALSE.\n\nThe claim is: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas  'you (will) do' be the simple past for \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares 'may you do'\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The user is suggesting that \"garchas\" serves as the simple past tense form of \"gares.\" So, let's check both forms in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\nThe table has rows for different pronouns and tenses. Each row includes several columns: the verb form and its meaning. Let's go through each relevant part.\n\nStarting with \"garchas\" (\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d):\n- I'll search each row to find this verb form.\n- Scanning through the rows, in Row 3 under the column 'you (will) do', it says \"garchas\". The other columns show that it's the future tense for the pronoun 'you'.\n\nNext, looking at \"gares\" (\u0917\u0930\u0947):\n- I'll check each row to find this form.\n- In Row 6, under the third column which is labeled 'may he do', but wait, that's not correct. Wait, no, actually in Row 5, it's for 'third person singular low-grade' where \"gares\" appears as a future tense? Or perhaps I'm misreading.\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 3: The first column is 'you (will) do', and the verb form is \"garchas\".\n- Row 5: It's under 'third person singular low-grade' where \"gares\" appears in the fifth column, which says 'may he do'.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine each row more carefully.\n\nRow indices start at 0:\n\n1. Row 0: First Person Singular\n2. Row 1: Second Person Singular (Low Grade)\n3. Row 2: Second Person Singular (Middle Grade) / Plural?\n4. Row 3: Second Person Singular (High Grade)\n5. Row 4: High Grade for 'you'\n6. Row 5: Third Person Singular Low Grade\n7. Row 6: Third Person Singular Middle Grade / Plural\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe rows are as follows:\n\n0: First person singular (I)\n1: Second person singular low-grade (you)\n2: Second person plural or middle grade?\n3: High grade for second person\n4: High grade with 'please do'?\n5: Third person singular low-grade (he)\n6: Third person plural/masculine\n\nWait, perhaps I need to list them:\n\n- Row 0: First Person Singular\n  - Column names: \"I will do\", \"I will probably do\", etc.\n  \n- Row 1: Second Person Singular Low Grade\n  - You (will) do: garcha\n  - You will probably do: garl\u0101\n  - You did: garyo\n  - You used to do:garthyo\n  - May you do: garos\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck the actual data:\n\nLooking at the structure of each row, it's a list where each cell has a form and its meaning.\n\nFor example, Row 1 (index 1) is for \"Second Person Singular Low Grade\". The verb forms are:\n- you (will) do: garcha\n- you will probably do: garl\u0101\n- you did: garyo\n- you used to do:garthyo\n- may you do: garos\n\nSimilarly, Row 3 is for \"Second Person Singular High Grade\":\n- you (will) do: garchas\n- you will probably do: garnuhola\n- you did: garnubhayo\n- you used to do:garnuhunthyo\n- may you do: garnuhos\n\nRow 5 is Third Person Singular Low Grade:\n- he does: garcha\n- he will probably do: garl\u0101\n- he did: garyo\n- he used to do:garthyo\n- may he do: garos\n\nWait, but the claim mentions \"garchas\" as a form for 'you (will) do' and \"gares\" as 'may you do'. So let's see where \"gares\" is.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0:\n- I will do: garu\n- I will probably do: garl\u012b\n- I did: gaiyo\n- I used to do: garth\u012b\n- May I do: gar\u016b\n\nRow 1:\n- you (will) do: garcha\n- you will probably do: garl\u0101\n- you did: garyo\n- you used to do:garthyo\n- may you do: garos\n\nRow 2:\n- you (plural) (will) do: garchau\n- you will probably do: garl\u012bu\n- you did: gaiyu\n- you used to do:gair\u016b\n- may you do: gar\u016b\n\nRow3:\n- you (high grade): garchas\n- garnuhola\n- garnubhayo\n- garnuhunthyo\n- garnuhos\n\nRow4:\n- Third person plural low-grade? Or maybe another category.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing \"gares\". Let me search through all the rows:\n\nLooking at each row's cells for the verb form:\n\nRow 0: garu, garl\u012b, gaiyo, garth\u012b, gar\u016b\n\nRow1: garcha, garl\u0101, garyo, garthyo, garos\n\nRow2: garchau, garl\u012bu, gaiyu, gair\u016b, gar\u016b\n\nRow3: garchas, garnuhola, garnubhayo, garnuhunthyo, garnuhos\n\nRow4: Not sure as the user hasn't provided all rows.\n\nWait, in Row5:\n\n- Third Person Singular Low Grade:\n  - he does: garcha\n  - he will probably do: garl\u0101\n  - he did: garyo\n  - he used to do:garthyo\n  - may he do: garos\n\nRow6:\n- Third Person Singular Middle Grade / Plural:\n  - they do: garchaun\n  - they will probably do: garl\u012bu\n  - they did: gaiyu\n  - they used to do:gair\u016b\n  - may they do:gar\u016b\n\nWait, I'm not seeing \"gares\" anywhere in the rows. The claim says that \"garchas\" is the simple past of \"gares\". But from the table, \"garchas\" is under Row3 (Second Person Singular High Grade) as 'you (will) do', which is future tense.\n\nThe form \"gares\" isn't present in any row. The closest forms are \"garos\" in Row1 and \"gar\u016b\" in other rows, but not \"gares\".\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"garchas\" is the simple past of \"gares\" seems incorrect because:\n\n1. \"garchas\" is a future tense form for 'you'.\n2. \"gares\" doesn't appear in any row; perhaps it's a typo or misunderstanding.\n3. The table shows different forms, but none indicate that \"garchas\" is the past of \"gares\".\n\nHence, the claim is FALSE because \"garchas\" isn't the simple past of \"gares\", and \"gares\" itself doesn't exist in the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is **FALSE**.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Claim:** The claim states that \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d (garchas)\" is the simple past tense of \"\u0917\u0930\u0947 (gares)\" for 'you'.\n\n2. **Analyze the Table:**\n   - Look for \"garchas\": Found in Row3, under 'Second Person Singular High Grade', meaning 'you (will) do' \u2014 future tense.\n   - Search for \"gares\": Not found in any row. The closest forms are \"garos\" and \"gar\u016b\", but not \"gares\".\n\n3. **Determine Tenses:**\n   - \"garchas\" is a future tense form, not past.\n   - Since \"gares\" isn't present, the claim lacks support.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** The claim incorrectly identifies the tense of \"garchas\" and references a non-existent form (\"gares\").\n\n**Answer:** The claim is FALSE because \"garchas\" is a future tense form, not the past, and \"gares\" doesn't exist in the provided data.",
