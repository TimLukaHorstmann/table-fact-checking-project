    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"wozniak have compete in canada 5 time and win every time\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"wozniak.\" Looking at the data, it seems like Wozniak might be referring to a tennis player, maybe someone who has participated in several tournaments listed here. I don't see any direct mention of \"Wozniak\" in the table, but perhaps it's an error or a misspelling. Maybe they meant another player whose name is similar or perhaps it's a different person entirely.\n\nNext, the claim says that this person competed in Canada five times and won every time. So I need to check how many times the player competed in Canada and whether all those instances were wins.\n\nLooking at the table, let me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Outcome is \"winner\", date June 30, 2002, tournament Lachine, Canada. Surface hard, opponent Beier Ko, score 6-0, 6-3.\n2. Row 1: Winner, July 17, 2005, Hamilton, Canada. Clay surface, opponent Mariana Jose Argeri, score 6-1, 6-2.\n3. Row 2: Runner-up, October 2, 2005, Pelham, United States. So not in Canada.\n4. Row 3: Winner, October 16, 2005, Victoria, Mexico. Not in Canada.\n5. Row 4: Runner-up, October 23, 2005, Mexico City, Mexico. Again, not Canada.\n6. Row 5: Winner, November 13, 2005, Toronto, Canada. Hard court (I). Opponent Olena Antypina, score 6-4, 6-3.\n7. Row 6: Winner, July 23, 2006, Hamilton, Canada. Clay surface, opponent Val\u00e9rie T\u00e9treault, score 6-1, 6-7 (5-7), 6-2.\n8. Row 7: Winner, October 1, 2006, Ashland, United States. Not Canada.\n9. Row 8: Winner, November 12, 2006, Pittsburgh, USA. No.\n10. Row 9: Runner-up, March 23, 2008, Redding, USA. No.\n11. Row 10: Winner, August 7, 2011, Vancouver, Canada. Hard court, opponent Jamie Hampton, score 6-3, 6-1.\n12. Row 11: Winner, March 17, 2012, Nassau, Bahamas. Not Canada.\n\nSo in the table, the tournaments in Canada are rows 0, 1, 5, 6, and 10. That's five instances where the tournament location is in Canada. Now, checking the outcomes for these rows:\n\n- Row 0: Winner\n- Row 1: Winner\n- Row 5: Winner\n- Row 6: Winner\n- Row 10: Winner\n\nSo all five times the player competed in Canada, they were winners. Therefore, if \"wozniak\" is referring to this player (maybe a typo for someone else), then the claim would be TRUE.\n\nWait, but I don't see any name matching Wozniak here. The opponents are listed, but maybe the player's name isn't present in the table. Perhaps it's inferred that all these wins are by the same player? Or is there more context needed?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"wozniak\" refers to someone else not listed here. Without seeing the player's name in the data, I'm making an assumption based on the outcome being a win each time in Canada.\n\nBut since the table doesn't explicitly mention Wozniak as the player, maybe it's another person. However, assuming that all these entries are about Wozniak, then yes, he competed five times in Canada and won every time.\n\nSo I think the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"wozniak compete in 5 tournament in 2005 and win 3 of them\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim into two parts:\n1. Wozniak competed in 5 tournaments in 2005.\n2. She won 3 of those tournaments.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match that Wozniak played. The columns include outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, and score.\n\nI should go through each row to check if it's from 2005 and whether Wozniak was the winner or runner-up.\n\nLet me list out all rows where the date is in 2005:\n- Row 1: July 17, 2005 \u2013 Outcome: Winner\n- Row 2: October 2, 2005 \u2013 Outcome: Runner-up\n- Row 3: October 16, 2005 \u2013 Outcome: Winner\n- Row 4: October 23, 2005 \u2013 Outcome: Runner-up\n- Row 5: November 13, 2005 \u2013 Outcome: Winner\n\nSo there are 5 tournaments in 2005. Now, checking the outcomes:\n- Rows 1, 3, and 5 show she was a winner.\n- Rows 2 and 4 show she was runner-up.\n\nThat means she won 3 out of 5 tournaments in 2005. \n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are correct.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"wozniak have only compete in the bahamas 1 time but win\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It's saying that Wozniak competed once in the Bahamas and won that competition. So, my task is to check two things: how many times did she compete there and was she a winner in each instance?\n\nLooking at the table, which has data about various tournaments. The relevant columns for this claim would be \"tournament\" (to find where it's in the Bahamas) and \"outcome\" (to see if she won or not). Also, I should check the \"opponent\" to confirm it's referring to Wozniak, but wait, actually, the table might represent her matches as either a winner or runner-up. So each row is about her performance against an opponent in a specific tournament.\n\nWait, looking at the data rows, I see entries like [outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, score]. Each row is a match she played. The \"outcome\" column shows whether she was the winner or runner-up in that match.\n\nSo to check how many times she competed in the Bahamas, I should look for entries where the \"tournament\" location includes \"bahamas\". Let's go through each data entry:\n\nRow 0: Lachine, Canada \u2013 not Bahamas\nRow 1: Hamilton, Canada \u2013 nope\nRow 2: Pelham, United States \u2013 no\nRow 3: Victoria, Mexico \u2013 no\nRow 4: Mexico City, Mexico \u2013 no\nRow 5: Toronto, Canada \u2013 no\nRow 6: Hamilton, Canada \u2013 again, not Bahamas\nRow 7: Ashland, United States \u2013 nope\nRow 8: Pittsburgh, United States \u2013 no\nRow 9: Redding, United States \u2013 still no\nRow 10: Vancouver, Canada \u2013 no\nRow 11: Nassau, Bahamas \u2013 yes! This is the only row where the tournament location is in the Bahamas.\n\nIn this row (row 11), her outcome was \"winner\", and she played against Alize Cornet with a score of 6-4,7-5. So she did win that match.\n\nSo according to the table, there's only one entry where she competed in the Bahamas, and she won it. That matches the claim exactly: she competed once and won.\n\nI should also make sure there are no other entries with the Bahamas. Scanning through all rows again confirms that row 11 is the only one. So yes, her only competition in the Bahamas was a win.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Wozniak only competed once in the Bahamas and won. The table shows exactly one match in Nassau, Bahamas where she was the winner.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. The name mentioned is \"wozniak,\" which I assume refers to a tennis player, possibly someone like Agnes Sz\u00e1vay-Wozniak or another player with that surname. The claim states that she won 9 times between 2002 and 2012.\n\nLooking at the table provided in JSON format, it lists various matches with columns: outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, score. Each row represents a match result. My task is to count how many times the player (presumably wozniak) had an \"outcome\" of \"winner\" between 2002 and 2012.\n\nI'll start by examining each row in the data array to see when she was the winner.\n\nLet's go through each entry:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Outcome is \"winner\", date is June 30, 2002. So that's a win.\n   - Relevant cell: Row 0, outcome column.\n\n2. **Row 1**: Outcome is \"winner\", date July 17, 2005. Another win.\n   - Relevant cell: Row 1, outcome column.\n\n3. **Row 2**: Outcome is \"runner-up\". So not a win. Skip.\n\n4. **Row 3**: Outcome \"winner\", October 16, 2005. Win count increases again.\n   - Relevant cell: Row 3, outcome column.\n\n5. **Row 4**: Outcome \"runner-up\". Not a win.\n\n6. **Row 5**: Outcome \"winner\", November 13, 2005. Another win.\n   - Relevant cell: Row 5, outcome column.\n\n7. **Row 6**: Outcome \"winner\", July 23, 2006. Win count up again.\n   - Relevant cell: Row 6, outcome column.\n\n8. **Row 7**: Outcome \"winner\", October 1, 2006. Another win.\n   - Relevant cell: Row 7, outcome column.\n\n9. **Row 8**: Outcome \"winner\", November 12, 2006. Yet another win.\n   - Relevant cell: Row 8, outcome column.\n\n10. **Row 9**: Outcome \"runner-up\". Not a win.\n\n11. **Row 10**: Outcome \"winner\", August 7, 2011. Win count increases again.\n    - Relevant cell: Row 10, outcome column.\n\n12. **Row 11**: Outcome \"winner\", March 17, 2012. Another win within the timeframe.\n    - Relevant cell: Row 11, outcome column.\n\nNow, counting the wins:\n\n- Rows 0,1,3,5,6,7,8,10,11 are all \"winner\" outcomes. That's a total of 9 wins between 2002 and 2012.\n\nWait, let me recount to make sure I didn't miss any or count incorrectly.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Row 0: Win\n- Row 1: Win\n- Row 3: Win\n- Row 5: Win\n- Row 6: Win\n- Row 7: Win\n- Row 8: Win\n- Row 10: Win\n- Row 11: Win\n\nThat's indeed 9 wins.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"wozniak have compete in canada 5 time and loss every time\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that Wozniak competed five times in Canada and lost all those matches. So, two main points: number of competitions in Canada (should be 5) and whether all resulted in losses.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it's a JSON structure with columns like outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, and score. The data rows are listed under \"data\". Each row represents a match that Wozniak played.\n\nI'll go through each row to check where the location is Canada. Let me list out all the tournaments in Canada:\n\n1. Row 0: Lachine, Canada\n2. Row 1: Hamilton, Canada\n3. Row 5: Toronto, Canada\n4. Row 6: Hamilton, Canada (but this is 2006)\nWait, looking again:\n- Row 0: June 30, 2002 - Lachine, Canada\n- Row 1: July 17, 2005 - Hamilton, Canada\n- Row 5: November 13, 2005 - Toronto, Canada\n- Row 6: July 23, 2006 - Hamilton, Canada\n- Row 8: October 1, 2006 - Ashland, United States (so not Canada)\nWait, did I miss one? Let me recount:\n\nRows:\n0: Lachine, Canada (winner)\n1: Hamilton, Canada (winner)\n5: Toronto, Canada (winner)\n6: Hamilton, Canada (winner)\nThen, looking further down, any other Canadian tournaments?\n\nRow 8 is in the United States. Row 9 is in the US as well. Then row 10 is Vancouver, Canada (winner). And row 11 is Nassau, Bahamas.\n\nWait, so I have rows 0,1,5,6,10 all in Canada. That's five times. So Wozniak competed five times in Canada. Now, the next part: did she lose every time?\n\nLooking at each of these rows:\n\n- Row 0: outcome is winner\n- Row 1: outcome is winner\n- Row 5: outcome is winner\n- Row 6: outcome is winner\n- Row 10: outcome is winner\n\nSo all five times, the outcome was \"winner\". Therefore, she didn't lose any of those matches. \n\nWait, but in row 5, the score is 6-4, 6-3. That's a win. Similarly, others have scores that indicate wins.\n\nTherefore, the claim says she lost every time, which is not true because all outcomes are \"winner\".\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states Wozniak competed five times in Canada and lost each time.

It has columns: outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, score. The data includes rows with information about matches played by a player, likely Wozniak since that's the name mentioned in the claim.\n\nThe claim has two parts:\n1.

Outcome is winner.\n\nSo, in 2006, there are three entries where the outcome is \"winner.\" But wait, that's only three tournaments in total? Let me check again because the claim says five tournaments in 2006.\n\nWait a minute, looking back at all rows, I see:\n\n- Row index 7: October 1, 2006.\n- Row index 8: November 12, 2006.\n- And another row? Let me recount. Rows 5 and 6 are from 2005, then row 7 is 2006. Then rows 8 and beyond until the last entries.\n\nWait, I might have missed some. Let me go through each row's date:\n\n1. June 30, 2002: Not relevant.\n2. July 17, 2005: No.\n3. October 2, 2005: No.\n4. October 16, 2005: No.\n5. October 23, 2005: No.\n6. November 13, 2005: No.\n7. July 23, 2006: Yes.\n8. October 1, 2006: Yes.\n9. November 12, 2006: Yes.\n10. March 23, 2008: No.\n11. August 7, 2011: No.\n12. March 17, 2012: No.\n\nSo only three entries are from 2006 (rows 7, 8, and perhaps another? Wait, rows 5-9 are 2005 except row 7 is 2006). Let me recount:\n\nRow indices:\n0: 2002\n1: 2005\n2: 2005\n3: 2005\n4: 2005\n5: 2005 (Nov 13, 2005)\n6: July 23, 2006\n7: October 1, 2006\n8: November 12, 2006\n\nSo only three entries in 2006. All of them have outcome \"winner.\" So according to this, Wozniak competed in 3 tournaments and won all 3.\n\nBut the claim says 5 tournaments and winning 3. Since there are only 3 tournaments in 2006, not 5, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Wozniak competed in five tournaments in 2006 and won three. Upon examining the data, only three tournaments were played in 2006, all of which were wins. Therefore, the claim about competing in five tournaments is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"wozniak have only compete in the bahamas 2 time but lose\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It says two things:\n1. Wozniak has competed in the Bahamas only twice.\n2. In both of those competitions, she lost (i.e., was a runner-up).\n\nI'll start by looking through each row of the table to see if any mention the Bahamas as the tournament location.\n\nLooking at the data:\n- Row 0: Tournament is Lachine, Canada\n- Row 1: Hamilton, Canada\n- Row 2: Pelham, United States\n- Row 3: Victoria, Mexico\n- Row 4: Mexico City, Mexico\n- Row 5: Toronto, Canada\n- Row 6: Hamilton, Canada\n- Row 7: Ashland, United States\n- Row 8: Pittsburgh, United States\n- Row 9: Redding, United States\n- Row 10: Vancouver, Canada\n- Row 11: Nassau, Bahamas\n\nSo, the only row mentioning the Bahamas is row 11. Now, checking row 11:\n- Outcome: Winner\n- Tournament: Nassau, Bahamas\n- Opponent: Aliz\u00e9 Cornet\n- Score: 6-4,7-5\n\nSince the outcome is \"winner,\" Wozniak won this match. But according to the claim, she should have lost both times in the Bahamas.\n\nWait, but there's only one entry for the Bahamas. The claim says she competed twice there and lost both. However, based on the table, she only competed once in the Bahamas and was a winner, not a runner-up. \n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it states two competitions with losses, while the data shows only one competition where she won.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE. Wozniak competed once in the Bahamas and won.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"wozniak have lose 9 time between the year 2002 and 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the data. The table has columns: outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, score. Each row represents a match that wozniak played in, from 2002 to 2012.\n\nLooking at the claim, it says wozniak lost 9 times between those years. So I need to count how many times she was a \"runner-up\" because that means she lost.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\nRow 0: outcome is winner (June 30, 2002)\nRow 1: winner (July 17, 2005)\nRow 2: runner-up (October 2, 2005) \u2192 loss\nRow 3: winner (October 16, 2005)\nRow 4: runner-up (October 23, 2005) \u2192 loss\nRow 5: winner (November 13, 2005)\nRow 6: winner (July 23, 2006)\nRow 7: winner (October 1, 2006)\nRow 8: winner (November 12, 2006) with a score of ret.

    "claim": "wozniak have be winner 3 time but never in canada",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"wozniak have be winner 3 time but never in canada\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim to identify what it's asserting. It has two parts: \n\n1. Wozniak has been a winner three times.\n2. Despite these wins, none of them happened in Canada.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row represents an outcome (either \"winner\" or \"runner-up\") along with details like date, tournament location, surface, opponent, and score.\n\nI need to check two things: \n\n- How many times is Wozniak listed as a winner?\n- For those wins, were any of them in Canada?\n\nStarting with the first part. I'll scan through each row's \"outcome\" column to count how many times it says \"winner\". \n\nLooking at the data:\n\nRow 0: outcome is \"winner\"\nRow 1: outcome is \"winner\"\nRow 3: outcome is \"winner\"\nRow 5: outcome is \"winner\"\nRow 6: outcome is \"winner\"\nRow 7: outcome is \"winner\"\nRow 8: outcome is \"winner\"\nRow 10: outcome is \"runner-up\" (so not a win)\nRow 11: outcome is \"winner\"\n\nWait, that's more than three wins. Let me recount:\n\nRows with \"outcome\" as \"winner\" are: 0,1,3,5,6,7,8,11. That's eight times. So the first part of the claim says Wozniak was a winner three times, but according to the table, she has eight wins. Hmm, that seems conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the claim is referring to specific tournaments or opponents? Let me check if all these entries are about Wozniak. Wait, actually, looking at the data, each row's \"opponent\" is someone else, but who is the player in question here? The table doesn't explicitly mention Wozniak as the winner; instead, it lists her as opponents in some rows. \n\nWait a second, I'm confused now. Let me look again. Oh no, perhaps the player in question is the opponent, not necessarily the one with outcome \"winner\". Wait, but the table's structure isn't clear on that. Each row might represent a match where the given player (maybe Wozniak) either won or lost.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here. The table lists outcomes for someone, perhaps the same person each time. So if the outcome is \"winner\", it means they won against the opponent listed in that row. Therefore, each \"winner\" entry represents a win by the player we're considering (maybe Wozniak). \n\nSo counting the number of times \"outcome\" is \"winner\":\n\nRow 0: winner\nRow 1: winner\nRow 3: winner\nRow 5: winner\nRow 6: winner\nRow 7: winner\nRow 8: winner\nRow 11: winner\n\nThat's eight wins, not three. So the first part of the claim that Wozniak has been a winner three times is incorrect based on this data. She has won more than three times.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding who the player is. Maybe the table isn't about Wozniak but another player. Because in row 10 and 3, for example, the opponents are \"olga blahotov\u00e1\" and others, which suggests that maybe the main player's name isn't in the outcome, but perhaps it's someone else.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: The table lists outcomes (winner or runner-up) and details of each match. Each row is a separate event. So if we're talking about Wozniak being the winner, we need to see how many times she appears as the winner in these rows.\n\nBut looking at the \"opponent\" column, I don't see any mention of Wozniak; instead, opponents are names like \"olga blahotov\u00e1\", \"sznapik\", etc. So perhaps this table is about a different player's matches, and Wozniak is one of their opponents.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"wozniak have be winner 3 time\". So if we're considering Wozniak as the winner, how many times does she appear in the \"opponent\" column where the outcome was a win for her? That doesn't make sense because the outcome is about the main player.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this table represents matches that Wozniak participated in. But then, the outcome would be whether she won or lost each match.\n\nWait, no, the structure isn't clear on whose perspective it's from. Maybe I should assume that each row represents a match where Wozniak was the opponent, and the other player is either winning or losing against her.\n\nBut without more context, perhaps the table is listing matches for another player, not Wozniak. So in this case, if we're looking at Wozniak's wins, they wouldn't be represented here because she's listed as the opponent.\n\nWait, that might make sense. So each row represents a match where the main player (perhaps someone else) either won or lost against Wozniak. Therefore, the outcome being \"winner\" would mean that the main player defeated Wozniak in those matches.\n\nBut then, if the claim is about Wozniak's wins, this table doesn't show her wins because she's listed as opponents. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach this differently.\n\nThe claim states that Wozniak has been a winner three times but never in Canada. So to check this, we need to look at the table and see how many times she is listed as \"winner\" and whether any of those wins are in tournaments held in Canada.\n\nBut looking through the data, I don't see any mention of Wozniak as a winner or loser; instead, the opponents are other players. So perhaps this table isn't about Wozniak at all but another player's matches against various opponents, including Wozniak.\n\nIn that case, if we're considering Wozniak's wins, they wouldn't be captured in this table because she is only listed as an opponent. Therefore, the claim might not be directly supported or refuted by this data because it doesn't include Wozniak's own match outcomes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table does list Wozniak's matches. Let me check the \"opponent\" column again. In row 10, the outcome is \"runner-up\", opponent is \"sznapik\", and in row 11, it's a win against \"nys\". But I don't see any mention of Wozniak as an opponent or winner.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: outcome is winner, opponent is \"sznapik\"\nRow 1: winner, opponent \"sznapik\"\nRow 2: runner-up, opponent \"sznapik\"\nRow 3: winner, opponent \"blahotov\u00e1\"\nRow 4: runner-up, opponent \"sznapik\"\nRow 5: winner, opponent \"pereira\"\nRow 6: winner, opponent \"boulter\"\nRow 7: winner, opponent \"kudermetova\"\nRow 8: winner, opponent \"ludm\"\nRow 9: runner-up, opponent \"sznapik\"\nRow 10: runner-up, opponent \"sznapik\"\nRow 11: winner, opponent \"nys\"\n\nSo in none of these rows is Wozniak mentioned as an opponent. Therefore, perhaps this table isn't about Wozniak at all but another player's matches.\n\nIf that's the case, then the claim that \"wozniak have be winner 3 time\" cannot be verified from this data because she isn't listed here. So the claim might not be supported by this table, leading to a FALSE answer.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe Wozniak is the player whose outcomes are listed in these rows. If that's the case, then each row represents her matches. But looking at the \"opponent\" column, it doesn't make sense because opponents would be other players she played against.\n\nBut again, since there's no mention of Wozniak as an opponent or winner in this table, I'm confused about how to connect the data with the claim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is listing matches where Wozniak was the opponent, and each row represents whether another player won or lost against her. In that case, we can see how many times the other player defeated Wozniak (which would be the \"winner\" outcomes) but not how many times Wozniak herself won.\n\nSo if we're trying to find out how many times Wozniak was a winner in her matches, this table doesn't provide that information because it only shows the results from another player's perspective.\n\nGiven all this confusion and lack of direct data about Wozniak's wins or losses, perhaps the claim cannot be confirmed or refuted using this table. However, since the task is to determine based on the given data, I might have to conclude that there isn't enough information here to support the claim, leading to a FALSE answer.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume that the table lists Wozniak's matches and outcomes, but she isn't mentioned in the opponent column, which would be inconsistent. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to note that the data doesn't include Wozniak's wins, making the claim unverifiable from this source.\n\nBut since the task requires providing an answer based on the given data, I might have to infer that there's no information supporting the claim, hence it's FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Wozniak has been a winner three times but never in Canada. However, upon examining the provided table, Wozniak is not listed as either an opponent or a participant. The data only details matches against other players like \"sznapik,\" \"blahotov\u00e1,\" and others. Therefore, there's no information within this table that supports or refutes the claim about Wozniak's wins. \n\nAnswer: FALSE",
