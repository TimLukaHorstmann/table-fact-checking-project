    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"on september 10 , 2013 , the result be 3 - 2\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. The date mentioned is September 10, 2013, and the result should be 3-2. I'll look through each row in the data to find a match for this date.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 4 has the date \"10 september 2013\". That's a match with the claim's date. Now, I need to check the 'result' column in that same row to see if it's 3-2.\n\nIn row 4, under the 'result' column, the value is \"3 - 2\". This exactly matches the result stated in the claim.\n\nSo, both the date and the result from the claim are accurately represented in row 4 of the table. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data provided.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- The date cell in row 4 under 'date'.\n- The result cell in row 4 under 'result'.\n\nThese two pieces of information confirm the claim's accuracy.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"goal for friendly competition be less than 3\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break down how I should approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided in JSON format. It has columns: goal, date, score, result, and competition. The data consists of five rows, each representing a different match with various details.\n\nThe claim is about \"goal for friendly competition be less than 3.\" So, I need to check all the rows where the competition type is \"friendly\" and then see if their corresponding goal numbers are less than 3.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Competition is \"friendly\". The goal value here is 1. Since 1 < 3, this satisfies the condition.\n2. **Row 1**: Also a friendly competition with a goal of 2. Again, 2 < 3, so it meets the claim's requirement.\n3. **Row 2**: The competition isn't friendly; it's \"2011 copa am\u00e9rica\". So I can skip this row as it doesn't apply to our claim.\n4. **Row 3**: Another friendly match with a goal of 1. This is less than 3, so it's good.\n5. **Row 4**: The competition here is \"2014 world cup qualifier\", which isn't friendly. I'll skip this as well.\n\nWait a second, looking back at the claim, it says \"goal for friendly competition be less than 3.\" So each goal in friendly competitions must individually be less than 3. All four friendly matches (rows 0,1,3) have goals of 1 or 2, which are both under 3. \n\nIs there any row where a friendly competition has 3 or more goals? Let me double-check:\n\n- Row 0: 1 goal\n- Row 1: 2 goals\n- Row 3: 1 goal\n\nNo rows with friendly competitions have 3 or more goals. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the data.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the ones under the \"goal\" column for each friendly competition row (rows 0,1,3).\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goal\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the result of a goal larger than 4 be 3 - 1",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to determine if the claim \"the result of a goal larger than 4 be 3 - 1\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that when the number of goals (I assume it's referring to either team's score) is larger than 4, the result should be \"3 - 1.\" So, I'm looking for any row in the table where a goal count exceeds 4 and checking if the result matches \"3 - 1.\"\n\nNow, let me look at each row of the data provided:\n\nRow 0: The date is March 24, 2007. The score is 3-1, and the result is also 3-1. The competition was a friendly match. Here, both teams scored within single digits, so the total goals are 4 (3+1), which isn't larger than 4.\n\nRow 1: March 3, 2010. Score is 1-2, result is 1-2, friendly again. Total goals here are 3, still not exceeding 4.\n\nRow 2: July 9, 2011. The score and result are both 1-0. This adds up to just 1 goal in total, way below the threshold.\n\nRow 3: May 22, 2013. Score is 1-1, but the result after extra time or something might have been 2-1? The score column says \"1 - 1,\" and the result is \"2 - 1.\" Wait, so maybe it's a different competition where they went into extra time. But in this case, the scores are still within single digits; total goals are either 2 or 3, depending on whether I'm counting just the initial game or including any additional.\n\nRow 4: September 10, 2013. The score is 2-1, and the result is 3-2. So, the initial score was 2-1, but perhaps after extra time or penalties, it became 3-2. Here, both teams have scored more than once, but still within single digits.\n\nLooking at all these rows, none of them have a goal count larger than 4 in any of the individual scores. The highest any team has scored is 3 goals (in row 0 and row 4). So, there's no instance where either team has scored more than 4 goals, let alone the result being \"3 - 1\" when that happens.\n\nTherefore, since there are no cases in the table where a goal count exceeds 4, the claim can't be supported by any data. It seems like the claim is making a statement about a scenario that doesn't occur in the provided data. Hence, it's FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks for any instance where a team scores more than 4 goals and whether the result was \"3 - 1.\" Since no such instances exist, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
