    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me figure out how to determine if the claim \"b\u00f6rje jansson's speed be 90.57 mph\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the data array to find where the rider's name is \"b\u00f6rje jansson\". Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: kel carruthers\n- Row 1: rod gould\n- Row 2: g\u00fcnther bartusch\n- Row 3: chas mortimer\n- Row 4: peter berwick\n- Row 5: alex george\n- Row 6: ian richardson\n- Row 7: b\u00f6rje jansson\n\nOkay, found \"b\u00f6rje jansson\" in row index 7. Now I need to check the speed for this rider.\n\nLooking at column names, \"speed\" is one of them, so the relevant column here is \"speed\". In row 7, under the \"speed\" column, it says \"90.57 mph\".\n\nThe claim states that his speed is exactly 90.57 mph. Since the table shows that, the claim matches perfectly.\n\nSo, I'll mark the answer as TRUE and note the relevant cells as row 7 for both the rider name and the speed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"rider\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"speed\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"b\u00f6rje jansson from united kingdom have a speed of 90.57 mph.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for \"b\u00f6rje jansson\" in the rider column. Scanning through the data rows, I find that at row index 8, the rider is \"b\\0xf6rje jansson\". Okay, so that's the correct rider.\n\nNext, the claim mentions he is from the United Kingdom. Looking at the country column for that same row (index 8), it says \"sweden\". Wait a minute, that's different from what the claim states. So according to the table, B\u00f6rje Jansson is from Sweden, not the UK.\n\nThen, checking the speed: in row 8 under the 'speed' column, it's listed as \"90.57 mph\", which matches the claim. However, since the country doesn't match (UK vs Sweden), part of the claim isn't accurate.\n\nTherefore, because one of the conditions (country) is incorrect, the entire claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that B\u00f6rje Jansson is from the United Kingdom when he's actually from Sweden. Although his speed matches, the country discrepancy makes the overall statement FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"rider\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"speed\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
