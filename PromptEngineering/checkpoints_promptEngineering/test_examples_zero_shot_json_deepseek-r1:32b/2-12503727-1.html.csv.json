The columns are: call sign, frequency mhz, city of license, erp w, class, fcc info. There are 7 rows of data.\n\nThe claim states that all broadcast frequencies in megahertz are in class D. So, for each row, I need to check two things: what is the frequency (MHz) and what is its corresponding class.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Row 0:\n   - Frequency MHz: 93.5\n   - Class: d\n\n2. Row 1:\n   - Frequency MHz: 107.5\n   - Class: d\n\n3. Row 2:\n   - Frequency MHz: 103.9\n   - Class: d\n\n4. Row 3:\n   - Frequency MHz: 100.5\n   - Class: d\n\n5. Row 4:\n   - Frequency MHz: 106.7\n   - Class: d\n\n6. Row 5:\n   - Frequency MHz: 93.3\n   - Class: d\n\n7. Row 6:\n   - Frequency MHz: 96.7\n   - Class: d\n\nIn every row, the class is 'd'. There's no variation; all entries under the 'class' column are 'd'. Therefore, all broadcast frequencies in MHz listed in this table are indeed in class D.\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE because for each frequency provided, the corresponding class is D.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"each call sign be unique to the frequency that be broadcast\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that each call sign must be unique for the frequency it broadcasts on. So, if two different stations have the same call sign but are broadcasting on different frequencies, that would violate the claim. Conversely, if a single station has multiple frequencies, that could also cause an issue.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are seven rows of data, each representing a radio station with various attributes: \"call sign\", \"frequency mhz\", and others like \"city of license\" etc.\n\nThe key here is to check for any duplicates in the \"call sign\" column. If all call signs are unique across the entire table, then regardless of their frequencies, the claim would hold true because each call sign corresponds to a single station with its own frequency.\n\nLet me examine the \"call sign\" entries:\n\n1. w228by\n2. w298ak\n3. w280du\n4. w263bb\n5. w294 am\n6. w227bt\n7. w244bd\n\nLooking through these, each one is distinct from the others. There are no repeated call signs in the table. Since all call signs are unique, each one is associated with a single frequency as per their respective rows.\n\nWait, but the claim specifies that each call sign must be unique to its frequency. So even if two stations have different call signs but the same frequency, does that affect anything? Hmm, no. The claim isn't about frequencies being unique; it's about call signs not being shared across different frequencies. So as long as no call sign is used more than once, regardless of frequencies, the claim holds.\n\nIn this table, since all call signs are unique, there's no duplication in that column. Therefore, each call sign corresponds to a single frequency. There are no cases where the same call sign appears with different frequencies or vice versa.\n\nSo, based on the data provided, the claim is TRUE because each call sign is unique and thus tied to only one broadcast frequency.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because all call signs in the table are unique, ensuring each is associated with a single frequency.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the erp w have more value over 100 than under 100\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It claims that in the 'erp w' column of the table, there are more entries with values over 100 than those under 100. So I need to count how many rows have erp_w greater than 100 and how many have less than or equal to 100.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has an 'erp w' value. Let me list out these values:\n\nRow 0: 120\nRow 1: 27\nRow 2: 10\nRow 3: 50\nRow 4: 170\nRow 5: 13\nRow 6: 800\n\nNow, let's classify each of these as over or under/equal to 100.\n\n- Row 0: 120 \u2192 Over 100\n- Row 1: 27 \u2192 Under 100\n- Row 2: 10 \u2192 Under 100\n- Row 3: 50 \u2192 Under 100\n- Row 4: 170 \u2192 Over 100\n- Row 5: 13 \u2192 Under 100\n- Row 6: 800 \u2192 Over 100\n\nNow, let's count the number of rows in each category.\n\nOver 100:\nRow 0, 4, 6 \u2192 That's 3 rows.\n\nUnder or equal to 100:\nRows 1,2,3,5 \u2192 That's 4 rows.\n\nSo, there are 3 rows where erp_w is over 100 and 4 rows where it's under/equal. Therefore, the claim that there are more values over 100 than under is FALSE because 3 is less than 4.\n\nNext, I need to list all relevant cells for each row in the 'erp w' column. Each of these cells contributed to determining whether they were above or below 100.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells should include every cell in the 'erp w' column across all rows because each one was checked against the threshold.\n\nThat gives me 7 cells in total, from row indexes 0 through 6.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"florida be the only state that way - fm broadcast in\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It seems a bit unclear due to possible typos or misphrasing. The user might mean something like \"Florida is the only state broadcasting FM in this way.\" Alternatively, it could imply that all the FM broadcasts listed are from Florida and no other states are present.\n\nLooking at the table, I see the column \"city of license\" which includes entries like \"allapattah, florida\", \"fort pierce, florida\", etc. All cities listed have \"florida\" as their state. The other columns don't directly relate to the claim about being the only state.\n\nSo, checking each row's \"city of license\" column:\n\n- Row 0: allapattah, florida\n- Row 1: fort pierce, florida\n- Row 2: greenacres, florida\n- Row 3: okeechobee, florida\n- Row 4: tradition, florida\n- Row 5: port st lucie, florida\n- Row 6: stuart, florida\n\nAll entries are from Florida.

Hence, the claim that none are unique is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to check are all the \"frequency mhz\" and their corresponding \"call sign\" entries in each row.\n</think>\n\n{  \n   \"answer\":  \"FALSE\",  \n   \"relevant_cells\":  [  \n     {  \n       \"row_index\": 0,  \n       \"column_name\": \"call sign\"  \n     },  \n     {  \n       \"row_index\": 0,  \n       \"column_name\": \"frequency mhz\"  \n     },  \n     {  \n       \"row_index\": 1,  \n       \"column_name\": \"call sign\"  \n     },  \n     {  \n       \"row_index\": 1,  \n       \"column_name\": \"frequency mhz\"  \n     },  \n     {  \n       \"row_index\": 2,  \n       \"column_name\": \"call sign\"  \n     },  \n     {  \n       \"row_index\": 2,  \n       \"column_name\": \"frequency mhz\"  \n     },  \n     {  \n       \"row_index\": 3,  \n       \"column_name\": \"call sign\"  \n     },  \n     {  \n       \"row_index\": 3,  \n       \"column_name\": \"frequency mhz\"  \n     },  \n     {  \n       \"row_index\": 4,  \n       \"column_name\": \"call sign\"  \n     },  \n     {  \n       \"row_index\": 4,  \n       \"column_name\": \"frequency mhz\"  \n     },  \n     {  \n       \"row_index\": 5,  \n       \"column_name\": \"call sign\"  \n     },  \n     {  \n       \"row_index\": 5,  \n       \"column_name\": \"frequency mhz\"  \n     },  \n     {  \n       \"row_index\": 6,  \n       \"column_name\": \"call sign\"  \n     },  \n     {  \n       \"row_index\": 6,  \n       \"column_name\": \"frequency mhz\"  \n     }  \n   ]  \n}",

    "claim": "the erp w have less value over 100 than under 100",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the erp w have less value over 100 than under 100\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems to be comparing two groups: one where the ERP W values are above 100 and another where they're below 100. The claim suggests that there are fewer instances (values) in the over-100 group compared to the under-100 group.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll focus on the \"erp w\" column because that's what the claim is about. The rows have the following ERP W values:\n\n1. 120\n2. 27\n3. 10\n4. 50\n5. 170\n6. 13\n7. 800\n\nNow, I'll categorize these into over 100 and under 100:\n\n- Over 100: 120, 170, 800 \u2192 That's 3 values.\n- Under 100: 27, 10, 50, 13 \u2192 That's 4 values.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says \"less value over 100 than under 100.\" So it's comparing the count of ERP Ws over 100 to those under. From the numbers above:\n\n- Over 100: 3 entries\n- Under 100: 4 entries\n\nSo, there are indeed fewer values over 100 (3) compared to under 100 (4). That seems to support the claim as TRUE.\n\nBut let me double-check each row to ensure I didn't miss any:\n\nRow 0: ERP W is 120 \u2192 Over\nRow 1: 27 \u2192 Under\nRow 2: 10 \u2192 Under\nRow 3: 50 \u2192 Under\nRow 4: 170 \u2192 Over\nRow 5: 13 \u2192 Under\nRow 6: 800 \u2192 Over\n\nYes, that's correct. Three over and four under.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE because there are fewer ERP W values above 100 than below.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are fewer ERP W values above 100 than below. By examining each row, we find three instances where ERP W exceeds 100 and four instances where it's under. Therefore, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_erp_w_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"maryland be the only state that way - fm broadcast in\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the claim: It seems a bit unclear because of possible typos or grammatical issues. But I think the intended meaning is that Maryland is the only state where FM broadcasts occur. Or maybe it's saying that Maryland is the only state that has FM broadcasts in a certain way? The phrasing isn't very clear, but given the context, I'll assume it means Maryland is the sole state represented for FM broadcasts in this table.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided. The columns are \"call sign\", \"frequency mhz\", \"city of license\", \"erp w\", \"class\", and \"fcc info\". The data rows have information about different radio stations, with each row representing a station's details.\n\nI need to check if all the entries in the table come from Maryland. But wait, looking at the \"city of license\" column for each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Allapattah, Florida\n2. Row 1: Fort Pierce, Florida\n3. Row 2: Greenacres, Florida\n4. Row 3: Okeechobee, Florida\n5. Row 4: Tradition, Florida\n6. Row 5: Port St Lucie, Florida\n7. Row 6: Stuart, Florida\n\nSo every single entry is from a city in Florida, not Maryland. Therefore, the claim that Maryland is the only state with FM broadcasts based on this table isn't supported because all the data points to Florida.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells are each row's \"city of license\" column because they show that all stations are licensed in Florida, not Maryland.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"city of license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"city of license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"city of license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"city of license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"city of license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"city of license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"city of license\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
