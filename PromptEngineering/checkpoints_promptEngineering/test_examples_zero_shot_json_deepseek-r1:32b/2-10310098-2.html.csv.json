    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the given claim about a fighter is true based on the data provided in the table. The claim states two things: that the fighter won against Paul Weremecki with a TKO (using a head kick and punches) and also won against Gary Padilla with a split decision.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the data. The JSON object has an \"events\" array where each element represents a match. Each event includes details like the opponent's name, result, method, etc.\n\nI need to find the rows where the opponent is Paul Weremecki and Gary Padilla. For each, I should check if the result was a win and the method matches what's claimed.\n\nStarting with Paul Weremecki: I'll scan through each row in the events array looking for \"Paul Weremecki\" under the \"Opponent\" column. Once found, I'll note the row index. Then, I'll check if the \"Result\" is \"win\" and if the \"Method\" is \"tko (head kick and punches)\". \n\nNext, I'll do the same for Gary Padilla: find his row, check if the result was a win, and if the method was a split decision.\n\nLooking through the data:\n\nFor Paul Weremecki:\n- Found in row 16. The opponent is \"paul weremecki\", result is \"win\", method is \"tko (head kick and punches)\". This matches the claim.\n\nFor Gary Padilla:\n- Found in row 20. Opponent is \"gary padilla\", result is \"win\", method is \"decision (split)\". This also matches the claim.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, so the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Method\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"both fight with opponent shamil abdurahimov and houston alexander be loss with method tko  (punches) for both\". \n\nFirst, let me parse the claim carefully. It's saying that two fights happened against these two opponents, Shamil Abdurakhimov and Houston Alexander, and in both cases, the outcome was a loss via TKO by punches.\n\nI'll look through each row of the data to find entries where the opponent is either Shamil Abdurakhimov or Houston Alexander. Then I need to check if the result (win/loss) and the method of the fight match the claim.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n1. The first relevant cell is when the opponent is Shamil Abdurakhimov. Scanning through, I find row 34: {\"Opponent\": \"shamil abdurahimov\", ...}. The result here is \"loss\" and the method is \"tko (punches)\". So that part checks out.\n\n2. Next, checking for Houston Alexander as the opponent. Looking through all rows, I don't see any entry where the opponent is Houston Alexander. Wait, maybe I missed it? Let me go row by row. Row 35 is against luiz can\u00e9, row 36: kazuhiro nakamura... Hmm, no, I don't find an opponent named Houston Alexander in the data.\n\nSince one part of the claim (Shamil Abdurakhimov) is supported but the other (Houston Alexander) isn't present, the entire claim can't be fully supported.

The claim says that the fight with opponent Gary Padilla was in San Diego, California, United States, and the fight with Paul Weremecki was in Portland, Oregon, United States.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. The table has several rows, each representing a different fight, and columns like Result, Opponent, Method, Event, Round, Time, and Location. \n\nI need to find the specific fights mentioned in the claim. So, I'll search for Gary Padilla and Paul Weremecki in the Opponent column.\n\nLooking through the table, I see that at row index 24 (if counting from 0), there's an entry with Opponent \"gary padilla\". The Location for this fight is listed as \"san diego  , california  , united states\".\n\nNext, for Paul Weremecki, I find him in another row. It looks like he's at row index 21 (again, assuming the first data row is index 0). His Location is \"portland  , oregon  , united state\".\n\nWait a second, the Location for Gary Padilla is spelled with two spaces after commas and says \"united states\", while Paul's location has one space and says \"united state\". The claim mentions \"united state\" as well. So even though it's slightly different in spelling (plural vs singular), both locations are correct according to the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data.

The table has multiple rows, each representing a match with details like date, event, opponent, method, etc., but specifically looking for the 'Country' column to determine where the matches took place.\n\nThe claim mentions four countries outside the US: Japan (specifically Saitama), England (Birmingham), and Australia (Brisbane). I need to check each of these locations in the 'Country' column across all rows.\n\nLet me go through each relevant cell:\n\n1. **Saitama, Japan**: Looking for any row where the country is Japan. Scanning through, there are multiple entries with \"saitama  , japan\". For example:\n   - Row 25: Country is saitama  , japan\n   - Row 26: saitama  , japan\n   - Others as well.\n\n2. **Birmingham, England**: I need to find if any match was held in Birmingham, England. Checking each row's country:\n   - Found a row where the country is \"birmingham  , england\". Specifically, Row 31 has Country: birmingham  , england.\n\n3. **Brisbane, Australia**: Looking for Brisbane or Australia. There's a match in Row 29 with Country: brisbane  , australia.\n\nSo each of these locations (Saitama Japan, Birmingham England, Brisbane Australia) are present in the table under the 'Country' column. \n\nAdditionally, I should ensure that these entries are indeed outside the US.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user provided a claim about a fighter losing two matches and wants to verify if it's true or false based on a table of fight results.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The table has multiple rows, each representing a match with details like opponent, result (win or loss), method of finish, etc. Each row has columns like \"Opponent,\" \"Method,\" and others that might be relevant.\n\nThe claim says the fighter lost against Paul Weremecki via TKO (head kick and punches) and also lost to Gary Padilla with a split decision. So, I need to check if these two losses are accurately represented in the table.\n\nLet me start by looking for the match against Paul Weremecki. Scanning through the rows, I find a row where the opponent is Paul Weremecki. In that row, the result is \"win,\" which contradicts the claim that it was a loss. Wait, maybe I misread? Let me double-check. No, the result is indeed a win for our fighter, not a loss as the claim suggests.\n\nNext, checking the method of finish against Paul Weremecki: the method is listed as TKO (head kick and punches), which matches the claim's description. But since the result was a win, this part doesn't hold true because the claim says it was a loss.\n\nNow, moving on to Gary Padilla. Looking through the rows again, I find that our fighter faced Gary Padilla and won via a split decision. The claim states it was a loss with a split decision, which is incorrect since our fighter actually won that match.\n\nPutting this together: both parts of the claim are incorrect. The first part about losing to Paul Weremecki isn't true because the result was a win. The second part about losing to Gary Padilla via a split decision is also false; it was a win for our fighter. Therefore, the entire claim is not supported by the data in the table.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"Method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"Method\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the provided fight data. The claim says that two specific fights against Glover Teixeira and Jan Nortje had certain outcomes and methods.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into parts. It mentions two fights:\n\n1. Against Glover Teixeira: The result was a loss by KO via punches.\n2. Against Jan Nortje: The result was a win with a TKO via punches.\n\nI'll need to look through each row of the data table to find these two opponents and check their respective outcomes and methods.\n\nLooking at the data, each row represents a different fight. Each row has several columns like Opponent, Result, Method, etc. My task is to locate the rows where the opponent is Glover Teixeira and Jan Nortje, then verify the result and method for each.\n\nStarting with Glover Teixeira:\n\nI'll scan through the Opponent column until I find \"glover teixeira\". Let me go row by row:\n\n- Row 16: Opponent is renato sobral... no.\n- Row 17: lyoto machida... no.\n- Row 18: kazuhiro nakamura... no.\n- Row 19: ricardo arona... no.\n- Row 20: antonio rogerio nogueira... no.\n- Row 21: glover teixeira. Yes, found it.\n\nSo row 21 has opponent Glover Teixeira. The result is a loss (since the first number in Result is less than the second). Method is KO via punches. So this matches the claim.\n\nNow for Jan Nortje:\n\nAgain, scanning the Opponent column:\n\n- Row 23: kazuhiro nakamura... no.\n- Row 24: lyoto machida... no.\n- Row 25: ricardo arona... no.\n- Row 26: antonio rogerio nogueira... no.\n- Row 27: glover teixeira... already checked.\n- Row 28: paul weremecki... no.\n- Row 29: gary padilla... no.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some. Let me go back a bit. Looking through the list again:\n\nLooking at row indexes in order, from 0 to 29.\n\nRow 16: renato sobral\nRow 17: lyoto machida\nRow 18: kazuhiro nakamura\nRow 19: ricardo arona\nRow 20: antonio rogerio nogueira\nRow 21: glover teixeira (checked)\nRow 22: luiz can\u00e9... no.\nRow 23: kazuhiro nakamura? Wait, row 23 is Opponent: kazuhiro nakamura. Then row 24: lyoto machida.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier because the rows go from 0 to let's see how many there are. The data has 30 entries (indices 0-29). Let me recount:\n\nLooking for Jan Nortje in Opponent column.

Alternatively, maybe Jan Nortje is in another row.\n\nLooking again:\n\nThe data starts with the first fight at index 0, and ends at index 29. Let me check each opponent from top to bottom until I find Jan Nortje.\n\nRow 0: chris weidman\nRow 1: robert whittaker\n...\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for \"jan nortje\" in the Opponent column. Alternatively, maybe he's listed as \"Jan Nortje\" with a capital J.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: chris weidman... no.\nRow 1: robert whittaker... no.\n...\nWait, perhaps I need to check all rows again carefully.\n\nAfter checking, I find that in the data provided, there is a fight against Jan Nortje at index 25.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Jan Nortje is listed earlier. Let me check row by row:\n\nLooking at the data again, perhaps I overlooked him.

Alternatively, maybe Jan Nortje isn't in this data? But the claim says he is, so that can't be right.\n\nWait, no\u2014looking again, perhaps row 19 has Opponent: ricardo arona...

Or perhaps it's correct)\nWait, but in the data provided, row 21 is \"glover teixeira\"? Let me check:\n\nIn the original data, row 21 is indeed \"glover teixeira\", which might be a typo for \"Glover Teixeira\". So Glover Teixeira is at row 21.\n\nBut where is Jan Nortje? Hmm. Maybe I missed it earlier.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps in row 19: Opponent is ricardo arona... No. Row 20: antonio rogerio nogueira.\n\nWait a minute\u2014maybe Jan Nortje isn't in this data. That would mean the claim might be incorrect or there's an error in the data provided.\n\nBut according to the user, I'm supposed to process this task assuming that both fights are present. Therefore, perhaps I need to proceed with what is given.\n\nWait, but let me check once more:\n\nRows 0-29:\n\nRow 0: chris weidman\n1: robert whittaker\n2: stefan struve\n3: rodrigo danao\n4: thomas saraiva\n5: max holloway\n6: jeremy stephens\n7: rafael dos anjos\n8: marcelo-rodrigues-silva\n9: paulo thiago\n10: edson barboza\n11: kevyn rodriguez\n12: daniel weber\n13: jose ribeiro\n14: hector luna\n15: jake mcelroy\n16: renato sobral\n17: lyoto machida\n18: kazuhiro nakamura\n19: ricardo arona\n20: antonio rogerio nogueira\n21: Glover Teixeira (assuming typo)\n22: luiz can\u00e9\n23: kazuhiro nakamura\nWait, perhaps Jan Nortje is not in the data provided. That's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in counting rows. Let me count carefully:\n\nThe data provided by the user lists 30 fights (rows 0-29). After checking each row, I can't find a fight against Jan Nortje. Therefore, perhaps there is a mistake in the data or the claim.\n\nBut assuming that both fights are present, as per the task, perhaps I need to adjust my approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"glover teixeira\" at row 21 is intended to be Glover Teixeira, who is a known fighter. So perhaps that's correct.\n\nTherefore, in this data, there is a fight against Glover Teixeira (row 21) and a fight against Glover Teixeira again at row 23? That seems unlikely unless it's the same fight listed twice or an error.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misreading the rows. Let me check again:\n\nRow 18: kazuhiro nakamura\nRow 19: ricardo arona\nRow 20: antonio rogerio nogueira\nRow 21: Glover Teixeira (if typo corrected)\nRow 22: luiz can\u00e9\nRow 23: kazuhiro nakamura... Hmm, that seems like a duplicate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the data includes two fights against Kazuhiro Nakamura? That could be possible if he fought twice in this list.\n\nBut regarding Jan Nortje, I don't see his name in any row. Therefore, unless there's an error in the data or my reading, it seems that Jan Nortje isn't listed here.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the task is to extract information about fights against Glover Teixeira and another fighter, but since Jan Nortje isn't present, I might need to adjust accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"glover teixeira\" at row 21 is a typo for someone else. Perhaps it's intended to be \"Glover Nogueira\"? Or perhaps the user made a mistake in listing the data.\n\nIn any case, proceeding with what is given: there's one fight against Glover Teixeira (assuming that's correct) and no fight against Jan Nortje.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the task is to process fights against both fighters regardless of their presence in the data. But that doesn't make sense as we can't extract information about a fighter not present.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the user made an error in providing the data or in the query.\n\nGiven this confusion, I think the best approach is to clarify: inform the user that Jan Nortje's fight isn't listed in the provided data, but proceed with extracting information about Glover Teixeira as per row 21.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was a typo and \"glover teixeira\" should be \"jan nortje\". But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nIn any case, moving forward, I'll assume that the intended fighters are present and extract their fight details accordingly.\n</think>\n\nTo address the task of extracting information about fights against Glover Teixeira and Jan Nortje from the provided data:\n\n1. **Glover Teixeira**:\n   - Found in row 21: \"glover teixeira\" (likely a typo for \"Glover Teixeira\").\n   - Additional details would depend on other columns, which aren't specified here.\n\n2. **Jan Nortje**:\n   - Not found in the provided data.\n   - It's possible there was an error in data entry or a typo; perhaps it was intended to be listed elsewhere.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGlover Teixeira's fight is noted in row 21, but Jan Nortje isn't present in the provided dataset. Please verify the data for accuracy or provide additional information if necessary.",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the data provided. The claim says that both fights against opponents Shamil Abdurahimov and Houston Alexander resulted in wins with the method of TKO (punches) for both.\n\nFirst, I need to look through each row of the table to find the relevant fights. Let's go step by step.\n\nLooking at the data, each row represents a fight. The columns are: Result, Opponent, Method, Event, Round, Time, Location.\n\nThe claim mentions two opponents: Shamil Abdurahimov and Houston Alexander. I need to check if both of these opponents have fights where the result was a win for the fighter (I assume it's the same fighter in all cases) with the method being TKO by punches.\n\nStarting from the top, let me scan each row:\n\nRow 0: Opponent is someone else.\n...\nWait, actually, I need to check each opponent name. Let's look through each opponent column:\n\nLooking at Row 17 (index starting at 0): Opponent is Shamil Abdurahimov. Result is \"loss\". So the result was a loss, not a win. The method is submission via D'arce choke. This doesn't fit the claim because it's a loss and the method isn't TKO by punches.\n\nNext, looking for Houston Alexander: I don't see that name in any opponent column. Let me check all rows:\n\nRow 0: Opponent is someone else.\nRow 1: ...\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. The opponent names are a bit varied. Wait, the claim mentions \"houston alexander\" and \"shamil abdurahimov\". Let's see.\n\nIn row 23: Opponent is Lyoto Machida. No. Row 24: Ricardo Arona. No. Row 25: Antonio Rogerio Nogueira. No. Row 26: Glover Teixeira. No. Row 27: Paul Weremecki. No. Row 28: Gary Padilla. No.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking for \"houston alexander\" but in the data, it's spelled as \"houston alexander\"? Or maybe it's a different spelling. Wait, checking all opponents:\n\nLooking through each opponent name:\n- Shamil Abdurahimov is present (row 17).\n- Houston Alexander: I don't see that exact name. Maybe there's a typo? Let me check again.\n\nWait, in row 26: Opponent is Glover Teixeira, method KO by punches. Result is loss. No.\n\nRow 24: Ricardo Arona, result win, method KO by punch and soccer kick.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the claim refers to two fights where both opponents were defeated with TKO via punches.\n\nWait, let me check each row for opponent names Shamil Abdurahimov and Houston Alexander:\n\n- Row 17: Opponent is Shamil Abdurahimov, result loss, method submission (D'arce choke). So this doesn't fit.\n- Looking for Houston Alexander: I don't see that name in the opponents. The closest is \"luiz can\u00e9\" or others, but not Houston Alexander.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through each row carefully:\n\nRow 0: Opponent is someone else.\n...\nWait, looking again at all rows:\n\n- Row 17: Shamil Abdurahimov\n- Now, checking for Houston Alexander in the opponent column. Not found. Maybe it's a different spelling or perhaps I'm misreading.\n\nLooking back, perhaps I missed the row with Houston Alexander. Let me check each opponent name again:\n\nRow 0: Opponent is \"someone else\" (not relevant)\nRow 1: ...\nWait, perhaps I need to go through each row one by one.\n\nAfter checking all rows, I don't find an opponent named Houston Alexander. So the claim mentions two opponents, but only Shamil Abdurahimov exists in the data, and that fight was a loss with a different method.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported because:\n\n1. The fight against Shamil Abdurahimov resulted in a loss, not a win.\n2. There's no opponent named Houston Alexander in the table.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are the ones where the fights occurred with these opponents and their results and methods.\n\nWait, but the claim says both fights were wins with TKO by punches. Since one is missing, it's false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both fights against Shamil Abdurahimov and Houston Alexander resulted in wins via TKO (punches). Checking the data:\n\n- Shamil Abdurahimov: Fight resulted in a loss, method submission (D'arce choke).\n- Houston Alexander: Not found in the opponent list.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Result\": \"False\",\n  \"Explanation\": \"The fight against Shamil Abdurahimov was a loss, and there's no record of a fight against Houston Alexander.\"\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this claim to verify: \"the fight with opponent gary padilla be in saitama, japan while the fight with opponent paul weremecki be in mississauga, ontario, canada\". I need to check if both parts of this statement are correct based on the provided data.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part is saying. The claim is making two separate statements:\n\n1. The fight against Gary Padilla was held in Saitama, Japan.\n2. The fight against Paul Weremecki was held in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada.\n\nI need to look through the data table provided and find the relevant entries for both opponents. Each row in the table represents a different fight, with various details like opponent name, result, method, event, etc., including the location of the fight.\n\nLet me start by searching for Gary Padilla. I'll go through each row's Opponent column to see if his name is there. Scanning down, I find that in the second last row (row index 24), the opponent is Gary Padilla. The Location column for this row says \"saitama  , japan\", which matches the claim. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, I'll look for Paul Weremecki. Going through each row again, I find his name in the third last row (row index 23). The Location here is listed as \"portland  , oregon  , united states\". Wait a minute, that's different from what the claim says. The claim mentions Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, but according to this data, it was in Portland, Oregon, USA.\n\nHmm, so while the first part of the claim is correct, the second part isn't. The fight against Paul Weremecki wasn't in Canada; it was actually in the United States. Therefore, the overall claim isn't fully supported by the data because one part is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that two specific fights took place in particular locations. Checking the data:\n\n- **Gary Padilla**'s fight location matches Saitama, Japan (row 24).\n- **Paul Weremecki**'s fight was actually in Portland, Oregon, USA, not Mississauga, Ontario, Canada (row 23).\n\nSince one part is incorrect, the claim isn't fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the data provided. The claim states: \"the fighter have match in country inside of the united state include saitama  , japan  , birmingham  , england  , and brisbane  , australia\".\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim carefully. It mentions that the fighter has matches in several countries within the United States. Wait, that doesn't make sense because Saitama is in Japan, Birmingham is in England (UK), and Brisbane is in Australia. These are all outside the United States. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, maybe I misread it. The claim says \"inside of the united state include saitama , japan , birmingham , england , and brisbane , australia\". That seems contradictory because those places aren't inside the US. Maybe the claim is stating that the fighter has matches in these countries, regardless of whether they're inside the US or not.\n\nBut looking at the data structure provided, there's a list of fights with details including \"Venue\" which I assume indicates the location of each fight. Each row in the table has an index (row_index) and various columns like Result, Opponent, etc., but importantly, there's a column for Venue where the location is specified.\n\nSo, to check the claim, I need to look through each row and see if any venues match saitama, japan; birmingham, england; and brisbane, australia. \n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Row 0: Venue is \"saitama , japan\" \u2014 matches.\n- Row 1: Venue is \"birmingham  , england\" \u2014 matches.\n- Row 3: Venue is \"portland  , oregon  , united states\" \u2014 no.\n- Row 4: Venue is \"san diego  , california  , united states\" \u2014 no.\n- ...\n- Row 12: Venue is \"birmingham  , england\" \u2014 matches again.\n- ...\n- Row 15: Venue is \"brisbane  , australia\" \u2014 matches.\n\nWait, I need to check each row for these venues. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nRow 0: Venue is \"saitama , japan\" \u2014 yes, that's in Japan.\nRow 1: Venue is \"birmingham , england\" \u2014 yes, that's in England.\n...\nLooking further down:\nRow 12: Venue is \"birmingham , england\" again.\nRow 15: Venue is \"brisbane , australia\".\n\nSo the fighter has matches in Saitama (Japan), Birmingham (England), and Brisbane (Australia). These are all outside the United States. The claim says these locations are inside the US, which is incorrect.\n\nWait no\u2014the claim's wording might be confusing. It says, \"the fighter have match in country inside of the united state include saitama  , japan  , birmingham  , england  , and brisbane  , australia\". That seems to suggest that these venues are within the US, which they aren't.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is just listing countries where the fighter has matches, regardless of whether they're inside or outside the US. But the wording says \"inside of the united state include...\", which implies that saitama etc., are inside the US, which isn't true.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because those locations aren't in the United States.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells indicate matches in countries outside the United States, so the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
