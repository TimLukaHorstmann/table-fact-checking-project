    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"active from 1947 - 1964, titus ozon score 157 goal\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided in JSON format. The columns are rank, name, years, matches, and goals. There are 10 rows of data corresponding to different players with their respective stats.\n\nThe claim has two parts:\n1. Titus Ozon was active from 1947 to 1964.\n2. He scored 157 goals.\n\nI need to check each part against the table.\n\nStarting with the first part, I'll search for \"titus ozon\" in the 'name' column. Scanning through the data rows, I see that row index 9 has the name \"titus ozon\". So that's the relevant cell here: row 9, column 'name'.\n\nNext, checking the years he was active. The claim says 1947 - 1964. Looking at the same row (index 9), under the 'years' column, it shows \"1947 - 1964\". That matches exactly with what's in the claim. So another relevant cell is row 9, column 'years'.\n\nNow for the goals part: the claim states he scored 157 goals. Looking at the same row, under the 'goals' column, it says 157. This also aligns perfectly with the claim.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are fully supported by the data in the table, I can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nTo summarize:\n- The name \"titus ozon\" is found at row index 9.\n- His active years are indeed 1947 - 1964 as per the 'years' column.\n- He scored exactly 157 goals as shown in the 'goals' column.\n\nTherefore, all relevant cells confirm the claim's accuracy.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 9,\n       \"column_name\": \"name\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 9,\n       \"column_name\": \"years\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 9,\n       \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"during the year of 1950 through 1965, the goal score be less than 160\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems to state that from 1950 to 1965, all players (since it's about goals) scored fewer than 160 goals each in those years. Or maybe it's referring to total goals during that period? The wording is a bit unclear, but I'll assume it means each year within that range had goal scores below 160.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists players with their ranks, names, active years, matches played, and goals scored. So, each row represents a player's career stats.\n\nThe claim is about a specific time period (1950-1965). I need to check which players were active during that time. The \"years\" column shows the span for each player. Let me go through each player:\n\n1. Dudu Georgescu: 1970 - 1986 \u2192 Not active in 1950-1965.\n2. Ionel Danciulescu: 1993 - present \u2192 Active way after the period.\n3. Rodion Camataru: 1974 - 1989 \u2192 Also not during 1950-1965.\n4. Marin Radu: Same as above, 1974-1989.\n5. Ion Oblemenco: 1964 - 1976 \u2192 He was active in 1964, which is within the upper end of the period (1950-1965). So, part of his career overlaps with 1964.\n6. Florea Dumitrache: 1966 - 1983 \u2192 His earliest year is 1966, just outside the 1965 cutoff.\n7. Mircea Sandu: 1970 - 1987 \u2192 No overlap with 1950-1965.\n8. Victor Piturca: 1975 - 1989 \u2192 No overlap.\n9. Mihai Adam: 1962 - 1976 \u2192 He was active from 1962 onwards, so part of his career is in the latter years of the period (up to 1965).\n10. Titus Ozon: 1947 - 1964 \u2192 His last year is 1964, which is within the range.\n\nWait a minute, so players 5, 9, and 10 were active during parts of the period in question. Specifically, Ion Oblemenco (row 4) was active up to 1976 but started in 1964, which is within 1950-1965? Wait, no: 1964 is within the upper bound of 1965, so yes. Similarly, Mihai Adam (row 8) was active from 1962 to 1976, so he played in 1962-1965 during our period. Titus Ozon (row 9) was active until 1964.\n\nNow, for each of these players, I need to check their goals scored during the years they were active within 1950-1965. However, the table doesn't provide per-year data; it only gives total goals across their entire careers. So, we don't have exact numbers for each year in that range.\n\nBut perhaps the claim is interpreted as whether any player's total goals from 1950 to 1965 were less than 160. Or maybe it's about whether all players during those years had goals under 160. The wording isn't entirely clear, but given the data, I think we can check if any of these active players scored at least one goal above or equal to 160 in that period.\n\nLooking at Ion Oblemenco: his total career goals are 170 (row 4). He played from 1964-1976. So during 1950-1965, he was active only in 1964 and maybe part of 1965? His total goals could be less than 160 if most were scored after 1965. But without per-year data, we can't know for sure.\n\nSimilarly, Mihai Adam has 160 goals (row 8) across his entire career from 1962-1976. If he played in 1962-1965, did he score more than or equal to 160 during that time? Again, no data.\n\nTitus Ozon has 157 goals (row 9) over his career up to 1964. So if all his goals were scored by 1964, and the claim is about 1950-1965, then Titus scored 157 in that period. That's less than 160, which would support the claim.\n\nIon Oblemenco: total of 170, but if he played only from 1964 onwards, his goals in 1950-1965 might be lower. Let's say he scored, for example, 20 goals in 1964 and maybe part of 1965. That would still keep him under 160.\n\nHowever, without exact per-year data, we can't definitively confirm the claim. The problem is that we don't have annual goal counts for these players during 1950-1965. So based on the given data, which only provides total career goals, we can't conclusively verify if all players in that period scored under 160.\n\nWait, but looking back, maybe I misread: the claim might be whether any player had at least one year with over 160 goals during 1950-1965. But again, without per-year data, we can't confirm that either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is about the total number of goals scored by all players in the league during those years being under 160. That seems unlikely because that would be a very low total.\n\nWait no, maybe it's about individual player performance. The user didn't specify, but given the data, I think we need to look at whether any of the active players had goal counts that exceeded 160 in those years. But without per-year stats, it's impossible to tell from the table provided.\n\nTherefore, based on the information available, we can't definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, if we consider that Titus Ozon scored only 157 goals in his entire career (up to 1964), which is just under 160, it's possible that during the years 1950-1965, no single player reached or exceeded 160 goals. But this is an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, if a player like Ion Oblemenco scored more than 160 in his entire career (170), and part of that was during 1950-1965, it's possible he might have had some years over the threshold, but again, without knowing per-year stats.\n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of data, perhaps the answer is that we can't confirm from the given table whether any player scored at least 160 goals in a season during 1950-1965 because there's no per-season breakdown.\n</think>\n\nBased on the provided table, we cannot definitively confirm or deny whether any footballer scored at least 160 goals in a season between 1950 and 1965. The table only provides total career goals for each player and does not include yearly statistics, making it impossible to determine if any individual exceeded the 160-goal threshold in a single season during that period.\n\n**Answer:** The data provided is insufficient to confirm or deny whether any footballer scored at least 160 goals in a season between 1950 and 1965.",
