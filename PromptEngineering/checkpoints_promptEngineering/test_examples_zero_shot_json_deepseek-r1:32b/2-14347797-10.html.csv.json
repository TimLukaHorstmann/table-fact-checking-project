    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table in JSON format. The claim is: \"the opponent for april 14 be the new jersey devil\". \n\nFirst, let me parse the table structure. It has columns: game, date, opponent, score, series. And there are five rows of data.\n\nThe claim mentions the date \"april 14\" and the opponent being the New Jersey Devils. So I need to check which row corresponds to April 14th and see what's listed under the opponent column for that row.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 0: Date is april 8, opponent is new jersey devils.\n- Row 1: Date is april 10, same opponent.\n- Row 2: Date is april 12, same opponent.\n- Row 3: Date is april 14, opponent is new jersey devils.\n- Row 4: Date is april 17, still the same opponent.\n\nSo, for April 14th (row index 3), the opponent is indeed the New Jersey Devils. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI should also note which cells were relevant to this determination. The date column was used to find the correct row, and the opponent column from that row confirms the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
