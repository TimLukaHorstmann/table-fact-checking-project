    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the size of the crowd when essendon be the away team be 28158.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. So, it's saying that whenever Essendon was the away team in a game, the crowd size was 28,158. To verify this, I'll look through the table data.\n\nLooking at the columns: \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", \"away team score\", \"venue\", \"crowd\", and \"date\". The relevant parts are the \"away team\" and the \"crowd\".\n\nI'll go through each row of data:\n\n1. First row: Home team is Collingwood, away team is St Kilda. Crowd size here is 16,500. Not Essendon.\n2. Second row: Carlton vs Richmond. Away team is Richmond. Crowd is 25,863. Not relevant.\n3. Third row: Melbourne vs Hawthorn. Away team is Hawthorn. Crowd is 26,708. Still not Essendon.\n4. Fourth row: South Melbourne vs Footscray. Away team is Footscray. Crowd is 19,500. Not applicable.\n5. Fifth row: North Melbourne vs Fitzroy. Away team is Fitzroy. Crowd is 11,000. Doesn't fit.\n6. Sixth row: Geelong vs Essendon. Here, Essendon is the away team. The crowd size here is 28,158.\n\nSo in this case, when Essendon was the away team (sixth row), the crowd was indeed 28,158. There's only one instance where Essendon was the away team, and the crowd matched exactly what the claim states. \n\nI don't see any other rows where Essendon is listed as the away team with a different crowd size, so this seems to hold true. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"the size of the crowd when essendon be the away team be 25158\". Hmm, I think there might be a typo here since \"be\" is used twice. It probably means that when Essendon was the away team, the crowd size was 25158.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd number, and date. I need to find which row has Essendon as the away team and check the corresponding crowd figure.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Row 0: Home team is Collingwood, away team is St Kilda. So Essendon isn't here.\n2. Row 1: Home team is Carlton, away team is Richmond. Not relevant.\n3. Row 2: Melbourne vs Hawthorn. No.\n4. Row 3: South Melbourne vs Footscray. Still not.\n5. Row 4: North Melbourne vs Fitzroy. Nope.\n6. Row 5: Geelong vs Essendon. Here, Essendon is the away team.\n\nSo in row 5, the away team is Essendon. Now, what's the crowd size there? It says 28158. The claim states that the crowd was 25158 when Essendon was the away team. But according to the table, it's 28158, not 25158.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the crowd number doesn't match.\n\nThe relevant cells here are in row 5 where Essendon is listed as the away team and the crowd size in that same row.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table in JSON format. The claim is: \"the away team's score at the game when hawthorn be the home team be 9.11 (65)\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that when Hawthorn was the home team, their away opponent scored 9.11 (65). Wait, actually, the wording might be a bit confusing. Let me parse it again: \"the away team's score at the game when hawthorn be the home team\". So, in other words, during a game where Hawthorn was playing as the home team, what was the away team's score? The claim says that score is 9.11 (65).\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game. Each game has columns: \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", \"away team score\", etc. So for each game, I can check if Hawthorn is the home team and then see what their away opponent's score was.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one to find where Hawthorn is the home team.\n\nRow 0: Home team is Collingwood. Not Hawthorn.\nRow 1: Home team is Carlton. No.\nRow 2: Home team is Melbourne. No.\nRow 3: Home team is South Melbourne. No.\nRow 4: North Melbourne as home. No.\nRow 5: Geelong as home. No.\n\nWait, I don't see any row where Hawthorn is the home team. All rows have different home teams. So in none of these games does Hawthorn appear as the home team. Therefore, there's no data to support that when Hawthorn was home, their away opponent scored 9.11 (65). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the claim. Maybe it's about when hawthorn was the away team? But the claim specifically says \"when hawthorn be the home team\". So no, my initial assessment holds.\n\nSo since there's no game in this table where Hawthorn is the home team, the claim can't be true because there's no such data. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table doesn't have a row where Hawthorn is the home team, so the claim isn't supported by the given data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
