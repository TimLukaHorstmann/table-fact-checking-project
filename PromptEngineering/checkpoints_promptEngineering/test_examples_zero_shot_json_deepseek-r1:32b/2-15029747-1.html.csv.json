It says that Brandi Love was nominated for two awards at the AVN Award ceremony in 2013. So my task is to check if there are exactly two nominations under the AVN Awards in 2013.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: year, ceremony, result, award, work. The data rows have entries for each of these.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 0:\n- Year: 2013\n- Ceremony: AVN Award\n- Result: Nominated\n- Award: MILF/Cougar Performer of the Year\nThis is a nomination, so that's one.\n\nRow 1:\n- Year: 2013\n- Ceremony: AVN Award\n- Result: Nominated\n- Award: Most Outrageous Sex Scene (with Kelly Madison)\nAnother nomination. That makes two.\n\nRows 2 and 3 are from the Nightmoves Award, so they don't count towards the AVN Awards.\n\nRow 4 is from the XBIZ Award, which also isn't relevant here.\n\nSo in total, there are two nominations for Brandi Love at the AVN Award ceremony in 2013.

Is there a nomination for \"best ass\"?\n2.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"brandi love be nominate for a total of 5 award in 2013\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what's being asked here.\n\nFirst, the table has data about awards, specifically looking at the year 2013. Each row represents an event where Brandi Love was either nominated or won an award. The columns are \"year,\" \"ceremony,\" \"result,\" \"award,\" and \"work.\"\n\nThe claim is that she was nominated for a total of five awards in 2013. So, I need to count how many times she was nominated across all the rows provided.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: Year 2013, AVN Award, result is \"nominated.\" That's one nomination.\nRow 1: Also 2013, AVN Award, \"nominated\" again. So that's two.\nRow 2: Nightmoves Award, but the result here is \"won,\" not nominated. So I don't count this.\nRow 3: Nightmoves Award, \"nominated.\" That brings it to three.\nRow 4: XBiz Award, \"nominated.\" Now we're at four.\n\nWait, that's only four nominations. The claim says five. Hmm, did I miss a row? Let me check again.\n\nRows 0-4 are the total data provided. Rows 0 and 1 are AVN nominations, row 3 is Nightmoves nomination, and row 4 is XBiz nomination. That makes four in total. So why does the claim say five?\n\nMaybe there's something I'm missing. Let me look at each cell again to ensure I didn't overlook any other nominations.\n\nRow 0: Yes, nominated.\nRow 1: Nominated.\nRow 2: Won, so not a nomination.\nRow 3: Nominated.\nRow 4: Nominated.\n\nTotal is four. Therefore, the claim of five nominations isn't supported by this data. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm miscounting. Let me count again:\n\n1. Row 0: AVN nominated (1)\n2. Row 1: AVN nominated (2)\n3. Row 3: Nightmoves nominated (3)\n4. Row 4: XBiz nominated (4)\n\nYep, only four. So the claim is over by one. Therefore, it's false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states Brandi Love was nominated for five awards in 2013.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"big titty milfs be the only name work brandi love receive an award nomination for in 2013.\" Hmm, first, let me break this down.\n\nThe main points are:\n1. Brandi Love received an award nomination in 2013.\n2. The only nominated work was \"big titty milfs.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different nomination or award result for Brandi Love in 2013. Let me check each row to see what the work was.\n\nRow 0: The work is listed as \"n/a.\" So that's not relevant.\nRow 1: Work is \"big titty milfs,\" and she was nominated for the AVN Award in this category. That fits the claim.\nRows 2,3,4: All have \"n/a\" under work, so no specific titles there.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says that \"big titty mujeres\" (I think that's a typo and should be \"mujeres,\" which means women in Spanish) is the only nomination. But looking at row 1, it's specifically about a sex scene with Kelly Madison, under the AVN Award for \"most outrageous sex scene.\" So the work here is part of a movie titled \"big titty milfs.\"\n\nBut are there other nominations where the work isn't listed as \"n/a\"? Let me check again. Rows 0 and 1 have actual works mentioned. Wait no, row 0 has \"n/a,\" but row 1 has \"big titty mujeres.\" The other rows don't specify a work.\n\nWait, so if row 1 is the only one with a specific work title, then the claim that it's the only nomination would be TRUE? But wait, looking again at the data:\n\nRow indices are from 0 to 4. Let me list them out:\n\n- Row 0: AVN Award, nominated for MILF/Cougar performer of the year, work is \"n/a.\" So no specific movie.\n- Row 1: AVN Award, nominated for Most Outrageous Sex Scene with Kelly Madison, work is \"big titty mujeres.\"\n- Rows 2 and 3 are Nightmoves awards: won for Best Cougar MILF (Editor's Choice) and nominated for Best Ass. Both have \"n/a\" under work.\n- Row 4: XBIZ Award, nominated for Web Star of the Year, work is \"n/a.\"\n\nSo in terms of specific works mentioned, only row 1 has a work title. The others don't specify any particular work beyond the award category.\n\nTherefore, if the claim says that \"big titty mujeres\" was her only nomination, then it's TRUE because all other nominations either didn't have a specified work or had different categories without a specific work title linked to them.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. The claim might be implying that the work itself is the only one she received a nomination for. So in row 1, the award is for the sex scene within \"big titty mujeres,\" so that's one nomination. But are there any other works she was nominated for? From the data, it seems not.\n\nSo yes, the claim would be TRUE because \"big titty mujeres\" is the only work listed with a nomination in 2013.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Brandi Love received multiple nominations and one award in 2013. The specific work \"big titty mujeres\" was nominated under the AVN Award for Most Outrageous Sex Scene. Other nominations either didn't specify a work or were in different categories without a specific title linked to them.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"work\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So, the task is to determine whether a claim about Brandi Love winning or not winning an award in 2013 is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"brandi love do not win web star of the year at any award ceremony in 2013\". The key elements here are:\n\n- The person involved: Brandi Love.\n- The specific award: Web Star of the Year.\n- The time frame: Any award ceremony in 2013.\n\nNow, I need to check the table provided. The table has columns: year, ceremony, result, award, work. Let me go through each row and see if any mention Brandi Love winning the \"web star of the year\".\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0:\n- Year: 2013\n- Ceremony: avn award\n- Result: nominated\n- Award: milf / cougar performer of the year\n\nThis doesn't relate to Web Star, so it's not relevant.\n\nRow 1:\n- Year: 2013\n- Ceremony: avn award\n- Result: nominated\n- Award: most outrageous sex scene (with Kelly Madison)\n\nAgain, this is about a different award category. Not relevant.\n\nRow 2:\n- Year: 2013\n- Ceremony: nightmoves award\n- Result: won\n- Award: best cougar / milf performer (editor\u2019s choice)\n\nThis is another award but not Web Star.

The result is 'nominated', not 'won'. So Brandi Love was nominated but didn't win this award in this ceremony.\n\nSo, compiling this information, I see that for the year 2013, there's only one entry related to \"web star of the year\" (Row 4), and the result is 'nominated', not 'won'. There are no entries where Brandi Love won the Web Star award in any ceremony in 2013.\n\nTherefore, the claim that she did not win this award in any ceremony in 2013 is true.

It mentions that Brandi Love won two awards at the AVN Awards in 2013. My goal is to check if this is accurate using the given JSON data.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has five columns: year, ceremony, result, award, and work. The data consists of multiple rows, each representing a nomination or win for different awards. \n\nNow, let's break down the claim into its components:\n1. **Name**: Brandi Love (though her name isn't explicitly mentioned in the table; this might be an assumption)\n2. **Action**: Won 2 awards\n3. **Event**: AVN Award\n4. **Year**: 2013\n\nSince Brandi Love's name doesn't appear in the table, I need to infer based on the data provided.

Rows 0, 1, 3, and 4 are nominations. Therefore, there is only one award won in that year.\n\nThus, the claim isn't supported by the data because she didn't win an award for \"big titty sluts\" and it wasn't her third award.

The task is to determine if the claim \"brandi love be nominate for and win 5 award in 2013\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the data. The table has five columns: year, ceremony, result, award, and work. There are five rows of data from the year 2013.\n\nThe claim mentions two things: Brandi Love was nominated for awards and won five awards in 2013. I'll need to check both aspects\u2014nominations and wins\u2014and count how many there were.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: \n   - Ceremony: AVN Award\n   - Result: Nominated\n   - So, this is a nomination.\n\n2. **Row 1**:\n   - Ceremony: AVN Award\n   - Result: Nominated\n   - Another nomination.\n\n3. **Row 2**:\n   - Ceremony: Nightmoves Award\n   - Result: Won\n   - This is a win.\n\n4. **Row 3**:\n   - Ceremony: Nightmoves Award\n   - Result: Nominated\n   - Another nomination.\n\n5. **Row 4**:\n   - Ceremony: XBIZ Award\n   - Result: Nominated\n   - Yet another nomination.\n\nNow, counting the nominations and wins:\n\n- **Nominations**: Rows 0, 1, 3, and 4 are all nominated. That's four nominations.\n- **Wins**: Only Row 2 shows a win.\n\nThe claim says she was nominated for five awards and won five. However, according to the data, there are only four nominations and one win. \n\nWait a minute\u2014maybe I miscounted? Let me double-check:\n\n- AVN Award: Nominated twice (rows 0 and 1)\n- Nightmoves Award: Won once (row 2) and nominated once (row 3)\n- XBIZ Award: Nominated once (row 4)\n\nSo total nominations are four, not five. And only one win. Therefore, the claim is incorrect on both counts\u2014she was not nominated for five awards nor did she win five.\n\nBut wait, perhaps each award category is considered an individual award? For example, each row represents a separate award she either won or was nominated for. So let's see:\n\n- Row 0: Nominated\n- Row 1: Nominated\n- Row 2: Won\n- Row 3: Nominated\n- Row 4: Nominated\n\nThat's four nominations and one win, totaling five awards. Oh, so she was involved in five award instances: nominated for four and won one. So the total number of awards she participated in (nominations + wins) is five.\n\nWait, but does the claim mean that she was both nominated for five and won five? That doesn't make sense because you can't win more than once if each award is unique. Alternatively, maybe the claim means she was nominated five times and won one of them. But the wording says \"nominated for and win 5 award,\" which could be ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is that she was both nominated for five awards and won all five. That would definitely be false because she only won one. Alternatively, if it means she was nominated five times in total (which she wasn't; she was nominated four times) and won one, then the statement isn't accurate.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The claim is: \"Brandi Love be nominate for and win 5 award in 2013.\" So it's saying she was both nominated for and won five awards. But from the data, she was involved in five award instances: four nominations and one win. She didn't win five; she only won one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"nominated for\" refers to being a nominee (which would be four times) and \"win\" refers to how many she actually won (one). So the total number of awards she was associated with is five, but she only won one. The claim says she both nominated for and won five, which isn't accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a typo and meant she was nominated for five awards in total and won one. But as per the data, she's only nominated four times and won once, making the claim incorrect.\n\nWait, but looking back at the table:\n\n- Year 2013, so all entries are from that year.\n- Each row is a separate award instance.\n\nSo in total, there are five rows. She was nominated in four of them (rows 0,1,3,4) and won one (row 2). So she was involved in five awards: four nominations and one win.\n\nBut the claim says she was both nominated for and won five awards. That would mean she either won all five or perhaps five separate instances where she was both nominated and won each. But that's not possible because you can't win an award you're not nominated for, but you can only win some of them.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is that she was nominated for five awards (which isn't true; it's four) and won five, which also isn't true. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is that in 2013, she was nominated for five awards and won five, but she only won one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"nominated for\" refers to being a nominee, regardless of whether she won or not. So total nominations would be four (rows 0,1,3,4) plus the win in row 2 is also a nomination. Wait, no\u2014row 2's result is \"won,\" so it's separate.\n\nWait, actually, each award instance can have multiple nominees, but only one winner. So for each row where she was nominated (four times), she might have been among several nominees, and in one case, she won.\n\nSo total nominations: four, wins: one. The claim says she was nominated for five awards and won five, which is incorrect because she was only involved in five award instances but only won one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the count is considering each row as a separate award. So there are five award categories she participated in, either by nomination or win. But that doesn't align with the claim's wording, which seems to suggest both being nominated and winning five each.\n\nI think I need to clarify: the claim says \"be nominate for and win 5 award.\" This could be interpreted as she was nominated for five awards and won all five. However, from the data, she was only nominated four times (rows 0,1,3,4) and won once (row 2). So she didn't win five; she only won one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"nominated for\" refers to being a nominee in five different award categories, but looking at the 'award' column:\n\n- Milf / Cougar Performer of the Year\n- Most Outrageous Sex Scene (with Kelly Madison)\n- Best Cougar / MILF Performer (Editor\u2019s Choice)\n- Best Ass\n- Web Star of the Year\n\nThese are five distinct awards. So she was nominated for four and won one. Therefore, she was involved in five awards: four as a nominee and one as a winner.\n\nBut the claim says \"nominated for and win 5 award,\" which could mean that she was both nominated for and won each of the five awards, which isn't true because she only won one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is that she was nominated for five awards in total (which would be accurate if we count row 2 as a nomination plus a win) but that's not how it works\u2014row 2 is a win, not just a nomination. So she was nominated four times and won once, making five award instances.\n\nBut the wording of the claim is unclear. It says \"be nominate for and win 5 award.\" If it means she was both nominated for five awards and won five, that's incorrect because she only won one. Alternatively, if it means she was involved in five awards (four nominations, one win), then maybe it's accurate.\n\nBut the exact wording is: \"You are tasked with verifying whether Brandi Love was nominated for and won 5 awards in 2013 based on the provided data.\"\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the initial problem statement: The user says, \"You are tasked with verifying whether Brandi Love was nominated for and won 5 awards in 2013 based on the provided data.\" So the task is to verify if she was both nominated for five awards and won those five. Or does it mean that she was nominated for five and won each of them?\n\nIn any case, from the data:\n\n- Nominated four times: rows 0,1,3,4\n- Won once: row 2\n\nSo she wasn't nominated for five awards; she was only nominated for four. She also didn't win five awards; she won one.\n\nTherefore, the claim that she was both nominated for and won five awards is false based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\nBased on the provided data, Brandi Love was nominated for four awards and won one award in 2013. Therefore, she was not nominated for and did not win five awards in that year.\n\n**Answer:** No, Brandi Love was not nominated for and did not win five awards in 2013; she was nominated for four and won one.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"brandi love be the winner of the web star of the year award at the xbiz award ceremony in 2013.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the key components of the claim:\n\n1. **Person**: brandi love\n2. **Award Category**: web star of the year\n3. **Event/Ceremony**: xbiz award\n4. **Year**: 2013\n5. **Result**: winner\n\nNow, I'll examine each relevant part in the table.\n\nLooking at the columns: \"year\", \"ceremony\", \"result\", \"award\", \"work\".\n\nI need to find rows where:\n- year is 2013\n- ceremony is xbiz award\n- award is web star of the year\n- result is won\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0:\n- year: 2013 \u2705\n- ceremony: avn award \u274c (not xbiz)\nSo, irrelevant.\n\nRow 1:\n- year: 2013 \u2705\n- ceremony: avn award \u274c\nAgain, not relevant.\n\nRow 2:\n- year: 2013 \u2705\n- ceremony: nightmoves award \u274c\nNot relevant either.\n\nRow 3:\n- year: 2013 \u2705\n- ceremony: nightmoves award \u274c\nStill not matching xbiz.\n\nRow 4:\n- year: 2013 \u2705\n- ceremony: xbiz award \u2705\n- award: web star of the year \u2705\n- result: nominated \u274c (not won)\n\nSo, in row 4, the ceremony is correct, the award matches, but the result was a nomination, not a win. Therefore, brandi love was nominated, not the winner for that award at the xbiz ceremony in 2013.\n\nSince the claim states she \"be the winner,\" and according to the table, it's only a nomination, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies that Brandi Love won the web star of the year award.
