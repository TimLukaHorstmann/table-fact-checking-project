    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the game against opponent buffalo sabre have an attendance of 10750\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the table contains. The columns are: game, date, opponent, score, location, attendance, record, points. Each row represents a specific game with details filled in these columns.\n\nThe claim mentions two pieces of information: the opponent is \"buffalo sabre\" and the attendance is 10750. My task is to check if there's a row where both these conditions are met.\n\nLooking through the data, I'll scan each row for the opponent being \"buffalo sabres.\" Let me go step by step.\n\nRow indices start at 0:\n\n- Row 2: Opponent is Atlanta Thrashers.\n- Row 3: Phoenix Coyotes.\n- Row 4: Anaheim Ducks.\n- Row 5: Los Angeles Kings.\n- Row 6: San Jose Sharks.\n- Row 7: Philadelphia Flyers.\n- Row 8: Florida Panthers.\n- Row 9: Dallas Stars.\n- Row 10: Buffalo Sabres. Here we go.\n\nSo in row 10 (since indices start at 0, this is the 47th game), the opponent is \"buffalo sabres.\" Now I need to check what the attendance was for that game.\n\nLooking at column names, \"attendance\" is one of them. In row 10, under \"attendance,\" the value is 15611. The claim says attendance was 10750. That doesn't match.\n\nWait a minute\u2014did I miss any other rows where opponent is Buffalo Sabres? Let me check again through all data rows.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow indices 0-13 (since there are 14 entries). Only row 10 lists \"buffalo sabres\" as the opponent. So that's the only relevant row.\n\nTherefore, in this row, attendance is 15611, not 10750. Hence, the claim is false because the actual attendance was higher than claimed.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cells are where we found the opponent and the attendance for that specific game.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the game against the Buffalo Sabres had an attendance of 10,750. Checking the table, the only game against Buffalo Sabres (row index 10) shows an attendance of 15,611, which contradicts the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
