    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the claim and check it against the provided table. The claim is: \"muhsin corbbrey have win 2 fight by tko between 2005 and 2009.\"\n\nFirst, I need to identify what exactly we're looking for. The key points are:\n\n1. The fighter's name: Muhsin Corbbrey.\n2. He has two wins (TKO) between the years 2005 and 2009.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it doesn't list the fighter's name directly; instead, each row represents a fight result against an opponent. So I'll need to check for any entries where the method is TKO, the result is a win, and the date falls between 2005 and 2009.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Date 2009-02-28, Result Win, Method Decision. Doesn't match because it's a decision, not TKO.\n- Row 1: 2006-09-15, Win, Method TKO. This is one valid entry.\n- Row 2: 2006-06-15, Loss. Irrelevant since it's a loss.\n- Row 3: 2006-04-21, Win, Method TKO. Second valid entry.\n- Rows 4,5,6,7,8: Methods are Decision (unanimous) or Draw, so they don't count.\n\nSo we found two rows where Muhsin Corbbrey won by TKO within the specified time frame.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"muhsin corbbrey fight 2 fight in florida in 2005\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's about Muhsin Corbbrey having two fights in Florida in the year 2005. So, my task is to check if there are at least two entries in the table where the location was Florida and the date falls within 2005.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a fight with details like date, result, opponent, venue, location, method, round, time, and record. The relevant columns for this claim would be \"date\" and \"location\".\n\nI'll go through each row of data to check for entries in 2005 and locations in Florida.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. The first entry is from 2009-02-28, so that's after 2005. Location is Hilton Head, South Carolina. Not relevant.\n2. Next is 2006-09-15, still not 2005. Location is Mount Pleasant, SC. No match.\n3. The third entry is 2006-06-15, again after 2005. Glen Burnie, Maryland. Doesn't fit.\n4. Fourth row: 2006-04-21, same year as above. Location Mount Pleasant, SC. Not Florida or 2005.\n5. Fifth entry is from 2006-03-09. Opponent is Kareem Robinson in Glen Burnie, MD. No match.\n6. Sixth row: 2006-01-26. Opponent Anthony Abrams in same location as above. Not relevant.\n7. Seventh row: 2005-11-26. Location is Upper Marlboro, Maryland. So it's 2005 but not Florida.\n8. Eighth entry: 2005-04-26. Opponent Emanuel Gonzalez in Miami, Florida. This fits both the year and location.\n9. Ninth row: 2005-04-08. Opponent Ricardo Planter in Port St. Lucie, Florida. Also matches.\n\nSo, I found two entries from 2005 where the location was in Florida: rows 7 (index 6) and 8 (index 7). Therefore, the claim is TRUE because there are indeed two fights in Florida during that year.\n\nI should note which cells were relevant. For each of these rows, I checked the \"date\" to confirm it's 2005 and the \"location\" to ensure it's in Florida. So the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 6: columns date and location\n- Row 7: same columns\n\nSo the answer is TRUE with those two entries.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Muhsin Corbbrey had two fights in Florida in 2005. By examining each row, we find two instances where both the year was 2005 and the location was in Florida.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It claims that Muhsin Corbbrey has never lost a fight in South Carolina. So my task is to check all his fights that took place in South Carolina and see if any of them resulted in a loss.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different fight with various details like date, result, opponent, venue, location, method, round, time, and record. I need to focus on two columns: \"location\" and \"result.\"\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to check where the fights took place and their outcomes.\n\nStarting from the first row (index 0):\n- Location is Hilton Head, South Carolina, USA.\n- The result was a win against Troy Nelson.\n\nSecond row (index 1):\n- Location is Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, USA.\n- The result was a win via TKO in round 4.\n\nThird row (index 2):\n- Location is Glen Burnie, Maryland, USA. Not South Carolina, so I can skip this one since it's not relevant to the claim.\n\nFourth row (index 3):\n- Location is Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, USA.\n- The result was a win via TKO in round 1.\n\nFifth row (index 4):\n- Location is Glen Burnie, Maryland, USA. Again, not South Carolina.\n\nSixth row (index 5):\n- Location is Glen Burnie, Maryland, USA. Still not relevant.\n\nSeventh row (index 6):\n- Location is Upper Marlboro, Maryland, USA. Not South Carolina.\n\nEighth row (index 7):\n- Location is Miami, Florida, USA. Not in South Carolina.\n\nNinth row (index 8):\n- Location is Port St. Lucie, Florida, USA. Also not relevant.\n\nNow, looking at the results in South Carolina:\nRow 0: Win\nRow 1: Win\nRow 3: Win\n\nAll fights in South Carolina resulted in wins for Muhsin Corbbrey.

It says that Muhsin Corbbrey fought in two fights where each lasted more than 5 rounds between the years 2006 and 2009. So I need to look for any entries in the table that match these criteria: fights by Muhsin Corbbrey, occurring between 2006 and 2009, and each fight lasting more than 5 rounds.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns like date, result, opponent, venue, location, method, round, time, and record. The relevant columns here are \"date\" to check the timeframe, \"round\" which indicates how many rounds the fight lasted, and \"result\" or other details if needed.\n\nWait, but looking through the data provided, I don't see any entries mentioning \"muhsin corbbrey.\" All the opponents listed in the \"opponent\" column are names like Troy Nelson, Ryan Rayonec, Tim Coleman, etc. So it seems Muhsin Corbbrey isn't listed as an opponent or participant in these fights.\n\nSince there's no mention of Muhsin Corbbrey in the table at all, I can conclude that there are zero fights by him in this data set between 2006 and 2009. Therefore, he didn't have two fights lasting more than five rounds because he doesn't appear in any of the entries.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false as Muhsin Corbbrey isn't listed in any fight within the specified timeframe.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the claim \"tim coleman have not lose a fight against muhsin corbbrey in 2006\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions Tim Coleman and Muhsin Corbbrey fighting in 2006, specifically that Tim didn't lose that fight. So, my goal is to check if there's a fight between these two in 2006 where Tim lost.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different fight with details like date, result, opponent, etc. I should scan through each entry for any mention of both Tim Coleman and Muhsin Corbbrey in the same row since that would indicate they fought against each other.\n\nStarting from the top, let's go row by row:\n\n1. **Row 0 (2009-02-28):** Opponent is Troy Nelson. Neither Tim nor Muhsin is here.\n2. **Row 1 (2006-09-15):** Opponent is Ryan Rayonec. Not relevant.\n3. **Row 2 (2006-06-15):** Here, the result is a loss against Tim Coleman. Wait, this row shows that someone lost to Tim Coleman. But who is fighting whom? The opponent is Tim Coleman, and the result for the current fighter (Muhsin Corbbrey?) is a loss. Hmm, but I need to confirm if Muhsin Corbbrey is involved here.\n4. **Row 3 (2006-04-21):** Opponent is Shelton Barnes. Not relevant.\n5. **Row 4 (2006-03-09):** Opponent is Kareem Robinson. Not relevant.\n6. **Row 5 (2006-01-26):** Opponent is Anthony Abrams. Not relevant.\n7. **Row 6 (2005-11-26):** Opponent is Ben Lock. Not relevant.\n8. **Row 7 (2005-04-26):** Opponent is Emanuel Gonzalez. Not relevant.\n9. **Row 8 (2005-04-08):** Opponent is Ricardo Planter. Not relevant.\n\nWait, in row 2, the opponent is Tim Coleman, and the result is a loss. So, the fighter who fought against Tim Coleman lost that fight. But does this involve Muhsin Corbbrey? The table doesn't mention Muhsin Corbbrey anywhere except possibly in the description of the opponent or other fields.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me look again at row 2:\n\n- Date: 2006-06-15\n- Result: loss\n- Opponent: Tim Coleman\n- Venue and location details...\n\nSo, this indicates that the fighter in question (Muhsin Corbbrey?) lost to Tim Coleman on that date. The result is 'loss', which means Muhsin lost against Tim.\n\nWait a second, but the claim says \"Tim Coleman have not lose a fight against muhsin corbbrey in 2006.\" So according to this, if Tim Coleman won against Muhsin Corbbrey in 2006, then the claim is that Tim didn't lose, which would be true because he actually won.\n\nBut wait, the table doesn't explicitly mention Muhsin Corbbrey. The opponent in row 2 is Tim Coleman, but who is the fighter? Is it Muhsin?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The table lists fights where the opponent is someone else. So, if the current fighter (Muhsin) fought against Tim Coleman on that date and lost, then yes, Tim won against him.\n\nBut in row 2, the 'result' is a loss for our fighter (probably Muhsin). So, according to this, Tim Coleman beat Muhsin Corbbrey in 2006. Therefore, Tim did not lose that fight; he won. Hence, the claim \"Tim Coleman have not lose...\" would be TRUE.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that this row indeed refers to a fight between Tim and Muhsin. Since the opponent is Tim Coleman, it means our fighter (Muhsin) fought against him. So yes, in 2006, Muhsin lost to Tim, so Tim didn't lose; hence, the claim is TRUE.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the table doesn't explicitly mention Muhsin Corbbrey except as the opponent? Or wait, perhaps the table is from Muhsin's perspective. So each row is about his fights. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the columns: date, result, opponent, venue, location.\n\nSo, if this is Muhsin's fight history, then in row 2, he fought against Tim Coleman on 2006-06-15 and lost. So Tim won against him. Therefore, Tim did not lose that fight, which makes the claim TRUE.\n\nAlternatively, if the table was from someone else's perspective, but given the context, it's likely Muhsin's fights. Therefore, the relevant cell is row 2 where he fought Tim Coleman and lost in 2006.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So Tim Coleman didn't fight Ben Lock in 2006.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there's no record of a loss against Ben Lock by Tim Coleman in that year.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table data. The claim says: \"muhsin corbbrey fight in 4 fight that last more than 5 round between 2006 and 2009.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It's talking about Muhsin Corbbrey having four fights between the years 2006 and 2009, and each of those fights lasted more than five rounds.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight with details like date, result, opponent, venue, location, method, round, time, and record. The relevant columns here are \"date\" to check the year, and \"round\" to see how many rounds each fight went for.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Date is 2009-02-28 (within 2006-2009). The round number is 6. Since 6 > 5, this counts.\n2. **Row 1**: Date is 2006-09-15. Round is 4. 4 is not more than 5, so it doesn't count.\n3. **Row 2**: Date is 2006-06-15. Round is 6. Counts as 6 > 5.\n4. **Row 3**: Date is 2006-04-21. Round is 1. Doesn't count.\n5. **Row 4**: Date is 2006-03-09. Round is 4. Doesn't count.\n6. **Row 5**: Date is 2006-01-26. Round is 4. Doesn't count.\n7. **Row 6**: Date is 2005-11-26 (outside the range, since it's before 2006). So skip this row.\n8. **Row 7**: Date is 2005-04-26 (also outside the range).\n9. **Row 8**: Date is 2005-04-08 (again, outside).\n\nNow, counting how many fights meet the criteria of being between 2006 and 2009 and having rounds >5:\n\nFrom above:\n- Row 0: Counts\n- Row 1: Doesn't count\n- Row 2: Counts\n\nSo only two fights meet the conditions. The claim says there are four such fights, but according to this table, it's only two. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are the ones in the \"date\" and \"round\" columns for each row within the specified date range. Specifically:\n- Row 0: date (2009-02-28) and round (6)\n- Row 1: date (2006-09-15) and round (4)\n- Row 2: date (2006-06-15) and round (6)\n- Rows beyond that are either outside the date range or have rounds less than or equal to 5.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are rows 0, 1, and 2 for both \"date\" and \"round\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because only two fights met the criteria of lasting more than five rounds between 2006 and 2009, not four. The relevant cells include the date and round columns from each applicable row.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
