    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim \"the 2005 drama desk award for outstanding choreography do not go to william ivey long\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table structure. It has columns: year, award, category, nominee, result. The data consists of seven rows, each representing a different nomination or win from 2005.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions the \"drama desk award\" for \"outstanding choreography\" in 2005 and whether William Ivey Long was awarded it. So, I need to look for rows where:\n- Year is 2005\n- Award is \"drama desk award\"\n- Category is \"outstanding choreography\"\n\nLooking through the data:\n\nRow 4: Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival of a Musical \u2013 Not relevant.\nRow 5: Drama Desk Award, category is outstanding choreography. The nominee here is Jerry Mitchell, who won. So William Ivey Long isn't listed here as a nominee.\nRow 6: Also Drama Desk, but for costume design. Not relevant.\n\nSo, the only row that matches all criteria is Row 5. In this row, the nominee was Jerry Mitchell, not William Ivey Long. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because William Ivey Long did not receive the award; it went to someone else.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true as William Ivey Long wasn't the recipient for outstanding choreography.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 5,\n       \"column_name\": \"nominee\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"nominee for best costume design in 2005 at the tony award be qilliam ivey long.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim. It's talking about a nominee in 2005 for the Tony Award in the category of Best Costume Design, and the person is William Ivey Long.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: year, award, category, nominee, result. The data rows go from index 0 to 6. \n\nI need to find all entries that match the criteria:\n- Year must be 2005.\n- Award must be \"tony award\".\n- Category should be \"best costume design\".\n\nOnce I have those, I'll check who the nominee was and see if it's William Ivey Long.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Year is 2005, Award is Tony, Category is best revival of a musical. That doesn't match because the category isn't costume design.\n\nRow 1: Tony award, category is best performance by leading actor in a musical. Not relevant.\n\nRow 2: Tony award for best choreography. Still not costume design.\n\nRow 3: Here's one\u2014Tony Award, best costume design. The nominee is William Ivey Long and the result was nominated. So this seems to match part of the claim except that he was nominated, not if he won. But the claim just mentions being a nominee, so that fits.\n\nThen looking at other rows for Tony awards in 2005:\n\nRows 4-6 are Drama Desk Award, so they don't count since we're only focusing on Tony Awards here.\n\nSo row 3 is the relevant one. The claim says \"nominee\" and indeed, William Ivey Long was nominated for best costume design at the Tony Awards in 2005.\n\nWait a second\u2014the exact wording of the claim is: \"nominee for best costume design in 2005 at the tony award be qilliam ivey long.\" There's a typo\u2014\"qilliam\" instead of \"William\". But maybe that was just a typo and they meant William. Also, the table has \"william ivey long\", which is correct.\n\nSo putting it all together: The claim refers to William Ivey Long being a nominee for best costume design at the Tony Awards in 2005, which matches row 3 of the data. Therefore, the claim should be true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly identifies that William Ivey Long was nominated for Best Costume Design at the 2005 Tony Awards. The relevant cell is in row index 3 under the 'nominee' column.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine if the claim \"jerry mitchell be 1 of 2 winner of a tony award\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It states that Jerry Mitchell was one of two winners of a Tony Award in 2005. So, I need to check how many Tony Awards he won and if there were exactly two such awards won by him.\n\nLooking at the table structure: The columns are year, award, category, nominee, and result. Each row represents an entry for a specific award or nomination.\n\nI'll go through each row where the award is \"tony award\" because that's the focus of the claim.\n\nRow 0:\n- Year: 2005\n- Award: Tony Award\n- Category: Best Revival of a Musical\n- Nominee: Best Revival of a Musical (this seems like an award category, not a person)\n- Result: Won\n\nThis row is about the revival category, which doesn't involve Jerry Mitchell. So, I can note that he didn't win this one.\n\nRow 1:\n- Year: 2005\n- Award: Tony Award\n- Category: Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical\n- Nominee: Gary Beach\n- Result: Nominated\n\nJerry isn't the nominee here; it's Gary. So, no relevance to Jerry.\n\nRow 2:\n- Year: 2005\n- Award: Tony Award\n- Category: Best Choreography\n- Nominee: Jerry Mitchell\n- Result: Won\n\nHere, Jerry won a Tony Award for Best Choreography. That's one win.\n\nRow 3:\n- Year: 2005\n- Award: Tony Award\n- Category: Best Costume Design\n- Nominee: William Ivey Long\n- Result: Nominated\n\nJerry isn't involved here; he didn't get this award or nomination.\n\nNext, there are rows about the Drama Desk Awards. Since the claim is specifically about the Tony Awards, I can ignore these rows as they pertain to a different award category.\n\nNow, compiling the relevant information:\n- Jerry Mitchell won one Tony Award in 2005 (Best Choreography).\n- There's no other row where he won another Tony Award.\n\nThe claim says he was \"1 of 2 winner\" which implies there were two winners and Jerry was one of them. However, according to the table, he only has one win. Therefore, the claim is not fully supported because it states that he was one among two winners, but in reality, he's the sole winner of a Tony Award based on this data.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Maybe \"1 of 2\" refers to two awards, and Jerry won both? But looking again, there are multiple categories, but for Tony Awards, only Best Choreography was won by Jerry. The other award under Tony in the same year (Best Revival) seems to be a category name rather than an individual, so it's unclear who else won besides Jerry. However, from the table, only Jerry Mitchell is listed as a winner of a Tony Award. Therefore, he wasn't one of two winners; he was the sole winner.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"1 of 2\" refers to being one among two nominees? But the claim specifies \"winner,\" so it's about winning, not nomination. Since he only won once, and no other winners are listed for Tony Awards except possibly in categories without individual names (like Best Revival), which doesn't list a person, I think the table shows only Jerry as a winner.\n\nTherefore, the claim that he was one of two winners is incorrect because he was the sole winner according to the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Jerry Mitchell was one of two Tony Award winners in 2005. Upon reviewing the table, it's evident that Jerry Mitchell won one Tony Award for Best Choreography. However, there's no other individual listed as a Tony Award winner in this dataset except possibly in categories without specific nominees (like Best Revival), which doesn't involve Jerry. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim is: \"jerry mitchell be 1 of 3 nominee for a drama desk award\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this means. It says that Jerry Mitchell was one among three nominees for a Drama Desk Award. So, I should check how many nominations there were under the Drama Desk Award and see if Jerry Mitchell is listed as one of them.\n\nLooking at the table, it has columns: year, award, category, nominee, result. The data includes entries from 2005 Tony Awards and Drama Desk Awards.\n\nI'll go through each row in the data to find relevant information about the Drama Desk Awards.\n\nRow 4: [\"2005\", \"drama desk award\", \"outstanding revival of a musical\", \"outstanding revival of a musical\", \"won\"]\n- This is an award, but the nominee isn't a person here; it's the category name. So, not relevant for our claim about Jerry Mitchell.\n\nRow 5: [\"2005\", \"drama desk award\", \"outstanding choreography\", \"jerry mitchell\", \"won\"]\n- Here, Jerry Mitchell is listed as the nominee in the outstanding choreography category and he won.\n\nRow 6: [\"2005\", \"drama desk award\", \"outstanding costume design\", \"william ivey long\", \"nominated\"]\n- This is another Drama Desk Award nomination for William Ivey Long, but not Jerry Mitchell.\n\nSo from this table, in the Drama Desk Awards, there are only two entries where nominees are individuals: Row 5 (Jerry Mitchell) and Row 6 (William Ivey Long). That makes a total of two nominations. \n\nWait, actually, let me count all Drama Desk Award rows:\n\n- Row 4 is about \"outstanding revival of a musical\", but the nominee isn't an individual.\n- Row 5: Jerry Mitchell, won\n- Row 6: William Ivey Long, nominated\n\nSo in terms of individual nominees for Drama Desk Awards, there are two people: Jerry and William. Therefore, the claim that Jerry was one of three nominees is incorrect because there are only two individual nominees listed.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should check if \"outstanding revival of a musical\" had other nominees not listed here. The table shows \"outstanding revival of a musical\" with the same name as the category and result 'won'. Maybe that means it's an award given to a production, so not an individual nominee. So in terms of individual nominees for Drama Desk Awards, there are two: Jerry Mitchell (choreography) and William Ivey Long (costume design). \n\nTherefore, the claim says 3 nominees, but according to this table, only two individuals were nominated (Jerry and William). Hence, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait again. Let me think about it differently. The table might not list all the nominees; maybe there are more in reality. However, based solely on the information given, the Drama Desk Awards have three entries:\n\n1. Outstanding revival of a musical: won by the same category name.\n2. Outstanding choreography: Jerry Mitchell, won\n3. Outstanding costume design: William Ivey Long, nominated\n\nBut if we're considering only individual nominees, that's two people. So the claim says Jerry was one of 3 nominees, but according to this table, he is one of two. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait another thing: perhaps \"nominated\" and \"won\" both count as nominees. In the Tony Awards section:\n\nRow 1: Gary Beach, nominated\nRow 2: Jerry Mitchell, won (Tony for choreography)\nRow 3: William Ivey Long, nominated\n\nBut that's under Tony Awards, not Drama Desk. So in the Drama Desk section, the relevant rows are 4-6.\n\nSo in the Drama Desk Award category:\n\n- Row 5: Jerry Mitchell (won) - so he was a nominee\n- Row 6: William Ivey Long (nominated)\n\nSo that's two individual nominees for Drama Desk Awards. Therefore, the claim says 3 nominees, but according to this table, there are only two. Hence, the claim is false.\n\nWait, perhaps \"outstanding revival of a musical\" had multiple nominees? The table shows only one entry with the same name as the category and result 'won'. So maybe that was the only nomination in that category. Therefore, total individual Drama Desk nominees would be two: Jerry Mitchell (choreography) and William Ivey Long (costume design). \n\nSo the claim is false because there are not three nominees but two.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Jerry Mitchell was one of three nominees for a Drama Desk Award. Examining the table, under the Drama Desk Awards, only two individual nominees are listed: Jerry Mitchell and William Ivey Long. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It states that Gary Beach was one out of four nominees for a Tony Award in some category. So, my task is to check if there are exactly four nominees listed under the \"nominee\" column where the \"award\" is \"tony award\".\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n- The columns are year, award, category, nominee, and result.\n- Each row represents a specific nomination or win.\n\nI'll go through each row in the data array to find all entries that match \"tony award\" under the award column and check their results.\n\nRow 0: \n- Award is \"tony award\", category is \"best revival of a musical\". The nominee is listed as \"best revival of a musical\" and result is \"won\". Wait, this seems odd because the nominee should be a person or work, not the same as the category. Maybe it's a typo or misunderstanding in the data.\n\nRow 1:\n- Award is \"tony award\", category is \"best performance by a leading actor in a musical\". Nominee is Gary Beach, result is \"nominated\".\n\nRow 2:\n- Award is \"tony award\", category is \"best choreography\". Nominee is Jerry Mitchell, result is \"won\".\n\nRow 3:\n- Award is \"tony award\", category is \"best costume design\". Nominee is William Ivey Long, result is \"nominated\".\n\nRows 4-6 are Drama Desk Awards, so we can ignore those.\n\nNow, counting the number of nominees for Tony Awards. Let's see:\n\nRow 0: nominee is same as category, which might be incorrect but let's count it as a nomination since result is \"won\". So that's one.\n\nRow 1: Gary Beach nominated. That's two.\n\nRow 2: Jerry Mitchell won. That's three.\n\nRow 3: William Ivey Long nominated. That's four.\n\nSo, there are four nominees for Tony Awards in this table. Among them, Gary Beach is one of the nominees (row 1). Therefore, the claim that he was 1 of 4 nominees holds true.\n\nThe relevant cells would be row indices 0,1,2,3 under the \"nominee\" column because they show all the nominees for Tony Awards, confirming that there are four. However, since the claim specifically mentions Gary Beach being one of them, we can also include his specific cell (row 1) as a key point.\n\nWait, but the instructions say to list each relevant cell, so perhaps I should include all rows related to Tony Award nominees and their results. That includes row 0,1,2,3 under \"nominee\" column because together they show there are four nominees in total for Tony Awards, supporting the claim that Gary Beach is one among them.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Gary Beach was one of four nominees for a Tony Award. By examining rows 0-3 where the award is 'tony award', we find four nominees: 'best revival of a musical', Gary Beach, Jerry Mitchell, and William Ivey Long.

Fifth row (index 4): Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival of a Musical, nominee same as category name. Again, not an individual person.\n\n6. Sixth row (index 5): Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography, nominee is Jerry Mitchell, and the result is 'won'. So that's another win, but wait\u2014is this a Tony Award? The award here is \"drama desk award\", so it's a different award. The claim specifically mentions Tony Awards.\n\n7. Seventh row (index 6): Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Costume Design by William Ivey Long, who was nominated. Not relevant to Jerry Mitchell or Tony Awards.\n\nSo from this, the only time Jerry Mitchell won an award in the table is once for Best Choreography at the Tony Awards (row index 2). The other win he has is a Drama Desk Award, which isn't a Tony. Therefore, he only won one Tony Award according to the table, not two.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"jerry mitchell win 2 tony award\" is FALSE because there's only one entry where he won a Tony.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"jerry mitchell be nominate for a drama desk award 3 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. The columns are year, award, category, nominee, and result. Each row represents an entry from the data provided in JSON format.\n\nThe claim mentions Jerry Mitchell being nominated three times for a Drama Desk Award. So I need to look at each row where the award is \"drama desk award\" and see how many times Jerry Mitchell appears as a nominee.\n\nLooking through the data:\n- Row 4: Award is Drama Desk, category Outstanding Choreography, Nominee is Jerry Mitchell, Result is Won.\n- Row 5: Award is Drama Desk, category Outstanding Costume Design, Nominee is William Ivey Long. Wait, not Jerry.\n- Row 6: Award is Drama Desk, category Outstanding Costume Design again, same nominee and result.\n\nWait, so in the Drama Desk Awards, there are three entries:\n1. Outstanding Revival of a Musical, which was won by \"outstanding revival of a musical\" (which seems like the award itself, not a person).\n2. Outstanding Choreography: Jerry Mitchell, Won.\n3. Outstanding Costume Design: William Ivey Long, Nominated.\n\nWait no, looking back:\n\nRows 4,5,6 are Drama Desk Awards:\n- Row 4: Award is Drama Desk, category Outstanding Revival of a Musical, nominee same as category (maybe that's an award given to the production, not a person), result won.\n- Row 5: Award is Drama Desk, category Outstanding Choreography, nominee Jerry Mitchell, result won.\n- Row 6: Award is Drama Desk, category Outstanding Costume Design, nominee William Ivey Long, result nominated.\n\nSo in terms of nominations for Drama Desk Awards where the nominee is Jerry Mitchell:\nOnly row 5 mentions him. The other entries either are not about him or don't have his name as a nominee.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all rows:\n\nLooking through each data entry:\n\nRow indices 0-6 correspond to data from 2005 Tony and Drama Desk awards.\n\nLooking for award \"drama desk award\" and nominee \"jerry mitchell\".\n\nIn row 4: Award is Drama Desk, category Outstanding Revival of a Musical. The nominee here is the same as the category, which seems odd\u2014it's probably not a person but the production. So that's not Jerry.\n\nRow 5: Drama Desk, Outstanding Choreography, nominee Jerry Mitchell, result won.\n\nRow 6: Drama Desk, Outstanding Costume Design, nominee William Ivey Long, result nominated.\n\nSo only row 5 has Jerry Mitchell as a nominee for a Drama Desk Award, and it was a win, not just a nomination. So that's one occurrence where he was nominated (and won).\n\nWait the claim says \"be nominate\"\u2014so regardless of whether he won or not, if he was nominated three times.\n\nBut in our data, there is only one instance where Jerry Mitchell was a nominee for a Drama Desk Award. Therefore, the claim that he was nominated three times would be FALSE.\n\nSo the relevant cells are row 5, columns award and nominee.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Jerry Mitchell was nominated three times for a Drama Desk Award. Upon examining the table, only one nomination (and win) is found under the Drama Desk Award category for Jerry Mitchell. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"gary beach be 1 of 4 winner of a tony award\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It seems like Gary Beach was one of four winners of a Tony Award in 2005. So I need to check if Gary Beach won a Tony and then see how many total Tony Awards were given that year according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are year, award, category, nominee, and result. The data has seven rows. Let's go through each row related to the Tony Award.\n\nRow 0: 2005, tony award, best revival of a musical, best revival of a musical, won.\n- So this is about a production winning for best revival. The nominee here is the category name itself, not a person. So no individual winner here except the show or team.\n\nRow 1: 2005, tony award, best performance by a leading actor in a musical, gary beach, nominated.\n- Gary Beach was nominated but didn't win. So he's not a winner here.\n\nRow 2: 2005, tony award, best choreography, jerry mitchell, won.\n- Jerry Mitchell won for choreography.\n\nRow 3: 2005, tony award, best costume design, william ivey long, nominated.\n- William Ivey Long was nominated but didn't win here either.\n\nSo in the Tony Awards section (rows 0 to 3), only two wins are recorded: row 0 and row 2. But wait, row 0's winner is the category name, not a person. So the actual individual winners from the Tony Awards are Jerry Mitchell (row 2) and maybe the show for best revival, but that might be an organizational win rather than an individual.\n\nAdditionally, looking at rows 4-6: Drama Desk awards. Those aren't Tony Awards, so they don't count here.\n\nSo in total, how many Tony Award winners do we have? It seems like only Jerry Mitchell (row 2) is a clear individual winner. The best revival might be considered as another win but it's not an individual person.\n\nThe claim says Gary Beach was one of four winners. But according to the table, he wasn't even a winner; he was nominated. Also, there aren't four Tony Award wins listed for 2005 in this data\u2014only two (row 0 and row 2), but only one individual winner.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Gary Beach didn't win any Tony Award, and there weren't four winners either.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Gary Beach was one of four Tony Award winners. However, according to the table, Gary Beach was only nominated (row 1) and not a winner. There were two wins: one for best revival (row 0) which isn't an individual, and Jerry Mitchell for choreography (row 2). Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
