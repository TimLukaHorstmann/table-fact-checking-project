    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table in JSON format. The claim is: \"arienai kisu be broadcast 7 day after the title with the earliest broadcast date.\"\n\nFirst, I should parse the claim carefully. Let's break it down.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific things:\n1. A title named \"arienai kisu.\"\n2. It was broadcasted 7 days after another title which has the earliest broadcast date in the table.\n\nSo my task is to verify both these points using the data provided.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by identifying the row where the episode's romanized title is \"arienai kisu.\" From the JSON data, let me check each row:\n\n- Row 0: Romanized title is \"omae ga hosii\" \u2192 Not matching.\n- Row 1: Romanized title is \"arienai kisu\" \u2192 This matches the claim.\n\nSo, Episode 2 (row index 1) has the title \"arienai kisu.\" The broadcast date here is May 17, 2010. Now, I need to find out if this was broadcasted exactly 7 days after another episode that has the earliest broadcast date in the table.\n\nNext step: Determine the earliest broadcast date in the table. Let's look at all the broadcast dates:\n\n- Row 0: May 10, 2010\n- Row 1: May 17, 2010\n- Row 2: May 24, 2010\n- Row 3: May 31, 2010\n- Row 4: June 7, 2010\n- Row 5: June 14, 2010\n\nThe earliest date is May 10, 2010. The episode with this date is row index 0.\n\nNow, I need to check if \"arienai kisu\" was broadcasted exactly one week (7 days) after the earliest date.\n\nCalculating the difference between May 17 and May 10: \n\nMay 10 + 7 days = May 17. So yes, it's exactly a week later.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true as per the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because \"arienai kisu\" was broadcast on May 17, which is exactly seven days after the earliest broadcast date of May 10. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"romanized title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"arienai kisu have 3.2% less rating than the title with the earliest broadcast date\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asserting. The claim states that the episode titled \"arienai kisu\" has a rating that is 3.2% lower than the rating of the episode with the earliest broadcast date.\n\nLooking at the table provided in JSON format, I see there are six episodes listed with their respective details. Each row contains information like the episode number, title in Japanese, romanized title, translation, broadcast date, and ratings.\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to identify two specific pieces of information:\n1. The rating of the episode titled \"arienai kisu.\"\n2. The earliest broadcast date among all episodes and the corresponding rating of that episode.\n3. Check if the difference in ratings between these two episodes is exactly 3.2%.\n\nStarting with step one, I'll look through each row to find where the romanized title is \"arienai kisu.\" Scanning the data:\n\n- Episode 1: \"omae ga hosii\" \u2192 Not the target.\n- Episode 2: \"arienai kisu\" \u2192 Yes, this is the episode we're interested in. Its rating is listed as \"19.2%.\"\n\nNext, I need to determine which episode has the earliest broadcast date. The broadcast dates are:\n\n- Episode 1: May 10, 2010\n- Episode 2: May 17, 2010\n- Episode 3: May 24, 2010\n- Episode 4: May 31, 2010\n- Episode 5: June 7, 2010\n- Episode 6: June 14, 2010\n\nThe earliest broadcast date is May 10, 2010, which corresponds to Episode 1. The rating for this episode is \"22.4%.\"\n\nNow, I'll calculate the difference between these two ratings. Episode 2 has a rating of 19.2%, and Episode 1 has 22.4%. \n\nSubtracting Episode 2's rating from Episode 1's gives:\n22.4% - 19.2% = 3.2%.\n\nThis means that \"arienai kisu\" (Episode 2) indeed has a rating that is exactly 3.2% less than the episode with the earliest broadcast date (Episode 1).

The claim states: \"suki to ietara iinoni have the 2nd most recent broadcast date.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The episode in question is titled \"suki to ietara iinoni.\" I'll check the table to find this episode.\n\nLooking at the \"romanized title\" column, I see that ep 5 has the romanized title \"suki to ietara iinoni.\" So, row index 4 corresponds to this episode since the data starts from index 0. The broadcast date for this episode is listed as \"June 7, 2010.\"\n\nNow, I need to determine if this is the second most recent broadcast date in the table. Let's list all the broadcast dates:\n\n- ep 1: May 10, 2010\n- ep 2: May 17, 2010\n- ep 3: May 24, 2010\n- ep 4: May 31, 2010\n- ep 5: June 7, 2010\n- ep 6: June 14, 2010\n\nArranging these dates in order from earliest to latest:\n\nMay 10 < May 17 < May 24 < May 31 < June 7 < June 14.\n\nThe most recent broadcast date is June 14 (ep 6), and the second most recent would be June 7 (ep 5).

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu have 2.2% higher rating than the title with the most recent broadcast date.\"\n\nHmm, so I need to check two things here:\n\n1. Identify which episode has the title \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" and get its rating.\n2. Find out which episode was broadcasted most recently and note its rating.\n3. Compare these two ratings to see if the difference is exactly 2.2%.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by locating the row where the romanized title is \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu.\" Scanning through each data row:\n\n- Ep1: ome ga hosii\n- Ep2: arienai kisu\n- Ep3: fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu (romanized)\n- Ep4: konna ni suki dattanda...\n- Ep5: suki to ietara iinoni\n- Ep6: saish\u016bshoujohomakuwakare\n\nSo, ep3 is the one with \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu.\" Its rating is 15.6% as per the data.\n\nNext, I need to find the episode with the most recent broadcast date. The broadcast dates are:\n\n- Ep1: May 10, 2010\n- Ep2: May 17, 2010\n- Ep3: May 24, 2010\n- Ep4: May 31, 2010\n- Ep5: June 7, 2010\n- Ep6: June 14, 2010\n\nEp6 has the most recent broadcast date on June 14, 2010. Its rating is 13.4%.\n\nNow, let's calculate the difference between ep3 and ep6 ratings:\n\nEp3: 15.6%\nEp6: 13.4%\n\nDifference = 15.6 - 13.4 = 2.2%\n\nWait a minute! That's exactly the figure mentioned in the claim (2.2%). So, according to this calculation, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nBut let me double-check to ensure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes, people confuse which episode is being compared or miscalculate percentages.\n\nEp3: 15.6\nEp6: 13.4\n\nSubtracting 13.4 from 15.6 does indeed give 2.2. So the difference is correct.\n\nAlso, confirming that \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" corresponds to ep3 and the most recent episode is ep6. Yep, looks right.\n\nSo, all conditions in the claim are met as per the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the rating of \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" is 2.2% higher than the episode with the most recent broadcast date. Checking the relevant cells:\n\n- Ep3 (romanized title) has a rating of 15.6%.\n- The most recent episode, ep6, has a rating of 13.4%.\n\nThe difference between these ratings is exactly 2.2%, so the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"suki to ietara iinoni have 4% higher rating than the title with the lowest rating.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. The claim compares the rating of a specific episode titled \"suki to ietara iinoni\" to the episode with the lowest rating. It says that \"suki to...\" has a 4% higher rating than this lowest-rated episode.\n\nLooking at the table, I see six episodes listed. Each row represents an episode with details like the title in different languages and the ratings.\n\nStep 1: Identify the rating of \"suki to ietara iinoni.\"\nI scan through each row's \"translation of title\" column. The fifth row has the translation as \"if only i could say, i like you,\" which corresponds to \"suki to ietara iinoni.\" Its rating is listed in the \"ratings\" column as 17.4%.\n\nStep 2: Find the episode with the lowest rating.\nI need to go through each episode's ratings and find the minimum value.\n\nLooking at all ratings:\n- Episode 1: 22.4%\n- Episode 2: 19.2%\n- Episode 3: 15.6%\n- Episode 4: 15.5%\n- Episode 5: 17.4%\n- Episode 6: 13.4%\n\nThe lowest rating is 13.4% in episode 6.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the difference between \"suki to...\" and the lowest-rated episode.\nThe claim states that \"suki to...\" has a 4% higher rating than the lowest.

My task is to determine the answer based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim again: \"arienai kisu be broadcast 14 day after the title with the earliest broadcast date.\" So, the claim states that the episode titled \"arienai kisu\" was broadcasted 14 days after another episode which had the earliest broadcast date. \n\nLooking at the table, there are six episodes listed. The columns include \"episode title\", \"romanized title\", \"translation of title\", and \"broadcast date\". Each row corresponds to an episode with its details.\n\nI need to identify two key pieces of information: \n1. Which episode has the earliest broadcast date?\n2. What is the broadcast date of \"arienai kisu\" (episode 2)?\n\nStarting with the first point, I'll list out all the broadcast dates:\n- Episode 1: May 10, 2010\n- Episode 2: May 17, 2010\n- Episode 3: May 24, 2010\n- Episode 4: May 31, 2010\n- Episode 5: June 7, 2010\n- Episode 6: June 14, 2010\n\nFrom this list, it's clear that the earliest broadcast date is May 10, 2010, which corresponds to \"omae ga hosii\" (episode 1). \n\nNext, I check when \"arienai kisu\" was broadcast. Looking at episode 2, its broadcast date is May 17, 2010. Now, the claim says that this episode was broadcasted 14 days after the earliest one. Let's calculate the difference between May 10 and May 17.\n\nMay 10 to May 17 is exactly 7 days apart (since May 10 is day 1, adding 7 days brings us to May 17). Therefore, \"arienai kisu\" was broadcasted 7 days after the earliest episode, not 14 days as claimed.\n\nSince the claim states it's 14 days later but according to the table it's only 7 days, the claim is FALSE. \n\nTo support this conclusion, I'll note the relevant cells:\n- The earliest broadcast date is in row 0, column \"broadcast date\".\n- Episode 2's broadcast date is in row 1, column \"broadcast date\".\n\nThese two cells are sufficient to verify the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n     {\"row__index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"arienai kisu have 5.8% more rating than the title with the earliest broadcast date\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: Unnamed: 0 (which seems to be episode numbers), episode title, romanized title, translation of title, broadcast date, and ratings. There are six rows, each representing an episode from ep1 to ep6.\n\nThe claim mentions two main points:\n1. \"arienai kisu\" which I assume refers to the episode with that romanized title.\n2. The rating comparison: it's said to have 5.8% more than the earliest broadcasted episode.\n\nSo, first step is to identify which row corresponds to \"arienai kisu\". Looking at the data, in row 1 (since rows start from 0), the romanized title is \"arienai kisu\" and the ratings are 19.2%. So that's ep2.\n\nNext, I need to find the episode with the earliest broadcast date. The broadcast dates for each episode are as follows:\n- ep1: May 10, 2010\n- ep2: May 17, 2010\n- ep3: May 24, 2010\n- ep4: May 31, 2010\n- ep5: June 7, 2010\n- ep6: June 14, 2010\n\nThe earliest date is May 10, 2010, which is ep1. The rating for ep1 is 22.4%.\n\nNow, the claim says that \"arienai kisu\" (ep2) has a 5.8% higher rating than the earliest episode. Let's calculate the difference between ep2 and ep1.\n\nEp2 rating: 19.2%\nEp1 rating: 22.4%\n\nDifference = 19.2 - 22.4 = -3.2%. This means that ep2 has a lower rating than ep1, specifically by 3.2 percentage points, not higher.\n\nWait, but the claim states it's 5.8% more. That would mean if we added 5.8% to ep1's rating, but let me think again: perhaps the difference is being calculated incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is considering relative increase rather than absolute. Let's check that as well.\n\nEp2 is 19.2%. To find out what percentage higher it is compared to ep1:\n\nBut since ep2 is actually lower, it can't be higher by any positive percentage. So regardless of whether it's absolute or relative, the claim doesn't hold because ep2 has a lower rating than ep1.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps I misunderstood which episode has the earliest date? Let me double-check the broadcast dates:\n\nep1: May 10\nep2: May 17\nYes, so ep1 is indeed the earliest. Therefore, the claim that \"arienai kisu\" (ep2) has a higher rating than ep1 is incorrect because its rating is lower by 3.2%.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"arienai kisu\" has a 5.8% higher rating than the earliest episode. However, checking the ratings: \"arienai kisu\" (ep2) has 19.2%, while ep1 has 22.4%.

The show in question is \"Fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu,\" which is listed under the \"romanized title\" column. So I should look for that entry in the table.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\n- Row 0: Episode 1, romanized title \"omae ga hosii\"\n- Row 1: Episode 2, romanized title \"arienai kisu\"\n- Row 2: Episode 3, romanized title \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" (I recognize the Japanese characters for this one)\n- Row 3: Episode 4, romanized title \"konna ni suki dattanda...\"\n- Row 4: Episode 5, romanized title \"suki to ietara iinoni\"\n- Row 5: Episode 6, romanized title \"saish\u016bsh\u014djomakuwakare\"\n\nSo, the episode in question is at row index 2.\n\nNext, I need to check its broadcast date. The column for that is \"broadcast date.\" Let's look at each episode's broadcast date:\n\n- Ep1: May 10, 2010\n- Ep2: May 17, 2010\n- Ep3: May 24, 2010\n- Ep4: May 31, 2010\n- Ep5: June 7, 2010\n- Ep6: June 14, 2010\n\nThe broadcast dates are in chronological order from earliest to latest. The most recent date would be the latest one, which is June 14, 2010 (Ep6). The second most recent would be the next earlier date after that.\n\nLooking at Ep5: June 7, 2010, and Ep4: May 31, 2010. Wait, actually, after June 14 comes Ep5 on June 7, then Ep4 on May 31, etc. So the order from most recent to least is:\n\n1. June 14 (Ep6)\n2. June 7 (Ep5)\n3. May 31 (Ep4)\n4. May 24 (Ep3)\n5. May 17 (Ep2)\n6. May 10 (Ep1)\n\nSo, the second most recent broadcast date is June 7, which corresponds to Ep5: \"suki to ietara iinoni.\" \n\nBut the claim is about Ep3 (\"Fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\") having the 2nd most recent date. Wait, that's not correct because Ep3 was on May 24, which isn't second at all. The second most recent is June 7.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells are the broadcast dates of each episode to determine their order and identify which one is actually second.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"Fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" has the 2nd most recent broadcast date. Checking the table, this episode (Ep3) was aired on May 24, 2010. The two most recent episodes are Ep5 (June 7) and Ep6 (June 14). Thus, Ep3 is not in the top two, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu have 3.2% higher rating than the title with the most recent broadcast date.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It mentions two main things:\n\n1. The episode titled \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" has a certain rating.\n2. This rating is 3.2% higher than another episode which was broadcasted most recently.\n\nSo, my task is to verify both parts using the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it's in JSON format with columns: \"Unnamed: 0\", \"episode title\", \"romanized title\", \"translation of title\", \"broadcast date\", and \"ratings\". Each row corresponds to an episode from ep1 to ep6.\n\nFirst step: Identify the row for \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\".\n\nLooking at the \"romanized title\" column, I see:\n\n- ep3 has \"fukusy\\u016b no purop\\u014dzu\", which when decoded is \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\". So row index 2 (since indexing starts at 0) corresponds to this episode.\n\nThe rating for ep3 is 15.6%.\n\nNext, I need to find the episode with the most recent broadcast date. The \"broadcast date\" column shows dates from May 10 to June 14, 2010. The most recent date here is June 14, 2010, which is ep6.\n\nThe rating for ep6 is 13.4%.\n\nNow, the claim says that fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu has a 3.2% higher rating than the most recent episode. Let's check:\n\nEp3: 15.6%\nEp6: 13.4%\n\nThe difference is 15.6 - 13.4 = 2.2%. However, the claim states it's 3.2%, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider if \"most recent\" refers to a different episode? Let me double-check all broadcast dates:\n\n- ep1: May 10\n- ep2: May 17\n- ep3: May 24\n- ep4: May 31\n- ep5: June 7\n- ep6: June 14\n\nYes, ep6 is the most recent. So the difference is only 2.2%, not 3.2%. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\nFor \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" (ep3), we need both its rating and broadcast date to confirm it's ep3, but since the main comparison is about ratings, focusing on the rating cell. But actually, in this case, I think only the rating of ep3 and the rating of the most recent episode are needed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should include all necessary cells:\n\n- For \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\": row 2, \"ratings\" (15.6%)\n- The most recent episode is row 5 (ep6), \"ratings\" (13.4%)\n\nSo the relevant cells are these two.\n\nBut in my initial analysis, I thought about checking if ep3's rating is higher by exactly 3.2%, but since it's only 2.2% higher, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"suki to ietara iinoni have 5.8% higher rating than the title with the lowest rating.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table to understand its structure and data.\n\nThe columns are:\n1. Unnamed: 0\n2. episode title (Japanese)\n3. romanized title\n4. translation of title\n5. broadcast date\n6. ratings\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: ep 1, \"omae ga hosii\", ratings 22.4%\nRow 1: ep 2, \"arienai kisu\", 19.2%\nRow 2: ep 3, \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\", 15.6%\nRow 3: ep 4, \"konna ni suki dattanda...\", 15.5%\nRow 4: ep 5, \"suki to ietara iinoni\", 17.4%\nRow 5: ep 6, \"saish\u016bshoujomakuwakare\", 13.4%\n\nNow, the claim mentions \"suki to ietara iinoni.\" Looking through the table, this is the romanized title in row 4 (index 4). Its rating is 17.4%.\n\nThe next part of the claim refers to the title with the lowest rating. Scanning all ratings:\n\nRow 0: 22.4%\nRow 1: 19.2%\nRow 2: 15.6%\nRow 3: 15.5%\nRow 4: 17.4%\nRow 5: 13.4%\n\nThe lowest rating is 13.4% in row 5 (ep 6). \n\nNow, the claim states that \"suki to ietara iinoni\" has a 5.8% higher rating than this lowest title.\n\nCalculating the difference between their ratings: 17.4% - 13.4% = 4%. The difference is 4%, not 5.8%.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the actual increase is only 4%, which doesn't match the claimed 5.8%.\n\nRelevant cells are:\n- ep 5's rating (row 4, column \"ratings\")\n- ep 6's rating (row 5, column \"ratings\")\n\nThese two cells are necessary to check both ratings for comparison.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"}\n   ]\n}",
