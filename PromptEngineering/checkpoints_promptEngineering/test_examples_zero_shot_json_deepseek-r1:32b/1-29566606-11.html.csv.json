    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"art attack be originally broadcast on citv\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: programme, date(s) of original removal, original channel(s), date of return, new channel(s). So each row represents a different TV show with details about when and where it was removed from broadcast and then returned on another channel or the same.\n\nThe claim is about \"art attack.\" I need to check if this show's original channel was CITV. Let me scan through each row in the data array until I find the one for \"art attack.\"\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 0: celebrity big brother, removed Jan 27, 2010 from Channel 4, returned Aug 18, 2011 on Channel 5.\n\nRow 1: big brother, similar details, also on Channel 4 originally.\n\nRow 2: absolutely fabulous, original channel BBC One. It was removed twice in 96 and 04, then returned in 2011 but stayed on the same channel.\n\nRow 3: art attack, which is our target. The date of original removal is July 13, 2007. The original channels are CITV. So according to this row, \"art attack\" was originally on CITV before being removed and then returned on Disney Junior in June 2011.\n\nSo the claim says that art attack was originally broadcast on CITV. According to the table, that's correct because in the 'original channel(s)' column for art attack, it's listed as CITV.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cell here is row index 3, column \"original channel(s)\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 3,\n       \"column_name\": \"original channel(s)\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine if a claim is true or false based on the given table in JSON format. The claim is \"big brother will return on september 9, 2011\". Let me break down how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are programme, date(s) of original removal, original channel(s), date of return, and new channel(s). There are five rows of data for different programmes.\n\nThe claim is about \"big brother\" returning on a specific date. So I need to find the row where the programme is \"big brother\". Scanning through the data, the second row has \"big brother\" as the programme. \n\nNow, looking at that row: the original removal date was September 10, 2010, from Channel 4. The return date is listed as September 9, 2011, and it moved to Channel 5. So according to this data, \"big brother\" did return on the specified date.\n\nI should check if there are any other rows that mention \"big brother\", but looking at the data, only the second row has that programme name. The first row is for \"celebrity big brother\", which is a different show, so it doesn't affect this claim.\n\nSo, all relevant cells here are in row 1 (since indexing starts at 0). Specifically, I need to check the 'programme' column to confirm it's \"big brother\" and the 'date of return' column for the date. \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the table shows that \"big brother\" returned on September 9, 2011.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"big brother\" will return on September 9, 2011. Checking the table, row index 1 under the programme column confirms it's \"big brother\". The date of return is September 9, 2011, which matches the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"programme\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date of return\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"born to be different will return on august 18 , 2011\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding the structure of the table and what each column represents.\n\nLooking at the JSON data, the columns are:\n1. programme\n2. date(s) of original removal\n3. original channel(s)\n4. date of return\n5. new channel(s)\n\nThe claim is about \"born to be different\" returning on August 18, 2011. I need to check if this specific date matches any entry in the table for that programme.\n\nFirst, I'll search through each row to find where the programme is \"born to be different.\" Scanning through the data array:\n\n- The first row is \"celebrity big brother,\" so not relevant.\n- The second row is \"big brother,\" also not our target.\n- The third row is \"absolutely fabulous,\" nope.\n- The fourth row is \"art attack,\" still not matching.\n- The fifth row is \"born to be different\" \u2014 that's the one.\n\nNow, focusing on this fifth row. I need to check two things: when it was supposed to return and whether any of those dates match August 18, 2011.\n\nLooking at the \"date of return\" column for this row, the date listed is \"9 june 2011.\" The claim states August 18, which doesn't match June 9. So that's a discrepancy.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there are any other dates in the \"date(s) of original removal\" or \"date of return\" columns for this programme that might include August 18. But in this case, \"born to be different\" has multiple original removal dates: \"2004 13 september 2007 5 may 2009,\" but the return date is only listed as June 9, 2011.\n\nSince there's no mention of August 18 in any relevant cell for this programme, the claim isn't supported by the table. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"born to be different\" returns on August 18, 2011. Checking the table, the return date is June 9, 2011.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"programme\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date of return\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
