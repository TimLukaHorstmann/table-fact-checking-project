    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"tarso marque do not complete any lap\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that Tarso Marques did not complete any laps during the race. To verify this, I need to look at the data for Tarso Marques and check how many laps he completed.\n\nLooking at the JSON table structure, there are columns: driver, constructor, laps, time / retired, grid. The \"laps\" column seems relevant here as it indicates the number of laps each driver completed. \n\nNow, I need to find the row corresponding to Tarso Marques in the data array. Scanning through the entries:\n\n1. Damon Hill\n2. Jean Alesi\n3. Michael Schumacher\n4. Mika H\u00e4kkinen\n5. Mika Salo\n6. Olivier Panis\n7. Eddie Irvine\n8. Pedro Diniz\n9. Ukyo Katayama\n10. Pedro Lamy\n11. Luca Badoer\n12. Martin Brundle\n13. Rubens Barrichello\n14. Heinz-Harald Frentzen\n15. David Coulthard\n16. Johnny Herbert\n17. Jacques Villeneuve\n18. Gerhard Berger\n19. Andrea Montermini\n20. Ricardo Rosset\n21. Jos Verstappen\n22. Tarso Marques\n\nWait, actually, looking at the data array indices: the first entry is index 0 (Damon Hill), and the last one is index 21 (Tarso Marques). So, row_index 21 corresponds to Tarso Marques.\n\nNow, checking his laps: according to the table, under the \"laps\" column for Tarso Marques, it's 0. That means he completed zero laps. \n\nThe claim says he did not complete any lap, which aligns with the data since 0 laps mean he didn't finish even a single lap. So the claim is supported by the data.\n\nAdditionally, looking at his \"time / retired\" column, it says \"spun off,\" indicating that he was unable to continue racing, hence completing zero laps.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are in row_index 21 for both \"laps\" and \"driver.\" The driver's name is Tarso Marques, and the laps completed are 0. This confirms the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Tarso Marques did not complete any laps, which is true as per the data showing he completed 0 laps.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"tarso marques start in grid 13 but do not complete any lap\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table data to find the row that corresponds to Tarso Marques. Scanning down the 'driver' column, I see that the last entry is \"tarso marques\". \n\nNext, I check the grid position for this driver. The 'grid' column shows 21 for Tarso Marques. Wait, that's different from what the claim says. The claim states he started in grid 13, but according to the table, his grid position is 21.\n\nThen, looking at the laps completed, I see that the 'laps' value is 0. So, he didn't complete any laps, which aligns with the second part of the claim.\n\nHowever, since the grid number in the table (21) doesn't match the claim (13), the first part of the claim isn't supported by the data. Therefore, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to check are:\n- Grid position for Tarso Marques\n- Laps completed by Tarso Marques\n\nSo, the row index for Tarso Marques is 20 (since rows start at 0). The columns to look at are 'grid' and 'laps'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
