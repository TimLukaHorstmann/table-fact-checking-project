    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim says: \"the royal house be unavailable for the state cao , chen , song , wey , and yan\". So it's claiming that for these five states\u2014cao, chen, song, wey, and yan\u2014the \"royal house\" is not available. That probably means their royal house entries in the table should have a dash or be empty.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has columns: state, type, name, title, royal house. The relevant column here is \"royal house\". I need to check each of these states and see if their \"royal house\" is indeed unavailable (i.e., shows a dash).\n\nLet me go through each state one by one.\n\n1. **Cao**: Looking at the data rows, row 1 has state \"cao\". The royal house column here is \"-\". So that's correct; it's unavailable.\n\n2. **Chen**: Row 2 has state \"chen\", and its royal house is also \"-\". That matches too.\n\n3. **Song**: I need to find a row with state \"song\". Let me scan through the data. Yes, row 13 shows \"song\" as the state, and the royal house is \"-\". So that's unavailable as well.\n\n4. **Wey**: Checking for state \"wey\"\u2014found in row 14. The royal house there is \"-\", which again confirms it's unavailable.\n\n5. **Yan**: Finally, state \"yan\" is in row 15. Its royal house is also \"-\". So that fits the claim as well.\n\nSo all five states mentioned have a \"-\" in their royal house column, meaning their royal houses are indeed unavailable. Therefore, the claim should be true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"li be the name for both the duke of song and the marquis of wey\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me carefully go through each step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are state, type, name, title, royal house. Each row represents a different sovereign with their details.\n\nThe claim has two parts:\n1. \"li\" is the name for the duke of Song.\n2. \"li\" is the name for the marquis of Wey.\n\nI need to check each part against the table data.\n\nStarting with the first part: Duke of Song. I'll look through the rows to find where the state is \"song\". Scanning down, I see row 13: [\"song\", \"sovereign\", \"li\", \"duke\", \"-\"]. Here, the name is \"li\" and the title is \"duke\". So that matches the first part.\n\nNext, the second part: Marquis of Wey. I need to find where the state is \"wey\". Looking through the rows, row 14 is [\"wey\", \"sovereign\", \"li\", \"marquis\", \"-\"]. The name here is also \"li\" and the title is \"marquis\". That matches the second part.\n\nSo both conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I'll note down the relevant cells:\n- For Song: row 13, columns state (to confirm it's song), name (to check if it's li), and title (to ensure it's duke).\nWait, but according to the instructions, I need to identify which cells are relevant to verify the claim. The main points are checking the name and title for each state.\n\nSo for Song: row 13 has \"song\" in state, so maybe that's important, but actually, the key is to check if the name is li when the title is duke for song. Similarly, for Wey, check if the name is li when the title is marquis.\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, I should look at rows where state is 'song' and see if their name is 'li' with the title 'duke'. Similarly for wey.\n\nSo row 13: state song, name li, title duke. So relevant cells would be state (to confirm it's song), name (li), and title (duke). But according to the instructions, I need to list all the relevant cells used to verify each part of the claim.\n\nSimilarly for wey: row 14 has state 'wey', name 'li', title 'marquis'. So again, those three columns are relevant.\n\nBut wait, perhaps only the name and title matter since the claim specifies both roles. The state is given in the claim as song and wey, so I might not need to include the state column if it's already known from the claim. But for thoroughness, maybe including the state confirms that the correct rows are being considered.\n\nBut looking back at the example, they included the columns relevant to the claim. In this case, for each part of the claim, we check the name and title in their respective rows.\n\nSo for Song: row 13 has name 'li' (column \"name\") and title 'duke' (column \"title\"). So those two cells are relevant.\n\nFor Wey: row 14 has name 'li' and title 'marquis', so again, those two columns in that row are relevant.\n\nSo the relevant_cells list should include:\n- For Song: row 13, column \"name\"; row 13, column \"title\".\n- For Wey: row 14, column \"name\"; row 14, column \"title\".\n\nWait, but perhaps the state is also necessary to confirm that it's indeed Song and Wey. So maybe including the state for each of these rows as well.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\nFor Song:\n- row_13, \"state\": confirms it's Song.\n- row_13, \"name\": li.\n- row_13, \"title\": duke.\n\nFor Wey:\n- row_14, \"state\": wey.\n- row_14, \"name\": li.\n- row_14, \"title\": marquis.\n\nBut the user's example only included two cells. Hmm, perhaps in this case, since each condition is about a specific role (duke of Song and marquis of Wey), checking their names suffices once we know which rows correspond to those roles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to include all necessary columns that directly relate to the claim: name for both and title for both. So four cells in total.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The claim is about \"li\" being the name for both roles. So the key is whether the name column has 'li' for those specific titles in their respective states.\n\nSo for each part of the claim:\n\n1. Duke of Song: check if there's a row where state is song, title is duke, and name is li.\n2. Marquis of Wey: check if there's a row where state is wey, title is marquis, and name is li.\n\nThus, for each of these two conditions, the relevant cells are:\n\nFor Song:\n- row 13, \"state\": to confirm it's Song.\n- row 13, \"title\": to confirm it's duke.\n- row 13, \"name\": to check if it's li.\n\nSimilarly for Wey:\n- row 14, \"state\": wey.\n- row 14, \"title\": marquis.\n- row 14, \"name\": li.\n\nBut perhaps the state isn't necessary because the claim specifies which states they're in. So maybe only the name and title are needed for each.\n\nAlternatively, to ensure that we've correctly identified the rows, including the state columns makes sense. Therefore, all six cells might be included, but that's a lot. The user's example in the problem statement included just two cells when checking two conditions, so perhaps here it's four cells: name and title for each of the two relevant rows.\n\nSo to structure:\n\n- Song part: row 13, \"name\" is li; row 13, \"title\" is duke.\n- Wey part: row 14, \"name\" is li; row 14, \"title\" is marquis.\n\nThus, the four cells are relevant.\n\nBut let me look back at the user's example. They included two cells for each of two parts, making four in total. So yes, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"li\" is both the Duke of Song and the Marquis of Wey. To verify this:\n\n1. **For Song**:\n   - Check row 13 where the state is \"song\".\n   - The name column confirms it's \"li\".\n   - The title is \"duke\".\n\n2. **For Wey**:\n   - Check row 14 where the state is \"wey\".\n   - The name column confirms it's \"li\".\n   - The title is \"marquis\".\n\nThus, both conditions are satisfied, making the claim true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row\": 13,\n      \"column\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row\": 13,\n      \"column\": \"title\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row\": 14,\n      \"column\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row\": 14,\n      \"column\": \"title\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"is_claim_true\": true\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It states that Wu is not a duke for Chen and also not a duke for Lu. So, I need to check if there are any entries in the table where the name is \"wu\" and the title is \"duke\" under either the state of Chen or Lu.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has columns: state, type, name, title, royal house. The relevant columns here will be 'state', 'name', and 'title'.\n\nI'll go through each row in the data to find where the name is \"wu\" and see what their titles are under Chen or Lu.\n\nLet's start with row 0:\n- State: cai\n- Name: wu\n- Title: marquis\nThis is for state Cai, so not relevant since we're looking for Chen or Lu. So, this doesn't affect the claim.\n\nNext, let's check all other rows where the name is \"wu\". Looking through the data:\n\nRow 0: wu under cai (already checked)\nRow 8:\n- State: qi\n- Name: wu\n- Title: duke\nSo, this is Wu under Qi as a Duke. Since the claim is about Chen or Lu, this doesn't impact it.\n\nNow, checking for state 'chen':\nLooking through all rows where state is 'chen' (row 2):\n- State: chen\n- Name: you\n- Title: duke\nSo, the name here is You, not Wu. Therefore, there's no entry of Wu being a Duke in Chen.\n\nSimilarly, check for state 'lu':\nRow 7:\n- State: lu\n- Name: shen\n- Title: duke\nAgain, the name is Shen, not Wu. So, there's no entry where Wu is the Duke of Lu.\n\nSince the table doesn't have any entries where \"wu\" is listed as a Duke under either Chen or Lu, the claim that \"wu be not the duke of either chen or lu\" is true.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\n- For Chen (row 2), we check name and title.\n- For Lu (row 7), same thing.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 2, columns 'name' and 'title'\n- Row 7, columns 'name' and 'title'\n\nWait, but according to the instructions, I should list each cell individually.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"the royal house be ji for the state jin, which have both jing and xi\". So, there are two main parts here. \n\n1. The royal house of the state 'jin' is 'ji'.\n2. This state has both individuals named 'jing' and 'xi'.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see that it's a JSON object with columns: \"state\", \"type\", \"name\", \"title\", and \"royal house\". The data is an array of arrays where each inner array represents a row in the table.\n\nI'll start by looking for entries where the state is 'jin'. Scanning through the data:\n\n- Row 5: [\"jin\", \"sovereign\", \"jing\", \"marquis\", \"ji\"]\n- Row 6: [\"jin\", \"sovereign\", \"xi\", \"marquis\", \"ji\"]\n\nSo, there are two rows for state 'jin' with names 'jing' and 'xi'. Both have the royal house as 'ji'.\n\nNow, checking each part of the claim:\n\n1. The royal house is 'ji': For both 'jin' entries, the 'royal house' column indeed shows 'ji'.\n2.

The relevant column here is \"royal house\".\n\nNow, I'll go through each state mentioned in the claim one by one:\n\n1. **Cao**: Looking through the data rows, I find the row where 'state' is 'cao'. It's the second row (index 1). Checking the 'royal house' column for this row shows it has a dash '-', which means no royal house listed.\n\n2. **Chen**: The third row (index 2) has 'chen' as the state.

It says that \"Li\" is not just the name for the Duke of Song and the Marquis of Wey. In other words, there are other individuals with the name Li who hold these titles beyond what might be commonly known or perhaps as per some expectation.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has columns: state, type, name, title, royal house.\n\nI should scan through all rows to find instances where the name is \"Li\" and their corresponding titles.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Name is Wu, not Li.\nRow 1: Name Yi, no.\nRow 2: Name You, no.\nRow 3: Xiong Yan the Elder, no.\nRow 4: Xiong Yong, no.\nRow 5: Jing, no.\nRow 6: Xi, no.\nRow 7: Shen, no.\nRow 8: Wu again, no.\nRow 9: Marquis, but name is \"marquis\", not Li.\nWait, that's a bit confusing. In row 9, the name field has \"Marquis\". That might be an error or perhaps a title used as a name? Not sure yet.\n\nContinuing:\nRow 10: Gongbo, no.\nRow 11: Qin Zhong, no.\nRow 12: Li in Song state. Title is Duke.\nRow 13: Li in Wey state. Title is Marquis.\nRow 14: Hui, not Li.\n\nSo, the only entries with name \"Li\" are rows 12 and 13.\n\nNow, let's check their titles:\n- Row 12: Song state, title Duke.\n- Row 13: Wey state, title Marquis.\n\nThe claim states that Li is not the name for only these two. But according to the table, \"Li\" appears exactly in these two rows with those specific titles. There are no other instances of \"Li\" elsewhere. Therefore, the claim that Li is not exclusively their names as Duke and Marquis might be incorrect because there's no evidence of other LIs.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the claim. The claim says \"Li be not the name for only...\" which could mean that Li isn't solely used by those two. But in the table, Li is only used by those two. So if the claim suggests that Li is used elsewhere too, but it's not, then the claim would be false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the titles beyond just 'Duke' and 'Marquis'. Let me check all other rows for any possible instances where name could be Li with different titles or states.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow 12: Song, Duke.\nRow 13: Wey, Marquis.\nNo others. So in this table, Li is only the name for those two positions.

The claim says \"Li be not the name for only the duke of song and the marquis of wey.\" So it's saying Li isn't exclusively their names. But in reality, based on the table, those are the only two LIs.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"wu be the duke of both chen or lu\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for entries where the name is 'wu'. Scanning through the data:\n\n- Row 0: Name is 'wu', state is 'cai', title is 'marquis'.\n- Row 8: Name is 'wu', state is 'qi', title is 'duke'.\n\nSo there are two 'wu's, each in different states. The claim says 'wu' is the duke of both 'chen' or 'lu'. \n\nLooking at their titles:\n- In row 0, under 'title', it's 'marquis' for state 'cai'.\n- In row 8, title is 'duke' for state 'qi'.\n\nNow, checking if any 'wu' has a title as 'duke' in states 'chen' or 'lu'. \n\nLooking at the 'state' column:\n- State 'chen' is in row 2. The name there is 'you', not 'wu'.\n- State 'lu' is in row 7, where the name is 'shen', also not 'wu'.\n\nSo, neither of the 'wu's are dukes of 'chen' or 'lu'. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the table. The answer should be FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to check are:\n- Row 0: columns 'name', 'state', 'title'.\n- Row 8: same columns.\nBut since neither meets the condition, we can list all these cells as relevant for checking the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"state\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"state\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the royal house be not ji for the state jin, which do not have either jing and xi\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into parts. The claim has two main assertions:\n\n1. The royal house of state 'jin' is not 'ji'.\n2. State 'jin' does not have either 'jing' or 'xi'.\n\nI'll check each part against the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see multiple rows where the \"state\" column is \"jin\". Specifically, rows 5 and 6:\n\n- Row 5: state is \"jin\", name is \"jing\", title is \"marquis\", royal house is \"ji\".\n- Row 6: state is \"jin\", name is \"xi\", title is \"marquis\", royal house is \"ji\".\n\nFor the first part of the claim, checking if the royal house is not 'ji' for state 'jin'. Both rows 5 and 6 under 'jin' have 'royal house' as 'ji', so this contradicts the claim. This means the first assertion is false.\n\nThe second part of the claim states that 'jin' does not have either 'jing' or 'xi'. However, in row 5, the name is 'jing' and in row 6, the name is 'xi'. Therefore, both 'jing' and 'xi' are present for state 'jin', which makes this part of the claim false as well.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are incorrect according to the data, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\n- For row 5: columns \"state\", \"royal house\".\n- For row 6: same columns since they pertain to 'jin' and its royal house.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are rows 5 and 6 with column names \"state\" and \"royal house\".\n\nThus, the answer is FALSE, and the relevant cells are these two rows with those specific columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"state\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"state\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
