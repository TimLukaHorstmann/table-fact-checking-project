    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"paul pierce lead the team in point for 5 of the 7 game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the data section to check who led the team in points and count how many times Paul Pierce did so.\n\nLooking at Row 0 (Game 76):\n- \"high points\" column: \"paul pierce 32\"\nSo Paul led here. Count = 1\n\nRow 1 (Game 77):\n- \"high points\": \"paul pierce 21\"\nPaul again leads. Count = 2\n\nRow 2 (Game 78):\n- \"high points\": \"rajon rondo 31\"\nHere, Rajon Rondo led in points. Paul didn't lead this game.\n\nRow 3 (Game 79):\n- \"high points\": \"paul pierce 28\"\nPaul leads again. Count = 3\n\nRow 4 (Game 80):\n- \"high points\": \"paul pierce 14\"\nWait, but the score shows a loss with a low point total. Let me double-check if Paul is the top scorer here.\nYes, it's listed as \"paul pierce 14\". So he led again. Count = 4\n\nRow 5 (Game 81):\n- \"high points\": \"paul pierce 31\"\nPaul leads once more. Count = 5\n\nRow 6 (Game 82):\n- \"high points\": \"glen davis 21\"\nGlen Davis led this game, so Paul didn't.\n\nSo out of 7 games, Paul Pierce led in points for rows 0,1,3,4,5. That's five times. The claim states he led in 5 of 7 games, which matches my count.\n\nNow, I need to collect the relevant cells that support this conclusion. For each game where Paul led, I'll note the row index and the \"high points\" column. \n\nSo relevant cells are:\n- Row 0, high points\n- Row 1, high points\n- Row 3, high points\n- Row 4, high points\n- Row 5, high points\n\nThis confirms that Paul led in five games, so the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Paul Pierce led in points for five out of seven games. The relevant cells are those where he was listed as having the highest points.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"rajon rondo have the most assist for the celtic (12) in 1 game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It states that Rajon Rondo had the highest number of assists (12) for the Celtics in a single game. So I need to check if there's any game where Rondo recorded 12 assists and see if that's indeed the maximum he had in one game.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game played by the Celtics. The columns include \"game\", \"date\", \"team\", \"score\", \"high points\", \"high rebounds\", \"high assists\", \"location attendance\", and \"record\".\n\nI need to focus on the \"high assists\" column for each game because that's where the information about who had the most assists in that particular game is listed. \n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0 (Game 76)**: The high assists are \"rajon rondo 9\". So Rondo had 9 assists here.\n2. **Row 1 (Game 77)**: High assists are \"rajon rondo 6\".\n3. **Row 2 (Game 78)**: It says \"rajon rondo , stephon marbury 5\". Wait, so does that mean both Rondo and Marbury each had 5? Or maybe it's a typo and they split the assists somehow. Not sure, but Rondo here has at most 5.\n4. **Row 3 (Game 79)**: Here, \"rajon rondo 12\" is listed under high assists. So this game he had 12 assists.\n5. **Row 4 (Game 80)**: The opponent was Cleveland and the Celtics lost. High assists are \"rajon rondo 6\".\n6. **Row 5 (Game 81)**: Assists were shared between Tony Allen and Stephon Marbury, each with 5.\n7. **Row 6 (Game 82)**: Stephon Marbury had 8 assists here.\n\nFrom this, the only time Rondo had 12 assists was in Game 79. Now I need to check if that's indeed his highest in any single game listed. Looking back at all rows, yes, 12 is higher than any other assist numbers he has (like 9,6,5).\n\nSo the claim says Rajon Rondo had the most assists for the Celtics with 12 in one game, and from the table, that's accurate. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells that support this conclusion. The key cell is where it shows his 12 assists, which is row index 3 under \"high assists\". So that's the only relevant cell needed for verification.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the table structure. The table has several columns: game number, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, and record. Each row represents a different game played by the Celtics.\n\nThe claim is that the Celtics won all games they played at TD Banknorth Garden. So, I need to look for all games where the location was TD Banknorth Garden and check if they all resulted in wins.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Game 76: Location is TD Banknorth Garden with attendance 18624. The score shows \"w\" which means win. So this game is a win.\n2. Game 77: Also at TD Banknorth Garden, another win.\n3. Game 78: Still the same location, and they won again.\n4. Game 79: Again at TD Banknorth Garden with a win.\n5. Game 80: The location here is Quicken Loans Arena, which isn't TD Banknorth, so I can ignore this one for the claim.\n6. Game 81: Location is Wachovia Center, another away game, so not relevant to our check.\n7. Game 82: Back at TD Banknorth Garden and it's a win.\n\nSo, all games played at TD Banknorth Garden (games 76-79 and 82) resulted in wins. There are no losses for the Celtics at that location based on this data. Therefore, the claim holds true because every game they played there was a win.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as all Celtics' home games at TD Banknorth Garden ended in wins.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the celtic win 6 of their 7 game during this stretch\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, and record. There are 7 rows of data, corresponding to games numbered 76 to 82.\n\nThe claim is about the Celtics winning 6 out of 7 games during this stretch. So I need to check each game's result for wins or losses.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0 (Game 76):** The score column shows \"w 111 - 109 (2ot)\". The 'w' indicates a win.\n2. **Row 1 (Game 77):** Score is \"w 104 - 92 (ot)\", another win.\n3. **Row 2 (Game 78):** Score is \"w 106 - 104 (ot)\", so that's a win too.\n4. **Row 3 (Game 79):** \"w 105 - 98 (ot)\" \u2013 another win.\n5. **Row 4 (Game 80):** Here, the score is \"l 76 - 107 (ot)\". The 'l' stands for loss. So this is a loss.\n6. **Row 5 (Game 81):** Score is \"w 100 - 98 (ot)\", which is a win.\n7. **Row 6 (Game 82):** Finally, \"w 115 - 107 (ot)\" \u2013 another win.\n\nNow, counting the wins: Rows 0,1,2,3,5,6 are all wins \u2013 that's six games. Row 4 is a loss. So out of seven games, the Celtics won six and lost one. That matches exactly with the claim.\n\nI should also make sure I'm not missing anything else in the table that might affect this conclusion. The team column shows different opponents each time, but all are within this stretch, so it's consistent. There's no indication of any other games beyond these seven, so the count seems accurate.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells to check are the 'score' column across all rows because each score tells us whether they won or lost each game. This helps in counting the number of wins and losses.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data as the Celtics won six games out of seven during this period.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the highest point total for a celtic player in 1 game be 32, by paul pierce.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It's saying that Paul Pierce scored 32 points in one game, and this is the highest single-game score by a Celtic player.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the relevant column for checking point totals is \"high points\". Each row under this column shows the player(s) with their points in parentheses. \n\nI'll go through each data row:\n\n- Row 0: April 1 vs Charlotte, high points are Paul Pierce (32). This matches the claim.\n- Row 1: April 3 vs Atlanta, Paul Pierce has 21 points, which is less than 32.\n- Row 2: April 8 vs New Jersey, Rajon Rondo scored 31 points. That's close but still less than 32.\n- Row 3: April 10 vs Miami, Paul Pierce again with 28 points.\n- Row 4: April 12 vs Cleveland, Paul Pierce has 14 points.\n- Row 5: April 14 vs Philadelphia, Paul Pierce scores 31 points. Still under 32.\n- Row 6: April 15 vs Washington, Glen Davis with 21 points.\n\nSo, the highest point total in a single game is indeed 32 by Paul Pierce on April 1. There are no other entries that surpass this number. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are in row 0 under \"high points\" and \"game\". The game number isn't necessary for the score, but it's part of the context.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:** The \"high points\" column shows individual player point totals per game.\n2. **Check Each Row:** Review each entry under \"high points\".\n3. **Find Maximum Points:** Paul Pierce's 32 points in row 0 is the highest across all games.\n4. **Verify Player and Score:** Confirmed that it's Paul Pierce with exactly 32 points.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"game\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that Paul Pierce was the leading scorer (in points) for 6 out of 7 games listed in the table. My task is to check each game and see if Paul Pierce had the highest points in those games.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the relevant columns are \"game\", \"date\", \"team\", \"score\", \"high points\", etc. The important column here is \"high points\" since it lists who scored the most in each game along with their points.\n\nThe table has 7 entries (games 76 to 82). I'll go through each one by one:\n\n1. **Game 76 (April 1 vs Charlotte):** The high points are listed as \"paul pierce (32)\". So Paul led here.\n2. **Game 77 (April 3 vs Atlanta):** High points again are \"paul pierce (21)\".\n3. **Game 78 (April 8 vs New Jersey):** Here, it's \"rajon rondo (31)\". Paul didn't lead this one.\n4. **Game 79 (April 10 vs Miami):** High points are \"paul pierce (28)\".\n5. **Game 80 (April 12 vs Cleveland):** Paul led with \"paul pierce (14)\".\n6. **Game 81 (April 14 vs Philadelphia):** He led again with \"paul pierce (31)\".\n7. **Game 82 (April 15 vs Washington):** The high points were by \"glen davis (21)\", so Paul didn't lead here.\n\nNow, counting how many times Paul led: Games 76, 77, 79, 80, 81. That's 5 games. The claim says he led in 6 of the 7 games. Since he only led in 5, the claim is FALSE.\n\nI should also note which rows are relevant for verification.

I need to determine whether the claim \"kendrick perkins have the most assist for the celtic (12) in 1 game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It says that Kendrick Perkins had the most assists with 12 in one game. So, my goal is to check if there's any row in the table where Kendrick Perkins is listed as having 12 assists for the Celtics.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are \"game\", \"date\", \"team\", \"score\", \"high points\", \"high rebounds\", \"high assists\", \"location attendance\", and \"record\". The relevant column here is \"high assists\" since that's where the claim is focused.\n\nI'll go through each row of data to find instances where Kendrick Perkins is mentioned in the \"high assists\" column. \n\n- Row 0: High Assists is Rajon Rondo with 9.\n- Row 1: High Assists is Rajon Rondo with 6.\n- Row 2: High Assists are Rajon Rondo and Stephon Marbury each with 5.\n- Row 3: High Assists is Rajon Rondo with 12. Wait, this is interesting because it mentions Rajon Rondo having 12 assists. But the claim is about Kendrick Perkins.\n- Row 4: High Assists is Rajon Rondo with 6.\n- Row 5: High Assists are Tony Allen and Stephon Marbury each with 5.\n- Row 6: High Assists is Stephon Marbury with 8.\n\nSo, in none of the rows does Kendrick Perkins appear in the \"high assists\" column.

Each row represents a game played by the Celtics.\n\nThe claim mentions that the Celtics lost 6 out of 7 games in this stretch.

    "claim": "the highest point total for a celtic player in 1 game be 32 , by stephon marbury",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the highest point total for a celtic player in 1 game be 32 , by stephon marbury\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the table structure. The columns are: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, record. So each row represents a game with various stats.\n\nThe claim mentions two things: that the highest point total in one game was 32, and that it was scored by Stephon Marbury.\n\nI should look through each row's \"high points\" column to find the maximum points scored by any player in a single game. Let me go through each entry:\n\n- Row 0 (Game 76): High points is Paul Pierce with 32.\n- Row 1 (Game 77): Paul Pierce again, but only 21 points this time.\n- Row 2 (Game 78): Rajon Rondo with 31 points. That's less than 32.\n- Row 3 (Game 79): Paul Pierce scores 28, still lower.\n- Row 4 (Game 80): Paul Pierce has 14, which is way less.\n- Row 5 (Game 81): Paul Pierce again with 31. Close but not higher than 32.\n- Row 6 (Game 82): Glen Davis scores 21 points.\n\nSo the highest point total in a single game from this table is indeed 32, achieved by Paul Pierce in Game 76 on April 1st. \n\nNow, checking who scored that. The claim says it was Stephon Marbury, but according to Row 0 under \"high points\", it's Paul Pierce who scored 32. Stephon Marbury isn't listed there; he appears in other rows for assists and rebounds but not for high points in any row.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because while the highest point total is 32, it wasn't scored by Stephon Marbury but by Paul Pierce.\n</think>\n\nThe highest point total of 32 was achieved by Paul Pierce, not Stephon Marbury. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:** The \"high points\" column contains the player with the highest points in each game and their score.\n\n2. **Check Each Entry for Highest Points:**\n   - Game 76 (Row 0): Paul Pierce (32)\n   - Other games have lower scores, with the next highest being 31 by Rajon Rondo in Games 78 and 81.\n\n3. **Verify Player Name:** The claim attributes this to Stephon Marbury, but he isn't listed as the high scorer in any game. Paul Pierce is the player who scored 32 points in Game 76.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** The highest point total is correctly identified as 32, but the player is incorrect. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the celtic lose all of the game they play at td bank north garden",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the celtics lose all of the game they play at td bank north garden\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that whenever the Celtics played a game at TD Banknorth Garden, they lost all those games. So, my goal is to check each game in the table and see if every game at that location resulted in a loss for the Celtics.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns like \"game,\" \"date,\" \"team,\" \"score,\" and so on. The key columns I need to focus on are \"location attendance\" because this tells me where the game was played, and the \"score\" which indicates whether they won or lost.\n\nI'll start by examining each row (each game) in the data section of the JSON. There are 7 games listed here, from game number 76 to 82. For each of these games, I need to check two things: \n\n1. Was the location TD Banknorth Garden?\n2. Did the Celtics lose that game?\n\nLet's go through them one by one.\n\nGame 76: Location is \"td banknorth garden 18624.\" The score column says \"w 111 - 109 (2ot)\", which means they won the game in double overtime. So, this doesn't support the claim because they didn't lose; instead, they won.\n\nGame 77: Also at TD Banknorth Garden. The score is \"w 104 - 92 (ot)\". Another win for the Celtics. This contradicts the claim as well.\n\nGame 78: Again at TD Banknorth Garden. Score: \"w 106 - 104 (ot)\". They won this one too. So, still no losses here.\n\nGame 79: Location is same. The score shows a win again with \"w 105 - 98 (ot)\".\n\nGame 80: Now, the location changes to \"quicken loans arena 20562.\" Since it's not TD Banknorth Garden, we don't consider this for our claim. But looking at the score, they lost this game (\"l 76 - 107 (ot)\"). However, since it's not at the specified location, it doesn't affect our assessment.\n\nGame 81: Location is \"wachovia center 17752.\" Not TD Banknorth Garden. The Celtics won this game, but again, not relevant to our claim about that specific venue.\n\nGame 82: Back to TD Banknorth Garden. Score shows a win with \"w 115 - 107 (ot)\".\n\nSo, summarizing all the games at TD Banknorth Garden:\n\n- Games 76, 77, 78, 79, and 82 were all played there.\n- All these games resulted in wins for the Celtics.\n\nSince the claim says they lost \"all\" their games at that location, but in reality, they won every game listed there. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because it's not true that they lost all such games; instead, they won them all.\n\nI also need to identify the relevant cells from the table. Each of these games has a row index (from 0 to 6 since there are 7 games). The \"location attendance\" and \"score\" columns are crucial for each of these rows. \n\nSo, for each game at TD Banknorth Garden, I'll note both the location and the score. This helps in clearly showing that every relevant game was a win, not a loss.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the Celtics won all their games at TD Banknorth Garden.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
