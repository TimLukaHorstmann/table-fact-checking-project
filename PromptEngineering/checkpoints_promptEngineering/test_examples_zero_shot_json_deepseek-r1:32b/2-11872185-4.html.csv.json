    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"no lifetime india distributor share be give earlier than 2009\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim is saying. It states that there should be no entries where the 'lifetime india distributor share' was given before the year 2009. So, essentially, all movies in the table with a 'year' prior to 2009 shouldn't have any data in the 'lifetime india distributor share' column.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll check each row's year and see if the 'lifetime india distributor share' is present for any movie released before 2009. The relevant columns here are \"year\" and \"lifetime india distributor share\".\n\nStarting from the top:\n- Row 0: \"chennai express\", year 2013. That's after 2009, so it doesn't affect our claim.\n- Row 1: \"ek tha tiger\", year 2012. Also after 2009.\n- Row 2: \"3 idiots\", year 2009. The claim mentions earlier than 2009, so 2009 is the cutoff. This row's year is exactly 2009, so it doesn't violate the claim.\n- Row 3: \"yeh jawaani hai deewani\", year 2013. Again, after 2009.\n- Row 4: \"dabangg 2\", year 2012. After 2009.\n- Row 5: \"bodyguard\", year 2011. Still after 2009.\n- Row 6: \"dabangg\", year 2010. Also after 2009.\n- Rows 7,8,9: All have years either 2012 or later.\n\nWait a minute, I notice that all the movies in the table were released from 2009 onwards. There are no entries before 2009. So, there's nothing to check for any 'lifetime india distributor share' given earlier than 2009 because such rows don't exist in this data.\n\nTherefore, since there are no movies with a year earlier than 2009 in the table, the claim holds true based on the provided information.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as all entries are from 2009 or later. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"in 2009 ek tha tiger be first release\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that in 2009, the movie \"ek tha tiger\" was the first release. So I need to check two things: when was \"ek tha tiger\" released and what was its rank or position.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different movie with details like rank, name, year, studio, and distributor share. The columns are: rank, movie, year, studio(s), lifetime india distributor share.\n\nI'll scan through the data to find \"ek tha tiger\". From the json data provided, I see that in the second row (index 1), the movie is \"ek tha tiger\" with a release year of 2012. So that's the first piece of information: it was released in 2012, not 2009.\n\nNow, checking for movies released in 2009. The third row (index 2) has the movie \"3 idiots\" released in 2009. That's the only entry with year 2009.\n\nSo according to the table, \"ek tha tiger\" was released in 2012, and the first release in 2009 is \"3 idiots\". Therefore, the claim that \"ek tha tiger\" was the first release in 2009 is incorrect because it wasn't even released that year.\n\nTo verify this, I'll look at the relevant cells:\n\n- For \"ek tha tiger\": row index 1, columns are rank (which is 2), movie name, year (2012).\n- For 2009 releases: check each row's year. The only one in 2009 is row 2, which is \"3 idiots\" with a rank of 3.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Row 1 (ek tha tiger) for its year.\n- Rows to confirm no other movies from 2009 except row 2.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because \"ek tha tiger\" was released in 2012, not 2009, and the first release in 2009 was another movie.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"ek tha tiger\" was the first release in 2009. However, checking the table shows that \"ek tha tiger\" was released in 2012 (row 1, year). The only movie from 2009 is \"3 idiots\" (row 2), which was ranked 3rd. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"movie\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"lifetime india share earlier than 2009 be 0\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, understanding the claim: It states that movies released before 2009 have a lifetime India distributor share of zero. So, I should look for any movies in the table with a year earlier than 2009 and check their respective \"lifetime india distributor share\".\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are rank, movie, year, studio(s), and lifetime india distributor share. The relevant columns here are 'year' and 'lifetime india distributor share'.\n\nNext, I'll go through each row in the data to find movies released before 2009.\n\n- Row 1: \"chennai express\" was released in 2013.\n- Row 2: \"ek tha tiger\" was released in 2012.\n- Row 3: \"3 idiots\" was released in 2009. Wait, the claim says earlier than 2009, so 2009 is not included. Therefore, this row isn't relevant because it's exactly 2009, not earlier.\n- Rows 4 to 10: All have years starting from 2013 down to 2010 and one in 2011, none of which are before 2009.\n\nSo, there are no movies in the table with a release year earlier than 2009. Since the claim is about such movies having a share of zero, but there's no data to support or contradict it, does that mean the claim is true? Or perhaps, since no movies exist before 2009 in this dataset, the claim can't be proven false either?\n\nBut wait, the claim might imply that any movie before 2009 has a zero share. Since none of the entries are pre-2009, does that mean all such non-existent movies indeed have a zero share? Or is there ambiguity because we don't have data points for earlier years.\n\nI think in this context, since the claim is about movies before 2009 and there are no such entries in the table, it's not possible to verify if any of them have a non-zero share. However, the absence of counterexamples doesn't necessarily confirm the claim as true because we don't know about all pre-2009 movies\u2014they might exist outside this dataset.\n\nBut maybe the question is more straightforward: does the data in the table support that all movies before 2009 have a zero share. Since there are no entries before 2009, perhaps the claim is considered true because it's not contradicted by any data in the table.\n\nAlternatively, considering the logic of claims and absence of evidence, if a claim states something about a category that has no examples in the dataset, does that make the claim automatically true? Or should we consider such claims as false unless they can be confirmed?\n\nIn many logical contexts, a universal statement like \"all X have Y\" is only proven true if every possible X satisfies Y. If there are no Xs, some might argue it's vacuously true, but others might consider it unproven or perhaps irrelevant.\n\nBut in this case, since the claim says \"lifetime india share earlier than 2009 be 0\", and we have no data points with years before 2009, we can't confirm any such movies exist. Therefore, strictly speaking, the claim isn't supported by the table because there are no examples to check.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The instruction says if the claim is fully supported by the table, answer TRUE; otherwise, FALSE. Since the table doesn't have any rows with year <2009, the claim cannot be confirmed as true. Therefore, it's not fully supported, so the answer should be FALSE.\n\nWait no, perhaps another approach: The claim is \"lifetime india share earlier than 2009 be 0\". So for any movie in the table released before 2009, their lifetime share must be zero. Since there are no such movies, does that mean the condition holds? Because all zero movies satisfy it.\n\nIn logic, a statement like \"All P are Q\" is trivially true if there are no P's because there are no counterexamples. So in this case, since there are no movies before 2009, the claim is vacuously true. Therefore, the answer would be TRUE.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that. Maybe the question expects us to check whether any movie before 2009 exists with a non-zero share. Since none exist in the table, perhaps it's considered TRUE because all such movies (none) have zero shares.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is interpreted as \"all movies have their lifetime share as zero if they were released before 2009\". But since no movie was released before 2009, this doesn't contradict anything. So the answer would be TRUE.\n\nBut looking back at the table's data, all entries are from 2009 or later. The earliest year is 2009 for \"3 idiots\" and others are 2010 onwards. Therefore, there are no rows with a year before 2009 to check against.\n\nThus, since there are no counterexamples in the table (no movies before 2009), the claim isn't disproven by the data, so it's considered TRUE.\n\nBut wait, perhaps another angle: The claim says \"earlier than 2009\", which would include years like 2008 and below. Since none of those are present in the table, we can't confirm that all such movies have a zero share, but we also can't disprove it. However, since the question is about whether the claim is supported by the data, and there's no evidence against it, perhaps it's considered TRUE.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim were \"all movies have their lifetime share as zero\", which would be clearly false because some entries do have non-zero shares (though in this case, we don't know what those values are; the user didn't provide data on shares). Wait, actually, looking back at the problem statement: The user didn't specify any data about lifetime shares\u2014only that they're asking whether the claim is supported by the table.\n\nWait, hold on. I just realized\u2014the original problem description doesn't include the table's data beyond what was in the first message. So perhaps I need to refer back to that.\n\nLooking again: The user said, \"You are tasked with... [describing a task]\". They mentioned it's about movies and their release years and lifetime shares. But in my earlier processing, I didn't have specific data points except for what was inferred from the thought process.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in this scenario, as an initial user message, you're presenting a problem to me (the assistant). So perhaps I need to assume that the table has certain rows with years and shares.\n\nBut actually, the initial message provided doesn't include any specific data. It just describes a task: determining if movies released before 2009 have a lifetime share of zero.\n\nTherefore, in this context, without any actual data points (since the user didn't provide a table), perhaps I can only make logical deductions based on the problem statement.\n\nBut in that case, since there are no movies with release dates earlier than 2009, the claim is vacuously true. Thus, the answer would be TRUE.\n\nAlternatively, if we're considering whether any movie before 2009 has a non-zero share, but without data on such movies, perhaps it's safer to say that the claim can't be confirmed and thus isn't fully supported by the table, making the answer FALSE.\n\nBut I'm getting confused here. Let me try to structure my thoughts.\n\nThe problem: Determine if all movies released before 2009 have a lifetime share of zero.\n\nGiven data: A table (but in this case, as per the user's message, they haven't provided specific data beyond an example).\n\nIn the example thought process I wrote earlier, I assumed that there were no movies in the dataset with release years before 2009. Therefore, since there are no such movies, the claim can't be contradicted.\n\nBut if a universal statement is made (\"all X have Y\"), and there are no X's, then it's vacuously true because there are no counterexamples. So in that case, the answer would be TRUE.\n\nHowever, some might argue that without any data points, the claim isn't supported either, so it should be considered as not proven and thus the answer is FALSE.\n\nBut according to logical standards, an empty set satisfies any universal statement. Therefore, if there are no movies before 2009, then all such movies (none) have a zero share. So the claim holds true.\n\nTherefore, in this case, since there are no movies with release dates earlier than 2009, the answer is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe task involves determining whether all movies released before 2009 have a lifetime share of zero based on the provided data. Since the table does not contain any entries for movies released prior to 2009, there are no counterexamples to disprove the claim. In logical terms, a universal statement like \"all X have Y\" is considered true if there are no instances of X (movies before 2009 in this case). Therefore, the claim is vacuously true.\n\nAnswer: TRUE",

The claim is \"agneepath be release first in 2010.\" I need to check this against the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table data for a movie named \"agneepath.\" Scanning down the list under the \"movie\" column, I find it at row index 8. The columns are rank, movie, year, studio(s), and lifetime india distributor share.\n\nThe claim states that Agneepath was released first in 2010. So I should check the year when this movie was actually released according to the table.

Therefore, the claim is incorrect because the movie was released in 2012, not 2010.\n\nAdditionally, checking other movies around row 8 might be helpful to ensure there's no earlier release of Agneepath or any discrepancies. However, since each row represents a different movie, and only one entry for \"agneepath\" exists with the year 2012, there's no conflicting information here.\n\nSo, based on the table data provided, the claim is false because the movie was released in 2012, not 2010.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Agneepath was released first in 2010.
