    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a table in JSON format and a claim that I need to verify as TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the table carefully. The columns are: date, opponent, venue, result, attendance, and scorers. There are six rows of data, each representing a different match with various details.\n\nThe claim is: \"on march 13 1990 be play against dundee and result in 3 - 1\".\n\nI need to check if this claim aligns with the information in the table. Let's break down the components of the claim:\n\n1. **Date**: March 13, 1990\n2. **Opponent**: Dundee\n3. **Result**: 3-1\n\nSo, I'm looking for a row where all these three pieces of information match.\n\nLooking at each row in the data array:\n\n- Row 0: Date is January 26, 1990. Opponent is East Fife. Result is 1-1.\n- Row 1: Date is January 29, 1990. Opponent is East Fife. Result is 2-1.\n- Row 2: Date is February 23, 1990. Opponent is Airdrieonians. Result is 2-0.\n- Row 3: Date is March 13, 1990. Opponent is Dundee. Result is 3-1.\n\nAh, here we go! Row 3 matches all the criteria:\n\n- The date is March 13, 1990.\n- The opponent is Dundee.\n- The result is 3-1.\n\nSo, this row supports each part of the claim.\n\nNow, to compile the relevant cells:\n\n- For the date, we look at the \"date\" column in row 3.\n- For the opponent, it's under the \"opponent\" column in row 3.\n- The result is in the \"result\" column of row 3.\n\nI don't need to consider other rows since Row 3 has all the necessary information. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the data, making it TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\n- Row index 3, column name \"date\"\n- Row index 3, column name \"opponent\"\n- Row index 3, column name \"result\"\n\nI should ensure that I only include these specific cells as they directly address each part of the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the result when dundee be the opponent be 3 - 4\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim seems a bit awkwardly phrased, but it looks like it's saying that when Dundee was the opponent, the result was 3-4. So, I need to check if there's any match where the opponent is Dundee and the result is 3-4.\n\nLooking at the table, which is provided in JSON format, let me see the structure. The columns are: date, opponent, venue, result, attendance, scorers. Each row represents a different match.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one to find where the opponent is Dundee.\n\n1. First row: Opponent is East Fife. So not Dundee.\n2. Second row: Also East Fife. Not relevant.\n3. Third row: Airdrieonians as opponents. Still not Dundee.\n4. Fourth row: Opponent is Dundee. Okay, this seems promising.\n\nLooking at the fourth row details:\n- Date: 13 March 1990\n- Opponent: Dundee\n- Venue: Home (h)\n- Result: 3 - 1\n- Attendance: 16228\n- Scorers: mckinnon, jackson, ferguson\n\nWait a minute. The result here is 3-1, not 3-4 as the claim states. So this doesn't match.\n\nLet me check if there's another row where Dundee is the opponent. Scanning through the remaining rows:\n\n5. Fifth row: Opponent St Johnstone.\n6. Sixth row: Motherwell.\n\nNo other matches against Dundee in this table. So the only time Dundee was an opponent, the result was 3-1, not 3-4 as claimed.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no match where Dundee was the opponent with a result of 3-4. The relevant cell that supports this conclusion is the result column in the row where the opponent is Dundee, which is row index 3.\n\nSo, I'll structure my answer accordingly, marking it as FALSE and pointing out the specific cell.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
