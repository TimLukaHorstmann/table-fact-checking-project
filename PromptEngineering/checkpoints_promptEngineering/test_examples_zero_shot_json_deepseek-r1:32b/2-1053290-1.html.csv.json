The claim is \"the brighton hotel bombing happen in brighton , uk\". \n\nFirst, I'll examine the structure of the table provided. It's in JSON format with columns: year, event, location, perpetrator(s), and deaths. Each row represents a different event.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific pieces of information: the name of the event (\"brighton hotel bombing\") and its location (\"brighton , uk\"). I need to check if these match any entry in the table.\n\nI'll scan through each row's \"event\" column looking for \"brighton hotel bombing\". \n\nLooking at row 13 (indexing from 0, so actually row 14 in the data array), the event is listed as \"brighton hotel bombing\", and the location is \"brighton , uk\". This matches exactly with the claim.\n\nSo both pieces of information\u2014the event name and its location\u2014are correctly represented in the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"brighton hotel bombing happen in enniskillen , uk\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table to understand its structure. The table has columns: year, event, location, perpetrator(s), and deaths. Each row represents a different event with corresponding details.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific locations: \"brighton hotel bombing\" as the event and \"enniskillen , uk\" as the location where it happened. My task is to check if these two pieces of information align in the table.\n\nI'll start by looking for entries related to the Brighton Hotel Bombing. Scanning through the events, I find a row with the event name \"brighton hotel bombing.\" Let me note down its details: year 1984, location \"brighton , uk\", perpetrators IRA, and deaths 5.\n\nNext, I need to verify if this event indeed happened in Enniskillen, UK. According to the table, the location for the Brighton Hotel Bombing is listed as \"brighton , uk,\" not Enniskillen. \n\nWait a second, looking back at the claim again: it says the bombing happened in Enniskillen, UK. But from the table, the actual location is Brighton. That's different.\n\nNow, checking if there's another entry related to Enniskillen. I find an event called \"remembrance day bombing\" which took place in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland, with IRA as perpetrators and 12 deaths in 1987.\n\nSo, the claim incorrectly associates the Brighton Hotel Bombing (which occurred in Brighton) with Enniskillen. The correct location for that event is Brighton, not Enniskillen. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nTo summarize, the relevant cells are from two rows: one where the event is \"brighton hotel bombing\" and another where the location is Enniskillen. This shows a mismatch between the claimed location and the actual data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Brighton Hotel Bombing occurred in Enniskillen, UK. However, according to the table, the Brighton Hotel Bombing took place in Brighton, not Enniskillen. The relevant cells confirm this discrepancy.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
