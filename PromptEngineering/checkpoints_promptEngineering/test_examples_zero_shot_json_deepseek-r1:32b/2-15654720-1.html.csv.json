    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"in the 2002 - 2003 season there be 6 cash , a match play smaller than 13 and 7 event.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down each part of the claim to check against the data.\n\n1. **Season Identification**: The claim refers to the \"2002-2003\" season. Looking at the table's first column under \"season,\" I see that the first row corresponds to this period (row index 0).\n\n2. **Number of Cashes**: The claim mentions \"6 cash.\" In the table, the third column is labeled \"cashes.\" For the 2002-03 season, the value here is 6. This matches the claim exactly.\n\n3. **Match Play Value**: The claim states that the match play is smaller than 13. The column for \"match play\" is the fourth one in the table. In row index 0, it shows a value of 2. Since 2 is indeed less than 13, this condition holds true.\n\n4. **Number of Events**: Lastly, the claim says there were 7 events. Checking the second column, which lists \"events,\" for the 2002-03 season, we find the number is 7. This matches the claim as well.\n\nAll parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"cashes\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"match play\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"events\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"6 cash have earnings of 39380\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. The phrase \"6 cash\" likely refers to a value in the \"cashes\" column being 6. Then, \"earnings of 39380\" should correspond to the \"earnings\" column having that specific number for the same row where \"cashes\" is 6.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a season with various statistics. The columns are: season, events, cashes, match play, tv finals, pba titles, average, and earnings. So, I'm focusing on the \"cashes\" and \"earnings\" columns.\n\nI'll go through each row to find where \"cashes\" equals 6. Scanning through the data:\n\n- 2002 - 03: cashes = 6\n- Other rows have higher numbers like 15, 19, 22, etc., except for later seasons which drop but not down to 6 again.\n\nSo, only the first row has \"cashes\" equal to 6. Now, I'll check what the earnings are in that same row. The first row's earnings are listed as 9500, not 39380. \n\nTherefore, the claim states that when cashes are 6, the earnings are 39380, but according to the table, when cashes are 6, earnings are actually 9500. This discrepancy means the claim is false.\n\nTo ensure I'm not missing anything, I'll double-check all rows again. None have both \"cashes\" as 6 and \"earnings\" as 39380 except for that first row which doesn't match. Hence, my conclusion stands.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that a cashes value of 6 corresponds to earnings of 39380. However, the table shows that when cashes are 6 (in the 2002-03 season), the earnings are actually 9500. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"cashes\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
