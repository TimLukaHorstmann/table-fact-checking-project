    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table in JSON format and wants to determine if the claim \"every horse in the race be train by john oxx\" is TRUE or FALSE.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is stating. It claims that every horse in each of these races was trained by John Oxx. So, my task is to verify this against the data provided in the table.\n\nLooking at the JSON structure, there are columns listed under \"columns\". The relevant column here is \"trainer\", which should contain the name of the trainer for each race entry.\n\nNext, I'll go through each row of the data and check the value in the \"trainer\" column. The rows are zero-indexed, so the first row is index 0, the second is index 1, and so on.\n\nRow 0: Trainer is \"john oxx\"\nRow 1: Trainer is \"john oxx\"\nRow 2: Trainer is \"john oxx\"\nRow 3: Trainer is \"john oxx\"\nRow 4: Trainer is \"john oxx\"\nRow 5: Trainer is \"john oxx\"\nRow 6: Trainer is \"john oxx\"\nRow 7: Trainer is \"john oxx\"\n\nSince all the trainers in every row are listed as \"john oxx\", this supports the claim. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, to compile the relevant cells, each row's \"trainer\" column needs to be included. This means for each row index from 0 to 7, I'll add an object with \"row_index\" and \"column_name\" set to \"trainer\".\n\nSo, the JSON response will include all these entries under \"relevant_cells\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"trainer\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"trainer\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"trainer\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"trainer\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"trainer\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"trainer\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"trainer\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"trainer\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"every horse in the race be ride by johnny murtagh\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The table has several columns: race, dist (f), course, class, prize (k), odds, runners, placing, margin, time, jockey, and trainer. \n\nFirst, I should understand what each column represents to see which ones are relevant for this claim. Since the claim is about who rode each horse, the \"jockey\" column seems directly related. Each row in the data corresponds to a different race or event, and within each row, there's information about that specific race.\n\nLooking at the \"jockey\" column across all rows, I need to check if every entry is Johnny Murtagh. Let me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **First Row**: The jockey is listed as \"johnny murtagh\". That matches.\n2. **Second Row**: Again, \"johnny murtagh\" is the jockey. Still a match.\n3. **Third Row**: Same here, it's Johnny Murtagh again. So far so good.\n4. **Fourth Row**: The jockey is still Johnny Murtagh. Consistent.\n5. **Fifth Row**: Again, \"johnny murtagh\". No issues yet.\n6. **Sixth Row**: Also Johnny Murtagh. Still consistent.\n7. **Seventh Row**: This row also has \"johnny murtagh\" as the jockey. \n8. **Eighth Row**: The last row shows Johnny Murtagh once more.\n\nSince every single entry in the \"jockey\" column is Johnny Murtagh, it appears that all horses in these races were ridden by him.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the shortest race be at national stake and dance design maiden\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully. It says that the shortest races are at two specific events: National Stake and Dance Design Maiden. So, I'm looking to verify if both these races have the shortest distance as per the data given.\n\nLooking at the table's columns, I see that \"dist (f)\" represents the distance in furlongs. This is the column we'll focus on since it relates to the length of each race.\n\nNow, let me go through each row and note down the distances for each race mentioned in the claim as well as others to compare.\n\nStarting with Dance Design EBF Maiden: It's listed first, with a distance of 8 furlongs. Next, National Stakes is second with the same distance of 8 furlongs. Then, Ballysax Stakes at 10 f, Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial also at 10 f, Epsom Derby at 12 f, Irish Derby at 12 f, Prix Niel at 12 f, and finally Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at 12 f.\n\nWait a minute, so both Dance Design Maiden and National Stake are at 8 furlongs. But looking at the other races, Ballysax Stakes is longer, at 10 f, and then all others beyond that are 12 f. So, it seems like 8 f is indeed the shortest distance in this table.\n\nBut here's where I need to be careful. The claim says both these races are the shortest. However, when I look at all the entries, I see that 8 furlongs isn't unique to just these two. There might be other races with the same or shorter distances, but in this data, it appears they're tied for the shortest.\n\nWait no, actually, looking again, the first two are both 8, which is the smallest number in the \"dist (f)\" column. The next ones go up to 10 and then to 12, so yes, 8 is indeed the shortest distance present here. Therefore, both National Stake and Dance Design Maiden have the shortest race distances.\n\nBut wait, am I sure that no other races are shorter? Let me double-check all the rows:\n\nRow 0: 8 f\nRow 1: 8 f\nRow 2: 10 f\nRow 3: 10 f\nRow 4: 12 f\nRow 5: 12 f\nRow 6: 12 f\nRow 7: 12 f\n\nSo yes, the two shortest races are at 8 f, which includes both National Stake and Dance Design Maiden. Therefore, the claim is correct.\n\nNow, to map this back to the relevant cells in the table. Each of these two races will have their \"dist (f)\" column checked. So for row index 0 (Dance Design EBF Maiden) and row index 1 (National Stakes), we'll look at the \"dist (f)\" column.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The claim is TRUE because both specified races are indeed the shortest with a distance of 8 furlongs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"dist (f)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"dist (f)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the most popular course be curragh where 3 race take placing\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions two main points:\n1. The most popular course is Curragh.\n2. At Curragh, three races took first place (placing).\n\nTo verify this, I'll go through each part separately.\n\nStarting with the first point: determining if Curragh is the most popular course. Looking at the table, the column named \"course\" lists where each race was held. Let's count how many times each course appears.\n\nLooking through each row:\n- Row 0: Curragh\n- Row 1: Curragh\n- Row 2: Leopardstown\n- Row 3: Leopardstown\n- Row 4: Epsom\n- Row 5: Curragh\n- Row 6: Longchamp\n- Row 7: Longchamp\n\nSo, counting the occurrences:\n- Curragh appears in rows 0,1,5 \u2192 that's three times.\n- Leopardstown appears in rows 2,3 \u2192 twice.\n- Epsom once (row4), and Longchamp twice (rows6,7).\n\nTherefore, Curragh is indeed the most popular course with three races held there.\n\nNext, checking if at Curragh, three races took first place. We need to look at the \"placing\" column for each race that was at Curragh.\n\nLooking at rows where \"course\" is Curragh:\n- Row 0: Placing is 1 \u2192 First place.\n- Row 1: Placing is 1 \u2192 First place.\n- Row5: Placing is 1 \u2192 First place.\n\nSo all three races at Curragh resulted in a first-place finish. That means, yes, three races took placing (first place) there.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are accurate. So the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"course\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"course\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"course\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"placing\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"placing\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"placing\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out whether the claim \"the most runner where at epsom with a total of 15\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim is saying. It mentions two main points: \n1. The race location was Epsom.\n2. There were 15 runners in that race.\n\nLooking at the columns in the table, I see \"course\" which indicates the location of each race and \"runners\" which shows how many participants were in each race. So, these two columns are relevant for verifying the claim.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to check where the course is Epsom and then see how many runners participated there.\n\nRow 0: Course is Curragh. Not relevant.\nRow 1: Course is Curragh again. Not relevant.\nRow 2: Leopardstown. No match for Epsom.\nRow 3: Leopardstown again. Still not Epsom.\nRow 4: Here, the course is Epsom. Let me check the number of runners in this row. The \"runners\" column shows 15. That matches the claim exactly.\nRows 5-7: Courses are Curragh, Longchamp, and Longchamp respectively, so none of these match Epsom.\n\nSo, there's only one race at Epsom with 15 runners. Since the claim specifies that this was the most runner (assuming they mean the highest number of participants), and in the table, the highest number under \"runners\" is indeed 15, which occurred at Epsom. Therefore, the claim is correct.\n\nI'll note down the relevant cells: the course column for row 4 where it's Epsom, and the runners column for the same row showing 15.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"course\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"runners\"}]}",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that only half of the horses were trained by John Oxx. So, I need to check how many horses were trained by him and see if exactly half fit that description.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a race, and within each row, there's a \"trainer\" column which indicates who the trainer is for that particular horse in that race. The \"trainer\" is listed as \"john oxx\" consistently across all rows. Wait, let me check each row to be sure.\n\nRow 0: Trainer is John Oxx.\nRow 1: Trainer is John Oxx.\nRow 2: Trainer is John Oxx.\nRow 3: Trainer is John Oxx.\nRow 4: Trainer is John Oxx.\nRow 5: Trainer is John Oxx.\nRow 6: Trainer is John Oxx.\nRow 7: Trainer is John Oxx.\n\nSo, all 8 races have John Oxx as the trainer. That means every horse in each of these races was trained by him. The claim says \"only half\" were trained by him, but according to the table, it's actually 100%. Therefore, the claim is not accurate\u2014it\u2019s FALSE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to point out all the trainer entries since they are the ones that determine whether each horse was trained by John Oxx.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"johnny murtagh ride only 1 horse in the race\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It states that Johnny Murtagh rode only one horse in a particular race. However, looking at the structure of the table, each row represents a different race with various details including the jockey. So, the claim might be interpreted as whether Johnny Murtagh only rode one horse across all these races listed.\n\nLooking at the table's columns: \"race\", \"dist (f)\", \"course\", etc., and specifically the \"jockey\" column which is consistent across all rows, I can check how many times Johnny Murtagh appears as the jockey. If he appears more than once, the claim would be FALSE; otherwise, it would be TRUE.\n\nExamining each row:\n- Row 0: Johnny Murtagh is listed as the jockey.\n- Row 1: Johnny Murtagh again.\n- Row 2: Same here.\n- Row 3: Still Johnny Murtagh.\n- Row 4: Yep, same name.\n- Row 5: Continues with him.\n- Row 6: Again Johnny Murtagh.\n- Row 7: And the last row also has him.\n\nSo, Johnny Murtagh is listed in every single race as the jockey. That means he rode multiple horses across different races, not just one. Therefore, the claim that he \"ride only 1 horse in the race\" is FALSE because it's implying he rode a single horse, but in reality, he was involved in eight different races with his name appearing each time.\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the claim. The claim says \"only 1 horse in the race.\" So perhaps it refers to a specific race where Johnny Murtagh only rode one horse. But in each row of the table, each entry is a separate race, and in each of those races, he was the jockey for one horse. So if we look at any individual race from the table, he rode one horse per race.\n\nBut the way the claim is phrased might be ambiguous. It could mean that across all races, he only ever rode one horse once, which isn't the case here because he appears multiple times. Alternatively, it could mean in each race, he only rode one horse, which is true but perhaps not what the claim is getting at.\n\nHowever, considering the context of the table and the fact that each row represents a different race, if the claim is about him riding only once across all races, then it's FALSE. But if it's saying in any given race he rode only one horse, then it's TRUE because each race lists him as jockey for one entry.\n\nBut the way the question is structured might be looking at whether across all races, he only had one ride. Since there are multiple rows with his name, that would make it FALSE because he has more than one ride.\n\nWait, perhaps another angle: if the claim is about a specific race where he rode only one horse, but each row is a separate race, so for each individual race in the table, Johnny Murtagh was the jockey for one horse. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because in each race listed, he rode only once.\n\nBut this is confusing. The wording of the claim isn't entirely clear whether it's about a specific race or across all races. Given that, but looking at the example provided earlier where the answer was FALSE because Johnny Murtagh appeared multiple times, I think the intended interpretation is whether he rode more than one horse across the races listed.\n\nTherefore, since in each row (race) he's listed as jockey once, and there are eight rows, so he has eight rides. Hence, the claim that he rode only one horse in the race(s) would be FALSE because it implies he had just one ride in total, but the table shows multiple.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"jockey\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"jockey\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"jockey\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"jockey\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"jockey\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"jockey\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"jockey\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"jockey\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"curragh be the least popular course so only 1 race take placing there\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's suggesting that Curragh is the least popular course because only one race was held there where a placement occurred. So, I have to check two things: how many races took place at Curragh and whether any other courses had fewer races than Curragh.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant columns are \"course\" and \"placing\". The claim mentions that only 1 race took placing at Curragh, which implies that there's only one entry where the course is Curragh and the placing is recorded (i.e., not zero or something else).\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Course is curragh. Placing is 1.\nRow 1: Course is curragh. Placing is 1.\nRow 2: Course is leopardstown.\nRow 3: Course is leopardstown.\nRow 4: Course is epsom.\nRow 5: Course is curragh. Placing is 1.\nRow 6: Course is longchamp.\nRow 7: Course is longchamp.\n\nWait, I see that Curragh appears in rows 0, 1, and 5. So that's three races at Curragh. Each of these has a placing (1), so the claim says only one race took place there, which is not accurate. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because Curragh actually had three races with placements.\n\nAdditionally, to check if it's the least popular, I should count the number of races per course:\n\n- Curragh: 3 races\n- Leopardstown: 2 races\n- Epsom: 1 race\n- Longchamp: 2 races\n\nWait, no. Let me recount properly:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: curragh\nRow 1: curragh\nRow 5: curragh\nSo that's three rows with course as curragh.\n\nOther courses:\nLeopardstown in rows 2 and 3: 2 races.\nEpsom in row4: 1 race.\nLongchamp in rows6 and7: 2 races.\n\nWait, no, row5 is also curragh. So total for each:\n\ncurragh: rows0,1,5 \u2192 3\nleopardstown: rows2,3 \u2192 2\nepsom: row4 \u21921\nlongchamp: rows6,7\u21922\n\nSo the least popular would be epsom with only one race. Therefore, the claim that curragh is the least popular is incorrect because it actually has more races than epsom.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are all the ones where course is curragh and their placing. So row0,1,5 under \"course\" and \"placing\".\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"course\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"placing\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"course\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"placing\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"course\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"placing\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the national stake and dance design abf be where the longest race take placing",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully reading and understanding the claim.\n\nThe claim states: \"the national stake and dance design abf be where the longest race take placing.\" Hmm, that wording is a bit unclear. It seems like it's trying to say that both the National Stakes and Dance Design EBF Maiden are races where the longest race took place.\n\nWait, actually, maybe it's saying that these two races are where the longest races happened in terms of distance or time. Let me parse this again. The claim might be implying that these two events have the longest distances among all the races listed.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different race with various details. I need to focus on the \"dist (f)\" column because that indicates the distance in furlongs, which would determine how long each race is.\n\nSo first, let's list out all the races and their distances:\n\n1. Dance Design EBF Maiden: 8\n2. National Stakes: 8\n3. Ballysax Stakes: 10\n4. Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial: 10\n5. Epsom Derby: 12\n6. Irish Derby: 12\n7. Prix Niell: 12\n8. Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe: 12\n\nWait, actually, in the data array:\n\n- The first row is \"dance design ebf maiden\" with dist (f) of 8.\n- Second row is \"national stakes\" also 8.\n- Third row is \"ballysax stakes\" at 10.\n- Fourth is \"derrinstown stud derby trial\" at 10.\n- Fifth: Epsom Derby is 12\n- Sixth: Irish Derby is 12\n- Seventh: Prix Niell is 12\n- Eighth: Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe is 12.\n\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nThe \"dist (f)\" column in the data array is as follows for each row:\n\nRow 0: 8\n\nRow 1: 8\n\nRow 2: 10\n\nRow 3: 10\n\nRow 4: 12\n\nRow 5: 12\n\nRow 6: 12\n\nRow 7: 12.\n\nSo the longest distance is 12 furlongs, and it's present in four races: Epsom Derby, Irish Derby, Prix Niell, and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. The National Stakes (row 1) and Dance Design EBF Maiden (row 0) are both at 8 furlongs.\n\nSo the claim is saying that these two events are where the longest races took place. But according to the data, their distance isn't the longest; it's actually shorter than several others.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the claim. Maybe \"longest race take placing\" refers to the time taken? Let me check. The \"time\" column shows the duration of each race.\n\nLooking at row 0: time is 1:41.80 (which is minutes:seconds)\n\nRow 1: 1:46.20\n\nRow 2: 2:19.70\n\nRow 3: 2:04.90\n\nRow 4: 2:36.75\n\nRow 5: 2:33.90\n\nRow 6: 2:26.40\n\nRow 7: 2:25.80.\n\nSo the longest time is row 4 (Epsom Derby) at 2 minutes and 36.75 seconds, followed by row 5 (Irish Derby) at 2:33.90, then row 2 (Ballysax Stakes) at 2:19.70.\n\nSo the claim could be referring to time as well. However, the claim specifically mentions \"the national stake and dance design abf\" where these two races are in rows 0 and 1, with times of 1:41.80 and 1:46.20 respectively. Neither of those is among the longest times; they're actually on the shorter side.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"longest race take placing\" refers to the number of runners? Let's check that column.\n\nRow 0: 13 runners\n\nRow 1: 8 runners\n\nRow 2:4 runners\n\nRow3:4 runners\n\nRow4: probably not listed but in row 5 it's 12, row6: 12, row7:12? Wait, let me check the \"runners\" column.\n\nWait, looking back at the table structure:\n\nThe columns are: [Name of race], dist (f), time, runners?\n\nWait, no. The user didn't specify all columns, but in the data array, each row has elements like 'dance design ebf maiden', 8, '1:41.80', etc.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nRow 0: ['dance design ebf maiden', 8, '1:41.80', ...] \n\nBut perhaps \"runners\" isn't a separate column; maybe it's another metric. Alternatively, perhaps \"placing\" refers to finishing position or something else.\n\nWait, I think the key is that \"longest race take placing\" might mean which races have the longest distance (furlongs). So if the claim is that National Stakes and Dance Design EBF are where the longest races took place, but in reality, those races are only 8 furlongs, while others are longer.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because those two races aren't among the longest; instead, the longest are at 12 furlongs. So the answer would be FALSE.\n\nBut let me double-check: the user's question is whether these two races (National Stakes and Dance Design EBF) are where the longest races took place. If \"longest\" refers to distance, then they're not; if it refers to time, again, they're not. So the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both the National Stakes and Dance Design EBF Maiden are where the longest races took place. However, based on the table data:\n\n- **Distance (furlongs)**: The longest distance is 12 furlongs, found in four races: Epsom Derby, Irish Derby, Prix Niell, and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. National Stakes (8) and Dance Design EBF Maiden (8) are shorter.\n- **Time**: Neither of these two races has the longest duration.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE as these races are not where the longest took place.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"result\": \"FALSE\"\n}\n```",

    "claim": "epsom have only 4 runner , make it the lowest attend race",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"epsom have only 4 runner , make it the lowest attend race\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that Epsom has only 4 runners and that makes it the lowest attended race. So, two parts here: checking if Epsom indeed had 4 runners and then seeing if that's the lowest number of runners in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a different race with various details. The columns include \"race,\" \"dist (f),\" \"course,\" etc., but importantly, there's a column named \"runners.\" This is crucial because the claim talks about the number of runners.\n\nI'll go through each row to find the one where the course is Epsom. Scanning the \"course\" column:\n\n1. First row: Curragh\n2. Second row: Curragh\n3. Third row: Leopardstown\n4. Fourth row: Leopardstown\n5. Fifth row: Epsom \u2013 this is the one we're interested in.\n6. Sixth row: Curragh\n7. Seventh row: Longchamp\n8. Eighth row: Longchamp\n\nSo, the fifth row corresponds to the race at Epsom. Now, checking the \"runners\" column for that row. The value there is 15. Wait, that's 15 runners, not 4 as the claim states. Hmm, this seems contradictory.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Looking back at the fifth row: [\"epsom derby\", 12, \"epsom\", \"1\", 609, \"7  - 1\", 15, ...]. Yep, runners are 15. So the claim says Epsom has only 4 runners, but according to this data, it's actually 15.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there are other races at Epsom? Let me check all rows again. No, only the fifth row is at Epsom. So the number of runners for that race is indeed 15.\n\nNow, the second part of the claim says this makes it the lowest attended race. But if Epsom had 4 runners (as per the claim), I need to check if any other races have fewer than 4 runners. Let's look at all \"runners\" values:\n\n- Row 0: 13\n- Row 1: 8\n- Row 2: 4\n- Row 3: 4\n- Row 4: 15 (Epsom)\n- Row 5: 11\n- Row 6: 6\n- Row 7: 10\n\nWait, rows 2 and 3 both have 4 runners each. So if Epsom had 4 runners, it wouldn't be the lowest because there are other races with the same number of runners. But in reality, Epsom has 15 runners, which is actually higher than some others.\n\nSo putting it all together: The claim states that Epsom has only 4 runners, but according to the table, Epsom's race had 15 runners. Therefore, the first part of the claim is false. Additionally, even if we consider the number of runners for other races, there are races with fewer runners than 15 (like row 2 and 3 with 4 each), which makes Epsom's race not the lowest attended.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim don't hold true based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Epsom has only 4 runners and is the lowest attended. However, the table shows Epsom had 15 runners, and there are races with fewer runners (e.g., rows 2 and 3). Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"runners\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
