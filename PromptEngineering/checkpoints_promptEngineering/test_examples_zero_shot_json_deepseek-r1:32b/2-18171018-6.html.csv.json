    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"player gil morgan represent the united state tie for 7th place with - 2 to par.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each part of the claim and see if it matches the information in the table.\n\nStarting with the player's name, \"gil morgan.\" Scanning the \"player\" column, I find a row where the player is indeed Gil Morgan. That seems correct.\n\nNext, checking his country. The claim says he represents the United States. In the table, under the \"country\" column for Gil Morgan, it does say \"united states,\" so that's accurate.\n\nNow, about the place. The claim mentions he tied for 7th place. Looking at the \"place\" column for Gil Morgan's row, I see it says \"t7.\" The 't' likely stands for 'tie,' so this supports the claim of tying for 7th place.\n\nLastly, checking the \"to par\" score. The table shows \"- 2\" for Gil Morgan, which matches the claim that he has a -2 to par.\n\nAll parts of the claim are supported by the relevant cells in the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n   ]\n}",
