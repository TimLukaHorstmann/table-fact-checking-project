    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the maverick be the only team to join after 1970\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It states that the Mavericks were the only team to join after 1970. So, I need to check two things: when the Mavericks joined and whether any other teams also joined after 1970.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the relevant columns are \"team name\" and \"year joined\". The claim is about joining years, so I should focus on those cells.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Red Ramblers, year joined 1947 \u2192 before 1970.\n2. **Row 1**: Oracles, 1947 \u2192 same as above.\n3. **Row 2**: Badgers, 1947 \u2192 same.\n4. **Row 3**: Bombers, 1947 \u2192 same.\n5. **Row 4**: Hornets, 1947 \u2192 same.\n6. **Row 5**: Warriors, 1947 \u2192 same.\n7. **Row 6**: Black Hawks, years 1948 and 2000. The claim says \"join after 1970\", so joining in 2000 is after 1970. But wait, does that count? Also, the team name here isn't Mavericks.\n8. **Row 7**: Wildcats, 1958 \u2192 before.\n9. **Row 8**: Panthers, 1958 \u2192 same.\n10. **Row 9**: Cougars, 1961 \u2192 before.\n11. **Row 10**: Gophers, 1961 \u2192 same.\n12. **Row 11**: Knights, 1970 \u2192 exactly 1970, so not after.\n13. **Row 12**: Raiders, 1970 \u2192 same as above.\n14. **Row 13**: Mavericks, year joined is 1975 \u2192 which is after 1970.\n\nNow, checking if any other team besides the Mavericks joined after 1970. Looking back at Row 6: Black Hawks have a year of \"1948 2000\". I'm not sure how to interpret this. It might mean they joined in two different years, one before and one after 1970. If that's the case, then Black Hawks also joined after 1970, making the Mavericks not the only team.\n\nSo, if Black Hawks count as a team joining after 1970, the claim is FALSE because they are another team besides the Mavericks who joined after 1970.\n\nI'll list all rows where \"year joined\" is after 1970. Rows 6 and 13 both have years after 1970. Therefore, the claim that Mavericks were the only ones is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because besides the Mavericks (joined in 1975), the Black Hawks also joined in 2000.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"rossville school leave the conference 30 year after join\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that the Rossville school left the conference 30 years after it joined. So, essentially, the claim is asserting that the number of years between joining and leaving is exactly 30 years for Rossville.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the relevant columns are \"year joined\" and \"year left\". I'll need to find the row corresponding to Rossville and check these two columns.\n\nFrom the data provided, let's go through each row:\n\n1. The first few rows don't mention Rossville.\n2. Scanning down, I see a row where the school is \"rossville\", located in \"rossville\" with team name \"hornets\", county \"12 clinton\", joined in 1947, and left in 1977.\n\nSo for this row:\n- Year Joined: 1947\n- Year Left: 1977\n\nTo find out how many years passed between joining and leaving, I'll subtract the year joined from the year left. That would be 1977 minus 1947, which equals 30 years.\n\nSince the claim states that Rossville left exactly 30 years after joining, and our calculation confirms this (1977 - 1947 = 30), the claim is accurate.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE. The relevant cells are in row index 4 for both \"year joined\" and \"year left\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year left\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the team from the city of attica leave before the team from the city of west lafayette join\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts: when did the team from Attica leave, and when did the team from West Lafayette join?\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for rows where the \"city\" is \"attica\". From the data, the first row has \"city\": \"attica\", and the \"year left\" column shows 1966. So the Attica team left in 1966.\n\nNext, I need to find the team from West Lafayette. Checking the table, I see a row where \"city\" is \"west lafayette\". The \"year joined\" for this team is listed as 1970. Wait, actually, looking closer, there's a school named \"harrison (west lafayette)\" in west lafayette city. Its year joined is 1970.\n\nSo, the Attica team left in 1966, and the West Lafayette team joined in 1970. Since 1966 comes before 1970, the claim that Attica's team left before West Lafayette's team joined is correct.\n\nI should also verify if there are any other teams from these cities to make sure I haven't missed anything. Scanning through, I don't see any other entries for attica or west lafayette beyond what I've already considered. Therefore, my conclusion stands.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the team from Attica left before the West Lafayette team joined.

It claims that the Hornets are not the only team from Clinton County (which seems to be represented as \"12 clinton\" in the table). So I need to check if there's more than one team associated with \"12 clinton\".\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a school and its details, including the county. The relevant columns here are \"team name\" and \"county\". \n\nI'll go through each row and note down which teams belong to \"12 clinton\" county.\n\nRow 4: Team is \"hornets\", county is \"12 clinton\".\nRow 9: Team is \"gophers\", county is \"12 clinton\".\n\nSo, there are at least two teams from \"12 clinton\": Hornets and Gophers.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the school of rossville and clinton prairie leave 3 year apart\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that Rossville and Clinton Prairie schools left (presumably their respective organizations) three years apart from each other. So I need to find out when each of these schools left and then calculate the difference between those two years.\n\nLooking at the table columns: \"school\", \"city\", \"team name\", \"county\", \"year joined\", \"year left\". The relevant columns here are \"year left\" for both Rossville and Clinton Prairie.\n\nI'll start by locating the rows corresponding to these schools. \n\n1. **Rossville**: Scanning through the data, I find a row where \"school\" is \"rossville\". The data array shows that this is at index 4. Let me check: \n   - school: rossville\n   - year left: 1977\n\n2. **Clinton Prairie**: Next, I look for the school named \"clinton prairie\". This appears in row index 10:\n   - school: clinton prairie\n   - year left: 1974\n\nNow that I have both years, I need to calculate the difference between these two years. \n\nSubtracting the later year from the earlier one:\n- 1977 (Rossville) minus 1974 (Clinton Prairie) equals 3 years.\n\nSo, the time between their leaving is exactly three years apart.

Looking at the table, I'll search for this school name.\n   - Scanning through the rows, I find \"rensselaer central\" in row index 3.\n\n2. **City**: The claim says it's in \"rossville\".

The claim is: \"rossville school in rossville join the conference in 1958 and leave 10 year later.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It's a JSON structure with columns like school, city, team name, county, year joined, and year left. There are multiple rows of data.\n\nThe claim mentions \"rossville school in rossville,\" so I'm looking for a row where both the school and city columns are \"rossville.\" Scanning through the data, I see that at row index 4 (since counting starts from 0), there's an entry: [\"rossville\", \"rossville\", ...]. So this is the relevant row.\n\nNext, checking the claim's details. It says they joined in 1958 and left 10 years later, which would be 1968. Looking at the \"year joined\" column for rossville, it's listed as 1947. That doesn't match the claim of 1958. Then, the \"year left\" is 1977, so if they had joined in 1958, leaving in 1968 would be 10 years later.

The claim mentions two teams: Carroll and Harrison (West Lafayette). \n\nLooking through the data, I find that the row with \"school\" as \"carroll\" is at index 9. Checking its \"year joined\" column, it shows \"1961\". So, Carroll joined in 1961.\n\nNext, searching for \"harrison (west lafayette)\", this team is listed at row index 13. Its \"year joined\" is \"1970\".\n\nThe claim states that Carroll joined in 1970 before Harrison, but according to the table, Carroll actually joined in 1961, which is earlier than Harrison's 1970. Therefore, the claim is correct because Carroll did join before Harrison, even though the year mentioned in the claim for Carroll is incorrect.\n\nWait a minute, I need to be careful here. The claim says \"join in 1970\" for Carroll, but the table shows they joined in 1961. So, while it's true that Carroll joined before Harrison, the specific year in the claim (1970) is wrong. However, since the main point is about joining before Harrison, which is correct, maybe the answer should be TRUE based on the order, despite the incorrect year mentioned.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim requires both the year and the order to be accurate, then it would be FALSE because the year for Carroll is wrong. But I think the primary assertion is about the order of joining, so perhaps it's TRUE.\n\nBut wait, the claim specifically states that \"the team from carroll join in 1970\", which contradicts the table showing they joined in 1961. Therefore, the claim has incorrect information about the year Carroll joined, making the entire statement FALSE because part of it is inaccurate.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Carroll joined in 1970 when they actually joined in 1961.

The claim says: \"only 1 team from 12 clinton county and 1 team from carroll county join.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse what the claim is stating. It seems like it's talking about teams joining something, perhaps a league or organization. The counties mentioned are \"12 clinton\" and \"carroll\". I need to check how many teams each of these counties have in the table.\n\nLooking at the columns: school, city, team name, county, year joined, year left. So for each team (row), there's a 'county' column that indicates which county they belong to. The claim refers to two specific counties: \"12 clinton\" and \"carroll\".\n\nI'll go through each row of the data and count how many teams are from each of these counties.\n\nStarting with \"12 clinton\":\n- Row 4: team is \"rossville\", county \"12 clinton\". That's one.\n- Are there others? Let me check all rows:\n   - Row 0: \"23 fountain\" \u2013 not relevant\n   - Row 1: \"08 carroll\"\n   - Row 2: \"08 carroll\"\n   - Row 3: \"37 jasper\"\n   - Row 4: \"12 clinton\" \u2013 count 1\n   - Row 5: \"66 pulaski\"\n   - Row 6: \"29 hamilton\"\n   - Row 7: \"79 tippecanoe\"\n   - Row 8: \"34 howard\"\n   - Row 9: \"08 carroll\" \u2013 this is different; the county here is \"08 carroll\", not \"carroll\". So, row 1 and 2 are \"08 carroll\", which I think refers to Carroll County with code 08. The claim says \"carroll county\", so maybe it's referring to the same as \"08 carroll\".\n   - Row 10: \"12 clinton\" \u2013 another one, count now 2.\n   - Row 11: \"79 tippecanoe\"\n   - Row 12: \"79 tippecanoe\"\n   - Row 13: \"79 tippecanoe\"\n\nWait, row 4 and row 10 both have county \"12 clinton\". So that's two teams from 12 Clinton County. But the claim says only one team from each.\n\nNow checking for \"carroll\" counties:\n- The county field has entries like \"08 carroll\", which I think is Carroll County.\n   - Row 1: \"08 carroll\"\n   - Row 2: \"08 carroll\"\n   - Row 9: \"08 carroll\"\n\nSo that's three teams from \"carroll\" counties.\n\nThe claim states only one team from each, but according to the table, there are two from Clinton and three from Carroll.

So, I need to find the \"year joined\" for both these schools in the table and check if there's a 10-year difference.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a school with details like school name, city, team name, county, year joined, and year left. The columns are: school, city, team name, county, year joined, year left.\n\nLet me locate the rows for winamac and southwestern.\n\nStarting with winamac:\n- Scanning through the data, I see a row where the school is \"winamac\". Let's check its details. The year joined here is listed as 1947. So, winamac joined in 1947.\n\nNow, finding southwestern:\n- Looking for \"southwestern\" in the school column. There's a row with \"southwestern\" under city \"lafayette\", team name \"wildcats\", county \"79 tippecanoe\". The year joined here is 1958.\n\nWait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't mix up any rows. Yes, the data for winamac shows year joined as 1947, and southwestern's year joined is indeed 1958.\n\nNow, calculating the difference between 1958 (southwestern) and 1947 (winamac). Let me subtract: 1958 - 1947 equals 11 years. So, winamac actually joined 11 years before southwestern, not 10 years after.\n\nWait a second, the claim says \"join 10 year after\". That would mean that winamac's year joined should be 1958 + 10 = 1968? But no, because if southwestern joined in 1958, then 10 years later would be 1968. However, winamac joined in 1947, which is before that.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the claim. Let me read it again: \"winamac join 10 year after southwestern join\". So, does this mean winamac joined 10 years after southwestern? That would imply that if southwestern joined in 1958, then winamac would have joined in 1968 (since 1958 +10 =1968). But in the table, winamac's year is 1947, which is earlier than 1958. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm interpreting it wrong. The claim could mean that the time between when each joined is 10 years. If winamac joined after southwestern by 10 years, then we'd have to see if the difference is 10. But in this case, the difference is actually 1958 -1947 =11 years.\n\nSo, the claim is that winamac joined 10 years after southwestern. The data shows a 11-year gap instead of 10, so the claim isn't correct. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the order. Perhaps the claim is that winamac joined 10 years after southwestern, meaning winamac's year would be 1958 +10 =1968, but in reality, it's 1947, which is before. So definitely not 10 years later.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the claim as \"join 10 years after\", but perhaps the correct interpretation is that the duration between their joining is 10 years, regardless of order. But according to the data, it's 11 years apart, so still incorrect.\n\nWait, another thought: Perhaps I made a mistake in looking up the years. Let me check again:\n\nFor winamac:\n- The row is [\"winamac\", \"winamac\", \"warriors\", \"66 pulaski\", \"1947\", \"1972\"]. So year joined is 1947.\n\nFor southwestern:\n- The row is [\"southwestern\", \"lafayette\", \"wildcats\", \"79 tippecanoe\", \"1958\", \"1966\"]. Year joined is 1958.\n\nSo, the difference is 1958 -1947 =11 years. So winamac joined before southwestern by 11 years, not after.\n\nTherefore, the claim that winamac joined 10 years after southwestern is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"winamac join 10 year after southwestern join.\" \n\n- **Winamac** joined in 1947.\n- **Southwestern** joined in 1958.\n\nCalculating the difference: 1958 - 1947 = 11 years. Therefore, winamac joined 11 years before southwestern, not 10 years after. The claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\nThe claim is false because winamac joined in 1947 and southwestern joined in 1958, which is an 11-year difference, not 10 years as stated.",
