    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"On August 13th, 1966, the away team was North Melbourne, while the home team was Collingwood.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", \"away team score\", \"venue\", \"crowd\", and \"date\". Each row represents a game played on August 13th, 1966.\n\nI'll go through each row to find where Collingwood is the home team. Scanning the data:\n\n- Row 0: St Kilda vs South Melbourne\n- Row 1: Essendon vs Fitzroy\n- Row 2: Collingwood vs North Melbourne\n- Rows 3,4,5 are other teams.\n\nSo in row 2, Collingwood is the home team and North Melbourne is the away team. The date for this row is August 13th, 1966 as specified in the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim matches the data exactly: on that specific date, Collingwood was home and North Melbourne was away.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
