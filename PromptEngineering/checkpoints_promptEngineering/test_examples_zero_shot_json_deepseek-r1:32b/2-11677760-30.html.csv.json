I need to determine whether the claim \"shabazz muhammad attend ucla and his hometown be las vega  , nv\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: player, height, school, hometown, college. So each row represents a different player with their respective details.\n\nThe claim has two parts:\n1. Shabazz Muhammad attended UCLA.\n2. His hometown is Las Vegas, NV.\n\nI need to verify both statements against the table data.\n\nLooking at the data rows, I'll search for \"shabazz muhammad\". Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Khem Birch\n- Row 1: Perry Ellis\n- Row 2: Myles Mack\n- Row 3: Shabazz Muhammad\n- Row 4: Cody Zeller\n\nSo, the relevant row is index 3. Now, let's check the columns for this row.\n\nFor the first part of the claim: \"attend ucla\". The college column in row 3 is \"ucla\". So that matches.\n\nFor the second part: \"hometown be las vega , nv\". The hometown column in row 3 says \"las vegas  , nv\". There's a slight variation with an extra space, but it's essentially the same location. Spelling-wise, \"vegas\" vs \"vega\" could be a typo, but considering common usage, it's likely referring to Las Vegas.\n\nBoth parts of the claim are supported by the data in row 3 under columns 'college' and 'hometown'. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"hometown\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the hometown of the player that attend ucla be las vega , nv\".\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table structure. The table has columns named \"player\", \"height\", \"school\", \"hometown\", and \"college\". Each row contains data corresponding to these columns.\n\nThe claim mentions two key pieces of information: \n1. A player attended UCLA.\n2. That player's hometown is Las Vegas, NV.\n\nTo verify this, I need to look through each row of the table for any player who has \"ucla\" listed under the \"college\" column and check their \"hometown\".\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\n- Row 0: Player \"khem birch\", college is \"pittsburgh / unlv\". Not UCLA.\n- Row 1: Player \"perry ellis\", college is \"kansas\". Not UCLA.\n- Row 2: Player \"myles mack\", college is \"rutgers\". Not UCLA.\n- Row 3: Player \"shabazz muhammad\", college is \"ucla\". This matches the first condition.\n- Row 4: Player \"cody zeller\", college is \"indiana\". Not UCLA.\n\nSo, only row index 3 has a player who attended UCLA. Now, checking the \"hometown\" of this player in row 3, it's listed as \"las vegas , nv\".\n\nComparing this to the claim, both conditions are satisfied: the player attended UCLA and their hometown is Las Vegas, NV.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"hometown\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

That matches the first part of the claim.\n- In the \"college\" column (same row), it's written as \"kansas\".

The first part is that Cody Zeller went to Washington High School.
