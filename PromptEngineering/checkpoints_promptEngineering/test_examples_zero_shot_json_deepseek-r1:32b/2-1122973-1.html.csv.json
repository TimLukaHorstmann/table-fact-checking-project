    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"3 drivers complete less than 10 laps\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim states that exactly three drivers completed fewer than 10 laps in the race. To verify this, I need to look at the 'laps' column for each driver and count how many have a lap count less than 10.\n\nLooking through the data rows:\n\n- The first few drivers (Mansell, Prost, Piquet, Senna, Alboreto, Johansson) have laps ranging from 68 to 70. That's way above 10.\n- Moving down, Fabi has 68 laps, Dumfries 68, Boutsen 67, Danner 67, Palmer 67. Still above 10.\n- Allen Berg has 63 laps, Patrese 62, Tambay and Nannini both have 60. These are all well over 10.\n- Berger completed 44 laps, de Cesaris 43, Rosberg 41, Warwick 41. Still above 10.\n- Alliot has 39 laps, Streiff 28, Brundle 18. Now we're getting closer to single digits but still above 10.\n- Jones completed 10 laps exactly. Hmm, the claim is about less than 10, so 10 doesn't count.\n- Rothengatter has 9 laps. That's below 10.\n- Ghinzani has 8 laps, also below 10.\n- Capelli completed 6 laps, which is also below 10.\n\nSo counting the drivers with laps less than 10: Rothengatter (9), Ghinzani (8), and Capelli (6). That's three drivers. \n\nWait, but let me double-check each row to ensure I didn't miss any other entries:\n\nRow indices from 24 onwards:\n- Rothengatter: 9 laps.\n- Ghinzani: 8 laps.\n- Capelli: 6 laps.\n\nYes, those are the only ones with less than 10 laps. Three drivers in total. \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because exactly three drivers completed fewer than 10 laps. The relevant cells are the 'laps' column for rows 24 (Rothengatter), 25 (Ghinzani), and 26 (Capelli).\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"only 3 drivers completed 70 laps\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let's start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe table has columns: driver, constructor, laps, time/retired, and grid. The key column here is \"laps,\" which tells us how many laps each driver completed. The claim says that only three drivers finished 70 laps. So my task is to count how many entries in the \"laps\" column are exactly 70.\n\nLooking at the data, I'll go through each row and check the \"laps\" value. Let's list them out:\n\n1. Nigel Mansell: 70\n2. Alain Prost: 70\n3. Nelson Piquet: 70\n4. Ayrton Senna: 69\n5. Michele Alboreto: 69\n6. Stefan Johansson: 69\n7. Ren\u00e9 Arnoux: 69\n8. Teo Fabi: 68\n9.

The first three entries\u2014Nigel Mansell, Alain Prost, and Nelson Piquet\u2014all have 70 laps each. After that, the next highest is 69, which occurs four times, so none of those contribute to the 70-lap count.\n\nTherefore, only three drivers completed exactly 70 laps. The claim says \"only 3,\" which matches my count. So the answer should be TRUE. \n\nTo support this, I'll note that rows 0, 1, and 2 (assuming index starts at 0) have \"laps\" equal to 70.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"the 2nd and 3rd place driver complete the race within a minute of the 1st place driver.\"\n\nOkay, so I need to identify who the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place drivers are. The table has columns like \"driver\", \"constructor\", \"laps\", \"time / retired\", and \"grid\". From these, it seems that \"grid\" might represent their starting positions, but I'm not sure if that's their finishing position. Wait, actually, in racing contexts, the grid usually refers to the starting grid position, which is different from their finishing position. So, maybe the actual finishing positions aren't directly provided here.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need another approach. The \"laps\" column shows how many laps each driver completed. Since F1 races typically have a certain number of laps, completing more laps might indicate a better finish. But wait, in some cases, drivers can complete fewer laps due to issues but still finish higher if others had more issues.\n\nWait, looking back at the data, I see that the \"laps\" column varies. For example, Nigel Mansell has 70 laps, Alain Prost also 70, Nelson Piquet 70 as well. Then Ayrton Senna and some others have fewer laps. So maybe the number of laps completed can help determine their finishing order.\n\nWait, in F1 races, drivers who finish more laps are likely to have a better position because they're still racing while others might have retired early. So perhaps the top three finishers would be those with the highest number of laps.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Nigel Mansell: 70 laps\n- Alain Prost: 70 laps\n- Nelson Piquet: 70 laps\n\nThey all completed 70 laps, which seems like the most. Then others have fewer laps, so perhaps these three are the top finishers.\n\nWait, but in a race, it's possible that multiple drivers finish on the same lap but with different times. So maybe their finishing order is determined by their \"time / retired\" column.\n\nSo, for the first place driver, we need to find who had the best (earliest) time among those who completed 70 laps.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Nigel Mansell: \"1:37:21.900\"\n- Alain Prost: \"+ 18.772\" which I think means he finished 18.772 seconds behind the leader.\n- Nelson Piquet: \"+ 49.274\" so he's further behind.\n\nSo, assuming that the first place driver is the one with the earliest time, which would be Nigel Mansell since his time isn't a plus, it's an actual time. So Mansell is likely 1st place, Prost is 2nd (18.772 seconds behind), and Piquet is 3rd (49.274 seconds behind).\n\nNow, the claim says that the 2nd and 3rd drivers finished within a minute of the 1st driver.\n\nSo I need to check if both Prost's and Piquet's times are within 60 seconds of Mansell's time.\n\nMansell's time is \"1:37:21.900\". Let me convert that into total seconds for easier calculation.\n\nFirst, break it down:\n\n- Hours: 1\n- Minutes: 37\n- Seconds: 21.9\n\nConvert hours to minutes: 1 hour = 60 minutes, so total minutes are 60 + 37 = 97 minutes.\n\nConvert 97 minutes to seconds: 97 * 60 = 5820 seconds.\n\nAdd the remaining seconds: 5820 + 21.9 = 5841.9 seconds.\n\nNow, Prost's time is \"+ 18.772\" which I assume is in seconds behind Mansell. So his total time would be 5841.9 + 18.772 \u2248 5860.672 seconds.\n\nPiquet's time is \"+ 49.274\", so his total time is 5841.9 + 49.274 \u2248 5891.174 seconds.\n\nNow, check the difference between each of them and Mansell:\n\n- Prost: 5860.672 - 5841.9 = 18.772 seconds behind.\n- Piquet: 5891.174 - 5841.9 \u2248 49.274 seconds behind.\n\nThe claim says they must finish within a minute (60 seconds) of the first place driver. Both Prost and Piquet are well within that time frame\u201418.772 and 49.274 seconds respectively, both less than 60 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells would be:\n\n- For Mansell (row 0): \"time / retired\" to get his time.\n- For Prost (row 1): \"time / retired\" for his time difference.\n- For Piquet (row 2): \"time / retired\" for his time difference.\n\nSo the relevant cells are rows 0, 1, and 2 under the \"time / retired\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the 2nd and 3rd place driver complete the race over 2 minutes away from the first place finishing time.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. It's talking about the finishing times of the drivers who finished in 2nd and 3rd positions compared to the first-place finisher. The claim is that both these drivers finished more than 2 minutes after the first driver.\n\nLooking at the table, I see the columns are \"driver\", \"constructor\", \"laps\", \"time / retired\", and \"grid\". So the relevant column for finishing time is \"time / retired\".\n\nI should identify which drivers are in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places. Typically, in a race, the driver with the lowest grid position (like grid 1) starts first, but the finishing positions can vary. However, since the table isn't sorted by finishing time or laps completed, I need to figure out who finished where based on the data.\n\nWait, actually, in a race, the order of finish is usually determined by who completes the most laps or finishes their laps first. Looking at the \"laps\" column, the driver with 70 laps would be ahead of those with fewer laps. So let's check the drivers with 70 laps:\n\n- Row 0: Nigel Mansell, Williams-Honda, 70 laps, time is 1:37:21.900\n- Row 1: Alain Prost, McLaren-TAG, 70 laps, +18.772\n- Row 2: Nelson Piquet, Williams-Honda, 70 laps, +49.274\n\nSo all three have completed 70 laps, which is the highest in the table. Now, their finishing times are given as \"time / retired\". For the first-place driver, Nigel Mansell has a time of 1:37:21.900. The others have \"+ something\", which I assume means they finished that much behind.\n\nSo Alain Prost is +18.772 seconds, and Nelson Piquet is +49.274 seconds. \n\nThe claim is whether these two (Prost and Piquet) are over 2 minutes (which is 120 seconds) away from Mansell's time.\n\nLet me convert their times to seconds:\n\n- Prost: 18.772 seconds behind\n- Piquet: 49.274 seconds behind\n\nBoth of these are less than 120 seconds, so neither is over 2 minutes behind. Therefore, the claim that both 2nd and 3rd place drivers finished more than 2 minutes after the first place is FALSE.\n\nTo verify this, I need to check the relevant cells:\n\n- For 1st place (Nigel Mansell), row 0, \"time / retired\" column\n- For 2nd place (Alain Prost), row 1, same column\n- For 3rd place (Nelson Piquet), row 2, same column\n\nSo the relevant cells are rows 0,1,2 with column \"time / retired\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this table in JSON format and a claim to verify: \"3 drivers completed less than 9 laps.\" My task is to determine if this claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll need to understand what each column represents. The columns are \"driver\", \"constructor\", \"laps\", \"time / retired\", and \"grid\". Since the claim is about the number of drivers who completed less than 9 laps, I'm particularly interested in the \"laps\" column.\n\nI'll go through each row of data and check the value under the \"laps\" column. Let me list them out:\n\n1. Nigel Mansell: 70 laps\n2. Alain Prost: 70 laps\n3. Nelson Piquet: 70 laps\n4. Ayrton Senna: 69 laps\n5. Michele Alboreto: 69 laps\n6. Stefan Johansson: 69 laps\n7. Ren\u00e9 Arnoux: 69 laps\n8. Teo Fabi: 68 laps\n9. Johnny Dumfries: 68 laps\n10. Thierry Boutsen: 67 laps\n11. Christian Danner: 67 laps\n12. Jonathan Palmer: 67 laps\n13. Allen Berg: 63 laps\n14. Riccardo Patrese: 62 laps\n15. Patrick Tambay: 62 laps\n16. Alessandro Nannini: 60 laps\n17. Gerhard Berger: 44 laps\n18. Andrea de Cesaris: 43 laps\n19. Keke Rosberg: 41 laps\n20. Derek Warwick: 41 laps\n21. Philippe Alliot: 39 laps\n22. Philippe Streiff: 28 laps\n23. Martin Brundle: 18 laps\n24. Alan Jones: 10 laps\n25. Huub Rothengatter: 9 laps\n26. Piercarlo Ghinzani: 8 laps\n27. Ivan Capelli: 6 laps\n\nNow, I'm looking for drivers who have less than 9 laps. Let's see which ones fit that criterion.\n\nLooking at the list:\n- Ivan Capelli has 6 laps.\n- Piercarlo Ghinzani has 8 laps.\n- Huub Rothengatter is noted with 9 laps, but since the claim is \"less than 9,\" 9 doesn't qualify. So only the first two are below 9.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me recount. Starting from the bottom:\n\nRow index 25: Piercarlo Ghinzani has 8 laps.\nRow index 26: Ivan Capelli has 6 laps.\nRow index 24: Huub Rothengatter is at row 24 (since rows are zero-indexed), but looking back, no\u2014wait, the data starts from row 0. So let me correct that.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the rows because when I listed them, it went up to 27 entries, which would mean row indexes go from 0 to 26. Let me adjust:\n\nLooking at each row's \"laps\" value:\n\nRow 0: 70\nRow 1: 70\nRow 2: 70\nRow 3: 69\nRow 4: 69\nRow 5: 69\nRow 6: 69\nRow 7: 68\nRow 8: 68\nRow 9: 67\nRow 10: 67\nRow 11: 67\nRow 12: 63\nRow 13: 62\nRow 14: 62\nRow 15: 60\nRow 16: 44\nRow 17: 43\nRow 18: 41\nRow 19: 41\nRow 20: 39\nRow 21: 28\nRow 22: 18\nRow 23: 10\nRow 24: 9\nRow 25: 8\nRow 26: 6\n\nSo, the rows with laps less than 9 are:\n\n- Row 25: 8 laps (Piercarlo Ghinzani)\n- Row 26: 6 laps (Ivan Capelli)\n\nThat's only two drivers. The claim says three drivers completed less than 9 laps, but according to the data, there are only two.\n\nWait a minute\u2014did I miss any? Let me double-check:\n\nLooking again at each row from index 0 to 26:\n\n- Rows 0-3: all above 50\n- Rows 4-7: same, high numbers.\n- Continue down until Row 22: 18 laps (above 9)\nRow 23: 10 laps (still above 9)\nRow 24: 9 laps (exactly 9, so not less than 9)\nRow 25: 8 laps\nRow 26: 6 laps\n\nSo only two drivers have less than 9 laps. Therefore, the claim of three drivers is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting rows? Let me recount:\n\nTotal rows are 27 (from index 0 to 26). Checking each row's laps:\n\nRow 0: 70\n1:70\n2:70\n3:69\n4:69\n5:69\n6:69\n7:68\n8:68\n9:67\n10:67\n11:67\n12:63\n13:62\n14:62\n15:60\n16:44\n17:43\n18:41\n19:41\n20:39\n21:28\n22:18\n23:10 (which is more than 9)\n24:9 (exactly, so not less)\n25:8\n26:6\n\nSo only rows 25 and 26 are below 9. Therefore, only two drivers.\n\nWait, but the claim says three. So the answer should be FALSE because there's only two such drivers.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that only two drivers completed less than 9 laps (rows 25 and 26). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "claim": "ferrari be the constructor of 3 of the car drive in the race",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"ferrari be the constructor of 3 of the car drive in the race\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that Ferrari was the constructor for three cars that participated in the race. So I need to check how many entries in the \"constructor\" column have \"ferrari\" as their value.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a driver and details about their performance. The relevant columns here are \"driver\", \"constructor\", \"laps\", etc. Specifically, the claim is about the number of times \"ferrari\" appears in the \"constructor\" column.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to count how many constructors are Ferrari:\n\n1. Row 0: Constructor is \"williams - honda\" \u2192 Not Ferrari.\n2. Row 1: Constructor is \"mclaren - tag\" \u2192 Not Ferrari.\n3. Row 2: Constructor is \"williams - honda\" \u2192 Not Ferrari.\n4. Row 3: Constructor is \"lotus - renault\" \u2192 Not Ferrari.\n5. Row 4: Constructor is \"ferrari\" \u2192 Yes, count = 1.\n6. Row 5: Constructor is \"ferrari\" \u2192 Count = 2.\n7. Row 6: Constructor is \"ligier - renault\" \u2192 Not Ferrari.\n8. Row 7: Constructor is \"benetton - bmw\" \u2192 Not Ferrari.\n9. Row 8: Constructor is \"lotus - renault\" \u2192 Not Ferrari.\n10. Row 9: Constructor is \"arrows - bmw\" \u2192 Not Ferrari.\n11. Row 10: Constructor is \"arrows - bmw\" \u2192 Not Ferrari.\n12. Row 11: Constructor is \"zakspeed\" \u2192 Not Ferrari.\n13. Row 12: Constructor is \"osella - alfa romeo\" \u2192 Not Ferrari.\n14. Row 13: Constructor is \"brabham - bmw\" \u2192 Not Ferrari.\n15. Row 14: Constructor is \"lola - ford\" \u2192 Not Ferrari.\n16. Row 15: Constructor is \"minardi - motori moderni\" \u2192 Not Ferrari.\n17. Row 16: Constructor is \"benetton - bmw\" \u2192 Not Ferrari.\n18. Row 17: Constructor is \"minardi - motori moderni\" \u2192 Not Ferrari.\n19. Row 18: Constructor is \"mclaren - tag\" \u2192 Not Ferrari.\n20. Row 19: Constructor is \"brabham - bmw\" \u2192 Not Ferrari.\n21. Row 20: Constructor is \"ligier - renault\" \u2192 Not Ferrari.\n22. Row 21: Constructor is \"tyrrell - renault\" \u2192 Not Ferrari.\n23. Row 22: Constructor is \"lola - ford\" \u2192 Not Ferrari.\n24. Row 23: Constructor is \"zakspeed\" \u2192 Not Ferrari.\n25. Row 24: Constructor is \"osella - alfa romeo\" \u2192 Not Ferrari.\n26. Row 25: Constructor is \"ags - motori moderni\" \u2192 Not Ferrari.\n\nFrom this, I found two entries where the constructor is Ferrari (rows 4 and 5). The claim says three cars were constructed by Ferrari. Since there are only two such instances, the claim isn't fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to list the rows where \"constructor\" was Ferrari. That's row indices 4 and 5, both under the \"constructor\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"2 driver leave the race early because they have engine problem\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that two drivers had to leave the race early due to engine problems.\n\nLooking at the table columns: driver, constructor, laps, time / retired, grid. The key column here is \"time  / retired\" which likely indicates the reason they stopped racing.\n\nI'll go through each row and check if the \"time / retired\" field mentions an engine problem.\n\nRow 0: Nigel Mansell - \"1:37:21.900\". That's a time, so he finished.\nRow 1: Alain Prost - \"+ 18.772\", which is a time difference, so he likely finished.\nRow 2: Nelson Piquet - \"+ 49.274\", also seems to have finished.\nRow 3: Ayrton Senna - \"out of fuel\". He retired because he ran out of fuel, not engine problem.\nRow 4: Michele Alboreto - \"+1 lap\", so he finished a lap behind.\nRow 5: Stefan Johansson - same as above.\nRow 6: Ren\u00e9 Arnoux - \"+1 lap\".\nRow 7: Teo Fabi - \"+2 laps\".\nRow 8: Johnny Dumfries - \"+2 laps\".\nRow 9: Thierry Boutsen - \"+3 laps\".\nRow 10: Christian Danner - \"+3 laps\".\nRow 11: Jonathan Palmer - \"+3 laps\".\nRow 12: Allen Berg - \"+7 laps\".\nRow 13: Riccardo Patrese - \"engine\". Here's one driver who retired due to engine issues.\nRow 14: Patrick Tambay - \"not classified\". Not specified why.\nRow 15: Alessandro Nannini - same as above.\nRow 16: Gerhard Berger - \"spun off\".\nRow 17: Andrea de Cesaris - \"spun off\".\nRow 18: Keke Rosberg - \"electrical\".\nRow 19: Derek Warwick - \"electrical\".\nRow 20: Philippe Alliot - \"engine\". Another one with engine problem.\nRow 21: Philippe Streiff - \"engine\". Wait, that's the third driver with engine issues. But wait, let me recount.\n\nWait, rows 13 (Riccardo Patrese), 20 (Philippe Alliot), and 21 (Philippe Streiff) all have \"engine\" as their reason for retirement. So that's three drivers, not two.\n\nBut the claim says two drivers left early due to engine problems. However, according to this table, there are actually three drivers: Riccardo Patrese at row 13, Philippe Alliot at row 20, and Philippe Streiff at row 21.\n\nWait a second, looking back:\n\nRow 13: \"engine\"\nRow 20: \"engine\" (Philippe Alliot)\nRow 21: \"engine\" (Philippe Streiff)\n\nSo that's three drivers with engine problems. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states two when there are actually three.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me check each row again:\n\nLooking for any cell where \"time / retired\" is \"engine\". \n\n- Row 13: Riccardo Patrese - yes\n- Row 20: Philippe Alliot - yes\n- Row 21: Philippe Streiff - yes\n\nSo that's three instances. Therefore, the claim of two drivers is false; it should be three.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting or misunderstanding who left early. Let me check if all these drivers indeed retired early. \n\nLooking at laps:\n\nRow 13: Riccardo Patrese has 6 laps (I think, but checking row indexes). Wait no, let's look at the actual data:\n\nWait, in the table provided, each row is a driver with their respective data. For example, Row 0 is Nigel Mansell who finished the race as indicated by his time.\n\nSo for engine problems: \n\n- Riccardo Patrese (Row 13): He retired early because of an engine issue.\n- Philippe Alliot (Row 20): Retired due to engine.\n- Philippe Streiff (Row 21): Also engine problem.\n\nThat's three drivers, not two. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in row numbers. Let me recount:\n\nRows are from index 0 to 25. So rows with \"engine\" are:\n\n- Row 13: Riccardo Patrese\n- Row 20: Philippe Alliot\n- Row 21: Philippe Streiff\n\nSo three drivers, which contradicts the claim of two. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nWait, but let me check if any other rows have engine issues:\n\nRow 24: Piercarlo Ghinzani - \"engine\". Wait no, row 24 is actually Ivan Capelli with transmission issue. Wait no, looking back at the table structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to list all the rows where \"time / retired\" is \"engine\":\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 13: Riccardo Patrese - engine\nRow 20: Philippe Alliot - engine\nRow 21: Philippe Streiff - engine\n\nSo that's three drivers. Therefore, the claim of two is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the table provided in the JSON, let me recount:\n\nThe data array has 25 entries (indexes 0-24). So rows are from 0 to 24.\n\nLooking for \"engine\" in the \"time / retired\" column:\n\n- Row 13: Riccardo Patrese\n- Row 20: Philippe Alliot\n- Row 21: Philippe Streiff\n\nWait, row 21 is correct? Let me check the JSON data provided.\n\nIn the JSON, the rows are as follows (only showing relevant parts):\n\nRow 13:\n{\n   \"driver\": \"Riccardo Patrese\",\n   ...\n   \"time / retired\": \"engine\"\n}\n\nRow 20:\n{\n   \"driver\": \"Philippe Alliot\",\n   ...\n   \"time / retired\": \"engine\"\n}\n\nRow 21:\n{\n   \"driver\": \"Philippe Streiff\",\n   ...\n   \"time / retired\": \"engine\"\n}\n\nYes, so three drivers with engine issues.\n\nTherefore, the claim that two drivers left early due to engine problems is FALSE. There are actually three such cases.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that two drivers left the race early because of engine problems. Upon examining the table, we find three instances where drivers retired due to engine issues. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
