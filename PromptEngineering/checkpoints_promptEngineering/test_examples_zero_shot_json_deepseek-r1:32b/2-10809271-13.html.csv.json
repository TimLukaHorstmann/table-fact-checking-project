    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim \"prince park be home to the carlton team\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table structure. The columns are: \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", \"away team score\", \"venue\", \"crowd\", and \"date\". There are six rows of data corresponding to matches played on 14 July 1945.\n\nThe claim mentions two key elements: the venue \"prince park\" and whether it's the home ground for Carlton. So, I need to check if in any row where Carlton is the home team, the venue is Prince Park.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Home team is Essendon, away is Fitzroy \u2013 not relevant.\n2. Row 1: Home team Collingwood vs South Melbourne \u2013 no.\n3. Row 2: Home team Carlton vs Hawthorn. The venue here is \"princes park\". This seems close to the claim but has an extra 's'.\n4. Rows 3-5 don't involve Carlton as the home team.\n\nSo, in row index 2, under \"venue\", it's listed as \"princes park\" instead of \"prince park\". The discrepancy is the 's' in princes vs prince. Since the claim specifies \"prince park\" without the 's', and the table shows \"princes park\", this doesn't exactly match.\n\nTherefore, based on the data provided, there's no row where Carlton is at home at a venue named \"prince park\". The closest match has an extra 's', which changes the name. Hence, the claim isn't fully supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to Prince Park as the home ground of Carlton. Checking the table:\n\n- In row 2, Carlton is the home team and the venue is listed as \"princes park\".\n\nThe venue doesn't exactly match \"prince park\" due to the extra 's'. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. Identify the relevant columns: \"home team\", \"venue\".\n2. Locate rows where \"carlton\" is the home team \u2013 found in row 2.\n3. Check the venue for that row: it's \"princes park\", not \"prince park\".\n4. Since there's a discrepancy, the claim isn't fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
