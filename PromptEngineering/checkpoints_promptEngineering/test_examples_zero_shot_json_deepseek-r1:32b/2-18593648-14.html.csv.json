    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"2 of the artist get a double digit percent vote\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the JSON data. The columns are \"draw,\" \"artist,\" \"song,\" \"televote / sms,\" and \"place.\" The relevant information for this claim is in the \"televote / sms\" column since it indicates the percentage each artist received via televoting or SMS.\n\nNext, I'll go through each row to check if the \"televote / sms\" value is a double-digit percentage. That means any percentage 10% or higher counts as a double digit.\n\nRow 0: Stefan Ilchev has 2.95%. That's single-digit.\nRow 1: Moto has 0.37%. Also single-digit.\nRow 2: Poli Genova has 11.74%. This is a double-digit percentage, so that's one artist.\nRow 3: Danny Milev has 2.39%. Single-digit.\nRow 4: Ivelina has 2.53%. Still single-digit.\nRow 5: Grafa has 3.91%. Single-digit.\nRow 6: Sahara has 3.20%. Single-digit.\nRow 7: Mariana Popova has 8.45%. That's still single-digit because it's below 10%.\nRow 8: Jura Tone feat Lady B has 2.03%. Single-digit.\nRow 9: Stefan Dobrev has 1.16%. Single-digit.\nRow 10: Krassimir Avramov has 55.52%. Definitely a double-digit, so that's the second artist.\nRow 11: Nora has 5.75%. Still single-digit.\n\nSo, only two artists\u2014Poli Genova and Krassimir Avramov\u2014have double-digit percentages in their televote/SMS votes. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI'll note down the relevant cells for each of these entries to support my conclusion.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that two artists received a double-digit percentage vote. Looking at the \"televote / sms\" column:\n\n- Poli Genova has 11.74% (Row 2)\n- Krassimir Avramov has 55.52% (Row 10)\n\nBoth are above 10%, so the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the JSON data given. The table has columns: draw, artist, song, televote / sms, and place. The relevant information for the claim will be in the \"artist\" column since we're dealing with artists' names.\n\nThe claim states that there are 5 artists who only have one name. That means each of these artists should have a single word as their name without any spaces or additional names.\n\nI'll go through each row and check the artist's name to see if it consists of just one word.\n\n1. Row 0: \"stefan ilchev\" - This has two parts, so not a single name.\n2. Row 1: \"moto\" - Only one word, so this counts.\n3. Row 2: \"poli genova\" - Two words again.\n4. Row 3: \"danny milev\" - Two words.\n5. Row 4: \"ivelina\" - Single name, count increases to 2.\n6. Row 5: \"grafa\" - Another single name, now 3.\n7. Row 6: \"sahara\" - Single name, making it 4.\n8. Row 7: \"mariana popova\" - Two words.\n9. Row 8: \"jura tone feat lady b\" - Multiple parts, definitely more than one word.\n10.

Row 11: \"nora\" - Single name, bringing the total to 5.\n\nWait, I just realized that in my initial count, rows 1,4,5,6, and 11 have single names. That's five artists. So, does that mean the claim is TRUE?\n\nHold on a second. Let me double-check each one:\n\n- Row 1: \"moto\" - Yes, one word.\n- Row 4: \"ivelina\" - One word.\n- Row5: \"grafa\" - One word.\n- Row6: \"sahara\" - One word.\n- Row11: \"nora\" - One word.\n\nThat's five artists. But I'm a bit confused because in my first pass, I thought of row 8 as having more than one name, which it does, so it doesn't count. So the total is indeed five.\n\nWait another thing\u2014what about row 8: \"jura tone feat lady b\"? That's definitely multiple names and features, so it shouldn't be counted.

The claim says, \"first place get 55.52 percent of the vote, and last place get 0.37 percent of the vote.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify what defines first and last places in the table. Looking at the columns, there's a column named \"place\" which likely indicates the ranking. So, first place would be the row where \"place\" is 1, and last place would be where \"place\" is the highest number, which in this case is 12.\n\nNext, I'll check each part of the claim separately. \n\nStarting with the first part: does first place have 55.52%? Scanning through the rows, when the \"place\" column is 1, the corresponding televote/sms percentage is indeed 55.52%. That's in row index 10.\n\nNow for the second part: last place, which is place 12, has a televote/sms of 0.37%.

So, I'll look at each artist's song and check if it's just one word.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. Row 0: Artist is Stefan Ilchev, Song is \"get up\". That's two words.\n2. Row 1: Artist Moto, Song \"razstoyaniya\". One word.\n3. Row 2: Poli Genova, Song \"one lifetime is not enough\". Multiple words.\n4. Row 3: Danny Milev, Song \"nyama vreme\". Two words.\n5.

The relevant column here is the \"song\" column because the claim is about the song titles containing the word 'love'.\n\nI'll go through each row's song title to check for occurrences of the word 'love'. Let me list out the songs:\n\n1. Row 0: \"get up\" - No mention of love.\n2. Row 1: \"razstoyaniya\" - Doesn't contain love.\n3. Row 2: \"one lifetime is not enough\" - No love here.\n4. Row 3: \"nyama vreme\" - Doesn't include love.\n5. Row 4: \"ready for love\" - This one has 'love' in it. That's the first occurrence.\n6. Row 5: \"vrag\" - No love.\n7. Row 6: \"don't kiss for the money\" - Doesn't contain love.\n8. Row 7: \"crazy\" - No love here.\n9. Row 8: \"chance to love you\" - This has 'love' as well. That's the second occurrence.\n10. Row 9: \"everlasting\" - No mention of love.\n11. Row 10: \"illusion\" - Doesn't include love.\n\nWait, actually, let me recount because I might have miscounted earlier. \n\nRow 4 is \"ready for love\" which includes 'love' once. Then, row 8 is \"chance to love you\", which also includes 'love'. That's two instances of the word 'love' in song titles.\n\nWait a second, let me check each song title again carefully:\n\n- Row 0: get up \u2192 no\n- Row 1: razstoyaniya \u2192 no\n- Row 2: one lifetime is not enough \u2192 no\n- Row 3: nyama vreme \u2192 no\n- Row 4: ready for love \u2192 yes (love appears once)\n- Row 5: vrag \u2192 no\n- Row 6: don't kiss for the money \u2192 no\n- Row 7: crazy \u2192 no\n- Row 8: chance to love you \u2192 yes (love appears again)\n- Rows 9,10,11: none contain 'love'\n\nSo that's two songs where 'love' is part of the title.

The goal is to determine whether the claim \"5 of the artist score under 2%\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the table represents. Looking at the columns: draw, artist, song, televote/sms, place. So, for each row, we have information about an artist's performance in a competition, including their vote percentage and their placement.\n\nThe claim is about how many artists scored under 2%. Specifically, it says five artists did so. To verify this, I need to look at the \"televote / sms\" column for each artist because that represents their score or percentage of votes they received.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Stefan Ilchev: 2.95% \u2013 This is above 2%, so he doesn't count.\n2. Moto: 0.37% \u2013 Below 2%, counts towards the claim.\n3. Poli Genova: 11.74% \u2013 Way above, so no.\n4. Danny Milev: 2.39% \u2013 Slightly above 2%, doesn't count.\n5. Ivelina: 2.53% \u2013 Again, just over 2%, so not counted.\n6. Graf a: 3.91% \u2013 Above, so nope.\n7. Sahara: 3.20% \u2013 Also above.\n8. Mariana Popova: 8.45% \u2013 Definitely above.\n9. Jura Tone feat Lady B: 2.03% \u2013 Hmm, this is just over 2%, but wait\u2014the claim says \"under 2%.\" Since it's 2.03, which is more than 2%, does that count? I think not; under means strictly less than.\n10. Stefan Dobrev: 1.16% \u2013 This is below 2%, counts.\n11. Krassimir Avramov: 55.52% \u2013 Way above.\n12. Nora: 5.75% \u2013 Above as well.\n\nSo, looking at the scores:\n\n- Moto: 0.37%\n- Stefan Dobrev: 1.16%\n\nWait, that's only two artists scoring under 2%. The claim says five, but I'm only finding two. Maybe I missed something. Let me double-check each row again carefully.\n\nGoing back through each artist's percentage:\n\nRow 2 (Moto): 0.37% \u2013 yes.\nRow 10: Stefan Dobrev with 1.16% \u2013 correct.\nOthers are all above or equal to 2%. So, only two artists scored under 2%.\n\nTherefore, the claim that five artists scored under 2% is FALSE. The relevant cells are those where \"televote / sms\" is less than 2%, which are rows 1 and 9 (since row indices start at 0). But wait, in my initial count, I considered row 1 as Moto and row 10 as Stefan Dobrev. However, when counting from 0, row 1 is index 1 (Moto) and row 10 is index 10.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, the data array starts at index 0 for the first entry, which is Stefan Ilchev. So:\n\nRow 0: Stefan Ilchev \u2013 2.95%\nRow 1: Moto \u2013 0.37% (counts)\nRow 2: Poli Genova \u2013 11.74%\n...\nRow 9: Jura Tone feat Lady B \u2013 2.03% (doesn't count because it's over 2%)\nRow 10: Stefan Dobrev \u2013 1.16% (counts)\nRow 11: Nora \u2013 5.75%\n\nSo, the relevant cells are at row indices 1 and 10 under the \"televote / sms\" column.\n\nBut according to my initial count, only two artists scored under 2%, not five.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that there are three artists named Stefan. So, my task is to check the 'artist' column in each row of the table and count how many times \"Stefan\" appears.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: draw, artist, song, televote/sms, and place. The data has 12 rows, each representing an entry from draw number 1 to 12.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one, focusing on the 'artist' column:\n\n- Row 0: Artist is \"stefan ilchev\". That's Stefan.\n- Row 1: Artist is \"moto\". Not Stefan.\n- Row 2: Artist is \"poli genova\". No.\n- Row 3: Artist is \"danny milev\". Nope.\n- Row 4: Artist is \"ivelina\". Doesn't fit.\n- Row 5: Artist is \"grafa\". Not relevant.\n- Row 6: Artist is \"sahara\". Not Stefan.\n- Row 7: Artist is \"mariana popova\". No match.\n- Row 8: Artist is \"jura tone feat lady b\". Not Stefan.\n- Row 9: Artist is \"stefan dobrev\". That's another Stefan.\n- Row 10: Artist is \"krassimir avramov\". Doesn't fit.\n- Row 11: Artist is \"nora\". No.\n\nSo, from this, I found two artists named Stefan: \"Stefan Ilchev\" in row 0 and \"Stefan Dobrev\" in row 9. Wait a minute, that's only two, not three as the claim suggests. Hmm, did I miss any?\n\nLet me double-check each row to make sure I didn't skip any:\n\n- Row 0: Stefan Ilchev \u2013 yes.\n- Rows 1-8: No other Stefans found.\n- Row 9: Stefan Dobrev \u2013 yes.\n- Rows 10-11: No.\n\nSo, only two artists have \"Stefan\" in their names.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"there be a 70 percentage point difference between first and last place\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions a 70 percentage point difference between first and last place. Percentage points refer to absolute differences, so if one value is x% and another is y%, the difference in percentage points is |x - y|.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row has a \"televote / sms\" column which shows percentages. The places are ranked from 1 to 12. So, first place would be the highest rank (place=1) and last place would be the lowest rank (place=12).\n\nLet me identify the relevant rows for first and last places.\n\nFrom the data:\n\n- First place is at row index 10:\n  - Artist: krassimir avramov\n  - Song: illusion\n  - Televote / sms: 55.52%\n  - Place: 1\n\n- Last place is at row index 11:\n  - Wait, looking back, the last row (index 11) has place=4? That doesn't make sense because there are 12 rows with places from 1 to 12. Let me check again.\n\nWait, I might have miscounted. The data array starts at index 0 for draw=1 up to index 11 for draw=12. So place numbers go from 1 (best) to 12 (worst). Therefore:\n\n- First place is row index 10: krassimir avramov with televote/sms 55.52%.\n- Last place would be the entry with place=12, which is at row index 9:\n  - Artist: stefan dobrev\n  - Song: everlasting\n  - Televote / sms: 1.16%\n  - Place: 11? Wait no, wait.\n\nWait, let me list all the places:\n\nRow indices and their place values:\n\n0: place=7\n\n1: place=12\n\n2: place=2\n\n3: place=9\n\n4: place=8\n\n5: place=5\n\n6: place=6\n\n7: place=3\n\n8: place=10\n\n9: place=11\n\n10: place=1\n\n11: place=4\n\nWait, so the places are not in order. The first row (index 0) is draw=1 but placed 7th. The highest place is 1 at index 10, and the lowest place is 12 at index 1.\n\nSo first place is krassimir avramov with 55.52% (row index 10). Last place is stefan dobrev with 1.16% (row index 9).\n\nNow, calculate the difference in percentage points between these two:\n\n55.52 - 1.16 = 54.36 percentage points.\n\nThe claim says a 70 percentage point difference. But here it's only about 54.36, which is less than 70. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if I got the last place right. The table shows places from 1 to 12, so the lowest is 12. Looking back at row indices:\n\nRow index 1: draw=2, artist=moto, place=12. So that's the actual last place with 0.37% televote/sms.\n\nWait a minute! I think I made a mistake earlier. The last place (place=12) is in row index 1:\n\n- Artist: moto\n- Song: razstoyaniya\n- Televote / sms: 0.37%\n- Place: 12\n\nSo, first place is 55.52%, last place is 0.37%. The difference is 55.52 - 0.37 = 55.15 percentage points.\n\nThe claim states a 70% difference, which isn't the case here (55.15 < 70). So the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait again\u2014did I confuse last place? Because row index 9 has place=11, and row index 1 has place=12. So yes, the actual last place is row index 1 with 0.37%.\n\nSo first place: 55.52% (row 10), last place: 0.37% (row 1). Difference is approximately 55.15 percentage points, not 70.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states a 70 percentage point difference between first and last places. From the table:\n\n- First place (place=1): 55.52%\n- Last place (place=12): 0.37%\n\nDifference: 55.52 - 0.37 = 55.15 percentage points, which is less than 70.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the claim \"2 song title be in english\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that two of the song titles are in English. So, my goal is to check each song title in the table and count how many are indeed in English.\n\nLooking at the table structure provided in JSON format, it has columns: \"draw\", \"artist\", \"song\", \"televote / sms\", and \"place\". The relevant column for this claim is \"song\".\n\nI'll go through each row one by one and examine the \"song\" title:\n\n1. Row 0: \"get up\" \u2013 This is in English.\n2. Row 1: \"razstoyaniya\" \u2013 I recognize this as a Bulgarian word, meaning \"separation\". So not English.\n3. Row 2: \"one lifetime is not enough\" \u2013 Clearly an English phrase.\n4. Row 3: \"nyama vreme\" \u2013 This is Bulgarian for \"no time\".\n5. Row 4: \"ready for love\" \u2013 This is in English.\n6. Row 5: \"vrag\" \u2013 Bulgarian for \"devil\".\n7. Row 6: \"don't kiss for the money\" \u2013 English.\n8. Row 7: \"crazy\" \u2013 English.\n9. Row 8: \"chance to love you\" \u2013 English.\n10. Row 9: \"everlasting\" \u2013 English.\n11. Row 10: \"illusion\" \u2013 English.\n12. Row 11: \"it's not right\" \u2013 English.\n\nWait a minute, that seems like more than two songs in English. Let me recount:\n\n- Row 0: English\n- Row 2: English\n- Rows 4 to 11 all have song titles in English as well. That's multiple entries beyond just two.\n\nBut the claim says \"2 song title be in english\". So according to this, it's more than two. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there are more than two songs with English titles.\n\nHowever, I should double-check if perhaps some of these are not actually in English or might be transliterations or something else. For example:\n\n- \"get up\" \u2013 Definitely English.\n- \"one lifetime is not enough\" \u2013 Yes, English.\n- The rest from row 4 onwards all seem to be clear English phrases.\n\nSo yes, there are more than two songs with English titles. Hence, the claim that exactly two song titles are in English is incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells would include all the rows where the song title is in English.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the winner have the longest song title",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the winner have the longest song title\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, who is the winner? Looking at the table, the column 'place' indicates rankings. The lower the number, the better the place. So the row with place 1 should be the winner. Scanning through the data, I see that in row 10 (wait, no, let me count correctly), actually, looking at each row's place:\n\nRow 0: place 7\nRow 1: place 12\nRow 2: place 2\nRow 3: place 9\nRow 4: place 8\nRow 5: place 5\nRow 6: place 6\nRow 7: place 3\nRow 8: place 10\nRow 9: place 11\nRow 10: place 1 (Ah, here it is)\nSo row index 10 has the winner. The artist is \"krassimir avramov\" and the song title is \"illusion\".\n\nNext, I need to check if this song title is indeed the longest in the table. To do that, I should look at all the song titles and compare their lengths.\n\nLet me list all the song titles along with their row indices:\n\nRow 0: \"get up\" (length 7)\nRow 1: \"razstoyaniya\" (length 12)\nRow 2: \"one lifetime is not enough\" (let's count letters: 'one' (3) + 'lifetime' (9) + 'is' (2) + 'not' (3) + 'enough' (6). Wait, but including spaces? So the actual string length. The phrase has 5 words: \"one\", \"lifetime\", \"is\", \"not\", \"enough\". Let's count each character without spaces first: one is 3, lifetime is 9, is is 2, not is 3, enough is 6. Total letters (without spaces) would be 3+9+2+3+6=23. But including the spaces between them, there are 4 spaces, so total length is 23 + 4 = 27 characters.\n\nRow 3: \"nyama vreme\" (counting letters: nyama is 5, vreme is 5; with a space in between, total 11)\nRow 4: \"ready for love\" (length: 'ready' (5) + 'for' (3) + 'love' (4). Total letters without spaces: 5+3+4=12. With two spaces: 14 characters.\nRow 5: \"vrag\" (4)\nRow 6: \"don't kiss for the money\" (let's see: don't is 5, kiss is 4, for is 3, the is 3, money is 5. So letters without spaces: 5+4+3+3+5=19. Spaces between them are 4, so total length 23.\nRow 7: \"crazy\" (5)\nRow 8: \"chance to love you\" ('chance' (6), 'to' (2), 'love' (4), 'you' (3). Letters without spaces: 6+2+4+3=15. Spaces are 3, total length 18.\nRow 9: \"everlasting\" (11)\nRow 10: \"illusion\" (7)\nRow 11: \"it's not right\" ('it's' (4), 'not' (3), 'right' (5). Letters without spaces: 4+3+5=12. Spaces are 2, total length 14.\n\nWait a second, I think I made a mistake here because the claim is about the song title length. So perhaps I should count each song's string length as it appears in the table, including any apostrophes or spaces.\n\nLet me re-express each song title and count their exact lengths:\n\nRow 0: \"get up\" \u2192 7 characters\nRow 1: \"razstoyaniya\" \u2192 12\nRow 2: \"one lifetime is not enough\" \u2192 let's count each character including spaces. The string has 5 words with 4 spaces, so total letters plus spaces: 'one' (3) + space (1) + 'lifetime' (9) + space (1) + 'is' (2) + space (1) + 'not' (3) + space (1) + 'enough' (6). Total: 3+1+9+1+2+1+3+1+6 = 27\nRow 3: \"nyama vreme\" \u2192 5 + 1 + 5 = 11\nRow 4: \"ready for love\" \u2192 'ready' (5) + space + 'for' (3) + space + 'love' (4) \u2192 5+1+3+1+4=14\nRow 5: \"vrag\" \u2192 4\nRow 6: \"don't kiss for the money\" \u2192 let's count each character including apostrophe and spaces. The string is: d o n ' t   k i s s   f o r   t h e   m o n e y \u2192 that's 5 letters in don't (including '), then space, then 4 letters in kiss, space, 3 in for, space, 3 in the, space, and 6 in money. So total: 5 +1 +4 +1 +3 +1 +3 +1 +6 = 25\nRow 7: \"crazy\" \u2192 5\nRow 8: \"chance to love you\" \u2192 'chance' (6) + space + 'to' (2) + space + 'love' (4) + space + 'you' (3). So total: 6+1+2+1+4+1+3=18\nRow 9: \"everlasting\" \u2192 11\nRow 10: \"illusion\" \u21927\nRow 11: \"it's not right\" \u2192 'it's' (4) + space + 'not' (3) + space + 'right' (5). So total:4+1+3+1+5=14\n\nSo now, compiling the lengths:\n\n- Row0:7\n- Row1:12\n- Row2:27\n- Row3:11\n- Row4:14\n- Row5:4\n- Row6:25\n- Row7:5\n- Row8:18\n- Row9:11\n- Row10:7\n- Row11:14\n\nSo the longest song title is in row 2 with a length of 27 characters. The winner is \"one lifetime is not enough\".\n\nTherefore, the song title in row 10 (\"illusion\") has a length of 7, which is much shorter than others like row1's 12 and row2's 27.\n\nWait, but wait! The user asked about whether the winning song (the one by row10) is indeed the longest. But according to this analysis, row2's title is longer. So that would mean that \"illusion\" is not the longest; in fact, it's shorter than several others.\n\nTherefore, if the question was whether \"You are tasked with determining if the winning song ' illusion' is indeed the longest\", then based on this analysis, the answer is no.\n\nBut looking back at the original task:\n\n\"You are tasked with determining if the winning song ' illusion' is indeed the longest.\"\n\nWait, but in my count above, row10's song \"illusion\" has length 7. There are several longer ones like row2 (27), row6 (25), and others.\n\nSo to answer the task: no, \"illusion\" is not the longest; there are other songs with longer titles.\n</think>\n\nThe winning song titled \"illusion\" is not the longest one in the list. The song \"one lifetime is not enough\" has a significantly longer title, making it the longest among all entries.\n\n**Answer:** No, the winning song \"illusion\" is not the longest; the longest title belongs to another song.",
