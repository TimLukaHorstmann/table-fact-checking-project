    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if the claim \"in stanley the bridge be of the concrete deck girder style\" is true based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The location mentioned is Stanley, and the type of bridge is a concrete deck girder. So, I need to check if there's a bridge in Stanley that matches this description.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different bridge with various attributes like Name, Listed, Location (City), County, and Structure Type. I'll scan through each row to find any entries where the City is Stanley.\n\nScanning through the rows:\n\nRow 19: \"sorlie memorial bridge\" - Location is Grand Forks.\nRow 20: \"viking bridge\" - Location is Portland.\nRow 21: \"west antelope bridge\" - Location is Flora.\nRow 22: \"west park bridge\" - Location is Valley City.\nRow 23: \"westgaard bridge\" - Location is Voltaire.\n\nHmm, I don't see any entry with Stanley as the location. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me go back through all the rows again carefully.\n\nWait a minute, row index starts at 0, so let's recount:\n\nRow 0: Blanchard Bridge in Blanchard.\nRow 1: Goose River Bridge in Hillsboro.\nRow 2: Liberty Memorial Bridge in Bismarck.\nRow 3: Porter Elliott Bridge in Hillsboro.\nRow 4: Portland Park Bridge - removed, location Portland.\nRow 5: Rainbow Arch Bridge in Valley City.\n\nNo Stanley there. Wait, maybe I overlooked it earlier. Let me check all rows again.\n\nLooking through each row's Location (City) column:\n\n- Row 0: Blanchard\n- Row 1: Hillsboro\n- Row 2: Bismarck\n- Row 3: Hillsboro\n- Row 4: Portland\n- Row 5: Valley City\n\nNone of these are Stanley. So, it seems there's no bridge listed in the table located in Stanley.\n\nSince there's no bridge in Stanley mentioned, the claim can't be supported by the data provided. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there is a concrete deck girder style bridge in Stanley. Upon reviewing all rows in the table, none of them have \"Stanley\" as their location.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table data. The claim says: \"in colton's cross the bridge be a pratt through truss bridge.\" Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim correctly. It seems like there might be some typos or misspellings. \"Colton's cross\" likely refers to \"Colton's Cross,\" which could be a location. The phrase \"the bridge be a pratt through truss bridge\" is probably stating that the bridge in question is of that type.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several rows with different bridges listed. My task is to find if there's a bridge named something like \"Colton's Cross Bridge\" and check its type.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to look for any mention of Colton or Colton's. Scanning row 0: \"blanchard bridge\" \u2013 nope. Row 1: \"goose river bridge\" \u2013 not it. Row 2: \"liberty memorial bridge\" \u2013 no. Row 3: \"porter elliott bridge\" \u2013 still nothing. \n\nWait, let me check again more carefully. Oh! I see in row 3 (index 3), the bridge is named \"portland park bridge.\" No, that's not it either. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong rows.\n\nHold on, let me go through each row step by step:\n\nRow 0: Blanchard Bridge \u2013 no.\nRow 1: Goose River Bridge \u2013 nope.\nRow 2: Liberty Memorial Bridge \u2013 no.\nRow 3: Porter Elliott Bridge \u2013 not matching.\nRow 4: Portland Park Bridge \u2013 nope.\nRow 5: Rainbow Arch Bridge \u2013 no.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a row. Let me go back to the top.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 0: Blanchard Bridge\nRow 1: Goose River Bridge\nRow 2: Liberty Memorial Bridge\nRow 3: Porter Elliott Bridge\nRow 4: Portland Park Bridge\nRow 5: Rainbow Arch Bridge\n\nHmm, none of these seem to match Colton's Cross. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Perhaps \"Colton's cross\" refers to a bridge named \"Colton's Cross Bridge.\" Let me check each row again.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nWait, perhaps it's in the earlier part of the table. Let me look back at the data provided.\n\nLooking at the list from the top, row indices start at 0. \n\nRow 3: Porter Elliott Bridge \u2013 no.\nRow 4: Portland Park Bridge \u2013 nope.\nRow 5: Rainbow Arch Bridge \u2013 no.\nWait, I might have skipped some rows. Let me recount the rows properly.\n\nActually, looking back, the table starts with \"blanchard bridge\" as row 24 (assuming initial data has 26 rows), but perhaps I miscounted earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to a specific bridge in a certain location named Colton's Cross. Let me check each row for any mention of 'Colton' or similar.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nRow 0: Blanchard Bridge \u2013 location is Blanchard, Traill.\nRow 1: Goose River Bridge \u2013 Hillsboro, Traill.\nRow 2: Liberty Memorial Bridge \u2013 Bismarck, Burleigh.\nRow 3: Porter Elliott Bridge \u2013 Hillsboro, Traill.\nRow 4: Portland Park Bridge \u2013 Portland, Traill.\nRow 5: Rainbow Arch Bridge \u2013 Valley City, Barnes.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong part. Let me check all rows:\n\nActually, row indices might be higher than that since the table has more data. Wait, maybe I should list out all the bridge names and their types to find Colton's Cross.\n\nLet me go through each row again:\n\nRow 0: Blanchard Bridge \u2013 type: Pratt Through Truss\nRow 1: Goose River Bridge \u2013 type: Pratt Through Truss\nRow 2: Liberty Memorial Bridge \u2013 type: Warren-Turner Through Truss\nRow 3: Porter Elliott Bridge \u2013 type: Warren Through Truss\nRow 4: Portland Park Bridge \u2013 removed, type: Steel Through Girder\nRow 5: Rainbow Arch Bridge \u2013 removed, type: Marsh Rainbow Arch\n\nWait, I'm not seeing any bridge named \"Colton's Cross.\" Maybe it's in another part of the table. Let me check all rows again.\n\nUpon reviewing the entire list, I realize that none of the bridges listed have a name similar to Colton's Cross. The closest might be row 3 (Porter Elliott Bridge) and row 1 (Goose River Bridge), but neither matches the claim.\n\nTherefore, since there's no bridge named \"Colton's Cross\" in the table, the claim cannot be supported by the data provided. So, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the bridge at Colton's Cross is a Pratt Through Truss Bridge. After reviewing all rows in the provided table, no bridge with the name or location \"Colton's Cross\" was found. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified as true based on the given data.\n\n**Answer: FALSE**\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim**: The claim is about a bridge at \"Colton's Cross\" being a Pratt Through Truss Bridge.\n2. **Review the Table**: Scan each row to find any mention of \"Colton's Cross.\"\n3. **Check Bridge Names and Locations**: None of the bridges listed have a name or location matching \"Colton's Cross.\"\n4. **Conclusion**: Since no such bridge exists in the table, the claim is unsupported.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe claim is false because there is no bridge named \"Colton's Cross\" in the provided data.",

Scanning through the rows, each entry has a 'Location' column which likely corresponds to the city or area. \n\nI start from row 0 and go down. Row 19 catches my attention because it mentions \"Cooperstown\" under the 'Location' column. Let me check that again. Yes, row 19: Location is Cooperstown.\n\nNext, I need to verify the type of bridge. The claim says it's a \"pratt through truss type\". Looking at the 'Type' column for row 19, it specifies \"pratt through truss\".\n\nSo both conditions are met here\u2014Cooperstown has an entry in the table and that entry is of the pratt through truss type.

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It seems like it's asking whether the Nesheim Bridge is located in McVille.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table entries to find any row where the bridge name is \"nesheim bridge\". Scanning down the list of bridges, I see that there are a lot of them, but one stands out: at row index 17, the bridge is listed as \"nesheim bridge\".\n\nNow, checking the relevant columns. The claim is about the location, so I need to look at the \"Location\" column for this row. Wait, looking back at the table structure, the columns are 'Name', 'Listed', 'City', 'County', and 'Type'. So actually, the city information would be in the third column, which is labeled as 'City'.\n\nSo for row 17, the relevant cells are:\n- The \"Name\" cell to confirm it's the Nesheim Bridge.\n- The \"City\" cell to check if it's McVille.\n\nLooking at row 17, under \"City\", the value is \"mcville\".

This bridge is currently under construction because of structural issues.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each row for entries related to mcville and the Goose River Bridge.\n\nStarting with mcville: Scanning through the rows, I notice that in row 14 (index 14), the location is \"mcville\" for the West Antelope Bridge. However, the claim mentions \"goose river bridge,\" not West Antelope. So mcville does exist in the table but isn't linked to a Goose River Bridge.\n\nNext, searching for Goose River Bridge: I find it in row 24 (index 24).

Let's break down the components:\n\n1. **Bridge Name**: Westgaard Bridge\n2. **Type**: Pratt Pony Through Truss\n3. **County**: Traill\n\nI'll start by looking for the row that contains \"Westgaard Bridge\" in the 'Name' column.

So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nHold on, perhaps I misread the county name. Looking again: the row with Westgaard Bridge is at index 24, and under 'County', it's listed as mchenry. That seems correct. So according to this data, Westgaard Bridge is in McHenry County, not Traill County.\n\nBut wait, let me check other bridges in Traill County just to make sure I'm not confusing anything. For example, row index 3 has a bridge named \"Viking Bridge\" in Traill County, and others like \"Norwegian Brook Bridge\" at index 10.
