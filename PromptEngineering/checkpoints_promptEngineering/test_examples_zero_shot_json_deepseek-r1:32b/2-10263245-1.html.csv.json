The claim says: \"the match against lucian bute be 1 of the 5 fight that librado andrade lose.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what this means. The claim is stating two things:\n1. Librado Andrade lost a match against Lucian Bute.\n2. This loss was one of five fights he lost.\n\nSo, I need to check if there are any losses by Librado Andrade in the table and see how many times he lost. \n\nLooking at the table data provided, each row represents a fight outcome for Librado Andrade. The first column shows whether it's a \"win\" or \"loss.\" \n\nI'll go through each row to find any entries where the outcome is a loss. Let's check them one by one.\n\nRow 0: Outcome is \"win\". Not relevant.\nRow 1: \"win\".\n...\nContinuing this way, I see that all rows indicate \"win\" in the first column. There are no entries where the outcome is \"loss.\" \n\nSince there are zero losses recorded for Librado Andrade in this table, he didn't lose any fights, let alone five. Therefore, the claim that Lucian Bute's match was one of five losses is false because there are no losses listed at all.\n\nAdditionally, I don't see a row where the opponent is Lucian Bute. So even if there were losses, it doesn't appear in the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE as there are no losses recorded for Librado Andrade against Lucian Bute or any other opponents in the provided table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"librado andrade win the fight against otis grant but lose the fight against mikkel kessler.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check if Librado Andrade has a fight with Otis Grant where he won. Looking through the data, I search for any row where \"Opponent\" is Otis Grant. Scanning the table:\n\n- Row 0: Opponent is Shannon Miller\n- Row 1: Opponent is Paulie Malignaggi\n- ...\n- Row 28: Opponent is Ruben Perez\n- Row 29: Opponent is Jimmie Hagar\n- Row 30: Opponent is Harold Lowe\n- ... and so on.\n\nI go through each row, but I don't find any entry where the opponent is Otis Grant. So there's no record of a fight between Librado Andrade and Otis Grant in this table. Therefore, the first part of the claim isn't supported by the data.\n\nNext, I check if he lost against Mikkel Kessler. Scanning for Mikkel Kessler as an opponent:\n\n- Row 15: Opponent is Mikkel Kessler\n- The \"Result\" column shows \"Loss\"\n\nSo in this case, Librado Andrade did lose to Mikkel Kessler. This part of the claim is supported.\n\nHowever, since the first part (winning against Otis Grant) isn't confirmed and there's no such fight recorded, the entire claim can't be fully supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim has two parts: winning against Otis Grant and losing against Mikkel Kessler.

The claim is \"librado andrade never win the fight against paul jones.\" I need to check if this is true or false based on the provided data table.\n\nFirst, I should look through each row in the data to see if there's a fight between Librado Andrade and Paul Jones. The table lists various fights with details like date, result, opponent, etc. Each row has columns: Date, Result, Opponent, Round Method, Time.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Row 0: Opponent is Shannon Miller. Not Paul Jones.\n2. Row 1: Opponent is Jim Hagar. No.\n3. Row 2: Opponent is Harold Lowe. No.\n4. Row 3: Opponent is Eric Benito Tzand. No.\n5.

But the claim says he never won. So according to the data, the claim would be false because there's at least one instance where Andrade defeated Jones.\n\nI should also check if there are any other fights between them in case of multiple matches, but looking through the rest:\n\n10. Row 9: Opponent is George Johnson. No.\n...\nContinuing until the end, I don't see any more Paul Jones opponents. So only one fight where Andrade won.\n\nTherefore, since there's a record of him winning against Paul Jones, the claim that he never did is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The closest I find is a win against Pat Lawlor in 2002, but that's not related to Otis Grant.\n\nNext, checking if he wins against Mikkel Kessler. Looking for any row where the opponent is Mikkel Kessler. I find a fight on August 17, 2001, where Librado Andrade wins by KO in the fourth round. Wait, no\u2014the table shows the opponent as Mikkel Kessler? Let me double-check. Oh, actually, looking again, the fights listed don't include Mikkel Kessler either. The closest is a fight against Pat Lawlor and others, but no Mikkel Kessler.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misreading. Let me go through each row carefully:\n\nLooking at all rows, I see opponents like Pat Lawlor, George Johnson, Paul Jones, Terry Smith, Bernard Temple, Marcus Harvey, Sheridan Page, Eric Benito Tzand, Harold Lowe, Jimmy Hagar, Ruben Perez, Shannon Miller, Juan Carlos Barreto, Eric Benito Tzand again, Shannon Miller, etc., but I don't see either Otis Grant or Mikkel Kessler as opponents. \n\nTherefore, since there's no record of fights against these two fighters in the table, the claim can't be fully supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to two specific fights involving Librado Andrade: one loss against Otis Grant and a win against Mikkel Kessler.

So I need to check if in the table, there's only one row where he lost against Lucian Bute and no other losses elsewhere.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a match with columns: date, opponent, result, method, round, time. The result can be either 'win' or 'loss'. So I need to look for rows where the result is 'loss' and see if the only such row is against Lucian Bute.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Opponent is Juan Carlos Chavez, Result is Win\nRow 1: Opponent is Lucian Bute, Result is Loss (this is one loss)\nRow 2: Opponent is Daniel Gebrish, Result is Win\nRow 3: Opponent is Vic Darchinyan, Result is Loss (another loss here)\n\nWait a minute, row 3 shows a loss against Vic Darchinyan.

The order is important here\u2014the claim states that the fight with Terry Smith happened before the one with Marcus Harvey.\n\nNow, I'll check the data table for any entries related to these names. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. **Terry Smith Fight**: Scanning the \"Opponent\" column, I find a row where the opponent is \"terry smith\". The date for this fight is \"2000-04-13\".\n\n2. **Marcus Harvey Fight**: Next, looking for entries with \"marcus harvey\" as the opponent, there are two rows:\n   - One on \"2000-08-17\"\n   - Another on \"1999-08-14\"\n\nWait a minute, that's interesting. The fight against Terry Smith is in 2000, while one of the Marcus Harvey fights is earlier in 1999. So according to this data, Librado Andrade fought Marcus Harvey first in 1999 and then Terry Smith in 2000.

So, the task is to determine whether the claim \"the most recent fight that Librado Andrade won be on 2011-08-27\" is true or false based on the provided table data. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that the most recent win by Librado Andrade occurred on August 27, 2011. My job is to check this against the data in the table and see if it's supported.\n\nLooking at the structure of the data, it's a JSON object with a \"table\" key that contains an array of rows, each representing a fight. Each row has five columns: \"Opponent\", \"Result\", \"Round\", \"Time\", and \"Date\". \n\nTo verify the claim, I need to find all the fights where Librado Andrade won, then check if the most recent one is indeed on 2011-08-27.\n\nFirst step: Identify all rows where the result was a win. The \"Result\" column in each row tells us whether it's a Win or Loss. So I'll go through each row and pick those where Result is \"Win\".\n\nLet me list out the rows with \"Result\": \"Win\". \n\nLooking at the table data, here are the relevant rows:\n\nRow 0: Opponent \"Efrain Esparza\", Result \"Loss\" \u2192 Not a win.\nRow 1: Opponent \"Bobby Price\", Result \"Loss\" \u2192 Not a win.\nRow 2: Opponent \"Rene Rosado\", Result \"Win\".

Let me recount more carefully. The table has 45 rows (indices 0 to 44). Each row represents a fight. \n\nNow, focusing on the wins:\n\nRow 2: Win vs Rene Rosado - Date 2013-06-08\nRow 5: Win vs Santana Arroyo - 2010-05-29\nRow 6: Win vs Jair Rojas - 2009-12-12\nRow 8: Win vs Ivann Zhakupov - 2009-06-13\nRow 9: Win vs Gunnar Nielsen - 2009-04-07\nRow 12: Win vs Ricardo Lozano - 2008-03-29\nRow 17: Win vs Javier Matamoros - 2006-11-18\nRow 18: Win vs Jesse Delgado - 2006-03-25\nRow 22: Win vs Vicente Buitrago - 2005-09-17\nRow 24: Win vs Danniel Velez - 2005-06-18\nRow 27: Win vs Dennys Giraldo - 2004-11-27\nRow 29: Win vs Rafael Maldonado - 2004-10-02\nRow 32: Win vs Jesmar Mora - 2004-06-05\nRow 34: Win vs Danniel Velez - 2004-05-15\nRow 37: Win vs Danniel Velez - 2004-04-17\nRow 39: Win vs Javier Matamoros - 2004-04-10\nRow 42: Win vs Javier Matamoros - 2003-12-13\nRow 44: Win vs Jesmar Mora - 2003-11-15\n\nSo, the most recent win is row 2 with date 2013-06-08 against Rene Rosado. \n\nBut the claim says the most recent win was on 2011-08-27. However, according to the data, the latest win is in June 2013, which is after August 2011. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because there's a more recent win than the one mentioned.\n\nWait a second, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check the rows again. \n\nLooking back at row 2: It says Opponent \"Rene Rosado\", Result \"Win\", Date \"2013-06-08\". So that's definitely after 2011. Therefore, the most recent win is in 2013, not 2011. \n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread the opponent or the date? Let me check again.\n\nRow 2: Rene Rosado, Win, 2013-06-08\nYes, that's correct. So there are wins after 2011, meaning the claim is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a typo and meant another fighter or perhaps the data provided is incorrect. But based on the given data, the most recent win is in 2013.\n</think>\n\nThe most recent win listed in the data occurs on June 8, 2013, against Rene Rosado.
