    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"jabaquara lost 14 games and have 57 against\" is true, we need to verify two aspects of the claim: the number of losses and the goals conceded (referred to as \"against\") for Jabaquara.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Team in the Table**:\n   - We look through the table to find the row corresponding to the team \"jabaquara\".\n\n2. **Check the Number of Losses**:\n   - According to Row 11, for the team jabaquara:\n     - The column `lost` shows a value of 14.\n   - This confirms that Jabaquara lost 14 games.\n\n3. **Check Goals Conceded (\"against\")**:\n   - In the same row (Row 11), the column `against` shows a value of 57.\n   - This indicates that Jabaquara has conceded 57 goals.\n\n4. **Compare with the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that jabaquara lost 14 games and have 57 against.\n   - Both conditions match exactly with the values from Row 11 in the table.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Since both parts of the claim are verified to be correct based on the data in Row 11, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified Jabaquara's row (Row 11) and confirmed 'lost' as 14 and 'against' as 57.
