    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Minas Gerais lost the most games in total\" is true or false, we need to compare the number of losses for each team listed in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The column that provides information about the number of games lost by each team is the \"lost\" column.\n\n2. **Extract Data from Table**:\n   - Row 1: Minas Gerais has 10 losses.\n   - Row 2: Palestra It\u00e1lia - SP has 3 losses.\n   - Row 3: S\u00edrio has 3 losses.\n   - Row 4: Paulistano has 6 losses.\n   - Row 5: AA das Palmeiras has 7 losses.\n   - Row 6: Ypiranga - SP has 8 losses.\n   - Row 7: Minas Gerais (again) has 10 losses. This confirms the earlier data point as there is no other team with this name in the table.\n   - Row 8: AA S\u00e3o Bento has 11 losses.\n\n3. **Compare Losses**:\n   - We need to find out which team has the highest number of losses.\n   - From the extracted data:\n     - Minas Gerais lost 10 games.\n     - Ypiranga - SP lost 8 games.\n     - Paulistano lost 6 games.\n     - AA das Palmeiras lost 7 games.\n     - S\u00edrio and Palestra It\u00e1lia - SP each lost 3 games.\n     - AA S\u00e3o Bento lost 11 games.\n\n4. **Determine the Team with Most Losses**:\n   - The team with the most losses is AA S\u00e3o Bento with 11 losses, not Minas Gerais.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since Minas Gerais did not have the highest number of losses, the claim that \"Minas Gerais lost the most games in total\" is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 6 (Minas Gerais): `{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}`\n- Row 8 (AA S\u00e3o Bento): `{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the column that shows the number of games lost by each team.\",\n    \"Extract the 'lost' values for all teams from the table.\",\n    \"Compare these values to find the maximum number of losses.\",\n    \"Determine which team has the highest number of losses.\",\n    \"Conclude whether Minas Gerais had the most losses.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
