    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"more than 2 goaltenders were selected between picks 43 and 63\" is true or false, we need to identify all players listed as goaltenders within these pick numbers from the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Range:**\n   - The relevant range of picks is from 43 to 63.\n\n2. **Locate Goaltender Positions:**\n   - We are looking for entries where the \"position\" column indicates \"goaltender.\"\n\n3. **Examine Each Row in the Specified Range:**\n   - Check each row from pick 43 to pick 63 and note if the position is a goaltender.\n\n4. **List of Rows with Goaltenders:**\n   - **Row 9:** Pick 51, Player: Patrick Roy, Position: Goalkeeper (This is a goaltender).\n   - **Row 14:** Pick 56, Player: Alan Perry, Position: Goalkeeper (This is also a goaltender).\n\n5. **Count the Number of Goaltenders:**\n   - We identified 2 players with the position \"goaltender\" within picks 43 to 63.\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that more than 2 goaltenders were selected.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the philadelphia flyer make 6 pick in the range show\" is true or false, we need to interpret the statement correctly. It appears to suggest that the Philadelphia Flyers made six draft picks within a certain range of numbers. However, without specifying what \"range show\" refers to, let's assume it means the first round (positions 1-60), which are generally considered in the NHL draft context.\n\nHere are the steps I will follow:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim is about the Philadelphia Flyers making six picks within a specified range.\n2. **Identify Relevant Data Points**:\n   - We need to identify all the rows where the \"nhl team\" is \"philadelphia flyers\".\n   - Check if these picks fall within the assumed range of 1-60.\n\n3. **Extract Relevant Information from the Table**:\n   - Look for entries with \"nhl team: philadelphia flyers\".\n\n4. **Verify the Number of Picks**:\n   - Count how many such entries exist and ensure they are within the pick numbers 1-60.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Determine if there are indeed six picks by the Philadelphia Flyers in the specified range.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the table:\n\n1. **Row Identification**:\n   - Row 1: \"nhl team\" is \"philadelphia flyers\", pick number is 43.\n   - Row 5: \"nhl team\" is \"philadelphia flyers\", pick number is 47.\n\n2. **Count and Verify**:\n   - We have identified two picks by the Philadelphia Flyers (rows 1 and 5).\n   - Both pick numbers, 43 and 47, fall within the range of 1-60.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The Philadelphia Flyers made only 2 picks in the specified range.\n   - Therefore, the claim that they made six picks is false.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim suggests the Philadelphia Flyers made six draft picks within a certain range.
