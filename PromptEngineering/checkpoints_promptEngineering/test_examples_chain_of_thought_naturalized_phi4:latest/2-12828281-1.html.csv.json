    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, let's analyze it step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The statement claims that \"the game played on December 6, 1964, was after week 13.\" This implies we need to verify whether the game in Row 13 (since its date is December 6, 1964) occurred in a week later than Week 13.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Table**:\n   - According to the table, each row represents a game played during a specific week.\n   - Specifically, Row 13 lists: `week: 13`, `date: december 6 , 1964`.\n\n3. **Interpreting the Data**:\n   - The date December 6, 1964, is listed under Week 13 in Row 13.\n   - This means that this game was part of Week 13, not after it.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the game played on December 6, 1964, is associated with Week 13 and not a subsequent week (like Week 14 or later), the claim \"the game played on December 6, 1964, was after Week 13\" is false.\n\n5. **Identifying Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant information for this analysis comes from Row 13: `week` and `date`.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim states that the game on December 6, 1964 was after Week 13.\",\n    \"From the table, we see that Row 13 corresponds to Week 13 with a date of December 6, 1964.\",\n    \"Since the game is listed under Week 13 and not beyond it, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
