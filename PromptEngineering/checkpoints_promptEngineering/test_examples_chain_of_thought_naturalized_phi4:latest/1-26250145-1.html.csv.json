    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"terrified be one of the song she sing in the week with a bollywood theme\" is true or false, we will analyze the provided table data step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Song Choice:**\n   - The claim mentions the song \"terrified.\"\n\n2. **Locate the Song in the Table:**\n   - We need to find a row where the song choice is \"terrified.\" \n   - From Row 2, we see that the song choice is indeed \"terrified.\"\n\n3. **Check the Theme for the Week:**\n   - For Row 2, the theme is listed as \"first solo.\"\n   - The claim specifies a \"bollywood\" theme.\n\n4. **Verify Consistency with the Claim:**\n   - Since the theme for \"terrified\" in Row 2 is \"first solo,\" it does not match the \"bollywood\" theme mentioned in the claim.\n   \n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - There is no row in the table where the song choice is \"terrified\" and the theme is \"bollywood.\"\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 2:\n  - Column: \"theme,\" Value: \"first solo\"\n  - Column: \"song choice,\" Value: \"terrified\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The song 'terrified' appears in Row 2 with the theme 'first solo.'
