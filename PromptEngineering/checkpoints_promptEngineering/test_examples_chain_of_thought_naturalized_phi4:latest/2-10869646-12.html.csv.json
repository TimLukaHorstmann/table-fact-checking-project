    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to evaluate the crowd sizes for each venue listed in the table and identify if Princes Park recorded the highest attendance.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column:** The claim concerns \"highest crowd participation,\" which refers to the number of people attending a game at a specific venue. Therefore, we need to look at the \"crowd\" column in each row of the table.\n\n2. **Extract crowd data for Princes Park:**\n   - Row 2 lists Hawthorn as the home team with Richmond as the away team.\n   - The venue is Princes Park.\n   - The crowd size for this match is 15,710.\n\n3. **Compare Princes Park's crowd to other venues:**\n   - **Arden Street Oval (Row 1):** Crowd size is 9,016.\n   - **Junction Oval (Row 3):** Crowd size is 12,519.\n   - **Windy Hill (Row 4):** Crowd size is 25,867.\n   - **MCG (Melbourne Cricket Ground) (Row 5):** Crowd size is 23,336.\n   - **VFL Park (Row 6):** Crowd size is 16,320.\n\n4. **Determine the highest crowd:**\n   - The largest crowd recorded in this table is at Windy Hill with a size of 25,867.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Princes Park's crowd size of 15,710 is not the highest among the venues listed.
