We'll examine these parts step-by-step using the table provided:\n\n### Step 1: Verify Seve Ballesteros' Placement\n- Look at Row 6, where it lists \"player: seve ballesteros.\"\n- In the \"place\" column for this row, it shows \"t6,\" indicating a tie for 6th place.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Seve Ballesteros' Country of Origin\n- In the same Row 6, check the \"country\" column.\n- It lists \"spain\" as his country.\n\nBoth parts of the claim are consistent with the information in the table.
