No other game listed for a different time.\n\n   - **Margaret Green Park:**\n     - Only one game recorded at 14:00. No other game listed for a different time.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Humber College North had multiple games, thus it is not the ground where only one game was played.\n   - Rideau Carleton Raceway and Margaret Green Park each hosted only one game, confirming that no more than one game occurred at these grounds.\n\n5. **Interpretation of the Claim:**\n   - The claim states there were \"no games play on ground that be only play at 1 time,\" meaning it implies there should not exist any ground with exactly one game.\n   - However, Rideau Carleton Raceway and Margaret Green Park each had exactly one game.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because there are grounds where only one game was played.\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
