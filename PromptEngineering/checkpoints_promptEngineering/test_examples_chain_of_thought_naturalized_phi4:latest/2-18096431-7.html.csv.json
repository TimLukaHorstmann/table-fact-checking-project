    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to compare the earnings of Kenny Perry and Mark Brooks according to the table data.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Earnings for Each Player:**\n   - Look at Row 1 for Mark Brooks:\n     - **Column:** \"money\"\n     - **Value:** $430,000\n   - Look at Row 2 for Kenny Perry:\n     - **Column:** \"money\"\n     - **Value:** $260,000\n\n2. **Calculate the Difference in Earnings:**\n   - Calculate how much more Mark Brooks earned compared to Kenny Perry by subtracting Kenny Perry's earnings from Mark Brooks's earnings:\n     \\[\n     430,000 - 260,000 = 170,000\n     \\]\n   - This calculation shows that Mark Brooks earned $170,000 more than Kenny Perry.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"Kenny Perry earn 170,000 more than Mark Brook.\" According to our calculations, Kenny Perry actually earned $170,000 less than Mark Brooks.\n   - Therefore, the claim is incorrect as it reverses the actual earnings difference.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Kenny Perry did not earn $170,000 more; instead, he earned $170,000 less than Mark Brooks.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Frank Nobilo be the only player from Zimbabwe\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table and follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Frank Nobilo's Country**: \n   - Locate the row where Frank Nobilo is listed as a player.\n   - Check the country associated with Frank Nobilo.\n\n2. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - Confirm if Frank Nobilo's country is New Zealand, as per the table.\n   - Look for any other players from Zimbabwe in the table to verify if there are none.\n\n3. **Check All Rows for Players from Zimbabwe**:\n   - Examine each row and note down the countries of all listed players.\n   - Specifically check for any player whose country is listed as Zimbabwe.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Frank Nobilo's Country**:\n   - In Row 12, Frank Nobilo is associated with New Zealand.\n\n2. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Frank Nobilo should be from Zimbabwe, but according to the table, he is from New Zealand.\n   - Therefore, the premise of the claim itself is incorrect.\n\n3. **Check All Rows for Players from Zimbabwe**:\n   - In Row 13, Nick Price is listed as a player from Zimbabwe.\n\nSince there is indeed a player (Nick Price) from Zimbabwe in the table, Frank Nobilo cannot be \"the only player from Zimbabwe\" because he is not from Zimbabwe at all.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false for two reasons: Frank Nobilo is not from Zimbabwe, and there is another player (Nick Price) from Zimbabwe listed in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify Frank Nobilo's country from Row 12: New Zealand.\",\n    \"Verify if Frank Nobilo is from Zimbabwe: He is not.\",\n    \"Check all rows for players from Zimbabwe: Nick Price is a player from Zimbabwe in Row 13.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
