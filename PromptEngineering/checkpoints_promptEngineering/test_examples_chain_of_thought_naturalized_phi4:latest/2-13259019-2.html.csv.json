    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the game result at Soldier Field after week 10 being a win (W) by 31-29 is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Game at Soldier Field**: \n   - According to the table, the game at Soldier Field took place during Week 10.\n   - We need to check the details of this specific game.\n\n2. **Verify the Result of the Game**:\n   - The claim specifies that after week 10, the result was a win (W) with a score of 31-29. \n   - Thus, we need to confirm both the outcome (win or loss) and the exact score for this particular game.\n\n3. **Check Subsequent Weeks**:\n   - We must ensure there are no games at Soldier Field after week 10 that could contradict the claim.\n   - The claim mentions \"after week 10\", so only games prior to or during week 10 at Soldier Field matter for verifying the result stated in the claim.\n\n4. **Review the Table Data**:\n   - Locate row 10: This row corresponds to Week 10, with the opponent listed as Chicago Bears and the game site as Soldier Field.\n   - Check the \"result\" column in this row to confirm it matches the score specified (W 31-29).\n\n5. **Determine Validity of the Claim**:\n   - If the result for week 10 at Soldier Field is indeed W 31-29, and there are no subsequent games at Soldier Field that contradict this outcome, then the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the table data:\n\n- **Row 10 (Week 10)**: \n  - Opponent: Chicago Bears\n  - Result: W 31 - 29\n  - Game Site: Soldier Field\n\nThe result of the game at Soldier Field in Week 10 is confirmed as a win with a score of 31-29.
