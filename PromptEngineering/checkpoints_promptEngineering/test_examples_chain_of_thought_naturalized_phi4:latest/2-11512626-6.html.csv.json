The only available records are for Athletics but not specifically against the Rockies.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - We do not find any instance where the score was 4 - 5 involving the Athletics.\n   - Additionally, there is no record provided that shows the Athletics' specific game outcomes or records against the Colorado Rockies in this table.\n\nBased on these observations, the claim about the Athletics having a record of 53 - 32 against the Colorado Rockies when the score was 4 - 5 cannot be verified as true with the data given.
