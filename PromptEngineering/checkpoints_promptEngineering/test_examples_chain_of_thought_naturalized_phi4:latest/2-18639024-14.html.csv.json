    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Enza Barilla and Snez Veljanovska being inactive athletes is true or false, we need to analyze their respective years of activity from the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Rows:**\n   - Locate the rows for Enza Barilla and Snez Veljanovska in the table.\n   - Enza Barilla is listed in Row 3.\n   - Snez Veljanovska is listed in Row 36.\n\n2. **Examine the \"Years\" Column:**\n   - For each player, check the \"years\" column to see their period of activity.\n\n3. **Check Enza Barilla's Activity:**\n   - In Row 3, under the \"years\" column for Enza Barilla, it states \"2008 - present.\"\n   - This indicates that Enza Barilla is still active as her activity extends to the current time (\"present\").\n\n4. **Check Snez Veljanovska's Activity:**\n   - In Row 36, under the \"years\" column for Snez Veljanovska, it states \"2010 - present.\"\n   - This indicates that Snez Veljanovska is also still active as her activity extends to the current time (\"present\").\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Enza Barilla and Snez Veljanovska are no longer active.\n   - Based on the \"years\" data, both players are currently active.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since both players are still active, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Enza Barilla and Snez Veljanovska's activity periods are listed as '2008 - present' and '2010 - present', respectively.
