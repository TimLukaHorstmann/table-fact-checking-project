    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"mcg be the venue when the crowd be more than 29000\" is true or false, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Venue Column**: We need to locate where the information about venues is stored in the table.\n\n2. **Locate the Crowd Column**: We also need to find where the crowd numbers are recorded.\n\n3. **Find Entries with Crowd Greater than 29000**: Scan through each row to check if there's any entry where the crowd size exceeds 29,000.\n\n4. **Verify Venue for Each Entry**: For rows where the crowd is more than 29,000, check what venue corresponds to these entries.\n\n5. **Compare with Claimed Venue (MCG)**: Determine whether the venue listed in those specific rows matches \"mcg\".\n\nNow let's go through each row:\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Venue: western oval\n  - Crowd: 16648\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Venue: windy hill\n  - Crowd: 12800\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Venue: victoria park\n  - Crowd: 20700\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Venue: princes park\n  - Crowd: 14636\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Venue: lake oval\n  - Crowd: 13860\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Venue: mcg\n  - Crowd: 29947\n\nFrom the analysis above, only Row 6 has a crowd size greater than 29,000 (specifically, 29,947).
