    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the April 29 game be the highest attend at the air canada centre\" is true or false, we will analyze the attendance figures for games held at the Air Canada Centre.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Games at Air Canada Centre:**\n   - From the table, locate rows where \"location attendance\" specifies \"air canada centre.\"\n   - Row 3 and Row 4 are played at the Air Canada Centre.\n\n2. **Extract Attendance Figures for These Games:**\n   - **Row 3 (April 27):** The attendance is listed as 20138.\n   - **Row 4 (April 29):** The attendance is listed as 20112.\n\n3. **Compare Attendance Figures:**\n   - For the game on April 27, the attendance was 20138.\n   - For the game on April 29, the attendance was 20112.\n\n4. **Determine Which Game Had Higher Attendance:**\n   - Compare the numbers: 20138 (April 27) is greater than 20112 (April 29).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that the April 29 game had the highest attendance at the Air Canada Centre.\n   - Based on our comparison, this is false because the April 27 game had higher attendance.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified games at Air Canada Centre (Rows 3 and 4).
