    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, we need to analyze the points scored by each song entry in the table and compare them against the threshold of 100 points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Total Entries:**\n   - There are 19 rows (entries) representing different songs.\n\n2. **Count Songs Scoring Fewer than 100 Points:**\n   - Examine each row to check if the \"points\" value is less than 100.\n   - Row 1: 23 points (less than 100)\n   - Row 3: 8 points (less than 100)\n   - Row 4: 36 points (less than 100)\n   - Row 5: 5 points (less than 100)\n   - Row 6: 16 points (less than 100)\n   - Row 11: 22 points (less than 100)\n   - Row 12: 22 points (less than 100)\n   - Row 13: 72 points (less than 100)\n   - Row 15: 27 points (less than 100)\n\n   Total songs with fewer than 100 points = 9\n\n3. **Count Songs Scoring 100 Points or More:**\n   - Identify rows where the \"points\" value is 100 or more.\n   - Row 2: 104 points\n   - Row 7: 96 points (not 100 or more, so excluded)\n   - Row 9: 106 points\n   - Row 14: 139 points\n   - Row 16: 79 points (not 100 or more, so excluded)\n   - Row 17: 94 points (not 100 or more, so excluded)\n   - Row 18: 135 points\n   - Row 19: 156 points\n\n   Total songs with 100 points or more = 5\n\n4. **Determine if Less than Half Score Fewer Than 100 Points:**\n   - There are 19 entries in total.\n   - Half of 19 is 9.5, so less than half means fewer than 10 entries must score below 100 to satisfy the claim.\n\n5. **Evaluate Claim Against Calculations:**\n   - We found that 9 songs scored fewer than 100 points and 5 songs scored 100 or more.\n   - Since 9 is indeed less than 10, less than half of the songs (19) did score fewer than 100 points.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim \"less than half of the song score fewer than 100 point , the rest score more\" is TRUE based on our analysis.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"There are 19 entries in total.
