    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Ben Franks have 30 cap for the Hawke's Bay Hurricane\" is true or false, we need to evaluate each part of the statement against the information provided in the table.\n\n1. **Identify Ben Franks:**\n   - We locate the row containing \"Ben Franks\". According to Row 6:\n     - Player: Ben Franks\n     - Position: Prop\n     - Date of birth (age): 27 March 1984 (age29)\n     - Caps: 30\n     - Club / Province: Hawke's Bay / Hurricanes\n\n2. **Evaluate the number of caps:**\n   - The table states that Ben Franks has 30 caps, which matches the claim.\n\n3. **Check the club/province association:**\n   - According to Row 6, Ben Franks is associated with \"Hawke's Bay\" and the \"Hurricanes\".\n   - The claim mentions \"Hawke's Bay Hurricane\", which seems like a single entity name combining both the province and the team.\n   - The table separately lists \"Hawke's Bay\" (province) and \"Hurricanes\" (team), but they are indeed the same association for Ben Franks.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both parts of the claim, regarding the number of caps and the club/province association, match the information in the table.\n   - Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nHere's the structured output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify Ben Franks from the table. According to Row 6, he has 30 caps.\",\n    \"Check his club/province association: 'Hawke's Bay / Hurricanes' as listed in Row 6 matches 'Hawke's Bay Hurricane'.\",\n    \"Both parts of the claim match the information provided.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Caps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Club / Province\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
