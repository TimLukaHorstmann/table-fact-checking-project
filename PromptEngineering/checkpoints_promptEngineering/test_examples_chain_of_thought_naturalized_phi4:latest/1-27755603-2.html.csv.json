Here, he has the highest assists in this game.\n   - Row 6: High assists are shared between Rodney Stuckey and Will Bynum with 5 each.

However, in another game (Row 6), both he and Rodney Stuckey shared the highest assist count of 5 without any indication that it was exclusively his.\n- The attendance of 11747 at the Carrier Dome corresponds to Row 5.\n\nGiven this analysis, while Will Bynum did achieve the highest number of assists in a game (Row 5), there is another instance where he shares this record with another player (Row 6).
