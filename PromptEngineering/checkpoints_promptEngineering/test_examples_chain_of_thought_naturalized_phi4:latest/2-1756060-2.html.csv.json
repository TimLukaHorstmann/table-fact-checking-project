Here's how we can do it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Fastest Ascent Times:**\n   - We need to sort the rows by ascent time since a faster time means a shorter duration.\n   - The 5 fastest (shortest) ascent times will be at the top after sorting.\n\n2. **Check Each of the Top 5 Rows for the Year 2000:**\n   - After identifying the fastest 5 times, we need to check how many of these rows have the year listed as 2000.\n\n3. **Sort and Analyze:**\n\n   - Row 1: Ascent time is 41:55 (Year: 2000)\n   - Row 2: Ascent time is 43:07 (Year: 2013)\n   - Row 3: Ascent time is 43:12 (Year: 2008)\n   - Rows 4 and 5: Ascent time is 43:24 (Year: 2000 for both rows)\n   - Row 6: Ascent time is 43:35 (Year: 2013)\n   - Rows 7: Ascent time is 43:35 (Year: 2013)\n   - Row 8: Ascent time is 43:54 (Year: 2008)\n   - Row 9: Ascent time is 43:55 (Year: 2002)\n   - Row 10: Ascent time is 43:57 (Year: 2011)\n   - Row 11: Ascent time is 44:10 (Year: 2008)\n   - Row 12: Ascent time is 44:13 (Year: 2000)\n   - Row 13: Ascent time is 44:17 (Year: 2008)\n\n4. **Select the Top 5 Fastest Times:**\n   - The fastest times are in rows 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n5. **Count How Many of These Are from the Year 2000:**\n   - Row 1 (41:55) is from 2000.\n   - Row 4 (43:24) is from 2000.\n   - Row 5 (43:24) is from 2000.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Three out of these five fastest times are indeed from the year 2000.\n\nThus, the claim \"3 of the 5 fastest time come in 2000\" is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the 5 fastest ascent times by sorting rows based on ascent time.
