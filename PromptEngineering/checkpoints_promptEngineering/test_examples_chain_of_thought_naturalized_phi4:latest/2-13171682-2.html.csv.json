    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim, we need to evaluate the Chicago Blackhawks' record before and after the game on January 6.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant match:**\n   - The claim refers to a specific game on January 6 against an unspecified opponent. Let's find this in the data provided.\n   \n2. **Locate the game on January 6:**\n   - From the data, we find that Row 30 mentions a game on February 1 (not January 6). This indicates there is no entry for January 6, so we need to check adjacent entries for context.\n\n3. **Check surrounding records:**\n   - Before January 6, the last recorded game was on December 29 (Row 28), with a record of 8-10-3.\n   - The next recorded game after this period is on January 25 (Row 29) against the Toronto Maple Leafs, with a record of 15-11-3.\n\n4. **Assess games between December 29 and January 25:**\n   - Between these dates, we must consider other entries to find any missing games.\n   - The next sequential game after December 29 is on January 8 (Row 31) against the Montreal Canadiens with a record of 9-10-3.\n\n5. **Determine the change in records:**\n   - Since the Blackhawks' record changed from 8-10-3 to 9-10-3, there must have been one win without any ties or losses between December 29 and January 8.\n   - The only logical gap for this game is between December 29 and January 8.
