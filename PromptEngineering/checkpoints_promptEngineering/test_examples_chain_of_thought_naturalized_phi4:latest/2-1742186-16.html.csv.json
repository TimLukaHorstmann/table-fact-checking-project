    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"none of the teams have the word 'adelaide' in their name\" is true or false, we need to examine each team's name listed in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Review Each Team Name:**\n   - Row 1: \"the cove sc\"\n     - Check if it contains \"adelaide\": It does not.\n   - Row 2: \"gawler\"\n     - Check if it contains \"adelaide\": It does not.\n   - Row 3: \"nab\"\n     - Check if it contains \"adelaide\": It does not.\n   - Row 4: \"northern demons\"\n     - Check if it contains \"adelaide\": It does not.\n   - Row 5: \"salisbury united\"\n     - Check if it contains \"adelaide\": It does not.\n   - Row 6: \"seaford\"\n     - Check if it contains \"adelaide\": It does not.\n   - Row 7: \"south adelaide\"\n     - Check if it contains \"adelaide\": It does contain the word \"adelaide.\"\n   - Row 8: \"sturt lions fc\"\n     - Check if it contains \"adelaide\": It does not.\n   - Row 9: \"western toros\"\n     - Check if it contains \"adelaide\": It does not.\n   - Row 10: \"west adelaide\"\n     - Check if it contains \"adelaide\": It does contain the word \"adelaide.\"\n\n2. **Conclusion from Analysis:**\n   - The claim states that none of the teams have the word \"adelaide\" in their name. However, we found that two team names (\"south adelaide\" and \"west adelaide\") do include the word \"adelaide.\"\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n3. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - Row 7, column \"team\": \"south adelaide\"\n   - Row 10, column \"team\": \"west adelaide\"\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Upon reviewing each team name, two teams ('south adelaide' and 'west adelaide') contain the word 'adelaide.' Therefore, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
