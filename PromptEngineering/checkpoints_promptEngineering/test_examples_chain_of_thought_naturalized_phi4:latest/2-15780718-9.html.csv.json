    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Games**: The claim specifically mentions a game against Miami. We need to find all games where Detroit played against Miami.\n\n2. **Check Rebound Records for Those Games**:\n   - Look at the columns \"high rebounds\" in those specific rows to see who had the highest rebounds.\n   - Verify if Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy both have 14 rebounds in any of these games.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim**: The claim states that both Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy had the highest rebound count against Miami, specifically 14 rebounds each.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Games**:\n   - From the table, Detroit played against Miami on April 8 (Game 77) and April 15 (Game 81).\n\n2. **Check Rebound Records for These Games**:\n   - **April 8 (Game 77)**: \n     - High rebounds: Michael Bradley (8)\n     - Jelani McCoy is not mentioned.\n   - **April 15 (Game 81)**:\n     - High rebounds: Jerome Williams (17)\n     - Neither Michael Bradley nor Jelani McCoy are mentioned.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - In both games against Miami, neither Michael Bradley nor Jelani McCoy had the highest rebound count of 14.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells for this analysis include:\n\n- Game 77: Row 5\n  - \"high rebounds\": Michael Bradley (8)\n- Game 81: Row 9\n  - \"high rebounds\": Jerome Williams (17)\n\nHere's the final output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified games against Miami on April 8 and April 15.
