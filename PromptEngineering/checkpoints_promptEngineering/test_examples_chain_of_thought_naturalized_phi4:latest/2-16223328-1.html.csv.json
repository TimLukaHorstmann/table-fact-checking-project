Here's a step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify the Source and Date Administered**: \n   - The claim mentions \"survey usa,\" so we should locate any row(s) with this poll source.\n   \n2. **Check for the Correct Date Range**:\n   - According to the claim, the date administered should be between October 30 and November 2, 2008.\n\n3. **Locate Relevant Row**:\n   - We look through each row in the table to find one where the poll source is \"survey usa.\"\n   \n4. **Verify Date Range**:\n   - Once we identify the relevant row(s), check if the date administered matches or falls within October 30 to November 2, 2008.\n\nLet's go through the rows:\n\n- **Row 1**: Poll Source: reuters / zogby\n  - Not relevant as it doesn't mention \"survey usa.\"\n\n- **Row 2**: Poll Source: rasmussen reports / fox news\n  - Not relevant as it doesn't mention \"survey usa.\"\n\n- **Row 3**: Poll Source: public policy polling\n  - Not relevant as it doesn't mention \"survey usa.\"\n\n- **Row 4**: Poll Source: reuters / zogby\n  - Not relevant as it doesn't mention \"survey usa.\"\n\n- **Row 5**: Poll Source: survey usa\n  - Date Administered: October 30 - November 2, 2008\n  - This matches the poll source and falls within the date range specified in the claim.\n\nBased on this analysis, Row 5 confirms that a poll by \"survey usa\" was administered between October 30 and November 2, 2008.
