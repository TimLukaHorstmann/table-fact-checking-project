    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Alberto Pag\u00e1n's wins being all in the 500cc class, with an average point of 87, is TRUE or FALSE, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Alberto Pag\u00e1n\u2019s Wins**:\n   - We first look for entries where `wins` is greater than 0, as this indicates a win.\n   \n2. **Verify the Class for Each Win**:\n   - For each winning entry, check if the class is `500cc`.\n\n3. **Calculate Average Points for Winning Entries in 500cc**:\n   - Extract the `points` values from the entries where `class` is `500cc` and there was a win.\n   - Calculate the average of these points.\n\n4. **Check Consistency with the Claim**:\n   - Verify if all wins are indeed in the `500cc` class.\n   - Check if the calculated average points for these wins is 87.\n\nLet's go through the relevant rows:\n\n- **Row 21**: year: 1969, class: 500cc, team: linto, points: 15, wins: 1\n- **Row 26**: year: 1971, class: 500cc, team: linto, points: 29, wins: 1\n- **Row 27**: year: 1971, class: 500cc, team: mv agusta, points: 29, wins: 1\n- **Row 29**: year: 1972, class: 500cc, team: mv agusta, points: 87, wins: 1\n\nAll these rows indicate that the `class` is `500cc` and there are wins. The points for these wins are 15, 29, 29, and 87.\n\n**Calculate Average Points**:\n- Sum of points = 15 + 29 + 29 + 87 = 160\n- Number of winning entries = 4\n- Average points = 160 / 4 = 40\n\nThe average point for the wins is 40, not 87. Therefore, the claim that the average point is 87 is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll of Alberto Pag\u00e1n's wins are indeed in the `500cc` class, but the average point is not 87; it is 40.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify all entries where wins > 0.\",\n    \"Check if each win entry has class '500cc'.\",\n    \"Extract points for these 500cc wins: 15, 29, 29, and 87.\",\n    \"Calculate the average of these points: (15 + 29 + 29 + 87) / 4 = 40.\",\n    \"Verify if the claim's average point of 87 matches the calculated average of 40.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
