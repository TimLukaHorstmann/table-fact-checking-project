    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"78 - 84 be not the highest record in September\" is true or false, we need to evaluate the records listed for each game played in September according to the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that a record of 78 wins and 84 losses is not the highest record achieved by the team in September. Therefore, there must be another record higher than this one for the statement to be true.\n\n2. **Identify the Relevant Column**: The relevant column for this task is \"record,\" which tracks the team's win-loss record after each game.\n\n3. **Extract Records from Each Row**:\n   - We need to check each row for its recorded win-loss count at the end of that game.\n   - Extract the records sequentially from each row in September.\n\n4. **Find the Highest Record**:\n   - As we go through the rows, keep track of the highest number of wins and compare it with 78 wins to determine if a higher record was achieved.\n\n5. **Analyze Each Row**:\n   - Row 1: Record = 60 - 76\n   - Row 2: Record = 60 - 77\n   - Row 3: Record = 60 - 78\n   - Row 4: Record = 61 - 78\n   - Row 5: Record = 62 - 78\n   - Row 6: Record = 62 - 79\n   - Row 7: Record = 62 - 80\n   - Row 8: Record = 63 - 80\n   - Row 9: Record = 64 - 80\n   - Row 10: Record = 65 - 80\n   - Row 11: Record = 66 - 80\n   - Row 12: Record = 67 - 80\n   - Row 13: Record = 68 - 80\n   - Row 14: Record = 68 - 81\n   - Row 15: Record = 69 - 81\n   - Row 16: Record = 69 - 82\n   - Row 17: Record = 70 - 82\n   - Row 18: Record = 71 - 82\n   - Row 19: Record = 71 - 83\n   - Row 20: Record = 71 - 84\n   - Row 21: Record = 72 - 84\n   - Row 22: Record = 73 - 84\n   - Row 23: Record = 74 - 84\n   - Row 24: Record = 75 - 84\n   - Row 25: Record = 76 - 84\n   - Row 26: Record = 77 - 84\n   - **Row 27**: Record = 78 - 84\n   - Row 28: Record = 79 - 84\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The record of 78 wins and 84 losses was reached on September 29 (Row 27).\n   - A higher record, 79 wins and 84 losses, is noted in Row 28.\n   - Therefore, the claim that \"78 - 84 be not the highest record in September\" is true because there exists a record of 79 - 84 which is higher.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The highest win-loss record achieved in September was 79-84 on Row 28.
