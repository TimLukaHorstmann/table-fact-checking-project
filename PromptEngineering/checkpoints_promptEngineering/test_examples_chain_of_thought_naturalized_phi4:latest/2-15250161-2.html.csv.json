This contradicts the claim as there is a win in the 50cc class.\n   - Row 6 (1963, 125cc): 0 wins.\n   - Row 7 (1964, 50cc): 0 wins.\n   - Row 8 (1964, 125cc): 0 wins.\n   - Row 9 (1965, 50cc): 0 wins.\n   - Row 10 (1966, 50cc): 0 wins.\n   - Row 11 (1966, 125cc): 0 wins.\n   - Row 12 (1967, 50cc): 1 win. This again contradicts the claim as there is another win in the 50cc class.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - There are recorded wins in the 50cc category, specifically in rows 5 and 12, which directly contradict the claim that Mitsuo Itoh has only ever won in the 125cc category.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Mitsuo Itoh has only ever won in the 125cc class.
