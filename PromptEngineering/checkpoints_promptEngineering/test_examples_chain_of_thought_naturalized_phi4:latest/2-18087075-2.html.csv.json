We will focus on rows that fall within these dates.\n\n2. **Extract Matches in the Specified Period:**\n   - **Row 1:** Date is 12 November 2007.\n   - **Row 2:** Date is 26 May 2008 (outside the specified period).\n   - **Row 3:** Date is 12 April 2010.\n\n   Therefore, Rows 1 and 3 are relevant for this calculation. Row 2 is outside the specified time frame and will be excluded from our analysis.\n\n3. **Determine Outcomes of Relevant Matches:**\n   - **Row 1 (Outcome):** Runner-up\n   - **Row 3 (Outcome):** Runner-up\n\n4. **Count Wins and Losses in the Specified Period:**\n   - From Rows 1 and 3, Kamke did not win any matches. Both outcomes are \"runner-up.\"\n\n5. **Calculate Win Rate:**\n   - Total Matches = 2 (from Rows 1 and 3)\n   - Wins = 0\n   - Losses = 2\n\n6. **Compute the Win Percentage:**\n   - Win Rate = (Wins / Total Matches) \u00d7 100%\n   - Win Rate = (0 / 2) \u00d7 100% = 0%\n\n7. **Compare with Claimed Win Rate:**\n   - The claim states an 80% win rate.\n   - Calculated Win Rate = 0%, which is significantly different from 80%.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe calculated win rate of 0% contradicts the claimed win rate of 80%.
