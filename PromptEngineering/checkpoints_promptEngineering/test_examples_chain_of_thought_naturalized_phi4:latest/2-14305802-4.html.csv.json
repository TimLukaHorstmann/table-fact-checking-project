    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the 1977 - 78 Philadelphia Flyer win by 3 points against the Boston Bruins\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table for games involving the Boston Bruins and check if there was a game where the Philadelphia Flyers won with a score difference of 3 points.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Games:**\n   - We look for rows where the opponent is \"boston bruins\".\n   \n2. **Check Game Outcomes:**\n   - For each identified game, check if the Philadelphia Flyers were the home team (implied by the score being listed first) and won.\n\n3. **Calculate Score Difference:**\n   - For games won by the Flyers, calculate the point difference (score of Flyers minus score of Bruins).\n\n4. **Verify Claim Conditions:**\n   - Ensure that in one of these games, the Flyers won with exactly a 3-point margin.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Row 7:** \n  - Opponent: boston bruins\n  - Score: 6 - 4 (Flyers win)\n  - Point difference: 6 - 4 = 2\n\n- **Row 11:** \n  - Opponent: boston bruins\n  - Score: 1 - 6 (Bruins win)\n\nThe only game against the Boston Bruins where the Flyers won was in Row 7, with a score of 6 - 4. The point difference here is 2, not 3.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThere is no game in the table where the Philadelphia Flyers won by exactly 3 points against the Boston Bruins. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify games against the Boston Bruins.\",\n    \"Check if the Flyers won any of these games.\",\n    \"Calculate the point difference for winning games.\",\n    \"Verify if there was a win by exactly 3 points.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
