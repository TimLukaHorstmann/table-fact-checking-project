    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about sunflower oil having the second highest polyunsaturated fat content is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Polyunsaturated Fat Content for Each Oil:**\n   - We will extract the polyunsaturated fat values from each row in the table.\n   - Note that for high oleic variety sunflower oil, a different value is provided.\n\n2. **List the Polyunsaturated Fat Values:**\n   - Sunflower oil (standard): 69 g\n   - Soybean oil: 58 g\n   - Canola oil: 28 g\n   - Olive oil: 11 g\n   - Corn oil: 55 g\n   - Peanut oil: 32 g\n   - Rice bran oil: 37 g\n   - Vegetable shortening (hydrogenated): 37 g\n   - Lard: 11 g\n   - Suet: 3 g\n\n3. **Rank the Oils by Polyunsaturated Fat Content:**\n   - Sort these values in descending order to determine their ranking.\n\n4. **Determine the Rank of Sunflower Oil:**\n   - Check where sunflower oil falls in this sorted list.\n\n5. **Compare with the Claim:**\n   - Verify if sunflower oil is indeed second on this list.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**\n\n1. Extract polyunsaturated fat values:\n   - Row 1 (Sunflower oil): 69 g\n   - Row 2 (Soybean oil): 58 g\n   - Row 3 (Canola oil): 28 g\n   - Row 4 (Olive oil): 11 g\n   - Row 5 (Corn oil): 55 g\n   - Row 6 (Peanut oil): 32 g\n   - Row 7 (Rice bran oil): 37 g\n   - Row 8 (Vegetable shortening): 37 g\n   - Row 9 (Lard): 11 g\n   - Row 10 (Suet): 3 g\n\n2.
