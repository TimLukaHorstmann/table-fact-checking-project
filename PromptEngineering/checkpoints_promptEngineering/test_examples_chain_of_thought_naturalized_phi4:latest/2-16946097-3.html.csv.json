    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"the record be 2 - 4 when the h / a / n be h,\" we need to analyze the table step-by-step, focusing on the relevant columns: \"h/a/n\" (home/away/neither) and \"record.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**:\n   - We are interested in rows where \"h/a/n\" is 'h' because we want to verify the record when the games were played at home.\n\n2. **Extract Home Games**:\n   - Row 1: h\n   - Row 3: h\n   - Row 5: h\n   - Row 6: n (not relevant as it's neither)\n   - Row 7: h\n   - Row 9: h\n   - Row 10: h\n\n3. **Check Records for Home Games**:\n   - Row 1: Record is 0 - 1.\n   - Row 3: Record is 1 - 2.\n   - Row 5: Record is 1 - 4.\n   - Row 7: Record is 2 - 5.\n   - Row 9: Record is 2 - 7.\n   - Row 10: Record is 2 - 8.\n\n4. **Determine if Any Home Game Matches the Claim**:\n   - We need to find any instance where a home game (\"h/a/n\" = 'h') has a record of \"2 - 4.\"\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - None of the records for the games played at home match \"2 - 4.\" Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 1: \"h/a/n\": 'h', \"record\": \"0 - 1\"\n- Row 3: \"h/a/n\": 'h', \"record\": \"1 - 2\"\n- Row 5: \"h/a/n\": 'h', \"record\": \"1 - 4\"\n- Row 7: \"h/a/n\": 'h', \"record\": \"2 - 5\"\n- Row 9: \"h/a/n\": 'h', \"record\": \"2 - 7\"\n- Row 10: \"h/a/n\": 'h', \"record\": \"2 - 8\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We identified the rows where 'h/a/n' is 'h' and checked their records.
