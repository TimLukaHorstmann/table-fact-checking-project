    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"winamac joined 10 years after southwestern join\" is true or false, we need to analyze the joining years of both schools from the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Winamac's Join Year:**\n   - Locate the row for \"winamac.\"\n   - From Row 6, the \"year joined\" for winamac is 1947.\n\n2. **Identify Southwestern's Join Year:**\n   - Locate the row for \"southwestern.\"\n   - From Row 8, the \"year joined\" for southwestern is 1958.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Years:**\n   - Determine the difference between the joining years of winamac and southwestern.\n   - Southwestern joined in 1958, while winamac joined in 1947.\n   - Calculate the difference: \\(1958 - 1947 = 11\\).\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that winamac joined 10 years after southwestern.\n   - However, based on our calculation, winamac joined 11 years before southwestern.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since winamac joined 11 years earlier than southwestern, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 6, \"year joined\": 1947 (for winamac)\n- Row 8, \"year joined\": 1958 (for southwestern)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify Winamac's Join Year from Row 6: 1947.\",\n    \"Identify Southwestern's Join Year from Row 8: 1958.\",\n    \"Calculate the difference in joining years: 1958 - 1947 = 11.\",\n    \"The claim states winamac joined 10 years after southwestern, but it actually joined 11 years earlier.\",\n    \"Therefore, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
