The key piece of information required here is not directly available in the table since it only lists losses. However, we can infer total games played and calculate wins using the data provided.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand Table Structure:**\n   - Each row provides details about a coach's tenure including the number of seasons they coached (`seasons`), the number of losses (`lost`), and their winning percentage (`pct`). \n   - The last column, `pct`, indicates the percentage of games won.\n\n2. **Identify Frank Johnson\u2019s Data:**\n   - Locate Row 17 for Frank Johnson:\n     - Seasons: 14.5\n     - Lost: 175\n     - Pct: 499\n\n3. **Calculate Total Games Played by Frank Johnson:**\n   - The winning percentage (pct) is given as a whole number representing the percentage of games won.\n   - `Pct = Wins / Total Games * 100`\n   - Thus, to find total games played: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Games} = \\frac{\\text{Wins}}{\\text{Pct}} \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - Rearranging the formula for wins:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Wins} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Pct}}{100}\\right) \\times \\text{Total Games}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Wins and Total Games:**\n   - From the pct (499), Frank Johnson won 499 games out of every 1000.\n   - Let \\( G \\) be the total number of games played by Frank Johnson.\n   - According to the pct formula:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{499}{100} \\times G = (\\text{Total Games}) - 175\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( G \\):\n     \\[\n     G = \\frac{175}{1 - \\left(\\frac{499}{1000}\\right)}\n     \\]\n   - Calculate:\n     \\[\n     G = \\frac{175}{\\frac{501}{1000}} = \\frac{175 \\times 1000}{501} \\approx 349.3\n     \\]\n   - Since the total number of games must be a whole number, round to 350.\n   - Calculate Wins:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Wins} = \\left(\\frac{499}{100}\\right) \\times 350 \\approx 174.65 \\approx 175\n     \\]\n\n5. **Compare with Other Coaches:**\n   - Review other coaches' data to check if any had more wins.\n   - Since the winning percentage and losses are given, use similar calculations for other coaches.\n   - The coach with a higher number of seasons or pct who also has fewer losses could potentially have more wins.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Frank Johnson's calculated wins (approximately 175) do not appear to exceed any other coach when compared similarly.\n   - No other coach in the list has a higher win percentage and lower loss count that would result in more wins than Frank Johnson during his tenure.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis of the data provided, the claim is false.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze the information provided in the table regarding the coaching status of Frank Martin and Darrin Horn.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - The claim involves two coaches: Frank Martin and Darrin Horn.\n   - Look for rows corresponding to each coach:\n     - Row 32 corresponds to Darrin Horn with \"years\": \"2008 - 2012\".\n     - Row 33 corresponds to Frank Martin with \"years\": \"2012 - present\".\n\n2. **Analyze Coaching Periods:**\n   - **Darrin Horn (Row 32):** \n     - His coaching period is from 2008 to 2012.\n     - This indicates he was no longer coaching after 2012.\n\n   - **Frank Martin (Row 33):**\n     - His coaching period starts in 2012 and continues \"to present\".\n     - This implies that Frank Martin is still coaching as of the latest data in the table.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states: \"frank martin be not longer coaching , but darrin horn be.\"\n   - Based on the analysis:\n     - Frank Martin is still coaching (\"2012 - present\").\n     - Darrin Horn is no longer coaching (his period ended in 2012).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is incorrect because it reverses the current coaching statuses of Frank Martin and Darrin Horn.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table indicates that Darrin Horn coached from 2008 to 2012, so he is no longer coaching. Frank Martin has been coaching since 2012 and continues to do so ('to present'). Therefore, the claim 'frank martin be not longer coaching , but darrin horn be' is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"years\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
