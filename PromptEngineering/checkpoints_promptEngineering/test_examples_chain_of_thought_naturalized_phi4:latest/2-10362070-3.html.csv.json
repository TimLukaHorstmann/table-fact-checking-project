    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify two main points:\n\n1. **Frequency of Green Bay Packers as Opponent:**\n   - The claim states that the Green Bay Packers were opponents on two occasions.\n\n2. **Specific Dates for Matches Against the Green Bay Packers:**\n   - According to the claim, these matches occurred on September 4, 1988, and December 11, 1988.\n\nLet's examine the table row by row focusing on these aspects:\n\n- **Row 7**:\n  - Date: October 16, 1988\n  - Opponent: Green Bay Packers\n  - This shows that the first game against the Packers was in Week 7 on October 16, 1988.\n\n- **Row 15**:\n  - Date: December 11, 1988\n  - Opponent: Green Bay Packers\n  - This indicates the second game against the Packers occurred in Week 15 on December 11, 1988.\n\nNow, let's compare these findings with the claim:\n\n1. The claim states that the Packers were opponents twice, which matches our finding of two games (Weeks 7 and 15).\n2. However, one of the dates mentioned in the claim is September 4, 1988. \n   - Checking **Row 1**:\n     - Date: September 4, 1988\n     - Opponent: Buffalo Bills\n   - The opponent on September 4, 1988, was not the Green Bay Packers but the Buffalo Bills.\n\nThus, the claim is incorrect because while the Packers were indeed opponents twice, one of the specified dates (September 4, 1988) does not match any game against them. \n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim is FALSE as it inaccurately states that one of the matches against the Green Bay Packers occurred on September 4, 1988.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Verify how many times the Green Bay Packers were opponents.\",\n    \"Identify the dates for games against the Green Bay Packers.\",\n    \"Row 7 shows a game against the Packers on October 16, 1988.\",\n    \"Row 15 shows another game against the Packers on December 11, 1988.\",\n    \"The claim incorrectly states that one of these games was on September 4, 1988.\",\n    \"On September 4, 1988 (Row 1), the opponent was Buffalo Bills, not Green Bay Packers.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
