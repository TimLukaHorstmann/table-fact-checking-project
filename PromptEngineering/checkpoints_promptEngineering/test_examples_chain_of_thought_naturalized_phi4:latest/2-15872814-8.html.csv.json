    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the score on April 8 being \"w 109 - 101 (ot)\" is true, we need to examine the table for game data corresponding to that date.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:** \n   - We are looking for a row where the `date` column matches \"april 8\".\n\n2. **Examine the Date Column:**\n   - From the table, we see:\n     - Row 4 has `date: april 6`.\n     - Row 5 has `date: april 9`.\n     - Therefore, Row 4 is between April 6 and April 9.\n     - Row 4 ends with a record of \"30 - 44\", and Row 5 starts with a record of \"31 - 45\".\n     - Hence, Row 4 must correspond to the game on April 8.\n\n3. **Check Game Details in Row 4:**\n   - `game:` matches as part of sequence after Row 3 (`game: 74`) and before Row 5 (`game: 76`), confirming it's `game: 75`.\n   - Verify the `score` column for this row: it states \"w 109 - 101 (ot)\".\n   - Confirm other details such as `team:` being \"atlanta\" and `record:` changing from \"30 - 44\" to \"31 - 44\", indicating a win.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** \n   - The score on April 8 is indeed \"w 109 - 101 (ot)\" according to the table's data in Row 4.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The date 'april 8' corresponds to Row 4.
