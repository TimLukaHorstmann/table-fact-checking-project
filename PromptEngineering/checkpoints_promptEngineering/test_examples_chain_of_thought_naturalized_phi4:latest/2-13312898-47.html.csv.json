    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Edgerrin James is true, we need to verify two specific points from the table:\n\n1. Whether Edgerrin James was indeed the number 4 pick in the first round.\n2. Whether he was the number 4 overall pick.\n\nLet's analyze these step-by-step using the provided table:\n\n- **Step 1:** Identify the row corresponding to Edgerrin James.\n  - From Row 1, we see that \"name: edgerrin james\" is listed with details about his draft position.\n\n- **Step 2:** Check the round number and pick within that round for Edgerrin James.\n  - The table shows that Edgerrin James was picked in \"round: 1\" and it was \"pick: 4\".\n\n- **Step 3:** Verify if this is consistent with being the overall fourth pick.\n  - In Row 1, it also states \"overall: 4\", confirming he was indeed the fourth overall pick.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are satisfied (he was the number 4 pick in the first round and also the number 4 overall), we conclude that the claim is true.\n\nRelevant cells from the table:\n- Row 1, Column \"round\": round: 1\n- Row 1, Column \"pick\": pick: 4\n- Row 1, Column \"overall\": overall: 4\n\nHere's the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Edgerrin James is listed as being picked in round 1 at pick number 4. The table also states that his overall pick was number 4, confirming both parts of the claim.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
