    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Tony Lorick be the running back for Oakland\" is true or false, we need to verify two key components from the table: \n\n1. Whether Tony Lorick is associated with the team \"Oakland.\"\n2. Whether Tony Lorick's position is \"running back (rb).\"\n\nLet's go through the reasoning process step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Tony Lorick in the Table**: \n   - We need to find a row where the player name matches \"Tony Lorick.\"\n\n2. **Check Team Association**:\n   - Once we locate Tony Lorick, verify if he is associated with the team \"Oakland\" by checking the 'team' column.\n\n3. **Verify Position**:\n   - Confirm that his position is listed as \"rb\" (running back) in the 'position' column.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the table:\n\n- **Row 7** contains the player name \"Tony Lorick.\"\n  - Check the 'team' column for Row 7: It lists \"Oakland,\" confirming that Tony Lorick is indeed associated with Oakland.\n  - Check the 'position' column for Row 7: It lists \"rb\" (running back), confirming his position as a running back.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied based on the information in Row 7. Therefore, the claim \"Tony Lorick be the running back for Oakland\" is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells from the table:\n- Row 7, column 'player': \"tony lorick\"\n- Row 7, column 'team': \"oakland\"\n- Row 7, column 'position': \"rb\"\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified Tony Lorick in Row 7.

The college attended by each player.\n2. The team associated with each pick.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning process:**\n\n- **Identify the relevant column and row:** We must find which rows contain \"Ohio State\" as the value in the \"college\" column since this will indicate players from Ohio State.\n\n- **Locate the college information:** \n  - Row 3 mentions a player, Matt Snell, who is associated with the college \"ohio state.\"\n\n- **Verify the team of the identified player:**\n  - From Row 3, we see that the \"team\" for pick number 3 is \"new york.\"\n\n- **Cross-reference to confirm accuracy:** \n  - Since Row 3 indicates both the college as \"ohio state\" and the team as \"new york,\" it confirms that Matt Snell, from Ohio State, plays for New York.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim is true.
