They were Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs.\n\n2. **Part 2: Opponent in Rome in 2003**\n   - The claim states that \"in rome in 2003, the opponent be lisa raymond rennae stubbs.\"\n   - According to Row 1:\n     - Year: 2003\n     - Championship: Rome\n     - Opponents: Jelena Doki\u0107 Nadia Petrova\n   - Therefore, the opponents in Rome in 2003 were not Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs.
