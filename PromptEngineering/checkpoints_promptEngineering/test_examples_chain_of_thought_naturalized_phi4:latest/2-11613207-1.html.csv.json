    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the prize money for the \"KyJ Tour Championship\" being the only competition on the Korean tour where the prize money is offered in American dollars, we need to examine each tournament's prize fund currency from the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Prize Fund Currency**:\n   - Review each row of the table to see which tournaments have their prize funds listed in a specific currency.\n   - Most tournaments list their prize funds in Korean Won (KRW).\n\n2. **Locate the \"KyJ Tour Championship\" Row**:\n   - Find the tournament named \"hearld kyj tour championship\" in the table, which is Row 14.\n\n3. **Check the Currency for Each Tournament**:\n   - **Row 1 to Row 13**: All these rows list their prize funds as Korean Won (KRW).\n   - **Row 12 and Row 13 (CJ Invitational & Kolon Korea Open)**: These tournaments have a specific mention of prize money in USD, which is \"$750,000\" and \"US $750,000\", respectively.\n\n4. **Examine the KyJ Tour Championship**:\n   - In Row 14, the \"hearld kyj tour championship,\" the prize fund is listed as \"300000000\" without a currency specified, but it's implied to be in KRW based on the surrounding rows.\n   \n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The CJ Invitational and Kolon Korea Open are also tournaments with their prize funds listed in USD, not just the KyJ Tour Championship.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim that \"the KyJ Tour Championship be the only competition on the Korean tour where the prize money be offer in American dollar\" is FALSE because there are other tournaments (CJ Invitational and Kolon Korea Open) with prize funds listed in USD as well.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Review each tournament's prize fund currency.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate two parts: \n\n1. **Popularity of Golf Tournaments by Month**: Check how many tournaments are held in September and December.\n2. **OWGR Points for Tournaments in These Months**: Verify if the average OWGR points for these tournaments is 6.\n\nLet's break it down step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Tournaments by Month\n\n- **September Tournaments**:\n  - Row 9: Sep 12 - 15\n  - Row 10: Sep 26 - 29\n\n- **December Tournaments**: \n  - There are no tournaments listed in December.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Average OWGR Points for September\n\n- **OWGR Points for September**:\n  - Row 9: 6 points (Sep 12 - 15)\n  - Row 10: 6 points (Sep 26 - 29)\n\n- **Average OWGR Points for September**: \n  \\[\n  \\text{Average} = \\frac{6 + 6}{2} = 6\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Claim\n\n- The claim states that \"September and December be the most popular month to host golf tournament in Korea.\"\n  - Only September has tournaments, so it cannot be compared with December.\n  - September hosts 2 tournaments, which is not necessarily the highest count based on the table alone.\n\n- The claim also states that these tournaments \"be only worth 6 OWGR point\" on average.\n  - For September, the average OWGR points are indeed 6.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **Popularity**: December has no tournaments, so it cannot be considered popular. September is not necessarily the most popular month based solely on this data.\n- **OWGR Points**: The average for September is correctly stated as 6.\n\nThe claim is partially correct regarding OWGR points but incorrect about the popularity of December and the assertion that September is the most popular month without additional context.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"September has 2 tournaments with an average OWGR of 6.
