    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"5.3 be the average that have more than 0 touchdown and more than 135 yard\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to evaluate each row of the table based on the criteria given: players with more than 0 touchdowns (td 's > 0) and more than 135 yards.\n\nLet's go through the rows step-by-step:\n\n1. **Row 1**: \n   - Player: Rob Turner\n   - Yards: 171 (more than 135)\n   - Td's: 4 (more than 0)\n   - Average: 10.6\n\n2. **Row 2**:\n   - Player: Lenzie Jackson\n   - Yards: 171 (more than 135)\n   - Td's: 0 (not more than 0)\n   - This row does not meet the criteria.\n\n3. **Row 3**:\n   - Player: Kevin Ingram\n   - Yards: 135 (not more than 135)\n   - Td's: 1 (more than 0)\n   - This row does not meet the criteria.\n\n4. **Row 4**:\n   - Player: Robert Quiroga\n   - Yards: 16 (not more than 135)\n   - Td's: 2 (more than 0)\n   - This row does not meet the criteria.\n\n5. **Row 5**:\n   - Player: Terrence Stubbs\n   - Yards: 12 (not more than 135)\n   - Td's: 0 (not more than 0)\n   - This row does not meet the criteria.\n\n6. **Row 6**:\n   - Player: Josh Jeffries\n   - Yards: 58 (not more than 135)\n   - Td's: 3 (more than 0)\n   - This row does not meet the criteria.\n\nFrom this analysis, only Row 1 meets both conditions of having more than 0 touchdowns and more than 135 yards. The average for Rob Turner is 10.6, not 5.3.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"5.3 be the average that have more than 0 touchdown and more than 135 yard\" is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
