    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Viswanathan Anand is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine each part of the claim against the data provided in the table.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"Viswanathan Anand have a rating greater than 2753, with a prev less than 4, and +4 as the chng.\"\n\nWe will break down this claim into three parts and verify each one using the information from the table:\n\n1. **Rating Greater Than 2753**:\n   - According to Row 1, Viswanathan Anand's rating is 2803.\n   - We need to check if 2803 > 2753.\n   - Since 2803 is indeed greater than 2753, this part of the claim is TRUE.\n\n2. **Previous Rank (prev) Less Than 4**:\n   - From Row 1, Viswanathan Anand's previous rank (prev) is 2.\n   - We need to verify if 2 < 4.\n   - Since 2 is less than 4, this part of the claim is TRUE.\n\n3. **Change (+4 as the chng)**:\n   - From Row 1, Viswanathan Anand's change in rating (chng) is +4.\n   - We need to confirm if the change is exactly +4.\n   - Since the change is indeed +4, this part of the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll parts of the claim are verified as TRUE based on the data from Row 1 of the table. Therefore, the entire claim about Viswanathan Anand is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Check if Anand's rating (2803) is greater than 2753: TRUE.\\n2.
