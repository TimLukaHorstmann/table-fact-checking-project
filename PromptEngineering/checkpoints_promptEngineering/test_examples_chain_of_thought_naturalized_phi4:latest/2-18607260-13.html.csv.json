    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the scores on June 18 and June 28 being both 2 - 0 is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: The claim refers to specific dates: June 18 and June 28, 1998. We will look for entries in the table that match these dates.\n\n2. **Examine Scores on These Dates**:\n   - For June 18, 1998: Check if there is an entry with this date and note its score.\n   - For June 28, 1998: Similarly, check if there is an entry with this date and note its score.\n\n3. **Compare the Claimed Scores**: The claim states that both games on these dates had scores of 2 - 0. We will verify if the scores from our findings match this statement.\n\n4. **Draw a Conclusion**: Based on the comparison, determine whether the claim is true or false.\n\nLet's go through each step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**:\n   - From the table, locate any row with the date \"1998 - 06 - 18\" and another with \"1998 - 06 - 28\".\n\n2. **Examine Scores on These Dates**:\n   - **June 18, 1998**: \n     - Check each row for this date.\n     - There is no entry in the table for June 18, 1998. Therefore, there is no score to compare.\n\n   - **June 28, 1998**:\n     - Row 14 has the date \"1998 - 06 - 28\".\n     - The score listed is \"0 - 0 (1 - 0 aet)\" for this match.\n\n3. **Compare the Claimed Scores**:\n   - For June 18: There is no entry, so there is no score of 2 - 0.\n   - For June 28: The actual score was \"0 - 0 (1 - 0 aet)\", not 2 - 0.\n\n4. **Draw a Conclusion**:\n   - Since neither date has a match with the claimed score of 2 - 0, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table does not have an entry for June 18, 1998, so there is no score to verify.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"neither team scored for only the first game of the world cup in france\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant parts of the table that pertain to the World Cup matches in France.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Matches:**\n   - We are interested in the World Cup matches played in France.\n   - The column \"comp\" indicates the competition type, and rows with \"world cup\" are relevant for this claim.\n\n2. **Find World Cup Matches in France:**\n   - Check each row to see if the \"comp\" is \"world cup\".\n   - Rows 11 through 14 list matches categorized as part of the \"world cup\".\n\n3. **Determine the Venue and Date:**\n   - For these rows, verify that the venue is indeed in France.\n   - All venues listed (stade de la mosson montpellier, stade geoffroy-guichard saint-\u00e9tienne, stade de toulouse toulouse, stade f\u00e9lix bollaert lens) are located in France.\n\n4. **Check Scores for Each Match:**\n   - Row 11: Date: 1998-06-12, Score: 0 - 0\n   - Row 12: Date: 1998-06-19, Score: 0 - 0\n   - Row 13: Date: 1998-06-24, Score: 1 - 3\n   - Row 14: Date: 1998-06-28, Score: 0 - 0 (1 - 0 aet)\n\n5. **Identify the First Match:**\n   - The first World Cup match in France is on June 12, 1998, as listed in row 11.\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"neither team scored\" for only the first game.\n   - From Row 11, we see the score was indeed 0 - 0, meaning neither team scored.\n\n7. **Check Subsequent Matches:**\n   - Verify that no other World Cup match in France ended with a score of 0 - 0:\n     - Rows 12 and 14 also have scores of 0 - 0.\n     - Row 13 has a score of 1 - 3, where teams did score.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is true because only the first match (Row 11) ended with neither team scoring, while another match (Row 12) also ended 0 - 0 but occurred later.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify all World Cup matches in France.
