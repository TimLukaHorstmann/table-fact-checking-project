We need to find where \"dating in the dark\" appears at 10:00 and check what is scheduled at 9:30 on those rows.\n\n2. **Row Analysis**:\n   - **Row 3**: At 10:00, we have \"castle\". Therefore, this row does not concern us since \"dating in the dark\" is not here.\n   - **Row 4 to Row 7**: None of these rows list \"dating in the dark\" at 10:00. These rows can be ignored for our claim as they do not satisfy the condition of having \"dating in the dark\" at 10:00.\n   - **Row 8 and Row 9**: Both have \"dateline nbc\" at 10:00, so these are also irrelevant for checking \"dating in the dark\".\n\n3. **Finding 'Dating in the Dark'**:\n   - In **Row 2**, \"dating in the dark\" is scheduled at 10:00.\n   - We now check what show is listed at 9:30 on Row 2.\n\n4. **Check Show at 9:30 on Row 2**:\n   - On Row 2, under the column for 9:30, we find \"the bachelorette\".\n\n5. **Conclusion**: In Row 2 where \"dating in the dark\" appears at 10:00, it is preceded by \"the bachelorette\" at 9:30.
