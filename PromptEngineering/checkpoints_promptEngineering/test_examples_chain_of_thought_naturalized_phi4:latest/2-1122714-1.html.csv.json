    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"james hunt ran on grid 2 for 73 lap\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to evaluate the relevant information from the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify James Hunt's Row:**\n   - We start by locating the row where \"driver\" is \"james hunt\".\n   - According to Row 1 in the table:\n     - Driver: james hunt\n     - Constructor: mclaren - ford\n     - Laps: 73\n     - Time / Retired: 1:31:51.68\n     - Grid: 2\n\n2. **Check the Number of Laps:**\n   - From Row 1, we see that \"laps\" for James Hunt is listed as 73.\n\n3. **Check the Starting Grid Position:**\n   - Also from Row 1, \"grid\" for James Hunt is given as 2.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim Against the Table Data:**\n   - The claim states that James Hunt ran on grid position 2 and completed 73 laps.\n   - Both these details match perfectly with the data in Row 1 of the table:\n     - Grid Position: 2\n     - Laps Completed: 73\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe information from Row 1 confirms that James Hunt started on grid 2 and completed 73 laps.
