    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Stanford have a linebacker from Norco High School\" is TRUE or FALSE, let's analyze the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Stanford Players:** \n   - The table lists players along with their college affiliations.\n   - We need to locate any player whose college is listed as \"stanford.\"\n\n2. **Locate Players from Norco High School:**\n   - Next, we identify which players attended \"norco high school.\"\n\n3. **Check for Overlap:** \n   - Finally, check if there's an overlap between the players from Stanford and those from Norco High School.\n\nNow let's go through each step using the table:\n\n1. **Identify Stanford Players:**\n   - In Row 8, we find \"player: noor davis\" with college listed as \"stanford.\"\n\n2. **Locate Players from Norco High School:**\n   - In Row 7, \"player: scott starr\" attended \"norco high school.\"\n\n3. **Check for Overlap:** \n   - Noor Davis is the Stanford player.\n   - Scott Starr is the Norco High School player.\n   - These two players are different individuals.\n\nSince there is no overlap between a Stanford player and a player from Norco High School, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells for this analysis:\n- Row 8: Column \"college\" (Stanford)\n- Row 7: Columns \"school\" (Norco High School) and \"college\" (Southern California)\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify Stanford players.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Stanford have a linebacker from Lessburg High School\" is true or false, we need to examine the table for relevant information.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the position**: The claim mentions a \"linebacker.\" We should locate all entries in the table that are labeled as linebackers.\n   \n2. **Locate players with the position 'Linebacker'**:\n   - Row 6: player: Vince Biegel, position: linebacker\n   - Row 7: player: Scott Starr, position: linebacker\n   - Row 8: player: Noor Davis, position: linebacker\n\n3. **Check for Lessburg High School**: The claim specifies that the player attended \"Lessburg High School.\" We need to check the 'school' column of the identified linebackers.\n\n4. **Verify if any linebacker is from Lessburg High School**:\n   - Row 6: Vince Biegel attended Lincoln High School.\n   - Row 7: Scott Starr attended Norco High School.\n   - Row 8: Noor Davis attended Lessburg High School.\n\n5. **Determine the college of Noor Davis**: The claim involves Stanford University. We need to check if the player from Lessburg High School (Noor Davis) attended Stanford.\n   - Row 8: Noor Davis's college is Stanford.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Noor Davis, who attended Lessburg High School and plays as a linebacker, is listed under Stanford in the table.
