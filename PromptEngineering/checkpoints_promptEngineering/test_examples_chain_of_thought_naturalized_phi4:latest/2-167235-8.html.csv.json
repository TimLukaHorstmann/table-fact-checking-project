    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"only 1 person have be a member of the socialist party of albania\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to identify all individuals from the table who were members of the Socialist Party of Albania.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:** \n   - We are interested in the \"political party\" column since it indicates which political party each prime minister was affiliated with during their term.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row for Membership:**\n   - **Row 3 (Ylli Bufi):** Political Party is \"socialist party of albania.\"\n   - **Row 6 (Bashkim Fino):** Political Party is \"socialist party of albania.\"\n   - **Row 7 (Fatos Nano, 2nd time):** Political Party is \"socialist party of albania.\"\n   - **Row 8 (Pandeli Majko, 1st time):** Political Party is \"socialist party of albania.\"\n   - **Row 9 (Ilir Meta):** Political Party is \"socialist party of albania.\"\n   - **Row 10 (Pandeli Majko, 2nd time):** Political Party is \"socialist party of albania.\"\n   - **Row 11 (Fatos Nano, 3rd time):** Political Party is \"socialist party of albania.\"\n   - **Row 13 (Edi Rama):** Political Party is \"socialist party of albania.\"\n\n3. **Count the Number of Members:**\n   - From the above examination, we see that there are multiple individuals who have been members of the Socialist Party of Albania: Ylli Bufi, Bashkim Fino, Fatos Nano (2nd and 3rd time), Pandeli Majko (1st and 2nd time), Ilir Meta, and Edi Rama.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that only one person has been a member of the Socialist Party of Albania, but our examination shows multiple individuals have held this affiliation.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since more than one individual has been a member of the Socialist Party of Albania, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We identified all prime ministers from the table who were members of the socialist party of albania by examining the 'political party' column.
