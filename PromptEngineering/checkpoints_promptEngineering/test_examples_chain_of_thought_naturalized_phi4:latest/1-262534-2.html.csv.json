    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the most recently founded institution be a private one\" is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Year of Foundation for Each Institution:**\n   - Extract the year each institution was founded from the table.\n\n2. **Find the Most Recently Founded Institution:**\n   - Compare all the foundation years and identify which institution has the latest (most recent) founding year.\n\n3. **Check if the Most Recently Founded Institution is Private:**\n   - Verify whether this most recently founded institution is listed as a private institution in the table.\n\nLet's go through these steps with the data from the table:\n\n### Step 1: Extract Foundation Years\n- Bluefield College: 1922\n- Campbellsville University: 1906\n- Cumberland University: 1842\n- University of the Cumberlands: 1887\n- Georgetown College: 1829\n- Lindsey Wilson College: 1903\n- University of Pikeville: 1889\n- University of Rio Grande: 1876\n- Shawnee State University: 1986\n- St. Catharine College: 1873\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Most Recently Founded Institution\n- The most recent year is 1986, which corresponds to **Shawnee State University**.\n\n### Step 3: Check if This Institution is Private\n- Shawnee State University is listed as a \"public\" institution in the table.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim states that the most recently founded institution should be private.
