Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Years**: The claim specifically mentions the years 1985 and 1986.\n\n2. **Review Table Data for 1985**:\n   - Look at all entries corresponding to the year 1985.\n   - Row 11: \"year: 1985, entrant: motor racing developments ltd, chassis: brabham bt54, engine: bmw str - 4 t / c, points: 5.\"\n   - Marc Surer is known to have driven for Motor Racing Developments (MRD) in 1985. The entry matches the year and the team.\n   - Points scored by MRD in 1985 are recorded as 5.\n\n3. **Review Table Data for 1986**:\n   - Look at all entries corresponding to the year 1986.\n   - Row 12: \"year: 1986, entrant: barclay arrows bmw, chassis: arrows a8, engine: bmw str - 4 t / c, points: 0.\"\n   - Marc Surer raced for Arrows in 1986. The entry matches the year and team.\n   - Points scored by Barclay Arrows BMW in 1986 are recorded as 0.\n\n4. **Analyze the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Marc Surer scored a total of 5 points in both 1985 and 1986.\n   - From the table data, we see that he did score 5 points in 1985, but only 0 points in 1986.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the points for 1986 are not equal to 5, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's compile this reasoning into the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim concerns Marc Surer's points in 1985 and 1986.\",\n    \"In 1985, the relevant entry shows MRD with 5 points.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze Marc Surer's scoring history according to the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Marc Surer's Participation:**\n   - The table does not explicitly mention Marc Surer by name in any row. Therefore, we must deduce his involvement through additional context or historical knowledge.\n   \n2. **Historical Context of Marc Surer:**\n   - Marc Surer is a Swiss racing driver who participated in Formula 1 during the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n   - He drove for several teams including Ensign, Theodore Racing Team, Arrows, and others.\n\n3. **Match Marc Surer to Table Entries:**\n   - We need to match the years and teams he raced with the entries in the table:\n     - **1979:** Ensign (Row 1)\n     - **1980:** Theodore Racing Team (Row 5)\n     - **1982-1983:** Arrows Racing Team (Rows 6, 7, 8)\n\n4. **Calculate Marc Surer's Points:**\n   - For each year and team he raced for, sum the points:\n     - **1979 (Ensign):** 0 points\n     - **1980 (Theodore Racing Team):** 4 points\n     - **1982 (Arrows Racing Team):** 3 points\n     - **1983 (Arrows Racing Team):** 4 points\n\n   - Total Points: \\(0 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 11\\) points\n\n5. **Analyze the Claim:**\n   - The claim states, \"Marc Surer scored 6 points two times more than he scored 2 points in total.\"\n   - Calculate how many times Marc Surer scored exactly 6 points:\n     - He never scored 6 points in any single year.\n   \n   - Calculate how many times Marc Surer scored exactly 2 points:\n     - He never scored 2 points in any single year.\n\n6. **Interpret the Claim:**\n   - The claim implies a comparison between instances of scoring 6 points and 2 points.\n   - Since Marc Surer did not score 6 or 2 points in any given row, the condition cannot be satisfied.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false because Marc Surer never scored exactly 6 points nor exactly 2 points in any year according to the table. Therefore, he could not have scored 6 points two times more than he scored 2 points.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify Marc Surer's participation by matching historical context with table entries.\",\n    \"Match years and teams he raced for: Ensign (1979), Theodore Racing Team (1980), Arrows Racing Team (1982-1983).\",\n    \"Calculate total points scored by Marc Surer: 11 points.\",\n    \"Analyze the claim about scoring 6 points two times more than 2 points.\",\n    \"Determine instances of scoring exactly 6 or 2 points: none found.\",\n    \"Conclude the claim is false as the condition cannot be satisfied.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
