    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the game on October 28, 1962, having the highest attendance of any game with 60,671 attendees is true or false, we will examine the relevant parts of the table step-by-step.\n\n1. **Identify the Game Date in Question**: The claim specifically refers to a game played on October 28, 1962. We need to find this entry within the table:\n   - Row 7: Date: October 28, 1962\n\n2. **Check the Attendance for This Game**:\n   - According to Row 7, the attendance for the game on October 28, 1962, is 62,844.\n\n3. **Compare with Other Games' Attendances**: \n   - We need to verify if any other game in the table has an equal or higher attendance than 62,844.\n   \n4. **Review Attendance Values for All Games**:\n   - Row 1: Attendance = 15,730\n   - Row 2: Attendance = 57,491\n   - Row 3: Attendance = 37,419\n   - Row 4: Attendance = 18,104\n   - Row 5: Attendance = 38,264\n   - **Row 6**: Date: October 21, 1962; Attendance = 60,671 (Note this is another game with the specified attendance of 60,671)\n   - **Row 7**: Date: October 28, 1962; Attendance = 62,844 \n   - Row 8: Attendance = 49,888\n   - Row 9: Attendance = 48,169\n   - Row 10: Attendance = 21,231\n   - Row 11: Attendance = 49,219\n   - Row 12: Attendance = 32,229\n   - Row 13: Attendance = 56,964\n   - Row 14: Attendance = 34,508\n\n5. **Determine the Highest Attendance**:\n   - The highest attendance in the table is 62,844 for the game on October 28, 1962 (Row 7).\n\n6. **Verify if Any Other Game Matches or Exceeds 60,671 Attendance**:\n   - Row 6 has an attendance of 60,671.\n   - No other game exceeds this number.\n\nSince the claim is about October 28, 1962 having the highest attendance and it indeed does (62,844), we can conclude that the statement is true. Additionally, while there was another game with an attendance of 60,671 (Row 6), it doesn't affect the validity of the claim as October 28's attendance is higher.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that the game on October 28, 1962 has the highest attendance at 60,671.
