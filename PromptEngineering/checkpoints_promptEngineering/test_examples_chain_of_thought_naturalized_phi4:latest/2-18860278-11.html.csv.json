The international debut on the same date (or any other) was \"RU Five Nations v Ireland.\"\n\nLet's go through these steps systematically:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n- **Identify Relevant Information for Cross Code Debut:**\n  - We need to check if there is an entry in the table where the cross code debut date matches \"9 Oct 1948.\"\n  - According to Row 3, player Dave Valentine had a cross code debut on \"9 Oct 1948\" with the event being \"RL 1st test Great Britain v Australia.\" This matches the first part of the claim.\n\n- **Identify Relevant Information for International Debut:**\n  - We need to check if there is an entry in the table where the international debut was \"RU Five Nations v Ireland.\"\n  - According to Row 3, player Dave Valentine's international debut was \"RU Five Nations v Ireland\" in 1947. However, this does not match the specific date of \"9 Oct 1948.\"\n\n- **Verify Cross Date Consistency:**\n  - The claim implies that both events (cross code and international) happened on \"9 Oct 1948.\" \n  - From our analysis:\n    - Dave Valentine's cross code debut was indeed on \"9 Oct 1948.\"\n    - However, his international debut did not occur on this date; it happened in 1947.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false because while the cross code debut matches the given date and event, the international debut does not match the specified date of \"9 Oct 1948.\" The international debut for Dave Valentine was in 1947, not on the same date as his cross code debut.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that both the cross code and international debuts occurred on '9 Oct 1948.'
