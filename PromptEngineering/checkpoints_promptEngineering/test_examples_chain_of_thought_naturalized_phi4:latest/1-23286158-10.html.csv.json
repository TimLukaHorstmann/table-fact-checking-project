Therefore, he was the high scorer in more than one game.\n\n3. **Part 2 of the Claim: \"LaMarcus Aldridge be the high rebounder in zero game\"**\n   - We need to check which player had the highest rebounds in each game.\n     - Game 77 (April 3): High rebounds are by Marcus Camby with 15.\n     - Game 78 (April 7): High rebounds are by LaMarcus Aldridge with 12.\n     - Game 79 (April 9): High rebounds are by Marcus Camby with 18.\n     - Game 80 (April 11): High rebounds are by Marcus Camby with 17.\n     - Game 81 (April 12): High rebounds are by Marcus Camby with 13.\n   - LaMarcus Aldridge was the high rebounder in Game 78. Therefore, he was the high rebounder in one game.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that LaMarcus Aldridge was the high scorer in exactly 1 game and the high rebounder in zero games.\n   - Based on our analysis:\n     - He was the high scorer in 3 games (Games 78, 79, and 80).\n     - He was the high rebounder in 1 game (Game 78).\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect.
