    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to examine the table for a specific condition:\n\n1. **Identify the Condition**: The claim states that the away team scored 8.12 (60) when the home team scored 11.15 (81).\n\n2. **Check Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: Home team score is 10.17 (77), not 11.15 (81).\n   - **Row 2**: Home team score is 13.18 (96), not 11.15 (81).\n   - **Row 3**: Home team score is 9.19 (73), not 11.15 (81).\n   - **Row 4**: Home team score is 14.12 (96), not 11.15 (81).\n   - **Row 5**: Home team score is 12.11 (83), not 11.15 (81).\n   - **Row 6**: Home team score is 8.12 (60), not 11.15 (81).\n\n3. **Find the Row with Home Team Score of 11.15 (81)**:\n   - Only **Row 5** has a home team score of 11.15 (81).\n   - Check the away team score in Row 5: it is 11.15 (81), not 8.12 (60).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: There is no row where the home team scored 11.15 (81) and the away team scored 8.12 (60).
