    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down the claim and verify each part against the table data.\n\n**Claim Analysis:**\n1. The current tallest building is identified as \"Wells Fargo Center.\"\n2. Before the Wells Fargo Center, the building that held the title of the tallest for the longest time was the \"Public Service Building.\"\n3. The Public Service Building was the tallest for 45 years.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Tallest Building:**\n   - According to Row 9 in the table, the current tallest building is the \"Wells Fargo Center,\" which has been the tallest since 1972 to present.\n\n2. **Verify Longest Duration as Tallest Before Wells Fargo Center:**\n   - We need to examine each building's duration as the tallest before the Wells Fargo Center:\n     - **Public Service Building:** Years as tallest = 1927 - 1962 (35 years)\n     - **Hilton Portland Hotel:** Years as tallest = 1963 - 1965 (2 years)\n     - **Harrison West Condominium Tower:** Years as tallest = 1965 - 1969 (4 years)\n     - **Union Bank of California Tower:** Years as tallest = 1969 - 1970 (1 year)\n     - **Standard Insurance Center:** Years as tallest = 1970 - 1972 (2 years)\n\n3. **Determine Longest Duration:**\n   - From the durations above, the \"Public Service Building\" held the title for 35 years, which is indeed the longest duration among the buildings listed before the Wells Fargo Center.\n\n4. **Check Claimed Duration for Public Service Building:**\n   - The claim states that the Public Service Building was tallest for 45 years.\n   - However, from our verification, it was tallest only for 35 years (1927 to 1962).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim incorrectly states that the Public Service Building held the title for 45 years.
