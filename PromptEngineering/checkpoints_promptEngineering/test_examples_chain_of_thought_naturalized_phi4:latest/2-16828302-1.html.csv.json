Pletcher.\n\n4. **Conclude based on findings:**\n   - If both conditions are met (John Velazquez as jockey and Todd A. Pletcher as trainer), then the claim is TRUE.\n   - If either condition fails, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to the table:\n\n- **Step 1:** Find the row with \"time\" = 1:15.80.\n  - From Row 4: year: 2004, winner: alke, jockey: john velazquez, trainer: todd a pletcher, owner: k d english / a braun, time: 1:15.80.\n\n- **Step 2:** Check the \"jockey\" for this row.\n  - Row 4 has \"jockey\": John Velazquez.\n\n- **Step 3:** Check the \"trainer\" for this row.\n  - Row 4 has \"trainer\": Todd A. Pletcher.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied: John Velazquez is indeed the jockey, and Todd A.
