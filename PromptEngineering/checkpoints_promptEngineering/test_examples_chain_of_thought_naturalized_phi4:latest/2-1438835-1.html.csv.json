Therefore, the claim about the highest away score being 3 - 1 is FALSE.\n\n3. **Determine the Lowest Away Score:**\n   - Identify all instances of a 0 - 0 away score:\n     - Row 1 (1995-96 season): away score is 0 - 0.\n     - Row 2 (2001-02 season, first round): away score is 0 - 0.\n\n   - There are indeed two occurrences of a 0 - 0 away score: one in the 1995-96 season and another in the 2001-02 season. This part of the claim is TRUE.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The highest away score being 3 - 1 in the 2001-02 season is incorrect, making the entire claim FALSE despite the second part about the lowest away scores being accurate.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 1 (away): \"0 - 0\"\n- Row 2 (away): \"0 - 0\"\n- Row 3 (away): \"4 - 1\"\n- Row 4 (away): \"0 - 1\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The highest away score in the 2001-02 season is 4 - 1, not 3 - 1.
