Whether it was a 38 - 24 defeat by the Washington Redskins.\n\nLet's break down the process step-by-step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Losses:**\n   We first identify all the weeks where the team lost, which is indicated by \"result: l\".\n\n2. **Calculate Margin of Defeat:**\n   For each loss, calculate the margin by subtracting the team's score from the opponent's score.\n\n3. **Find the Worst Loss:**\n   Compare the margins to determine the largest deficit (worst loss).\n\n4. **Verify Opponent and Score:**\n   Check if the worst loss matches the claim of being a 38 - 24 defeat against the Washington Redskins.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n- **Week 5:** Loss to Buffalo Bills, score 26 - 24. Margin = 2.\n- **Week 6:** Loss to Oakland Raiders, score 38 - 24. Margin = 14.\n- **Week 8:** Loss to Dallas Cowboys, score 42 - 31. Margin = 11.\n- **Week 10:** Loss to Denver Broncos, score 20 - 13. Margin = 7.\n- **Week 14:** Loss to Washington Redskins, score 40 - 17. Margin = 23.\n\nThe largest margin of defeat is 23 points in Week 14 against the Washington Redskins.\n\n### Verification Against Claim\n\n- The claim states the worst loss was by 23 points due to a 38 - 24 defeat by the Washington Redskins.\n- From our analysis, the worst loss (23 points) occurred in Week 14 against the Washington Redskins, but the score was 40 - 17, not 38 - 24.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is false because the worst loss of 23 points was against the Washington Redskins, but the actual scores were different from those stated in the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify all losses by checking 'result: l'.\",\n    \"Calculate margin for each loss.\",\n    \"Determine the largest margin (worst loss).\",\n    \"Compare the worst loss to the claim's details.\",\n    \"Verify opponent and score match the claim.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
