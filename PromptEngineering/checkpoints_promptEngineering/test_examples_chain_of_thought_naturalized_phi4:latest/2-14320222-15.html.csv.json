    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Glen Seabrooke be the only player list who play the center position\" is true or false, we need to examine the table for any players listed as playing the center position.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Glen Seabrooke's Position:**\n   - From Row 1, we see that Glen Seabrooke is a player at the \"center\" position.\n   \n2. **Check Other Players' Positions:**\n   - **Row 2:** Bruce Rendall is listed as playing left wing.\n   - **Row 3:** Darryl Gilmour is listed as goaltender.\n   - **Row 4:** Shane Whelan is listed as center.\n   - **Row 5:** Paul Marshall is listed as defense.\n   - **Row 6:** Daril Holmes is listed as right wing.\n   - **Row 7:** Ken Alexander is listed as defense.\n   - **Row 8:** Tony Horacek is listed as left wing.\n   - **Row 9:** Mike Cusack is listed as forward (not specifically center).\n   - **Row 10:** Gord Murphy is listed as defense.\n   - **Row 11:** Rod Williams is listed as right wing.\n   - **Row 12:** Paul Maurice is listed as defense.\n\n3. **Identify Other Center Players:**\n   - In Row 4, Shane Whelan is also listed as a center.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Shane Whelan (Row 4) is another player listed as playing the center position, Glen Seabrooke is not the only player in this position.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Glen Seabrooke is listed as a center in Row 1. Checking other rows reveals that Shane Whelan in Row 4 is also listed as playing the center position, disproving the claim.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
