We need to find this date within our table.\n\n2. **Locate the Date in the Table**:\n   - Check each row's \"date\" column to find a match for October 16, 1983.\n   - According to Row 7: week: 7, date: October 16, 1983.\n\n3. **Verify the Opponent**: Once we have identified the correct row (Row 7), we need to check the \"opponent\" column in that same row.\n   - In Row 7, the opponent listed is \"Chicago Bears.\"\n\n4. **Check for Claim Accuracy**:\n   - The claim states that the Chicago Bears were the opponent on October 16, 1983.
