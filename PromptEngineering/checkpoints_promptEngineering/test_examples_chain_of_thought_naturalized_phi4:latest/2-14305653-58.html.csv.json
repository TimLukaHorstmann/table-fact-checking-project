This means that the type of competition stated in the claim does not align with the table.\n\n3. **Opponent Check:**\n   - The opponent mentioned in the claim is \"Poland,\" but from Row 1, we see that the opponent was \"Uruguay.\" Thus, the claimed opponent does not match the actual opponent in the table for March 22.\n\n4. **Result Check:**\n   - The result stated in the claim is a loss with a score of \"2:1.\" According to Row 1, the result on March 22 was actually a win with a score of \"2:1\" (Yugoslavia vs Uruguay). Hence, while the scores match numerically, the nature of the outcome (win vs. loss) does not.\n\n5. **Balkan Cup Check for 2:1 Loss:**\n   - We need to determine if there was any game in the Balkan Cup where Yugoslavia lost with a score of \"2:1.\" According to Row 4, there was a match against Romania on August 27 during the Balkan Cup, but the result was a loss with a score of \"1:4,\" not \"2:1.\"\n\n6. **Checking for Losses Against Poland in the Balkan Cup:**\n   - From Row 3, Yugoslavia did play against Poland and lost 2:1 on April 26, but this match was also a \"friendly\" game, not a Balkan Cup.\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n- The March 22 match details do not align with any part of the claim regarding opponent, type of game, or outcome.\n- There is no instance in the table where Yugoslavia lost to Poland with a score of 2:1 during the Balkan Cup.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is FALSE.
