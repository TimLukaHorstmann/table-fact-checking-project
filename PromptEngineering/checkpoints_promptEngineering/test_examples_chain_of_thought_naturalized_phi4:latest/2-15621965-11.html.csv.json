    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine if there are two players who played the position of center for Orlando from 1998 to 1999 according to the provided table.\n\n**Step-by-step Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify Players Who Played as Centers:**\n   - From the table, we look at each row and check the \"position\" column to find players listed as playing in the position of center.\n   - Row 1: Jason Lawson is listed as a center.\n\n2. **Check the Years They Played for Orlando:**\n   - For each player identified as a center, verify their years in Orlando from the \"years in orlando\" column.\n   - Row 1: Jason Lawson played from 1997 to 1998. This does not cover the full range of 1998 to 1999.\n\n3. **Determine if There are Two Players Fitting the Criteria:**\n   - We need two players who both played as centers and were in Orlando during the years 1998 to 1999.\n   - From step 1, only Jason Lawson is a center, and from step 2, he does not cover the full range of 1998 to 1999.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - There is only one player (Jason Lawson) who played as a center for Orlando, and his tenure does not fully encompass the years 1998 to 1999.\n   - Therefore, it is impossible for there to be two players meeting the criteria specified in the claim.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify players who played as centers. Only Jason Lawson fits this criterion. Next, check his years with Orlando (1997-1998), which do not cover 1998 to 1999 fully. Since only one player is identified and does not meet the full year requirement, there cannot be two such players.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"years in orlando\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
