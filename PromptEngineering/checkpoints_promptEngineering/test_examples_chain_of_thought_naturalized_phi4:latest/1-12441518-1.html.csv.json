    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"nick lucas only appear in the first season\" is TRUE or FALSE, let's analyze the information provided in the table:\n\n1. **Identify Nick Lucas' Information**:\n   - From Row 1: The character \"Nick Lucas\" is portrayed by \"Nick Jonas\".\n   - Main Cast Seasons: Nick Lucas is part of the main cast for \"seasons 1 - 2\".\n   - Recurring Cast Seasons: He \"appears in all seasons\".\n\n2. **Analyze the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that \"nick lucas only appear in the first season\". \n   - For this to be true, Nick Lucas should not appear in any other season except for the first.\n\n3. **Evaluate Against Table Data**:\n   - According to Row 1, Nick Lucas is part of the main cast from \"seasons 1 - 2\", indicating he appeared in both seasons.\n   - Additionally, it states that he \"appears in all seasons\" under recurring cast, reinforcing his presence beyond just the first season.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim contradicts the information provided in the table since Nick Lucas appears in more than just the first season (he is part of main and recurring casts from seasons 1 to 2).\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify Nick Lucas' Information: He is portrayed by Nick Jonas.\",\n    \"Main Cast Seasons: Nick Lucas is part of the main cast for 'seasons 1 - 2'.\",\n    \"Recurring Cast Seasons: He 'appears in all seasons'.\",\n    \"Analyze the Claim: The claim states that Nick Lucas only appears in the first season.\",\n    \"Evaluate Against Table Data: The table shows he appeared in both seasons 1 and 2, contradicting the claim.\",\n    \"Conclusion: The claim is FALSE as Nick Lucas appears beyond just the first season.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"main cast seasons\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"recurring cast seasons\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
