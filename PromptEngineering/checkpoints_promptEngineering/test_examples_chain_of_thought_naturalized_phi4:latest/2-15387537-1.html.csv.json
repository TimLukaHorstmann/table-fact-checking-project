    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"portuguesa tied the same amount of games as santos\" is true or false, we will examine the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - We need to find out how many games each team drew (tied).\n   - The column that contains this information in the table is labeled \"drawn.\"\n\n2. **Locate Data for Santos:**\n   - According to Row 4, the data for the team Santos is:\n     - Drawn: 3\n   - This means Santos tied 3 games.\n\n3. **Locate Data for Portuguesa:**\n   - According to Row 8, the data for the team Portuguesa is:\n     - Drawn: 2\n   - This indicates that Portuguesa tied 2 games.\n\n4. **Compare the Results:**\n   - Santos has drawn 3 games.\n   - Portuguesa has drawn 2 games.\n   - Since 3 (Santos) is not equal to 2 (Portuguesa), they did not tie the same number of games.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that \"portuguesa tied the same amount of games as santos\" is FALSE, based on the information in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. The relevant column to check for the number of draws (tied games) is 'drawn'.\\n2. Santos has drawn 3 games according to Row 4.\\n3. Portuguesa has drawn 2 games according to Row 8.\\n4. Since 3 does not equal 2, the claim that they tied the same number of games is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
