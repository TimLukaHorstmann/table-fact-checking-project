    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, we will examine the information from the table for the year 2003.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Year**: The claim refers to the year 2003. Locate row 8 in the table which corresponds to this year.\n\n2. **Check Men's Doubles Competition**:\n   - Look at the \"men 's doubles\" column for Row 8.\n   - The entry is \"no competition,\" indicating there was no men\u2019s doubles event in 2003.\n\n3. **Check Women's Doubles Competition**:\n   - Look at the \"women 's doubles\" column for Row 8.\n   - The entry is also \"no competition,\" indicating there was no women\u2019s doubles event in 2003.\n\n4. **Check Mixed Doubles Participation**:\n   - Look at the \"mixed doubles\" column for Row 8 to verify if Edgar Eremian participated.\n   - The entry states \"no competition,\" meaning there was no mixed doubles event, and therefore Edgar Eremian could not have participated in any mixed doubles.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that there was no competition for men\u2019s doubles and women\u2019s doubles, which is true based on the table. However, it also claims that Edgar Eremian played in the mixed doubles, which is false because there was no competition for mixed doubles in 2003.\n\nTherefore, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"For the year 2003, both men's and women's doubles had 'no competition.'
