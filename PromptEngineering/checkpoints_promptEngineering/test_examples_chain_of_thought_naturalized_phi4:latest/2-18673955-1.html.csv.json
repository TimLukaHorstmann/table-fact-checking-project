    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to analyze each part of the claim in relation to the data provided.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"there be no game that be play on october 30 , 1977 that be list greater than week 7.\"\n\n1. **Identify the Date and Week**: \n   - The date mentioned is October 30, 1977.\n   - We need to identify which row corresponds to this date.\n\n2. **Check for Corresponding Row**:\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 7: \"week: 7, date: october 30 , 1977, opponent: tampa bay buccaneers, result: w 20 - 10, attendance: 34700.\"\n   - October 30, 1977 corresponds to Week 7.\n\n3. **Interpret the Claim**:\n   - The claim suggests that there is no game listed for October 30, 1977, which is greater than Week 7.\n   - Since October 30, 1977, is already Week 7, it cannot be \"greater\" than itself.\n\n4. **Verify Other Rows**:\n   - Check if any other row has the date October 30, 1977.\n   - No other rows have this date; only Row 7 does.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is no game listed for a week number greater than Week 7 on October 30, 1977, the claim holds true.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that there is no game on October 30, 1977, listed in a week greater than Week 7. Row 7 corresponds to October 30, 1977, and is Week 7. No other row has this date, confirming the claim is true.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
