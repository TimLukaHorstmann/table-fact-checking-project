    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Rafael M\u00e1rquez not remaining scoreless in international competition in the years 2001, 2009, or 2012 is true or false, we need to examine the table for goals scored by him in those specific years.\n\n**Chain of Thought:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Years**: The claim concerns the years 2001, 2009, and 2012.\n   \n2. **Examine Each Year Individually**:\n   - **2001**: Check if there are any goals recorded for Rafael M\u00e1rquez in this year.\n   - **2009**: Check for any goals scored by him during this year.\n   - **2012**: Look for any entries that indicate goals scored by him in 2012.\n\n3. **Review the Table**:\n   - Go through each row to see if there are any dates within these years where Rafael M\u00e1rquez has scored a goal.\n\n4. **Analyze Each Relevant Year**:\n   - **2001**: \n     - There is no entry in the table for 2001. Hence, no goals were recorded.\n   - **2009**:\n     - Check each row to see if any match falls within 2009. The only entry close is Row 9 (28 March 2007), which does not fall within 2009.\n     - No entries are present for 2009.\n   - **2012**:\n     - Similarly, check each row to find any matches in 2012. There are no entries for this year.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there are no goals recorded by Rafael M\u00e1rquez in the years 2001, 2009, or 2012, he did remain scoreless during international competitions in these years.\n   - The claim states that he \"do not remain scoreless,\" which is false based on our analysis.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table does not have any entries for the years 2001, 2009, or 2012 where Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal. Therefore, he remained scoreless in international competitions during these years.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
