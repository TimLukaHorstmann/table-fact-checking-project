    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Years with Goodyear Tyres:**\n   - The claim mentions a 6-year run on \"goodyear\" tyres. We need to identify which years in the table used \"g\" (Goodyear) tyres.\n   - Review each row and check the \"tyres\" column for the letter \"g\".\n\n2. **List the Relevant Years:**\n   - From the table:\n     - Year 1975: Tyres \"g\"\n     - Year 1976: Tyres \"g\"\n     - Year 1977: Tyres \"g\"\n     - Year 1978: Tyres \"g\"\n     - Year 1979: Tyres \"g\"\n\n3. **Verify the Duration of Goodyear Use:**\n   - The years identified with \"g\" tyres are 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, and 1979.\n   - This is a consecutive 5-year period, not 6 years as claimed.\n\n4. **Check Points Earned in These Years:**\n   - Year 1975: Points = 1\n   - Year 1976: Points = 2\n   - Year 1977: Points = 10\n   - Year 1978: Points = 1\n   - Year 1979: Points = 0\n\n5. **Count the Years with Points Earned:**\n   - In these years, points were earned in:\n     - 1975 (1 point)\n     - 1976 (2 points)\n     - 1977 (10 points)\n     - 1978 (1 point)\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states \"in the 6 year run on goodyear, ensign racing earn point in 3 years.\"\n   - We found a 5-year period with Goodyear tyres, not 6.\n   - In these 5 years, points were earned in 4 years (1975, 1976, 1977, and 1978).\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is false because the run was for 5 years, not 6, and points were earned in 4 of those years, not 3.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify years with 'g' tyres (Goodyear): 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979.\",\n    \"Verify the duration: These are 5 consecutive years, not 6 as claimed.\",\n    \"Check points earned in these years: Points were earned in 1975, 1976, 1977, and 1978.\",\n    \"Count the years with points: Points were earned in 4 of the 5 years.\",\n    \"Evaluate the claim: The claim is false because the run was for 5 years (not 6), and points were earned in 4 years (not 3).\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
