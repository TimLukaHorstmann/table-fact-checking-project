    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to analyze the provided table data focusing on specific metrics: viewers (in millions), rating/share for 18-49 demographics, and their relationships.\n\n**Step-by-step Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify the Entry with Rating/Share 3.2 / 8**: \n   - According to the claim, we need to find an entry where \"rating / share (18 - 49)\" is \"3.2 / 8\".\n   - From the table, Row 6 has \"rating / share (18 - 49): 3.2 / 8\".\n\n2. **Check Viewers for this Entry**: \n   - In Row 6, \"viewers (millions)\": 12.42.\n   - We need to confirm whether there are any entries with viewers greater than 12.42 million.\n\n3. **Compare Viewers Across All Entries**:\n   - Row 1: 9.2 million\n   - Row 2: 7.81 million\n   - Row 3: 10.6 million\n   - Row 4: 10.13 million\n   - Row 5: 10.33 million\n   - **Row 6**: 12.42 million (the entry with \"rating / share 3.2 / 8\")\n   - Row 7: 11.97 million\n   - Row 8: 10.58 million\n   - Row 9: 10.31 million\n   - Row 10: 10.27 million\n   - Row 11: 10.84 million\n   - Row 12: 12.49 million\n\n4. **Determine if Any Entry Exceeds 12.42 Million Viewers**:\n   - From the comparison, only Row 12 has \"viewers (millions)\": 12.49.\n   - Therefore, there is an entry with more than 12.42 million viewers.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states that there are more than 12.42 million viewers for the entry with rating/share 3.2 / 8, which refers to Row 6. \n   - While Row 6 has exactly 12.42 million viewers, Row 12 does have more than 12.42 million viewers.\n   - The claim's phrasing might imply an entry other than Row 6 exceeding 12.42 million; however, based on context, the logical interpretation aligns with checking if any entries in general exceed this number.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The task was to identify whether there is more than 12.42 million viewers for the entry with a rating/share of 3.2/8 (Row 6). While Row 6 has exactly 12.42 million viewers, another row (Row 12) exceeds this number. Thus, the claim that there are entries with more than 12.42 million viewers holds true.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"rating / share (18 - 49)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"viewers (millions)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
