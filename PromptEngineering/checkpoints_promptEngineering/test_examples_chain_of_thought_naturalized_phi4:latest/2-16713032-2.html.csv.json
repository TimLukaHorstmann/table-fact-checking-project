The table states the attendance as 60,488 for Week 5, which matches the claim.\n\n4. **Verify Result and Score**: Verify the game's outcome and score from Row 5:\n   - Result is noted as \"l\" (loss), which aligns with the claim.\n   - The score listed is \"24-20\", matching exactly what is claimed.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since both the attendance figure, result, and score in Week 5 match those specified in the claim, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - Row index: 5\n   - Columns relevant to the claim are \"attendance\" with value 60488, \"result\" with value \"l\", and part of the result string with score \"24-20\".\n\nBased on this reasoning:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table row for Week 5 confirms that the attendance was 60,488, the result was a loss ('l'), and the score was 24-20.
