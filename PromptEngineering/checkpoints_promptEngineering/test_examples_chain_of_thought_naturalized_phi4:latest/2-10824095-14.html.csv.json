    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the crowd for Essendon's home game on June 26, 1952, is true or false, we need to analyze the given table for relevant information.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information in the Claim:**\n   - The claim mentions a specific date: June 26, 1952.\n   - It also specifies an event involving the Essendon home team and a crowd size of 74,656.\n\n2. **Examine the Table for Date:**\n   - All entries in the table are from June 26, 1982. Therefore, there is no entry for June 26, 1952.\n\n3. **Check for Essendon's Home Game:**\n   - In Row 6 of the table, Essendon is listed as the home team with a crowd size of 47,656.\n   - This event occurred on June 26, 1982, not 1952.\n\n4. **Compare Crowd Size:**\n   - The claim states a crowd of 74,656 for Essendon's game.\n   - According to Row 6, the actual crowd was 47,656 for their game on June 26, 1982.\n\n5. **Conclusion Based on Analysis:**\n   - There is no entry in the table for June 26, 1952.\n   - The claimed crowd size of 74,656 does not match any recorded data in the table, even for the Essendon game on June 26, 1982.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim refers to a date (June 26, 1952) and crowd size (74,656) not present in the table.
