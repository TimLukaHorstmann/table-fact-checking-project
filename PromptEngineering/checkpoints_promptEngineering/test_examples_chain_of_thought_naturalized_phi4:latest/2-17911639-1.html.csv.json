    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Euro 2000 qualifying be the competition when the score be 3 - 0\" is true or false, we need to examine each row of the table where the competition is listed as \"euro 2000 qualifying.\" We will check if any of these rows have a score of \"3 - 0.\"\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Euro 2000 Qualifying:**\n   - Look for rows in the table where the competition column states \"euro 2000 qualifying.\"\n\n2. **Examine Scores in Identified Rows:**\n   - For each row identified, check the score column to see if it matches \"3 - 0.\"\n\n3. **Check Each Relevant Row:**\n\n   - **Row 1:** \n     - Date: 5 June 1999\n     - Venue: Tofiq Bahramov Stadium, Baku\n     - Score: 3 - 0\n     - Result: 4 - 0\n     - Competition: Euro 2000 qualifying\n     - The score is \"3 - 0\" and the competition matches \"Euro 2000 qualifying.\"\n\n   - **Row 3:** \n     - Date: 4 September 1999\n     - Venue: Tofiq Bahramov Stadium, Baku\n     - Score: 1 - 0\n     - Result: 1 - 1\n     - Competition: Euro 2000 qualifying\n     - The score is \"1 - 0,\" which does not match the required \"3 - 0.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - In Row 1, both the competition and the score match the claim.\n   - Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified rows with 'Euro 2000 qualifying' as the competition.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Euro 2001 qualifying be the competition when the score be 3 - 1\" is true or false, we need to examine each row of the table for two specific conditions: \n\n1. The competition must be \"euro 2001 qualifying.\"\n2. The score must be \"3 - 1.\"\n\nLet's analyze each row step by step:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Competition: \"euro 2000 qualifying\"\n  - Score: \"3 - 0\"\n  - This row does not match either condition.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Competition: \"friendly\"\n  - Score: \"3 - 1\"\n  - The score matches, but the competition does not. \n\n- **Row 3**: \n  - Competition: \"euro 2000 qualifying\"\n  - Score: \"1 - 0\"\n  - This row does not match either condition.\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Competition: \"friendly\"\n  - Score: \"1 - 0\"\n  - Neither the competition nor the score matches.\n\n- **Row 5**: \n  - Competition: \"2002 world cup qualification\"\n  - Score: \"2 - 0\"\n  - This row does not match either condition.\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Competition: \"friendly\"\n  - Score: \"0 - 1\"\n  - Neither the competition nor the score matches.\n\nAfter reviewing all rows, none of them have both \"euro 2001 qualifying\" as the competition and \"3 - 1\" as the score. \n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there is no entry in the table that satisfies both conditions simultaneously.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Reviewed each row for a match with 'euro 2001 qualifying' competition and '3 - 1' score.
