We are looking for rows where \"family\" is set as \"unassigned\".\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - Check each row's \"family\" column to see if it contains the value \"unassigned\".\n   \n3. **Identify Unassigned Families**:\n   - Row 22: The family is listed as \"unassigned\". This matches our condition.\n\n4. **Count Rows with Unassigned Family**:\n   - From the examination, only one row (Row 22) has \"family\" as \"unassigned\".\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since only one row has an unassigned family, the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cell for this analysis is in Row 22 under the column \"family\", which contains the value \"unassigned\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that only one viral disease has an unassigned family.
