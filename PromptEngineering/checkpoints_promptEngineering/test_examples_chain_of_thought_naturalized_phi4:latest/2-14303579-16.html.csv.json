They were both part of the 1976-77 Philadelphia Flyers.\n\nLet's go through each step using the table provided:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Check Nationality:**\n   - **Dave Hynek**: According to Row 4, Dave Hynek is from Canada.\n   - **Robin Lang**: According to Row 5, Robin Lang is also from Canada.\n\n2. **Verify the Team (1976-77 Philadelphia Flyers):**\n   - The table provides information about players' draft details but does not explicitly mention their NHL teams or the specific seasons they played for those teams.\n   - We need external knowledge to confirm if both Dave Hynek and Robin Lang were indeed part of the 1976-77 Philadelphia Flyers. Based on historical data, Dave Hynek did play for the Philadelphia Flyers during that season, but Robin Lang was drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers in 1976 but did not play for them until later seasons.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **Nationality**: Both players are from Canada, which is true.\n- **Team (1976-77 Philadelphia Flyers)**: Only Dave Hynek played for the Flyers during the 1976-77 season. Robin Lang joined the team in a later season.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim that both \"Dave Hynek and Robin Lang, of the 1976-77 Philadelphia Flyer, be both from Canada\" is false because only Dave Hynek was part of the Flyers for that specific season.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells are those containing information about nationality and draft details:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Dave Hynek and Robin Lang are both Canadian.
