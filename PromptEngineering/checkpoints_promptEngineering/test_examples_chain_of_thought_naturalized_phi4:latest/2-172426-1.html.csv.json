    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"princess mary of charles i died before she turned 25\" is true or false, let's analyze the relevant information from the table:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - We need to find information about Princess Mary related to Charles I.\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 1 lists \"Mary\" with name dates \"1631 - 1660\".\n     - Her parent is listed as \"Charles I 1600 - 1649\".\n\n2. **Calculate Age at Death:**\n   - Princess Mary was born in 1631 and died in 1660.\n   - To calculate her age at death, subtract the birth year from the death year:\n     \\[\n     1660 - 1631 = 29\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, Princess Mary died at the age of 29.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that she died before turning 25.\n   - Since she was actually 29 years old when she died, the claim is false.\n\n4. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - From Row 1:\n     - \"name dates\": \"mary , princess royal 1631 - 1660\"\n     - \"parent\": \"charles i 1600 - 1649\"\n\nBased on this analysis, we conclude that the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Princess Mary was born in 1631 and died in 1660.
