Burger was indeed playing on February 19, 2003, according to the data in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:** \n   - We need to look at the \"date\" column to find the entry for February 19, 2003.\n   \n2. **Check Date Column:**\n   - Go through each row and check if any row has the date \"19 - 02 - 2003.\"\n\n3. **Locate Row with Correct Date:**\n   - Upon examining the table:\n     - Row 1 has the date \"10 - 03 - 2003.\"\n     - Row 2 has the date \"12 - 02 - 2003.\"\n     - Row 3 has the date \"19 - 02 - 2003.\" (This is a match)\n     - Rows 4 to 8 have dates other than \"19 - 02 - 2003.\"\n\n4. **Verify Player in Correct Date Row:**\n   - In Row 3, which corresponds to the date \"19 - 02 - 2003,\" check the player column.\n   - The player listed is \"lj burger.\"\n\n5. **Conclude Verification:**\n   - Since L.J.
