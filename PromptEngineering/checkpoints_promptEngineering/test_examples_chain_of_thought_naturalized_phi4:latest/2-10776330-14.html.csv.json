    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"geelong be the home team several time\" is true or false, we need to examine the table data for instances where Geelong is listed as the home team.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: \n   - The claim states that Geelong was the home team multiple times on 29 July 1961.\n   \n2. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - We need to look at the \"home team\" column in each row of the table to see how many times Geelong appears.\n\n3. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: \n     - Home Team: Geelong\n     - This is one instance where Geelong is the home team.\n   - **Row 2**:\n     - Home Team: Fitzroy\n     - Geelong does not appear here.\n   - **Row 3**:\n     - Home Team: South Melbourne\n     - Geelong does not appear here.\n   - **Row 4**:\n     - Home Team: Melbourne\n     - Geelong does not appear here.\n   - **Row 5**:\n     - Home Team: North Melbourne\n     - Geelong does not appear here.\n   - **Row 6**:\n     - Home Team: Footscray\n     - Geelong does not appear here.\n\n4. **Count the Instances**:\n   - Geelong appears as the home team only once (in Row 1).\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Geelong was the home team \"several times.\" In this context, \"several\" typically means more than two or three instances.\n   - Since Geelong is listed as the home team only once, the claim does not hold true.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the data, the claim that Geelong was the home team several times is FALSE.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Geelong appears as the home team only once in Row 1 of the table. The term 'several' implies more than two or three occurrences. Since there is only one instance, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
