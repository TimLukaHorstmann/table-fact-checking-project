    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"Roger Vadim directed La Ronde in 1966,\" we need to examine the information given in the table for any mention of Roger Vadim, the film title \"La Ronde\" (both English and original), and the year 1966. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information**: We are looking for a row where:\n   - The director is Roger Vadim.\n   - The English title or original title matches \"La Ronde.\"\n   - The year of release is 1965 (as per the claim, we need to find if it was directed in 1966).\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**: We will check each row for these details:\n   - **Row 4** has the director listed as Roger Vadim.\n   - The English title in Row 4 is \"Circle of Love.\"\n   - The original title in Row 4 is \"La Ronde.\"\n   - The year in Row 4 is 1965.\n\n3. **Cross-Check Against the Claim**: According to the table, \"Roger Vadim directed La Ronde,\" but it was done in 1965, not 1966 as claimed. Therefore, the claim that he directed \"La Ronde\" in 1966 is false.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The correct year of direction for \"La Ronde\" by Roger Vadim, based on the table, is 1965, not 1966. Thus, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells from the table include:\n- Row 4: Year (1965), English Title (\"circle of love\"), Original Title (\"la ronde\"), Director (\"roger vadim\").\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table indicates that Roger Vadim directed 'La Ronde' in 1965.
