We will find this information by checking the \"tv broadcast\" column for \"s07e04.\"\n\n2. **Locate the Episode Details**:\n   - From the table, locate the row where \"tv broadcast: s07e04.\"\n   - This corresponds to Row 4.\n\n3. **Check the Original Air Date**:\n   - In Row 4, check the \"originalairdate\" column to see if it matches October 4, 2008.\n\n4. **Compare with the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the original air date is October 4, 2008.\n   - Verify if this matches the information in Row 4.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - If the \"originalairdate\" in Row 4 is indeed October 4, 2008, then the claim is true.\n   - Otherwise, it is false.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the table:\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the relevant row for \"tv broadcast: s07e04,\" which is Row 4.\n- **Step 2 & 3**: In Row 4, check the \"originalairdate\" column.
