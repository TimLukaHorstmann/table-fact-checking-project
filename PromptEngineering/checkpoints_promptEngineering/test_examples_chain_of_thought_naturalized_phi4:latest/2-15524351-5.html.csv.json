    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the deacon be shutout 3 time, but never by more than 10 point\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table for instances where the team was shut out (resulting in a score of '0') and verify if there are exactly three such occurrences. Additionally, we must ensure that each shutout loss did not exceed a margin of 10 points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Shutouts:**\n   - A shutout occurs when the team scores 0 points.\n   - We will look at the \"result\" column for entries where the score is '0'.\n\n2. **Count the Number of Shutouts:**\n   - We need to confirm there are exactly three instances of shutouts.\n\n3. **Check Margin of Each Shutout:**\n   - For each shutout, calculate the margin by subtracting the team's score from the opponent's score.\n   - Ensure that no shutout has a margin greater than 10 points.\n\n4. **Review Relevant Rows:**\n   - **Row 4:** Result is 'l 0 - 23'. The margin is 23 points.\n     - This is a shutout, but the margin exceeds 10 points.\n   - **Row 6:** Result is 'l 0 - 21'. The margin is 21 points.\n     - This is a shutout, but the margin exceeds 10 points.\n   - **Row 7:** Result is 'l 0 - 31'. The margin is 31 points.\n     - This is a shutout, and the margin exceeds 10 points.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - There are three instances of being shut out (Rows 4, 6, and 7).\n   - However, all these shutouts have margins greater than 10 points.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false because although there are three shutouts, none were by a margin of 10 points or less.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- **Row 4:** Result 'l 0 - 23'\n- **Row 6:** Result 'l 0 - 21'\n- **Row 7:** Result 'l 0 - 31'\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified three shutouts in Rows 4, 6, and 7.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the highest number of points anyone scored was below 50\" is true or false, we need to examine each row in the table for the scores provided in the \"result\" column. Specifically, we will focus on identifying the highest point total that any team scored in a single game.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Scores**: Extract the points scored by each team from the \"result\" column of every row.\n   - Row 1: Result is \"w 26 - 20\", so the home team (winning team) scored 26 points.\n   - Row 2: Result is \"l 10 - 56\", so the home team scored 10 points.\n   - Row 3: Result is \"l 6 - 45\", so the home team scored 6 points.\n   - Row 4: Result is \"l 0 - 23\", so the home team scored 0 points.\n   - Row 5: Result is \"l 13 - 42\", so the home team scored 13 points.\n   - Row 6: Result is \"l 0 - 21\", so the home team scored 0 points.\n   - Row 7: Result is \"l 0 - 31\", so the home team scored 0 points.\n   - Row 8: Result is \"l 3 - 35\", so the home team scored 3 points.\n   - Row 9: Result is \"w 9 - 7\", so the home team (winning team) scored 9 points.\n   - Row 10: Result is \"l 12 - 15\", so the home team scored 12 points.\n   - Row 11: Result is \"l 9 - 44\", so the home team scored 9 points.\n\n2. **Identify Opponent Scores**: Extract the scores of opponents from the \"result\" column where they are mentioned as second numbers.\n   - Row 1: The opponent (away) team scored 20 points.\n   - Row 2: The away team scored 56 points.\n   - Row 3: The away team scored 45 points.\n   - Row 4: The away team scored 23 points.\n   - Row 5: The away team scored 42 points.\n   - Row 6: The away team scored 21 points.\n   - Row 7: The away team scored 31 points.\n   - Row 8: The away team scored 35 points.\n   - Row 9: The away team scored 7 points.\n   - Row 10: The away team scored 15 points.\n   - Row 11: The away team scored 44 points.\n\n3. **Determine the Highest Score**: Compare all extracted scores to find the highest number of points scored by either a home or away team in any game.\n   - Home Team Scores: 26, 10, 6, 0, 13, 0, 0, 3, 9, 12, 9\n   - Away Team Scores: 20, 56, 45, 23, 42, 21, 31, 35, 7, 15, 44\n   - The highest score from the home team is 26 points.\n   - The highest score from the away team is 56 points.\n\n4. **Evaluate Claim**: The claim states that no one scored more than 49 points. However, we found an instance where a team scored 56 points (the opponent in Row 2).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim \"the highest number of points anyone scored was below 50\" is false because there is a game where the score was 56 by the opposing team.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Extracted scores for both home and away teams from each row's result column.
