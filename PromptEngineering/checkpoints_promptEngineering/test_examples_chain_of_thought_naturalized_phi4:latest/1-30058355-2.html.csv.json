    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to compare the recorded times and speeds for specific dates for a particular rider.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Rider**:\n   - The claim refers to times on \"mon 22 aug\" and \"wed 24 aug\". We need to identify which row corresponds to this information.\n   - From the table, we see that Dan Sayle (row 9) has entries for both these dates.\n\n2. **Check Monday's Entry**:\n   - For Dan Sayle on \"mon 22 aug\", the entry is: `20'22.05 111.148 mph`.\n   - The claim states: \"when mon 22 aug be 19'56.16 113.553 mph\". This does not match Dan Sayle's recorded time and speed for that day.\n\n3. **Check Wednesday's Entry**:\n   - For Dan Sayle on \"wed 24 aug\", the entry is: `19'56.16 113.553 mph`.\n   - The claim states: \"20'22.05 111.148 mph show for wed 24 aug\". This does not match Dan Sayle's recorded time and speed for that day.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The times and speeds mentioned in the claim do not align with the entries for Dan Sayle on either Monday or Wednesday.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim refers to specific times and speeds on 'mon 22 aug' and 'wed 24 aug'.
