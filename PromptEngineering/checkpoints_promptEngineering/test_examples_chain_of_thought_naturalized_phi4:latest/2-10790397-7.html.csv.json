This does not match \"essendon\".\n   - **Row 5**: Venue is \"mcg\". This does not match \"essendon\".\n   - **Row 6**: Venue is \"junction oval\". This does not match \"essendon\".\n\n4. **Conclusion**: None of the rows list Essendon as a venue by name. Even though Windy Hill is associated with Essendon, it's listed in the table as \"windy hill\" rather than \"essendon\".\n\n5. **Final Decision**: The claim that \"essendon be 1 of the 6 venue that be put to use on 10 june 1933\" is FALSE because none of the venues are named specifically as Essendon.\n\n### Relevant Data:\n- Row 3: Although not explicitly \"Essendon,\" it is noteworthy that Windy Hill is a venue associated with the Essendon Football Club.\n\nHere's the JSON formatted answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states 'essendon' was used as a venue name on 10 June 1933. Checking each row, no venue is explicitly named 'Essendon.' Row 3 lists 'windy hill,' associated with Essendon but not listed by that club's name.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
