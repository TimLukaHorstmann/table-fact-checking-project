Confirm whether \"Trafton\" is indeed the most recent episode among those directed by him.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n- **Identify Episodes Directed by Bernard Mceveety:**  \n  - We need to go through each row and find entries where the director is \"bernard mceveety.\"\n\n- **Check the Airdate of Each Episode Directed by Bernard Mceveety:**\n  - After identifying these episodes, we will compare their airdates to determine which one aired last.\n\n**Checking Rows for Director:**\n\n1. **Row 6:**  \n   - Director: \"bernard mceveety\"  \n   - Title: \"trafton\"\n   - Airdate: October 25, 1971\n\n2. **Row 11:**  \n   - Director: \"bernard mceveety\"  \n   - Title: \"gold train : the bullet - part 1\"\n   - Airdate: November 29, 1971\n\n3. **Row 12:**  \n   - Director: \"bernard mceveety\"  \n   - Title: \"gold train : the bullet - part 2\"\n   - Airdate: December 6, 1971\n\n4. **Row 13:**  \n   - Director: \"bernard mceveety\"  \n   - Title: \"gold train : the bullet - part 3\"\n   - Airdate: December 13, 1971\n\n5. **Row 17:**  \n   - Director: \"bernard mceveety\"  \n   - Title: \"tara\"\n   - Airdate: January 17, 1972\n\n6. **Row 18:**  \n   - Director: \"bernard mceveety\"  \n   - Title: \"one for the road\"\n   - Airdate: January 24, 1972\n\n7. **Row 19:**  \n   - Director: \"bernard mceveety\"  \n   - Title: \"the predators\"\n   - Airdate: January 31, 1972\n\n**Determine Most Recent Episode:**\n\n- Compare the airdates of all episodes directed by Bernard Mceveety:\n  - Trafton: October 25, 1971\n  - Gold Train: The Bullet - Part 1: November 29, 1971\n  - Gold Train: The Bullet - Part 2: December 6, 1971\n  - Gold Train: The Bullet - Part 3: December 13, 1971\n  - Tara: January 17, 1972\n  - One for the Road: January 24, 1972\n  - The Predators: January 31, 1972\n\n- The most recent episode directed by Bernard Mceveety is \"The Predators,\" which aired on January 31, 1972.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The claim states that \"Trafton\" is the most recent episode directed by Bernard Mceveety. However, \"The Predators\" is more recent.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified episodes directed by Bernard Mceveety and compared their airdates to determine the most recent one.
