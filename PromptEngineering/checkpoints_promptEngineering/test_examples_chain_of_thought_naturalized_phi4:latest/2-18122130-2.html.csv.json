    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Sandy Lyle's finish compared to Mark Calcavecchia's score is true or false, we will analyze the relevant data from the table provided:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We need to find the \"to par\" scores for both Sandy Lyle and Mark Calcavecchia as these indicate how many strokes they finished relative to par.\n\n2. **Extract Data for Sandy Lyle:**\n   - From Row 2 (Sandy Lyle), we see:\n     - \"to par\": -4\n   - This means Sandy Lyle finished 4 strokes under par.\n\n3. **Extract Data for Mark Calcavecchia:**\n   - From Row 5 (Mark Calcavecchia), we see:\n     - \"to par\": +1\n   - This means Mark Calcavecchia finished 1 stroke over par.\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference in Scores:**\n   - The difference between Sandy Lyle's and Mark Calcavecchia's scores is calculated by subtracting Mark Calcavecchia's \"to par\" score from Sandy Lyle's:\n     \\[\n     (-4) - (+1) = -4 - 1 = -5\n     \\]\n   - This calculation shows that Sandy Lyle finished 5 strokes better than Mark Calcavecchia.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"Sandy Lyle finish with a score 7 stroke better than Mark Calcavecchia's score.\"\n   - Based on our calculations, Sandy Lyle finished 5 strokes better, not 7.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the calculated difference is 5 strokes and not 7, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
