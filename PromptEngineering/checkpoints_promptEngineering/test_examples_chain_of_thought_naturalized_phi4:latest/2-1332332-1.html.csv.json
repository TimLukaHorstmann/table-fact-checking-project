Therefore, a week and a half would be 10.5 days.\n   - The series took 6 calendar days to complete (from start of the first game to end of the last game).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the duration from October 8 to October 14 is only 6 days, it does not constitute \"a week and a half\" (10.5 days).\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 1, Date: October 8\n- Row 2, Date: October 9\n- Row 3, Date: October 11\n- Row 4, Date: October 12\n- Row 5, Date: October 14\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The games in the series took place from October 8 to October 14.
