Among those games where Danny Granger led in scoring, at least 3 were home games for the Pacers.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n#### Identify Games Led by Danny Granger\n1. **Row 2**: Danny Granger was the leading scorer with 32 points.\n2. **Row 4**: Danny Granger led with 17 points.\n3. **Row 8**: Danny Granger scored 29 points, leading the game.\n4. **Row 9**: Danny Granger had 26 points as the lead scorer.\n5. **Row 11**: Danny Granger scored 33 points, being the highest.\n\nFrom this information, we can confirm that Danny Granger was indeed the leading scorer in 5 games (Rows 2, 4, 8, 9, and 11).\n\n#### Identify if These Games Were Home Games\n- **Row 2**: The game was a home game for Pacers against Hawks.\n- **Row 4**: This was a road game for Pacers at Jazz.\n- **Row 8**: This was a home game for Pacers against Warriors.\n- **Row 9**: This was a home game for Pacers against Kings.\n- **Row 11**: This was a home game for Pacers against Bulls.\n\nThus, Danny Granger led in scoring during four of these games as home games (Rows 2, 8, 9, and 11).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim states that Danny Granger was the leading scorer in most games (5), with at least 3 being home games. The analysis confirms:\n- Danny Granger led in 5 games.\n- He was the leading scorer for 4 of those as home games.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified that Danny Granger was the leading scorer in 5 games.
