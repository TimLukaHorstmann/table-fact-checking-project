    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the brm type 15 take part in 4 different races on the albi circuit\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table for entries related to the Albi circuit.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Circuits:**\n   - The claim involves the Albi circuit. Therefore, we need to find rows where the \"circuit\" column contains \"albi\".\n\n2. **Check for BRM Type 15:**\n   - The claim mentions the BRM Type 15. However, the table does not include a specific column for car models like \"BRM Type 15\". We must assume that the presence of certain drivers or events might imply involvement with specific cars.\n\n3. **Count Unique Events at Albi Circuit:**\n   - For each row where the circuit is \"albi\", determine if it represents a unique event by examining the \"event\" column.\n\n4. **List Relevant Rows:**\n   - Identify rows that mention the Albi circuit and count the distinct events listed.\n\n### Analysis of Table:\n\n- **Row 22:** Date: 1st June 1952, Event: grand prix de l'albigeois, Circuit: albi\n- **Row 23:** Same as Row 22 (same event)\n- **Row 30:** Date: 31st May 1953, Event: grand prix de l'albigeois qualifying heat, Circuit: albi\n- **Row 31:** Same as Row 30 (same event)\n- **Row 32:** Same as Row 30 (same event)\n- **Row 33:** Date: 31st May 1953, Event: grand prix de l'albigeois final, Circuit: albi\n- **Row 34:** Same as Row 33 (same event)\n- **Row 35:** Same as Row 33 (same event)\n\nFrom the above analysis:\n- There are two distinct events at the Albi circuit:\n  1. Grand Prix de l'Albigeois (Rows 22 and 23)\n  2. Grand Prix de l'Albigeois Qualifying Heat (Rows 30, 31, and 32)\n  3. Grand Prix de l'Albigeois Final (Rows 33, 34, and 35)\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe table shows three distinct events at the Albi circuit, not four as claimed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified rows with 'albi' in the 'circuit' column.
