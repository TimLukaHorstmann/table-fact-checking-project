    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to examine the number of steals and blocks for each player listed in the data provided. The goal is to determine if LeBron James has more steals and blocks combined than any other player mentioned.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify relevant columns:** We will focus on the \"steals\" and \"blocks\" columns for all players, as these directly relate to the claim about LeBron James having the highest number of steals and blocks.\n\n2. **Extract data for each player:** \n   - For each row (representing a player), sum the values in the \"steals\" and \"blocks\" columns.\n   \n3. **Compare totals:**\n   - Calculate the total for LeBron James by adding his steals and blocks from his corresponding row.\n   - Compare this total with the sums of other players' steals and blocks.\n\n4. **Check the claim:** \n   - If LeBron James's combined total of steals and blocks is greater than that of every other player listed, then the claim is true.\n   - Otherwise, it is false.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- LeBron James (Row 30): Steals = 1, Blocks = 1; Total = 1 + 1 = 2\n- Michael Jordan:\n  - Row 21: Steals = 6, Blocks = 0; Total = 6 + 0 = 6\n  - Row 22: Steals = 3, Blocks = 3; Total = 3 + 3 = 6\n  - Row 23: Steals = 5, Blocks = 0; Total = 5 + 0 = 5\n  - Row 24: Steals = 8, Blocks = 0; Total = 8 + 0 = 8\n  - Row 25: Steals = 3, Blocks = 3; Total = 3 + 3 = 6\n  - Row 26: Steals = 5, Blocks = 1; Total = 5 + 1 = 6\n  - Row 27: Steals = 8, Blocks = 0; Total = 8 + 0 = 8\n- Hakeem Olajuwon (Row 29): Steals = 3, Blocks = 3; Total = 3 + 3 = 6\n- Karl Malone (Row 26): Steals = 2, Blocks = 0; Total = 2 + 0 = 2\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nLeBron James's combined total of steals and blocks is 2.
