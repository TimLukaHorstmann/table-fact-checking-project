    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Jackie Oliver competed in 13 races from 1967 - 1977\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table for any entries associated with Jackie Oliver as an entrant during that period.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Time Frame**: The claim specifies a time frame from 1967 to 1977. We will check each row in this range.\n   \n2. **Check Each Row for Entrant Name**: We need to examine the \"entrant\" column of each row within the specified years (1967-1977) to see if Jackie Oliver is mentioned.\n\n3. **Count Relevant Entries**:\n   - **Row 1 (1967)**: Entrant is \"lotus components ltd\". No mention of Jackie Oliver.\n   - **Row 2 (1968)**: Entrant is \"gold leaf team lotus\". No mention of Jackie Oliver.\n   - **Row 3 (1968)**: Entrant is \"gold leaf team lotus\". No mention of Jackie Oliver.\n   - **Rows 4, 5, 6 (1969)**: Entrant is \"owen racing organisation\". No mention of Jackie Oliver.\n   - **Rows 7, 8 (1970)**: Entrants are \"owen racing organisation\" and \"yardley team brm\". No mention of Jackie Oliver.\n   - **Rows 9, 10 (1971)**: Entrant is \"bruce mclaren motor racing\". No mention of Jackie Oliver.\n   - **Row 11 (1972)**: Entrant is \"marlboro brm\". No mention of Jackie Oliver.\n   - **Row 12 (1973)**: Entrant is \"uop shadow racing team\". No mention of Jackie Oliver.\n   - **Row 13 (1977)**: Entrant is \"shadow racing team\". No mention of Jackie Oliver.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Throughout the table, there are no entries where Jackie Oliver is listed as an entrant from 1967 to 1977. Therefore, based on this table, he did not compete in any races during these years.\n\n5. **Determine Truth Value of Claim**: Since there are zero mentions of Jackie Oliver competing in the specified time frame, the claim that he competed in 13 races is false according to the data provided.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was examined for entries from 1967 to 1977.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Jackie Oliver's career spanned 15 years\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table, we need to analyze the information available:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information**: The claim refers to Jackie Oliver, a racing driver. We must first identify any entries in the table that are associated with him.\n\n2. **Examine Each Entry**: \n   - Row 4: Year 1969, Entrant is \"owen racing organisation\", which does not mention Jackie Oliver.\n   - Row 5 & 6: Same as above, entrant remains \"owen racing organisation\".\n   - Row 7: Year 1970, Entrant is still \"owen racing organisation\", but it changes to \"yardley team brm\" in the same year (Row 8). This is relevant because Jackie Oliver was part of both Owen Racing Organisation and Yardley Team BRM during this time.\n   - Rows 9 & 10: Year 1971, Entrant is \"bruce mclaren motor racing\", with no mention of Jackie Oliver.\n   - Row 11: Year 1972, Entrant is \"marlboro brm\", again without mentioning Jackie Oliver.\n   - Rows 12 & 13: Years 1973 and 1977, Entrants are \"uop shadow racing team\" and \"shadow racing team\" respectively, with no mention of Jackie Oliver.\n\n3. **Determine Career Span**:\n   - From the table, Jackie Oliver is associated with BRM in 1969 (owen racing organisation) and 1970 (yardley team brm).\n   - No further entries beyond 1970 are directly linked to Jackie Oliver.\n   - Therefore, based on this data alone, his career span according to the table is from 1969 to 1970.\n\n4. **Calculate Career Span**: \n   - The years identified are 1969 and 1970.\n   - This spans only 2 years, not 15.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the data in the table, Jackie Oliver's career span as per this dataset is 2 years (1969-1970).\n   - Therefore, the claim that his career spanned 15 years is FALSE according to the information provided in the table.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**: The relevant cells for determining Jackie Oliver\u2019s involvement are:\n   - Row 4: Year 1969, Entrant \"owen racing organisation\"\n   - Row 7 & 8: Year 1970, Entrants \"owen racing organisation\" and \"yardley team brm\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify entries associated with Jackie Oliver.
