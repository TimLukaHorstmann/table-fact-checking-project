We'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: Look through each row of data to find entries with a \"gb\" value of 5.\n\n2. **Extract Win Percentages**: For those rows, extract the win percentage values.\n\n3. **Calculate Average**: Compute the average of these win percentages.\n\n4. **Compare with Claimed Value**: Check if this calculated average is equal to 535 as claimed.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**:\n   - Go through each row and check for \"gb\" = 5.\n   - From the data, we find:\n     - Row 30: gb = -, but it's not relevant since gb is not 5.\n     - Row 9: gb = 2\u00bd (not 5).\n     - Row 20: gb = 17 (not 5).\n     - Row 33: \"gb\" = 5.\n\n   Only **Row 33** has a \"gb\" of 5.\n\n2. **Extract Win Percentages**:\n   - From Row 33, the win percentage is 535.\n\n3. **Calculate Average**:\n   - Since there's only one row with gb = 5, the average win percentage is simply the win percentage from that row: 535.\n\n4. **Compare with Claimed Value**:\n   - The calculated average win percentage (535) matches the claimed value of 535.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim \"the average win percentage of a season with a gb of 5 be 535\" is true based on the available data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified rows with 'gb' = 5, extracted win percentages from these rows, calculated the average (which was just one value), and found it matches the claimed value.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 33,\n      \"column_name\": \"win percentage\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
