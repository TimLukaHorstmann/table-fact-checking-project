    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to verify two main points from the table:\n\n1. Identify episodes that have 5.7 million US viewers.\n2. Confirm if there are exactly four such episodes.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Episodes with 5.7 Million Viewers:**\n   - Look at each row and check the \"us viewers (million)\" column for a value of 5.7.\n   \n2. **List Episodes Matching the Viewer Count:**\n   - Row 1: Title is \"those lazy - hazy - crazy days\" with 5.7 million viewers.\n   - Row 7: Title is \"they shoot gilmores, don't they?\" with 5.7 million viewers.\n   - Row 8: Title is \"let the games begin\" with 5.7 million viewers.\n   - Row 16: Title is \"the big one\" with 5.7 million viewers.\n\n3. **Count the Episodes:**\n   - There are exactly four episodes with 5.7 million viewers.\n\n4. **Verify the Titles Match the Claim:**\n   - The titles mentioned in the claim (\"those lazy - hazy - crazy day\", \"they shoot gilmores, don't they?\", \"let the game begin\", and \"the big one\") match the identified episodes from the table.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that there are four episodes tied for the most viewers at 5.7 million, and it lists the correct titles. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows where 'us viewers (million)' equals 5.7.\",\n    \"List those rows: Row 1 ('those lazy - hazy - crazy days'), Row 7 ('they shoot gilmores, don't they?'), Row 8 ('let the games begin'), and Row 16 ('the big one').\",\n    \"Count these episodes to confirm there are four with 5.7 million viewers.\",\n    \"Verify that the titles in the claim match those identified from the table.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (million)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
