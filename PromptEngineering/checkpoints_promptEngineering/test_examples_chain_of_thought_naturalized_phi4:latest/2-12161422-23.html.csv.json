    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Kevin Murray be the only player who have a 3 year break in between\" is true or false, we need to examine the career spans of all players listed in the table and identify any other players with similar breaks.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Kevin Murray's Career Span:**\n   - From Row 10, Kevin Murray played from 1955 to 1964 and then again from 1967 to 1974.\n   - The break between these periods is from the end of 1964 to the start of 1967, which is a 2-year gap (1965-1966).\n\n2. **Check Other Players for Similar Breaks:**\n   - We need to look at each player's career span to see if there are any other players with breaks of 3 years or more.\n\n3. **Examine Each Player's Career Span:**\n   - **Row 1 (Michael Tuck):** 1972-1991, no break.\n   - **Row 2 (Kevin Bartlett):** 1965-1983, no break.\n   - **Row 3 (Robert Harvey):** 1988-2008, no break.\n   - **Row 4 (Dustin Fletcher):** 1993-present, no break.\n   - **Row 5 (Simon Madden):** 1974-1992, no break.\n   - **Row 6 (Craig Bradley):** 1986-2002, no break.\n   - **Row 7 (Brad Johnson):** 1994-2010, no break.\n   - **Row 8 (Brent Harvey):** 1996-present, no break.\n   - **Row 9 (Andrew McLeod):** 1995-2010, no break.\n   - **Row 10 (Kevin Murray):** 1955-1964, 1967-1974 (2-year break).\n   - **Row 11 (Adam Goodes):** 1999-present, no break.\n   - **Row 12 (Ian Nankervis):** 1967-1983, no break.\n   - **Row 13 (Simon Black):** 1998-present, no break.\n   - **Row 14 (Tony Shaw):** 1977-1994, no break.\n   - **Row 15 (David Neitz):** 1993-2008, no break.\n   - **Row 16 (Matthew Pavlich):** 2001-present, no break.\n   - **Row 17 (Glen Jakovich):** 1991-2004, no break.\n   - **Row 18 (Kane Cornes):** 1997-present, no break.\n   - **Row 19 (Roger Merrett):** 1988-1996, no break.\n   - **Row 20 (Bert Hurrey):** 1908-1913, no break.\n   - **Row 21 (Gary Ablett):** 2011-present, no break.\n   - **Row 22 (Jonathan Giles):** 2012-present, no break.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Kevin Murray has a 2-year gap in his career, not 3 years.\n   - No other player has a break of 3 years or more.\n\nThe claim is therefore false because Kevin Murray does not have a 3-year break, and no other player has such a break either.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Kevin Murray's career span includes a 2-year gap (1965-1966).
