    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the opponent for April 14 be the New Jersey Devils\" is true, let's analyze the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the Column for Date:** We need to find the column that contains dates to locate the entry for April 14.\n   - From the table structure, we know there is a \"date\" column.\n\n2. **Locate the Row with Date April 14:**\n   - Scan through each row and check the value in the \"date\" column.\n   - Row 1 has date: April 8\n   - Row 2 has date: April 10\n   - Row 3 has date: April 12\n   - **Row 4 has date: April 14**\n   - Row 5 has date: April 17\n\n3. **Identify the Opponent for the Located Date (April 14):**\n   - In Row 4, where the date is April 14, check the value in the \"opponent\" column.\n   - The opponent listed is \"New Jersey Devils.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion:** \n   - Since the opponent for the game on April 14 is indeed the New Jersey Devils, the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's format this reasoning into a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the column for dates and locate the row with date April 14.\",\n    \"Check the value in the 'opponent' column for that row.\",\n    \"The opponent on April 14 is listed as New Jersey Devils, confirming the claim.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
