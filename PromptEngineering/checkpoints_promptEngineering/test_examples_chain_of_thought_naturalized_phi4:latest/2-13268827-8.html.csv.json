In logic, if the premise (condition 1) of an \"if-then\" statement is false, the entire statement is considered true regardless of the truth value of the conclusion.\n   - Since condition 1 is false, the implication holds true by default.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is logically TRUE because it is based on a conditional statement with a false premise.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim involves a conditional statement about performance at the US Open in 2011 and 2002. According to the table, the player reached only 1r in 2011, making the premise of the condition false. In logic, a conditional with a false premise is always true.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2009\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2010\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2011\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2012\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
