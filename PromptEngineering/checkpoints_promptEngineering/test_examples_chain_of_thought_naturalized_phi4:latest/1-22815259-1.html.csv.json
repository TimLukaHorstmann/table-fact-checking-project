This implies a game against Arizona must have been played and won prior to this date.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Row**: We need to find if there is any entry in the table for a game against Arizona before September 20.\n   - According to the table, Row 1 contains the details of a game on September 20 against Arizona with the result \"win\" and a record of \"1 - 0\".\n\n3. **Checking for Previous Games**: \n   - We need to verify if there is any record of a previous game (before September 20) against Arizona.\n   - The table lists games in chronological order, starting from Row 1 to Row 9.\n\n4. **Examining Rows Before September 20**:\n   - Look at all rows before Row 1 (September 20). There are no such rows because Row 1 is the first entry.\n   - This means there are no previous entries for games played before September 20.\n\n5. **Conclusion Based on Table Data**:\n   - Since there are no entries before September 20 and the game against Arizona is recorded as occurring on that date, it is not possible for the record to be \"1 - 0\" before this date.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false because the first and only entry of a game against Arizona (with a win) happens on September 20.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis above, we conclude that the claim is FALSE.
