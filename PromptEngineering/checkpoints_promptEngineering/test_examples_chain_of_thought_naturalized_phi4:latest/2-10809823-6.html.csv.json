    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the only venue on 3 may 1980 be victoria park\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table for all entries corresponding to the date 3 May 1980 and check their venues.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify relevant rows**: All rows in the provided table are marked with the date \"3 may 1980\". Hence, every row is relevant for this analysis.\n   \n2. **Extract venue information**:\n   - Row 1: Venue is \"mcg\".\n   - Row 2: Venue is \"victoria park\".\n   - Row 3: Venue is \"princes park\".\n   - Row 4: Venue is \"junction oval\".\n   - Row 5: Venue is \"arden street oval\".\n   - Row 6: Venue is \"vfl park\".\n\n3. **Analyze the venues**:\n   - We have identified six different venues for games played on 3 May 1980.\n   - Only one of these venues is \"victoria park\", specifically in Row 2.\n\n4. **Evaluate the claim**: The claim states that \"the only venue on 3 may 1980 be victoria park\". However, our analysis shows there are multiple venues (mcg, victoria park, princes park, junction oval, arden street oval, vfl park) used on this date, not just victoria park.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The claim is false because there are other venues besides \"victoria park\" for games played on 3 May 1980.\n\n### Final JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"All rows have the same date '3 may 1980'.
