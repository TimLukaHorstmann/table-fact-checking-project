    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"only 1 race take place on the circuit des nation race track\" is true or false, we need to analyze the provided table data.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The statement asserts that only one race occurred at the Circuit des Nations race track. We need to verify how many races are listed in the table for this specific track.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**: Examine each row of the table to see if it lists \"Circuit des Nations\" as the race track. \n\n3. **Count the Races**:\n   - **Row 1**: Race Track = Circuit des Nations\n     - This is a valid instance.\n   - **Row 2**: Race Track = Circuit des Nations\n     - Another valid instance.\n   - **Row 3**: Race Track = Circuit des Nations\n     - Yet another valid instance.\n   - **Row 4**: Race Track = Circuit des Nations\n     - A fourth valid instance.\n   - **Row 5**: Race Track = Circuit des Nations\n     - Fifth and final valid instance.\n\n4. **Conclusion from the Data**:\n   - There are five instances where \"Circuit des Nations\" is listed as the race track across different races in the table, not just one.\n\n5. **Assess the Claim Against the Evidence**: \n   - The claim states there was only one race at the Circuit des Nations.\n   - However, we found that there were five races listed for this track according to the table.\n\n6. **Final Decision**:\n   - Based on the analysis of the data, the claim is FALSE as more than one race took place on the \"Circuit des Nations\" race track.\n\n7. **Identify Relevant Cells**: The relevant cells are those in which the race track is \"Circuit des Nations,\" found in all rows (1 through 5).\n\n### Final Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists five instances where 'Circuit des Nations' is mentioned as the race track. This contradicts the claim that only one race took place at this location.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"race track\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"race track\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"race track\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"race track\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"race track\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
