This does not match our aircraft type \"F27-200\".\n   - **Row 2:** Aircraft is \"Ju-52\". This also does not match.\n   - **Row 3:** Aircraft is \"F27-200\".

This matches what we need for the claim.\n\n4. **Verify Fatalities:**\n   - Check the fatalities reported for Row 3 where F27-200 is mentioned.\n   - The recorded fatalities are \"3/3\", which exactly matches the claim that states there were 3 fatalities out of 3 people on board.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the examination of the table, the aircraft F27-200 has a tail number CR-AIB and had 3/3 fatalities as stated in Row 3.\n   - Thus, the claim is consistent with the information provided in the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that an aircraft of type 'F27-200' has a tail number 'CR-AIB' and had 3/3 fatalities.

There is no numerical value provided (0/108).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states that the Ju-52 aircraft have a location of \"off maputo\" and 0/108 fatalities.\n   - From our analysis, the Ju-52's actual location is \"lagoa p\u00e1ti\", not \"off maputo\".\n   - Additionally, the fatalities for the Ju-52 are listed as \"unknown\", contradicting the claim of 0/108.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - Row 2, Column: location (value: lagoa p\u00e1ti)\n   - Row 2, Column: fatalities (value: unknown)\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that the Ju-52 aircraft have a location of 'off maputo' and 0/108 fatalities.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the aircraft with tail number C9-BAD having an unknown number of fatalities is true or false, we need to examine the table systematically.\n\n1. **Identify the Row with Tail Number C9-BAD:**\n   - We scan through each row in the table for the specific tail number \"C9-BAD\".\n   - In Row 5, we find that the aircraft has the tail number \"C9-BAD\".\n\n2. **Check the Fatalities for the Identified Row:**\n   - Once we have identified Row 5 as containing the aircraft with the tail number C9-BAD, we need to examine the fatalities column in this row.\n   - In Row 5, the fatalities are listed as \"0 / 108\". This indicates that there were 0 fatalities among passengers and crew.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the aircraft with tail number C9-BAD has an unknown number of fatalities.\n   - However, from our examination, we have determined that the number of fatalities is known to be \"0 / 108\".\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the number of fatalities for the aircraft with tail number C9-BAD is explicitly given and not unknown, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cell in the table is Row 5 under the \"fatalities\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row with the tail number 'C9-BAD'.\",\n    \"Row 5 contains the aircraft with the tail number 'C9-BAD'.\",\n    \"Check the fatalities for Row 5, which are listed as '0 / 108'.\",\n    \"The claim states that the number of fatalities is unknown.\",\n    \"Since '0 / 108' indicates a known number of fatalities, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"tail_number\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"fatalities\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
