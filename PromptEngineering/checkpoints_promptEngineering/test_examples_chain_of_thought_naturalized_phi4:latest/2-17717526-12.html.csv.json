The relevant statistics are:\n\n- **Grand Slam Win-Loss**:\n  - **2009**: 6 - 2\n  - **2010**: 4 - 3\n  - **2011**: 5 - 3\n  - **2012**: 0 - 4\n\nFrom these values, Poloma won:\n\n- **2009**: 6 Grand Slam matches\n- **2010**: 4 Grand Slam matches\n- **2011**: 5 Grand Slam matches\n- **2012**: 0 Grand Slam matches\n\nIn 2009 and 2011, the number of wins was close, but 2009 had more with 6 wins compared to 5 in 2011. Therefore, 2011 is not the year with the most Grand Slam match wins.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **Part 1**: The claim that \"2009 be the year that Poloma have the most total match win\" is TRUE.\n- **Part 2**: The claim that \"2011 be the year Poloma have the most grand slam match win\" is FALSE, as 2009 had more Grand Slam wins.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nFor clarity, here are the relevant cells for each part:\n\n- **Total Match Wins**:\n  - Row 26, Column \"overall win - loss\"\n    - 2009: 48\n    - 2010: 32\n    - 2011: 32\n    - 2012: 20\n\n- **Grand Slam Match Wins**:\n  - Row 22, Column \"win - loss\" (for Grand Slams)\n    - 2009: 6\n    - 2010: 4\n    - 2011: 5\n    - 2012: 0\n\n### Final JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim, first checked total match wins using 'overall win - loss' row to confirm 2009 had the most.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Poloma's first Grand Slam tournament match win**:\n   - We need to examine each row related to the four Grand Slam tournaments (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open) from 2006 to 2012.\n   - The symbols used are 'a' for not participating or automatic qualification, 'lq' for losing in qualifying rounds, and round numbers (e.g., '1r', '2r') indicating the player's progress in the tournament.\n   - We need to identify the first occurrence of a round number, which indicates her first match win at a Grand Slam.\n\n2. **Identify Poloma's second Premier Mandatory match win**:\n   - The Premier Mandatory tournaments are mentioned explicitly as \"premier mandatory\" (rows 16 and 20-22).\n   - We need to check the progression in these tournaments from 2006 to 2012, looking for her first two round numbers (indicating wins).\n\n3. **Compare the timeline of these achievements**:\n   - Once we have identified both events, compare their years to see if the second Premier Mandatory win occurs after her first Grand Slam tournament match win.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **First Grand Slam Tournament Match Win**:\n   - Australian Open: 2009 ('2r' in Row 3), indicating a win.\n   - French Open: 2008 ('3r'), 2010 ('4r'), 2011 ('4r').\n   - Wimbledon: 2008 ('3r'), 2009 ('3r').\n   - US Open: 2007 ('2r'), 2008 ('4r'), 2009 ('3r').\n\n   The first Grand Slam match win is in the 2007 US Open ('2r').\n\n2. **Second Premier Mandatory Match Win**:\n   - Toronto (2006): 'a', no data until 2011.\n   - Cincinnati (2006-2010): 'a', starts participating in 2011 with '1r'.\n   - Tokyo (2006-2012): 'a' mostly, '1r' in 2010.\n\n   The first Premier Mandatory win is in Toronto 2011 ('1r'), and the second is also in Toronto 2011 ('3r') or Cincinnati 2011 ('1r'). Both occur after 2007.\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n   - First Grand Slam match win: 2007 US Open.\n   - Second Premier Mandatory match win: 2011 (either Toronto or Cincinnati).\n\nSince her second Premier Mandatory win in 2011 occurs after her first Grand Slam match win in 2007, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify Poloma's first Grand Slam tournament match win by checking each Grand Slam row for the first occurrence of a round number.
