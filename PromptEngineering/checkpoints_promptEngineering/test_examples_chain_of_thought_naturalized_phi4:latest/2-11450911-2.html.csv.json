    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Keiko Tamai lost only 1 time after winning her first match\" is true or false, we need to analyze the sequence of wins and losses from Keiko Tamai's record starting after her first win.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the First Win:**\n   - The table shows that Row 28 corresponds to her first fight with a result of \"win,\" making it her debut victory. Her record after this match was \"1 - 0.\"\n\n2. **Examine Subsequent Matches for Losses:**\n   - We need to analyze the fights following this first win (Rows 29 and onward) to see how many times she lost.\n\n3. **Review of Fights After First Win:**\n   - Row 29: Loss against Mika Harigae.\n   - Row 30: Loss against Yuuki Kondo.\n   - Row 31: Loss against Yuiya Yuiga.\n   - Row 32: Win against Natsuko Kikukawa.\n   - Row 33: Loss against Akino Akino.\n   - Row 34: Loss against Kaoru Ito.\n   - Row 35: Win against Yuiga Yuiga.\n   - Row 36: Win against Kazue Terui.\n   - Row 37: Loss against Etsuko Kato.\n   - Row 38: Loss against Hikaru Shinohara.\n   - Row 39: Win against Megumi Fujii.\n   - Row 40: Loss against Hitomi Akano.\n   - Row 41: Win against Kumiko Maekawa.\n   - Row 42: Win against Yumiko Sugimoto.\n   - Row 43: Win against Hitomi Akano.\n   - Row 44: Loss against Natsuko Kikukawa.\n   - Row 45: Loss against Megumi Fujii.\n   - Row 46: Loss against Roxanne Modafferi.\n   - Row 47: Win against Hikaru Shinohara.\n   - Row 48: Win against Lee Hee-Jin.\n   - Row 49: Loss against Hitomi Akano.\n   - Row 50: Win against Natsuko Kikukawa.\n   - Row 51: Loss against Marloes Coenen.\n   - Row 52: Loss against Michiko Takeda.\n   - Row 53: Win against Jan Finney.\n   - Row 54: Win against Mamiko.\n   - Row 55: Loss against Shayna Baszler.\n\n4. **Count the Number of Losses After First Win:**\n   - From Rows 29 to 55, Keiko Tamai lost a total of 13 times (against Mika Harigae, Yuuki Kondo, Yuiya Yuiga, Akino Akino, Kaoru Ito, Etsuko Kato, Hikaru Shinohara, Hitomi Akano, Natsuko Kikukawa, Megumi Fujii, Roxanne Modafferi, Michiko Takeda, and Shayna Baszler).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that she lost only once after her first win. However, as analyzed, she actually lost 13 times following her initial victory.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The first win for Keiko Tamai was in Row 28.
