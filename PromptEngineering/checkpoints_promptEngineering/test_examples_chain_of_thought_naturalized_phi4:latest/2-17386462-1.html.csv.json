This part of the claim is true.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Most Draws by Teams\n- From Row 4, Gateshead's data shows:\n  - Drawn: 14\n\n- From Row 8, Southport's data shows:\n  - Drawn: 14\n\nBoth Gateshead and Southport have drawn 14 games each. This part of the claim is true.\n\n### Step 3: Verify Bangor City's Goals For\n- From Row 1, Bangor City's data shows:\n  - Goals for: 108\n\nBangor City scored 108 goals in total. This part of the claim is true.\n\n### Conclusion\nAll parts of the claim are verified as true based on the table data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Netherfield's losses were checked against other teams, confirming they have the highest at 28. 2. Gateshead and Southport both have 14 draws, tying for the most. 3.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze the data provided in the table regarding the number of games lost by each team. Specifically, we are looking for the highest number of games lost and which team it corresponds to.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - The column of interest is \"lost\" as it contains information about how many games each team has lost.\n\n2. **Extract Data from 'Lost' Column:**\n   - From the table, we extract the number of losses for each row (team):\n     - Row 1 (Bangor City): 7\n     - Row 2 (Mossley): 7\n     - Row 3 (Witton Albion): 10\n     - Row 4 (Gateshead): 9\n     - Row 5 (King's Lynn): 11\n     - Row 6 (Grantham): 11\n     - Row 7 (Burton Albion): 14\n     - Row 8 (Southport): 12\n     - Row 9 (Marine): 13\n     - Row 10 (Macclesfield Town): 16\n     - Row 11 (Workington): 17\n     - Row 12 (Worksop Town): 14\n     - Row 13 (South Liverpool): 16\n     - Row 14 (Goole Town): 16\n     - Row 15 (Oswestry Town): 17\n     - Row 16 (Buxton): 17\n     - Row 17 (Lancaster City): 17\n     - Row 18 (Gainsborough Trinity): 19\n     - Row 19 (Tamworth): 23\n     - Row 20 (Morecambe): 22\n     - Row 21 (Matlock Town): 23\n     - Row 22 (Netherfield): 28\n\n3. **Determine the Maximum Number of Games Lost:**\n   - The maximum number of games lost by any team in the table is 28, which corresponds to Netherfield.\n\n4. **Identify Teams with Maximum Losses:**\n   - Two teams have the highest number of losses at 23 games: Tamworth and Matlock Town.\n   - However, Netherfield has more than this number with 28 losses.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"the highest number of game lost be 23 by team matlock town.\"\n   - While it is true that Matlock Town lost 23 games, the maximum number of games lost in the table is actually 28 by Netherfield.\n   - Therefore, the statement about the highest number of games lost being 23 is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the 'lost' column to find out the number of losses for each team. Found that Netherfield has the maximum losses (28), making the claim incorrect as it mentions Matlock Town with 23 losses being the highest.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
