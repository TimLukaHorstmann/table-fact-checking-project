From the table:\n     - Row 5 corresponds to \"hand: four aces\".\n\n2. **Check Payouts for 1 Credit**:\n   - In Row 5, under the column \"1 credit\", the payout is listed as 160.\n\n3. **Check Payouts for 5 Credits**:\n   - In Row 5, under the column \"5 credits\", the payout is listed as 800.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - The claim states: \"four ace win 800 credit at 5 credit but only 160 credit at 1 credit\".\n   - From our examination of Row 5:\n     - At 1 credit, the payout is indeed 160.\n     - At 5 credits, the payout is indeed 800.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim accurately reflects the payouts for a \"four aces\" hand at both 1 and 5 credits as per the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that a 'four aces' hand wins 800 credit at 5 credits and 160 credit at 1 credit.
