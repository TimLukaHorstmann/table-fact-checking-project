Therefore, no entry in the table matches the claim's requirement for `result`.\n\n   - **Verification of Other Details** (hypothetical if there were a match):\n     - Date: The claim specifies \"8 october 2010\".\n     - Score: The claim specifies \"3 - 1\".\n     - Venue: The claim specifies \"pusk\u00e1s stadium, budapest\".\n\n   - Since no row has a result of \"1 - 1\", the other conditions (date, score, and venue) are irrelevant because there is no matching row to begin with.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is FALSE because there is no entry in the table where the `result` is \"1 - 1\". Hence, it cannot satisfy any of the other specified conditions (date, score, or venue).\n\n5. **Relevant Rows**:\n   - Only Row 7 is relevant for checking the result condition, but it does not match \"1 - 1\".\n\nThe final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim specifies a result of '1 - 1'.
