    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the game on November 20 in Dallas is true or false, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - We need to find the row corresponding to \"game: 11\" with the date \"November 20,\" as this matches the details provided in the claim.\n\n2. **Extract Details from the Table for Game 11:**\n   - From Row 11, we have:\n     - Date: November 20\n     - Team: Dallas\n     - Score: L 99 - 105 (OT)\n     - High Points: Chris Bosh (31)\n     - High Rebounds: Chris Bosh, Jamario Moon (12)\n     - High Assists: Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n (6)\n     - Location Attendance: American Airlines Center 20272\n     - Record: 5 - 6\n\n3. **Compare the Extracted Details with the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the result of the game on November 20 in Dallas was \"W 110 - 101 (OT).\"\n   - According to Row 11, the actual score was \"L 99 - 105 (OT),\" indicating a loss for the team playing against Dallas.\n   - The claim's score and outcome do not match the information from the table.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is false because the actual result of the game on November 20 in Dallas was a loss with a score of 99-105, not a win with a score of 110-101 as claimed.\n\nNow, let's format this reasoning into the required JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified Row 11 for the game on November 20 in Dallas.
