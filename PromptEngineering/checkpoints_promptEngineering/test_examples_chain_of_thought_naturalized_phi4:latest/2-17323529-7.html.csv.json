    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about game 40 having a high assist of Eric Gordon (6) is true or false, we need to examine the relevant row for game 40 in the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Row**: Locate the data for \"game: 40\" in the table.\n   - From the table, game 40 corresponds to Row 9.\n\n2. **Examine the Relevant Column**:\n   - We are interested in the \"high assists\" column because the claim is about Eric Gordon having a high assist count of 6.\n\n3. **Check the High Assists for Game 40**:\n   - In Row 9, under the \"high assists\" column, it states: \"mardy collins (8)\".\n   - This indicates that Mardy Collins had the highest number of assists in game 40 with a total of 8.\n\n4. **Verify Eric Gordon's Assist Contribution**:\n   - The entry does not list Eric Gordon as having any high assists for this game, nor does it mention him contributing 6 assists specifically.\n   - The absence of Eric Gordon from the \"high assists\" column implies that he did not have a significant assist contribution compared to Mardy Collins.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since Mardy Collins had 8 assists and Eric Gordon is not mentioned as having 6 assists in game 40, the claim that Eric Gordon had a high assist of 6 is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Eric Gordon had a high assist of 6 in game 40. By examining Row 9 for game 40, we find that Mardy Collins had the highest assists with 8. Eric Gordon is not listed as having contributed to the high assists in this game, thus the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
