We will count the number of games she played in these matches.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Matches Played on Hard Surfaces:**\n   - Row 1: Surface is \"hard (i)\".\n   - Row 2: Surface is \"hard (i)\".\n   - Row 4: Surface is \"hard\".\n\n2. **Count Games in Each Match:**\n   - **Row 1:** \n     - Opponent: Matea Mezak\n     - Score: 6-4, 4-6, 4-6\n     - Total games played by Galina Voskoboeva = (4 + 6) + (6 + 4) + (6 + 6) = 10 + 10 + 12 = 32 games.\n   - **Row 2:**\n     - Opponent: Oleksandra Kravets\n     - Score: 6-4, 6-2\n     - Total games played by Galina Voskoboeva = (4 + 6) + (2 + 6) = 10 + 8 = 18 games.\n   - **Row 4:**\n     - Opponent: Lilia Osterloh\n     - Score: 7-6, 6-4\n     - Total games played by Galina Voskoboeva = (6 + 7) + (4 + 6) = 13 + 10 = 23 games.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Games Played on Hard Surfaces:**\n   - Total from Row 1: 32 games\n   - Total from Row 2: 18 games\n   - Total from Row 4: 23 games\n\n   Adding these up gives us a total of 32 + 18 + 23 = 73 games played by Galina Voskoboeva on hard courts.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that Galina Voskoboeva played a total of 3 games on a hard tennis court, but our calculation shows she played 73 games.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Galina Voskoboeva's win rate on clay versus hard courts is true or false, let's analyze the provided table step-by-step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Matches Played by Galina Voskoboeva:**\n   - The table lists 5 matches with outcomes and details.\n\n2. **Determine Surface Type for Each Match:**\n   - Row 1: Hard (i)\n   - Row 2: Hard (i)\n   - Row 3: Clay\n   - Row 4: Hard\n   - Row 5: Clay\n\n3. **Identify Outcomes on Each Surface:**\n   - **Hard Court Matches:**\n     - Row 1: Runner-up\n     - Row 2: Winner\n     - Row 4: Runner-up\n   - **Clay Court Matches:**\n     - Row 3: Runner-up\n     - Row 5: Winner\n\n4. **Calculate Win Rate on Each Surface:**\n   - **Hard Court:**\n     - Total matches: 3 (Rows 1, 2, 4)\n     - Wins: 1 (Row 2)\n     - Win rate = 1 win / 3 total matches = 1/3 or approximately 33.33%\n   \n   - **Clay Court:**\n     - Total matches: 2 (Rows 3, 5)\n     - Wins: 1 (Row 5)\n     - Win rate = 1 win / 2 total matches = 1/2 or 50%\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Galina Voskoboeva has an equal win rate on both clay and hard courts.\n   - From the calculations:\n     - Hard court win rate is approximately 33.33%\n     - Clay court win rate is 50%\n   - Therefore, the win rates are not equal.\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim about Winning:**\n   - The claim also states she never wins.\n   - However, from the table, she has won matches (Rows 2 and 5).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim that Galina Voskoboeva has an equal win rate on both clay and hard courts is false.
