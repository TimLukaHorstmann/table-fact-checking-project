    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the home team score 17.5 (107) on sunday, january 30\" is TRUE or FALSE, let's analyze the relevant parts of the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the Date**: The claim specifies a game that occurred on \"sunday, january 30\". We need to check which row(s) in the table correspond to this date.\n\n2. **Locate Rows with Date 'Sunday, January 30'**:\n   - Row 1: Has the date \"sunday , 30 january\".\n   - Row 2: Also has the date \"sunday , 30 january\".\n\n3. **Check Home Team Score for These Dates**:\n   - For Row 1: \n     - Home team score is listed as 17.5 (107).\n     - This matches the home team score mentioned in the claim.\n   - For Row 2:\n     - Home team score is listed as 10.14 (74).\n     - This does not match the home team score mentioned in the claim.\n\n4. **Confirm Ground and Teams**:\n   - In Row 1, the home team is \"adelaide\", which aligns with the context of the claim since there's no specific mention of a different team.\n   - The details about the away team or ground are not necessary for verifying the score aspect of the claim.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since Row 1 matches all criteria specified in the claim (date, home team score), we can conclude that the claim is TRUE based on this row's data.\n\nNow, let's output the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows with date 'sunday , 30 january'.\",\n    \"Row 1 and Row 2 match this date.\",\n    \"Check home team score for these dates.\",\n    \"Row 1 has a home team score of 17.5 (107), matching the claim.\",\n    \"Row 2 does not match the home team score from the claim.\",\n    \"Since Row 1 satisfies all conditions of the claim, it is TRUE.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
