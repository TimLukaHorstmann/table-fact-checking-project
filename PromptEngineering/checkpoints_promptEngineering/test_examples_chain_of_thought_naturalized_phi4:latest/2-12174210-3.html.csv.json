    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to check the details about Kaharoa School from the provided table. The claim states two specific points: \n1. Kaharoa School is coeducational (coed).\n2. It has a decile rating of 9.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate Kaharoa School in the Table**:\n   - We need to find the row corresponding to \"Kaharoa School\". According to the table, it is Row 47.\n\n2. **Verify if Kaharoa School is Coeducational (Coed)**:\n   - From Row 47, check the \"gender\" column. It lists \"coed\", which means it serves both boys and girls.\n   \n3. **Check the Decile Rating for Kaharoa School**:\n   - Still in Row 47, look at the \"decile\" column to find its rating. The decile is listed as 3.\n\n4. **Compare with Claim Details**:\n   - The claim states that Kaharoa School has a decile of 9.\n   - Our verification shows it actually has a decile of 3.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - While the school is indeed coeducational (satisfying part of the claim), its decile rating does not match the claimed value.
