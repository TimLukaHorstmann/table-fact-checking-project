    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Cole's field goal performance is true, we need to verify the provided statistics from the table against the claim.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row**: \n   - The player \"cole\" corresponds to Row 9 in the table.\n\n2. **Check Field Goals**:\n   - According to the table, Cole's field goals are listed as \"18 - 50\".\n   - This means Cole made 18 successful field goals out of 50 attempts.\n\n3. **Check Percentage**:\n   - The percentage for field goals is given as \"360\".\n   - To verify this, calculate the actual percentage: \\((\\frac{18}{50}) \\times 100 = 36\\%\\).\n   - The table states \"360\", which seems to be a typographical error since it should represent 36%.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states \"cole have 18 out of 50 field goal for a 360 average\".\n   - The numbers \"18 out of 50\" match exactly with the table.\n   - The percentage \"360\" in the claim matches the typographical representation of \"36%\" in the table.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim accurately reflects the data provided in the table, despite the apparent typographical error in representing percentages as whole numbers (e.g., \"360\" instead of \"36%\").\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The player 'cole' is in Row 9.
