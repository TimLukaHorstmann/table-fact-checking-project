    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the 49ers lose 2 out of 14 games in the 1947 season\" is true or false, let's analyze the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Losses:**\n   - We need to count the number of losses ('L') recorded in the \"result\" column for each game.\n   - Row 4: Result is 'l' (loss) against New York Yankees.\n   - Row 8: Result is 'l' (loss) against Cleveland Browns.\n   - Row 10: Result is 'l' (loss) against New York Yankees again.\n   - Row 11: Result is 'l' (loss) against Cleveland Browns again.\n\n2. **Count the Losses:**\n   - From the analysis above, there are four losses recorded in the season:\n     - Week 4\n     - Week 8\n     - Week 10\n     - Week 11\n\n3. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the 49ers lost only 2 games.\n   - However, we identified 4 losses.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the number of losses (4) does not match the claim (2), the statement is false.\n\nRelevant cells from the table include all entries in the \"result\" column that indicate a loss ('l'):\n\n- Row 4: Result 'l'\n- Row 8: Result 'l'\n- Row 10: Result 'l'\n- Row 11: Result 'l'\n\nHere's the JSON output with the reasoning and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify all entries in the table where the result is a loss ('l').\",\n    \"Count the number of losses.\",\n    \"Compare the count of losses to the claim that states there are 2 losses.\",\n    \"Determine if the actual count matches the claim.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
