    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to evaluate the sequence of games against the opponents mentioned: the Atlanta Flames and the Los Angeles Kings.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Games Against Each Opponent:**\n   - Look for the row where the opponent is \"atlanta flames\".\n   - Look for rows where the opponent is \"los angeles kings\".\n\n2. **Determine Game Numbers:**\n   - Note the game number for each encounter with these opponents.\n\n3. **Compare Game Dates:**\n   - Compare the dates of the games to see which opponent was faced first.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Atlanta Flames:**\n  - Row 10 indicates a game against the Atlanta Flames on November 21 (Game 20).\n\n- **Los Angeles Kings:**\n  - Row 6 indicates a game against the Los Angeles Kings on November 12 (Game 16).\n  - Another game against the Los Angeles Kings is listed in Row 14, but it occurs later on November 29 (Game 24).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe first game against the Los Angeles Kings (November 12, Game 16) occurred before the game against the Atlanta Flames (November 21, Game 20).
