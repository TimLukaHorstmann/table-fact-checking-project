    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"99012 be the lowest reset point where the event be 56\" is true or false, we need to examine each row of the table for two specific conditions:\n\n1. The number of events should be exactly 56.\n2. If such a row exists, identify the reset points and check if any are lower than 99012.\n\nLet's go through the steps systematically:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Events Equal to 56:**\n   - We need to look at the \"events\" column in each row to find rows where the number of events is exactly 56.\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 1 (tiger woods): events = 13\n     - Row 2 (vijay singh): events = 23\n     - Row 3 (jim furyk): events = 19\n     - Row 4 (phil mickelson): events = 18\n     - Row 5 (kj choi): events = 21\n     - Row 6 (rory sabbatini): events = 19\n     - Row 7 (zach johnson): events = 19\n     - Row 8 (charles howell iii): events = 21\n     - Row 9 (brandt snedeker): events = 25\n\n   None of the rows have an \"events\" value of 56.\n\n2. **Check Reset Points:**\n   - Since no row has events equal to 56, there is no need to check the reset points for such a condition.\n   - Therefore, we cannot identify any reset point as being associated with 56 events, let alone find the lowest one.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim \"99012 be the lowest reset point where the event be 56\" implies that there is at least one row where events equal 56 and a reset point of 99012 or lower.\n   - Since no row meets the condition of having 56 events, the premise of the claim does not hold.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim is false because there are no rows with 56 events in the table. Consequently, it is impossible for any reset point to be associated with this number of events, let alone being the lowest one at 99012.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires finding a row where 'events' equals 56 and checking if there's a reset point lower than or equal to 99012.
