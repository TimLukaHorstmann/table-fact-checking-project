    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"there be 3 championship scores at Brockton, Massachusetts in 1991 - 1994\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data for championships held in Brockton, Massachusetts within those years.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Location**: The claim specifically refers to \"Brockton, Massachusetts\". We will focus on entries with this location.\n\n2. **Examine the Time Frame**: The time frame specified is from 1991 to 1994. We need to check for championship events in these years at Brockton.\n\n3. **Review Each Year**:\n   - **1991**: Check if there was a championship held in Brockton.\n     - Row 23: Venue \"pga west\", Location \"la quinta, california\". This is not Brockton, so no score here.\n   - **1992**: Check for the year.\n     - Row 22: Venue \"pga west\", Location \"la quinta, california\". Not Brockton.\n   - **1993**: Check for this year.\n     - Row 21: Venue \"pga west\", Location \"la quinta, california\". Still not Brockton.\n   - **1994**: Finally check the last year in the range.\n     - Row 20: Venue \"pga west\", Location \"la quinta, california\". Again, not Brockton.\n\n4. **Identify Any Championships at Brockton in the Given Years**:\n   - Upon reviewing all rows from 1991 to 1994, none of them are held at Brockton, Massachusetts. They are all held at \"pga west\" in La Quinta, California.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since there are no championship scores recorded for any year between 1991 and 1994 at Brockton, Massachusetts, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states there were 3 championship scores at Brockton, Massachusetts from 1991 to 1994. Reviewing each year within this range in the table shows that all championships during these years were held at 'pga west' in La Quinta, California.
