    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to check if the row in the table where live births are 43,243 corresponds to a migration of -14,873.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Live Births:**\n   - The claim states that there were 43,243 live births.\n   - We will look through each row for this specific number in the \"live births\" column.\n\n2. **Locate the Row with 43,243 Live Births:**\n   - Check Row 6: Live births = 43,243.\n   - This matches the claim's specified number of live births.\n\n3. **Check Migration Value in the Same Row:**\n   - In Row 6, we need to verify the migration value.\n   - According to the table, the migration for Row 6 is -14,873.\n\n4. **Compare with Claimed Migration:**\n   - The claim states that this row should have a migration of -14,873.\n   - This matches exactly with what is provided in the table for Row 6.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since both the live births and migration values match the claim, the statement is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 6:\n  - \"live births\": 43,243\n  - \"migration\": -14,873\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that there were 43,243 live births with a migration of -14,873.
