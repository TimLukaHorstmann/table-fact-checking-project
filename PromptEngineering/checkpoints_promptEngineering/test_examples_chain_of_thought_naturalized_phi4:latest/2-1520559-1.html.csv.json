    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Jiyai Shin earning $36517 less than Yani Tseng in their respective championship years (2012 for Shin, 2011 for Tseng) is true or false, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Winner's Share for Jiyai Shin in 2012:**\n   - From the table, locate Row 2 which corresponds to the year 2012.\n   - In this row, find the \"winner 's share\" column value for Jiyai Shin.\n   - The winner's share is $428650.\n\n2. **Identify Winner's Share for Yani Tseng in 2011:**\n   - From the table, locate Row 3 which corresponds to the year 2011.\n   - In this row, find the \"winner 's share\" column value for Yani Tseng.\n   - The winner's share is $392133.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference Between Their Winner's Shares:**\n   - Subtract Yani Tseng\u2019s winner's share from Jiyai Shin\u2019s winner's share:\n     \\[\n     428650 - 392133 = 36517\n     \\]\n\n4. **Compare Calculated Difference with Claimed Amount:**\n   - The claim states that Jiyai Shin earned $36517 less than Yani Tseng in 2011.\n   - Our calculation shows Jiyai Shin actually earned $36517 more, not less.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the calculated difference is the opposite of what the claim states (i.e., Jiyai Shin earned more), the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified winner's share for Jiyai Shin in 2012 as $428650 and for Yani Tseng in 2011 as $392133.
