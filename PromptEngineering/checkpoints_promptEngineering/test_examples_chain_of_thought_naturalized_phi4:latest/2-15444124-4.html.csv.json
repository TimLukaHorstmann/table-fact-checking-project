However, in 2003, the number of goals is also \"did not play.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that for any year where total points are \"did not play,\" there must be exactly 1 goal. In 2003, both total points and goals are marked as \"did not play,\" which contradicts the condition set by the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The year in question is 2003. All entries for this year, including goals, are marked as 'did not play.' The claim states that when total points are 'did not play,' there should always be exactly 1 goal.
