    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the given table based on specific criteria mentioned in the claim.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n\"When there be 10 appearances at UEFA and less than 4 at League Cup, the total number of appearances in the Premier League be 44.\"\n\nLet's break down the conditions specified in the claim:\n\n1. **UEFA Cup Appearances**: The player must have exactly 10 appearances.\n2. **League Cup Appearances**: The player must have fewer than 4 appearances (i.e., 0, 1, 2, or 3).\n3. **Premier League Total**: The total number of Premier League appearances should be 44.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Players with 10 UEFA Cup Appearances**:\n   - From the table, we identify players who have exactly 10 appearances in the UEFA Cup.\n     - Michael Dawson (Row 1): UEFA Cup = 10\n     - Pascal Chimbonda (Row 3): UEFA Cup = 10\n\n2. **Check League Cup Appearances for These Players**:\n   - For Michael Dawson (Row 1):\n     - League Cup = 4\n   - For Pascal Chimbonda (Row 3):\n     - League Cup = 4\n\n3. **Verify the Condition of Less than 4 League Cup Appearances**:\n   - Neither Michael Dawson nor Pascal Chimbonda have fewer than 4 appearances in the League Cup (both have exactly 4).\n\n4. **Conclusion Based on Conditions**:\n   - Since neither player meets the condition of having less than 4 appearances in the League Cup, we do not need to check their Premier League appearances for the total being 44.\n\n5. **Final Evaluation of the Claim**:\n   - There are no players who satisfy all the conditions specified in the claim (10 UEFA Cup appearances and fewer than 4 League Cup appearances). Therefore, the condition about having a total of 44 Premier League appearances is irrelevant as it never applies.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe claim is false because there are no players meeting all the specified criteria.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified players with exactly 10 UEFA Cup appearances: Michael Dawson and Pascal Chimbonda.
