Here's how we will approach this:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify relevant rows for each team:**\n   - Team 1 FC Nantes is mentioned in Row 1.\n   - Team 1 OGC Nice is mentioned in Row 3.\n\n2. **Locate the scores for the 1st round for both teams:**\n   - For FC Nantes (Row 1):\n     - The score during the 1st round is given as \"0 - 0\".\n   - For OGC Nice (Row 3):\n     - The score during the 1st round is given as \"1 - 2\".\n\n3. **Extract and compare the scores:**\n   - FC Nantes scored 0 goals in their 1st round.\n   - OGC Nice scored 1 goal in their 1st round.\n\n4. **Evaluate the claim:**\n   - The claim states that FC Nantes have a score less than OGC Nice during the 1st round.\n   - Since 0 (FC Nantes' 1st-round goals) is indeed less than 1 (OGC Nice's 1st-round goals), the claim is true.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe scores from the relevant cells confirm that FC Nantes scored fewer goals in their 1st round compared to OGC Nice, making the claim TRUE.
