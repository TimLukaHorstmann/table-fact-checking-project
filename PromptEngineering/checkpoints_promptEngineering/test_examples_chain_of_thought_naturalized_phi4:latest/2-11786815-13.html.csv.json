    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the highest attendance for a match with a score of 0 - 4 being 20066 is true, we need to analyze the provided table and focus on matches where the score was 0 - 4. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Matches with Score 0 - 4:**\n   - We need to locate any row in the table where the \"score\" column indicates a match result of 0 - 4.\n\n2. **Check Attendance for Identified Match(es):**\n   - Once we find such matches, we will check the attendance figure recorded in those rows to see if it is indeed 20066 or higher.\n\n3. **Compare and Conclude:**\n   - If there are no other scores of 0 - 4 with a higher attendance than 20066, then the claim is true.\n   - If any score of 0 - 4 has an attendance greater than 20066, the claim is false.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n- **Row 1**: The \"score\" is 0 - 4. The corresponding \"attendance\" is 20066.\n  \n- **Other Rows Check**: \n  - Row 2: Score is 0 - 3 (not relevant).\n  - Row 3: Score is 2 - 3 (not relevant).\n  - Row 4: Score is 2 - 1 (not relevant).\n  - Row 5: Score is 4 - 3 (not relevant).\n  - Row 6: Score is 3 - 2 (not relevant).\n\nFrom the analysis, only Row 1 has a score of 0 - 4. The attendance for this match is indeed 20066.\n\n**Conclusion**: Since Row 1 is the only occurrence of a 0 - 4 score and its attendance is 20066, there are no higher attendance figures to compare against.
