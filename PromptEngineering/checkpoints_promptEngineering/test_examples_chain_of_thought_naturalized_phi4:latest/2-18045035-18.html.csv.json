According to the table:\n     - Doug Hogue's long is indeed 82 yards.\n     - There is no mention of a 45-yard long pass for Doug Hogue in the table.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that \"curtis brinkley have an avg / g of 97.0\" is correct based on the table data. However, the part stating \"doug hogue have an avg / g of 21.1 with a long of 45 and 82\" is partially incorrect because Doug Hogue only has a recorded long pass of 82 yards according to the table; there is no record of a 45-yard long pass for him.\n\nTherefore, the claim as a whole is FALSE due to the incorrect information about Doug Hogue's long passes.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Curtis Brinkley has an avg / g of 97.0 which matches the table data.

Verify if those two players (Tony Fiammetta and Rob Long) average 5.5 and 2.0 yards per game respectively.\n\nLet's go through the relevant data in the table step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Identifying Players with Zero Losses\n\n- **Row 2:** Doug Hogue has 0 losses.\n- **Row 3:** Antwon Bailey has 6 losses (not zero).\n- **Row 4:** Delone Carter has 4 losses (not zero).\n- **Row 5:** Tony Fiammetta has 0 losses.\n- **Row 6:** Rob Long has 0 losses.\n- **Row 7:** Andrew Robinson has 28 losses (not zero).\n- **Row 8:** Cam Dantley has 154 losses (not zero).\n\nFrom this, we identify the players with zero losses as Doug Hogue, Tony Fiammetta, and Rob Long.\n\n### Step 2: Verifying Average Yards per Game for Tony Fiammetta and Rob Long\n\n- **Row 5:** Tony Fiammetta's average yards per game (avg / g) is 5.5.\n- **Row 6:** Rob Long's average yards per game (avg / g) is 2.0.\n\n### Step 3: Cross-checking the Claim Details\n\nThe claim states:\n- There are two players with zero losses, namely Tony Fiammetta and Rob Long.\n- Their average yards per game are 5.5 and 2.0 respectively.\n\nFrom our analysis:\n- We identified three players (Doug Hogue, Tony Fiammetta, and Rob Long) with zero losses, not just two as the claim states.\n- The averages for Tony Fiammetta and Rob Long match what is stated in the claim.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim inaccurately states that there are only two players without a loss when there are actually three (Doug Hogue, Tony Fiammetta, and Rob Long).
