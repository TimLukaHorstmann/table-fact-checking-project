    "resp": "To determine if the claim about Fortaleza's performance in 2003 is true, we need to analyze two specific aspects from the table: \n\n1. **Number of Games Lost**: We need to find out which team lost the most games.\n2. **Points Earned**: We need to check if Fortaleza earned the fewest points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n#### 1. Identify the Team with the Greatest Number of Losses:\n- From the table, we examine the \"lost\" column for each row.\n- Row 12: Atl\u00e9tico - PR lost 19 games.\n- Row 13: Guarani also lost 19 games.\n- Row 14: Crici\u00fama lost 20 games (highest).\n- Row 18: Juventude lost 20 games.\n\nThe teams with the greatest number of losses are Crici\u00fama and Juventude, each losing 20 games. Fortaleza lost 21 games.\n\n#### 2. Identify the Team with the Fewest Points:\n- From the table, we examine the \"points\" column for each row.\n- Row 24: Bahia earned 46 points (lowest).\n\nFortaleza earned 49 points, which is not the fewest; Bahia has fewer points than Fortaleza.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis above, Fortaleza did lose the greatest number of games (21), but they did not earn the fewest points. Bahia earned fewer points with 46 points compared to Fortaleza's 49 points.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because it inaccurately states that Fortaleza earned the fewest points.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Points for Fortaleza: Row 23, \"points\"\n- Lost games for Fortaleza: Row 23, \"lost\"\n- Highest lost games: Row 14 and Row 18, \"lost\" (Crici\u00fama and Juventude)\n- Fewest points: Row 24, \"points\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim, we checked which team had the most losses and the fewest points.
