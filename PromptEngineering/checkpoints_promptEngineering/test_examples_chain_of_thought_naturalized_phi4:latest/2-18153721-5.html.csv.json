    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the 3-player tie at second place:**\n   - From Row 1 to Row 5 of the table:\n     - Rows 1 and 2 have players tied for first place with a score of 139.\n     - Rows 3, 4, and 5 indicate players who are placed third (t3), suggesting they form a tie at second place. The relevant entries here are for Tony Johnstone (Zimbabwe), Christy O'Connor Jr. (Ireland), and D.A. Weibring (United States).\n\n2. **Check the scores of these players:**\n   - From Row 3, Row 4, and Row 5:\n     - Tony Johnstone's score is 68 + 72 = 140.\n     - Christy O'Connor Jr.'s score is 64 + 76 = 140.\n     - D.A. Weibring's score is 69 + 71 = 140.\n\n3. **Verify the 'to par' value for these players:**\n   - From Row 3, Row 4, and Row 5:\n     - Tony Johnstone has a to par of \"e\" (even).\n     - Christy O'Connor Jr. also has a to par of \"e\".\n     - D.A. Weibring's to par is \"e\".\n\n4. **Analyze the claim:**\n   - The claim states, \"the 3 player tie at 2nd place be even to par.\" This means all three players tied for second place should have a 'to par' value of \"e\".\n   - All three identified players (Tony Johnstone, Christy O'Connor Jr., D.A. Weibring) indeed have their 'to par' values as \"e\".\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the analysis, all relevant conditions in the claim are met.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the players tied for second place (Rows 3-5).\",\n    \"Verify their scores to confirm they are 140.\",\n    \"Check the 'to par' values of these players to ensure they are all even ('e').\",\n    \"Since all three players have a 'to par' value of 'e', the claim is validated as TRUE.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
