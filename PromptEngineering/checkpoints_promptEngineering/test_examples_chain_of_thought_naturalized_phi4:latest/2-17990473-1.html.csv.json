    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about week 4's game attendance and date is true or false, we'll analyze the table row corresponding to week 4.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row**: \n   - The claim is regarding \"week 4\" of the season.\n   - According to the table structure, each row corresponds to a specific week. Therefore, look at Row 4 for details about week 4.\n\n2. **Check the Attendance**:\n   - For week 4 (Row 4), verify the attendance number provided in the \"attendance\" column.\n   - The table states: `attendance: 74181` for this row.\n\n3. **Check the Date**:\n   - Confirm the date of the game in Row 4 from the \"date\" column.\n   - The table states: `date: october 3 , 1999`.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim is: \"week 4 game do not have an attendance of 74181 and be play on october 3 , 1999\".\n   - Break down the claim into two parts:\n     - Part 1: \"do not have an attendance of 74181\". This part is false because the table shows that the attendance was indeed 74181.\n     - Part 2: \"be play on october 3 , 1999\". This part is true as per the date provided in the table.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the first part of the claim (\"do not have an attendance of 74181\") is false, the entire disjunctive statement (using \"and\") becomes false because both conditions need to be true for the overall statement to hold.\n   - Therefore, the claim as a whole is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 4, Column: \n  - `attendance`: 74181\n  - `date`: october 3 , 1999\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim about week 4's game involves two parts: the attendance and the date. By examining row 4 for these details, it was found that the attendance is indeed 74181, making the first part of the claim false. The date matches as October 3, 1999, making the second part true. Since both conditions are required to be true for an 'and' statement, and one part is false, the entire claim is FALSE.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
