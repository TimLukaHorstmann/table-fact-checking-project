    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, let's analyze each component step-by-step:\n\n### Claim:\n\"cup noodle honda be the only team with nsr250 and have less than 8 points\"\n\n#### Steps to Evaluate:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with \"nsr250\":**\n   - We need to identify all rows where the machine is \"nsr250\".\n\n2. **Check Teams and Points for Each \"nsr250\" Row:**\n   - For each row identified in step 1, check if the team is \"cup noodle - honda\".\n   - Also, verify the points for these rows.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim Conditions:**\n   - The claim states that \"cup noodle honda be the only team with nsr250 and have less than 8 point.\"\n   - We need to ensure:\n     - No other teams besides \"cup noodle - honda\" use \"nsr250\".\n     - Any instance of \"cup noodle - honda\" using \"nsr250\" should have points less than 8.\n\n#### Analysis:\n\n- **Row 1:** \n  - Year: 1993\n  - Team: cup noodle - honda\n  - Machine: nsr250\n  - Points: 8\n\n- **Row 2:** \n  - Year: 1994\n  - Team: cup noodle - honda\n  - Machine: nsr250\n  - Points: 11\n\n- **Other Rows (3, 4, 5):** \n  - Machines are not \"nsr250\".\n\n#### Evaluation:\n\n1. **Team Check for \"nsr250\":**\n   - Only \"cup noodle - honda\" uses \"nsr250\" in rows 1 and 2.\n\n2. **Points Check for \"nsr250\":**\n   - Row 1: Points = 8 (not less than 8)\n   - Row 2: Points = 11 (not less than 8)\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - While \"cup noodle - honda\" is the only team with \"nsr250\", neither instance has points less than 8.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because, although \"cup noodle - honda\" is the only team using \"nsr250\", none of their entries have points less than 8.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified rows with machine 'nsr250'. Checked that 'cup noodle - honda' is the only team using 'nsr250'. Verified points for these instances: Row 1 has 8 points, and Row 2 has 11 points. Neither is less than 8, so the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"machine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"machine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
