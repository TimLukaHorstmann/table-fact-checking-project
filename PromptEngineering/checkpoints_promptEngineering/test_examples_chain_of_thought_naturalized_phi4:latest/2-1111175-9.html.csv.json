    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Magdalena Maleeva only played 2 tennis matches on carpet\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table for matches involving Magdalena Maleeva and identify which of those were played on a carpet surface.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Matches Involving Magdalena Maleeva:**\n   - We need to look through each row in the table to find entries where \"Magdalena Maleeva\" is listed as the opponent.\n\n2. **Check Surface Type for Each Match:**\n   - For each match involving Magdalena Maleeva, check the surface type on which the match was played.\n\n3. **Count Matches Played on Carpet:**\n   - Specifically count how many of these matches were played on a \"carpet\" surface.\n\n4. **Verify Total Number of Carpet Matches:**\n   - Ensure that the total number of matches played on carpet is exactly 2, as claimed.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Row 10:** \n  - Opponent: Conchita Mart\u00ednez\n  - Surface: Carpet (i)\n  \n- **Row 11:**\n  - Opponent: Arantxa S\u00e1nchez Vicario\n  - Surface: Carpet (i)\n\nThese rows indicate matches played by Magdalena Maleeva on a carpet surface.
