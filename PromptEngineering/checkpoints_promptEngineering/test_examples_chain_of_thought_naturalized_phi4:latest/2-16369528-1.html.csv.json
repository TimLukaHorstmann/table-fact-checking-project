    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"na only win the reader's vote in 2011\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data concerning the \"reader's vote\" category for each year.\n\n**Step-by-step Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: Focus on the \"reader's vote\" column across all rows since this is where we are checking for occurrences of \"na\".\n\n2. **Check Each Year (Row) in the Table**:\n   - **Year 1996 (Row 1)**: The \"reader's vote\" entry is \"na\".\n   - **Year 1997 (Row 2)**: The \"reader's vote\" entry is \"na\".\n   - **Year 1998 (Row 3)**: The \"reader's vote\" entry is \"na\".\n   - **Year 1999 (Row 4)**: The \"reader's vote\" entry is \"na\".\n   - **Year 2000 (Row 5)**: The \"reader's vote\" entry is \"na\".\n   - **Year 2001 (Row 6)**: The \"reader's vote\" entry is \"bleeding hearts by lindy cameron\", not \"na\".\n   - **Year 2002 (Row 7)**: The \"reader's vote\" entry is \"apartment 255 by bunty avieson\", not \"na\".\n   - **Year 2003 (Row 8)**: The \"reader's vote\" entry is \"na\".\n   - **Year 2004 (Row 9)**: The \"reader's vote\" entry is \"na\".\n   - **Year 2005 (Row 10)**: The \"reader's vote\" entry is \"na\".\n   - **Year 2006 (Row 11)**: The \"reader's vote\" entry is \"na\".\n   - **Year 2007 (Row 12)**: The \"reader's vote\" entry is \"na\".\n   - **Year 2008 (Row 13)**: The \"reader's vote\" entry is \"na\".\n   - **Year 2009 (Row 14)**: The \"reader's vote\" entry is \"na\".\n   - **Year 2010 (Row 15)**: The \"reader's vote\" entry is \"na\".\n   - **Year 2011 (Row 16)**: The \"reader's vote\" entry is \"na\".\n\n3. **Analyze the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that \"na only win the reader's vote in 2011\". However, from our analysis, we see that there are multiple years where \"na\" appears in the \"reader's vote\" column before and after 2011.\n   \n4. **Conclusion**: Since \"na\" appears as a result for other years besides 2011, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells**:\n- Rows with \"reader's vote\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]\n- Specifically, Row 6 and Row 7 are where \"na\" is not the result.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states 'na only win the reader's vote in 2011'.
