This corresponds to Row 9 in the provided table.\n\n2. **Examine Home Team Information**:\n   - In Row 9, we find the entry for `home` which is specified as \"montreal\".\n   - The claim states that the home team was Montreal on November 19, so this part of the information matches.\n\n3. **Check the Score**:\n   - The score listed in Row 9 for November 19 is \"4 - 2\".\n   - According to the claim, the score should be \"4 - 2\". This also matches with the table data.\n\nBoth components of the claim \u2014 the home team being Montreal and the score being 4-2 \u2014 are verified against the entries in Row 9. Therefore, based on this information, the claim is accurate.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- **Row 9, Column \"home\"**: Contains \"montreal\".\n- **Row 9, Column \"score\"**: Contains \"4 - 2\".\n\nGiven that both conditions of the claim are satisfied with the table's entries for November 19, we can conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The data in Row 9 shows that on November 19, the home team was Montreal and the score was 4 - 2.

Score: 1-3 (Total goals = 4).\n   - In Row 9: Date November 19, Montreal is the home team with a score of 2-4 (Visitor wins), so Total goals = 6.\n\n3. **Calculate Scores for Other Home Games**:\n   - Row 1: Ottawa's home game against Atlanta; Score: 4-6 (Total goals = 10).\n   - Row 2: Ottawa's home game against Boston; Score: 2-3 (Total goals = 5).\n   - Row 3: Boston's home game against Ottawa; Score: 2-1 (Total goals = 3).\n   - Row 4: Ottawa's home game against Toronto; Score: 1-5 (Total goals = 6).\n   - Row 5: Ottawa's home game against Washington; Score: 4-1 (Total goals = 5).\n   - Row 7: Ottawa's home game against Buffalo; Score: 2-3 (Total goals = 5).\n   - Row 8: Toronto's home game against Ottawa; Score: 0-3 (Total goals = 3).\n   - Row 10: Buffalo's home game against Ottawa; Score: 4-2 (Total goals = 6).\n   - Row 11: Ottawa's home game against Pittsburgh; Score: 6-5 (Total goals = 11).\n   - Row 12: Ottawa's home game against Philadelphia; Score: 4-3 (Total goals = 7).\n   - Row 13: New York Islanders' home game against Ottawa; Score: 2-3 (Total goals = 5).\n   - Row 14: Ottawa's home game against Nashville; Score: 6-5 (Total goals = 11).\n\n4. **Compare Scores**:\n   - Montreal\u2019s highest score when they were away was 1-3 with a total of 4 goals.\n   - The highest-scoring games in the month occurred on November 1 and November 11, both with Ottawa as the home team scoring totals of 10 and 11 respectively.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMontreal's highest-scoring game (when they were visitors) had fewer total goals than any of the highest-scoring home games during that month.
