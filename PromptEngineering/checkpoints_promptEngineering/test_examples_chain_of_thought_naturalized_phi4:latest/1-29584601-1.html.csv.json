According to Row 19, this title has a `no in series` value of 66.\n\n3. **Compare with Other Entries:**\n   - To determine if it is the lowest, compare its `no in series` value with all other entries.\n   - The table consists of rows numbered from 1 to 20, each having a unique `no in series`.\n\n4. **Check for Lower Values:**\n   - Review all `no in series` values:\n     - Row 1: 47\n     - Row 2: 48\n     - Row 3: 49\n     - Row 4: 50\n     - Row 5: 51\n     - Row 6: 52\n     - Row 7: 53\n     - Row 8: 54\n     - Row 9: 56 (Note: Row 10 is missing)\n     - Row 11: 58\n     - Row 12: 59\n     - Row 13: 60\n     - Row 14: 61\n     - Row 15: 62\n     - Row 16: 63\n     - Row 17: 64\n     - Row 18: 65\n     - Row 19 (knight in retreat): 66\n     - Row 20: 67\n\n5. **Determine the Lowest Value:**\n   - The lowest `no in series` value is 47, which corresponds to \"knight of the drones (part 1)\" from Row 1.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since 47 is lower than 66, \"knight in retreat\" does not have the lowest `no in series`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the title 'knight in retreat' from Row 19 with a 'no in series' value of 66.\",\n    \"Compare this value against all other 'no in series' values in the table.\",\n    \"The lowest 'no in series' is 47, found in Row 1 for 'knight of the drones (part 1)'.\",\n    \"'Knight in retreat' does not have the lowest 'no in series', so the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
