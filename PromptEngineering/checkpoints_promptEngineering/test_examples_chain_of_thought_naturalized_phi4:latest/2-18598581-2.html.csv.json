    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"manchester play eccles 2 times\" is true or false, let's analyze the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Matches Involving Eccles:**\n   - Row 1: The opponents are \"eccles.\"\n   - Row 2: The opponents are again \"eccles.\"\n\n   So, there are two matches listed where \"eccles\" is an opponent.\n\n2. **Identify Matches Involving Manchester:**\n   - Row 3: The opponents are \"manchester.\"\n\n   There is only one match listed where \"manchester\" is an opponent.\n\n3. **Cross-Reference Both Teams:**\n   - From the steps above, we see that there are no matches involving both \"eccles\" and \"manchester\" as opponents in any single row. \n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there are no rows where both teams are listed as playing against each other, Manchester did not play Eccles.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"manchester play eccles 2 times\" is false.\n\nRelevant cells to this analysis include:\n- Row 1 and Row 2 for matches involving \"eccles.\"\n- Row 3 for the match involving \"manchester.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify all rows where 'eccles' appears as an opponent.
