    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"8 primary school in Dacorum be not affiliate with church\" is true or false, we need to examine each row of the table for schools affiliated with a faith. The specific steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Identify Primary Schools:** We only consider rows where the `type` column is marked as `primary`.\n\n2. **Check Faith Affiliation:** For these primary schools, check if they have any value in the `faith` column other than `-`. A non-empty entry indicates a faith affiliation.\n\n3. **Count Non-Affiliated Primary Schools:** Count how many primary schools have their `faith` column marked as `-`, indicating no church affiliation.\n\n4. **Verify Against Claim:** The claim states there are 8 primary schools not affiliated with a church. We need to see if the count from step 3 matches this number.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n- **Row 1 (Belswains):** `type` is primary, `faith` is `-`. No affiliation.\n- **Row 2 (Chamberbury):** `type` is primary, `faith` is `-`. No affiliation.\n- **Row 3 (Hobbs Hill Wood):** `type` is primary, `faith` is `-`. No affiliation.\n- **Row 4 (Leverstock Green):** `type` is primary, `faith` is ce. Affiliated with church.\n- **Row 5 (Lime Walk):** `type` is primary, `faith` is `-`. No affiliation.\n- **Row 6 (Nash Mills):** `type` is primary, `faith` is ce. Affiliated with church.\n- **Row 7 (Reddings):** `type` is primary, `faith` is `-`. No affiliation.\n- **Row 8 (St Albert the Great):** `type` is primary, `faith` is rc. Affiliated with church.\n- **Row 9 (Tudor):** `type` is primary, `faith` is `-`. No affiliation.\n- **Row 10 (Two Waters):** `type` is primary, `faith` is `-`. No affiliation.\n\nCounting the schools without a faith affiliation (`faith` is `-`), we have: Belswains, Chamberbury, Hobbs Hill Wood, Lime Walk, Reddings, Tudor, and Two Waters.

These are Rows 1 through 10 in the table.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Data**:\n   - For each primary school, extract the OFSTED number from the column labeled `ofsted number`.\n\n3. **Check OFSTED Numbers**: \n   - Compare each extracted OFSTED number against the threshold of 117107.\n   \n4. **Analyze Each Row**:\n\n   - **Row 1 (belswains)**: OFSTED number is 117365, which is greater than 117107.\n   - **Row 2 (chambersbury)**: OFSTED number is 117214, which is greater than 117107.\n   - **Row 3 (hobbs hill wood)**: OFSTED number is 117368, which is greater than 117107.\n   - **Row 4 (leverstock green)**: OFSTED number is 117416, which is greater than 117107.\n   - **Row 5 (lime walk)**: OFSTED number is 117333, which is greater than 117107.\n   - **Row 6 (nash mills)**: OFSTED number is 117418, which is greater than 117107.\n   - **Row 7 (reddings)**: OFSTED number is 117234, which is greater than 117107.\n   - **Row 8 (st albert the great)**: Although this row has a type of \"primary\" and an OFSTED number of 117471, it specifies `faith` as \"rc\", indicating a religious primary school. Nonetheless, for checking against the claim, it is still relevant.\n   - **Row 9 (tudor)**: OFSTED number is 117109, which is greater than 117107.\n   - **Row 10 (two waters)**: OFSTED number is 117108, which is greater than 117107.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - All listed primary schools have an OFSTED number greater than 117107.
