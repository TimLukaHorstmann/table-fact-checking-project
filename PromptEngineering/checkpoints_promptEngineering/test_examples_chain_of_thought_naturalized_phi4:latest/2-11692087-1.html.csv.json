    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the Coquitlam Adanacs making 1177 points over 45 seasons is true or false, let's go through a step-by-step analysis based on the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The statement claims that the team has made 1177 points in total over 45 seasons.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Information**:\n   - We are interested in the \"points\" column for each season from 1965 to 2009.\n   - Additionally, there is a row labeled as \"total\" which summarizes data across all seasons.\n\n3. **Check Each Season's Points**: \n   - Examine the points scored by the team for each individual season listed (Rows 1 through 44).\n   - Sum up these values manually or confirm using the summarized data in Row 46.\n\n4. **Verify with Total Row**:\n   - The total row (Row 46) provides an aggregate of games played, losses, and points over all seasons.\n   - According to this row, the team has accumulated a total of 1177 points across the 45 seasons.\n\n5. **Cross-Verification**: \n   - Sum the points from each season manually or verify against Row 46 for consistency.\n   - Each season's point total should be correctly added up to match the \"total\" row\u2019s point value.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - If the summation of points from all seasons matches the number given in the total row, then the claim is accurate.\n\n### Verification:\n\n- The total points listed for 45 seasons in Row 46 is indeed 1177.\n- This confirms that the statement \"the coquitlam adanacs have make 1177 point over 45 season\" is correct based on the data provided.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells include all rows from 1 to 44 under the \"points\" column, and Row 46 for verification of total points.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim that the Coquitlam Adanacs made 1177 points over 45 seasons, we first identify the relevant data in the table.
