    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into two parts: whether \"the decision be always mclean\" and whether only a few dates take place in May.\n\n### Part 1: Decision by McClean\n\n1. **Check each row for the 'decision' column**:\n   - Row 1: decision is mclean\n   - Row 2: decision is mclean\n   - Row 3: decision is mclean\n   - Row 4: decision is mclean\n   - Row 5: decision is mclean\n   - Row 6: decision is mclean\n\n2. **Conclusion**: In every row, the decision is always McClean.\n\n### Part 2: Dates in May\n\n1. **Check each row for the 'date' column**:\n   - Row 1: date is may 2\n   - Row 2: date is may 5\n   - Row 3: date is may 7\n   - Row 4: date is may 9\n   - Row 5: date is may 11\n   - Row 6: date is may 13\n\n2. **Conclusion**: All dates listed are in May.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- The claim states \"the decision be always mclean,\" which is true as verified from all rows.\n- The claim also states \"only few date take place in may.\" However, all six dates provided are in May, indicating that not just a few but all dates are in May.
