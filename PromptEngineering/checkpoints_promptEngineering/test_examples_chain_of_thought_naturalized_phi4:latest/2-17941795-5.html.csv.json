These are:\n     - Row 1: class d i, quantity 15\n     - Row 2: class d ii (old), quantity 4\n     - Row 4: class d iii, quantity 6\n     - Row 5: class d iv, quantity 132\n\n2. **Compare Quantities for Type \"b n2t\":**\n   - We have the following quantities for each class:\n     - Class d i: Quantity 15 (Row 1)\n     - Class d ii (old): Quantity 4 (Row 2)\n     - Class d iii: Quantity 6 (Row 4)\n     - Class d iv: Quantity 132 (Row 5)\n\n3. **Determine the Lowest Quantity:**\n   - The lowest quantity among these is 4, which corresponds to class d ii (old) in Row 2.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"of the locomotive with a type b n2t, the one with the lowest quantity be a class d i\".\n   - From our analysis, the class with the lowest quantity is actually d ii (old), not d i.\n   \n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 1: Quantity of class d i\n- Row 2: Quantity of class d ii (old)\n- Row 4: Quantity of class d iii\n- Row 5: Quantity of class d iv\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified rows with type 'b n2t' and compared their quantities.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about locomotives of class `r 4 / 4` being type `c n2t` and having numbers greater than 4000 is true or false, we need to carefully examine the table entries related to this specific class. Here are the steps for our reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: We need to find rows in the table where the class is `r 4 / 4`. According to the provided data:\n   - Row 19 mentions class: `r 4 / 4`.\n   - Row 20 also mentions class: `r 4 / 4`.\n\n2. **Check Type for Each Relevant Row**:\n   - For Row 19, check if the type is `c n2t`:\n     - The entry states the type as `d n2t`, which does not match `c n2t`.\n   - For Row 20, check if the type is `c n2t`:\n     - The entry states the type as `d n2t`, which also does not match `c n2t`.\n\n3. **Check Number for Each Relevant Row**:\n   - Regardless of the mismatch in type, let's verify the number condition (greater than 4000) to ensure completeness:\n   - For Row 19: The numbers are from `4151` to `4183`, all greater than 4000.\n   - For Row 20: The numbers are from `4184` to `4192`, again, all greater than 4000.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states that *all* locomotives of class `r 4 / 4` should be type `c n2t`. However, both Row 19 and Row 20 show the type as `d n2t`, not `c n2t`.\n   - Since the condition for type does not hold true in either row, the claim is false regardless of the number condition being satisfied.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The relevant rows for class 'r 4 / 4' are Row 19 and Row 20.
