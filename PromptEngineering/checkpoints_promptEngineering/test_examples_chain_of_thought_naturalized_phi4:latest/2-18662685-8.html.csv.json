The rank must be greater than 4.\n2. The country must be Japan.\n3. For these entries, the notes should show \"sc / d\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Rank Greater Than 4:**\n   - Row 5: Rank is 5\n   - Row 6: Rank is 6\n\n2. **Check if Any of These Rows Have Japan as the Country:**\n   - From the identified rows (5 and 6), check their country:\n     - Row 5: Country is India.\n     - Row 6: Country is South Korea.\n\n3. **Conclusion Based on Conditions:**\n   - None of the rows with rank greater than 4 have Japan as the country.\n\nSince there are no entries where both conditions (rank > 4 and country = Japan) are satisfied, we do not need to check the notes for \"sc / d\" because the primary condition is already unmet.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe claim is FALSE because there are no rows where the rank is greater than 4 and the country is Japan.
