    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze each player's club for the year 2008 from the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim**: The claim states that only one of the twelve players was not in \"tours vb\" (a volleyball club) in 2008. This implies that eleven players should be listed as being part of \"tours vb.\"\n\n2. **Examine Each Row for Club Information**:\n   - **Row 1**: nikola kova\u010devi\u0107, 2008 club: rpa perugia\n   - **Row 2**: dejan bojovi\u0107, 2008 club: gabeca montichiari\n   - **Row 3**: novica bjelica, 2008 club: copra nordmeccanica\n   - **Row 4**: bojan jani\u0107, 2008 club: marmi lanza verona\n   - **Row 5**: vlado petkovi\u0107, 2008 club: budu\u0107nost podgorica\n   - **Row 6**: marko samard\u017ei\u0107, 2008 club: tours vb\n   - **Row 7**: nikola grbi\u0107, 2008 club: trentino volley\n   - **Row 8**: milo\u0161 niki\u0107, 2008 club: sparkling milano\n   - **Row 9**: andrija geri\u0107, 2008 club: lube banca marche\n   - **Row 10**: ivan miljkovi\u0107, 2008 club: m roma volley\n   - **Row 11**: sa\u0161a starovi\u0107, 2008 club: budu\u0107nost podgorica\n   - **Row 12**: marko podra\u0161\u010danin, 2008 club: famigliulo corigliano\n\n3. **Count the Number of Players in \"tours vb\"**:\n   - From the list above, only one player, marko samard\u017ei\u0107 (Row 6), is associated with \"tours vb.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since only one player is listed as being part of \"tours vb,\" and not eleven, the claim that only one player was not in \"tours vb\" is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 6: \"marko samard\u017ei\u0107\", 2008 club: tours vb\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that only one of the twelve players was not in 'tours vb' in 2008, implying eleven should be.
