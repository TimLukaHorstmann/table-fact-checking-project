Higher totals generally indicate a higher rank unless tied, where other factors might apply (not specified here).\n   - Therese Johaug has 4 total medals (2 gold, 1 silver, 1 bronze).\n   - Charlotte Kalla has 2 total medals (0 gold, 2 silver, 0 bronze).\n\n4. **Logical Conclusion:**\n   - Given that Therese Johaug has more total medals than Charlotte Kalla, it is unlikely she would be ranked lower than someone with fewer total medals unless there are additional criteria not provided in the table.\n   - Therefore, it is logically inconsistent for Therese Johaug to drop from rank 3 to rank 18 while Charlotte Kalla rises to rank 3 based solely on the medal counts.\n\n5. **Final Assessment:**\n   - The claim contradicts the logical order of ranking based on total medals unless additional unstated criteria are considered.\n   - Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Therese Johaug (Row 3): `rank`, `gold`, `silver`, `bronze`, `total`.\n- Charlotte Kalla (Row 20): `rank`, `gold`, `silver`, `bronze`, `total`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The current ranks are Therese Johaug at rank 3 and Charlotte Kalla at rank 18.
