    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"arizona be the college who have the last draft pick\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table and identify which colleges are associated with each player listed, focusing on identifying the college of the player selected as the last pick in this dataset.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Last Draft Pick:**\n   - The table lists draft picks from round 1 to round 11.\n   - The last entry (Row 12) shows a pick at round 11, pick number 293 for player Al Edwards.\n\n2. **Determine the College of the Last Drafted Player:**\n   - In Row 12, we see that Al Edwards's college is Northwestern State, LA.\n\n3. **Check Other Players from Arizona:**\n   - Identify all rows where the college is listed as \"arizona.\"\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 3: Glenn Parker (Guard) from Arizona.\n     - Row 5: John Nies (Punter) from Arizona.\n\n4. **Compare with the Last Draft Pick:**\n   - The last draft pick, Al Edwards, does not belong to Arizona; he is from Northwestern State, LA.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim states that \"arizona be the college who have the last draft pick,\" which implies that a player from Arizona should hold the final draft position.\n- Based on our analysis, the last draft pick (Row 12) is from Northwestern State, not Arizona. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 5: College for John Nies (Arizona).\n- Row 3: College for Glenn Parker (Arizona).\n- Row 12: College for Al Edwards (Northwestern State, LA).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the last draft pick in the table, which is at round 11, pick 293.\",\n    \"Determine the college of the player with this last pick: Northwestern State, LA.\",\n    \"Check all rows for players from Arizona to see if any are associated with the last draft pick.\",\n    \"Conclude that since the last pick is not from Arizona, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
