This does not match any part of the claim.\n   - **Row 2:** Year is 2013, Ceremony is AVN Award, Result is Nominated, Award is Most Outrageous Sex Scene (with Kelly Madison). This also does not match the claim.\n   - **Row 3:** Year is 2013, Ceremony is NightMoves Award, Result is Won, Award is Best Cougar / MILF Performer. This does not match either.\n   - **Row 4:** Year is 2013, Ceremony is NightMoves Award, Result is Nominated, Award is Best Ass. Again, this does not match the claim.\n   - **Row 5:** Year is 2013, Ceremony is XBIZ Award, Result is Nominated, Award is Web Star of the Year. This row matches the award, ceremony, and year but indicates \"Nominated\" as the result, not \"Won.\"\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim Against Row 5:**\n   - The claim requires that Brandi Love won the award.\n   - According to Row 5, the result was \"Nominated,\" not \"Won.\"\n   - There is no mention of Brandi Love in any row.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The table shows that the Web Star of the Year award at the XBIZ Award ceremony in 2013 resulted in a nomination, not a win.\n- Additionally, there is no information about Brandi Love being associated with this award or result.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table indicates that for the Web Star of the Year at the XBIZ Award ceremony in 2013, the result was 'Nominated,' not 'Won.'
