    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Reuben Morgan, Jad Gillies, and Darlene Zschech be the only worship leaders who be featured on multiple songs\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table data focusing specifically on the 'worship leader' column and identify how many times each person appears.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Column**: The relevant column for this task is the \"worship leader\" column. We'll examine each row to see who is listed as the worship leader and count their appearances across different songs.\n\n2. **Count Appearances**:\n   - **Row 1**: Joel Houston\n   - **Row 2**: Toni Romero\n   - **Row 3**: Darlene Zschech (1st appearance)\n   - **Row 4**: Jad Gillies (1st appearance)\n   - **Row 5**: Annie Garratt\n   - **Row 6**: Darlene Zschech (2nd appearance)\n   - **Row 7**: Dave Ware\n   - **Row 8**: Reuben Morgan (1st appearance)\n   - **Row 9**: Matt Crocker\n   - **Row 10**: Jad Gillies (2nd appearance)\n   - **Row 11**: Brooke Fraser\n   - **Row 12**: Reuben Morgan & Darlene Zschech (Reuben's 2nd, Darlene's 3rd appearances)\n   - **Row 13**: Reuben Morgan (3rd appearance)\n\n3. **Tally the Counts**:\n   - Joel Houston: 1 song\n   - Toni Romero: 1 song\n   - Darlene Zschech: 3 songs (Rows 3, 6, and part of 12)\n   - Jad Gillies: 2 songs (Rows 4 and 10)\n   - Annie Garratt: 1 song\n   - Dave Ware: 1 song\n   - Reuben Morgan: 3 songs (Rows 8, 12, and 13)\n   - Matt Crocker: 1 song\n   - Brooke Fraser: 1 song\n\n4. **Determine if Others are Featured on Multiple Songs**:\n   - Only Darlene Zschech, Jad Gillies, and Reuben Morgan appear as worship leaders on multiple songs (2 or more times each).\n\n5. **Verify the Claim**: The claim states that these three individuals should be \"the only\" ones featured on multiple songs. Based on our tally, no other individual appears as a worship leader for more than one song.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is TRUE because Darlene Zschech, Jad Gillies, and Reuben Morgan are indeed the only worship leaders who appear on multiple songs according to the table data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Focus on the 'worship leader' column in the table.\",\n    \"Count appearances of each worship leader across all rows.\",\n    \"Identify which worship leaders appear more than once.\",\n    \"Verify that only Reuben Morgan, Jad Gillies, and Darlene Zschech appear multiple times.\",\n    \"Confirm no other worship leader appears on more than one song.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"worship leader\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"worship leader\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"worship leader\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"worship leader\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"worship leader\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"worship leader\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"worship leader\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
