    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, let's break down the steps needed to verify it:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information**: \n   - The claim mentions two parishes: Dumbarton and Clarendon.\n   - It provides specific information about their areas in square kilometers.\n\n2. **Locate the Rows for Each Parish**:\n   - According to the table, each parish is listed by its official name and corresponding row number.\n\n3. **Extract Area Information for Dumbarton**:\n   - Find the row where \"dumbarton\" is listed as the official name.\n   - Check the column labeled \"area km 2\" for this row.\n   - Row 13 lists Dumbarton with an area of 375.06 square kilometers.\n\n4. **Extract Area Information for Clarendon**:\n   - Find the row where \"clarendon\" is listed as the official name.\n   - Check the column labeled \"area km 2\" for this row.\n   - Row 15 lists Clarendon with an area of 492.84 square kilometers.\n\n5. **Compare Extracted Data with Claim**:\n   - The claim states Dumbarton has an area of 6.20 square kilometers, but we found it to be 375.06 square kilometers.\n   - The claim correctly states Clarendon's area as 492.84 square kilometers.\n\n6. **Determine the Truth Value**:\n   - Since one part of the claim (Dumbarton's area) is incorrect while the other part (Clarendon's area) is correct, the entire claim is false.\n\n7. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - For Dumbarton: Row 13, \"area km 2\".\n   - For Clarendon: Row 15, \"area km 2\".\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Dumbarton has an area of 6.20 square kilometers and Clarendon has an area of 492.84 square kilometers. Checking the table, Dumbarton is listed in Row 13 with an area of 375.06 square kilometers, not 6.20 as claimed. Clarendon in Row 15 does indeed have an area of 492.84 square kilometers, which matches the claim. Therefore, since part of the claim about Dumbarton's area is incorrect, the entire claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"area km 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"area km 2\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
