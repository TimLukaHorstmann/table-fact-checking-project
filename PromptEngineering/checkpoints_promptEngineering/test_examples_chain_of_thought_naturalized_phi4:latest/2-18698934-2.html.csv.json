    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the game on 9 February 2011 finishing with a score of 2 - 2 is true or false, we will examine the table for relevant information.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - We need to locate the row corresponding to the date \"9 february 2011\" in the table.\n   - By examining each row's date column:\n     - Row 1: Date is \"20 june 2010\"\n     - Row 2: Date is \"2 november 2010\"\n     - **Row 3: Date is \"26 january 2011\"**\n     - **Row 4: Date is \"9 february 2011\"** (This matches the date in question)\n     - Row 5: Date is \"3 june 2010\"\n\n2. **Check the Result for the Relevant Game:**\n   - Once we have identified Row 4 as containing the relevant game, we look at the 'result' column for that row.\n   - According to Row 4 in the table, the result is \"1 - 4\".\n\n3. **Compare with Claimed Result:**\n   - The claim states that the game on 9 February 2011 finished with a score of \"2 - 2\".\n   - The actual result from the table for this date is \"1 - 4\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Since the claimed result (\"2 - 2\") does not match the recorded result (\"1 - 4\"), the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nThe relevant cell in the table that helps us determine the veracity of the claim is from Row 4, specifically from the \"result\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified Row 4 as containing the game on '9 february 2011'. The result for this game was '1 - 4', which does not match the claimed score of '2 - 2'.
