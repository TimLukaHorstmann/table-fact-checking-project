Not all medals are bronze.\n   - **Rows 18-21 (Denmark, Germany, Sweden, Tajikistan)**: Each has gold = 0, silver = 1, bronze = 0, total = 1. Medals are silver, not bronze.\n   - **Row 23-31 (Albania to Venezuela)**: Each has gold = 0, silver = 0, bronze = 1, total = 1. These rows satisfy the condition of having exactly one bronze medal.\n\n5. **Counting Valid Rows**:\n   - From the analysis above, rows 23 through 31 are valid for the claim, as each of these countries has exactly one bronze medal.\n   - This gives us a total of 9 countries (Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Czech Republic, Kyrgyzstan, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Venezuela).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The claim states there are 10 such countries, but we only found 9.\n\n7. **Final Answer**:\n   - The claim is FALSE because there are only 9 countries with exactly one bronze medal, not 10.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
