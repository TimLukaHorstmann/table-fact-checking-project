    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"1 of the judge be appoint by luis fortu\u00f1o\" is true or false, we need to analyze the information provided in the table regarding which judges were appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information**: The claim involves identifying how many judges were appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o. Therefore, we will focus on the \"appointed by\" column of each row in the table.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: Anabelle Rodr\u00edguez was appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n.\n   - **Row 2**: Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n   - **Row 3**: Erick Kolthoff Caraballo was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n   - **Row 4**: Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton was appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n.\n   - **Row 5**: Liana Fiol Matta was appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n.\n   - **Row 6**: Luis Estrella Mart\u00ednez was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n   - **Row 7**: Mildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n   - **Row 8**: Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n   - **Row 9**: Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n\n3. **Count the Judges Appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o**:\n   - From the examination, we see that Rows 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9 indicate judges appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n   - Total count: 6 judges were appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**: The claim states \"1 of the judge be appoint by luis fortu\u00f1o\". Our analysis shows that 6 judges were actually appointed by him, not just one.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since more than one judge was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells are those in the \"appointed by\" column for each row where the appointment was made by Luis Fortu\u00f1o:\n- Row 2: `luis fortu\u00f1o`\n- Row 3: `luis fortu\u00f1o`\n- Row 6: `luis fortu\u00f1o`\n- Row 7: `luis fortu\u00f1o`\n- Row 8: `luis fortu\u00f1o`\n- Row 9: `luis fortu\u00f1o`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the column related to 'appointed by' to check for appointments made by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\",\n    \"Examine each row in the table and note who appointed each judge.\",\n    \"Count how many judges were appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\",\n    \"Compare this count with the claim that only 1 judge was appointed by him.\",\n    \"Determine the truthfulness of the claim based on the comparison.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
