During this stage, Thierry Marie held both the general and points classifications but there was no specific mention of him holding or competing for a mountain classification since it wasn't awarded.\n\nThus, Thierry Marie is the rider associated with the stage when the mountain classification was not awarded, making him effectively \"the only one\" in that context.
