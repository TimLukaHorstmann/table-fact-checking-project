However, the table does not provide round information.\n   - Since round information is absent in the provided data, we cannot verify this part of the claim solely based on the given table.\n\n5. **Determine Outcome**:\n   - The claim states that Richmond \"beat St Kilda\".\n   - From Row 1: Richmond scored more points (110) than St Kilda (56), confirming Richmond did beat St Kilda.\n\nBased on the analysis, all parts of the claim except for the round information align with data from the table.
