    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"2 player in the nightwatchman (cricket) come from australia\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to understand what a nightwatchman is in cricket. A nightwatchman is typically a lower-order batsman who bats higher up the order than usual, often at number seven or eight, to protect better batsmen while facing potentially difficult bowling conditions during twilight.\n\nLet's analyze each row of the table to check if any Australian players might fit this description:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Player: Nasim-ul-Ghani, Team: Pakistan. This is not relevant as it does not involve an Australian player.\n\n2. **Row 2**: Player: Tony Mann, Team: Australia. The score is 105 against India in 1977. While a high individual score is impressive, the role of nightwatchman typically involves lower scores and batting early to protect other batsmen. This does not indicate he was playing as a nightwatchman.\n\n3. **Row 3**: Player: Syed Kirmani, Team: India. Again, this row does not involve an Australian player.\n\n4. **Row 4**: Player: Mark Boucher, Team: South Africa. No relevance to the claim about Australian players.\n\n5. **Row 5**: Player: Mark Boucher, Team: South Africa. Similar reasoning as Row 4.\n\n6. **Row 6**: Player: Jason Gillespie, Team: Australia. He scored 201 not out against Bangladesh in 2006. A score of 201 not out is highly unlikely for a nightwatchman, as they are generally expected to bat defensively and make minimal scores. This does not fit the typical profile or situation where a player acts as a nightwatchman.\n\nFrom this analysis:\n- None of the Australian players listed (Tony Mann and Jason Gillespie) appear to have been playing in situations consistent with being a nightwatchman.\n- The information provided does not support the claim that two Australian players acted as nightwatchmen.\n\nThus, based on the data available:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"A nightwatchman is typically expected to bat defensively and make lower scores.
