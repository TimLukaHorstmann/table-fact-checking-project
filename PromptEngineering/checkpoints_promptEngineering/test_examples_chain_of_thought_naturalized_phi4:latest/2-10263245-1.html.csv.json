    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the match against Lucian Bute be the only fight that Librado Andrade lose\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table for all instances of fights with the result labeled as a \"loss.\" Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify All Losses**: First, we must identify every row where the result is recorded as a \"loss.\"\n\n2. **Check Opponent Name**: For each loss, check if the opponent was Lucian Bute.\n\n3. **Count and Compare**: Count how many times Librado Andrade lost to opponents other than Lucian Bute.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Row 1**: \n   - Result: Loss\n   - Opponent: Rowland Bryant\n   - This is a loss not against Lucian Bute.\n\n2. **Row 3**:\n   - Result: Loss\n   - Opponent: Aaron Pryor Jr.\n   - This is another loss not against Lucian Bute.\n\n3. **Row 5**: \n   - Result: Loss\n   - Opponent: Lucian Bute\n\n4. **Row 7**: \n   - Result: Loss\n   - Opponent: Lucian Bute\n\nFrom the table, we see that Librado Andrade has lost fights against Rowland Bryant and Aaron Pryor Jr., in addition to losing two matches against Lucian Bute.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim states that the match against Lucian Bute was the only fight Librado Andrade lost.
