    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"kansas city have no post - season record in 2013\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data related to the year 2013, focusing on the team Kansas City.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - We look for a row where the \"mlb affiliate\" is \"kansas city\". According to the table:\n     - Row 13 has \"mlb affiliate\": kansas city.\n\n2. **Check Post-Season Records:**\n   - For Kansas City in 2013 (Row 13), we need to examine the columns \"post - season record\" and \"post - season win %\".\n   - In Row 13, both \"post - season record\" and \"post - season win %\" are marked as \"-\".\n\n3. **Interpretation of Data:**\n   - The \"-\" symbol in these columns typically indicates that there is no post-season record for that year.\n   - This implies Kansas City did not have a post-season appearance or any wins/losses recorded in the postseason for 2013.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the data in Row 13, it confirms that Kansas City had no post-season record in 2013.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table entry for the year 2013 shows 'mlb affiliate' as kansas city.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"houston have no post - season record,\" we need to analyze the table for any entries related to Houston's team with a non-empty post-season record.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: \n   - The table includes multiple rows where the MLB affiliate is listed as \"houston.\" We should focus on these rows to check their post-season records.\n   \n2. **Examine Each Row for Post-Season Record**:\n   - **Row 1 (2001)**: \n     - `post - season record`: 4 - 0\n     - This indicates a non-empty post-season record.\n   - **Row 2 (2002)**:\n     - `post - season record`: -\n     - No post-season activity is recorded here.\n   - **Row 3 (2003 \u2666)**: \n     - `post - season record`: 0 - 2\n     - This indicates a non-empty post-season record.\n   - **Rows 4 to 11**: \n     - Each has an empty (`-`) post-season record, indicating no activity.\n   - **Row 12 (2012)**:\n     - `post - season record`: -\n     - No post-season activity is recorded here.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - From the above examination, we see that in Row 1 and Row 3, Houston has a non-empty post-season record (4-0 and 0-2 respectively). Therefore, it's incorrect to claim \"houston have no post - season record.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows two instances where the 'post - season record' for Houston is non-empty: in 2001 (4 - 0) and in 2003 \u2666 (0 - 2).
