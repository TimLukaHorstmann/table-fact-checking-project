In this context, \"completed\" refers to the completion of construction for a project as indicated by the presence of a date in the \"construction completed\" column.\n\n2. **Examine the Table**:\n   - We will go through each row and check the \"construction completed\" column to see if it contains a date (i.e., is not \"-\").\n\n3. **Identify Completed Projects**:\n   - **Row 1**: Construction completed: \"-\"\n   - **Row 2**: Construction completed: \"-\"\n   - **Row 3**: Construction completed: \"-\"\n   - **Row 4**: Construction completed: \"09 / 17 / 1993\"\n   - **Row 5**: Construction completed: \"08 / 08 / 1997\"\n   - **Row 6**: Construction completed: \"-\"\n   - **Row 7**: Construction completed: \"-\"\n   - **Row 8**: Construction completed: \"-\"\n   - **Row 9**: Construction completed: \"12 / 30 / 1982\"\n\n4. **Count the Completed Projects**:\n   - From the above examination, we find that there are three projects with a date in the \"construction completed\" column:\n     - Row 4\n     - Row 5\n     - Row 9\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states that only 3 projects have been completed.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Potter Co in Copiah be the first project propose, but the last to be list\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table regarding proposal dates and listing dates for all projects.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Proposal Dates:**\n   - We will examine the 'proposed' column across all rows to find out which project was proposed first.\n   - Row 4 (Flowood Site) has a proposal date of 09 / 08 / 1983.\n   - Row 5 (Newsom Brothers/Old Reichhold Chemicals, Inc) has a proposal date of 10 / 15 / 1984.\n   - Row 9 (Walcotte Chemical Co Warehouses) does not have a specific proposed date, but it is mentioned that cleanup was completed before the formal creation of NPL, so we will treat it as not applicable for the first proposal.\n   - Row 2 (Chemfax, Inc.) has a proposal date of 06 / 23 / 1993.\n   - Row 7 (Potter Co) has a proposal date of 05 / 10 / 1993.\n   - Row 1 (American Creosote Works, Inc) has a proposal date of 06 / 14 / 2001.\n   - Row 3 (Davis Timber Company) has a proposal date of 05 / 11 / 2000.\n   - Row 6 (Picayune Wood Treating) has a proposal date of 03 / 08 / 2004.\n   - Row 8 (Sonford Products) has a proposal date of 09 / 27 / 2006.\n\n2. **Determine the Earliest Proposal Date:**\n   - The earliest proposal date is for Flowood Site on 09 / 08 / 1983, which is in Row 4.\n   - Therefore, Potter Co (Row 7) is not the first project proposed.\n\n3. **Identify Listing Dates:**\n   - We will examine the 'listed' column across all rows to find out which project was listed last.\n   - Row 8 (Sonford Products) has a listing date of 03 / 07 / 2007, which is the latest among those provided.\n   - Row 4 (Flowood Site) has a listing date of 09 / 21 / 1984.\n   - Row 5 (Newsom Brothers/Old Reichhold Chemicals, Inc.) has a listing date of 06 / 10 / 1986.\n   - Row 3 (Davis Timber Company) has a listing date of 07 / 27 / 2000.\n   - Row 1 (American Creosote Works, Inc) has a listing date of 09 / 13 / 2001.\n   - Row 6 (Picayune Wood Treating) has a listing date of 07 / 22 / 2004.\n   - Row 7 (Potter Co) does not have a listed date provided.\n   - Rows 2 and 9 indicate that the projects were not listed, or cleanup was completed before formal NPL creation.\n\n4. **Determine if Potter Co is the Last to be Listed:**\n   - Since Row 7 (Potter Co) has no listing date, it cannot be considered as being listed last.\n   - The last project to be listed is Sonford Products on 03 / 07 / 2007 in Row 8.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Potter Co was not the first project proposed since Flowood Site was proposed earlier.\n- Potter Co does not have a listing date, and thus cannot be considered as being listed last.
