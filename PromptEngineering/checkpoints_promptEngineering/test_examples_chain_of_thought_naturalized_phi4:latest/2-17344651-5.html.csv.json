A win margin is calculated as the difference between the points scored by the Celtics and the points scored by their opponent.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the games won by the Boston Celtics in December**: We'll go through each row to identify which games were wins (i.e., where the score of the Celtics was higher than that of their opponents).\n\n2. **Calculate the win margin for each game**: For each winning game, calculate the win margin as `Celtics' points - Opponent's points`.\n\n3. **Find the largest win margin**: Compare all calculated win margins to determine the largest one.\n\nLet's evaluate each relevant row:\n\n- **Row 1**: Date: Sat Dec 1; Score: 110 - 104 (Win); Margin = 110 - 104 = 6\n- **Row 2**: Date: Sun Dec 2; Score: 122 - 99 (Win); Margin = 122 - 99 = 23\n- **Row 3**: Date: Tue Dec 4; Score: 99 - 104 (Loss)\n- **Row 4**: Date: Wed Dec 5; Score: 123 - 107 (Win); Margin = 123 - 107 = 16\n- **Row 5**: Date: Sat Dec 8; Score: 107 - 98 (Win); Margin = 107 - 98 = 9\n- **Row 6**: Date: Sun Dec 9; Score: 128 - 127 (Win); Margin = 128 - 127 = 1\n- **Row 7**: Date: Tue Dec 11; Score: 130 - 121 (Loss)\n- **Row 8**: Date: Wed Dec 12; Score: 107 - 110 (Loss)\n- **Row 9**: Date: Fri Dec 14; Score: 117 - 106 (Win); Margin = 117 - 106 = 11\n- **Row 10**: Date: Sat Dec 15; Score: 101 - 94 (Win); Margin = 101 - 94 = 7\n- **Row 11**: Date: Tue Dec 18; Score: 126 - 108 (Win); Margin = 126 - 108 = 18\n- **Row 12**: Date: Wed Dec 19; Score: 92 - 107 (Loss)\n- **Row 13**: Date: Fri Dec 21; Score: 117 - 107 (Win); Margin = 117 - 107 = 10\n- **Row 14**: Date: Sat Dec 22; Score: 85 - 110 (Loss)\n\nFrom the calculations above, we can see that the largest win margin was 23 points in Game 2 on December 2.\n\n**Conclusion**: The claim is true since the largest win margin for the Boston Celtics in December was indeed 23 points.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified all games won by the Boston Celtics in December.

Since the Celtics' score is higher than that of the Clippers, they won this game.\n\nThe second part of the claim states that they lost the game on Thursday.
