We need to compare the actual issue price from the table to this value.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps using the data provided in the table:\n\n- **Step 1: Find the year 2008**:\n  - According to the table, Row 3 corresponds to the year 2008 with the theme \"amethyst crystal\".\n\n- **Step 2: Verify the theme for this row**:\n  - In Row 3, the theme is indeed \"amethyst crystal\", which matches our requirement.\n\n- **Step 3: Examine the issue price in this row**:\n  - The issue price listed in Row 3 is 94.95.\n\n- **Step 4: Compare the issue price to 95**:\n  - We need to determine if 94.95 is greater than 95.\n  - Clearly, 94.95 is less than 95.\n\nThus, the claim that \"the amethyst crystal theme in 2008 have an issue price of greater than 95\" is FALSE.\n\nHere's the final output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the relevant year: The claim mentions 2008.\",\n    \"Locate the theme within that year: Find 'amethyst crystal' for 2008.\",\n    \"Check the issue price for this theme: In Row 3, the issue price is 94.95.\",\n    \"Compare the issue price with 95: Since 94.95 < 95, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
