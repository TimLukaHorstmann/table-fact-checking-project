    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"1972 be the year when rowan barrett be bear\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant information provided in the table about Rowan Barrett.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Player:**\n   - The claim refers to \"Rowan Barrett,\" so we need to find his details in the table.\n   \n2. **Locate Rowan Barrett's Information:**\n   - In the table, Rowan Barrett is listed as:\n     - **Row 6**: player: rowan barrett, height: 1.97, position: f, year born (age): november 24 , 1972 (age41), current club: chalon - sur - sa\u00f4ne.\n   \n3. **Verify the Year of Birth:**\n   - The table states that Rowan Barrett was born on November 24, 1972.\n\n4. **Interpret the Claim:**\n   - The claim \"1972 be the year when rowan barrett be bear\" seems to imply that 1972 is related to Rowan Barrett's existence or birth.\n   - Given that the table confirms Rowan Barrett was born in 1972, this part of the claim is accurate.\n\n5. **Assess the Rest of the Claim:**\n   - The phrase \"be bear\" does not have a clear meaning in this context and seems to be either a typographical error or nonsensical.\n   - Since there is no information about Rowan Barrett being a bear, this part of the claim cannot be verified as true.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - While 1972 is indeed the year Rowan Barrett was born, the statement \"be bear\" does not make logical sense and lacks verification from the table.\n   - Therefore, the entire claim cannot be considered true due to the unclear and unverifiable part of it.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim refers to Rowan Barrett's year of birth as 1972, which is confirmed by the table.
