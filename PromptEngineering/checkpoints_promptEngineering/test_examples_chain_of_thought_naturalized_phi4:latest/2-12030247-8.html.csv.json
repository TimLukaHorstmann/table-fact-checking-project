This indicates that these candidates did not receive any loans.\n   - For Mike Gravel (Row 8), the entry is \"-10000\", which implies he received a loan of $10,000.

This indicates he did receive a loan of $10,000 in Q2.\n\n2. **Compare Money Raised in Q2 Among All Candidates:**\n   - We need to compare the \"money raised , 2q\" for all candidates:\n     - Hillary Clinton (Row 1): $27,021,358\n     - Barack Obama (Row 2): $33,120,440\n     - John Edwards (Row 3): $9,097,495\n     - Bill Richardson (Row 4): $7,090,278\n     - Christopher Dodd (Row 5): $3,280,284\n     - Joe Biden (Row 6): $2,451,180\n     - Dennis Kucinich (Row 7): $757,035\n     - Mike Gravel (Row 8): $140,510\n\n   - The highest amount raised in Q2 is by Barack Obama with $33,120,440.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"Mike Gravel have no loan receive , 2q\" and also \"with the highest money raise , 2q\".\n   - From our analysis:\n     - Mike Gravel did receive a loan in Q2.\n     - He did not have the highest money raised; Barack Obama had the highest.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Both parts of the claim are false.
