We will compare these values to find the smallest one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Extract Attendance Figures**: \n   - Game 47: Rose Garden, Attendance = 20106\n   - Game 48: Staples Center, Attendance = 18997\n   - Game 49: Time Warner Cable Arena, Attendance = 19164\n   - Game 50: Time Warner Cable Arena, Attendance = 12376\n   - Game 51: Target Center, Attendance = 13352\n   - Game 52: Time Warner Cable Arena, Attendance = 13712\n   - Game 53: Time Warner Cable Arena, Attendance = 19568\n   - Game 54: Bradley Center, Attendance = 17174\n   - Game 55: Staples Center, Attendance = 15892\n   - Game 56: EnergySolutions Arena, Attendance = 19911\n\n2. **Identify the Lowest Attendance**: \n   - From the extracted figures, we compare all values to find the minimum.\n   - The lowest value is 12376 from Game 50.\n\n3. **Verify Against the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the lowest attendance figure for a game is 12376.\n   - Our comparison confirms that 12376 is indeed the smallest attendance number listed.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is accurate based on the data provided in the table.
