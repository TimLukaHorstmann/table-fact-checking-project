    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Place Ville Marie was the tallest building for the least amount of time\" is true or false, we need to evaluate the number of years each building served as the tallest from the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant data**:\n   - We need to compare the \"of years as tallest\" column across all buildings listed in the table.\n   \n2. **Extract the 'of years as tallest' for each building**:\n   - Notre Dame Basilica: 99 years\n   - Royal Bank Building: 3 years\n   - Sun Life Building: 31 years\n   - Tour CIBC: <1 year (this indicates less than a full year, but more specific duration not given)\n   - Place Ville Marie: 2 years\n   - Tour de la Bourse: 28 years\n   - 1000 De La Gaucheti\u00e8re: 21 years\n\n3. **Determine the least amount of time**:\n   - The smallest value in the \"of years as tallest\" column is <1 year for Tour CIBC.\n   - Place Ville Marie was the tallest for 2 years, which is more than the duration for Tour CIBC.\n\n4. **Conclusion based on comparison**:\n   - Since Tour CIBC served as the tallest building for less time (<1 year) compared to Place Ville Marie (2 years), the claim that \"Place Ville Marie be the tallest building for the least amount of year\" is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To determine whether 'Place Ville Marie was the tallest building for the least amount of time' is true, we compared the 'of years as tallest' column.
