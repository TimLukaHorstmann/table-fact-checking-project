    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the venues used on July 6, 1957, is true or false, we need to analyze each row of the table for information about the venue.\n\n**Step-by-step Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:**  \n   The claim states that \"western oval\" was not included in the six venues used on July 6, 1957. We need to check if \"western oval\" is mentioned as a venue in any of the rows for this date.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row:**  \n   - **Row 1:** Venue is \"arden street oval.\" (Not \"western oval\")\n   - **Row 2:** Venue is \"western oval.\" (Matches the claim we need to verify)\n   - **Row 3:** Venue is \"lake oval.\" (Not \"western oval\")\n   - **Row 4:** Venue is \"mcg.\" (Not \"western oval\")\n   - **Row 5:** Venue is \"windy hill.\" (Not \"western oval\")\n   - **Row 6:** Venue is \"glenferrie oval.\" (Not \"western oval\")\n\n3. **Determine the Validity of the Claim:**  \n   From the examination, we see that \"western oval\" appears as a venue in Row 2. This means it was indeed included among the venues used on July 6, 1957.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**  \n   Since \"western oval\" is listed as one of the venues, the claim that it was not included is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- The relevant cell for this determination is in Row 2 under the column \"venue.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states 'western oval' was not used on July 6, 1957.
