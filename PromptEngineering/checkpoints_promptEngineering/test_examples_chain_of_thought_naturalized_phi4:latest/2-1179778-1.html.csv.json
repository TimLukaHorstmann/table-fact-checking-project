    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate each row of the table for specific conditions based on the given claim:\n\n**Claim Analysis:**\n\"The numbered railway with a regular name and a number be 1 more than the station that be solely numbered.\"\n\nThis means:\n- We need to find entries where there is both a \"regular\" name (i.e., not just numbers) and a number.\n- Then, check if there's another entry which has only numbers as its name, and its number should be exactly one less than the first.\n\n**Step-by-step Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify Entries with Both a Regular Name and a Number:**\n   - Row 1: \"Irish Mail\" (regular name) and \"Number: Irish Mail\"\n   - Row 2: \"Joffre\" (regular name) and \"Number: Joffre\"\n   - Row 3: \"Montalban (22)\" (regular name with number)\n   - Row 4: \"Utrillas (21)\" (regular name with number)\n   - Row 5: \"No 45\" (partly regular, partly number)\n   - Row 6: \"No47\" (solely numbers)\n   - Row 7: \"No48\" (solely numbers)\n   - Row 8: \"Sybil\" (regular name) and \"Number: Sybil\"\n\n2. **Identify Entries with Solely Numbers as Names:**\n   - Row 5: \"No 45\"\n   - Row 6: \"No47\"\n   - Row 7: \"No48\"\n\n3. **Match Regular Named and Numbered Entries with Solely Numbered Entries:**\n   - For \"Montalban (22)\", check if there is a solely numbered entry with the number 21:\n     - Entry exists in row 4: \"Utrillas (21)\"\n   \n   - For \"Utrillas (21)\", check if there is a solely numbered entry with the number 20:\n     - No such entry exists.\n\n   - Other entries with regular names and numbers do not have corresponding solely numbered entries exactly one less than their number.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The condition holds true for \"Montalban (22)\" having its number be 1 more than \"Utrillas (21)\", which is a solely numbered name.\n  \nThus, the claim is TRUE based on the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify entries with both regular names and numbers: Rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8.\",\n    \"Identify solely numbered entries: Rows 5, 6, 7.\",\n    \"Match 'Montalban (22)' from Row 3 with 'Utrillas (21)' from Row 4 since 22 is 1 more than 21.\",\n    \"No other matches found that satisfy the condition of a number being exactly 1 more than another solely numbered entry.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"name / number\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"name / number\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
