    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim regarding the number of tie replays, we need to analyze each row from the provided data. Our goal is to identify how many replays were played during the 1995-96 FA Cup.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Understand Replay Identification**: \n   - A replay is identified by a \"tie no\" labeled as \"replay\". The column name indicates this clearly, such as \"Row 36\", \"Row 40\", and so on.\n   \n2. **Count Replays**:\n   - We will go through each row and identify rows where the \"tie no\" explicitly mentions \"replay\".\n   - Additionally, we consider ties with replays indicated by a match that was decided over two legs or more than one game (e.g., involving penalties).\n\n3. **Identify Relevant Rows**:\n   - Row 36: Mention of Chelsea winning on penalties indicates it went to extra time/replays.\n   - Row 40: Sheffield United vs Arsenal replay.\n   - Row 42: Tottenham Hotspur vs Hereford United replay.\n   - Row 44: Nottingham Forest vs Stoke City replay.\n   - Row 47: Wolverhampton Wanderers vs Birmingham City replay.\n\n4. **Verify Total Count**:\n   - The identified replays are Rows 36, 40, 42, 44, and 47.\n   - We have found a total of 5 distinct replays explicitly labeled as such.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states there were \"a total of 14 tie replays\". Our analysis shows only 5 replays, meaning the claim is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on our analysis, we conclude that the claim of having 14 replay ties in the FA Cup for the 1995-96 season is false. We identified only 5 such replays.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows where 'tie no' indicates a replay.\",\n    \"Count explicitly labeled replay matches and any involving extra time or penalties that imply replays.\",\n    \"Rows with replays are: 36, 40, 42, 44, 47.\",\n    \"Total replays identified is 5.\",\n    \"Claim states there were 14 replays; hence the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 40, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 42, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 44, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 47, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
