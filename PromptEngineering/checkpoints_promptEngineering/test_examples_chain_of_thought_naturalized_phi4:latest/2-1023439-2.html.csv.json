    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the data provided in the table for the album titled \"under the influence.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Row(s) Related to \"Under the Influence\":**\n   - We are looking for rows where the title is \"under the influence.\" From the table:\n     - Row 3 has `title: under the influence`.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Information from Row 3:**\n   - Year: 1986\n   - US Chart Position: 56\n\n3. **Check if There Are Any Other Rows for \"Under the Influence\":**\n   - No other rows have the title \"under the influence.\"\n\n4. **Verify the Claim Against the Extracted Data:**\n   - The claim states that \"under the influence\" charted at 56 in the US in both 1985 and 1986.\n   - From Row 3, we know it charted at position 56 in 1986.\n   - There is no data for \"under the influence\" in 1985.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim incorrectly states that \"under the influence\" charted at 56 in 1985, which is not supported by any row in the table.
