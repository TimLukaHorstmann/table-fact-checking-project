    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"rare name include adsl for asymmetric digital subscriber line\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim suggests that a \"rare name\" includes \"adsl\" which stands for \"asymmetric digital subscriber line.\" We need to verify if there is any entry in the table where \"adsl\" or a variation of it is listed as a \"common name.\"\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Column**: In the table, the column labeled \"common name\" will be relevant because this is where variations of \"adsl\" would appear.\n\n3. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: Common Name: adsl\n     - This directly matches \"adsl,\" which supports the claim.\n   - **Row 2**: Common Name: adsl (gdmt)\n     - Includes \"adsl,\" supporting the claim.\n   - **Row 3**: Common Name: adsl over pots\n     - Includes \"adsl,\" supporting the claim.\n   - **Row 4**: Common Name: adsl over isdn\n     - Includes \"adsl,\" supporting the claim.\n   - **Row 5**: Common Name: adsl lite (glite)\n     - Includes \"adsl,\" supporting the claim.\n   - **Row 6**: Common Name: adsl2\n     - Includes \"adsl,\" albeit in a variation, still supports the claim.\n   - **Row 7**: Common Name: adsl2\n     - Same as Row 6, includes \"adsl.\"\n   - **Row 8**: Common Name: re-adsl2\n     - Includes \"adsl\" in a variation, supporting the claim.\n   - **Row 9**: Common Name: splitterless adsl2\n     - Includes \"adsl,\" supporting the claim.\n   - **Row 10**: Common Name: adsl2+\n     - Includes \"adsl,\" supporting the claim.\n   - **Row 11**: Common Name: adsl2+ m\n     - Includes \"adsl,\" supporting the claim.\n   - **Row 12**: Common Name: adsl4\n     - Includes \"adsl\" in a variation, supporting the claim.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Every row that has \"adsl\" or its variations as part of the common name supports the claim. The term \"rare\" is subjective here, but since all instances include \"adsl,\" it can be considered true that such names are included for ADSL in the table.\n\n5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that a 'rare name' includes 'adsl' for asymmetric digital subscriber line.
