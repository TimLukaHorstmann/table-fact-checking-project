Here\u2019s how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information**: We focus on the column \"position\" for each player because this will tell us what role they were drafted for.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: Player is Don McLean, Position: Defense.\n   - **Row 2**: Player is Bob Sirois, Position: Right Wing.\n   - **Row 3**: Player is Randy Andreachuk, Position: Center.\n   - **Row 4**: Player is Dennis Sobchuk, Position: Center.\n   - **Row 5**: Player is Willie Friesen, Position: Left Wing.\n   - **Row 6**: Player is Reggie Lemelin, Position: Goaltender. (This row shows a player was drafted as a goaltender.)\n   - **Row 7**: Player is Steve Short, Position: Left Wing.\n   - **Row 8**: Player is Peter McKenzie, Position: Defense.\n   - **Row 9**: Player is Marcel Labrosse, Position: Center.\n   - **Row 10**: Player is Scott Jessee, Position: Right Wing.\n   - **Row 11**: Player is Richard Guay, Position: Goaltender. (This row also shows a player was drafted as a goaltender.)\n   - **Row 12**: Player is Brad Morrow, Position: Defense.\n   - **Row 13**: Player is Craig Arvidson, Position: Left Wing.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - From the examination, we can see that in Rows 6 and 11, players were indeed drafted for the position of \"goaltender\". This means there are entries where players were specifically selected for this role.\n   - Therefore, the claim \"all of the players were not drafted for the position of goaltender\" is false because there are at least two instances (Rows 6 and 11) contradicting it.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - Row 6: Position column shows \"goaltender\".\n   - Row 11: Position column shows \"goaltender\".\n\nPutting this together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that no players were drafted for the position of goaltender. Examining each row under the 'position' column, we find two instances (Rows 6 and 11) where players were indeed drafted as goaltenders. This contradicts the claim, making it false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
