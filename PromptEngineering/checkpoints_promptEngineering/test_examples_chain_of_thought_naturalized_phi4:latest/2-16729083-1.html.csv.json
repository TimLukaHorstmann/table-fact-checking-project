    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to verify two aspects from the data provided:\n\n1. **Opponent Verification:**\n   - We must confirm if \"kansas city chiefs\" was indeed the opponent in week 14.\n\n2. **Attendance Verification:**\n   - We need to check if the attendance for that game was 74,524.\n\nLet's go through these steps using the table data:\n\n1. **Locate Week 14 Data:**\n   - Look at Row 14 of the table as it corresponds to week 14.\n   - According to Row 14:\n     - Opponent: kansas city chiefs\n     - Attendance: 77778\n\n2. **Verify Opponent and Attendance:**\n   - The opponent listed for Week 14 is \"kansas city chiefs,\" which matches the claim's first condition.\n   - However, the attendance listed is 77,778, not 74,524 as stated in the claim.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - While the opponent in week 14 was indeed the kansas city chiefs, the attendance does not match the number given in the claim (74,524). Therefore, the claim is false because one part of it is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the data for Week 14. In Row 14, the opponent is 'kansas city chiefs' and the attendance is 77,778.
