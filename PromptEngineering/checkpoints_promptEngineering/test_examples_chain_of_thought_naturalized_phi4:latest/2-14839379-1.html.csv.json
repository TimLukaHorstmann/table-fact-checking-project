    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the model with 90% after 1 year have 80% after 3 years\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data for models that exhibit a capacity of 90% after one year and verify if they also show a capacity of 80% after three years.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n\n1. **Identify Models with 90% Capacity After 1 Year:**  \n   We will examine each row to find those where the \"after 1 year\" column has a value of 90%.\n\n2. **Verify Capacity After 3 Years for Identified Models:**  \n   For models identified in step 1, we need to check if they have a capacity of 80% after three years.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- **Row 4:** Model \"hr - 3utgb\" has a 90% capacity after 1 year and an 80% capacity after 3 years.\n  \n- **Row 5:** Model \"bk - 3 mcc\" has a 90% capacity after 1 year and an 80% capacity after 3 years.\n\n- **Row 8:** Model \"bk - 3lcc\" has a 90% capacity after 1 year and an 80% capacity after 3 years.\n  \n- **Row 12:** Model \"bk - 3hcc\" has a 90% capacity after 1 year and an 80% capacity after 3 years.\n\n- **Row 17:** Model \"bk - 4 mcc\" has a 90% capacity after 1 year and an 80% capacity after 3 years.\n  \n- **Row 19:** Model \"bk - 4lcc\" has a 90% capacity after 1 year and an 80% capacity after 3 years.\n\n- **Row 21:** Model \"bk - 4hcc\" has a 90% capacity after 1 year and an 80% capacity after 3 years.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll models with 90% capacity after one year also have 80% capacity after three years.
