    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to analyze the table data for driver Michael Schumacher, specifically focusing on his constructor (Ferrari), average grid number, and time/retired.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Michael Schumacher's Row:**\n   - From the table, in Row 1, it is stated that the driver is Michael Schumacher with the constructor Ferrari.\n   \n2. **Verify Time/Retired:**\n   - The time/retired for Michael Schumacher is given as \"1:32:35.101,\" which matches the claim.\n\n3. **Check Constructors of Interest:**\n   - We need to determine if Ferrari, as the constructor for Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello (Row 2), averages a grid number of 1.\n   \n4. **Extract Grid Numbers for Ferrari Drivers:**\n   - For Row 1 (Michael Schumacher): Grid = 1\n   - For Row 2 (Rubens Barrichello): Grid = 7\n\n5. **Calculate the Average Grid Number for Ferrari:**\n   - The average grid number is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average Grid} = \\frac{\\text{Grid of Michael Schumacher} + \\text{Grid of Rubens Barrichello}}{2}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average Grid} = \\frac{1 + 7}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4\n     \\]\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Michael Schumacher's constructor (Ferrari) has an average grid number of 1.\n   - From our calculation, the actual average grid number for Ferrari drivers is 4.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the calculated average grid number is 4 and not 1, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 1 (Michael Schumacher): Grid = 1\n- Row 2 (Rubens Barrichello): Grid = 7\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified Michael Schumacher's row and verified his time/retired matches the claim.
