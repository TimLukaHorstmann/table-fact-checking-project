    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Lee Janzen have 3 more top 25 finishes at The Open Championship than the Masters Tournament\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the relevant parts of the table concerning the top-25 finishes for both tournaments.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Data:**\n   - We are interested in the \"top - 25\" column for both the Masters Tournament and The Open Championship.\n   \n2. **Extract Top-25 Finishes for Each Tournament:**\n   - From Row 1 (Masters Tournament): \n     - \"Top - 25\" value is 3.\n   - From Row 3 (The Open Championship):\n     - \"Top - 25\" value is 4.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Top-25 Finishes:**\n   - The difference between top-25 finishes at The Open Championship and the Masters Tournament is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Difference} = \\text{Top - 25 (The Open Championship)} - \\text{Top - 25 (Masters Tournament)}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the values from the table:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Difference} = 4 - 3 = 1\n     \\]\n\n4. **Compare the Calculated Difference with the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that there are \"3 more top-25 finishes at The Open Championship than the Masters Tournament.\"\n   - Our calculation shows a difference of only 1.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the calculated difference (1) does not match the claimed difference (3), the statement is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim, we extracted the 'top - 25' values for both the Masters Tournament and The Open Championship. The Masters Tournament has 3 top-25 finishes, while The Open Championship has 4. Calculating the difference gives us 1 more finish at The Open Championship than at the Masters Tournament, which contradicts the claim of 3 more finishes.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"top - 25\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"top - 25\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
