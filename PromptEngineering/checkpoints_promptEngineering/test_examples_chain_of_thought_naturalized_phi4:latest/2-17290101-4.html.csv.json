    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to evaluate how many players are tied for each place based on the given table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states there were \"10 golfers tie for a place\" at the end of the 1959 US Open.\n\n2. **Analyze Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: Billy Casper is in 1st place with no ties.\n     - Place: 1\n     - Number of players: 1\n   - **Rows 2-4**: Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, and Ben Hogan are tied for 2nd place.\n     - Place: T2\n     - Number of players: 3\n   - **Rows 5-6**: Mike Souchak and Doug Ford are tied for 5th place.\n     - Place: T5\n     - Number of players: 2\n   - **Rows 7-8**: Ernie Vossler and Dow Finsterwald are tied for 7th place.\n     - Place: T7\n     - Number of players: 2\n   - **Rows 9-11**: Jay Hebert, Claude Harmon, and Gene Littler are tied for 9th place.\n     - Place: T9\n     - Number of players: 3\n\n3. **Count the Total Number of Players Tied**:\n   - From Rows 2 to 4 (T2): 3 players\n   - From Rows 5 to 6 (T5): 2 players\n   - From Rows 7 to 8 (T7): 2 players\n   - From Rows 9 to 11 (T9): 3 players\n\n4. **Calculate the Total**:\n   - Total number of tied players = 3 (T2) + 2 (T5) + 2 (T7) + 3 (T9) = 10 players\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The total number of golfers tied for a place is indeed 10, which matches the claim.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists golfers and their positions at the end of the tournament.
