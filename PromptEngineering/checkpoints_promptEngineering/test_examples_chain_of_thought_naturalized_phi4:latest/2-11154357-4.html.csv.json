Both West Germany and Austria have a total of 2 medals each, not 3.\n       2. They are indeed tied for the second-highest number of medals (since they both have 2), but the claim incorrectly states that they have 3 medals.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The first part of the claim about Italy is correct.\n   - The second part of the claim regarding West Germany and Austria having 3 medals is incorrect, as they each have only 2 medals.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim is FALSE because it inaccurately states the number of medals for West Germany and Austria.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The nation with the most medals is correctly identified as Italy with 3.
