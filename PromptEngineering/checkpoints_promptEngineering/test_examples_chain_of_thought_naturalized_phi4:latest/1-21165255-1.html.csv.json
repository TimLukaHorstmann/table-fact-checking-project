    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify if the production code `4300062` corresponds to a season number of 19 according to the table.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate Production Code**: Identify the row in which the production code `4300062` appears.\n   - According to Row 18: \n     - `production code`: 4300062\n\n2. **Determine Season Number for this Production Code**:\n   - In Row 18, we also find the column `no in season`, which is listed as 18.\n\n3. **Compare with Claimed Season Number**:\n   - The claim states that the number in season for production code `4300062` should be 19.\n   - From our check, the actual number in season is 18.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   - Since the actual season number (18) does not match the claimed season number (19), the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
