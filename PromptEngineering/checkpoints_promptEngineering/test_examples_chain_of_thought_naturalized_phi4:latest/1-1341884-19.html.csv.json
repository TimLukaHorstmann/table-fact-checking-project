This means that Eugene Siler\u2019s unopposed status does not relate to this election as it was contested.\n   - In Row 5, the description states \"retired democratic loss\" without specific candidate percentages. However, from Row 4's data, we know Frank Chelf won with 52.9%, implying Clyde Middleton lost.\n\n3. **Check for Republican Re-election in Kentucky 4:**\n   - A key part of the claim involves a re-elected Republican in Kentucky 4.\n   - In both relevant rows (Row 4 and Row 5), there is no mention of a Republican being elected or re-elected; Frank Chelf, a Democrat, was re-elected.\n\n4. **Compare the Conditions:**\n   - The claim suggests that Eugene Siler's unopposed election coincides with a Republican being re-elected in Kentucky 4.\n   - There are no instances where a Republican is re-elected in Kentucky 4, so there can be no coincidence with Eugene Siler\u2019s unopposed status.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is false because there was never an instance of a Republican being re-elected in the Kentucky 4 district during the elections described.
