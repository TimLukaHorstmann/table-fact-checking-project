We need to focus on entries where the region includes \"United States.\"\n\n2. **Examine Entries for the United States:**\n   - Look at rows that mention the United States as part of their region.\n\n3. **Review Dates and Formats in the United States:**\n   - Row 2: The entry lists \"region: united states uk,\" \"date: may 27, 2008,\" \"label: epic records,\" \"format: cd,\" and \"catalog: 706592.\"\n   - Row 3: This entry also mentions \"region: united states uk,\" with the same date \"may 27, 2008,\" but specifies \"format: paid download.\"\n\n4. **Determine First Release Date in the United States:**\n   - Both relevant rows (2 and 3) indicate a release date of May 27, 2008.\n\n5. **Conclusion Based on Analysis:**\n   - Since both entries for the United States have the same release date (May 27, 2008), there is no indication that this was not the first release in the United States.\n   - There are no other entries with an earlier date for the United States.\n\n6. **Final Decision:**\n   - Based on the information provided, May 27, 2008, appears to be the earliest release date for \"Bring Ya to the Brink\" in the United States, supporting the claim that it was the first release there.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 2: region, date, label, format\n- Row 3: region, date\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that 'Bring Ya to the Brink' was the first release in the United States.
