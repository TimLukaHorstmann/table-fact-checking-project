    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the only player with a total score of 141 is Jay Haas\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data related to players' scores.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: We need to focus on the column labeled \"score,\" which lists each player's total score for the event.\n\n2. **Locate Scores of 141**:\n   - Row 9: Player is Jay Haas with a score of 74 + 67 = 141.\n   - Row 10: Player is Davis Love III with a score of 70 + 71 = 141.\n   - Row 11: Player is Tom Watson with a score of 71 + 70 = 141.\n   - Row 12: Player is Mark Calcavecchia with a score of 74 + 67 = 141.\n\n3. **Count the Players**: From the identified rows, there are four players who have a total score of 141:\n   - Jay Haas\n   - Davis Love III\n   - Tom Watson\n   - Mark Calcavecchia\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**: The claim states that \"the only player with a total score of 141 is Jay Haas.\" However, we found four players with this score.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since there are multiple players (not just Jay Haas) with a score of 141, the claim is false.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows scores for each player.
