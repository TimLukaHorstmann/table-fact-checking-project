We will review each row where her name is mentioned.\n\n2. **Check the Surface Type for Each Match:**\n   - For each match involving Neuza Silva, we need to check if the surface was clay.\n\n3. **Count Matches on Clay Surface:**\n   - Count how many of these matches were played on a clay surface.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n- **Row 1:** \n  - Partnering with Angela Cardoso.\n  - Surface: Clay.\n  - Match on clay: Yes.\n\n- **Row 2:** \n  - Partnering with Ana Catarina Nogueira.\n  - Surface: Clay.\n  - Match on clay: Yes.\n\n- **Row 3:** \n  - Partnering with Frederica Piedade.\n  - Surface: Clay.\n  - Match on clay: Yes.\n\n- **Row 4:** \n  - Partnering with Ana Catarina Nogueira.\n  - Surface: Clay.\n  - Match on clay: Yes.\n\n- **Row 5:** \n  - Partnering with Ana Catarina Nogueira.\n  - Surface: Clay.\n  - Match on clay: Yes.\n\n- **Row 6:** \n  - Partnering with Ana Catarina Nogueira.\n  - Surface: Clay.\n  - Match on clay: Yes.\n\n- **Row 7:** \n  - Partnering with Ana Catarina Nogueira.\n  - Surface: Clay.\n  - Match on clay: Yes.\n\n- **Row 8:** \n  - Partnering with Ana Catarina Nogueira.\n  - Surface: Clay.\n  - Match on clay: Yes.\n\n- **Row 9:** \n  - Partnering with Frederica Piedade.\n  - Surface: Hard.\n  - Match on clay: No.\n\n- **Row 10:** \n  - Partnering with Frederica Piedade.\n  - Surface: Hard.\n  - Match on clay: No.\n\n- **Row 11:** \n  - Partnering with Michelle Larcher de Brito.\n  - Surface: Hard.\n  - Match on clay: No.\n\n- **Row 12:** \n  - Partnering with Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler.\n  - Surface: Hard.\n  - Match on clay: No.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nNeuza Silva competed in 9 matches listed, and out of these, she played on a clay surface in 8 matches (Rows 1 to 8).\n\nThe claim states that Neuza Silva competed on a clay surface in 9 matches.
