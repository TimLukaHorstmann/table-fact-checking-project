    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"2 drivers leave the race early because they have engine problem\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data focusing on the reasons for retirement related to engine problems.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**:\n   - We are interested in the columns: `driver`, `time / retired`, and specifically looking for \"engine\" as the reason for retirement.\n  \n2. **Scan Each Row for Engine Problems**:\n   - Check each row to see if the `time / retired` column mentions an engine problem.\n\n3. **List of Rows with Engine Problems**:\n   - Row 14: driver: riccardo patrese, time / retired: engine\n   - Row 19: driver: keke rosberg, laps: 41 (engine related as indicated by \"electrical\" which often implies a broader engine issue)\n   - Row 21: driver: philippe alliot, time / retired: engine\n   - Row 22: driver: philippe streiff, time / retired: engine\n   - Row 23: driver: martin brundle, time / retired: engine\n   - Row 26: driver: piercarlo ghinzani, time / retired: engine\n\n4. **Count the Number of Drivers with Engine Problems**:\n   - Riccardo Patrese (Row 14)\n   - Philippe Alliot (Row 21)\n   - Philippe Streiff (Row 22)\n   - Martin Brundle (Row 23)\n   - Piercarlo Ghinzani (Row 26)\n\n5. **Verification of \"Leave the Race Early\"**:\n   - The claim mentions drivers leaving early because of engine problems. Although \"early\" is subjective, all these retirements occurred before completing a significant portion of the race (70 laps).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - There are five instances where drivers retired due to engine problems, not two.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe claim that \"2 drivers leave the race early because they have engine problem\" is FALSE. \n\nHere's the JSON output with relevant cells listed:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We analyzed each row in the table for mentions of 'engine' as a reason for retirement and found five instances where drivers retired due to engine problems, not two as claimed.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"Ferrari be the constructor of 3 of the cars driven in the race\" is true or false, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column**: We need to check the \"constructor\" column for entries that match \"ferrari\".\n\n2. **Examine each row**:\n   - Row 5: Constructor is \"ferrari\".\n   - Row 6: Constructor is \"ferrari\".\n   - No other rows have \"ferrari\" as the constructor.\n\n3. **Count occurrences**: There are two instances where Ferrari is listed as the constructor (Rows 5 and 6).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The claim states that Ferrari was the constructor for 3 cars, but we found only 2 instances in the table.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The claim is FALSE because there are only 2 entries with Ferrari as the constructor, not 3.\n\nNow, let's format the final answer in JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Checked each row for 'ferrari' as the constructor.
