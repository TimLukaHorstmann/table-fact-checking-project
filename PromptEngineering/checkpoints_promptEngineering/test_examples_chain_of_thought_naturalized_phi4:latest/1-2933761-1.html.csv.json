    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, let's break it down step-by-step using the information provided in the table:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that \"multiple people be prison escapist and each leave the cube alive.\" This implies two conditions:\n   - There should be more than one person with the occupation \"prison escapist.\"\n   - Each of these individuals must have a status of \"alive after exiting the cube.\"\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - We need to check for any rows where the occupation is \"prison escapist.\"\n   - For each individual identified, we should verify their status.\n\n3. **Examine the Table**:\n   - Row 1: kazan has an occupation of autistic savant.\n   - Row 2: david worth's occupation is architect.\n   - Row 3: quentin is a police officer.\n   - Row 4: joan leaven is a mathematics student.\n   - Row 5: dr helen holloway is a free clinic doctor.\n   - **Row 6**: rennes has an occupation of prison escapist and status dead.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Conditions**:\n   - We find only one person with the occupation \"prison escapist,\" which is rennes in Row 6.\n   - Rennes' status is \"dead.\"\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - There is not more than one person with the occupation \"prison escapist.\"\n   - The single individual identified (rennes) did not leave the cube alive.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE because there is only one prison escapist and he is not alive after exiting the cube.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires multiple individuals with the occupation 'prison escapist' who are all alive after exiting the cube. Upon examining the table, only one individual (rennes) has this occupation and his status is 'dead.' Therefore, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"occupation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"status\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
