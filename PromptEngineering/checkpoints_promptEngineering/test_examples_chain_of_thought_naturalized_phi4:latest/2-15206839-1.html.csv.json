This matches with the claim that they have played 38 games.\n\n4. **Verify Drawn Matches:**\n   - In Row 20, under the \"drawn\" column, it states that Ipatinga has drawn 8 matches. This aligns with the claim's assertion that Ipatinga drew 8 games.\n\n5. **Check Lost Matches:**\n   - The same row shows that Ipatinga lost 21 matches.\n   - We need to determine if this number is more than 14, as stated in the claim.\n\n6. **Comparison Against Claim:**\n   - Since Ipatinga has lost 21 matches, and 21 is indeed greater than 14, this part of the claim holds true.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both conditions specified in the claim (\"drawn 8\" and \"lost more than 14 games\") are satisfied according to the table data for Ipatinga.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Ipatinga is listed in Row 20 of the table.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to verify each part of the claim using the data provided:\n\n1. **Team Name**: The claim mentions a team named \"ipitanga.\" We will look for this exact spelling in the 'team' column.\n2. **Points**: The claim states that \"ipitanga\" got 75 points. We will check if any row has this point total for the team \"ipitanga.\"\n3. **Games Played**: The claim mentions less than 30 games played. We will verify the 'played' column to see if it matches this condition.\n4. **Games Lost**: Lastly, the claim states that out of these games, 17 were lost. We need to check the 'lost' column for this number.\n\nNow let's go through the table:\n\n- In Row 20, we find a team named \"ipatinga\" with points equal to 35, not 75.\n- The played games for \"ipatinga\" are 38, which is more than 30. \n- Additionally, the lost games for \"ipatinga\" are 21.\n\nThe claim does not match any row in terms of team name, points, number of games played, or games lost.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is FALSE as there is no team named \"ipitanga\" with 75 points and having played less than 30 games, nor did they lose 17 games.
