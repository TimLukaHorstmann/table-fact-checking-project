    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"allen have the most point score on november 17 with 12 point\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row**: \n   - The claim refers to an event on November 17. According to the table, this corresponds to Row 2.\n\n2. **Examine the \"High Points\" for the Date**:\n   - In Row 2 (November 17), the \"high points\" entry is listed as \"allen - 12\". This indicates that Allen scored 12 points in that game.\n   \n3. **Verify if Allen has the Most Points on November 17**:\n   - The claim states that Allen had the most points with 12. Since the table specifies that Allen was the player with the highest points (12) for this game, there is no other player mentioned as having more points.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the information from Row 2, Allen indeed scored the most points in the game on November 17, which were 12 points.
