This does not match the claimed score.\n   - In row 16 (week 17), there is an entry against the San Diego Chargers with a result of W 17-12, which matches the claim in terms of score but does not correspond to \"game 17\" as per the week number.\n\n3. **Check Attendance Details:**\n   - The attendance for the game mentioned in row 16 (week 17) is 62,593, which matches the claim's stated attendance.\n   \n4. **Conclusion on Claim Validity:**\n   - Since there is no entry for \"game 17\" or \"week 17,\" and the details provided for week 17 do not match a non-existent game 17 in terms of opponent and result as per the weeks listed, the claim cannot be true based on the given table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table does not contain any entry labeled 'game 17' or 'week 17.'
