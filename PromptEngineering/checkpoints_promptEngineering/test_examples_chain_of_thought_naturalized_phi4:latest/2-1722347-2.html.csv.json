    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"each of the building that be currently under construction be at least 25 floor tall\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine each row in the table for buildings with a status of \"under construction\" and check their corresponding number of floors.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Status 'Under Construction':**\n   - We will look through the rows in the table and select those where the status is marked as \"under construction.\"\n\n2. **Check Floors for Each Building Under Construction:**\n   - For each identified building, we need to check if the number of floors is at least 25.\n\n3. **Evaluate Each Case:**\n\n   - **Row 9:** \n     - Building: 150 elgin\n     - Location: downtown\n     - Status: under construction\n     - Floors: 23\n     - Evaluation: The building has 23 floors, which is less than 25.\n   \n   - **Row 10:** \n     - Building: claridge plaza iii\n     - Location: sandy hill\n     - Status: under construction\n     - Floors: 28\n     - Evaluation: This building meets the requirement with 28 floors.\n\n   - **Row 12:** \n     - Building: claridge plaza iv\n     - Location: sandy hill\n     - Status: under construction\n     - Floors: 28\n     - Evaluation: This building also meets the requirement with 28 floors.\n   \n   - **Row 13:** \n     - Building: tribeca i\n     - Location: centretown\n     - Status: under construction\n     - Floors: 27\n     - Evaluation: This building has 27 floors, meeting the requirement.\n\n   - **Row 14:** \n     - Building: tribeca ii\n     - Location: centretown\n     - Status: under construction\n     - Floors: 27\n     - Evaluation: Similarly, this building meets the requirement with 27 floors.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Out of all buildings that are currently under construction, at least one (150 elgin) does not meet the requirement of having a minimum of 25 floors.\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - Row 9 (Floors: 23)\n   - Rows 10, 12, 13, and 14 have sufficient floors but are noted for completeness.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified buildings with 'under construction' status.
