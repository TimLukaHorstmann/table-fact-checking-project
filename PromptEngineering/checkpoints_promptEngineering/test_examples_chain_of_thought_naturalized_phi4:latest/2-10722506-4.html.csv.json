Instead, they all belong to the \"west\" region.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe claim is FALSE because none of the specified universities (University of Oklahoma, Rutgers University, University of Florida, and Duke University) are hosts in the \"midwest\" region according to the given table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that certain universities are midwest region hosts.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim about cities and states for the West region, we need to examine the given table and identify which rows correspond to the West region. We will then compare these entries with those listed in the claim.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Rows Corresponding to the West Region:**\n   - From the table, we note that the following rows are assigned to the \"west\" region:\n     - Row 13: University of Oklahoma, Lloyd Noble Center, Norman, Oklahoma.\n     - Row 14: Rutgers University, Louis Brown Athletic Center, Piscataway, New Jersey.\n     - Row 15: University of Florida, O'Connell Center, Gainesville, Florida.\n     - Row 16: Duke University, Cameron Indoor Stadium, Durham, North Carolina.\n\n2. **Extract City and State for the West Region from the Table:**\n   - From these rows:\n     - Row 13 lists \"city: norman, state: oklahoma\".\n     - Row 14 lists \"city: piscataway, state: new jersey\".\n     - Row 15 lists \"city: gainesville, state: florida\".\n     - Row 16 lists \"city: durham, state: north carolina\".\n\n3. **Analyze the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that for the West region, the cities and states are:\n     - Salt Lake City, Utah\n     - Ames, Iowa\n     - Nashville, Tennessee\n     - Notre Dame, Indiana\n\n4. **Compare Table Data with Claimed Cities and States for the West Region:**\n   - From step 2, we have four actual locations for the West region: Norman, Oklahoma; Piscataway, New Jersey; Gainesville, Florida; Durham, North Carolina.\n   - The claim mentions Salt Lake City (Utah), Ames (Iowa), Nashville (Tennessee), and Notre Dame (Indiana) as part of the West region.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - None of the cities or states listed in the claim match the actual cities and states identified for the West region from the table.\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identified rows corresponding to the 'west' region: Rows 13-16.\",\n    \"Extracted city and state information for these rows: Norman, Oklahoma; Piscataway, New Jersey; Gainesville, Florida; Durham, North Carolina.\",\n    \"Claim states Salt Lake City (Utah), Ames (Iowa), Nashville (Tennessee), Notre Dame (Indiana) are in the West region.\",\n    \"None of the claimed cities/states match those from the table for the 'west' region.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"state\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"state\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"state\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"state\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
