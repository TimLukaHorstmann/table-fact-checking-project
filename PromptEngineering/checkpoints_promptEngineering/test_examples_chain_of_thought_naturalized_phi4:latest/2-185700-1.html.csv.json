    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"vivo (ti scrivo) obtained higher points than croire\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table for the relevant rows and compare the points awarded to each song.\n\n1. **Identify the Row with \"vivo (ti scrivo)\"**:\n   - We look through the table to find where the song \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" appears.\n   - In Row 18, the song is listed as \"vivo (ti scrivo).\"\n\n2. **Extract Points for \"vivo (ti scrivo)\"**:\n   - From Row 18, we note that the points awarded to \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" are 52.\n\n3. **Identify the Row with \"croire\"**:\n   - We search the table again to find where the song \"croire\" is listed.\n   - In Row 17, the song is listed as \"croire.\"\n\n4. **Extract Points for \"croire\"**:\n   - From Row 17, we note that the points awarded to \"croire\" are 90.\n\n5. **Compare the Points**:\n   - We compare the points of both songs: \n     - \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" has 52 points.\n     - \"croire\" has 90 points.\n\n6. **Determine the Validity of the Claim**:\n   - Since 52 (points for \"vivo (ti scrivo)\") is less than 90 (points for \"croire\"), the claim that \"vivo (ti scrivo) obtained higher points than croire\" is false.\n\n7. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells are those containing the points for each song:\n     - For \"vivo (ti scrivo)\": Row 18, Column \"points\".\n     - For \"croire\": Row 17, Column \"points\".\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify and extract the points for 'vivo (ti scrivo)' from Row 18, which are 52. Next, find and extract the points for 'croire' from Row 17, which are 90. Compare the two point values: 52 is less than 90, so 'vivo (ti scrivo)' did not obtain higher points than 'croire'. Therefore, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
