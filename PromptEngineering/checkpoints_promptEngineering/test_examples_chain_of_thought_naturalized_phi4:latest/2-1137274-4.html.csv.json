This suggests that the episode might be named after its location.\n\n2. **Row 2 (Nantucket):**\n   - Title: Nantucket\n   - Production Code: AD1D01\n   - \"Nantucket\" is an island located off the coast of Massachusetts and is a known place name. The title likely reflects this location.\n\n3. **Row 3 (Salem):**\n   - Title: Salem\n   - Production Code: AD1D03\n   - \"Salem\" refers to several places, notably in Massachusetts. This aligns with the claim that the episode is named after its setting.\n\n4. **Row 4 (Jackson Hole):**\n   - Title: Jackson Hole\n   - Production Code: AD1D06\n   - \"Jackson Hole\" is a well-known valley located in Wyoming, making it likely that this title corresponds to the location.\n\n5. **Row 5 (Mount Rushmore):**\n   - Title: Mount Rushmore\n   - Production Code: AD1D07\n   - \"Mount Rushmore\" refers to a national memorial in South Dakota. The episode is probably set here.\n\n6. **Row 6 (Ashland):**\n   - Title: Ashland\n   - Production Code: AD1D05\n   - \"Ashland\" is the name of multiple towns and cities in the United States, so this fits with being named after a location.\n\n7. **Row 7 (Coos Bay):**\n   - Title: Coos Bay\n   - Production Code: AD1D04\n   - \"Coos Bay\" is located in Oregon. The title suggests it relates to this place.\n\n8. **Row 8 (South Beach):**\n   - Title: South Beach\n   - Production Code: AD1D09\n   - \"South Beach\" could refer to a region in Miami, Florida. This seems to match the claim.\n\n9. **Row 9 (Fort Lauderdale):**\n   - Title: Ft Lauderdale\n   - Production Code: AD1D10\n   - \"Ft Lauderdale\" is Fort Lauderdale, Florida, which confirms this title aligns with a location.\n\n10. **Row 10 (San Juan):**\n    - Title: San Juan\n    - Production Code: AD1D11\n    - \"San Juan\" is the capital of Puerto Rico and fits as a place-based name.\n\n11. **Row 11 (Antigua):**\n    - Title: Antigua\n    - Production Code: AD1D12\n    - \"Antigua\" refers to an island in the Caribbean, indicating it's named after its location.\n\n12. **Row 12 (New York City):**\n    - Title: New York City\n    - Production Code: AD1D08\n    - Clearly a major city in the United States, supporting the claim.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nUpon examining each row of data, all titles are indeed named after known locations, consistent with the claim. Therefore, the claim is true for every episode listed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Each title corresponds to a recognized location, either by direct name or implication.
