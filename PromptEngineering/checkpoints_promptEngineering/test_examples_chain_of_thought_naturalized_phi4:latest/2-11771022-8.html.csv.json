    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Vokoun was the decision in the first two games in March\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant parts of the table for the first two games played by Florida in March.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the First Two Games:**\n   - The first game listed in March is on March 2 (Row 1).\n   - The second game listed in March is on March 4 (Row 2).\n\n2. **Check the Decision Maker for Each Game:**\n   - **March 2 Game (Row 1):** \n     - Look at the \"decision\" column.\n     - The decision maker is listed as \"Anderson.\"\n   - **March 4 Game (Row 2):**\n     - Again, look at the \"decision\" column.\n     - The decision maker is also listed as \"Anderson.\"\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"Vokoun was the decision in the first two games in March.\"\n   - From our examination:\n     - In both the first and second games, the decision maker was \"Anderson,\" not \"Vokoun.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Vokoun was not the decision maker in either of the first two games, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 1, Column: \"decision\" (Value: Anderson)\n- Row 2, Column: \"decision\" (Value: Anderson)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The first two games in March are on March 2 and March 4.
