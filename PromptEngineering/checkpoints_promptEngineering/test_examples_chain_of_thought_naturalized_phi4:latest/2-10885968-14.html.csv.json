    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"north melbourne's away team score be 13.11 (89)\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify if North Melbourne had an away game on July 3, 1976, with a score of 13.11 (89). Here are the steps for evaluating this:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant row(s):** \n   - We look through each row in the table to find any mention of \"north melbourne\" as the away team.\n\n2. **Check Row 4:**\n   - According to Row 4, the home team is St Kilda and the away team is North Melbourne.\n   - The away team score for North Melbourne is listed as 13.11 (89).\n\n3. **Verify the conditions of the claim:**\n   - The table shows that on July 3, 1976, when North Melbourne was playing away against St Kilda at Moorabbin Oval, they scored 13.11 (89).\n   - This matches exactly with what is stated in the claim.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the conditions of the claim are satisfied by Row 4, where North Melbourne played as the away team and had a score of 13.11 (89), the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cell information:\n- The relevant cells come from Row 4 with column names \"away team\" and \"away team score.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows mentioning 'north melbourne' as an away team.\",\n    \"Row 4 lists North Melbourne as the away team against St Kilda.\",\n    \"The away team score for North Melbourne is recorded as 13.11 (89) in Row 4.\",\n    \"This matches the claim, confirming it to be TRUE.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
