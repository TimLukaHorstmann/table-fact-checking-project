To verify if the 1961 season was indeed the 65th season, we need to count from its inception.\n\n4. **Calculate the Season Number:**\n   - Starting from 1897 as the first season, the calculation is straightforward:\n     - 1897 (1st season)\n     - 1898 (2nd season)\n     - ...\n     - 1961 (65th season)\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - Counting each year from 1897 to 1961 inclusively gives us a total of 65 seasons.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The calculation confirms that the 1961 VFL season was indeed the 65th season of the league.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis, the claim is true.
