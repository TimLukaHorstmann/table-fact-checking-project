This means both Bob Gilder and Steven Richardson are tied for fifth place.\n\n4. **Verify Consistency in Scores and Money:**\n   - Both players have the same score of 283, which corresponds to being tied at that position.\n   - They also receive the same amount of money ($60,000), further confirming their tie.\n\n5. **Cross-Check with Other Tied Positions:**\n   - In the table, other ties are denoted similarly (e.g., \"t7\" for seventh place). This consistent notation supports the interpretation that \"t5\" indeed means a tie for fifth place.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the table data and the consistent use of the \"t5\" notation, it is clear that Bob Gilder and Steven Richardson are tied for fifth place.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 5: \n  - Column \"place\": \"t5\"\n  - Column \"player\": \"bob gilder\"\n  \n- Row 6:\n  - Column \"place\": \"t5\"\n  - Column \"player\": \"steven richardson\"\n\nBased on the analysis, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows that both Bob Gilder and Steven Richardson are listed with a 'place' of 't5', indicating they tie for fifth place.
