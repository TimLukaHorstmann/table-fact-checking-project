    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"sewda have the second lowest number of electorate in 2009\" is true or false, we need to analyze the number of electorates for each constituency mentioned in the table from 2009.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Constituency Electorate Counts:**\n   - Sewda (Constituency Number 20): 130,161\n   - Ater (Constituency Number 9): 177,334\n   - Bhind (Constituency Number 10): 197,183\n   - Lahar (Constituency Number 11): 205,839\n   - Mehgaon (Constituency Number 12): 210,649\n   - Godha (Constituency Number 13): 166,893\n   - Bhander (Constituency Number 21): 139,600\n   - Datia (Constituency Number 22): 143,593\n\n2. **List the Electorate Counts in Ascending Order:**\n   - Sewda: 130,161\n   - Godha: 166,893\n   - Bhander: 139,600\n   - Datia: 143,593\n   - Ater: 177,334\n   - Bhind: 197,183\n   - Lahar: 205,839\n   - Mehgaon: 210,649\n\n3. **Sort the Counts Properly:**\n   - Correct order in ascending:\n     1. Sewda: 130,161\n     2. Bhander: 139,600\n     3. Datia: 143,593\n     4. Godha: 166,893\n     5. Ater: 177,334\n     6. Bhind: 197,183\n     7. Lahar: 205,839\n     8.
