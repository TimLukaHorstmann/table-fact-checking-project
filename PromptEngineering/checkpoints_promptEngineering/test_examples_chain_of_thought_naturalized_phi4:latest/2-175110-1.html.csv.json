    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim regarding Rhodesia's medal count, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row**: The table lists nations ranked by their total medals. We need to find the row corresponding to \"Rhodesia\".\n\n2. **Locate Rhodesia in the Table**:\n   - From the table, we see that Row 5 corresponds to the nation \"rhodesia\" (note the lowercase format).\n\n3. **Extract Medal Counts for Rhodesia**:\n   - According to Row 5:\n     - Gold medals: 10\n     - Silver medals: 5\n     - Bronze medals: 2\n\n4. **Compare Extracted Data with Claim**:\n   - The claim states that \"Rhodesia have 2 bronze medal, 5 silver medal, and 10 gold medal\".\n   - Compare each part of the claim to the data extracted from Row 5:\n     - Gold: Claim says 10, Table shows 10 (matches)\n     - Silver: Claim says 5, Table shows 5 (matches)\n     - Bronze: Claim says 2, Table shows 2 (matches)\n\n5. **Determine Truth Value**:\n   - Since all parts of the claim match the data from Row 5 in the table, the claim is TRUE.\n\n6. **List Relevant Cells for Verification**:\n   - The relevant cells are those containing the medal counts for Rhodesia:\n     - Gold: Row 5, \"gold\"\n     - Silver: Row 5, \"silver\"\n     - Bronze: Row 5, \"bronze\"\n\nBased on this reasoning process, we can conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the row corresponding to Rhodesia in the table. This is found in Row 5. Extract the medal counts from this row for gold, silver, and bronze medals. Compare these extracted values with those mentioned in the claim: 10 gold, 5 silver, and 2 bronze. All parts of the claim match the data from the table, confirming that the claim is TRUE.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
