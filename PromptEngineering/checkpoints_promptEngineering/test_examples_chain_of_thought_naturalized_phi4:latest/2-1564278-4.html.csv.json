The notation \"a\" stands for \"advanced\" to at least the second round.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - Row 2 corresponds to the Australian Open.\n   - Row 3 corresponds to the French Open.\n   - Row 4 corresponds to Wimbledon.\n   - Row 5 corresponds to the US Open.\n\n2. **Check Entries for Year 2006:**\n   - **Australian Open (Row 2, Column 2006):** The entry is \"a\", meaning advanced to at least the second round.\n   - **French Open (Row 3, Column 2006):** The entry is \"q2\" (second round of qualifying), not \"a\".\n   - **Wimbledon (Row 4, Column 2006):** The entry is \"1r\", indicating first-round exit.\n   - **US Open (Row 5, Column 2006):** The entry is \"q1\" (first round of qualifying), not \"a\".\n\n3. **Check Entries for Year 2007:**\n   - **Australian Open (Row 2, Column 2007):** The entry is \"q1\" (first round of qualifying), not \"a\".\n   - **French Open (Row 3, Column 2007):** The entry is \"q2\", not \"a\".\n   - **Wimbledon (Row 4, Column 2007):** The entry is \"1r\", indicating first-round exit.\n   - **US Open (Row 5, Column 2007):** The entry is \"q1\", not \"a\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n- In 2006, only the Australian Open has an entry of \"a\".
