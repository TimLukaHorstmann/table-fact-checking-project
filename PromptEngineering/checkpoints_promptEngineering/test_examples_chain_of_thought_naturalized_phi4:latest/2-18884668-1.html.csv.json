Anastasia.\n\n3. **Verify Elevation Year:**\n   - In Row 5, under the column \"elevated,\" the year mentioned is \"circa 1116.\"\n   - The claim states that Bosone was elevated circa 1116, which aligns with this information from the table.\n\n4. **Confirm Elevator:**\n   - Although not explicitly required by the claim, for completeness, Row 5 indicates that Paschal II was the elevator.\n   - This is consistent with the context of other elevations mentioned in the table under Paschal II's leadership.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The information provided in Row 5 accurately reflects both aspects of the claim: Bosone's title as \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia\" and his elevation circa 1116.\n- Therefore, the claim is true based on the data from the table.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- From Row 5:\n  - Column \"elector\": \"bosone\"\n  - Column \"cardinalatial order and title\": \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia\"\n  - Column \"elevated\": \"circa 1116\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim about Bosone's cardinalatial order and title as 'cardinal - priest of s anastasia' and his elevation circa 1116 is verified by examining Row 5 of the table.
