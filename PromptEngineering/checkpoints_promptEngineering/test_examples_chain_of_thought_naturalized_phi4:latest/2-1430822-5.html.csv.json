Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim states that \"Lucas Di Grassi be first in barwa international campos team.\" This implies that Lucas Di Grassi should have been a season champion while being part of Barwa International Campos Team.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Information**:\n   - We need to find rows where Lucas Di Grassi is listed as the champion.\n   - Then, we must check if he was associated with \"Barwa International Campos Team\" in those instances.\n\n3. **Analyzing Each Row for Lucas Di Grassi's Championship**:\n   - **Row 1 (2005)**: Champion is Nico Rosberg (Art Grand Prix).\n   - **Row 2 (2006)**: Champion is Lewis Hamilton (Art Grand Prix).\n   - **Row 3 (2007)**: Champion is Timo Glock (ISport International).\n   - **Row 4 (2008)**: Champion is Giorgio Pantano (Racing Engineering).\n   - **Row 5 (2009)**: Champion is Nico H\u00fclkenberg (Art Grand Prix).\n   - **Row 6 (2010)**: Champion is Pastor Maldonado (Rapax).\n   - **Row 7 (2011)**: Champion is Romain Grosjean (DAMS).\n   - **Row 8 (2012)**: Champion is Davide Valsecchi (DAMS).\n   - **Row 9 (2013)**: Champion is Fabio Leimer (Racing Engineering).\n\n4. **Checking Lucas Di Grassi's Team Association**:\n   - In **Row 5**, Lucas Di Grassi is listed as third, with Fat Burner Racing Engineering.\n   - In **Row 8**, he is listed as third again, with no team specified in the third position column.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Lucas Di Grassi was never a champion (first place) in any season according to the table data.
