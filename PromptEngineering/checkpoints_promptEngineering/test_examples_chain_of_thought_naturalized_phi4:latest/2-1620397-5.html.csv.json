    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"3 episode of Doctor Who featuring a total of 3 characters\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze each relevant row in the table for episodes (series) and count the number of distinct characters featured across these episodes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Episodes**: We are looking at three specific episodes from the table:\n   - Row 2: \"hexagora\"\n   - Row 3: \"the children of seth\"\n   - Row 4: \"the guardians of prophecy\"\n\n2. **Count Characters in Each Episode**:\n   - **Row 2 (\"hexagora\")**: \n     - Featuring: tegan, nyssa\n     - Total distinct characters = 2\n\n   - **Row 3 (\"the children of seth\")**:\n     - Featuring: tegan, nyssa\n     - Total distinct characters = 2\n\n   - **Row 4 (\"the guardians of prophecy\")**:\n     - Featuring: peri\n     - Total distinct characters = 1\n\n3. **Aggregate Characters Across Episodes**:\n   - Combine all the characters from these three episodes:\n     - From Row 2 and Row 3: tegan, nyssa\n     - From Row 4: peri\n   - Distinct characters across all three episodes are: tegan, nyssa, peri\n\n4. **Total Count of Distinct Characters**:\n   - Total distinct characters = 3 (tegan, nyssa, peri)\n\n5. **Verify Claim**: The claim states that these three episodes feature a total of 3 characters.
