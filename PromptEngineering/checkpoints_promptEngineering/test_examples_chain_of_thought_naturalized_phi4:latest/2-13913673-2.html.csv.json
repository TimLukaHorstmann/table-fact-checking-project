    "resp": "To determine if the claim about attendance at a game against the Yankees on April 29 having the highest attendance at 41,872 is true or false, let's analyze the relevant parts of the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Games Against the Yankees:**\n   - The table lists games played from March to April.\n   - We need to identify all entries where the opponent is \"yankees.\"\n\n2. **Locate the Game on April 29:**\n   - According to the table, Row 28 corresponds to the game on April 29 against the Mariners, not Yankees.\n\n3. **Check Attendance for Games Against the Yankees:**\n   - Locate rows with \"opponent\" as \"yankees\":\n     - Row 24 (April 25)\n     - Row 25 (April 26)\n     - Row 26 (April 27)\n     - Row 27 (April 28)\n\n4. **Compare Attendance Figures for Games Against the Yankees:**\n   - April 25: Attendance is 31,467\n   - April 26: Attendance is 35,765\n   - April 27: Attendance is 31,598\n   - April 28: Attendance is 20,689\n\n5. **Identify Maximum Attendance for Games Against the Yankees:**\n   - The highest attendance among these games is on April 26 with 35,765 attendees.\n\n6. **Check Claimed Highest Attendance:**\n   - The claim states that the game against the Yankees on April 29 had an attendance of 41,872.\n   - However, there was no game against the Yankees on April 29; the highest recorded attendance for a game against the Yankees is 35,765.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim about the game on April 29 having the highest attendance at 41,872 is false because:\n     - There was no game against the Yankees on that date.\n     - No game in the table lists an attendance of 41,872 for a game against the Yankees.\n\nHere's the structured answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify all games played against the 'yankees' from the table.\",\n    \"Locate the entry corresponding to April 29 and check if it is against the 'yankees'.\",\n    \"Compare attendance figures for all games listed against the 'yankees'.\",\n    \"Determine the highest attendance figure among these games.\",\n    \"Verify the claim regarding the game on April 29 having an attendance of 41,872.\",\n    \"Conclude that the claim is false as there was no such game or attendance figure.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
