Therefore, look for rows with this date.\n   - Row 12 and Row 13 both have \"date: september 13\".\n\n2. **Check Opponent:**\n   - According to the claim, the opponent is \"atlanta.\"\n   - Both Row 12 and Row 13 list the opponent as \"atlanta,\" so these rows are relevant.\n\n3. **Examine Scores:**\n   - The claim states a score of \"9 - 7.\"\n   - In Row 12, the score listed is \"9 - 7.\"\n   - In Row 13, the score is \"7 - 1.\"\n\n4. **Verify Loss Pitcher and Record:**\n   - The claim specifies \"wright (14 - 7)\" as the losing pitcher.\n   - In Row 12, \"loss: wright (14 - 7)\" matches exactly with what's in the claim.\n\n5. **Cross-Check Attendance:**\n   - Though attendance is not part of the specific claim about the score and loss, checking it ensures complete verification:\n     - Row 12 has \"<1000\" for attendance.\n     - Row 13 has \"21476\" for attendance.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Row 12 matches all parts of the claim: date (September 13), opponent (atlanta), score (9 - 7), and loss pitcher with record (wright, 14 - 7).\n   - Therefore, the statement in the claim is consistent with Row 12.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant rows for September 13: Rows 12 and 13.\",\n    \"Both rows match the opponent as 'atlanta'.\",\n    \"Check scores: Row 12 has a score of '9 - 7', matching the claim; Row 13 does not.\",\n    \"Verify loss pitcher and record: Row 12 lists 'wright (14 - 7)' which matches the claim exactly.\",\n    \"The information in Row 12 confirms the claim is accurate.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"loss\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We need to find rows where \"loss\" is \"leiter\" and his record matches (9 - 7).\n\n#### Step 2: Check Records in Relevant Rows\n- **Row 4**: Loss is \"leiter (9 - 6)\".\n- **Row 15**: Loss is \"leiter (14 - 8)\".\n- **Row 21**: Loss is \"leiter (9 - 8)\".\n\nNone of these rows show Leiter with a record of (9 - 7). Therefore, there is no game where Leiter lost with the specified record.\n\n#### Step 3: Check Attendance\n- The claim states an attendance of 29,704. We need to find if any row matches this attendance number.\n  \n- **Row 15**: Attendance is 29,704.\n\nHowever, since Leiter did not lose in Row 15 (his loss was with a record of 14 - 8), the attendance does not match the conditions of the claim regarding Leiter's loss and record.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim states that Leiter lost a game with a record of (9 - 7) to an audience of 29,704.
