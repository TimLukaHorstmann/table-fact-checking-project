    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Bob Rule was the high point scorer more times than Walt Hazzard in the 1967-68 Seattle Supersonics season\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data for each game and count how many times Bob Rule and Walt Hazzard were the highest scorers.\n\n**Step-by-step Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:** We focus on the \"high points\" column which shows who was the high scorer in each game.\n\n2. **Count Occurrences for Bob Rule:**\n   - Row 2: Bob Rule (27)\n   - Row 10: Bob Rule (31)\n   - Row 12: Bob Rule (47)\n   - Row 13: Bob Rule (26)\n\n   Total occurrences for Bob Rule = 4\n\n3. **Count Occurrences for Walt Hazzard:**\n   - Row 3: Walt Hazzard (19)\n   - Row 5: Walt Hazzard (20)\n   - Row 6: Walt Hazzard (33)\n   - Row 7: Walt Hazzard (26)\n   - Row 9: Walt Hazzard (30)\n   - Row 14: Walt Hazzard (19)\n   - Row 15: Walt Hazzard (21)\n\n   Total occurrences for Walt Hazzard = 7\n\n4. **Compare Counts:** \n   - Bob Rule was the high point scorer 4 times.\n   - Walt Hazzard was the high point scorer 7 times.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since Walt Hazzard was the high point scorer more times than Bob Rule, the claim is false.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the 'high points' column to find who scored the most in each game.
