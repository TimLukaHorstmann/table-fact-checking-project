    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Manny Pacquiao's defenses from 1998 to 2009 is true or false, we need to analyze each row of the table related to his championship titles during that period. Specifically, we will calculate how many times he defended a title and compare it to the number of times he did not.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**:\n   - All rows from 1998 to 2009 are relevant: Row 1 to Row 8.\n\n2. **Extract Defense Information**:\n   - **Row 1**: 1 defense\n   - **Row 2**: 1 defense\n   - **Row 3**: 4 defenses\n   - **Row 4**: 2 defenses\n   - **Row 5**: 0 defenses\n   - **Row 6**: 0 defenses\n   - **Row 7**: 0 defenses\n   - **Row 8**: 0 defenses\n\n3. **Count Total Titles and Defenses**:\n   - Total number of titles won: 8 (one per row).\n   - Total defenses: 1 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 8 defenses.\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Times He Lacked Defense**:\n   - Titles with 0 defenses: Rows 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n   - Count of titles with no defenses: 4.\n\n5. **Determine Percentage of Titles Without Defenses**:\n   - Percentage = (Number of titles without defenses / Total number of titles) \u00d7 100\n   - Percentage = (4 / 8) \u00d7 100 = 50%\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Pacquiao lacked any defense 50% of the time.\n   - Our calculation shows exactly 50% of his title reigns had no defenses.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe analysis confirms that Manny Pacquiao lacked any defense 50% of the time from 1998 to 2009.

The result for these bouts is \"ko 8 / 12\" (Pacquiao won).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - There are no records of Manny Pacquiao losing by TKO in 1998.\n   - His first TKO victory occurred in 2001, not 1998.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there was no losing TKO bout for Manny Pacquiao in 1998, and his first TKO win was in 2001.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim, we identified all TKO fights from the table.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Manny Pacquiao having the biggest difference in score points during his bout with Marco Antonio Barrera is true or false, let's analyze each relevant row of the table based on the scoring results provided.\n\n1. **Identify the Bout Results**:\n   - We need to find the result format for each bout and calculate the score point differences.\n   - The table provides various outcomes such as \"ko\", \"tko\", and \"sd\" (split decision). Score point differences are typically relevant when a fight ends with points, which is indicated by \"sd\" or similar notations.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row for Relevant Results**:\n   - Row 1: Result is \"ko 8 / 12\". A knockout doesn't have score points since the bout ended before scores could be fully recorded.\n   - Row 2: Same as Row 1, result is \"ko 8 / 12\".\n   - Row 3: Result is \"tko 6 / 12\". A technical knockout stops the fight before all rounds are completed, but here it shows an official stoppage in round 6. We don't have full score details.\n   - **Row 4**: Result is \"tko 11 / 12\" against Marco Antonio Barrera. Again, this indicates a stoppage at round 11, not a points decision.\n   - Row 5: Result is \"sd 12 / 12\", indicating a split decision with full rounds fought. The \"sd\" suggests scores were close or differed among judges.\n   - Row 6: Same as Row 5, result is \"sd 12 / 12\".\n   - Row 7: Result is \"tko 9 / 12\". Similar to previous TKOs, it doesn't provide full score details.\n   - Row 8: Result is \"ko 2 / 12\", indicating a knockout in round 2.\n\n3. **Calculate Score Differences for Points Decisions**:\n   - Only Rows 5 and 6 have results involving points (\"sd 12 / 12\"). We need to determine if these rows show the largest score difference.\n   - Since \"sd\" means different judges had varying scores, we don't have exact point differences from this table. However, it indicates close scoring.\n\n4. **Compare with Other Rows**:\n   - None of the other rows provide a points decision (only KO or TKO), so no numerical score difference can be calculated from them.\n   - Therefore, the biggest score difference must come from one of the split decisions in Rows 5 or 6.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim specifically mentions Marco Antonio Barrera's fight (Row 4), which ended by TKO and not on points, so there is no score point difference available for this bout.\n   - Thus, Manny Pacquiao did not have the biggest score point difference in his bout with Marco Antonio Barrera.\n\nBased on these steps, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify result types: KO and TKO do not provide full scoring details; only SD results show points.\",\n    \"Examine each row for score decisions: Rows 5 and 6 have split decision (SD) outcomes, indicating score differences.\",\n    \"Compare with Marco Antonio Barrera's bout (Row 4): Result is a TKO, no score difference available.\",\n    \"Conclusion: The claim about the biggest score point difference during the Barrera fight is false as it was not decided by points.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
