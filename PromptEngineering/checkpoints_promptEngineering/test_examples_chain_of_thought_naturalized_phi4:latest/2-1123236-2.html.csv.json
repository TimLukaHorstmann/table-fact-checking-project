    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"more than 3 drivers have to retire because of a gearbox issue\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data for all instances where drivers retired due to a gearbox problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - The column that indicates the reason for retirement is \"time / retired.\"\n\n2. **Search for Gearbox Retirements:**\n   - We need to find rows where \"gearbox\" is mentioned in the \"time / retired\" column.\n\n3. **Count Gearbox Retirements:**\n   - Count how many times \"gearbox\" appears as a reason for retirement.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that more than 3 drivers retired due to gearbox issues. Therefore, we need at least 4 instances of gearbox-related retirements to consider the claim true.\n\n### Examination of Table:\n\n- **Row 18:** Bertrand Gachot, gearboxes is mentioned.\n- **Row 23:** Andrea Montermini, gearbox is mentioned.\n- **Row 24:** Jos Verstappen, gearbox is mentioned.\n\nThese are the only instances where \"gearbox\" appears in the \"time / retired\" column.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- There are exactly 3 drivers who retired due to a gearbox issue. The claim states \"more than 3,\" which implies at least 4.\n\nThus, the claim is false because there are not more than 3 retirees due to gearbox issues.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the column that indicates the reason for retirement ('time / retired').
