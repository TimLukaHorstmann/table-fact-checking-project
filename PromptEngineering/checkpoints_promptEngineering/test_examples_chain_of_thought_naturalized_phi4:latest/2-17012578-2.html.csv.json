    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, we need to analyze the information provided in the table and compare it to the statement in question.\n\n### Claim:\n\"Brendan Melnyk be lead and Ted Appelman be third / vice skip.\"\n\n### Steps for Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Brendan Melnyk's Role:**\n   - Look through the rows of the table to find where Brendan Melnyk is listed as a team member.\n   - In Row 10, Brendan Melnyk is identified as the \"lead\" in Ted Appelman's team.\n\n2. **Verify Ted Appelman's Roles:**\n   - Locate the row with Ted Appelman as the skip (team captain).\n   - In Row 10, Ted Appelman is listed as the \"skip.\"\n   - Check if Ted Appelman has any other roles:\n     - He is also mentioned as \"third\" in Row 10.\n\n3. **Check for Vice Skip Role:**\n   - Verify if Ted Appelman holds the position of \"vice skip\" anywhere.\n   - In Row 10, Ted Appelman does not have the role of \"vice skip\"; instead, his son Tom Appelman is listed as \"vice skip.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Brendan Melnyk is correctly identified as the \"lead\" in Ted Appelman's team (Row 10).\n- Ted Appelman is listed as \"third\" but not as \"vice skip\" for his own team.\n\nThe claim states that Ted Appelman is both \"third\" and \"vice skip,\" which is incorrect. Therefore, the statement is false because while Brendan Melnyk is indeed the lead, Ted Appelman is not the vice skip.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 10: \n  - \"skip\": Ted Appelman\n  - \"third\": Ted Appelman\n  - \"lead\": Brendan Melnyk\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Brendan Melnyk is identified as 'lead' in Row 10, where Ted Appelman is the skip.
