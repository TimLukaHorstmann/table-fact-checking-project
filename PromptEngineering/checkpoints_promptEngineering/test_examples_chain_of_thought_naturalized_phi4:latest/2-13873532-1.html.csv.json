    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"liu song's lowest ranking be in 2009 / 2010\" is true, we need to analyze the table for the relevant data points related to Liu Song's rankings across different years.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Data**: The first row of the table contains numerical values that likely represent rankings or scores. We will focus on these numbers for each year from 2004/05 through 2011/12.\n\n2. **Extract Rankings for Each Year**:\n   - 2004 / 05: 90\n   - 2005 / 06: 88\n   - 2006 / 07: 84\n   - 2007 / 08: 80\n   - 2008 / 09: 76\n   - 2009 / 10: 72\n   - 2010 / 11: 68\n   - 2011 / 12: 64\n\n3. **Determine the Lowest Ranking**: \n   - The lowest ranking corresponds to the highest numerical value in this context, as a higher number indicates a worse (lower) rank.\n   - From the extracted data, the highest value is 90 for the year 2004/05.\n\n4. **Compare with Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Liu Song's lowest ranking was in 2009/10, where the ranking is 72.\n   - However, the actual lowest ranking (highest numerical value) occurred in 2004/05 with a score of 90.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: \n   - Since the lowest ranking year according to the table is 2004/05 and not 2009/10, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant cells for this analysis are from Row 1 (numerical rankings) for each column corresponding to the years 2004/05 through 2011/12.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The first row contains numerical values representing Liu Song's rankings.\",\n    \"Extracted rankings: 2004/05: 90, 2005/06: 88, 2006/07: 84, 2007/08: 80, 2008/09: 76, 2009/10: 72, 2010/11: 68, 2011/12: 64.\",\n    \"The lowest ranking corresponds to the highest numerical value (90 for 2004/05).\",\n    \"The claim states the lowest was in 2009/10 with a ranking of 72.\",\n    \"Since 2004/05 has the worst ranking, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2004 / 05\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2005 / 06\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2006 / 07\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2007 / 08\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2008 / 09\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2009 / 10\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2010 / 11\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2011 / 12\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
