We will ensure that all rows in our analysis pertain to this competition.\n   \n2. **Locate the Venue**: The claim specifies \"the stoop\" as the venue. We need to find any row where the venue matches \"the stoop\".\n\n3. **Check the Score**: Once we have identified a row with the correct venue, we will verify if the score is indeed \"24 - 28\".\n\n4. **Verify the Result**: Although not required by the claim, checking the result (win or loss) can provide additional context to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Cross-Reference All Conditions**: Ensure that all conditions specified in the claim are met: competition, venue, and score.\n\n### Applying Steps to the Table:\n\n- **Row 22**:\n  - **Competition**: \"super league ii\" (matches the claim)\n  - **Venue**: \"the stoop\" (matches the claim)\n  - **Score**: \"24 - 28\" (matches the claim)\n\nThe conditions in Row 22 match all parts of the claim.
