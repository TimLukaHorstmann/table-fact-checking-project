Therefore, we need to verify which schools meet this criterion.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row for National Titles Count:**\n   - **Row 1 (Bellevue University):** 14 national titles\n   - **Row 2 (College of Saint Mary):** 0 national titles\n   - **Row 3 (Concordia University):** 1 national title\n   - **Row 4 (Doane College):** 10 national titles\n   - **Row 5 (Hastings College):** 3 national titles\n   - **Row 6 (Midland University):** 2 national titles\n   - **Row 7 (Nebraska Wesleyan University):** 19 national titles\n   - **Row 8 (Peru State College):** 2 national titles\n   - **Row 9 (York College):** 28 national titles\n\n3. **Identify Schools with More Than 20 National Titles:**\n   - From the data, only York College has more than 20 national titles (28 titles).\n   - Peru State College has only 2 national titles.\n\n4. **Compare Findings to Claim:**  \n   The claim states that both York College and Peru State College have won more than 20 times. However, according to our analysis:\n   - Only York College meets the criterion of having more than 20 national titles.\n   - Peru State College does not meet this criterion.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   Since the claim incorrectly includes Peru State College as a school with more than 20 national titles, it is false.\n\n**Final Answer in JSON Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.

Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Founding Years**: Look at the \"founded\" column for each college to extract their founding years.\n\n2. **Filter for 20th Century**: Identify which colleges were founded in the 20th century by checking if the year is 1900 or later.\n\n3. **Compare Founding Years**: Among those established in the 20th century, determine which has the earliest founding year.\n\n4. **Check Bellevue University's Year**: Verify Bellevue University\u2019s founding year and see if it matches the earliest 20th-century founding year identified.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- **Row 1 (Bellevue University)**: Founded in 1966.\n- **Row 2 (College of Saint Mary)**: Founded in 1923. This is a 20th-century college.\n- **Row 3 (Concordia University)**: Founded in 1894. Not in the 20th century.\n- **Row 4 (Doane College)**: Founded in 1872.
