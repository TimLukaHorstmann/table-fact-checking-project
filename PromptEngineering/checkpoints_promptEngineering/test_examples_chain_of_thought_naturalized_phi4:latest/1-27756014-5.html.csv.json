    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Brandon Jennings being the leader for high rebounds and points in 8 games during the 2010-11 Milwaukee Bucks season is true or false, we need to analyze each game listed in the table. We will focus on identifying the player with the highest points and rebounds for each game.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Game 1 (November 2)**\n   - High Points: Corey Maggette (16)\n   - High Rebounds: Andrew Bogut (9)\n   - Brandon Jennings is not the leader in either category.\n\n2. **Game 2 (November 3)**\n   - High Points: Andrew Bogut (21)\n   - High Rebounds: Andrew Bogut (13)\n   - Brandon Jennings is not the leader in either category.\n\n3. **Game 3 (November 5)**\n   - High Points: John Salmons (22)\n   - High Rebounds: Luc Mbah a Moute (15)\n   - Brandon Jennings is not the leader in either category.\n\n4. **Game 4 (November 6)**\n   - High Points: Andrew Bogut (19)\n   - High Rebounds: Andrew Bogut (14)\n   - Brandon Jennings is not the leader in either category.\n\n5. **Game 5 (November 9)**\n   - High Points: Brandon Jennings (19)\n   - High Rebounds: Ersan Ilyasova (9)\n   - Brandon Jennings leads only in points, not rebounds.\n\n6. **Game 6 (November 10)**\n   - High Points: Corey Maggette (20)\n   - High Rebounds: Drew Gooden and Ersan Ilyasova (10 each)\n   - Brandon Jennings is not the leader in either category.\n\n7. **Game 7 (November 13)**\n   - High Points: John Salmons (26)\n   - High Rebounds: Andrew Bogut (17)\n   - Brandon Jennings is not the leader in either category.\n\n8. **Game 8 (November 16)**\n   - High Points: Brandon Jennings (31)\n   - High Rebounds: Andrew Bogut (18)\n   - Brandon Jennings leads only in points, not rebounds.\n\n9. **Game 9 (November 19)**\n   - High Points: Corey Maggette (20)\n   - High Rebounds: Drew Gooden and John Salmons (8 each)\n   - Brandon Jennings is not the leader in either category.\n\n10. **Game 10 (November 20)**\n    - High Points: Brandon Jennings (25)\n    - High Rebounds: Drew Gooden (16)\n    - Brandon Jennings leads only in points, not rebounds.\n\n11. **Game 11 (November 24)**\n    - High Points: Keyon Dooling (18)\n    - High Rebounds: Drew Gooden and Luc Mbah a Moute (9 each)\n    - Brandon Jennings is not the leader in either category.\n\n12. **Game 12 (November 26)**\n    - High Points: Brandon Jennings (25)\n    - High Rebounds: Ersan Ilyasova (11)\n    - Brandon Jennings leads only in points, not rebounds.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBrandon Jennings was the leader for high points in games 5, 8, 10, and 12.
