    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"of the 12 team play, none of them score below 10 point\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine each row in the table for both the home and away teams' scores. The claim states that no team scored less than 10 points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Table Format**:\n   - Each row represents a match with two teams: a home team and an away team.\n   - Scores are given in the format \"X.YZ\" where X is goals, Y is behinds, and Z is additional points.\n\n2. **Convert Scores to Total Points**:\n   - The total score for each team can be calculated as `Total Points = (Goals * 6) + Behind + Additional Points`.\n   - A goal is worth 6 points, a behind is 1 point, and any additional points are added directly.\n\n3. **Evaluate Each Row**:\n\n   - **Row 1**: \n     - Geelong: 17 goals, 20 behinds, total = (17 * 6) + 20 = 122 points.\n     - North Melbourne: 12 goals, 8 behinds, total = (12 * 6) + 8 = 80 points.\n\n   - **Row 2**: \n     - Fitzroy: 13 goals, 13 behinds, total = (13 * 6) + 13 = 91 points.\n     - Melbourne: 12 goals, 13 behinds, total = (12 * 6) + 13 = 85 points.\n\n   - **Row 3**: \n     - South Melbourne: 14 goals, 19 behinds, total = (14 * 6) + 19 = 103 points.\n     - St Kilda: 13 goals, 11 behinds, total = (13 * 6) + 11 = 89 points.\n\n   - **Row 4**: \n     - Hawthorn: 13 goals, 13 behinds, total = (13 * 6) + 13 = 91 points.\n     - Footscray: 8 goals, 21 behinds, total = (8 * 6) + 21 = 69 points.\n\n   - **Row 5**: \n     - Richmond: 11 goals, 14 behinds, total = (11 * 6) + 14 = 80 points.\n     - Collingwood: 14 goals, 12 behinds, total = (14 * 6) + 12 = 96 points.\n\n   - **Row 6**: \n     - Essendon: 8 goals, 11 behinds, total = (8 * 6) + 11 = 59 points.\n     - Carlton: 17 goals, 16 behinds, total = (17 * 6) + 16 = 118 points.\n\n4. **Check for Scores Below 10 Points**:\n   - All calculated scores are above 10 points.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since none of the teams scored below 10 points in any match, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Converted each team's score to total points and verified that all scores were above 10 points.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
