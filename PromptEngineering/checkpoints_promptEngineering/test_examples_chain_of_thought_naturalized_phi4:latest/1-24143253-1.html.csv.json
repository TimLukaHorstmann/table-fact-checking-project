    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to examine each marriage mentioned within the dataset for its length and compare it to 71 years, which is stated as one of the shortest marriages.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Mona Graham and Karl Malden's Marriage:**\n   - Check if there are any entries in the data concerning a marriage involving \"Mona Graham\" or \"Karl Malden.\"\n\n2. **Verify Marriage Duration for Each Couple Mentioned:**\n   - For each couple listed, extract the length of their marriage from the dataset.\n\n3. **Compare with 71 Years:**\n   - Evaluate if any marriage in the dataset is shorter than 71 years.\n   - Specifically check if \"Mona Graham and Karl Malden\" have a recorded marriage duration of 71 years or less.\n\n4. **Determine Validity of Claim:**\n   - If no entries exist for Mona Graham and Karl Malden, then they cannot be considered in the context of having one of the shortest marriages.\n   - Confirm if any other couple has a shorter marriage than 71 years to validate or invalidate the claim.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- Upon reviewing the dataset provided, there are no entries for \"Mona Graham\" or \"Karl Malden.\"\n- Thus, we cannot find a record confirming their marriage duration, let alone one of 71 years.\n- Additionally, none of the marriages listed in the data mention a duration of exactly 71 years. The closest relevant durations mentioned in the dataset are:\n  - Catherine Scorsese and Charles Scorsese: 60 years (Row 35)\n  - Shirley Temple and Charles Alden Black: 55 years (Row 38)\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Since there is no mention of Mona Graham or Karl Malden, they cannot be considered in this context.\n- The claim that \"Mona Graham and Karl Malden have one of the shortest marriages at just 71 years\" is unsupported by the provided dataset.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The dataset does not list Mona Graham or Karl Malden, nor does it mention any marriage with a duration of exactly 71 years. Therefore, they cannot be considered in this context, and the claim about their marriage being one of the shortest at 71 years is unsupported.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
