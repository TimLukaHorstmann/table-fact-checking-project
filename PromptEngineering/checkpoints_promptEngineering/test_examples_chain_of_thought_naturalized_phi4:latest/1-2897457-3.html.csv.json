The positions listed for each player are: center, left wing, right wing, defence, goaltender, or a combination (e.g., left/right wing). Traditionally, these positions have been associated with male players, especially within the NHL context.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Review Each Row**: Examine the position of each player from pick 43 to pick 63.\n   - Row 1: Stephane Morin (Center)\n   - Row 2: Jason Zent (Left Wing)\n   - Row 3: Rob Zamuner (Left Wing)\n   - Row 4: Jason Cirone (Centre)\n   - Row 5: Scott Pellerin (Left Wing)\n   - Row 6: Bob Kellogg (Defence)\n   - Row 7: Louie Debrusk (Left Wing)\n   - Row 8: Veli-Pekka Kautonen (Defence)\n   - Row 9: Pierre Sevigny (Left Wing)\n   - Row 10: Blair Atcheynum (Right Wing)\n   - Row 11: Nicklas Lidstrom (Defence)\n   - Row 12: John Tanner (Goaltender)\n   - Row 13: Denny Felsner (Left Wing)\n   - Row 14: Scott Thomas (Right Wing)\n   - Row 15: Wes Walz (Centre)\n   - Row 16: John Brill (Left/Right Wing)\n   - Row 17: Jim Mathieson (Defence)\n   - Row 18: Murray Garbutt (Centre)\n   - Row 19: Jason Woolley (Defence)\n   - Row 20: Kris Draper (Defence)\n   - Row 21: Corey Lyons (Right Wing)\n\n2. **Assess Gender Association**: Each of these positions is traditionally associated with male players in the NHL, particularly during the time period referenced (1989).\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Since all listed positions are typically held by male players and there is no indication otherwise within the table or historical context that any of these players were female, it can be concluded that 100% of the players from picks 43 to 63 in 1989 were male.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Each player's position from picks 43 to 63 is traditionally associated with male players.

This assumption is based on the fact that professional men's ice hockey teams such as the NHL predominantly comprise male athletes.\n\n3. **Counting Total Players**:\n   - The total number of players from pick 43 to 63 is 21 (from the data provided in rows 1 to 21).\n\n4. **Determining Male Players**:\n   - Since there are no indications or exceptions noted about female players within this list, it's reasonable to conclude that all these players are male.\n\n5. **Calculating Percentage**:\n   - If all 21 players are male, the percentage of male players is \\( \\frac{21}{21} \\times 100\\% = 100\\%\\).\n\n6. **Comparing with Claim**:\n   - The claim states that 50% of the players should be male.\n   - Our calculation shows that 100% of the players are male.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since 100% is not equal to 50%, the claim that \"50% of the player draft 43 - 63 in 1989 be male\" is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists 21 players from pick 43 to 63.
