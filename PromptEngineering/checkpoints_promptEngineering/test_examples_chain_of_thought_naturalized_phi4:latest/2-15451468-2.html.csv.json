We will compare this value with the actual attendance data from the table for week 1.\n\n4. **Verify the Match:**\n   - If the attendance number in the table matches the claimed number, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\n### Execution of Steps:\n\n- **Step 1:** Identify Row\n  - From the provided table, \"Row 1\" corresponds to \"week: 1\".\n\n- **Step 2:** Locate Attendance Information\n  - In \"Row 1\", the attendance information is given as \"62936\" under the column \"attendance\".\n\n- **Step 3:** Compare Values\n  - The attendance listed in Row 1 for week 1 is indeed \"62936\".\n  - This matches exactly with the claim that states, \"the week 1 game have an attendance of 62936.\"\n\n- **Step 4:** Verify and Conclude\n  - Since both the table data and the claim provide the same attendance number, the claim is verified as true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on our step-by-step analysis, the claim about the attendance for the week 1 game is confirmed to be accurate.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified Row 1 for 'week: 1', located the attendance information in that row, compared it with the claimed value of 62936, and found a match.
