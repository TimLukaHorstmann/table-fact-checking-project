    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to verify two parts of it:\n\n1. The least attended game for the Washington Redskins during the 1953 season occurred on September 27, 1953.\n2. This particular game was against the Chicago Cardinals.\n\nLet's analyze these step-by-step using the data provided in the table:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n#### Step 1: Identify all attendance figures from the table\nWe need to examine each row of the table and note down the attendance figures:\n- Row 1 (September 27, 1953): Attendance = 16,055\n- Row 2 (October 2, 1953): Attendance = 19,099\n- Row 3 (October 11, 1953): Attendance = 26,241\n- Row 4 (October 18, 1953): Attendance = 33,963\n- Row 5 (October 25, 1953): Attendance = 34,031\n- Row 6 (November 1, 1953): Attendance = 47,845\n- Row 7 (November 8, 1953): Attendance = 19,654\n- Row 8 (November 15, 1953): Attendance = 21,392\n- Row 9 (November 22, 1953): Attendance = 16,887\n- Row 10 (November 29, 1953): Attendance = 17,026\n- Row 11 (December 6, 1953): Attendance = 21,579\n- Row 12 (December 13, 1953): Attendance = 22,057\n\n#### Step 2: Determine the least attended game\nFrom the attendance figures listed above, we identify that the smallest number is 16,055. This occurs on September 27, 1953.\n\n#### Step 3: Verify opponent for this date\nFor the game with an attendance of 16,055 (Row 1), the table lists the opponent as the Chicago Cardinals.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The claim specifies that the least attended game was on September 27, 1953. Our analysis confirms that this is correct.\n- It also claims the opponent for this game was the Chicago Cardinals. This matches with our findings from Row 1.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify all attendance figures from each row of the table.\",\n    \"Determine that the smallest attendance figure is 16,055 on September 27, 1953 (Row 1).\",\n    \"Verify that the opponent for this game was the Chicago Cardinals as listed in Row 1.\",\n    \"Both parts of the claim are supported by the data.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
