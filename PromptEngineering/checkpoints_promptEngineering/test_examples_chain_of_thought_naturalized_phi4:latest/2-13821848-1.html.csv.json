    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the boston celtic have a 2nd round draft pick in 1985\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table, we need to follow these logical steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that the Boston Celtics had a 2nd-round draft pick in 1985.\n\n2. **Examine the Table**: The table lists information about players selected in various rounds of a draft:\n   - Each row contains details such as round number, pick order, player name, nationality, and school/club team.\n   - We need to find any reference to a 2nd-round pick.\n\n3. **Identify Relevant Information**:\n   - Row 1: Round 1, Pick 20\n   - Row 2: Round 3, Pick 70\n   - Row 3: Round 4, Pick 93\n   - Row 4: Round 5, Pick 116\n   - Row 5: Round 6, Pick 139\n   - Row 6: Round 7, Pick 162\n\n4. **Analyze the Rounds**:\n   - The table does not mention a Round 2 pick at all.\n   - Without a Row indicating Round 2, there is no information about any team having a 2nd-round draft pick.\n\n5. **Conclusion Based on the Table**: Since there is no entry for a Round 2 pick in the table, we cannot confirm that the Boston Celtics or any other team had a 2nd-round draft pick in 1985 based solely on this data.\n\n6. **Final Assessment**:\n   - The claim specifically refers to the Boston Celtics having a 2nd round pick.\n   - There is no information provided about Round 2 picks, thus making it impossible to verify the claim with the given table.\n\nTherefore, the claim cannot be verified as true based on the available data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists draft picks for Rounds 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 but does not include any information about a Round 2 pick.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Andrew Battle be draft 80 pick before Chris Remly\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table provided:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Players:**\n   - The claim involves two players: Andrew Battle and Chris Remly.\n\n2. **Locate Information for Andrew Battle:**\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 2 corresponds to Andre Battle.\n     - Pick number for Andre Battle is 70 (Round 3, pick 70).\n\n3. **Locate Information for Chris Remly:**\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 6 corresponds to Chris Remly.\n     - Pick number for Chris Remly is 162 (Round 7, pick 162).\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"Andrew Battle be draft 80 pick before Chris Remly.\"\n   - Andre Battle was drafted with pick number 70, which is indeed less than 80.\n   - Since Chris Remly was drafted with pick number 162, and 70 (Andre Battle's pick) is less than 80 and also less than 162, Andre Battle was indeed drafted before Chris Remly.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is TRUE because Andre Battle (referred to as Andrew in the claim) was drafted with a pick number (70) that is both before pick 80 and before Chris Remly's draft position (162).\n\nHere are the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- Row 2, column \"pick\": 70 for Andre Battle\n- Row 6, column \"pick\": 162 for Chris Remly\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
