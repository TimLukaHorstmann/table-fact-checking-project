    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to assess earthquakes occurring before February 12, 1953, specifically focusing on their magnitudes. Here's how we can break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The statement says \"the magnitude of the earthquake before February 12, 1953 be 6.5\". This implies that every earthquake before this date should have a magnitude of 6.5.\n\n2. **Identify Earthquakes Before the Date**: We need to consider all earthquakes listed in the table with dates prior to February 12, 1953.\n\n3. **Check Magnitudes**:\n   - Row 19: January 23, 1909, magnitude 7.3.\n   - Row 18: May 25, 1923, magnitude 5.7.\n   - Row 17: May 1, 1929, magnitude 7.4.\n   - Row 16: May 6, 1930, magnitude 7.2.\n   - Row 15: August 5, 1947, magnitude 7.3.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**: The claim specifies that all earthquakes before February 12, 1953, must have a magnitude of exactly 6.5. However:\n   - Row 19 has a magnitude of 7.3.\n   - Row 18 has a magnitude of 5.7.\n   - Row 17 has a magnitude of 7.4.\n   - Row 16 has a magnitude of 7.2.\n   - Row 15 has a magnitude of 7.3.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since none of these earthquakes have a magnitude of exactly 6.5, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the structured output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim requires all earthquakes before February 12, 1953, to have a magnitude of exactly 6.5.\",\n    \"Listed earthquakes with their respective dates and magnitudes:\",\n    \"Row 19: January 23, 1909, magnitude 7.3\",\n    \"Row 18: May 25, 1923, magnitude 5.7\",\n    \"Row 17: May 1, 1929, magnitude 7.4\",\n    \"Row 16: May 6, 1930, magnitude 7.2\",\n    \"Row 15: August 5, 1947, magnitude 7.3\",\n    \"None of these earthquakes have a magnitude of exactly 6.5.\",\n    \"Thus, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"magnitude\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"magnitude\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"magnitude\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"magnitude\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"magnitude\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
