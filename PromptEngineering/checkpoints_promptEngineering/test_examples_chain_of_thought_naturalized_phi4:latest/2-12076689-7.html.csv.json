We need to find entries where the opponent is listed as \"tigers.\"\n\n2. **Count the Number of Games Against the Tigers**: Once we identify rows with \"tigers\" as the opponent, count how many such games occurred.\n\n3. **Check Dates for Consistency with 2006 Season**: Ensure these games fall within the dates specified in the table (September 1 to October 1), which are typical late-season dates in MLB, confirming they could be part of the 2006 season.\n\n4. **Verify the Team Name**: Confirm that \"tigers\" refers to the Detroit Tigers and not another team with a similar name.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n- **Step 1: Identify Relevant Opponents**\n  - Look for rows where the opponent is listed as \"tigers.\"\n\n- **Step 2: Count Games Against the Tigers**\n  - From the table:\n    - Row 12: Date September 14, Opponent: tigers\n    - Row 13: Date September 15, Opponent: tigers\n    - Row 14: Date September 16, Opponent: tigers\n    - Row 15: Date September 17, Opponent: tigers\n    - Row 25: Date September 29, Opponent: Tigers (note the capitalization difference)\n    - Row 26: Date September 30, Opponent: Tigers\n    - Row 27: Date October 1, Opponent: Tigers\n\n- **Step 3: Verify Dates**\n  - All these dates fall within the period covered by the table (September 1 to October 1).\n\n- **Step 4: Verify Team Name Consistency**\n  - The capitalization of \"Tigers\" in rows 25, 26, and 27 is consistent with how teams are typically referred to, confirming they are indeed games against the Detroit Tigers.\n\nBased on these steps, the Texas Rangers played the Detroit Tigers 5 times according to the table data.
