Therefore, we need to verify if any race occurred outside of May.\n3. **Check Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: Date is 5 February.\n   - **Row 2**: Date is 2 April.\n   - **Row 3**: Date is 15 April.\n   - **Row 4**: Date is 21 April.\n   - **Row 5**: Date is 5 May.\n   - **Row 6**: Date is 6 May.\n   - **Row 7**: Date is 24 June.\n   - **Row 8**: Date is 22 July.\n   - **Row 9**: Date is 26 August.\n   - **Row 10**: Date is 8 September.\n   - **Row 11**: Date is 14 October.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: From the above checks, we see that there are multiple races listed with dates in months other than May (February, April, June, July, August, September, and October).\n\n5. **Determine Claim Validity**: Since not all races were held in May, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 1: Date - \"5 February\"\n- Row 2: Date - \"2 April\"\n- Row 3: Date - \"15 April\"\n- Row 4: Date - \"21 April\"\n- Row 7: Date - \"24 June\"\n- Row 8: Date - \"22 July\"\n- Row 9: Date - \"26 August\"\n- Row 10: Date - \"8 September\"\n- Row 11: Date - \"14 October\"\n\nThese cells demonstrate that races occurred outside of May, disproving the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim, we checked each race's date in the table.
