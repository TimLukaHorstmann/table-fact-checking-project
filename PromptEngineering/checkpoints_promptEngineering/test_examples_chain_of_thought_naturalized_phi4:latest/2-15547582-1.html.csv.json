    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, let's break down the claim into its components and check them against the data provided.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n\n1. **Industrial and Commercial Panel > 1**: We need to identify rows where the \"industrial and commercial panel\" value is greater than 1.\n2. **Labour Panel > 1**: For these identified rows, we then verify if the \"labour panel\" value is also greater than 1.\n3. **Nominated by the Taoiseach \u2264 11**: We check whether the \"nominated by the taoiseach\" value in these rows is less than or equal to 11.\n4. **Cultural and Educational Panel < 0**: Finally, we verify if the \"cultural and educational panel\" value is smaller than 0.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Industrial and Commercial Panel > 1**:\n   - From the table: \n     - Fianna F\u00e1il (Row 1) has 3.\n     - Fine Gael (Row 2) has 1.\n     - Labour Party (Row 3) has 0.\n     - Clann na Talmhan (Row 4) has 0.\n     - Clann na Poblachta (Row 5) has 0.\n     - Independent (Row 6) has 3.\n     - Total (Row 7) is just a sum row.\n\n   Relevant rows for this condition are Row 1 and Row 6.\n\n2. **Check Labour Panel > 1 in These Rows**:\n   - Fianna F\u00e1il (Row 1): Labour panel = 2, which satisfies the condition.\n   - Independent (Row 6): Labour panel = 2, which also satisfies the condition.\n\n3. **Verify Nominated by the Taoiseach \u2264 11 in These Rows**:\n   - Fianna F\u00e1il (Row 1): Nominated by the taoiseach = 9, which is \u2264 11.\n   - Independent (Row 6): Nominated by the taoiseach = 0, which is also \u2264 11.\n\n4. **Check Cultural and Educational Panel < 0 in These Rows**:\n   - Fianna F\u00e1il (Row 1): Cultural and educational panel = 3, not < 0.\n   - Independent (Row 6): Cultural and educational panel = 0, not < 0.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nFor both rows that meet the first two conditions (Fianna F\u00e1il and Independent), the \"cultural and educational panel\" does not satisfy the condition of being less than 0. Therefore, there are no rows where all conditions in the claim are simultaneously true.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE because it correctly states that there are no such panels meeting all specified conditions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows with Industrial and Commercial Panel > 1: Fianna F\u00e1il (Row 1) and Independent (Row 6).\",\n    \"Check Labour Panel > 1 in these rows: Both satisfy this condition.\",\n    \"Verify Nominated by the Taoiseach \u2264 11 in these rows: Both satisfy this condition.\",\n    \"Check Cultural and Educational Panel < 0 in these rows: Neither satisfies this condition.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"industrial and commercial panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"industrial and commercial panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"labour panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"labour panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominated by the taoiseach\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"nominated by the taoiseach\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"cultural and educational panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"cultural and educational panel\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
