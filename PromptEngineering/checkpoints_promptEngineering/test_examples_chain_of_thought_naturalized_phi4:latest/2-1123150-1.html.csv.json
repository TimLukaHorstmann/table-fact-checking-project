    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"there be 36 driver attempt to compete in the 1992 Australian Grand Prix\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table provided:\n\n1. **Understanding the Table**: The table lists information about drivers who participated in a race, including their names, constructors, number of laps completed, reasons for retirement (if applicable), and their starting grid positions.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Information**: We are interested in finding out how many driver attempts there were to compete in the race. This corresponds to counting the total number of entries in the table because each row represents a unique attempt by a driver to complete the race.\n\n3. **Counting Rows**:\n   - The table consists of 26 rows, each representing a different driver's attempt to compete.\n   - Row indices range from 1 to 26.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since there are only 26 entries in the table, this indicates that there were 26 attempts by drivers to compete in the race.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**: The claim states there were 36 driver attempts. Comparing this with our count of 26 from the table, we can see that the claim is incorrect.\n\n6. **Final Answer**:\n   - The claim is false because there are only 26 driver attempts listed in the table, not 36.\n\nHere's the JSON object summarizing the reasoning and conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists each driver attempt to compete as a row.
