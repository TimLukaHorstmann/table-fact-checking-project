Verify Origin:\n- Look at Row 16 for information about Joseph Barksdale.\n- The relevant data provided are: position (OT), height (6'4\"), weight (325 lbs), birth date and place, college (LSU), and draft details.\n- **Missing Information**: The high school attended by Joseph Barksdale is not mentioned in the table. Therefore, we cannot confirm that he attended \"Ca Technical High School\" from the given data.\n\n#### 2. Determine Heaviest Player:\n- Compare the weights of all players listed to see if Joseph Barksdale has the highest weight.\n- **Weights Listed**:\n  - Row 1: Walter Clago - 195 lbs\n  - Row 2: Darris McCord - 250 lbs\n  - Row 3: Ben John Paolucci - 240 lbs\n  - Row 4: Arnie Simkus - 245 lbs\n  - Row 5: David Boone Jr. - 248 lbs\n  - Row 6: Aaron Kyle - 185 lbs\n  - Row 7: Tom Seabron - 215 lbs\n  - Row 8: Harlan Huckleby - 200 lbs\n  - Row 9: Curtis Greer - 256 lbs\n  - Row 10: Guy Frazier - 217 lbs\n  - Row 11: Thomas Sidney Sims - 288 lbs\n  - Row 12: Pat Ivey - 255 lbs\n  - Row 13: AJ Ofodile - 260 lbs\n  - Row 14: Clarence Williams - 193 lbs\n  - Row 15: Vernon Gholston - 264 lbs\n  - **Row 16**: Joseph Barksdale - 325 lbs (currently highest)\n  - Row 17: Will Campbell - 311 lbs\n\n- From this comparison, Joseph Barksdale's weight of 325 lbs is indeed the highest among all players listed.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- While we can confirm that Joseph Barksdale is the heaviest player based on the weights provided, we cannot verify his high school as \"Ca Technical High School\" because it is not included in the table.\n- Therefore, due to insufficient information about his high school attendance, we cannot definitively state the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to identify how many players from the table attended Michigan College (University of Michigan) and verify if Will Campbell and Arnie Simkus are among them.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Players Who Attended Michigan:**\n   - We will scan through each row in the table to find entries where the \"college\" column mentions \"michigan.\"\n\n2. **Check Each Row for \"Michigan\" College:**\n   - **Row 4**: Arnie Simkus attended Michigan.\n   - **Row 7**: Tom Seabron attended Michigan.\n   - **Row 8**: Harlan Huckleby attended Michigan.\n   - **Row 10**: Guy Frazier attended Wyoming, not Michigan.\n   - **Row 12**: Pat Ivey attended Mizzou, not Michigan.\n   - **Row 13**: A.J. Ofodile attended Mizzou, not Michigan.\n   - **Row 14**: Clarence Williams attended Michigan.\n   - **Row 17**: Will Campbell attended Michigan.\n\n3. **Count the Number of Players from Michigan:**\n   - From the above checks, we have identified five players who attended Michigan:\n     - Arnie Simkus\n     - Tom Seabron\n     - Harlan Huckleby\n     - Clarence Williams\n     - Will Campbell\n\n4. **Verify if Will Campbell and Arnie Simkus are Among Them:**\n   - Both Will Campbell and Arnie Simkus are indeed among the five players who attended Michigan.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Will Campbell and Arnie Simkus be 2 of 6 students from Michigan College.\n   - We found only 5 players, not 6, from Michigan in the table.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false because there are only 5 players who attended Michigan, not 6 as stated in the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We identified players who attended Michigan by checking each row for 'michigan' in the college column.
