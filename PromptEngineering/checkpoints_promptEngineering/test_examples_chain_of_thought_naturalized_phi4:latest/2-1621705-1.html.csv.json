Here's how I approached the problem:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Pollutant and Standards:**\n   - The claim specifically refers to SO2 (sulfur dioxide).\n   - We need to find all rows where the pollutant is SO2.\n\n2. **Check Averaging Time for Each Standard:**\n   - The claim mentions a 1-hour time period, so we will focus on the standards that correspond to this averaging time for any pollutants.\n\n3. **Locate Relevant Entries in the Table:**\n   - Check each row where \"pollutant\" is SO2.\n     - Row 1: Averaging time is 24-hour.\n     - Row 2: Averaging time is annual.\n     - Row 3: Averaging time is 3-hour.\n\n4. **Check All Other Pollutants for a 1-Hour Standard:**\n   - Look at all rows to find any standards with an averaging time of 1 hour and compare their values, particularly checking if any exceed the standard mentioned in the claim (35 ppm).\n\n5. **Review Non-SO2 Entries for 1-Hour Standards:**\n   - Row 7: CO has a primary standard of 35 ppm for a 1-hour period.\n   - No other pollutants have standards listed with a 1-hour averaging time that exceed or are relevant to the claim.\n\n6. **Conclusion Based on Analysis:**\n   - SO2 does not have any allowable standard at 35 ppm or higher for a 1-hour time period according to the table.\n   - The highest standard for SO2, based on the entries provided, is 0.14 ppm for a 24-hour averaging time (Row 1), which is far below 35 ppm.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim \"SO2 have the highest allowable standard at 35ppm for a 1-hour time\" is FALSE.
