    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"mina gerais play 15 and lost 9\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the data for the team \"minas gerais\" in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - The claim pertains to the team \"minas gerais\". We need to locate this team in the provided table.\n   - By examining each row, we find that \"minas gerais\" is listed in Row 8.\n\n2. **Verify the Number of Games Played:**\n   - In Row 8, the column labeled \"played\" shows the number of games played by \"minas gerais\".\n   - According to the table, \"minas gerais\" has a value of 15 for the \"played\" column.\n   - This matches the first part of the claim.\n\n3. **Verify the Number of Games Lost:**\n   - In Row 8, the column labeled \"lost\" shows the number of games lost by \"minas gerais\".\n   - According to the table, \"minas gerais\" has a value of 9 for the \"lost\" column.\n   - This matches the second part of the claim.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both parts of the claim are consistent with the data in Row 8 for \"minas gerais\".\n   - Therefore, the entire claim is TRUE based on the information provided in the table.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cells that confirm the claim are:\n  - `{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"played\"}`\n  - `{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate 'minas gerais' in Row 8.
