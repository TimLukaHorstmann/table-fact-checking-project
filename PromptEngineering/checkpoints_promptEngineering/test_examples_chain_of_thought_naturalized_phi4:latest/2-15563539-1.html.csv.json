Smith\n  - Workers Ticket: James P. Cannon\n\nIn Row 1, we see that Alfred E. Smith is on the Democratic ticket for the office of Governor and James P. Cannon is on the Workers ticket for the same office.\n\n- **Row 2 to Row 7:**\n  - For each row beyond Row 1, verify if both conditions hold (i.e., if both Alfred E. Smith appears on a Democratic ticket and James P. Cannon appears on a Workers ticket for any other office):\n    - Row 2: George R. Lunn (Democrat) and Franklin P.
