    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Italy having 0 gold medals and more than 1 silver medal is true or false, we will analyze the relevant data from the table:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row**: \n   - We need to find the row corresponding to Italy in the table.\n\n2. **Locate Italy's Data**:\n   - From the table, Italy is listed in Row 6 with the following details:\n     - Rank: 6\n     - Nation: Italy\n     - Gold: 0\n     - Silver: 3\n     - Bronze: 0\n     - Total: 3\n\n3. **Verify Gold Medal Count**:\n   - According to Row 6, Italy has \"gold: 0\". This confirms the part of the claim that Italy has 0 gold medals.\n\n4. **Verify Silver Medal Count**:\n   - The same row indicates \"silver: 3\", which means Italy has more than 1 silver medal.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Both conditions in the claim are satisfied: Italy indeed has 0 gold medals and more than 1 silver medal.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe claim is true based on the data from Row 6 of the table.
