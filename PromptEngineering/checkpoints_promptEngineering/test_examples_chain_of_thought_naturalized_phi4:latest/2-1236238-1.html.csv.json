A finish position within the top 10 means a value from 1 to 10 inclusive.\n   \n3. **Examine Each Year:**\n\n   - **1953:** The 'finish' is 27, which is not in the top 10.\n   - **1954:** The 'finish' is 7, which is within the top 10.\n   - **1955:** The 'finish' is 15, which is not in the top 10.\n   - **1956:** The 'finish' is 3, which is within the top 10.\n   - **1957:** The 'finish' is 17, which is not in the top 10.\n   - **1958:** The 'finish' is 7, which is within the top 10.\n   - **1959:** The 'finish' is 22, which is not in the top 10.\n   - **1960:** The 'finish' is 22, which is not in the top 10.\n\n4. **Count the Top 10 Finishes:**\n   - From the analysis above, Don Freeland finished in the top 10 for the years 1954, 1956, and 1958.\n   - This totals to 3 times, not 5 times as claimed.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that Don Freeland finished in the top 10 a total of 5 times. However, based on our analysis, he only finished in the top 10 three times.\n\n- **Relevant Cells:**\n  - Row 2, 'finish': 7\n  - Row 4, 'finish': 3\n  - Row 6, 'finish': 7\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Don Freeland finished in the top 10 a total of 5 times.
