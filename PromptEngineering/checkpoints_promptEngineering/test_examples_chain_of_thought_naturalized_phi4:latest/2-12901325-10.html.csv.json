    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, let's break down the information given in the table and analyze it step-by-step.\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that \"the only non-pitcher to be drafted was the last player.\"\n\n2. **Identify Pitchers and Non-Pitchers**:\n   - A pitcher is typically an individual playing a position such as rhp (right-handed pitcher), lhp (left-handed pitcher).\n   - Non-pitchers are players in positions other than rhp or lhp.\n\n3. **Analyze Each Row for Position**:\n   - **Row 1**: Name: Pat Harrison, Position: Inf (Infielder) - This is a non-pitcher.\n   - **Row 2**: Name: William Camp, Position: RHP (Right-handed Pitcher) - This is a pitcher.\n   - **Row 3**: Name: George Pugh, Position: LHP (Left-handed Pitcher) - This is a pitcher.\n   - **Row 4**: Name: William Ferguson, Position: 1B (First Baseman) - This is a non-pitcher.\n   - **Row 5**: Name: George Putz, Position: 1B (First Baseman) - This is a non-pitcher.\n\n4. **Identify the Last Player**:\n   - The last player in the table is Row 5: George Putz, who plays at 1B.\n\n5. **Check if the Last Player is the Only Non-Pitcher Drafted**:\n   - From our analysis, there are three non-pitchers: Pat Harrison (Row 1), William Ferguson (Row 4), and George Putz (Row 5).\n   - The claim states that the only non-pitcher drafted was the last player. However, we identified two other non-pitchers before the last player.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there are multiple non-pitchers in the draft and not just the last one, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's format the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that the only non-pitcher drafted was the last player. By analyzing each row, we identified three non-pitchers: Pat Harrison (Row 1), William Ferguson (Row 4), and George Putz (Row 5).
