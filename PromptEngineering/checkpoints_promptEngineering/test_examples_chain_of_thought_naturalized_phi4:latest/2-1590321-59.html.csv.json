    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"during the year of 1950 through 1965, the goal score be less than 160\" is true or false, we need to examine the table for players who played during the specified years (1950 - 1965) and check their goal scores. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Time Frame:** The claim concerns the period from 1950 through 1965.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row for Overlapping Years:**\n   - Check each player's active years to see if they overlap with or fall within 1950 - 1965.\n   \n3. **Evaluate Goal Scores:**\n   - For players whose playing years include any part of 1950 - 1965, check their total goals scored.\n\n4. **Relevant Players and Their Data:**\n   - **Row 9:** Mihai Adam (years: 1962 - 1976) has a goal score of 160.\n     - His active period overlaps with the specified years (1962 to 1965).\n   - **Row 10:** Titus Ozon (years: 1947 - 1964) has a goal score of 157.\n     - His playing years also overlap with the specified time frame.\n\n5. **Conclusion from Data:**\n   - Mihai Adam scored exactly 160 goals, which does not satisfy the condition \"less than 160.\"\n   - Titus Ozon scored 157 goals, which satisfies the condition.\n\n6. **Assess the Claim:**\n   - Since there is at least one player (Mihai Adam) with a goal score of exactly 160 during this period, the statement that all goal scores should be less than 160 is false.\n\n7. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - Row 9, Column \"years\" and \"goals\" for Mihai Adam.\n   - Row 10, Column \"years\" and \"goals\" for Titus Ozon.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was examined to identify players active during 1950-1965.
