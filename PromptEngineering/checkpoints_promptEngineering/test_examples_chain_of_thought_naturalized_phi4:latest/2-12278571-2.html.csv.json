Whether there is an entry with a finish of \"t12\" that has the highest total score.\n2. Whether this entry corresponds to a player from South Africa.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Entries with a \"t12\" Finish\nFrom the table, let's identify all entries with a \"finish\" of \"t12\":\n- Row 3: Player: Tiger Woods, Country: United States, Year(s) Won: 2000, 2005, 2006, Total: 282, To Par: -2, Finish: t12\n\n### Step 3: Check the Total Score for \"t12\" Finish\nFor the entry identified in Step 2:\n- The total score is 282.\n\n### Step 4: Verify if This is the Highest Total for a \"t12\" Finish\nSince there is only one entry with a \"t12\" finish, its total of 282 is indeed the highest (and only) total for that finish.\n\n### Step 5: Check the Country for the Entry\nFor the entry in Row 3:\n- The country is United States, not South Africa.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim states that the player with a \"t12\" finish and the highest total of 282.0 should be from South Africa.
