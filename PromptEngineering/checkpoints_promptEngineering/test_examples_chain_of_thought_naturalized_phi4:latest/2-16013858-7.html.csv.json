These scores indicate a match decided by three sets.\n   - Additionally, verify that columns `set 4` and `set 5` are empty (or not applicable), which confirms no additional sets were played.\n\n3. **Count the Matches:**\n   - Count all matches with the score \"3 - 0\" or \"0 - 3\" and ensure they have no entries in `set 4` and `set 5`.\n\n4. **List Relevant Rows:**\n   - Record rows where these conditions are met.\n\n### Evaluation of Each Row:\n\n- **Row 1:** Score is \"3 - 0\", sets 4 and 5 are empty.\n- **Row 2:** Score is \"0 - 3\", sets 4 and 5 are empty.\n- **Row 4:** Score is \"3 - 0\", sets 4 and 5 are empty.\n- **Row 6:** Score is \"3 - 0\", sets 4 and 5 are empty.\n- **Row 8:** Score is \"3 - 0\", sets 4 and 5 are empty.\n- **Row 11:** Score is \"3 - 0\", sets 4 and 5 are empty.\n- **Row 12:** Score is \"0 - 3\", sets 4 and 5 are empty.\n- **Row 16:** Score is \"3 - 0\", sets 4 and 5 are empty.\n- **Row 20:** Score is \"3 - 0\", sets 4 and 5 are empty.\n- **Row 24:** Score is \"3 - 0\", sets 4 and 5 are empty.\n\nCounting these, we find there are 10 matches that meet the criteria of being decided in only three sets.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states there were 14 such matches.

The score '3 - 0' appears 8 times. Other scores are counted as follows: '3 - 1' (6 times), '3 - 2' (1 time), '0 - 3' (4 times), and '1 - 3' (3 times). Combine the frequencies of all scores except '3 - 0' and '1 - 3', which totals to 11. Since 8 is not greater than 11, the claim that '3 - 0' occurs more often than all other scores combined except '1 - 3' is FALSE.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
