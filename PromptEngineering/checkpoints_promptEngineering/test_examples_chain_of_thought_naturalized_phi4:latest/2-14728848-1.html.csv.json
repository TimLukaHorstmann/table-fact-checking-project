    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify two main aspects from the table:\n\n1. Identify if there is a team associated with Chris Jackson.\n2. Check if the car model driven by Chris Jackson's team is a Mazda RX-7 equipped with a 20B engine.\n\nLet's break down these steps:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n**Step 1: Locate Chris Jackson in the Table**\n\n- We need to find the row where the driver is listed as \"chris jackson.\"\n\nUpon reviewing the table:\n- Row 25 lists \"driver: chris jackson\" and corresponds with \"team: csj engineering steves toy shop.\"\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Car Model and Engine for Chris Jackson's Team**\n\n- From Row 25, we note that:\n  - The car model is \"calibra.\"\n  - The engine is \"chevrolet 6.0 v8.\"\n\n**Step 3: Compare with Claim Details**\n\n- The claim states that Chris Jackson has a team driving a \"mazda rx-7\" equipped with a \"20b engine.\"\n- From Row 25, we see:\n  - The car model is not Mazda RX-7; it's Opel Calibra.\n  - The engine is not a 20B; it's a Chevrolet 6.0 V8.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe claim does not match the details from the table for Chris Jackson. Therefore, the statement \"chris jackson have a team that drive mazda rx - 7 with a 20b engine\" is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Table Cells\n\nThe relevant cell for this verification is Row 25, specifically:\n- Team: csj engineering steves toy shop\n- Driver: chris jackson\n- Car Model: calibra\n- Engine: chevrolet 6.0 v8\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified Chris Jackson's team in Row 25 with the car model Opel Calibra and engine Chevrolet 6.0 V8, which does not match the claim of driving a Mazda RX-7 with a 20B engine.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"driver\", \"value\": \"chris jackson\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"team\", \"value\": \"csj engineering steves toy shop\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"car model\", \"value\": \"calibra\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"engine\", \"value\": \"chevrolet 6.0 v8\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
