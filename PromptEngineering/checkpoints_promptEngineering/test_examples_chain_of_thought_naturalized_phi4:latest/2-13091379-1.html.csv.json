    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the march 741 chassis have f tyre and 6 point\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant parts of the table:\n\n1. **Identify the Row**: We first locate the row that mentions the March 741 chassis.\n   - From the table, we see that the March 741 chassis is mentioned in **Row 5**.\n\n2. **Check Tyres for March 741 Chassis**:\n   - In **Row 5**, under the \"tyres\" column, it states \"g\".\n   - This indicates that the tyres used with the March 741 chassis are of type \"g\", not \"f\".\n\n3. **Check Points for March 741 Chassis**:\n   - Still in **Row 5**, under the \"points\" column, it shows \"6\".\n   - This confirms that the points associated with the March 741 chassis is indeed 6.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states two conditions: the tyres are \"f\" and the points are \"6\".\n   - We have established that the tyres are not \"f\", they are \"g\". \n   - The points being \"6\" is correct, but since one condition (tyres) does not match, the entire claim cannot be true.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the analysis, the claim is false because the tyre type for March 741 is not \"f\".\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Locate the row mentioning the March 741 chassis (Row 5).\",\n    \"Check the 'tyres' column in Row 5: it states 'g', not 'f'.\",\n    \"Check the 'points' column in Row 5: it states '6', which matches the claim.\",\n    \"The claim requires both conditions to be true, but tyres are incorrect (not 'f').\",\n    \"Therefore, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
