    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to perform two checks:\n\n1. **Check if the game between Ipswich Town and Leyton Orient has the highest attendance.**\n2. **Check if this game has the lowest total score among all games listed in the table.**\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n#### 1. Find the Attendance for Each Game\n- Row 1: 9293\n- Row 2: 6261\n- Row 3: 2735\n- Row 4: 2571\n- Row 5: 2566\n- Row 6: 2998\n- Row 7: (irrelevant as the attendance is not numerical and doesn't make sense)\n- Row 8: 5366\n- Row 9: 2682\n- Row 10: 6471\n- Row 11: 5574\n- Row 12: 3399\n- Row 13: 5684\n- Row 14: 6239\n- Row 15: 3525\n- Row 16: 7230\n- Row 17: 3094\n- Row 18: 2360\n- Row 19: **10477**\n\nFrom this list, the game between Ipswich Town and Leyton Orient in Row 19 has the highest attendance of 10,477.\n\n#### 2. Calculate Total Scores for Each Game\nTotal score is calculated as the sum of both teams' scores.\n\n- Row 1: \\(3 + 1 = 4\\)\n- Row 2: \\(1 + 0 = 1\\)\n- Row 3: \\(0 + 4 = 4\\)\n- Row 4: \\(4 + 0 = 4\\)\n- Row 5: \\(0 + 1 = 1\\)\n- Row 6: \\(0 + 0 = 0\\)\n- Row 7: Not applicable as it is not a complete score (text format \"cheltenham town won\")\n- Row 8: \\(2 + 0 = 2\\)\n- Row 9: \\(2 + 0 = 2\\)\n- Row 10: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Row 11: \\(1 + 0 = 1\\)\n- Row 12: \\(1 + 2 = 3\\)\n- Row 13: \\(2 + 1 = 3\\)\n- Row 14: \\(0 + 1 = 1\\)\n- Row 15: \\(0 + 1 = 1\\)\n- Row 16: \\(2 + 3 = 5\\)\n- Row 17: \\(2 + 1 = 3\\)\n- Row 18: \\(1 + 2 = 3\\)\n- Row 19: **\\(4 + 1 = 5\\)**\n\nFrom this list, the lowest total score is 0 from Row 6 (Southend United vs. Cheltenham Town).\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe game between Ipswich Town and Leyton Orient has the highest attendance but does not have the lowest total score (its total score is 5, while Row 6 has a total score of 0). Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Checked each row's attendance to find the highest: Ipswich Town vs. Leyton Orient with 10477.\\n2.

Let's go through each row of the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Row 1**: The score is 3 - 1 (Coventry City vs Aldershot Town). Neither team has a score of 0.\n2. **Row 2**: The score is 1 - 0 (Milton Keynes Dons vs Norwich City). Neither team has a score of 0.\n3. **Row 3**: The score is 0 - 4 (Wycombe Wanderers vs Birmingham City). Wycombe Wanderers scored 0, but Birmingham City did not.\n4. **Row 4**: The score is 4 - 0 (Brighton & Hove Albion vs Barnet). Barnet scored 0, but Brighton & Hove Albion did not.\n5. **Row 5**: The score is 0 - 1 (Gillingham vs Colchester United). Gillingham scored 0, but Colchester United did not.\n6. **Row 6**: The score is 0 - 0 (Southend United vs Cheltenham Town). Both teams scored 0, indicating a draw with no goals.\n7. **Row 7**: The result mentions \"cheltenham town won 1 - 0 after extra time.\" This implies the regular time ended in 0 - 0, but it is not relevant since they eventually scored during extra time.\n8. **Row 8**: The score is 2 - 0 (Swansea City vs Brentford). Neither team has a score of 0.\n9. **Row 9**: The score is 2 - 0 (Luton Town vs Plymouth Argyle). Neither team has a score of 0.\n10. **Row 10**: The score is 1 - 3 (Exeter City vs Southampton). Neither team has a score of 0.\n11. **Row 11**: The score is 1 - 0 (Watford vs Bristol Rovers). Neither team has a score of 0.\n12. **Row 12**: The score is 1 - 2 (Bournemouth vs Cardiff City). Neither team has a score of 0.\n13. **Row 13**: The score is 2 - 1 (Bristol City vs Peterborough United). Neither team has a score of 0.\n14. **Row 14**: The score is 0 - 1 (Charlton Athletic vs Yeovil Town). Charlton Athletic scored 0, but Yeovil Town did not.\n15. **Row 15**: The score is 0 - 1 (Millwall vs Northampton Town). Millwall scored 0, but Northampton Town did not.\n16. **Row 16**: The score is 2 - 3 (Swindon Town vs Queens Park Rangers). Neither team has a score of 0.\n17. **Row 17**: The score is 2 - 1 (Crystal Palace vs Hereford United). Neither team has a score of 0.\n18. **Row 18**: The score is 1 - 2 (Dagenham & Redbridge vs Reading). Neither team has a score of 0.\n19. **Row 19**: The score is 4 - 1 (Ipswich Town vs Leyton Orient). Neither team has a score of 0.\n\nFrom the analysis, we find that Row 6 represents a game where both teams scored 0 goals (Southend United vs Cheltenham Town).\n\nTherefore, the claim \"there be no game that result in a 0 score for both team\" is FALSE because there is at least one match with such an outcome.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We examined each row of the table to check if any match ended with a score of 0 - 0.
