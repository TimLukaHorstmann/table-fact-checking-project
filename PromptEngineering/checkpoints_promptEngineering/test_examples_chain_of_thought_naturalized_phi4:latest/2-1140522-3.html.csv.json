    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the latest PRR class locomotive be build the year before 1967\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table data regarding the build dates of each PRR class locomotive:\n\n1. **Identify Build Years**:\n   - Row 1: The PRR class `gs4` was built between 1948 and 1950.\n   - Row 2: The PRR class `gf25` was built in 1965.\n   - Row 3: The PRR class `gf25a` was built in 1965.\n   - Row 4: The PRR class `gf28a` was built in 1966.\n   - Row 5: The PRR class `gf30a` was built in 1967.\n\n2. **Determine the Latest Build Year**:\n   - From the identified build years, the latest year is 1967 for the PRR class `gf30a`.\n\n3. **Compare Against Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the latest PRR class locomotive was built the year before 1967.\n   - However, the data shows that the latest build year is 1967 itself.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the latest PRR class locomotive (`gf30a`) was built in 1967 and not before 1967, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells from the table for this analysis are those containing the build dates:\n\n- Row 1: Build date (1948 - 1950)\n- Row 2: Build date (1965)\n- Row 3: Build date (1965)\n- Row 4: Build date (1966)\n- Row 5: Build date (1967)\n\nHere is the final output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified build years for each PRR class locomotive from the table.
