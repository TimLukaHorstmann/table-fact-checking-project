    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, let's analyze the data step by step:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Class B Entries**: We need to find all entries in the table that are classified as \"Class B\". According to the table:\n   - Row 4: The class is \"b\" for call sign wmhr, frequency 102.9 fm.\n\n2. **Check Frequency of Class B Entries**: For any entry identified as Class B, check if its frequency matches 91.1 fm.\n   - From step 1, we know only one station (Row 4) has the class \"b\".\n   - The frequency for Row 4 is 102.9 fm, not 91.1 fm.\n\n3. **Count Class B Entries with Frequency 91.1 fm**: We need to see if there are two entries that match both criteria: class \"b\" and frequency 91.1 fm.\n   - From the previous steps, we found only one entry with class \"b\", and it does not have a frequency of 91.1 fm.\n\n4. **Conclusion Based on Analysis**: Since there is no Class B station with a frequency of 91.1 fm, let alone two such stations, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe claim that \"there be 2 class b 's in the list of class which both have a frequency of 91.1 fm\" is FALSE because:\n\n- There is only one Class B station.\n- The single Class B station does not have a frequency of 91.1 fm.\n\nRelevant cells for this analysis are from Row 4, as it contains information about the class and frequency that disprove the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified all entries with 'Class B'. Only one entry (Row 4) matches. Checked its frequency, which is not 91.1 fm. Therefore, there are no two Class B stations with a frequency of 91.1 fm.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
