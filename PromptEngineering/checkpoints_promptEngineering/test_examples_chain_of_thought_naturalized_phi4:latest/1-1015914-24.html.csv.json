    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"ngalben be the we two for the you two ngipeniya\" is TRUE or FALSE, let's break down the components of the claim using the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Components:**\n   - The claim involves three parts:\n     - \"ngalben\" which refers to \"we two\" in a specific case.\n     - \"you two ngipeniya\" where \"ngipeniya\" is associated with \"you two.\"\n   \n2. **Locate \"ngalben\":**\n   - According to the table, \"ngalben\" appears in Row 2 under the genitive case for \"we two.\"\n\n3. **Locate \"you two ngipeniya\":**\n   - We need to find where \"ngipeniya\" appears for \"you two.\"\n   - \"ngipeniya\" is found in Row 5, which corresponds to the locative case.\n\n4. **Verify Consistency:**\n   - The claim suggests that \"ngalben\" (genitive) should be associated with \"you two ngipeniya\" (locative).\n   - However, each row in the table represents a different grammatical case, and the suffixes for \"we two\" and \"you two\" differ across these cases.\n   - Specifically, \"ngalben\" is the genitive form, while \"ngipeniya\" is the locative form. They are not interchangeable or directly related within the same context.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since \"ngalben\" and \"ngipeniya\" belong to different grammatical cases (genitive vs. locative), they cannot be used interchangeably as suggested by the claim.\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE because it incorrectly associates suffixes from different cases.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 2, Column \"we two\": \"ngalben\"\n- Row 5, Column \"you two\": \"ngipeniya\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim 'ngalben be the we two for the you two ngipeniya' is analyzed by identifying 'ngalben' as the genitive form of 'we two' and 'ngipeniya' as the locative form of 'you two.'
