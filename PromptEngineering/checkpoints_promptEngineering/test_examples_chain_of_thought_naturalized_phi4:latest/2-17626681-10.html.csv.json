    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the attendance figures for Manchester United FC's games during the 2008-09 season is true or false, we need to compare the attendance numbers of each listed game against the final game.\n\n**Claim:** \"In the 2008 - 09 Manchester United FC season, the final round has higher attendance than any other game listed.\"\n\n### Steps for Evaluation:\n\n1. **Identify Attendance Figures:**\n   - Extract the attendance figures from each row in the table.\n   - Row 1: First knockout round first leg vs Internazionale, Attendance = 80,018\n   - Row 2: First knockout round second leg vs Internazionale, Attendance = 74,769\n   - Row 3: Quarter-final first leg vs Porto, Attendance = 74,517\n   - Row 4: Quarter-final second leg vs Porto, Attendance = 50,010\n   - Row 5: Semi-final first leg vs Arsenal, Attendance = 74,733\n   - Row 6: Semi-final second leg vs Arsenal, Attendance = 59,867\n   - Row 7: Final vs Barcelona, Attendance = 62,467\n\n2. **Compare the Final Game's Attendance with Other Games:**\n   - The attendance for the final game (Row 7) is 62,467.\n   - Compare this figure to all other games:\n     - Row 1: 80,018\n     - Row 2: 74,769\n     - Row 3: 74,517\n     - Row 4: 50,010\n     - Row 5: 74,733\n     - Row 6: 59,867\n\n3. **Determine if the Final Game Had Higher Attendance Than Any Other Game:**\n   - Clearly, 62,467 (final game) is less than:\n     - 80,018 (Row 1)\n     - 74,769 (Row 2)\n     - 74,517 (Row 3)\n     - 74,733 (Row 5)\n\nSince the final game's attendance of 62,467 is not higher than any other game listed, the claim is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that \"the final round has higher attendance than any other game listed\" is FALSE. The highest attendance was at the first knockout round first leg vs Internazionale with an attendance of 80,018.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Extracted the attendance figures from each row and compared them to find that the final game's attendance (62,467) is lower than several other games.
