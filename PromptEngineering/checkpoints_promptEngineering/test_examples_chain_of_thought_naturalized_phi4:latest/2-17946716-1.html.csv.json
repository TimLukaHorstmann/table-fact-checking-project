    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"October 9, 1960 be the date after week 3\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data for Week 3 and verify if October 9, 1960, is indeed listed as the date following this week.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Week 3 Data:**\n   - Look at Row 3 in the table.\n   - According to the table:\n     - `week`: 3\n     - `date`: October 9, 1960\n     - This confirms that October 9, 1960, is the date associated with Week 3.\n\n2. **Verify if October 9, 1960, is After Week 3:**\n   - Since Row 3 explicitly states that the date for Week 3 is October 9, 1960, it cannot be after Week 3.\n   - The claim suggests that October 9, 1960, should come after Week 3. However, based on the table, this date is exactly associated with Week 3.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim \"October 9, 1960, be the date after week 3\" is false because October 9, 1960, is the date for Week 3 itself, not a date that follows it.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Row 3 shows that October 9, 1960, is the date for Week 3.
