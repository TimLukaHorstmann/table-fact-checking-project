We need to inspect this column across all rows.\n\n2. **Check Each Row's Original Air Date:**\n   - **Row 1:** Original air date is 2009.\n   - **Row 2:** Original air date is 2009.\n   - **Row 3:** Original air date is 2009.\n   - **Row 4:** Original air date is 2009.\n   - **Row 5:** Original air date is 2009.\n   - **Row 6:** Original air date is 2009.\n   - **Row 7:** Original air date is 2009.\n   - **Row 8:** Original air date is 2009.\n\n3. **Count the Number of Episodes with Air Date 2009:**\n   - All 8 episodes have an original air date of 2009.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"all but 2 episodes have an original air date of 2009.\"\n   - Since all 8 episodes have an air date of 2009, this means 0 episodes do not have an air date of 2009.\n   - Therefore, the statement is incorrect because it implies there should be 2 episodes with a different air date.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is FALSE because all episodes have an original air date of 2009, not \"all but 2.\"\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- All rows are relevant for checking the \"original air date\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
