Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify key elements in the claim: founded in 1891, left in 1975, located in Hickory, North Carolina.\",\n    \"Search for institutions founded in 1891.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify each component against the provided table:\n\n1. **Verify the Institution Founded in 1839:**\n   - The claim states a private institution founded in 1839.\n   - Reviewing the \"founded\" column across all rows:\n     - Row 5 (East Carolina University) and Row 13 (University of North Carolina at Pembroke) were both founded in 1839. However, only East Carolina University is public; thus not relevant here.\n\n2. **Verify Private Institution:**\n   - From step 1, we identified East Carolina University as a potential candidate since it was founded in 1839.\n   - According to the \"type\" column:\n     - Row 5 (East Carolina University) is of type \"public.\"\n\n3. **No Other Private Institution Founded in 1839:**\n   - Checking all rows for private institutions founded in 1839, no other matches are found.\n\n4. **Verify Left in 1975 and Located in Hickory, North Carolina:**\n   - The claim specifies the institution left in 1975.\n   - Reviewing the \"left\" column:\n     - Row 6 (Elon University), Row 9 (Lenoir-Rhyne University), and Row 17 (Western Carolina University) all have \"left\" as 1975.\n\n5. **Verify Location:**\n   - According to the \"location\" column, check the locations of institutions from step 4:\n     - Row 6 is located in Elon, North Carolina.\n     - Row 9 is located in Hickory, North Carolina (matching the location specified in the claim).\n     - Row 17 is located in Cullowhee, North Carolina.\n\n6. **Verify Type:**\n   - From step 4, only Row 9 matches both \"left\" as 1975 and location as Hickory.\n   - According to the \"type\" column:\n     - Row 9 (Lenoir-Rhyne University) is of type \"private.\"\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Lenoir-Rhyne University fits all criteria specified in the claim: it is a private institution, founded before 1839 (founded in 1891), located in Hickory, North Carolina, and left its conference in 1975.\n\nBased on these steps, the claim incorrectly identifies the founding year.
