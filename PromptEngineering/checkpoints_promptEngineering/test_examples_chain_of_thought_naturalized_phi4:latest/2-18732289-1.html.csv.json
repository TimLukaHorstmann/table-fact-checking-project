    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Tim Euhus be the last pick\" is true or false, we will analyze the information provided in the table step-by-step.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Tim Euhus's Pick:**\n   - According to Row 4 of the table:\n     - Player: Tim Euhus\n     - Round: 4\n     - Pick: 109\n\n2. **Examine All Picks in the Table:**\n   - We need to identify which pick number is the highest, as this would correspond to being the last pick.\n\n3. **List of Picks by Number:**\n   - Row 1: Pick 13 (Lee Evans)\n   - Row 2: Pick 22 (JP Losman)\n   - Row 3: Pick 74 (Tim Anderson)\n   - Row 4: Pick 109 (Tim Euhus)\n   - Row 5: Pick 207 (Dylan McFarland)\n   - Row 6: Pick 214 (Jonathan Smith)\n\n4. **Determine the Highest Pick Number:**\n   - The highest pick number from the list is 214, which belongs to Jonathan Smith in Row 6.\n\n5. **Compare Tim Euhus's Pick with the Last Pick:**\n   - Tim Euhus was picked at number 109.\n   - Jonathan Smith, not Tim Euhus, was the last pick at number 214.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim \"Tim Euhus be the last pick\" is false because the last pick was Jonathan Smith with pick number 214. Tim Euhus's pick number was 109.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify Tim Euhus's pick: Row 4 shows Tim Euhus as Pick 109.\",\n    \"Examine all picks in the table to find the highest pick number.\",\n    \"List of Picks by Number: 13, 22, 74, 109, 207, 214.\",\n    \"Determine the highest pick number: 214 (Jonathan Smith).\",\n    \"Compare Tim Euhus's pick with the last pick: Tim Euhus was not the last pick; Jonathan Smith was.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
