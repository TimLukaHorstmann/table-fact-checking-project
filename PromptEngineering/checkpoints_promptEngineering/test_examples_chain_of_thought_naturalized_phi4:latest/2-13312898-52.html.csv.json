    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"4 offensive players be draft by the Indianapolis Colts\" is true or false, we need to examine each row of the table and identify the positions associated with offensive roles.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Offensive Positions:**\n   - Offensive positions typically include roles such as quarterback, running back, wide receiver, tight end, offensive lineman (like guard, tackle), etc.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row:**\n   - **Row 1:** Position is \"safety\" which is a defensive position.\n   - **Row 2:** Position is \"tight end,\" which is an offensive position.\n   - **Row 3:** Position is \"linebacker,\" which is a defensive position.\n   - **Row 4:** Position is \"linebacker,\" which is a defensive position.\n   - **Row 5:** Position is \"cornerback,\" which is a defensive position.\n   - **Row 6:** Position is \"guard,\" which is an offensive position.\n   - **Row 7:** Position is \"cornerback,\" which is a defensive position.\n   - **Row 8:** Position is \"quarterback,\" which is an offensive position.\n   - **Row 9:** Position is \"placekicker,\" which can be considered as part of the special teams or offense.\n\n3. **Count Offensive Players:**\n   - From the analysis:\n     - Row 2 (Tight End)\n     - Row 6 (Guard)\n     - Row 8 (Quarterback)\n     - Row 9 (Placekicker)\n\n   These are four offensive players identified in the table.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that \"4 offensive players be draft by the Indianapolis Colts.\" Based on our analysis, there are indeed four offensive positions listed: Tight End, Guard, Quarterback, and Placekicker.
