    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"0 , 35723 be 1 value for yellow, which be at 1.09%\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table row by row.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Columns:**\n   - The columns represent different ethnic groups and their percentages in Brazil.\n   - For each group, there are two values:\n     - An absolute number (e.g., 420,952 for yellow).\n     - A percentage or a related value (e.g., 1.09% for yellow).\n\n2. **Locate the Yellow Ethnic Group:**\n   - The table lists data for various ethnic groups including \"yellow.\"\n\n3. **Check Row 1:**\n   - Yellow values are given as:\n     - Absolute number: 420,952\n     - Percentage: 1.09%\n   - These match the claim's percentage but not the absolute number.\n\n4. **Check Row 2:**\n   - The value for yellow is listed as \"20 , 02%\".\n   - This does not match either the percentage or the format of the claim.\n\n5. **Check Row 3:**\n   - Yellow values are given as:\n     - Absolute number (percentage): 0 , 92%\n   - This does not match the claim's absolute number or percentage.\n\n6. **Check Row 4:**\n   - Yellow values are given as:\n     - Absolute number: 1,178,391\n     - This does not match the claim's absolute number.\n\n7. **Check Row 5:**\n   - Yellow values are given as:\n     - Absolute number: 0 , 35723\n     - This matches the claim's absolute number.\n   - However, there is no percentage value provided in this row for yellow.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - The value \"0 , 35723\" does correspond to an entry under the yellow category in Row 5 as an absolute number.\n   - However, it is not associated with the percentage \"1.09%\" in any row.\n   - Therefore, the claim that \"0 , 35723 be 1 value for yellow, which be at 1.09%\" is false because there is no direct association of this number with the given percentage.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was analyzed to find where 'yellow' appears with both an absolute number and a percentage.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"1,178,391 be the yellow fertility rate when Brazil be 0 , 43407\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table's data systematically.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Table Structure:**\n   - The table has five rows and six columns for each row.\n   - Each row seems to represent a different aspect of demographic data in Brazil.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Data:**\n   - We need to find where \"yellow\" and \"Brazil 100%\" are mentioned, as these relate to the claim.\n\n3. **Analyzing Row 1:**\n   - This row lists absolute numbers for each racial group.\n   - Yellow population: 420,952\n   - Total Brazil population: 45,932,294\n\n4. **Analyzing Row 2:**\n   - This row shows percentages relative to the total Brazilian population.\n   - Yellow percentage: 20.02%\n   - Total Brazil percentage: 24.08%\n\n5. **Analyzing Row 3:**\n   - This row seems to show proportions of each racial group as a percentage of their own category.\n   - Yellow proportion: 0.92%\n   - Total Brazil proportion: 100%\n\n6. **Analyzing Row 4:**\n   - This row lists another set of absolute numbers for each racial group.\n   - Yellow population: 1,178,391\n   - Total Brazil population: 105,816,285\n\n7. **Analyzing Row 5:**\n   - This row shows changes or differences in the numbers from another dataset (possibly a year-on-year change).\n   - Yellow change: 0,35723\n   - Total Brazil change: 0,43407\n\n8. **Evaluating the Claim:**\n   - The claim states \"1,178,391 be the yellow fertility rate when Brazil be 0 , 43407.\"\n   - From Row 4, we see that 1,178,391 is indeed the number for the yellow population.\n   - However, Row 5 indicates a change of 0,35723 for yellow and 0,43407 for the total Brazilian population.\n   - The claim seems to confuse absolute numbers with changes or rates. It incorrectly associates the absolute number from Row 4 with the change in Row 5.\n\n9. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is false because it misinterprets the data by associating an absolute number (Row 4) with a change (Row 5).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim incorrectly associates the absolute number of the yellow population from Row 4 with the change in numbers from Row 5.
