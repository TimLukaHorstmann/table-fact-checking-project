    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Muhsin Corbbrey have win 2 fight by tko between 2005 and 2009\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data and focus on fights won by Muhsin Corbbrey via TKO (Technical Knockout) within the specified date range. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify Date Range:** The claim specifies the period between 2005 and 2009, inclusive. We need to examine rows with dates falling within this range.\n\n2. **Filter by Result Type:** Focus only on rows where the result is \"win\" since we are interested in fights that Muhsin Corbbrey won.\n\n3. **Filter by Method of Victory:** Within the subset of winning fights, further filter by the method being \"tko\" (Technical Knockout).\n\n4. **Count Relevant Wins:** Count how many times Muhsin Corbbrey achieved a win via TKO during this period.\n\nLet's analyze each row in the table:\n\n- **Row 1:** Date: 2009-02-28, Result: win, Method: decision. Not a TKO.\n- **Row 2:** Date: 2006-09-15, Result: win, Method: tko. This is a TKO win.\n- **Row 3:** Date: 2006-06-15, Result: loss. Not applicable as it's not a win.\n- **Row 4:** Date: 2006-04-21, Result: win, Method: tko. This is a TKO win.\n- **Row 5:** Date: 2006-03-09, Result: win, Method: decision (unanimous). Not a TKO.\n- **Row 6:** Date: 2006-01-26, Result: win, Method: decision (unanimous). Not a TKO.\n- **Row 7:** Date: 2005-11-26, Result: win, Method: decision (unanimous). Not a TKO.\n- **Row 8:** Date: 2005-04-26, Result: loss. Not applicable as it's not a win.\n- **Row 9:** Date: 2005-04-08, Result: draw. Not applicable as it's not a win.\n\nFrom this analysis, we find that there are two instances of Muhsin Corbbrey winning by TKO between 2005 and 2009:\n\n- Row 2 (2006-09-15)\n- Row 4 (2006-04-21)\n\nTherefore, the claim is true.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Muhsin Corbbrey's fights between 2006 and 2009 is true or false, we need to evaluate each row of the table for matches fitting the criteria: a fight lasting more than 5 rounds during that period.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Time Frame**: The claim specifies the period between 2006 and 2009.
