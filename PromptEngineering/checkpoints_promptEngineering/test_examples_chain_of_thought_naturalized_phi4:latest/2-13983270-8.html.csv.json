    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"79 - 50 be record on august 24\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data step-by-step.\n\n1. **Identify the Date**: The claim refers to August 24. We need to locate the row that corresponds to this date.\n   \n2. **Locate the Row for August 24**:\n   - From the table, Row 24 contains the date \"august 24\". \n   \n3. **Check the Record on August 24**:\n   - In Row 24, under the column labeled \"record\", we find the value \"79 - 50\".\n   \n4. **Verify Consistency**:\n   - Ensure that this record follows logically from previous records in the table.\n   - Prior to August 24 (i.e., on August 23), the record was \"79 - 51\" as seen in Row 23.\n   - After August 24, the record is \"80 - 51\" as shown in Row 25.\n   - The progression of records shows a decrease in losses by one from August 23 to August 24 and then an increase in wins by one from August 24 to August 25.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The record on August 24 is indeed \"79 - 50\", which matches the claim.\n\nThus, the claim is true based on the data provided in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
