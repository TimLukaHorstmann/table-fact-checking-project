This is indicated by any result other than \"1r\".\n\n3. **Check Each Year and Tournament:**\n\n   - **2006:**\n     - Australian Open: a (Assuming 'a' means advanced, likely past 1st round)\n     - French Open: 2r\n     - Wimbledon: 1r\n     - US Open: 1r\n\n     Total advancements beyond 1st round in 2006: 2 times.\n\n   - **2007:**\n     - Australian Open: 2r\n     - French Open: 3r\n     - Wimbledon: 2r\n     - US Open: sf\n\n     Total advancements beyond 1st round in 2007: 4 times.\n\n   - **2008:**\n     - Australian Open: 2r\n     - French Open: 3r\n     - Wimbledon: 2r\n     - US Open: 1r\n\n     Total advancements beyond 1st round in 2008: 3 times.\n\n   - **2009:**\n     - Australian Open: 1r\n     - French Open: 2r\n     - Wimbledon: 1r\n     - US Open: 1r\n\n     Total advancements beyond 1st round in 2009: 1 time.\n\n   - **2010:**\n     - Australian Open: 2r\n     - French Open: 2r\n     - Wimbledon: 1r\n     - US Open: 1r\n\n     Total advancements beyond 1st round in 2010: 2 times.\n\n   - **2011:**\n     - Australian Open: qf\n     - French Open: 3r\n     - Wimbledon: 2r\n     - US Open: 1r\n\n     Total advancements beyond 1st round in 2011: 3 times.\n\n   - **2012:**\n     - Australian Open: 2r\n     - French Open: 2r\n     - Wimbledon: 3r\n     - US Open: 2r\n\n     Total advancements beyond 1st round in 2012: 4 times.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFrom the analysis above, Vladimira progressed past the 1st round more than two times each year from 2006 to 2012.
