    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the match held on January 26, 2006, having a result of 2 - 1 is true or false, we need to examine the relevant row from the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - The claim specifies the date as \"January 26, 2006\". We need to find this specific date in the table.\n   - By examining each row for the 'date' column, we locate that Row 8 corresponds to January 26, 2006.\n\n2. **Check the Result Column:**\n   - Once we have identified Row 8 as the relevant row, we need to verify the result of the match on this date.\n   - In Row 8, under the 'result' column, it states \"2 - 1\".\n\n3. **Verify Against the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the result was \"2 - 1\". This matches exactly with what is listed in the table for Row 8.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the result from the table matches the claim, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the relevant row by matching the date 'January 26, 2006' in the table, found Row 8. Checked the 'result' column for this row and confirmed it states '2 - 1', which matches the claim.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
