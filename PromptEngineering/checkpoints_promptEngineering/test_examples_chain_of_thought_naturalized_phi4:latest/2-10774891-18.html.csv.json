    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to analyze each row in the table for both home and away teams' scores. The claim states: \"more than 3 score from both home and away team be less than 10 point.\" \n\nIn Australian Rules Football scoring:\n- A goal (worth 6 points) counts as a single score.\n- A behind (worth 1 or 2 points, depending on how it was scored) does not count as a full score.\n\nThe claim requires us to check if there are more than three scores from both the home and away teams in each match, where these additional scores contribute less than 10 points collectively. \n\nLet's evaluate each row:\n\n### Row-by-Row Analysis\n\n**Row 1:**\n- **Home Team:** North Melbourne - Score: 10.20 (80)\n  - Goals = 10, Behinds = 20\n  - Total Points from goals = 10 * 6 = 60 points\n  - Remaining points from behinds = 80 - 60 = 20 points\n  - Number of behinds = 20; more than 3 behinds, contributing exactly 20 points (more than 10).\n\n- **Away Team:** South Melbourne - Score: 17.11 (113)\n  - Goals = 17, Behinds = 11\n  - Total Points from goals = 17 * 6 = 102 points\n  - Remaining points from behinds = 113 - 102 = 11 points\n  - Number of behinds = 11; more than 3 behinds, contributing exactly 11 points (more than 10).\n\nBoth teams have more than 3 behinds, and the total points from these behinds exceed 10.\n\n**Row 2:**\n- **Home Team:** Melbourne - Score: 18.12 (120)\n  - Goals = 18, Behinds = 12\n  - Total Points from goals = 18 * 6 = 108 points\n  - Remaining points from behinds = 120 - 108 = 12 points\n  - Number of behinds = 12; more than 3 behinds, contributing exactly 12 points (more than 10).\n\n- **Away Team:** Richmond - Score: 10.11 (71)\n  - Goals = 10, Behinds = 11\n  - Total Points from goals = 10 * 6 = 60 points\n  - Remaining points from behinds = 71 - 60 = 11 points\n  - Number of behinds = 11; more than 3 behinds, contributing exactly 11 points (more than 10).\n\nBoth teams have more than 3 behinds, and the total points from these behinds exceed 10.\n\n**Row 3:**\n- **Home Team:** Footscray - Score: 8.11 (59)\n  - Goals = 8, Behinds = 11\n  - Total Points from goals = 8 * 6 = 48 points\n  - Remaining points from behinds = 59 - 48 = 11 points\n  - Number of behinds = 11; more than 3 behinds, contributing exactly 11 points (more than 10).\n\n- **Away Team:** Hawthorn - Score: 7.15 (57)\n  - Goals = 7, Behinds = 15\n  - Total Points from goals = 7 * 6 = 42 points\n  - Remaining points from behinds = 57 - 42 = 15 points\n  - Number of behinds = 15; more than 3 behinds, contributing exactly 15 points (more than 10).\n\nBoth teams have more than 3 behinds, and the total points from these behinds exceed 10.\n\n**Row 4:**\n- **Home Team:** Fitzroy - Score: 15.14 (104)\n  - Goals = 15, Behinds = 14\n  - Total Points from goals = 15 * 6 = 90 points\n  - Remaining points from behinds = 104 - 90 = 14 points\n  - Number of behinds = 14; more than 3 behinds, contributing exactly 14 points (more than 10).\n\n- **Away Team:** Geelong - Score: 10.20 (80)\n  - Goals = 10, Behinds = 20\n  - Total Points from goals = 10 * 6 = 60 points\n  - Remaining points from behinds = 80 - 60 = 20 points\n  - Number of behinds = 20; more than 3 behinds, contributing exactly 20 points (more than 10).\n\nBoth teams have more than 3 behinds, and the total points from these behinds exceed 10.\n\n**Row 5:**\n- **Home Team:** St Kilda - Score: 14.12 (96)\n  - Goals = 14, Behinds = 12\n  - Total Points from goals = 14 * 6 = 84 points\n  - Remaining points from behinds = 96 - 84 = 12 points\n  - Number of behinds = 12; more than 3 behinds, contributing exactly 12 points (more than 10).\n\n- **Away Team:** Collingwood - Score: 7.14 (56)\n  - Goals = 7, Behinds = 14\n  - Total Points from goals = 7 * 6 = 42 points\n  - Remaining points from behinds = 56 - 42 = 14 points\n  - Number of behinds = 14; more than 3 behinds, contributing exactly 14 points (more than 10).\n\nBoth teams have more than 3 behinds, and the total points from these behinds exceed 10.\n\n**Row 6:**\n- **Home Team:** Essendon - Score: 17.21 (123)\n  - Goals = 17, Behinds = 21\n  - Total Points from goals = 17 * 6 = 102 points\n  - Remaining points from behinds = 123 - 102 = 21 points\n  - Number of behinds = 21; more than 3 behinds, contributing exactly 21 points (more than 10).\n\n- **Away Team:** Carlton - Score: 9.8 (62)\n  - Goals = 9, Behinds = 8\n  - Total Points from goals = 9 * 6 = 54 points\n  - Remaining points from behinds = 62 - 54 = 8 points\n  - Number of behinds = 8; more than 3 behinds, contributing exactly 8 points (less than 10).\n\nHere, the home team has more than 3 behinds with points exceeding 10, but the away team does not meet the claim as their total is less than 10.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn every row except Row 6, both teams have more than three behinds contributing to a score of more than 10. In Row 6, only Essendon meets this condition, while Carlton's contribution from behinds is less than 10 points. Therefore, the claim does not hold for all rows.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": false,\n  \"explanation\": \"In every row except Row 6, both teams have more than three behinds contributing to a score of more than 10. In Row 6, only Essendon meets this condition, while Carlton's contribution from behinds is less than 10 points.\"\n}\n```",
