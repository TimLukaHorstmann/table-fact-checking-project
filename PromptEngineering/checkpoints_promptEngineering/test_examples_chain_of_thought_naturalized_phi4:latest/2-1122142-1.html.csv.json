This is incorrect based on the table.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Grid Position for Robert Manzon\n- From Row 9, we see that Robert Manzon's grid position was 18.\n- The claim states an average grid of 22, which does not match his actual starting grid of 18.\n\nSince both points in the claim are incorrect based on the table data, the entire claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
