    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, let's analyze the table step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Relevant Information\n\nThe claim states a specific number (29) for ties played by a player who debuted in 1930. We need to locate this information in the table:\n\n- **Debut Year**: Look at the column \"debut\" and find the row with a debut year of 1930.\n  \n### Step 2: Locate Player with Debut Year 1930\n\nExamine each row for the debut year:\n\n- Row 1: D\u00e9but = 1967\n- Row 2: D\u00e9but = 1959\n- **Row 3**: D\u00e9but = 1930 (This matches our requirement)\n- Row 4: D\u00e9but = 1936\n- Row 5: D\u00e9but = 1933\n- Row 6: D\u00e9but = 1953\n- Row 7: D\u00e9but = 1961\n- Row 8: D\u00e9but = 1933\n- Row 9: D\u00e9but = 1981\n\n### Step 3: Check Ties Played for the Identified Player\n\nFor the player in Row 3 (franjo kukuljevi\u0107):\n\n- **Ties Played**: 18\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Claimed Value\n\nThe claim states that the number of ties played should be 29. However, from our examination:\n\n- Ties Played for franjo kukuljevi\u0107 = 18\n\nSince 18 does not equal 29, the claim is false.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim \"29 be the number of tie play with a debut year of 1930\" is FALSE because the actual number of ties played by the player who debuted in 1930 (franjo kukuljevi\u0107) is 18.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the row where the debut year is 1930. Row 3 matches this criterion with franjo kukuljevi\u0107 as the player. Check the 'ties played' for this row, which is 18.
