    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze the table data for any matches between the Oakland Raiders and the Kansas City Chiefs in 2012 at Arrowhead Stadium with a result of 15 - 0.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Year:** \n   - The claim pertains to the year 2012.\n\n2. **Filter Rows by Year:**\n   - We need to look for entries from 2012 in the table:\n     - Row 5: year: 2012\n     - Row 6: year: 2012\n\n3. **Check Location for Each Entry:**\n   - The claim specifies Arrowhead Stadium as the location.\n\n4. **Evaluate Each 2012 Entry:**\n   - **Row 5:** \n     - Winner: Oakland Raiders\n     - Result: 26 - 16\n     - Location: arrowhead stadium\n     - This does not match the claim (wrong result and wrong outcome).\n   \n   - **Row 6:**\n     - Winner: Oakland Raiders\n     - Result: 15 - 0\n     - Location: oco coliseum\n     - This matches the result but occurs at a different location (O.Co Coliseum, not Arrowhead Stadium).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - None of the entries from 2012 show a game where the Oakland Raiders lost to the Kansas City Chiefs with a score of 15 - 0 at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that in 2012, the Oakland Raiders lost to the Kansas City Chiefs with a result of 15 - 0 at Arrowhead Stadium. By examining the table for entries from 2012 and filtering by location (Arrowhead Stadium), we find that while there was a game with a 15 - 0 score, it took place at O.Co Coliseum, not Arrowhead Stadium. Additionally, in this match, the Raiders were the winners, not losers. Therefore, no entry matches all parts of the claim.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
