    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table data and verify if any episode has a number less than 11 for the column \"no in series\". Here's how we can systematically approach this:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The statement claims that among all episodes listed, none have an episode number less than 11 in the series. This means every episode must have a \"no in series\" value of at least 11.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**: We need to check each row's \"no in series\" column for values:\n\n   - Row 1: no in series = 11\n   - Row 2: no in series = 12\n   - Row 3: no in series = 13\n   - Row 4: no in series = 14\n   - Row 5: no in series = 15\n   - Row 6: no in series = 16\n   - Row 7: no in series = 17\n   - Row 8: no in series = 18\n   - Row 9: no in series = 19\n   - Row 10: no in series = 20\n   - Row 11: no in series = 21\n   - Row 12: no in series = 22\n   - Row 13: no in series = 23\n\n3. **Compare with the Claim**: According to the table, all values for \"no in series\" are equal to or greater than 11.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since every episode has a \"no in series\" value of at least 11, the claim is true.\n\n5. **Relevant Data Points**: While all rows are technically relevant since they contribute to verifying the claim, specifically the column \"no in series\" for each row should be examined.\n\nHere's how we can represent this analysis in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim states that no episode number in the 'no in series' column is less than 11.\",\n    \"Reviewing each row, all values of 'no in series' are checked.\",\n    \"Every value starts from 11 and increases without any being less than 11.\",\n    \"Therefore, the claim holds true as no episode number is below 11.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
