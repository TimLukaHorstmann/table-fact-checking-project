    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we must determine how many times Bob Carmichael played in the final alongside Frew McMillan and Allan Stone, respectively.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:**\n   - We need to check the \"Player A\", \"Player B\", and \"Player C\" columns for matches where Bob Carmichael was involved with either Frew McMillan or Allan Stone in the final.\n\n2. **Check Matches with Frew McMillan:**\n   - **Row 5:** Player A is Frew McMillan, Player B is Bob Carmichael.\n   - **Row 6:** Player A is Frew McMillan, Player B is Bob Carmichael.\n   - **Row 7:** Player A is Frew McMillan, Player B is Bob Carmichael.\n   - **Row 8:** Player A is Frew McMillan, Player B is Bob Carmichael.\n   - **Row 9:** Player A is Frew McMillan, Player B is Bob Carmichael.\n\n3. **Check Matches with Allan Stone:**\n   - **Row 14:** Player A is Allan Stone, Player C is Bob Carmichael.\n   - **Row 15:** Player A is Allan Stone, Player C is Bob Carmichael.\n   - **Row 16:** Player A is Allan Stone, Player C is Bob Carmichael.\n\n4. **Count the Instances:**\n   - Matches with Frew McMillan: 5 times (Rows 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9).\n   - Matches with Allan Stone: 3 times (Rows 14, 15, and 16).\n\n### Conclusion:\nBob Carmichael played in the final with Frew McMillan five times and with Allan Stone three times.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Bob Carmichael won every tournament he played with Brian Teacher\" is true, we need to examine all the entries involving Bob Carmichael as a partner with Brian Teacher. Here are the steps for reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Entries**: Look through each row in the data to find instances where Bob Carmichael's name appears alongside Brian Teacher.\n2. **Check Outcomes**: For these identified entries, check if the outcome is \"winner\" or not.\n\nLet\u2019s go through each step and examine the relevant rows:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Row 28**:\n   - **Outcome**: Runner-up\n   - **Partner**: Brian Teacher\n   - This indicates a loss when partnered with Brian Teacher.\n\n2. **Row 32**:\n   - **Outcome**: Runner-up\n   - **Partner**: Brian Teacher\n   - Another instance of a tournament where Bob Carmichael, paired with Brian Teacher, did not win.\n\n3. **Row 33**:\n   - **Outcome**: Runner-up\n   - **Partner**: Brian Teacher\n   - Yet another loss in partnership with Brian Teacher.\n\nFrom this analysis:\n\n- We have found three entries (Rows 28, 32, and 33) where Bob Carmichael played with Brian Teacher.\n- In all these instances, the outcome was \"runner-up,\" indicating that they did not win any of those tournaments.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on our examination, the claim is false.
