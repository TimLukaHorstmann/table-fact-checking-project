    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine each row to identify teams involved in matches where the aggregate score was a tie.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that there are 2 teams from the 2000 Macedonian Cup that had ties in their aggregate scores.\n\n2. **Identify Aggregate Scores**: We need to look at each row's aggregate (agg) column, which indicates the total score over both legs of the match for both teams.\n\n3. **Look for Ties**:\n   - A tie in an aggregate means both team 1 and team 2 have the same total score after both matches.\n   \n4. **Analyze Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: Team 1 (sloga jugomagnat) vs. Team 2 (pobeda), agg: 2 - 1\n     - Not a tie.\n   - **Row 2**: Team 1 (pelister) vs. Team 2 (sileks), agg: 5 - 5\n     - This is a tie. Teams involved: pelister and sileks.\n   - **Row 3**: Team 1 (rabotni\u010dki) vs. Team 2 (\u0161kendija hb), agg: 3 - 3\n     - Despite being equal, this is not considered a regular tie because it includes \"(1 - 3 p)\" indicating penalty shootout or similar decider.\n   - **Row 4**: Team 1 (belasica) vs. Team 2 (bregalnica \u0161tip), agg: 7 - 1\n     - Not a tie.\n   - **Row 5**: Team 1 (karaorman) vs. Team 2 (borec mhk), agg: 4 - 4\n     - This is a tie. Teams involved: karaorman and borec mhk.\n   - **Row 6**: Team 1 (vardar) vs. Team 2 (napredok), agg: 7 - 1\n     - Not a tie.\n   - **Row 7**: Team 1 (alumina) vs. Team 2 (ba\u0161kimi), agg: 2 - 4\n     - Not a tie.\n   - **Row 8**: Team 1 (cementarnica) vs. Team 2 (mad\u017eari solidarnost), agg: 8 - 0\n     - Not a tie.\n\n5. **Count the Teams with Ties**:\n   - From the analysis, two matches ended in aggregate ties: \n     - Row 2: pelister and sileks\n     - Row 5: karaorman and borec mhk\n\n6. **Determine Unique Teams Involved**:\n   - The teams involved in these ties are: pelister, sileks, karaorman, and borec mhk.\n   - This gives us four unique teams across two tie matches.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: \n   - The claim mentions \"2 team of football\" having aggregate ties, but we found four teams involved in such scenarios.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We examined each row for aggregate scores that were tied.
