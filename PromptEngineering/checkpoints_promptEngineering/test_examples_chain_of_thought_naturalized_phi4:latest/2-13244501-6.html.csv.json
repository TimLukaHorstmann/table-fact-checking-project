    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze the table for specific attendance values and corresponding records.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Records:**\n   - The record \"25 - 21 - 8\" is found in Row 7.\n   - The record \"25 - 20 - 8\" is found in Row 6.\n\n2. **Check Attendance for Record \"25 - 21 - 8\":**\n   - In Row 7, the attendance is 3069.\n\n3. **Determine if this is the Lowest Attendance:**\n   - Compare this with attendances from all other rows:\n     - Row 1: 6386\n     - Row 2: 14646\n     - Row 3: 14646\n     - Row 4: 14026\n     - Row 5: 13112\n     - Row 6: 15154 (record \"25 - 20 - 8\")\n     - Row 7: 3069 (record \"25 - 21 - 8\")\n     - Row 8: 9867\n     - Row 9: 17250\n     - Row 10: 9198\n     - Row 11: 14392\n     - Row 12: 14418\n     - Row 13: 9115\n\n   - The lowest attendance is indeed 3069 in Row 7, corresponding to the record \"25 - 21 - 8\".\n\n4. **Check Attendance for Record \"25 - 20 - 8\":**\n   - In Row 6, the attendance is 15154.\n\n5. **Determine if this is the Highest Attendance:**\n   - Compare this with attendances from all other rows:\n     - Row 1: 6386\n     - Row 2: 14646\n     - Row 3: 14646\n     - Row 4: 14026\n     - Row 5: 13112\n     - Row 6: 15154 (record \"25 - 20 - 8\")\n     - Row 7: 3069\n     - Row 8: 9867\n     - Row 9: 17250\n     - Row 10: 9198\n     - Row 11: 14392\n     - Row 12: 14418\n     - Row 13: 9115\n\n   - The highest attendance is 17250 in Row 9, not 15154. Therefore, the claim about the highest attendance being 15154 when the record was \"25 - 20 - 8\" is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false because while the lowest attendance of 3069 corresponds to the record \"25 - 21 - 8\", the highest attendance is not 15154; it is actually 17250. Therefore, only part of the claim is correct.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Identify records '25 - 21 - 8' and '25 - 20 - 8'.\\n2.
