The correct title is \"flying solo.\"\n   - Therefore, the claim as stated (\"michael lembeck direct series number 39 , fly solo\") is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 13, Column \"series\": series: 39\n- Row 13, Column \"directed by\": directed by :: michael lembeck\n- Row 13, Column \"title\": title: flying solo\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"series number 39 be write by michael lembeck\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Series Number**: The claim refers to series number 39.\n\n2. **Locate the Corresponding Row**: From the table, find the row where `series` is equal to 39. According to the table:\n   - Row 13 corresponds to `series: 39`.\n\n3. **Check the Writer Information**: Examine the \"written by\" field in Row 13.\n   - The entry for series number 39 (Row 13) shows it was written by `leslie rieder`.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**: The claim states that Michael Lembeck wrote series number 39. However, the table indicates that Leslie Rieder is credited as the writer.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since Michael Lembeck did not write series number 39, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, we will format this reasoning into a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the series number from the claim, which is 39.\",\n    \"Locate Row 13 in the table where `series: 39` is listed.\",\n    \"Check the 'written by' column for Row 13 to find the writer's name.\",\n    \"The writer for series 39 is Leslie Rieder, not Michael Lembeck.\",\n    \"Since Michael Lembeck did not write series number 39, the claim is FALSE.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"written by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
