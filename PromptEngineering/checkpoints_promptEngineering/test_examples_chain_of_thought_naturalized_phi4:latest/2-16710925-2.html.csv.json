    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, let's analyze it step-by-step using the given data:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Claim\n\nThe claim states:\n- \"week 14 be on september 26, 1971\"\n- \"the attendance be 57895\"\n\nWe need to verify both parts of this claim against the table.\n\n### Step 2: Check Week 14 Date\n\n- According to Row 14 in the table, week 14 is listed as having a date of December 19, 1971.\n- The claim states that week 14 should be on September 26, 1971. \n\n**Conclusion for Part 1:** The date does not match. Week 14 is actually on December 19, 1971, not September 26, 1971.\n\n### Step 3: Check Attendance for Week 14\n\n- According to Row 14 in the table, the attendance for week 14 is listed as 75954.\n- The claim states that the attendance should be 57895.\n\n**Conclusion for Part 2:** The attendance does not match. Week 14 has an attendance of 75954, not 57895.\n\n### Step 4: Cross-Verification with September 26, 1971\n\nTo ensure there's no confusion:\n- According to Row 2 in the table, the date September 26, 1971, corresponds to week 2.\n- The attendance for this date is indeed 57895.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim incorrectly associates the details of Week 2 with Week 14.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBoth parts of the claim are incorrect when compared to the data in the table. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the output in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that week 14 should be on September 26, 1971, and have an attendance of 57895.
