    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Steve Stricker of United States has the lowest score among all the players\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the scores listed in the table for each player and identify if Steve Stricker indeed has the lowest total score.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Steve Stricker's Score:**\n   - According to Row 1, Steve Stricker's score is \\(70 + 69 = 139\\).\n\n2. **Examine Other Players' Scores:**\n   - Compare Steve Stricker's score with the scores of all other players listed in the table.\n   \n3. **Row-by-Row Comparison:**\n   - **Row 2:** Colin Montgomerie has a score of \\(69 + 71 = 140\\).\n   - **Row 3:** Kenneth Ferrie has a score of \\(71 + 70 = 141\\).\n   - **Row 4:** Geoff Ogilvy has a score of \\(71 + 70 = 141\\).\n   - **Row 5:** Jim Furyk has a score of \\(70 + 72 = 142\\).\n   - **Row 6:** P\u00e1draig Harrington has a score of \\(70 + 72 = 142\\).\n   - **Row 7:** Jason Dufner has a score of \\(72 + 71 = 143\\).\n   - **Row 8:** Graeme McDowell has a score of \\(71 + 72 = 143\\).\n   - **Row 9:** Phil Mickelson has a score of \\(70 + 73 = 143\\).\n   - **Row 10:** Arron Oberholser has a score of \\(75 + 68 = 143\\).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Steve Stricker's score of 139 is lower than all other players' scores in the table (140, 141, 142, and 143).\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - The claim states that Steve Stricker has the lowest score among all players.\n   - Based on our comparison, Steve Stricker indeed has the lowest total score.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Steve Stricker's score is 139 as per Row 1.
