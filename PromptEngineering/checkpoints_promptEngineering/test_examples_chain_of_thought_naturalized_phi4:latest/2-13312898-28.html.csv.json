    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"there be 3 run back position pick by the 6th round\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table for any players picked with the position of \"running back.\" We will examine each row up to and including the 6th round to see if there are three such picks.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Rounds**: The claim specifies rounds up to and including the 6th round.\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: \n     - Round: 1\n     - Position: running back\n     - This is a valid pick for our criteria.\n   - **Row 2**: \n     - Round: 1\n     - Position: cornerback\n     - Not a running back, so it doesn't count.\n   - **Row 3**: \n     - Round: 2\n     - Position: center\n     - Not a running back, so it doesn't count.\n   - **Row 4**: \n     - Round: 2\n     - Position: offensive tackle\n     - Not a running back, so it doesn't count.\n   - **Row 5**: \n     - Round: 4\n     - Position: wide receiver\n     - Not a running back, so it doesn't count.\n   - **Row 6**: \n     - Round: 6\n     - Position: center\n     - Not a running back, so it doesn't count.\n\n3. **Count Running Back Picks**:\n   - From the examination above, only Row 1 has a \"running back\" position pick by the 6th round.\n   - Total running back picks in rounds 1 to 6: 1\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The claim states there should be three running back picks by the 6th round, but we found only one.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was examined for players with the position 'running back' in rounds 1 through 6. Only one such player (Row 1) was identified, which is less than the three specified in the claim.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
