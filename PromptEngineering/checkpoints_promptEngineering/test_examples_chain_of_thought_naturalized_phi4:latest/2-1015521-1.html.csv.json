From the provided data:\n     - Row 15 corresponds to \"Bell 212 Twin Huey\".\n\n2. **Check Type Information**:\n   - In Row 15, find the column labeled \"type\". According to the table, the type is listed as \"transport / utility\".\n\n3. **Evaluate Against Claim**:\n   - The claim states that \"the aircraft Bell 212 Twin Huey be a trainer type\".\n   - Compare this with the information from the table: \n     - The type for Bell 212 Twin Huey is \"transport / utility\", not \"trainer\".\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the type listed in the table does not match the claim of being a \"trainer type\", the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 15, Column: Type\n\nNow, let's format this into the required JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Locate 'Bell 212 Twin Huey' in the table (Row 15). 2. Check the type column for this row, which is 'transport / utility'. 3. Compare with claim stating it's a 'trainer type'. 4.
