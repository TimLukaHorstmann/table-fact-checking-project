We need to check all rows with dates in July and count them.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row:**\n   - Row 1: Date is July 1\n   - Row 2: Date is July 2\n   - Row 3: Date is July 3\n   - Row 4: Date is July 4\n   - Row 5: Date is July 5\n   - Row 6: Date is July 6\n   - Row 7: Date is July 7\n   - Row 8: Date is July 8\n   - Row 9: Date is July 12\n   - Row 10: Date is July 13\n   - Row 11: Date is July 14\n   - Row 12: Date is July 15\n   - Row 13: Date is July 16\n   - Row 14: Date is July 17\n   - Row 15: Date is July 18\n   - Row 16: Date is July 19\n   - Row 17: Date is July 20\n   - Row 18: Date is July 21\n   - Row 19: Date is July 22\n   - Row 20: Date is July 23\n   - Row 21: Date is July 23 (Note that this is still in July)\n   - Row 22: Date is July 24\n   - Row 23: Date is July 25\n   - Row 24: Date is July 27\n   - Row 25: Date is July 28\n   - Row 26: Date is July 29\n   - Row 27: Date is July 30\n   - Row 28: Date is July 31\n\n3. **Count the Games:**  \n   Each row corresponds to a game played in July, from rows 1 through 28.\n\n4. **Verification of Total Count:**  \n   Since all 28 rows are accounted for and each represents a unique date in July where a game was played, there are indeed 28 games played by the Blue Jays in that month.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**  \n   The table confirms the claim that the Blue Jays played a total of 28 games in July.\n\n**Relevant cells:**\n\n- All rows from 1 to 28 are relevant since each row represents a game played on a unique date in July.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the time frame as July and consider all dates within this period.\",\n    \"Examine each row to determine if it falls in July.\",\n    \"Count the number of games (rows) with dates in July, which are rows 1 through 28.\",\n    \"Verify that there are indeed 28 distinct game entries for July.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
