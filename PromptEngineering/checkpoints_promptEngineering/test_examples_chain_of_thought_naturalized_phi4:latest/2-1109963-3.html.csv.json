Since it is exactly 45, it does not satisfy the condition of being more than 45.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - There are no other instances in the table where the performance is 60.73 meters.\n   - Therefore, there is no year where both conditions (performance = 60.73 m and age > 45) are met.\n\nSince we found that the condition of having an age greater than 45 with a performance of 60.73 meters does not occur in any row, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify rows where performance is exactly 60.73 m.
