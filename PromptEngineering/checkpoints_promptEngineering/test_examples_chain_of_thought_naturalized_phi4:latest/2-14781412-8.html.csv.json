    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the equestrian events at the Asian Games occurring every four years from 1982 to 2010, except for 1990, is true or false, we need to examine the table data step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the Years of the Events:**\n   - From the table, list all the years when the equestrian events occurred:\n     - Row 1: Year = 1982\n     - Row 2: Year = 1986\n     - Row 3: Year = 1994\n     - Row 4: Year = 1998\n     - Row 5: Year = 2002\n     - Row 6: Year = 2006\n     - Row 7: Year = 2010\n\n2. **Calculate the Intervals Between Events:**\n   - Calculate the intervals between consecutive events:\n     - From 1982 to 1986: \\(1986 - 1982 = 4\\) years\n     - From 1986 to 1994: \\(1994 - 1986 = 8\\) years\n     - From 1994 to 1998: \\(1998 - 1994 = 4\\) years\n     - From 1998 to 2002: \\(2002 - 1998 = 4\\) years\n     - From 2002 to 2006: \\(2006 - 2002 = 4\\) years\n     - From 2006 to 2010: \\(2010 - 2006 = 4\\) years\n\n3. **Check for Consistency with the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the events occur every four years, except for 1990.\n   - We observe a deviation in the interval between 1986 and 1994, which is 8 years. This confirms there was no event in 1990 as stated in the claim.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The intervals are mostly consistent with a four-year cycle, except for the gap from 1986 to 1994.\n   - The absence of an event in 1990 aligns with the observed eight-year interval between 1986 and 1994.\n\nThus, based on the analysis of the table data, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the years from the table: 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010.\",\n    \"Calculate the intervals between consecutive events: 4 years (1982 to 1986), 8 years (1986 to 1994), 4 years (1994 to 1998), 4 years (1998 to 2002), 4 years (2002 to 2006), and 4 years (2006 to 2010).\",\n    \"The claim states events occur every four years except for 1990.\",\n    \"The eight-year gap between 1986 and 1994 confirms no event in 1990, supporting the claim.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, let's analyze it step-by-step:\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"Equestrian at the Asian Games have been located in a different city every year that it occurs except 1994 and 1998.\"\n\nThis means we need to check if each year listed corresponds to a unique location, with exceptions allowed for the years 1994 and 1998.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Unique Locations:**\n   - We will examine each row of the table to see if the 'location' is unique across all years except potentially 1994 and 1998.\n\n2. **Check Each Year:**\n   - Row 1 (1982): New Delhi\n   - Row 2 (1986): Seoul\n   - Row 3 (1994): Hiroshima\n   - Row 4 (1998): Bangkok\n   - Row 5 (2002): Busan\n   - Row 6 (2006): Doha\n   - Row 7 (2010): Guangzhou\n\n3. **Verify Uniqueness:**\n   - New Delhi, Seoul, Hiroshima, Bangkok, Busan, Doha, and Guangzhou are all distinct locations.\n   - There are no repeated locations for any year except potentially the years mentioned in the claim.\n\n4. **Examine Exceptions (1994 and 1998):**\n   - The claim allows exceptions for the years 1994 and 1998. We need to ensure that these two years do not have the same location as any other year.\n   - Hiroshima (1994) and Bangkok (1998) are unique compared to all other locations.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Each year has a different location, with no exceptions needed beyond what is allowed by the claim for 1994 and 1998.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe claim is TRUE because each year corresponds to a unique city, except where exceptions are explicitly allowed (1994 and 1998), which do not overlap with any other years in terms of location.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Each year listed in the table has a distinct location.
