    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Jon Sherman wrote the highest number of episodes\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data for each episode's writer(s). We'll count how many times Jon Sherman is listed as a writer.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Columns:**\n   - The relevant column for this task is \"written by,\" which contains information about the writers of each episode.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row in the Table:**\n   - We will go through each row to see if Jon Sherman's name appears in the \"written by\" column.\n\n3. **Count Occurrences:**\n   - **Row 1:** Written by Andrew Lenchewski. (Jon Sherman not listed)\n   - **Row 2:** Written by Michael Rauch. (Jon Sherman not listed)\n   - **Row 3:** Written by Constance M Burge & Jack Bernstein. (Jon Sherman not listed)\n   - **Row 4:** Written by Carol Flint & Jon Sherman. (Jon Sherman listed once)\n   - **Row 5:** Written by Michael Rauch & Jessica Ball. (Jon Sherman not listed)\n   - **Row 6:** Written by Constance M Burge. (Jon Sherman not listed)\n   - **Row 7:** Written by Carol Flint. (Jon Sherman not listed)\n   - **Row 8:** Written by Jon Sherman. (Jon Sherman listed once)\n   - **Row 9:** Written by Andrew Lenchewski & Jeff Drayer. (Jon Sherman not listed)\n   - **Row 10:** Written by Michael Rauch & Jon Sherman. (Jon Sherman listed once)\n   - **Row 11:** No entry for Row 57, so it is skipped.\n   - **Row 12:** Written by Jessica Ball & Aubrey Karr. (Jon Sherman not listed)\n\n4. **Total Count:**\n   - Jon Sherman is mentioned as a writer in Rows 4, 8, and 10.\n\n5. **Compare with Other Writers:**\n   - We need to check if any other writer appears more frequently than Jon Sherman.\n   - **Andrew Lenchewski:** Appears in Rows 1 and 9 (2 times).\n   - **Michael Rauch:** Appears in Rows 2 and 5, also co-written Row 10 (3 times total including co-writing).\n   - **Constance M Burge:** Appears in Rows 3 and 6 (2 times).\n   - **Carol Flint:** Appears in Rows 4 and 7 (2 times).\n   - **Jessica Ball:** Appears in Rows 5 and 12 (2 times).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Jon Sherman appears as a writer in 3 episodes.\n   - Michael Rauch, when counting co-writes, also appears in 3 episodes.\n\nSince no single writer has more credited appearances than Jon Sherman or Michael Rauch, the claim that \"Jon Sherman wrote the highest number of episodes\" is false because he does not have more credits than others like Michael Rauch when considering both sole and co-writing roles.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Counted occurrences of each writer in the 'written by' column.
