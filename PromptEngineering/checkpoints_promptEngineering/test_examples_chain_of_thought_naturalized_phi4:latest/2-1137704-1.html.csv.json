    "resp": "To determine if there are three entrants with the \"Ferrari 038 305 V12\" engine, let's analyze the given information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: We need to look for entries that mention an engine similar to \"Ferrari 038 305 V12.\" The closest match in the data provided is \"ferrari 038 3.5 v12.\"\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - Look through each row for mentions of the \"ferrari 038 3.5 v12\" engine.\n   - Note down any rows where this engine appears.\n\n3. **Count Occurrences**: Count how many unique entrants (rows) use the \"ferrari 038 3.5 v12\" engine.\n\n4. **Cross-Reference Entries**:\n   - Check if multiple drivers in a single row are counted as separate entrants or just one.\n   - Ensure that each unique entrant is only counted once, even if they have multiple drivers.\n\n5. **Determine the Answer**: Compare the count of unique entrants with three to confirm if there are indeed three entrants using this engine.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n- **Row 30**: \n  - Constructor: Scuderia Ferrari\n  - Engine: ferrari 038 3.5 v12\n  - Drivers: Jean Alesi (all rounds)\n\n- **Row 31**:\n  - Constructor: Scuderia Ferrari\n  - Engine: ferrari 038 3.5 v12\n  - Drivers: Ivan Capelli (rounds 1-14)\n\n- **Row 32**:\n  - Constructor: Scuderia Ferrari\n  - Engine: ferrari 038 3.5 v12\n  - Driver: Nicola Larini (rounds 15-16)\n\nFrom the analysis:\n\n- Rows 30, 31, and 32 all list \"ferrari 038 3.5 v12\" as their engine.\n- Each row represents a unique entrant since they are distinct rows with different driver configurations or round specifications.\n\nThus, there are three unique entrants using the \"ferrari 038 3.5 v12\" engine.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified rows with 'ferrari 038 3.5 v12' engine: Rows 30, 31, and 32. Each row represents a unique entrant based on different driver configurations or rounds, confirming three distinct entrants.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"engine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"engine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"engine\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
