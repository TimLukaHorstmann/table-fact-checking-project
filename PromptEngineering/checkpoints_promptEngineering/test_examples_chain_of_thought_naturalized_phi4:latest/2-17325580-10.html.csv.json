    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"game 75 - 82 take place in the month of March\" is true or false, we need to examine the dates for games 75 through 82 as provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Date Column:**\n   The date column provides information about when each game took place.\n\n2. **Examine Each Game's Date:**\n\n   - **Game 75:** \n     - Date: April 2\n     - Conclusion: This game is in April, not March.\n   \n   - **Game 76:** \n     - Date: April 3\n     - Conclusion: This game is also in April.\n\n   - **Game 77:** \n     - Date: April 5\n     - Conclusion: This game occurs in April.\n\n   - **Game 78:** \n     - Date: April 8\n     - Conclusion: The date indicates it's in April.\n   \n   - **Game 79:** \n     - Date: April 10\n     - Conclusion: Held in April.\n\n   - **Game 80:** \n     - Date: April 12\n     - Conclusion: Takes place in April.\n\n   - **Game 81:** \n     - Date: April 13\n     - Conclusion: This game is also in April.\n   \n   - **Game 82:** \n     - Date: April 15\n     - Conclusion: The date shows it happened in April.\n\n3. **Conclusion on the Claim:**\n   All games from 75 to 82 took place in April, not March.
