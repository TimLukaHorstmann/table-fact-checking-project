    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"there be 2 successor in congress between 1855 and 1857\" is true or false, we need to carefully examine each row of the table for the relevant dates and conditions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: We are looking for successors who were formally installed into Congress during the period from 1855 to 1857.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1: New Hampshire**\n     - Successor: John Parker Hale (R)\n     - Date of Formal Installation: July 30, 1855\n     - This date falls within the range 1855-1857.\n   \n   - **Row 2: Alabama**\n     - Successor: Benjamin Fitzpatrick (D)\n     - Date of Formal Installation: November 26, 1855\n     - This date also falls within the specified range.\n\n3. **Count the Relevant Successors**:\n   - We have identified two successors installed in Congress during this period:\n     - John Parker Hale (July 30, 1855)\n     - Benjamin Fitzpatrick (November 26, 1855)\n\n4. **Verify with Remaining Rows**:\n   - **Row 3: Pennsylvania**\n     - Successor: William Bigler (D)\n     - Date of Formal Installation: January 14, 1856\n     - This is within the range but adds a third successor.\n   \n   - **Row 4: California**\n     - Successor: William M. Gwin (D)\n     - Date of Formal Installation: January 13, 1857\n     - This date is also within the range, adding a fourth successor.\n   \n   - **Row 5: Indiana**\n     - Successor: Graham N. Fitch (D)\n     - Date of Formal Installation: February 4, 1857\n     - This falls within the range, adding a fifth successor.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The claim states there are \"2 successors\" in Congress between 1855 and 1857. However, we have identified five successors installed during this period. Therefore, the claim is false as it underestimates the number of successors.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires identifying successors formally installed into Congress from 1855 to 1857. Upon examining each row, we found that five successors (John Parker Hale, Benjamin Fitzpatrick, William Bigler, William M. Gwin, and Graham N. Fitch) were installed within this period. Therefore, the claim of having only two successors is incorrect.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
