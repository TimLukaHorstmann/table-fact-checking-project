    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"erin district high school have the lowest enrollment with 649\" is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Enrollment for Erin District High School:**\n   - According to Row 5 of the table, the enrollment for Erin District High School is 616.\n\n2. **Compare Enrollments Across All Schools:**\n   - We must check each row in the table to find all enrollment numbers and identify the lowest one.\n   \n3. **List of Enrollment Numbers:**\n   - Centennial Collegiate Vocational Institute (Row 1): 1533\n   - Centre Dufferin District High School (Row 2): 998\n   - Centre Wellington District High School (Row 3): 1459\n   - College Heights Secondary School (Row 4): 649\n   - Erin District High School (Row 5): 616\n   - Guelph Collegiate Vocational Institute (Row 6): 1314\n   - John F. Ross Collegiate Vocational Institute (Row 7): 1895\n   - Norwell District Secondary School (Row 8): 795\n   - Orangeville District Secondary School (Row 9): 1574\n   - Wellington Heights Secondary School (Row 10): 680\n   - Westside Secondary School (Row 11): 996\n\n4. **Identify the Lowest Enrollment:**\n   - Among all the enrollment numbers listed, the lowest is 616 for Erin District High School.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Erin District High School has the lowest enrollment with 649.\n   - From our comparison, we see that Erin District High School actually has an enrollment of 616, which is lower than 649. Additionally, College Heights Secondary School has an enrollment of 649.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is false because Erin District High School does have the lowest enrollment, but it's not 649; it's 616. Moreover, another school (College Heights) has exactly 649 enrollments.\n\nBased on this reasoning:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The enrollment for Erin District High School is 616.
