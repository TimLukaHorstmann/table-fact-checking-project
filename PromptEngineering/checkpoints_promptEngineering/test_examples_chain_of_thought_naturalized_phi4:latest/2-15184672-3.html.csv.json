    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim about the table, we'll break down the process into steps:\n\n1. **Identify Time Slots:** The claim specifies two time slots: 7:00 and 8:30.\n2. **Locate 7:00 Slot in Row 2:** According to the claim, \"Wheel of Fortune\" should be on at 7:00 on a particular channel. In Row 2 of the table, at the 7:00 time slot, we have \"wheel of fortune.\" This matches the first part of the claim.\n3. **Locate 8:30 Slot in Row 2:** The claim also states that \"Jeopardy!\" should be on at 8:30 on the same channel. In Row 2, at the 8:30 time slot, we have \"costello.\" This does not match \"jeopardy!,\" thus contradicting the second part of the claim.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since one part of the claim is true and the other is false, the entire claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells in the table for this analysis:\n- Row 2 at 7:00 column (matches \"wheel of fortune\")\n- Row 2 at 8:30 column (does not match \"jeopardy!\")\n\nNow, let's structure this reasoning into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.

At 8:30 in Row 2, 'costello' appears instead of 'jeopardy!', contradicting the second part of the claim. \\n4. Since one condition of the claim is false, the entire claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"7:00\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"8:30\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
