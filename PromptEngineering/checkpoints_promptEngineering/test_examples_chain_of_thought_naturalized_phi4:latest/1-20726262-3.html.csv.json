We need to find where this production code appears in the table.\n   - From Row 11, we see that the production code is indeed `2wab12`.\n\n2. **Determine the Season Number for Production Code `2wab12`:**\n   - In Row 11, the column \"no in season\" indicates that this episode is numbered as 12 within its season.\n\n3. **Verify if it Corresponds to Season Number 12:**\n   - The claim states that production code `2wab12` should be given for \"season number 12.\"\n   - However, from Row 11, we see that while the episode number in the season is 12 (`no in season: 12`), there is no direct indication of it being part of \"Season 12\" overall. Instead, this data suggests it is part of a different season sequence.\n\n4. **Cross-reference with Other Seasons and Episodes:**\n   - The table shows that episodes are numbered sequentially from `1` to `10` for Season 2 (based on the production codes starting from `2wab01` to `2wab10`). This implies that the missing episode number `24` is likely part of Season 2, making `25` and onwards also part of Season 2.\n   - Hence, Row 11 corresponds to a continuation within Season 2.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The production code `2wab12` belongs to an episode that is the 12th in its season sequence, but this does not mean it is \"Season Number 12.\" It appears to be part of Season 2 based on the continuity of numbering and existing entries.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- **Chain of Thought:**\n  - The production code `2wab12` corresponds to an episode numbered as 12 within its season (Row 11).\n  - There is no indication that this production code belongs to a \"Season Number 12.\"\n  - Production codes and season numbering indicate it is part of Season 2.\n\n- **Answer:** FALSE\n\n- **Relevant Cells:**\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"The production code 2wab12 corresponds to an episode numbered as 12 within its season (Row 11).
