Here, Bada's value is listed as 0.05%.\n   - **Row 6**: The source is Statcounter Global Stats, also dated July - 13, with a browsing method. In this row, Bada has a different value of 4.64%.\n\n3. **Determine the Correctness:**\n   - Since both rows (5 and 6) pertain to the same date (July - 13), we must acknowledge that they provide differing values for Bada.\n   - The claim specifically mentions a value of 0.05% for Bada on July - 13, which matches the data from Row 5.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given that there is at least one source (Net Market Share) reporting Bada as having a value of 0.05% in July - 13, the claim is supported by this entry.\n   - Despite the discrepancy with another source (Statcounter Global Stats), the claim does not assert exclusivity; it only states a specific value found in the data.\n\nThus, the claim \"Bada have a value of 0.05% on July - 13\" is TRUE based on the information from Row 5.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim about Bada's market share in July - 13 being 0.05%, I examined rows with this date.
