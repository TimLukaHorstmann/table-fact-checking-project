    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Phyllis Nelson make the US Hot 100 2 time\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data focusing on entries related to Phyllis Nelson's singles and their respective positions on the US Hot 100 chart.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - We are looking for rows where \"single\" represents a song by Phyllis Nelson.\n   - The relevant columns are \"single\" (to identify songs) and \"us hot 100\" (to check chart positions).\n\n2. **Examine Each Row:**\n   - **Row 1:** Single is \"don't stop the train,\" and \"us hot 100\" is \"-\". This entry does not appear on the US Hot 100.\n   - **Row 2:** Single is \"move closer,\" and \"us hot 100\" is \"-\". This entry also did not chart on the US Hot 100.\n   - **Row 3:** Single is \"i don't know,\" with a position of \"61\" in \"us hot 100.\" This song appeared on the US Hot 100 once.\n   - **Row 4:** Single is \"i like you,\" also with a position of \"61\" in \"us hot 100.\" This song appears again, matching the chart entry from Row 3. It indicates it is another instance where this single reached the same position but does not count as an additional unique entry on the Hot 100.\n   - **Row 5:** Single is \"move closer (re-issue),\" and \"us hot 100\" is \"-\". This re-issue did not chart.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Phyllis Nelson's singles appeared in the US Hot 100 only once based on unique entries (\"i don't know\" at position 61).\n   - Despite two rows showing a song with the same chart position, they refer to the same single entry \"i like you,\" which is essentially the same as \"i don't know\" due to the identical chart information.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe claim that Phyllis Nelson made it to the US Hot 100 twice is false.
