    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the Green Party losing a percentage of the popular vote from 2004 to 2006 is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - We need to compare the percentage of the popular vote for two specific years: 2004 and 2006.\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 6 corresponds to the year 2004.\n     - Row 7 corresponds to the year 2006.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Data:**\n   - For the election in 2004 (Row 6):\n     - Percentage of popular vote = 4.32%\n   - For the election in 2006 (Row 7):\n     - Percentage of popular vote = 4.48%\n\n3. **Compare the Percentages:**\n   - Compare the percentage of popular votes between 2004 and 2006:\n     - In 2004, it was 4.32%.\n     - In 2006, it increased to 4.48%.\n\n4. **Determine if There Was a Loss or Gain:**\n   - Since 4.48% (in 2006) is greater than 4.32% (in 2004), there was an increase in the percentage of the popular vote, not a decrease.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that the Green Party lost a percentage of the popular vote from 2004 to 2006.\n   - Based on our comparison, this is false because the percentage actually increased.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify relevant rows for 2004 and 2006. Extract the percentage of popular votes for these years (4.32% for 2004 and 4.48% for 2006). Compare the percentages to determine if there was a loss or gain. Since the vote increased from 4.32% to 4.48%, the claim that the Green Party lost a percentage is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"% of popular vote\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"% of popular vote\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
