    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Kostaq Kota's term start date being after Pandeli Evangjeli's term end date is true, we need to carefully analyze the relevant information from the table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - Find the term start date for Kostaq Kota during his second time as prime minister.\n   - Find the term end date for Pandeli Evangjeli during his second time as prime minister.\n\n2. **Extract Data from the Table:**\n   - From Row 5, we see that Kostaq Kota's term start on his second time is \"9 november 1936.\"\n   - From Row 3, we find that Pandeli Evangjeli's term end date during his second time is \"16 october 1935.\"\n\n3. **Compare Dates:**\n   - Compare the two dates to determine if Kostaq Kota's term start (9 November 1936) comes after Pandeli Evangjeli's term end (16 October 1935).\n\n4. **Determine the Truth of the Claim:**\n   - Since 9 November 1936 is indeed after 16 October 1935, the claim that Kostaq Kota's term start on 9 November 1936 was after Pandeli Evangjeli's term end is true.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the term start date for Kostaq Kota during his second time: 9 November 1936.\",\n    \"Identify the term end date for Pandeli Evangjeli during his second time: 16 October 1935.\",\n    \"Compare these dates to see if 9 November 1936 is after 16 October 1935.\",\n    \"Since 9 November 1936 comes after 16 October 1935, the claim is true.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"term start\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"term end\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the only 1st time minister of Albania be Pandeli Evangjeli\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze each entry in the table for details about the first-time tenure of each prime minister listed.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Prime Ministers and Their First-Time Tenure:**\n   - We are interested in checking if there were any other first-time ministers besides Pandeli Evangjeli.\n   \n2. **Row Analysis:**\n\n   - **Row 2 (Kostaq Kota):**\n     - Name: Kostaq Kota\n     - Term Start: 5 September 1928\n     - This is marked as his \"1st time\" in the table, indicating that this was indeed a first-time tenure for Kostaq Kota.\n   \n   - **Row 3 (Pandeli Evangjeli):**\n     - Name: Pandeli Evangjeli\n     - Term Start: 6 March 1930\n     - This is marked as his \"2nd time,\" meaning he had previously served before this term. Thus, this was not his first tenure.\n   \n   - **Row 4 (Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri):**\n     - Name: Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri\n     - Term Start: 22 October 1935\n     - This is marked as his \"1st time,\" indicating that this was his first term as prime minister.\n   \n   - **Row 5 (Kostaq Kota, second tenure):**\n     - Name: Kostaq Kota\n     - Term Start: 9 November 1936\n     - This is not a first-time tenure since it's the second time listed for him.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n\n   - Pandeli Evangjeli was not a first-time minister during his term from 6 March 1930 to 16 October 1935, as he had already served before.\n   - Kostaq Kota and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri both have entries marked as their \"1st time,\" indicating they were also first-time ministers at some point.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Pandeli Evangjeli was not a first-time minister during his second term, and there were other first-time ministers such as Kostaq Kota and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Kostaq Kota and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri both served as prime ministers for the first time according to their entries marked '1st time.'
