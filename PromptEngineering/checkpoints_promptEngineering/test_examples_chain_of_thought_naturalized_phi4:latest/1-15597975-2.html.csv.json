    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding Brian Rafuse's points for (pf), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**  \n   The claim pertains to \"brian rafuse,\" so we need to find the row in the table where the skip is listed as \"brian rafuse.\" According to the table, this is Row 10.\n\n2. **Locate the Points For (pf) Column for Brian Rafuse:**  \n   Once we have identified Row 10, we look at the value under the column labeled \"pf\" in that row.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim Against the Table Value:**  \n   The claim states that Brian Rafuse's pf is 60. We will compare this with the actual value present in the table for that specific cell.\n\n4. **Conclude Based on Comparison:**\n   - If the table shows \"pf\" as 60 for Row 10, then the claim is TRUE.\n   - Otherwise, if it shows any other number, the claim is FALSE.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- **Step 1:** From the table, we locate that Row 10 corresponds to Brian Rafuse (skip: brian rafuse).\n  \n- **Step 2:** In Row 10, look at the \"pf\" column. The value listed is 60.\n\n- **Step 3:** Compare this with the claim which states \"brian rafuse's pf be 60.\" Since both are 60, they match exactly.\n\n- **Step 4:** Conclude that since the table confirms the value as 60, the claim is TRUE.\n\nFinally, we provide our conclusion in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Brian Rafuse's points for (pf) is 60.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"when the stolen end equal 5, the amount of pa be 86\" is true or false, we need to analyze each row in the table where the number of \"stolen ends\" equals 5 and check the corresponding value for \"pa.\"\n\nLet's go through the relevant rows step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Stolen Ends Equal to 5:**\n   - We need to find all entries in the table where the \"stolen ends\" column is equal to 5.\n\n2. **Check Corresponding PA Values:**\n   - For each row identified, check what the value of \"pa\" (points allowed) is.\n   \n3. **Determine if All PA Values are Equal to 86:**\n   - Verify whether every instance where stolen ends equals 5 has a corresponding pa value of 86.\n\nNow, let's perform these steps:\n\n- **Row 1:** Stolen ends = 11\n- **Row 2:** Stolen ends = 12\n- **Row 3:** Stolen ends = 22\n- **Row 4:** Stolen ends = 11\n- **Row 5:** Stolen ends = 14\n- **Row 6:** Stolen ends = 19\n- **Row 7:** Stolen ends = 15\n- **Row 8:** Stolen ends = 6\n- **Row 9:** Stolen ends = 7\n- **Row 10:** Stolen ends = 3\n- **Row 11:** Stolen ends = 5, pa = 86\n\nUpon reviewing the table, only Row 11 has stolen ends equal to 5.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Kevin Martin's pf be 89\" is true or false, we need to examine the table for Kevin Martin's statistics specifically regarding his points-for (pf) score.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Kevin Martin's Entry:**\n   - Locate the row corresponding to Kevin Martin in the table.\n   - According to the table, Kevin Martin is listed as the skip from Alberta in Row 1.\n\n2. **Extract Points-For (pf) Data for Kevin Martin:**\n   - Check the 'pf' column in Row 1 where Kevin Martin's data is recorded.\n   - The value of 'pf' for Kevin Martin is provided as 86.\n\n3. **Compare with Claimed Value:**\n   - The claim states that Kevin Martin\u2019s pf should be 89.\n   - We compare this claimed value (89) with the actual value from the table (86).\n\n4. **Determine the Veracity of the Claim:**\n   - Since 86 does not equal 89, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells for Reference:**\n   - The relevant cell in the table is Row 1 under the column 'pf'.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis above, Kevin Martin's points-for (pf) is 86, not 89 as claimed.
