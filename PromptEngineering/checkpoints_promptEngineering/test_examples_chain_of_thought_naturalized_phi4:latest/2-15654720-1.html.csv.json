    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"6 cash have earnings of 39380\" is true or false, let's analyze the table step-by-step.\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim suggests that there is a season where exactly 6 events resulted in cashes (qualifying for prize money) and those events earned a total of $39,380.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - We need to find rows where the number of \"cashes\" is 6.\n   - Then, check if the corresponding \"earnings\" for that row are $39,380.\n\n3. **Check Each Season**:\n   - **Row 1 (2002-03)**: Cashes = 6, Earnings = $9,500\n   - **Row 2 (2003-04)**: Cashes = 15, Earnings = $45,850\n   - **Row 3 (2004-05)**: Cashes = 19, Earnings = $56,675\n   - **Row 4 (2005-06)**: Cashes = 22, Earnings = $130,270\n   - **Row 5 (2006-07)**: Cashes = 20, Earnings = $148,425\n   - **Row 6 (2007-08)**: Cashes = 18, Earnings = $108,900\n   - **Row 7 (2008-09)**: Cashes = 18, Earnings = $174,680\n   - **Row 8 (2009-10)**: Cashes = 16, Earnings = $85,570\n   - **Row 9 (2010-11)**: Cashes = 9, Earnings = $33,690\n   - **Row 10 (2011-12)**: Cashes = 10, Earnings = $39,380\n   - **Row 11 (2012-13)**: Cashes = 10, Earnings = $113,259\n\n4. **Find the Matching Row**:\n   - The only row where \"cashes\" is 6 is Row 1 (2002-03).\n   - However, the earnings for this row are $9,500, not $39,380.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: There is no season in which exactly 6 cashes resulted in earnings of $39,380.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We checked each row to find where 'cashes' equals 6 and compared the corresponding 'earnings'.
