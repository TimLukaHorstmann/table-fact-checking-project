    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to evaluate two main aspects: whether there are companies incorporated in the Netherlands with a group's equity shareholding of 99% or very close to it, specifically 100%, and if any have \"flight academy\" as their principal activities.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Companies Incorporated in the Netherlands**:\n   - Review each row to find companies incorporated in the Netherlands.\n   \n2. **Check Equity Shareholding for These Companies**:\n   - For those identified in step 1, verify if any have a group's equity shareholding of 99% or as close as possible (e.g., 100%).\n\n3. **Verify Principal Activities**:\n   - From the list obtained in steps 1 and 2, check if \"flight academy\" is listed as one of the principal activities.\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n- **Row 2**: Company: cygnific; Type: subsidiary; Principal activities: sales and service; Incorporated in: Netherlands; Group's equity shareholding: 100%.\n  - *Not relevant* because the principal activity is not \"flight academy\".\n\n- **Row 3**: Company: epcor; Type: subsidiary; Principal activities: maintenance; Incorporated in: Netherlands; Group's equity shareholding: 100%.\n  - *Not relevant* because the principal activity is not \"flight academy\".\n\n- **Row 4**: Company: high speed alliance; Type: joint venture; Principal activities: high-speed trains; Incorporated in: Netherlands; Group's equity shareholding: 5% (10% voting right).\n  - *Not relevant* because the equity shareholding is not close to 99% or 100%.\n\n- **Row 7**: Company: klm catering services; Type: subsidiary; Principal activities: catering services; Incorporated in: Netherlands; Group's equity shareholding: 100%.\n  - *Not relevant* because the principal activity is not \"flight academy\".\n\n- **Row 8**: Company: klm cityhopper; Type: subsidiary; Principal activities: airline; Incorporated in: Netherlands; Group's equity shareholding: 100%.\n  - *Not relevant* because the principal activity is not \"flight academy\".\n\n- **Row 10**: Company: klm equipment services; Type: subsidiary; Principal activities: equipment support; Incorporated in: Netherlands; Group's equity shareholding: 100%.\n  - *Not relevant* because the principal activity is not \"flight academy\".\n\n- **Row 11**: Company: klm financial services; Type: subsidiary; Principal activities: financing; Incorporated in: Netherlands; Group's equity shareholding: 100%.\n  - *Not relevant* because the principal activity is not \"flight academy\".\n\n- **Row 12**: Company: klm flight academy; Type: subsidiary; Principal activities: flight academy; Incorporated in: Netherlands; Group's equity shareholding: 100%.\n  - *Relevant* because both criteria are met: incorporated in the Netherlands and has a principal activity of \"flight academy\" with an equity shareholding of 100%.\n\n- **Row 13**: Company: klm health services; Type: subsidiary; Principal activities: health services; Incorporated in: Netherlands; Group's equity shareholding: 100%.\n  - *Not relevant* because the principal activity is not \"flight academy\".\n\n- **Row 15**: Company: martinair; Type: subsidiary; Principal activities: cargo airline; Incorporated in: Netherlands; Group's equity shareholding: 100%.\n  - *Not relevant* because the principal activity is not \"flight academy\".\n\n- **Row 16**: Company: schiphol logistics park; Type: joint controlled entity; Principal activities: logistics; Incorporated in: Netherlands; Group's equity shareholding: 53% (45% voting right).\n  - *Not relevant* because the equity shareholding is significantly less than 99%.\n\n- **Row 17**: Company: transaviacom; Type: subsidiary; Principal activities: airline; Incorporated in: Netherlands; Group's equity shareholding: 100%.\n  - *Not relevant* because the principal activity is not \"flight academy\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that companies incorporated in the Netherlands have a group's equity shareholding of 99% and have \"flight academy\" as their principal activities. The only company meeting these criteria is **KLm flight academy** with an equity shareholding of 100%. Therefore, the statement can be considered TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified companies incorporated in Netherlands; verified equity shareholding and principal activities.
