    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"prop Steve Borthwick be Leicester's best known player in that position\" is TRUE or FALSE, we will analyze the given table based on relevant information.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Steve Borthwick\u2019s Information:**\n   - Locate the row corresponding to Steve Borthwick.\n   - According to Row 9, Steve Borthwick's position is \"lock\", not \"prop\".\n\n2. **Check for Players in Position 'Prop' from Leicester:**\n   - Identify players listed as \"prop\" in the table:\n     - Jason Hobson (Row 4)\n     - Tim Payne (Row 5)\n     - Andrew Sheridan (Row 6)\n     - Matt Stevens (Row 7)\n     - Phil Vickery (Row 41)\n   - Determine which of these players are associated with Leicester:\n     - None of the listed \"prop\" players are from Leicester based on their club information.\n\n3. **Conclusion Based on Analysis:**\n   - Since Steve Borthwick is a lock and not a prop, he cannot be considered as a prop player for any team.\n   - Additionally, there are no prop players associated with Leicester in the table.\n   - Therefore, it is impossible for Steve Borthwick to be Leicester's best-known player in the \"prop\" position.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim is FALSE because Steve Borthwick is not a prop and does not play for Leicester. Thus, he cannot be Leicester\u2019s best-known player in that position.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Steve Borthwick's position is 'lock', not 'prop'.
