    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"before March 6 Montreal be the visitor\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table for any instances where Montreal appears as the visitor before March 6.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Date Range:**\n   - The claim specifies \"before March 6,\" so we are interested in games that occurred on dates earlier than March 6.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row Before March 6:**\n   - We need to check each row in the table where the date is before March 6 to see if Montreal appears as the visitor.\n\n3. **Check Rows Individually:**\n   - **Row 1:** Date is March 1, Visitor is Philadelphia.\n   - **Row 2:** Date is March 2, Visitor is NY Rangers.\n   - **Row 3:** Date is March 4, Visitor is Philadelphia.\n   - **Row 4:** Date is March 6. This row is not \"before\" March 6, so it is excluded from consideration.\n\n4. **Determine if Montreal Appeared as Visitor:**\n   - From the examination above, there are no rows with a date before March 6 where the visitor is Montreal.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince Montreal does not appear as the visitor in any row before March 6, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires checking if Montreal was listed as the visitor on dates before March 6.
