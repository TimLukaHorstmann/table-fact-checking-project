We must identify which team corresponds to this name in the table.\n   \n2. **Locate Toronto Maple Leafs in the Table:**\n   - Check each row for the NHL team column to find entries related to the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\n3. **Examine Relevant Rows for Toronto Maple Leafs:**\n   - Row 9: The player is Dale Smedsmo, position is left wing, nationality is United States, NHL team is Toronto Maple Leafs, college/junior/club team is Bemidji State University (WCHA).\n   - Row 14: The player is Steve Johnson, position is defence, nationality is Canada, NHL team is Toronto Maple Leafs, college/junior/club team is Verdun Maple Leafs (QMJHL).\n\n4. **Verify College/Junior/Club Team and Nationality for Row 9:**\n   - The claim specifies a player from Bemidji State University (WCHA) drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n   - In Row 9, Dale Smedsmo fits this description: he is from Bemidji State University (WCHA) and was indeed drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\n5. **Check for Additional Conditions in the Claim:**\n   - The claim also specifies that the player should be from the United States.\n   - Dale Smedsmo, in Row 9, has his nationality listed as the United States, which matches this condition.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the information from Row 9, the claim is true because a player (Dale Smedsmo) from Bemidji State University (WCHA) and of U.S. nationality was indeed drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that the Toronto Maple Leafs drafted a player from Bemidji State University (WCHA) who is from the United States.
