    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"norman sisisky be re - elect after 1982\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the relevant information provided in the table about Norman Sisisky.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - We look for the row that mentions Norman Sisisky. According to the table:\n     - **Row 3** refers to \"district: virginia 4, incumbent: norman sisisky, party: democratic, first elected: 1982...\"\n\n2. **Check Election Results:**\n   - In Row 3, the column \"results\" states: \"re-elected\". This indicates that Norman Sisisky was re-elected after his initial election.\n\n3. **Verify Candidate Information:**\n   - The \"candidates\" information in Row 3 further supports this by stating \"norman sisisky (d) unopposed,\" which means he ran for re-election without any opposition and won, confirming his re-election status.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim specifically states that Norman Sisisky was \"re-elected after 1982.\" Since he was first elected in 1982 and then re-elected (as indicated by the table), this aligns with being re-elected \"after\" 1982.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the information from Row 3, it is clear that Norman Sisisky was indeed re-elected after his initial election in 1982.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Row 3 of the table indicates that Norman Sisisky, first elected in 1982, was re-elected as he ran unopposed and the results show 're-elected'.
