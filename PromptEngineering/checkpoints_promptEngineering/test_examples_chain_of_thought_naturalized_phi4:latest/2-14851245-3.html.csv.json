    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Ivana Abramovi\u0107 playing on a clay surface on both July 16, 2007, and September 24, 2007, is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the relevant parts of the table.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Dates:**\n   - We are interested in matches that occurred on July 16, 2007, and September 24, 2007.\n\n2. **Locate Rows with These Dates:**\n   - Search for rows where the \"date\" column matches either of these dates.\n\n3. **Check Surface Type for Each Date:**\n   - For each identified row, check the \"surface\" column to confirm if it is \"clay.\"\n\n4. **Verify Partner and Opponents:**\n   - Ensure that Ivana Abramovi\u0107 was indeed the partner in these matches as per the claim.\n\n5. **Compile Results:**\n   - Confirm both dates have \"clay\" as the surface type with Ivana Abramovi\u0107 as the partner.\n\n### Examination of Table:\n\n- **July 16, 2007:**\n  - Row 16 has the date \"16 - jul - 2007.\"\n  - The surface is listed as \"clay.\"\n  - The partner is \"maria abramovic.\"\n\n- **September 24, 2007:**\n  - Row 17 has the date \"24 - sep - 2007.\"\n  - The surface is listed as \"clay.\"\n  - The partner is \"maria abramovic.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBoth matches on July 16, 2007, and September 24, 2007, were played on a clay surface with Maria Abramovi\u0107 (note: the claim mentions Ivana Abramovi\u0107, but the table refers to Maria Abramovi\u0107) as the partner.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Ivana Abramovic played with Maria Abramovic only 1 time\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table for any instances where a player named Ivana Abramovic participated as a partner alongside Maria Abramovic.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure:** The table lists outcomes of tennis matches, including details such as date, tournament, surface, partners, opponents, and scores. Each row represents a different match.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Columns:** To verify the claim, we need to focus on two columns:\n   - `partner`: This column shows who partnered with the player in each match.\n   - We also know from context that one of the players is Maria Abramovic, so we look for her name as a partner.\n\n3. **Search for Matches Involving Maria Abramovic:**\n   - Go through each row to find entries where `partner` is \"maria abramovic.\"\n\n4. **Count Occurrences of Ivana Abramovic as Partner:**\n   - Check if there are any rows where the `partner` column lists \"ivana abramovic\" when playing with Maria Abramovic.\n\n5. **Analyze Each Relevant Row:**\n\n   - **Row 7:** partner is \"maria abramovic.\"\n   - **Row 8:** partner is \"stefanie haidner,\" not Ivana.\n   - **Row 9:** partner is \"maria abramovic.\"\n   - **Row 10:** partner is \"maria abramovic.\"\n   - **Row 11:** partner is \"alla kudryavtseva,\" not Ivana.\n   - **Row 12:** partner is \"aurelie vedy,\" not Ivana.\n   - **Row 13:** partner is \"maria abramovic.\"\n   - **Row 14:** partner is \"maria abramovic.\"\n   - **Row 15:** partner is \"hana sromova,\" not Ivana.\n   - **Row 16:** partner is \"maria abramovic.\"\n   - **Row 17:** partner is \"maria abramovic.\"\n   - **Row 18:** partner is \"maria abramovic.\"\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - In none of the rows where Maria Abramovic is a partner does it list Ivana Abramovic as her partner.\n   - Therefore, there are zero instances where Ivana Abramovic played with Maria Abramovic.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Checked each row for matches involving Maria Abramovic as a partner and found no instances of Ivana Abramovic being listed as a partner in those rows.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
