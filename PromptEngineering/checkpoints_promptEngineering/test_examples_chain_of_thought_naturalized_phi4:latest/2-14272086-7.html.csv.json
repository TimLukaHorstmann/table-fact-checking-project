We will analyze each part of the claim step by step using the data provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Losses by Blevins:**\n   - We need to find all instances where Blevins is listed as the losing pitcher.\n   \n2. **Check Against Angels:**\n   - Review the rows corresponding to games against the Angels and see if Blevins had a loss in any of these games.\n\n3. **Check Against White Sox:**\n   - Similarly, review the rows corresponding to games against the White Sox and check for any losses by Blevins.\n\n4. **Verify Dates:**\n   - Ensure that these games occurred in July 2008, as per the claim.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Row 19:** \n  - Date: July 25\n  - Opponent: Athletics\n  - Loss: Blevins (0 - 1)\n  - This is a loss by Blevins but against the Athletics, not the Angels or White Sox.\n\n- **Games Against Angels:**\n  - Rows 6 to 9 cover games against the Angels.\n  - The losses in these rows are attributed to Mendoza, Saunders, Rodr\u00edguez, and Wright, none of which is Blevins.\n\n- **Games Against White Sox:**\n  - Rows 10 to 23 cover games against the White Sox.\n  - The losses in these rows are attributed to Floyd, Millwood, Logan, V\u00e1zquez, Mendoza, and Guardado, none of which is Blevins.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBlevins does not have a loss recorded against either the Angels or the White Sox in July 2008.
