    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"David Frost be from United States\" is true or false, we need to examine the table for information about David Frost's country.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate Row with Player Name \"David Frost\":**\n   - The table lists players and their details in each row.\n   - We look at each row to find where \"player: david frost\" is mentioned.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Information for David Frost:**\n   - In Row 3, we find the entry: \n     ```\n     place: t2, player: david frost, country: south africa, score: 70 + 68 + 70 = 208, to par: - 5\n     ```\n\n3. **Check Country for David Frost:**\n   - The \"country\" column in Row 3 states \"south africa.\"\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim Against the Table Data:**\n   - The claim is that David Frost is from the United States.\n   - According to the table, David Frost's country is listed as South Africa.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the table specifies that David Frost is from South Africa and not the United States, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 3, \"player\" column confirms it is David Frost.\n- Row 3, \"country\" column indicates his country as South Africa.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
