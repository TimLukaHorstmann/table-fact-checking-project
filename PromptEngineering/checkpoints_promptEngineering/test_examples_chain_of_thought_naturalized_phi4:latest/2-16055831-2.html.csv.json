However, if it implies the method by which the opponent won:\n     - In Row 8, the method was submission (armbar).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - There is only one loss in 2007, not two as claimed.\n   - The location and method for the single loss are consistent with the claim's details.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis, the claim that \"the fighter have 2 loss in 2007, both with method win with the location Itapeua, Brazil\" is FALSE.
