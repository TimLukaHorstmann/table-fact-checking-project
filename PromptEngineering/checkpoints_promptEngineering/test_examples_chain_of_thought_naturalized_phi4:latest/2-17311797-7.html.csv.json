In all other winning games, they scored more than 99 points.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim that Game 40 is the highest-scoring game for Orlando Magic is FALSE because they scored higher in Games 39 and 37.\n   - The claim that Game 45 is the lowest-scoring game for Orlando Magic is TRUE as no other winning game had fewer points than 99.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"In Game 40, Orlando Magic scored 109 points, which is not their highest score in any game.

We need to find which team played its first game in January.\n   - On January 2, Row 1 shows a game played by Orlando Magic against Miami Heat.\n\n2. **Analyze Orlando Magic's Performance on January 2:**\n   - According to Row 1, the Orlando Magic won their game on January 2 with a score of 86-76 (OT).\n   - Their record after this win was 26-7.\n\n3. **Check Other Teams' First Game in January:**\n   - The next team listed is Toronto Raptors, playing on January 4 (Row 2). \n   - They lost their game and had a record of 26-8.\n   - We need to ensure there are no other games by different teams between January 1 and January 3 that could have been the first for another team.\n\n4. **Verify There Are No Other First Games in January Before January 2:**\n   - The table starts with Row 1 on January 2, indicating this is the earliest game listed.\n   - Therefore, no other teams played before January 2 within the scope of this data set.\n\n5. **Conclusion Based on Records:**\n   - Since Orlando Magic won their first game in January (January 2) and had a record of 26-7 afterward, they indeed have the best possible record for a team playing its first game in January within this dataset.\n   - The next earliest game by another team is on January 4, where Toronto Raptors had a record of 26-8 after losing.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim that \"Orlando have the best record in the first game of January\" is TRUE.
