However, we must verify if any specific mention in the table indicates a 45-yard touchdown reception, which isn't directly specified here but inferred from context.\n   - For Kevin McKenzie (Row 4), the \"td 's\" is 12, again indicating multiple touchdowns. Similar to Harvey, no direct mention of the yardage for each touchdown is provided.\n\n5. **Cross-reference with Other Players:**\n   - Check other players' \"long\" values to ensure no one else has a longer reception.\n   - All other rows have a \"long\" value less than 45 yards, confirming that 45 yards is indeed the longest.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both Trandon Harvey and Kevin McKenzie have the longest receptions of 45 yards.\n   - The claim states these are also the longest touchdown receptions, which aligns with the context given no other player has a longer reception or specific mention of a longer touchdown.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is consistent with the data provided in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Trandon Harvey and Kevin McKenzie both have a longest reception of 45 yards.
