    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Chris Bosh have the second most high point in March\" is true or false, we need to analyze the data provided in the table for March games.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify All High Points in March:**\n   - Extract all instances where a player scored the highest points in each game during March.\n   - From the table:\n     - Game 61 (March 1): Chris Bosh (28)\n     - Game 62 (March 3): Andrea Bargnani, Chris Bosh (25)\n     - Game 63 (March 6): Chris Bosh (34)\n     - Game 64 (March 8): Chris Bosh (30)\n     - Game 65 (March 11): Andrea Bargnani (21)\n     - Game 66 (March 13): Chris Bosh (27)\n     - Game 67 (March 15): Andrea Bargnani (27)\n     - Game 68 (March 16): Chris Bosh (18)\n     - Game 69 (March 20): Chris Bosh (35)\n     - Game 70 (March 22): Chris Bosh (16)\n     - Game 71 (March 25): Andrea Bargnani (23)\n     - Game 72 (March 27): Chris Bosh (21)\n     - Game 73 (March 29): Chris Bosh (31)\n\n2. **Count the Highest Point Instances for Each Player:**\n   - Count how many times each player had the highest points in March:\n     - **Chris Bosh**: Games 61, 62, 63, 64, 66, 68, 69, 70, 72, 73 (10 instances)\n     - **Andrea Bargnani**: Games 62, 65, 67, 71 (4 instances)\n\n3. **Determine the Player with the Most High Points:**\n   - Chris Bosh has the most instances of being the high points player in March.\n\n4. **Check for Second Most High Points:**\n   - The next highest count after Chris Bosh is Andrea Bargnani with 4 instances.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Chris Bosh has the most instances, he cannot be second.
