    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"luk\u00e1\u0161 melich never throw for greater than 78 m\" is true or false, we need to examine each row of the table to find any recorded throws exceeding 78 meters.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: We are interested in the \"notes\" column because it contains the throw distances.\n2. **Review Each Entry**:\n   - Row 1: Notes are \"61.51 m\". This is less than 78 m.\n   - Row 2: Notes are \"64.20 m\". This is less than 78 m.\n   - Row 3: Notes are \"66.41 m\". This is less than 78 m.\n   - Row 4: Notes are \"71.26 m\". This is less than 78 m.\n   - Row 5: Notes are \"74.53 m\". This is less than 78 m.\n   - Row 6: Notes are \"73.77 m\". This is less than 78 m.\n   - Row 7: Notes are \"70.56 m\". This is less than 78 m.\n   - Row 8: Notes are \"74.47 m\". This is less than 78 m.\n   - Row 9: Notes are \"77.17 m\". This is less than 78 m.\n   - Row 10: Notes are \"79.36 m\". This is greater than 78 m.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: In Row 10, Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich achieved a throw of 79.36 meters, which exceeds the 78-meter mark mentioned in the claim.\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The claim is false because there is at least one instance where he threw more than 78 meters.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Examine each row's 'notes' column to check for throws greater than 78 m.
