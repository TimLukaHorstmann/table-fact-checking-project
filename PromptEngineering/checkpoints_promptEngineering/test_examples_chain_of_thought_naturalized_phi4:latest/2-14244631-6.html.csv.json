    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table data and compare the ranks of South Korea and the United States with other competitors.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Ranks for South Korea and the United States:**\n   - From Row 2, the United States has a rank of 1.\n   - From Row 6, South Korea has a rank of 5.\n\n2. **Compare with Other Nations:**\n   - Mexico (Row 1) also has a rank of 1.\n   - Brazil and Japan (Rows 3 and 4) both have a rank of 3.\n   - Canada shares the same rank as South Korea, which is 5 (Row 5).\n\n3. **Interpretation of Rank Values:**\n   - In this context, lower numerical ranks indicate higher positions. Therefore, a rank of 1 is higher than a rank of 3 or 5.\n\n4. **Conclusion on Ranks:**\n   - The United States has the highest rank (1), tied with Mexico.\n   - South Korea does not have a higher rank than all other competitors; it shares its rank (5) with Canada and ranks lower than both the United States and Mexico.\n\n5. **Final Evaluation of the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"South Korea and the United States rank higher than all other competitors.\" This is false because South Korea does not have a higher rank than all other nations; it shares its rank with Canada and ranks below the United States, Mexico, Brazil, and Japan.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 2: United States (rank: 1)\n- Row 6: South Korea (rank: 5)\n- Row 1: Mexico (rank: 1)\n- Row 3 & 4: Brazil and Japan (rank: 3)\n- Row 5: Canada (rank: 5)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The United States has a rank of 1, which is the highest in the table.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"only Canada won more than 1 medal in football in the 2012 Summer Olympics\" is true or false, we need to analyze the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Table Structure:**\n   - The table lists nations along with their rankings and medals (gold, silver, bronze) won.\n   - Each row represents a nation's performance, except for Row 7 which is a summary of total medals.\n\n2. **Analyzing Medal Counts per Nation:**\n   - Row 1: Mexico has 1 gold medal.\n   - Row 2: United States has 1 gold medal.\n   - Row 3: Brazil has 1 silver medal.\n   - Row 4: Japan has 1 silver medal.\n   - Row 5: Canada has 1 bronze medal.\n   - Row 6: South Korea has 1 bronze medal.\n\n3. **Checking for Nations with More than 1 Medal:**\n   - Each nation listed (Mexico, United States, Brazil, Japan, Canada, South Korea) has exactly one type of medal and a total count of 1 medal.\n   - None of the nations listed have more than 1 medal according to the individual rows.\n\n4. **Total Medals Verification:**\n   - Row 7 confirms the totals: 2 golds, 2 silvers, and 2 bronzes, summing up to 6 medals in total.\n   - This matches the distribution across the nations (each nation has exactly one medal).\n\n5. **Evaluating the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"only Canada won more than 1 medal.\"\n   - Based on our analysis, Canada only has 1 bronze medal, just like all other listed nations.\n   - No nation in the table has more than 1 medal.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false because no nation in the provided data won more than one medal. Specifically, Canada did not win more than 1 medal; it won exactly 1.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Analyzed each row to check the number of medals per nation.
