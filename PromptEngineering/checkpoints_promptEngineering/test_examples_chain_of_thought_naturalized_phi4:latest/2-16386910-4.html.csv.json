    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"The San Antonio Spurs do not score less than 100 points during any game before December 19, 1976\" is true or false, we need to examine the games played by the San Antonio Spurs as visitors from the start of December through December 18, 1976. We will focus on the scores where the Spurs are listed as the visitor.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** \n   - We need to check all games played by the Spurs as visitors before December 19, 1976.\n   - The relevant rows for visitor games before this date are: Row 1 (December 2), Row 2 (December 3), Row 3 (December 5), and Row 8 (December 15).\n\n2. **Check Scores in Each Relevant Row:**\n   - **Row 1:** Date: December 2, Visitor: San Antonio Spurs, Score: 116 - 124\n     - The Spurs scored 116 points.\n   - **Row 2:** Date: December 3, Visitor: San Antonio Spurs, Score: 105 - 114\n     - The Spurs scored 105 points.\n   - **Row 3:** Date: December 5, Visitor: San Antonio Spurs, Score: 98 - 103\n     - The Spurs scored 98 points. This is less than 100 points.\n   - **Row 8:** Date: December 15, Visitor: San Antonio Spurs, Score: 102 - 116\n     - The Spurs scored 102 points.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - In Row 3 (December 5), the San Antonio Spurs scored 98 points, which is less than 100.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false because there was at least one game where they scored less than 100 points before December 19, 1976.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified games as visitors before December 19, 1976.
