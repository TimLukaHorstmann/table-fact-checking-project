    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the highest attendance for a home game on December 26 during the Philadelphia Flyers' 2008-2009 season is true, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Home Games**: We need to look at each row in the table and identify which games were home games for the Philadelphia Flyers. This can be determined by checking if the 'home' column lists \"philadelphia\".\n\n2. **Filter December Games**: From the identified home games, filter out those that occurred in December.\n\n3. **Compare Attendance Figures**: For these December home games, compare the attendance figures to find the highest one.\n\n4. **Verify Claim Date and Attendance**: Check if the game with the highest attendance on a home game for Philadelphia Flyers in December took place on December 26 and matches the specified attendance figure.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Determine whether the claim is true based on the analysis above.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the table:\n\n- **Step 1: Identify Home Games**  \n  - Rows with \"home\": philadelphia are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14.\n\n- **Step 2: Filter December Games**  \n  - From these rows, filter those with dates in December:\n    - Row 1: date: december 2\n    - Row 2: date: december 4\n    - Row 4: date: december 9\n    - Row 5: date: december 11\n    - Row 6: date: december 13\n    - Row 7: date: december 16\n    - Row 9: date: december 20\n    - Row 11: date: december 23\n\n- **Step 3: Compare Attendance Figures**  \n  - Check the 'attendance' for these December home games:\n    - Row 1: attendance: 19227\n    - Row 2: attendance: 19577\n    - Row 4: attendance: 19037\n    - Row 5: attendance: 19057\n    - Row 6: attendance: 19811\n    - Row 7: attendance: 19219\n    - Row 9: attendance: 19897\n    - Row 11: attendance: 19578\n\n- **Step 4: Verify Claim Date and Attendance**  \n  - The highest attendance among these games is 19897 (Row 9).\n  - The claim states the game with the highest attendance was on December 26, but none of the identified home games in December occurred on this date. Row 12 has a game on December 26, but it is an away game for Philadelphia Flyers.\n\n- **Conclusion**:  \n  - The claim is false because the highest attended home game in December did not occur on December 26; instead, it was on December 20 with an attendance of 19897.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified all Philadelphia home games and filtered for those in December.
