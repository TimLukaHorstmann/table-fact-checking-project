    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to examine the specific entry related to Marseille and Zenit St. Petersburg.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - The claim involves \"Marseille\" as the first team in a match. We need to locate the row where \"team 1\" is Marseille.\n   - According to the table, this information appears in Row 8.\n\n2. **Check the First Leg Score for Marseille:**\n   - In Row 8, we see the details for the match between Marseille and Zenit St. Petersburg.\n   - The column labeled \"1st leg\" shows the score as \"3 - 1\".\n\n3. **Verify the Claim Against the Table Data:**\n   - The claim states that when Marseille is the first team, the first leg's score should be \"3 - 1\".\n   - From Row 8, we confirm that the first leg's score is indeed \"3 - 1\" for the match where Marseille is the first team.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim accurately reflects the information provided in the table.\n   - Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim involves checking if the first leg's score was '3 - 1' when Marseille played as team 1.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Bolton Wanderers' scores being the same in both legs is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row**: The table lists different teams and their match results. We need to find the row corresponding to \"bolton wanderers.\" According to the table:\n   - Row 3: team 1 is \"bolton wanderers.\"\n\n2. **Extract the Scores for Bolton Wanderers**:\n   - For the first leg, we look at the column labeled \"1st leg\" in Row 3.\n     - The score is \"1 - 1.\"\n   - For the second leg, we look at the column labeled \"2nd leg\" in Row 3.\n     - The score is \"0 - 1.\"\n\n3. **Compare the Scores**:\n   - First leg score: 1 - 1\n   - Second leg score: 0 - 1\n   - These scores are not the same.\n\n4. **Determine the Truth Value of the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that \"the 1st leg score and the 2nd leg score be the same for the bolton wanderer.\"\n   - Since the scores (1 - 1) and (0 - 1) are different, the claim is FALSE.\n\n5. **List Relevant Cells**:\n   - Row 3, Column \"1st leg\" with value \"1 - 1\"\n   - Row 3, Column \"2nd leg\" with value \"0 - 1\"\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the row for 'bolton wanderers' in the table.
