    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Corinthians' losses is true, let's break down the information provided:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim states that \"there be less than 11 loss that corinthians receive when they amass 22 point.\" This means we need to verify if Corinthians have fewer than 11 losses when their points total 22.\n\n2. **Locate Corinthian's Data**:\n   - From the table, identify the row corresponding to Corinthians.\n   - Row 6 contains the data for Corinthians: position 6, team: corinthians, points: 22, played: 22, drawn: 2, lost: 10, against: 51, difference: -20.\n\n3. **Analyze the Data**:\n   - The points for Corinthians are indeed 22.\n   - The number of losses recorded is 10.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim specifies \"less than 11 losses\" when they have 22 points.\n   - Corinthians have exactly 10 losses, which is less than 11.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the data from Row 6 for Corinthians, the number of losses (10) is indeed less than 11 when their points are 22. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's structure this into a JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim involves verifying if Corinthians have fewer than 11 losses when they have 22 points.\",\n    \"Locate the data for Corinthians in Row 6: points = 22, losses = 10.\",\n    \"Compare the number of losses (10) to the threshold specified in the claim (<11).\",\n    \"Since 10 is less than 11, the claim holds true.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Corinthians is true, we need to analyze the information given in the table regarding their performance.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - We need to check if there are any matches where Corinthians scored over 25 points and did not lose.\n   \n2. **Locate Corinthians' Row:**\n   - From the table, Corinthains is listed in Row 6.\n\n3. **Extract Key Data for Corinthians:**\n   - Points: 22\n   - Played: 22\n   - Drawn: 2\n   - Lost: 10\n   - Against (Goals Conceded): 51\n\n4. **Understand the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that there were zero losses when Corinthians scored over 25 points.\n\n5. **Analyze Available Data:**\n   - The table provides total statistics but does not provide a breakdown of individual matches, including scores.\n   - Without detailed match data (specific goals scored and conceded in each game), we cannot verify if Corinthians ever scored over 25 points without losing.\n\n6. **Conclusion Based on Given Information:**\n   - Since the table lacks specific match details, we cannot confirm or deny the claim based solely on the provided summary statistics.\n   - Therefore, with the information available, we cannot conclude that there were zero losses when scoring over 25 points.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nGiven the lack of detailed match data in the table, we cannot verify the claim. Thus, based on the available information, the claim remains unverified and is considered FALSE due to insufficient evidence.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires specific match details about Corinthians' scores and outcomes, which are not provided in the summary statistics of the table.
