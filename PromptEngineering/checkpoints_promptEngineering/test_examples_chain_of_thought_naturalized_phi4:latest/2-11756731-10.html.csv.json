    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Isaac have the decision in every game when Detroit be home or Nashville be home\" is true, we need to examine the \"decision\" column for each row in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that Isaac was responsible for the decision in all games, regardless of whether Detroit was hosting (home) or visiting, and similarly if Nashville was hosting or visiting.\n\n2. **Review the Table**: We have six rows representing different game days between Nashville and Detroit.\n\n3. **Check Each Game's Decision**:\n   - **Row 1**: Visitor: Nashville, Home: Detroit, Decision: Ellis\n     - This matches Isaac as the decision-maker.\n   - **Row 2**: Visitor: Nashville, Home: Detroit, Decision: Ellis\n     - This also matches Isaac as the decision-maker.\n   - **Row 3**: Visitor: Detroit, Home: Nashville, Decision: Ellis\n     - Again, this is Isaac's decision.\n   - **Row 4**: Visitor: Detroit, Home: Nashville, Decision: Ellis\n     - Isaac was the decision-maker here too.\n   - **Row 5**: Visitor: Nashville, Home: Detroit, Decision: Ellis\n     - Isaac made the decision in this game as well.\n   - **Row 6**: Visitor: Detroit, Home: Nashville, Decision: Ellis\n     - Once more, Isaac is noted as the decision-maker.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: In every row of the table, \"Ellis\" is listed under the \"decision\" column. Assuming \"Isaac\" refers to \"Ellis,\" then the claim holds true for all games listed in the table.\n\n5. **Final Answer**: The claim is TRUE since Isaac (or Ellis) was responsible for the decision in every game between Detroit and Nashville, regardless of which team was home or visiting.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**: All cells under the \"decision\" column are relevant because they confirm who made the decisions for each game.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim is that Isaac has the decision in every game when Detroit is at home or Nashville is at home.
