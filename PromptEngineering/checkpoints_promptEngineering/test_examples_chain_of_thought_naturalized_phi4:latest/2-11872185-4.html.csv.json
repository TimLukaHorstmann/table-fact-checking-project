    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"no lifetime India distributor share was given earlier than 2009,\" we need to analyze the table and identify any movies with a release year before 2009.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that no movie in this list has been distributed (i.e., has a lifetime India distributor share) before the year 2009.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Information**: We need to focus on the \"year\" column of each row to determine when each movie was released.\n\n3. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: Movie: Chennai Express, Year: 2013\n   - **Row 2**: Movie: Ek Tha Tiger, Year: 2012\n   - **Row 3**: Movie: 3 Idiots, Year: 2009\n   - **Row 4**: Movie: Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, Year: 2013\n   - **Row 5**: Movie: Dabangg 2, Year: 2012\n   - **Row 6**: Movie: Bodyguard, Year: 2011\n   - **Row 7**: Movie: Dabangg, Year: 2010\n   - **Row 8**: Movie: Rowdy Rathore, Year: 2012\n   - **Row 9**: Movie: Agneepath, Year: 2012\n   - **Row 10**: Movie: Ready, Year: 2011\n\n4. **Check for Any Movies Released Before 2009**:\n   - All listed movies have a release year of 2009 or later.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there are no movies in the table with a release year earlier than 2009, the claim is true.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that no movie was distributed before 2009.
