    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to evaluate each part of the claim by examining the provided data.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \n\"1184 of 5008, 1402 of 5008, 1666 of 5008, and 2105 of 5008 be the census ranking for the parish with an area smaller than 200 square km.\"\n\nWe need to check if each of these census rankings corresponds to a parish with an area less than 200 km\u00b2.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Census Rankings and Corresponding Areas:**\n\n   - **1184 of 5008**:\n     - Row 2 (Kent) has this ranking.\n     - Area = 839.79 km\u00b2\n     - Since 839.79 > 200, this does not satisfy the condition.\n\n   - **1402 of 5008**:\n     - Row 4 (Brighton) has this ranking.\n     - Area = 508.3 km\u00b2\n     - Since 508.3 > 200, this does not satisfy the condition.\n\n   - **1666 of 5008**:\n     - Row 7 (Richmond) has this ranking.\n     - Area = 258.82 km\u00b2\n     - Since 258.82 > 200, this does not satisfy the condition.\n\n   - **2105 of 5008**:\n     - Row 11 (Simonds) has this ranking.\n     - Area = 75.54 km\u00b2\n     - Since 75.54 < 200, this satisfies the condition.\n\n2. **Conclusion:**\n\n   For the claim to be true, all specified census rankings must correspond to parishes with areas smaller than 200 km\u00b2. However, only one of them (2105) meets this criterion. The others do not.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim is FALSE because not all specified census rankings are for parishes with an area smaller than 200 square km.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
