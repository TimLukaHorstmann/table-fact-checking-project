This implies two separate matches with these scores, contributing to some form of cumulative or aggregate outcome.\n\n2. **Analyzing Each Row in the Table**:\n   - **Row 1**: Score is \"1 - 0\" and Result is \"4 - 0\". This does not match \"4 - 1\".\n   - **Row 2**: Score is \"3 - 2\" and Result is \"3 - 2\". This does not match \"4 - 1\".\n   - **Row 3**: Score is \"4 - 1\" and Result is \"4 - 1\".
