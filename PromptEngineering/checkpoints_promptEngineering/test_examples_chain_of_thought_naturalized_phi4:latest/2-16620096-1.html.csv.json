    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Eug\u00e8ne Schaus be the only minister that begin his term in the fall\" is TRUE or FALSE, let's go through each step of reasoning using the provided table:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Start Dates**: We need to examine the \"start date\" for each minister listed in the table to determine if their term began in the fall.\n\n2. **Determine Fall Months**: In many contexts, \"fall\" refers to September, October, and November. However, since we are dealing with dates specific to the month of February through August (from provided data), none of these months directly falls within traditional fall months.\n\n3. **Examine Each Minister's Start Date**:\n   - **Row 1**: Eug\u00e8ne Schaus starts on \"6 February 1969\". This date is in February, which is not considered fall.\n   - **Row 2**: \u00c9mile Krieps starts on \"15 June 1974\". This date is in June, which is also not fall.\n   - **Row 3**: \u00c9mile Krieps again starts on \"16 July 1979\", still a summer month, not fall.\n   - **Row 4**: Marc Fischbach begins his term on \"20 July 1984\", another summer date.\n   - **Row 5**: Jacques Poos's start date is \"14 July 1989\", in the summer months.\n   - **Row 6**: Alex Bodry starts on \"13 July 1994\", also a summer month.\n   - **Row 7**: Alex Bodry again begins on \"26 January 1995\". This date falls in winter, not fall.\n\n4. **Conclusion from Examination**:\n   - None of the ministers listed have start dates that correspond to fall months (September, October, November).\n   - Therefore, Eug\u00e8ne Schaus did not begin his term in the fall, and since no other minister has a start date in the fall, he cannot be \"the only\" one who began his term in the fall.\n\n5. **Final Determination**:\n   - The claim that Eug\u00e8ne Schaus was the only minister to begin his term in the fall is FALSE because no ministers have terms beginning during fall months according to the provided data.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- We analyzed all rows for \"start date\" and determined none align with traditional fall months.
