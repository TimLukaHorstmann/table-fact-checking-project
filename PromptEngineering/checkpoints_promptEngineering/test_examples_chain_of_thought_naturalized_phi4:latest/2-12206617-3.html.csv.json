However, since we are only interested in May games, we will consider May 28, May 29, and May 30 as they are the last three dates listed.\n\n2. **Review Game Results for These Dates:**\n   - **May 28:** Opponent is Athletics with a score of 8 - 4. The \"loss\" column shows `acker (1 - 2)`, indicating that Acker was the losing pitcher, meaning the Blue Jays won this game.\n   - **May 29:** Opponent is Athletics with a score of 8 - 3. The \"loss\" column shows `slusarski (1 - 2)`, indicating that Slusarski was the losing pitcher, meaning the Blue Jays won this game as well.\n   - **May 30:** Opponent is Athletics with a score of 8 - 6. The \"loss\" column shows `ward (0 - 2)`, indicating that Ward was the losing pitcher, meaning the Blue Jays won this game too.\n\n3. **Determine Wins and Losses:**\n   - For May 28, May 29, and May 30, the Toronto Blue Jays won all three games.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"the toronto blue jay win 2 of the last 3 game they play in may 1991.\"\n   - Since they won all three games (not just two), the claim is technically correct, as winning 2 out of 3 includes winning 3 out of 3.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is TRUE based on the data provided.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- May 28: Row 24\n- May 29: Row 25\n- May 30: Row 26\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The last three games in May were against the Athletics on May 28, May 29, and May 30.
