However, the sequence of games and record progression can help infer this.\n   - The Blue Bomber's record before this game is 7-10, and after this game, it becomes 8-10, indicating a win.\n\n3. **Identify the game against Montreal Alouettes:**\n   - Look for the row where the opponent is \"montreal alouettes\" and confirm the date as October 26.\n   - Row 18 matches this criterion:\n     - Date: oct 26\n     - Opponent: montreal alouettes\n     - Result: win\n\n4. **Check if it was an away game:**\n   - The sequence of games shows a change in attendance figures, which can suggest location changes.\n   - Before the October 26 game, the attendance was 20202 (Row 18), and after, it is 24595 (Row 19).\n   - Row 17 (the previous game against Calgary Stampeders) had an attendance of 30110, indicating a higher home attendance.\n   - The significant drop in attendance from 30110 to 20202 suggests the October 26 game was likely played away.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The Blue Bomber played at home on November 1 against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats (win).\n- They played an away game on October 26 against the Montreal Alouettes (win).\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified Row 19 for the game on Nov 1 against Hamilton Tiger-Cats, confirming it was a win.

According to Row 17, the game took place on October 18.\n  - Identify the opponent and result from Row 17:\n    - Opponent: Calgary Stampeders\n    - Result: Loss (Score 37-16)\n  \n  Conclusion: The Blue Bombers did not defeat the Toronto Argonauts on October 18. Instead, they played against the Calgary Stampeders and lost.\n\n### Part 2: Verification\n- **Claim:** \"But lose to the Calgary Stampeders the following week by a score of 37 - 16.\"\n\n  - Determine the week after October 18 from Row 17:\n    - Week of the game on Oct 18 is Week 17.\n    - The following week is Week 18, dated October 26.\n  \n  - Check Row 18 for the opponent and result:\n    - Opponent: Montreal Alouettes\n    - Result: Win (Score 24-23)\n  \n  Conclusion: The Blue Bombers played against the Montreal Alouettes on October 26 and won.
