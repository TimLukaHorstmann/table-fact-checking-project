We need to find this in the table.\n   - Looking at the rows, we find that row 11 corresponds to week 12.\n\n2. **Check the Date for Week 12:**\n   - In row 11, check the column labeled \"date\" to see what date is listed.\n   - The date provided in row 11 for week 12 is December 2, 2001.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim Against the Table:**\n   - The claim states that week 12 should be on December 2, 2001.\n   - According to the table, week 12 is indeed on December 2, 2001.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the claim is accurate according to the data provided in the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim 'week 12 be on december 2 , 2001', we located week 12 in row 11 of the table.
