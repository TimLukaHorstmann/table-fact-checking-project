    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"james campbell be 2 pick ahead of rodney mccray in round 1\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - We are interested in the picks for both James Campbell and Rodney McCray.\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 2 corresponds to Rodney McCray with a pick number of 3 in round 1.\n     - Row 9 corresponds to James Campbell with a pick number of 185.\n\n2. **Check Rounds:**\n   - The claim specifies \"in round 1.\" \n   - Rodney McCray is indeed selected in round 1 (Row 2).\n   - However, James Campbell is selected in round 9 (Row 9).\n\n3. **Analyze the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that James Campbell should be \"2 pick ahead of Rodney McCray in round 1.\"\n   - For this to be true, both players must be picked in the same round (round 1), and James Campbell's pick number would need to be two less than Rodney McCray's.\n\n4. **Evaluate Pick Numbers:**\n   - Rodney McCray is picked at position 3.\n   - If James Campbell were \"2 picks ahead,\" he would need to be picked at position 1 in round 1, which contradicts his actual pick number of 185 in round 9.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since James Campbell and Rodney McCray are not both selected in round 1, the claim cannot be true.\n   - Therefore, the statement is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 2: \"pick\" column (Rodney McCray's pick number in round 1).\n- Row 9: \"round\" and \"pick\" columns (James Campbell's round and pick number).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant rows for Rodney McCray and James Campbell.\",\n    \"Check the rounds in which they were picked.\",\n    \"Rodney McCray is picked in round 1, but James Campbell is picked in round 9.\",\n    \"The claim specifies a condition in round 1, which does not apply to James Campbell.\",\n    \"Evaluate if James Campbell could be '2 picks ahead' of Rodney McCray in round 1.\",\n    \"Since they are not both in round 1, the claim cannot be true.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
