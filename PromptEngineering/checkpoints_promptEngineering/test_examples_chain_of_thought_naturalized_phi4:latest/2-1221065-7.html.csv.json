Tournament is \"The Ace Group Classic.\"\n   - Row 2: Date is Mar 7, 2010. Tournament is \"Toshiba Classic.\"\n   - Row 3: Date is Mar 28, 2010. Tournament is \"Cap Cana Championship.\"\n   - Row 4: Date is Oct 24, 2010. Tournament is \"Administaff Small Business Classic.\"\n   - Row 5: Date is Aug 20, 2011.

The only mention of Peter Senior is in row 9, which is outside the specified date range (November 3, 2013).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- There are indeed three tournaments within the date range from 2010 through 2011.\n- None of these tournaments were won by Peter Senior.\n\nThus, the claim \"there be 3 tournament from 2010 through 2011, 1 of which be win by peter senior\" is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified five tournaments between 2010 and 2011.
