Whether both North Melbourne and Footscray scored 78 points.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n- **Row Identification for Each Team:**\n  - Locate the row involving North Melbourne. From Row 5, we find:\n    - Home team: St Kilda\n    - Away team: North Melbourne\n    - Scores: \n      - St Kilda (home): 72 points\n      - North Melbourne (away): 78 points\n\n- **Determine if North Melbourne Won:**\n  - Compare scores for this game. \n  - North Melbourne scored 78, and St Kilda scored 72.\n  - Since 78 > 72, North Melbourne won their match.\n\n- **Verify Footscray's Score:**\n  - Locate the row involving Footscray. From Row 6, we find:\n    - Home team: Hawthorn\n    - Away team: Footscray\n    - Scores:\n      - Hawthorn (home): 69 points\n      - Footscray (away): 78 points\n\n- **Determine if Footscray Won:**\n  - Compare scores for this game.\n  - Footscray scored 78, and Hawthorn scored 69.\n  - Although Footscray scored the same number of points as North Melbourne, they won their match.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim states that both North Melbourne and Footscray \"won\" and each scored 78 points.

Therefore, Richmond did not lose to Collingwood; they won.\n\n#### Step 2: Verify \"Footscray beat Hawthorn\"\n- **Row 6** provides relevant data:\n  - Home team: Hawthorn\n  - Home team score: 10.9 (69)\n  - Away team: Footscray\n  - Away team score: 11.12 (78)\n\nFrom Row 6, we observe that the away team (Footscray) has a higher score than the home team (Hawthorn). Thus, Footscray did beat Hawthorn.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The first part of the claim (\"Richmond lose to Collingwood\") is FALSE.\n- The second part of the claim (\"Footscray beat Hawthorn\") is TRUE.\n\nSince both parts need to be true for the entire claim to be true and one part is false, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For \"Richmond lose to Collingwood\":\n  - Row 3: \n    - Home team score: 11.8 (74)\n    - Away team score: 14.13 (97)\n- For \"Footscray beat Hawthorn\":\n  - Row 6:\n    - Home team score: 10.9 (69)\n    - Away team score: 11.12 (78)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
