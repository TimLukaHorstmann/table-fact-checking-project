This indicates that the royal house information is unavailable for state cao.\n\n2. **State: Chen**\n   - Locate the row for state \"chen\".\n   - In Row 3: The column 'royal house' is also listed as \"-\". This indicates that the royal house information is unavailable for state chen.\n\n3. **State: Song**\n   - Locate the row for state \"song\".\n   - In Row 13: Similarly, the column 'royal house' is marked as \"-\". This indicates that the royal house information is unavailable for state song.\n\n4. **State: Wey**\n   - Locate the row for state \"wey\".\n   - In Row 14: The 'royal house' column shows \"-\". This means the royal house information is unavailable for state wey.\n\n5. **State: Yan**\n   - Locate the row for state \"yan\".\n   - In Row 15: The 'royal house' column also shows \"-\". Therefore, the royal house information is unavailable for state yan.\n\nAfter examining each relevant row for these states, it is confirmed that the royal house information is indeed unavailable (indicated by \"-\") for all of them.

Also, it's for state \"cai\".\n   - **Row 2 to Row 15:** Check each row for:\n     - State: chen or lu\n     - Name: wu\n     - Title: duke\n\n3. **Specific Checks:**\n   - **Row 3 (State: chen):** \n     - Type: sovereign, Name: you, Title: duke\n     - The name is \"you\", not \"wu\".\n   - **Row 8 (State: lu):**\n     - Type: sovereign, Name: shen, Title: duke\n     - The name is \"shen\", not \"wu\".\n\n4. **Conclusion from Examination:**\n   - There is no row where the state is either \"chen\" or \"lu\" and the name is \"wu\" with the title \"duke\".\n   - Therefore, there is no sovereign named \"wu\" who is a duke of either chen or lu.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We examined each row to find if there exists a sovereign named 'wu' with the title 'duke' in states 'chen' or 'lu'.
