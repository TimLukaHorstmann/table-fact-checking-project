There are six different teams representing division d1.\n\n2. **Identify Teams from Division d2:**\n   - Row 3: Team 2 is FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard (d2).\n   - Row 4: Team 1 is Stade de Reims (d2).\n   - Row 6: Team 1 is FC S\u00e8te (d2).\n   - Row 7: Team 1 is AEP Bourg sous la Roche (d2).\n   - Row 7: Team 2 is Stade Quimp\u00e9rois (d2).\n\n   From the above, we see teams from d2 are represented by FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard, Stade de Reims, FC S\u00e8te, AEP Bourg sous la Roche, and Stade Quimp\u00e9rois. There are five different teams representing division d2.\n\n3. **Identify Teams from Division d3:**\n   - Row 8: Team 2 is US Cr\u00e9teil (d3).\n\n   From the above, we see only one team from d3 is represented, which is US Cr\u00e9teil.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Division d1 has more than two teams.\n- Division d2 has more than two teams.\n- Division d3 has only one team.\n\nSince division d3 does not have at least 2 teams represented, the claim \"all of d1, d2 and d3 be represent by at least 2 team\" is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells that helped determine the answer are those indicating the division (d1, d2, or d3) for each team mentioned in each row. Here are these cells:\n\n- Row 1: Team 1 (Toulouse FC - d1), Team 2 (OGC Nice - d1)\n- Row 2: Team 1 (Lille OSC - d1), Team 2 (AJ Auxerre - d1)\n- Row 3: Team 2 (FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard - d2)\n- Row 4: Team 1 (Stade de Reims - d2)\n- Row 5: Team 1 (FC Metz - d1)\n- Row 6: Team 2 (RC Lens - d1), Team 1 (FC S\u00e8te - d2)\n- Row 7: Team 1 (AEP Bourg sous la Roche - d2), Team 2 (Stade Quimp\u00e9rois - d2)\n- Row 8: Team 2 (US Cr\u00e9teil - d3)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To determine if the claim is true, I analyzed each division.
