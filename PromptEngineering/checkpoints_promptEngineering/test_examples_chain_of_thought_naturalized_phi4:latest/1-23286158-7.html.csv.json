Whether all games not played at the Rose Garden had attendances over 20,000.\n\nLet's break down these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n**Step 1: Identify Games Played at Rose Garden**\n- We need to check which games were played at the \"Rose Garden\" and their respective attendance figures.\n  \nFrom the table:\n- **Row 1**: Attendance is 20,507\n- **Row 3**: Attendance is 20,278\n- **Row 4**: Attendance is 20,629\n- **Row 5**: Attendance is 20,614\n- **Row 6**: Attendance is 20,465\n- **Row 7**: Attendance is 20,650\n- **Row 12**: Attendance is 20,249\n- **Row 13**: Attendance is 20,384\n\n**Step 2: Count Games at Rose Garden with Attendance Over 20,000**\n- All games listed in Step 1 have attendance figures exceeding 20,000.\n- Total games at Rose Garden = 8 games\n- Half of these games (4 games) should have attendance over 20,000 according to the claim.\n\n**Step 3: Verify Attendance for Games Not Played at Rose Garden**\n- Identify games not played at the Rose Garden and check their attendances.\n  \nFrom the table:\n- **Row 2**: Staples Center, Attendance is 15,104\n- **Row 8**: Verizon Center, Attendance is 12,209\n- **Row 9**: Wachovia Center, Attendance is 12,607\n- **Row 10**: TD Garden, Attendance is 18,624\n- **Row 11**: Palace of Auburn Hills, Attendance is 19,114\n- **Row 14**: Toyota Center, Attendance is 16,129\n\n**Step 4: Check if All Non-Rose Garden Games Have Attendances Over 20,000**\n- None of the games listed in Step 3 have attendance figures over 20,000.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim states two conditions:\n1. \"Only half of the games played at the Rose Garden\" should have attendance over 20,000.
