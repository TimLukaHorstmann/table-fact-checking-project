This means their \"age at appointment\" must be between 30 and 39, inclusive.\n\n2. **Analyze Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: Age at appointment is 28 (not in the 30s).\n   - **Row 2**: Age at appointment is 46 (not in the 30s).\n   - **Row 3**: Age at appointment is 37 (in the 30s).\n   - **Row 4**: Age at appointment is 55 (not in the 30s).\n   - **Row 5**: Age at appointment is 35 (in the 30s).\n   - **Row 6**: Age at appointment is 34 (in the 30s).\n   - **Row 7**: Age at appointment is 31 (in the 30s).\n   - **Row 8**: Age at appointment is 38 (in the 30s).\n   - **Row 9**: Age at appointment is 32 (in the 30s).\n\n3. **Count Individuals in Their 30s**:\n   - From the analysis above, the individuals appointed in their 30s are from rows: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n   - This totals to 6 politicians.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The claim states that \"6 of the politicians were appointed when they were in their 30s,\" which matches our count.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The ages at appointment for each row are checked against the criteria of being between 30 and 39.
