    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about seasons 4 and 5 having an equal gap between total prize money and potential prize money is true or false, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: \n   - Season 4 corresponds to Row 4.\n   - Season 5 corresponds to Row 5.\n\n2. **Extract Data for Each Season**:\n   - For Season 4 (Row 4):\n     - Total Prize Money: 104,000\n     - Potential Prize Money: 531,000\n\n   - For Season 5 (Row 5):\n     - Total Prize Money: 203,000\n     - Potential Prize Money: 539,000\n\n3. **Calculate the Gap Between Total and Potential Prize Money**:\n   - **Season 4**: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Gap} = \\text{Potential Prize Money} - \\text{Total Prize Money} = 531,000 - 104,000 = 427,000\n     \\]\n\n   - **Season 5**: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Gap} = \\text{Potential Prize Money} - \\text{Total Prize Money} = 539,000 - 203,000 = 336,000\n     \\]\n\n4. **Compare the Gaps**:\n   - Gap for Season 4: 427,000\n   - Gap for Season 5: 336,000\n\nSince 427,000 is not equal to 336,000, the claim that seasons 4 and 5 have an equal gap between total prize money and potential prize money is false.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified relevant rows for seasons 4 and 5.
