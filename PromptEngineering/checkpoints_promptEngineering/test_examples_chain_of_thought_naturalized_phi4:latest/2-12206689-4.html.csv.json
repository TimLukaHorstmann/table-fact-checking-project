    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about a Texas Rangers game on June 9, 2004, having an attendance of over 40,000 is true or false, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row**: The claim specifically mentions \"the 9th game\" in the season. We need to find which row corresponds to the 9th game played by the Texas Rangers.\n\n2. **Count Games Played**:\n   - Start counting from the first game and continue until reaching the 9th game.\n   - Note that games postponed do not count as played, so they should be excluded from this count.\n\n3. **Examine Each Row for Game Count**:\n   - Rows 1 to 7: These are all played games (no postponement), so we include these in our count.\n   - Row 8 and Row 9: Both are postponed, so they do not count towards the game total.\n   - Row 10: This is the 8th game played (since two prior rows were postponed).\n   - Row 11: This is the 9th game played.\n\n4. **Check Attendance for the 9th Game**:\n   - Refer to Row 11, which corresponds to the 9th game.\n   - Check the \"attendance\" column in this row to see if it is over 40,000.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - If the attendance is over 40,000 for Row 11, the claim is true.\n   - If not, the claim is false.\n\n6. **Extract Relevant Information**:\n   - The relevant row (Row 11) has an attendance of 32,962, which is less than 40,000.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The 9th game was played against the Cardinals on June 11, with an attendance of 32,962.\n- Therefore, the claim that this game had an attendance over 40,000 is false.\n\nHere's the final output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To determine if the 9th game had an attendance over 40,000: Count the games excluding postponed ones.
