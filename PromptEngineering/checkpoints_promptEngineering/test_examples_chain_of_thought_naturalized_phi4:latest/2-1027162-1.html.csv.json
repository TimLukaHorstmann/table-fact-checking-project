We need to locate any row(s) where the venue is Osaka.\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Rows:**\n   - Check each row for the venue being Osaka:\n     - Row 7: Venue is Moscow, Russia.\n     - Row 8: Venue is Osaka, Japan.\n\n3. **Examine the Event in Osaka:**\n   - Focus on Row 8 since it mentions Osaka as the venue.\n   - In this row, the competition is \"world championships\" and the event position for the 100 m is 2nd place with a time of 11.01 secs.\n\n4. **Count Events in Osaka:**\n   - Only one event (100 m) by Lauryn Williams is listed under Osaka in Row 8.\n   - The claim states there are \"2 events\" she competed in Osaka, but we only identified one from the table.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is only one event recorded for Lauryn Williams in Osaka and not two, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists events by year, competition, venue, position, event rank, and notes.
