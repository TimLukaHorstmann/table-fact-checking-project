    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the game on November 19, 1978, having the highest attendance is true or false, we need to examine the attendance figures for all the games listed in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Attendance Column**: \n   - The column of interest here is \"attendance\" as it provides the number of spectators for each game.\n\n2. **List All Attendances**:\n   - Row 1: 68,973\n   - Row 2: 49,502\n   - Row 3: 46,161\n   - Row 4: 71,536\n   - Row 5: 41,107\n   - Row 6: 59,337\n   - Row 7: 37,671\n   - Row 8: 44,235\n   - Row 9: 53,706\n   - Row 10: 55,468\n   - Row 11: 33,155\n   - **Row 12 (November 19, 1978)**: 45,022\n   - Row 13: 51,657\n   - Row 14: 50,068\n   - Row 15: 30,931\n   - Row 16: 56,674\n\n3. **Compare the Attendance Figures**:\n   - We need to find the maximum attendance figure from the list above.\n   - The highest attendance is in Row 4 with 71,536 attendees.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the game on November 19, 1978 (Row 12) had the highest attendance.\n   - However, the highest recorded attendance was for the game on September 24, 1978 (Row 4).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since Row 4 has a higher attendance than Row 12, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cells are those containing the attendance figures and specifically the one from November 19, 1978.\n- We particularly focus on Row 12 (November 19, 1978) for the claim and compare it to all other rows.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the 'attendance' column.
