    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Australia's scores against England during their test matches is true or false, we need to analyze the data provided in the table specifically for England vs. Australia matches.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Matches:**\n   - The claim involves test matches between England and Australia. We should focus on rows that mention both \"australia\" as an opposing team and \"test match\" or a similar status indicating it's part of the tests series against England.\n\n2. **Examine Each Relevant Row:**\n   - **Row 6:** This row lists a match against Australia with 22 points scored, dated 29/05/1988 at Ballymore, Brisbane, and is labeled \"first test.\"\n   - **Row 7:** This row lists another match against Australia with 28 points scored, dated 12/06/1988 at Concord Oval, Sydney, and is labeled \"second test.\"\n\n3. **Interpret the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Australia scored the most points during their second test match (which implies England scored more than 22 points in this game) and the second-most points during their first test match (implying there was only one other test with a higher score against England).\n\n4. **Compare Scores for Tests:**\n   - From Row 6, we know that in the first test, Australia scored 22 points.\n   - From Row 7, we see that in the second test, they scored 28 points.\n\n5. **Verify Against Other Matches:**\n   - We need to ensure there are no other matches with higher scores against England than these two tests.\n   - The table does not list any other \"test match\" entries involving Australia and England, confirming Rows 6 and 7 as the only relevant test matches for this comparison.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - In the first test (Row 6), Australia scored 22 points, which is indeed the second-highest score against England in tests since the second test (Row 7) had a higher score of 28.\n   - In the second test (Row 7), Australia's score of 28 points is the highest among the listed matches.\n\nTherefore, the claim is consistent with the data provided.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We identified that Rows 6 and 7 are relevant as they describe test matches between England and Australia.
