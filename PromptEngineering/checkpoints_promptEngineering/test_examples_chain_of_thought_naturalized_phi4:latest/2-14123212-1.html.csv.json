    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"englewood, illinois have 2 translator\" is true or false based on the given table, we need to analyze the relevant information.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that Englewood, Illinois has two translators. Translators are typically FM stations that rebroadcast other signals, but this detail isn't directly mentioned in the table. However, since it's a claim about the number of entries for Englewood, we will focus on how many times \"Englewood, Illinois\" appears.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**: We need to find all rows where the \"city of license\" is \"englewood, illinois\". \n\n3. **Check Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: City of License: elgin , illinois (Not relevant)\n   - **Row 2**: City of License: englewood , illinois (Relevant)\n   - **Row 3**: City of License: crown point , indiana (Not relevant)\n   - **Row 4**: City of License: park forest , illinois (Not relevant)\n   - **Row 5**: City of License: rochester , indiana (Not relevant)\n   - **Row 6**: City of License: south bend , indiana (Not relevant)\n\n4. **Count the Relevant Entries**: \n   - Only Row 2 has \"englewood, illinois\" as the city of license.\n\n5. **Determine if the Claim is True**:\n   - The claim states there are two translators for Englewood, Illinois.
