    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim regarding the engine power for the year 1972, we need to analyze the table data step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - The claim specifically mentions \"the power of the 1972 engine.\" Therefore, we focus on rows where the years include 1972.\n\n2. **Locate Entries for 1972:**\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 3 corresponds to the year 1972 with details about the engine and induction type.\n   \n3. **Check Power Information for 1972 Entry:**\n   - In Row 3, which lists details for the year 1972, we find:\n     - \"engine\": 455in cubic oldsmobile v8\n     - \"power\": -\n     - The power value is represented by a dash (\"-\"), indicating that no specific horsepower (hp) or kilowatt (kw) value is provided.\n\n4. **Interpret the Representation:**\n   - A dash in the table typically signifies missing data or an absence of specified information.\n   - Thus, it confirms that the power for the 1972 engine is not given.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states, \"the power of the 1972 engine be not give in hp (kw).\"\n   - Based on Row 3, where the power value is absent (\"-\"), this matches the claim's assertion that no specific power information is provided for the 1972 engine.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The data supports the claim that the power of the 1972 engine is not given in horsepower or kilowatts.\n\nBased on this analysis, we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim concerns whether power information for the 1972 engine is provided. Row 3 shows a dash '-' under 'power,' indicating no data is available. Therefore, it confirms that power in hp (kw) is not given for the 1972 engine.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"power\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
