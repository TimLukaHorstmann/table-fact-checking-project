Whether Fortec Motorsport earned 55 points in the 2011 season.\n\nLet's evaluate each part step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Verify Points for Fortec Motorsport in 2009\n\n- Look at all rows where \"team\" is \"fortec motorsport\" and \"season\" is 2009.\n- In Row 5, we find:\n  - Season: 2009\n  - Series: British Formula Renault 2.0\n  - Team: Fortec Motorsport\n  - Points: 457\n\nFortec Motorsport did not earn 293 points in any series in the 2009 season. They earned 457 points in the British Formula Renault 2.0.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Points for Fortec Motorsport in 2011\n\n- Look at all rows where \"team\" is \"fortec motorsport\" and \"season\" is 2011.\n- There are no entries for Fortec Motorsport in the 2011 season; instead, the team mentioned is Lotus ART.\n\nIn Row 8, we find:\n- Season: 2011\n- Series: GP3 Series\n- Team: Lotus ART\n- Points: 55\n\nLotus ART earned 55 points in the 2011 GP3 Series, but not Fortec Motorsport. \n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that \"Fortec Motorsport have 293 point in 2009 and have 55 point for 2011.\" Based on the table:\n- In 2009, Fortec Motorsport earned 457 points, not 293.\n- In 2011, they did not earn any points as their team was Lotus ART with 55 points.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 5: Points (Fortec Motorsport, 2009)\n- Rows 8 and 10: Team and Points (Lotus ART, 2011)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, verify Fortec Motorsport's points for the 2009 season.
