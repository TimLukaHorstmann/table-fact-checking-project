    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Liselotte Neumann winning three LPGA Classic tournaments in 1994, 1996, and 1998 is true or false, we need to examine each relevant row of the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Tournaments**: We are looking for \"LPGA Classic\" tournaments won by Liselotte Neumann in the years 1994, 1996, and 1998.\n   \n2. **Examine Each Year**:\n   - **1994**: Check Row 3 for any tournament named \"minnesota lpga classic\".\n     - Row 3: \n       - Date: 12 Jun 1994\n       - Tournament: Minnesota LPGA Classic\n       - Winning Score: -11 (68 + 71 + 66 = 205)\n       - Margin of Victory: 2 strokes\n       - Runner(s) - up: Hiromi Kobayashi\n     - The winner is not mentioned, but since we are tasked with determining if Liselotte Neumann won this tournament, it's crucial to have that information. However, the table doesn't explicitly state the winner.\n\n   - **1996**: Check Row 8 for any tournament named \"edina realty lpga classic\".\n     - Row 8:\n       - Date: 06 Jun 1996\n       - Tournament: Edina Realty LPGA Classic\n       - Winning Score: -9 (67 + 73 + 67 = 207)\n       - Margin of Victory: playoff\n       - Runner(s) - up: Brandie Burton, Carin Koch, Suzanne Strudwick\n     - Again, the winner is not mentioned explicitly in the table.\n\n   - **1998**: There are no rows for an \"LPGA Classic\" tournament in 1998. The relevant row (Row 11) refers to a different tournament.\n     - Row 11:\n       - Date: 22 Mar 1998\n       - Tournament: Standard Register Ping\n       - Winning Score: -13 (69 + 67 + 69 + 74 = 279)\n       - Margin of Victory: playoff\n       - Runner(s) - up: Rosie Jones\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \n   - The table does not provide explicit information about the winners for any \"LPGA Classic\" tournaments in 1994 or 1996, and there is no LPGA Classic tournament listed for 1998.\n   - Without explicit confirmation from the table that Liselotte Neumann won these specific tournaments, we cannot verify the claim based solely on this data.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"Liselotte Neumann win 3 lpga classic tournament in 1994 , 1996 , and 1998\" is **FALSE** given the information available in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table does not explicitly mention Liselotte Neumann as the winner for any 'LPGA Classic' tournaments in 1994 or 1996, nor does it list an LPGA Classic tournament for 1998.
