    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the Oklahoma City Thunder do not break 100 points at all during March 2009\" is true or false, we need to examine each game played by the team during that month according to the provided table.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Games**: We focus on games from March 2 to March 31, 2009.\n   \n2. **Check Game Scores**:\n   - For each game in this period, we need to look at the \"score\" column and see if the Thunder scored more than 100 points.\n\n3. **Examine Each Row for March Games**:\n   - **Row 1 (March 2)**: Score is \"w 96 - 87 (ot)\" - Oklahoma City scored 96 points.\n   - **Row 2 (March 4)**: Score is \"w 88 - 83 (ot)\" - Oklahoma City scored 88 points.\n   - **Row 3 (March 7)**: Score is \"l 90 - 108 (ot)\" - Oklahoma City scored 90 points.\n   - **Row 4 (March 8)**: Score is \"w 89 - 74 (ot)\" - Oklahoma City scored 89 points.\n   - **Row 5 (March 10)**: Score is \"w 99 - 98 (ot)\" - Oklahoma City scored 99 points.\n   - **Row 6 (March 11)**: Score is \"l 99 - 112 (ot)\" - Oklahoma City scored 99 points.\n   - **Row 7 (March 14)**: Score is \"l 95 - 106 (ot)\" - Oklahoma City scored 95 points.\n   - **Row 8 (March 16)**: Score is \"w 78 - 76 (ot)\" - Oklahoma City scored 78 points.\n   - **Row 9 (March 18)**: Score is \"l 96 - 103 (ot)\" - Oklahoma City scored 96 points.\n   - **Row 10 (March 20)**: Score is \"l 94 - 101 (ot)\" - Oklahoma City scored 94 points.\n   - **Row 11 (March 22)**: Score is \"w 97 - 90 (ot)\" - Oklahoma City scored 97 points.\n   - **Row 12 (March 24)**: Score is \"l 89 - 107 (ot)\" - Oklahoma City scored 89 points.\n   - **Row 13 (March 27)**: Score is \"l 96 - 112 (ot)\" - Oklahoma City scored 96 points.\n   - **Row 14 (March 29)**: Score is \"l 84 - 103 (ot)\" - Oklahoma City scored 84 points.\n   - **Row 15 (March 31)**: Score is \"w 96 - 95 (ot)\" - Oklahoma City scored 96 points.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: In every game listed for March, the highest number of points Oklahoma City scored in a single game was 99 (in games on March 10 and March 11).
