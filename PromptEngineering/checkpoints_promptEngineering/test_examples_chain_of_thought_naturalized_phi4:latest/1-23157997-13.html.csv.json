Therefore, he does not have a third stage win in this category. This already suggests that the claim might be false, but let's verify further.\n\n3. **Check if Lucas Sebastian Haedo is the Stage Winner During Kenneth Hanson's Third Win:**\n   - Since Kenneth Hanson only wins twice (Stages 3 and 4), there is no \"third stage\" for him to win.\n   - Therefore, it is impossible for any condition regarding a third win to be met.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The claim is false because Kenneth Hanson does not have a third stage as the mountain classification winner.
