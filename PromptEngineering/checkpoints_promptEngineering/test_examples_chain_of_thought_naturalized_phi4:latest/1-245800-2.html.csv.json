    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze the table data specifically for expeditions after 5 June 1980 and compare their durations.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Expeditions After 5 June 1980:**\n   - The relevant expeditions are those that have a launch date later than or equal to 6 June 1980.\n   - From the table, we identify these rows based on the \"launch date\" column:\n     - Row 8: Launch Date - 26 May 1980 (Before 5 June 1980)\n     - **Row 9:** Launch Date - 5 June 1980\n     - **Row 10:** Launch Date - 23 July 1980\n     - **Row 11:** Launch Date - 18 September 1980\n     - **Row 12:** Launch Date - 27 November 1980\n     - **Row 13:** Launch Date - 12 March 1981\n\n2. **Determine the Duration of Each Expedition:**\n   - For each identified expedition, check the \"duration (days)\" column:\n     - **Row 9:** Duration - 3.93 days\n     - **Row 10:** Duration - 7.86 days\n     - **Row 11:** Duration - 7.86 days\n     - **Row 12:** Duration - 12.8 days\n     - **Row 13:** Duration - 74.73 days\n\n3. **Compare Durations:**\n   - The longest duration among these expeditions is from Row 13, which is 74.73 days.\n   - The claim mentions \"Soyuz 28\" with a duration of 7.93 days, but this expedition occurred before 5 June 1980 (refer to Row 3).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim incorrectly identifies the expedition Soyuz 28 as the longest after 5 June 1980.\n   - In fact, the longest expedition after that date is from Row 13 with a duration of 74.73 days.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified expeditions after 5 June 1980 and compared their durations.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Yuri Romanenko being a member of both the Soyuz T-4 and Soyuz T-6 crew flights up to Salyut 6 is true or false, we need to examine the provided table data.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Crew for Soyuz T-4:**\n   - Locate entries in the table where \"flight up\" matches \"soyuz t - 4.\"\n   - This corresponds to Expedition Salyut 6 - EO - 6, found in Row 13.\n   - The crew listed for this mission are Vladimir Kovalyonok and Viktor Savinykh.\n\n2. **Identify Crew for Soyuz T-6:**\n   - The table does not mention a \"soyuz t - 6\" entry anywhere. We need to check the entire table to confirm its absence.\n   - Upon examining all rows, there is no mention of \"soyuz t - 6\" in any flight up or flight down column.\n\n3. **Identify Crew for Yuri Romanenko:**\n   - Find entries where \"Yuri Romanenko\" appears as part of the crew.\n   - He is listed in Row 1 (Expedition Salyut 6 - EO - 1) and Row 11 (Expedition Salyut 6 - EP - 8).\n   - In both instances, the flights up are \"soyuz 26\" for Row 1 and \"soyuz 38\" for Row 11.\n   - Yuri Romanenko is not listed as part of any Soyuz T-4 mission crew.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- **Soyuz T-4:** The members are Vladimir Kovalyonok and Viktor Savinykh. Yuri Romanenko is not part of this flight up.\n- **Soyuz T-6:** There is no mention or entry for a \"soyuz t - 6\" in the table, so it can't be associated with any crew member.\n\nGiven these findings, the claim that \"Yuri Romanenko be a member of the flight up soyuz t - 4 crew and also the flight upsoyuz t - 6 crew\" is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
