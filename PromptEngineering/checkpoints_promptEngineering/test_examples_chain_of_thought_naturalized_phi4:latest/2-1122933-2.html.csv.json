    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"thierry boutsen finish the 1985 Dutch Grand Prix right after marc surer\" is true or false, we need to analyze the information provided in the table for both drivers, Thierry Boutsen and Marc Surer.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Thierry Boutsen's Information:**\n   - Look at Row 12, which corresponds to Thierry Boutsen.\n   - The key information is that he completed \"54 laps\" and retired due to a suspension issue.\n\n2. **Identify Marc Surer's Information:**\n   - Look at Row 10, which corresponds to Marc Surer.\n   - He completed \"65 laps\" before retiring due to an exhaust problem.\n\n3. **Compare the Number of Laps Completed:**\n   - Thierry Boutsen completed 54 laps.\n   - Marc Surer completed 65 laps.\n\n4. **Determine Position Relative to Each Other:**\n   - For a driver to finish right after another, they must complete more laps than or equal to the other but fewer than any other driver who completed more laps.\n   - Since Marc Surer completed more laps (65) than Thierry Boutsen (54), Boutsen did not finish immediately after Surer. In fact, Boutsen finished with fewer laps than Surer.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is false because Thierry Boutsen did not finish right after Marc Surer; instead, he completed significantly fewer laps.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Thierry Boutsen (Row 12) finished with 54 laps and retired due to suspension.
