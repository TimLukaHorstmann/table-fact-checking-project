    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two parts:\n\n1. **Andrew Carnahan has an overall rank of 252**: We will check his overall number from the table.\n2. **Chad Nkang follows Andrew Carnahan in terms of overall ranking**: This means Chad's overall rank should be immediately after Andrew's.\n\nLet's go through each step:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Locate Andrew Carnahan's Row**:\n   - We identify Andrew Carnahan from the table: He is mentioned in Row 11.\n   - Check his \"overall\" number: The value given is 252.\n\n2. **Verify Chad Nkang's Position**:\n   - Locate Chad Nkang in the table: He is listed in Row 10.\n   - Check Chad's \"overall\" number: The value given is 251.\n\n3. **Compare Overall Rankings**:\n   - Andrew Carnahan has an overall of 252.\n   - Chad Nkang has an overall of 251.\n   - Since lower numbers indicate a higher rank (i.e., earlier in the draft), Chad Nkang, with an overall of 251, actually precedes Andrew Carnahan, who is ranked at 252.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that \"Andrew Carnahan have the highest overall of 252,\" which is correct. However, it also claims that he is followed by Chad Nkang. This part is incorrect because Chad Nkang's overall rank (251) actually precedes Andrew Carnahan's (252).\n\nBased on this reasoning:\n\n- The statement about Andrew having an overall of 252 is TRUE.\n- The statement about being \"followed\" by Chad Nkang is FALSE, as Chad is not following but rather preceding him in terms of draft order.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n- Row 11, Column: \"overall\" for Andrew Carnahan (value: 252)\n- Row 10, Column: \"overall\" for Chad Nkang (value: 251)\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because of the incorrect order between Chad and Andrew in terms of their overall rankings.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Andrew Carnahan's overall rank is 252.
