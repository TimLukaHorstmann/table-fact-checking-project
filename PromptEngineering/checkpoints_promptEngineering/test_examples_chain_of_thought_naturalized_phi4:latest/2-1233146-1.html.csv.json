    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2003, we need to examine the table for matches from that year involving first and second rounds. We'll verify if both legs were tied in the first leg.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Matches:**\n   - The claim pertains specifically to the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2003, so we need to look for rows where the competition is \"uefa intertoto cup\" and the season includes \"2003.\"\n\n2. **Locate the Rows:**\n   - Row 19 corresponds to the season \"1998,\" which is not relevant.\n   - Row 21 matches the criteria: it lists the competition as \"uefa intertoto cup,\" the round as \"first round,\" and the season as \"2003.\"\n   - Row 22 also matches: it indicates \"second round\" in the same year.\n\n3. **Verify First Leg Results:**\n   - For Row 21 (First Round):\n     - The club is \"odra wodzis\u0142aw.\"\n     - The first leg result is \"2 - 1,\" which is not a tie.\n   - For Row 22 (Second Round):\n     - The club is \"fc slovan liberec.\"\n     - The first leg result is \"0 - 2,\" which is also not a tie.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Neither the first nor second round of the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2003 had a tied result in their respective first legs according to the table data.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant matches for the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2003.\",\n    \"Locate rows 21 and 22, which correspond to the first and second rounds of the 2003 competition.\",\n    \"Check the first leg results: Row 21 shows '2 - 1' (not a tie), Row 22 shows '0 - 2' (not a tie).\",\n    \"Conclude that neither round had a tied result in the first leg.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"first_leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"first_leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
