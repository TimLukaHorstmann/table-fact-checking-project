    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, let's break down each part of the statement:\n\n1. **Identify Teams and Points for 2008**:\n   - The claim mentions two teams: \"Audax Italiano\" and \"La Serena.\"\n   - We need to verify their points earned in 2008.\n\n2. **Check Audax Italiano's 2008 Points**:\n   - According to the table, \"Audax Italiano\" has data for three different categories in 2008:\n     - `p ap 2008`: 20 , 40\n     - `p cl 2008`: 15 , 20\n   - The claim states that \"Audax Italiano earned 34 , 58 points in 2008 (p 2008).\"\n   - However, there is no single column labeled as `p 2008` for Audax Italiano. Instead, the table provides separate columns for Apertura (`p ap 2008`) and Clausura (`p cl 2008`) of 2008.\n\n3. **Check La Serena's 2008 Points**:\n   - According to the table, \"La Serena\" also has data for three different categories in 2008:\n     - `p ap 2008`: 15 , 60\n     - `p cl 2008`: 17 , 10\n   - The claim states that \"La Serena earned 18 , 24 points in 2008 (p 2008).\"\n   - Similarly, there is no single column labeled as `p 2008` for La Serena. The table provides separate columns for Apertura (`p ap 2008`) and Clausura (`p cl 2008`) of 2008.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the table does not have a combined `p 2008` column, the claim's reference to \"34 , 58 point in 2008 (p 2008)\" for Audax Italiano and \"18 , 24 point in 2008 (p 2008)\" for La Serena is incorrect.\n   - The points provided are specific to Apertura and Clausura of 2008, not a single cumulative value.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table does not contain a column labeled 'p 2008' for either team.
