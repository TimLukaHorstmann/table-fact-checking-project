    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"no game be play when the goal for be less than 30\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine each team's \"goals for\" values from the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that no games were played in which a team scored fewer than 30 goals overall.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row in the Table:**\n   - We need to check the \"goals for\" column for each row (team) to ensure none of them have a value less than 30.\n\n3. **Check Each Team's Goals For:**\n   - **Row 1:** Ottawa Hockey Club has goals for = 90\n     - 90 is not less than 30.\n   - **Row 2:** Montreal Wanderers has goals for = 74\n     - 74 is not less than 30.\n   - **Row 3:** Montreal Victorias has goals for = 76\n     - 76 is not less than 30.\n   - **Row 4:** Quebec Hockey Club has goals for = 57\n     - 57 is not less than 30.\n   - **Row 5:** Montreal Hockey Club has goals for = 49\n     - 49 is not less than 30.\n   - **Row 6:** Montreal Shamrocks has goals for = 30\n     - 30 is equal to 30, but not less than 30.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - All teams have scored at least 30 goals in total over the games they played.\n   - Therefore, the claim that no game was played when a team had fewer than 30 goals for is TRUE.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim states that no games were played where any team scored less than 30 goals in total.\",\n    \"Check each row's 'goals for' value to see if it is less than 30.\",\n    \"Ottawa Hockey Club: 90 (not less than 30)\",\n    \"Montreal Wanderers: 74 (not less than 30)\",\n    \"Montreal Victorias: 76 (not less than 30)\",\n    \"Quebec Hockey Club: 57 (not less than 30)\",\n    \"Montreal Hockey Club: 49 (not less than 30)\",\n    \"Montreal Shamrocks: 30 (equal to 30, but not less)\",\n    \"All teams have 'goals for' values of 30 or more.\",\n    \"Thus, the claim is TRUE.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
