    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"jerry mitchell win 2 tony award\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the table data related to Tony Awards for the year 2005 and identify any instances where Jerry Mitchell was a nominee and if he won.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Award Type:**\n   - The claim specifies \"Tony Award,\" so we will focus only on rows associated with Tony Awards from the year 2005.\n   \n2. **Filter Rows for Tony Awards:**\n   - From the table, filter out entries where the award type is \"tony award\" and the year is 2005.\n\n3. **Locate Jerry Mitchell in Tony Award Entries:**\n   - Look through these filtered rows to identify any instances where Jerry Mitchell is listed as a nominee.\n   \n4. **Check Results for Wins:**\n   - For each instance of Jerry Mitchell being a nominee under Tony Awards, check the result column to see if he won.\n\n5. **Count Wins:**\n   - Count how many times Jerry Mitchell is recorded as having \"won\" in the results column for Tony Awards.\n\n6. **Evaluate Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Jerry Mitchell won 2 Tony Awards. Compare the count of wins found with the number stated in the claim to determine if it's true or false.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Row 1:** Not relevant (category and nominee are both \"best revival of a musical\").\n- **Row 2:** Jerry Mitchell is not involved.\n- **Row 3:** \n  - Award: Tony Award\n  - Category: Best Choreography\n  - Nominee: Jerry Mitchell\n  - Result: Won\n\n  This row indicates that Jerry Mitchell won one Tony Award for Best Choreography.\n\n- No other rows are relevant to the claim as they either do not involve Jerry Mitchell or pertain to a different award type (Drama Desk).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nJerry Mitchell is recorded as having won only 1 Tony Award in 2005. The claim states he won 2, which is incorrect based on the table data.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify entries related to Tony Awards for the year 2005.\",\n    \"Locate Jerry Mitchell as a nominee within these entries.\",\n    \"Check if Jerry Mitchell won any of these awards.\",\n    \"Count the number of wins: Jerry Mitchell won 1 Tony Award.\",\n    \"Compare this count with the claim (2 wins).\",\n    \"The claim is false because Jerry Mitchell only won 1 Tony Award, not 2.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"category\", \"value\": \"best choreography\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominee\", \"value\": \"jerry mitchell\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\", \"value\": \"won\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
