We will focus on rows that have \"year: 1959\".\n\n2. **Locate Entries for Year 1959:**\n   - From the table, we identify:\n     - Row 5: year: 1959, entrant: british racing partnership, chassis: cooper t51\n     - Row 6: year: 1959, entrant: british racing partnership, chassis: cooper t51\n\n3. **Check for Entrant:**\n   - The claim mentions Ivor Bueb but does not specify the entrant. We need to verify if Ivor Bueb was associated with \"british racing partnership\" during these entries.\n   - Historical context tells us that Ivor Bueb did indeed race for British Racing Partnership (BRP) in 1959.\n\n4. **Verify Chassis Type:**\n   - Both Row 5 and Row 6 list the chassis as \"cooper t51\", which matches the claim.\n\n5. **Count Occurrences:**\n   - The table shows two entries (Row 5 and Row 6) for a Cooper T51 chassis in 1959 under British Racing Partnership.\n   - This confirms that Ivor Bueb raced a Cooper T51 chassis twice in 1959, assuming he was the driver for BRP during these races.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data and historical context.

However, there is no mention of Ivor Bueb as an entrant.\n   - **Row 5 (Year: 1959, Chassis: Cooper T51)**: This does not involve a Lotus 12.\n   - **Row 6 (Year: 1959, Chassis: Cooper T51)**: Again, this does not mention a Lotus 12.\n\n3. **Check for Ivor Bueb**: None of the rows list Ivor Bueb as an entrant.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since there is no entry in the table that lists both Ivor Bueb and the Lotus 12 chassis together between 1957 and 1959, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 4 is relevant because it mentions the Lotus 12 chassis, but does not mention Ivor Bueb.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was scanned for entries involving the Lotus 12 chassis between 1957 and 1959.
