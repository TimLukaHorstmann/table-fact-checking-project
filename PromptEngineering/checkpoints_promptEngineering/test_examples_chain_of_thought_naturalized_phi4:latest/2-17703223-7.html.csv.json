We'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Bruno Brand\u00e3o's Row**: \n   - Look through the table to find the row where the name is \"bruno brand\u00e3o ( bra )\".\n\n2. **Check the Snatch Value**:\n   - Once we locate the correct row, check the value in the \"snatch\" column for that row.\n\n3. **Verify the Country**:\n   - Ensure that the country code \"( bra )\" corresponds to Brazil.\n\n4. **Compare with Claim**:\n   - Compare the snatch value found with the claim's stated value of 157.0 kg.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate Bruno Brand\u00e3o**:\n   - From the table, Row 4 has \"name: bruno brand\u00e3o ( bra )\".\n\n2. **Check Snatch Value**:\n   - In Row 4, the \"snatch\" column value is 157.0.\n\n3. **Verify Country**:\n   - The country code \"( bra )\" in Row 4 corresponds to Brazil.\n\n4. **Compare with Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Bruno Brand\u00e3o from Brazil has a snatch of 157.0 kg, which matches the data in Row 4.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is TRUE based on the information provided in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate Bruno Brand\u00e3o's row by identifying 'bruno brand\u00e3o ( bra )' as his name and country code.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to analyze the table and verify two parts of the statement:\n\n1. Identify if there is only one person with a snatch weight of 153.0 kg.\n2. Check if that same person has a bodyweight of 104.70 kg.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify all entries with a snatch of 153.0 kg:**\n   - From the table, scan each row for the \"snatch\" column to find an entry equal to 153.0 kg.\n   - Row 5 has a snatch value of 153.0 kg for Christian L\u00f3pez.\n\n2. **Verify if there is only one person with a snatch of 153.0 kg:**\n   - Check other rows to ensure no other entries have a snatch weight of 153.0 kg.\n   - Rows 1-4, 6-11 do not have a snatch value of 153.0 kg.\n\n3. **Check the bodyweight for the person with a snatch of 153.0 kg:**\n   - For Row 5 (Christian L\u00f3pez), verify the \"bodyweight\" column.\n   - The bodyweight is listed as 104.7 kg.\n\n4. **Confirm that no other entries have both conditions simultaneously:**\n   - Since only Christian L\u00f3pez has a snatch of 153.0 kg, and his bodyweight matches the claim, there are no other entries to consider.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that \"there be only 1 person with a snatch of 153.0 and his total bodyweight be 104.70\". Based on our analysis:\n\n- There is indeed only one person with a snatch of 153.0 kg (Christian L\u00f3pez).\n- His bodyweight matches the specified value of 104.7 kg.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification are from Row 5: \n- Snatch column\n- Bodyweight column\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify all entries with a snatch weight of 153.0 kg.\",\n    \"Row 5 has a snatch value of 153.0 kg (Christian L\u00f3pez).\",\n    \"Verify that no other rows have a snatch value of 153.0 kg.\",\n    \"Check the bodyweight for Christian L\u00f3pez in Row 5, which is 104.7 kg.\",\n    \"Confirm there are no other entries with both conditions.\",\n    \"The claim is true as only one person meets both criteria.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"snatch\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"bodyweight\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
