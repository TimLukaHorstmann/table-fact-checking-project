    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Vaughan Coveny's caps is true or false, we need to analyze his career details from the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - The claim pertains to Vaughan Coveny. We locate Row 1 for his data.\n   - According to the table:\n     - Career span: 1992 - 2006\n     - Total caps: 64\n     - First cap: 7 June 1992\n     - Most recent cap: 4 June 2006\n\n2. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states he had a cap during his second year and third year with the team.\n   - It also claims he accumulated 19 caps throughout his years.\n\n3. **Determine Caps in Specific Years:**\n   - **Second Year:** \n     - His career started on 7 June 1992, so his second year would be from 1993 to sometime in 1994.\n     - Since his total caps are 64 over 14 years (1992-2006), it is reasonable to assume he had at least one cap during each year of his career. Thus, he likely had a cap during his second year.\n\n   - **Third Year:**\n     - His third year would be from 1994 to sometime in 1995.\n     - Similarly, given the distribution of caps over many years and his total number (64), it is reasonable to assume he had at least one cap during his third year as well.\n\n4. **Evaluate Total Caps Claim:**\n   - The claim states he had a total of 19 caps throughout his career.\n   - According to the table, Vaughan Coveny actually has 64 caps, not 19.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The statement about having caps during his second and third years is likely true based on typical career progression and distribution of caps over time.\n   - However, the total number of caps claimed (19) is incorrect according to the table data (64).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim is false because the total number of caps stated in the claim does not match the actual number provided in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim about Vaughan Coveny having a cap during his second and third years is likely true due to typical career progression.
