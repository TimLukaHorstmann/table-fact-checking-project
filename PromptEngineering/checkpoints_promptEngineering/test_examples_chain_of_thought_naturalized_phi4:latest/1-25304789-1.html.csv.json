    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify if both episodes \"A Modest Proposal\" and \"No Strings Attached\" were aired on August 10, 2010. Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify Information for \"A Modest Proposal\":**\n   - Look at each row in the table to find the episode titled \"A Modest Proposal.\"\n   - From Row 1: \n     - Episode title is \"A Modest Proposal.\"\n     - US Air Date is August 3, 2010.\n\n2. **Identify Information for \"No Strings Attached\":**\n   - Look at each row in the table to find the episode titled \"No Strings Attached.\"\n   - From Row 2: \n     - Episode title is \"No Strings Attached.\"\n     - US Air Date is August 3, 2010.\n\n3. **Compare the Dates:**\n   - For \"A Modest Proposal,\" the air date is August 3, 2010.\n   - For \"No Strings Attached,\" the air date is also August 3, 2010.\n   - Neither episode was aired on August 10, 2010.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that both episodes were aired on August 10, 2010. Based on the data from the table, this is incorrect because both episodes were actually aired on August 3, 2010.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Row 1: \"us air date\" column for \"A Modest Proposal.\"\n- Row 2: \"us air date\" column for \"No Strings Attached.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The episode 'A Modest Proposal' aired on August 3, 2010, and the episode 'No Strings Attached' also aired on August 3, 2010.
