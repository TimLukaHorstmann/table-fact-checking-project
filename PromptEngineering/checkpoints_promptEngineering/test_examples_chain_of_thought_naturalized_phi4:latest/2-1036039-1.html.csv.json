    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, let's break down the task step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that \"the result of the 1990 world cup qualify competition be 1 - 0\". This means we need to check if there is any entry in the table where the competition was related to the \"1990 World Cup qualifying\" and the result was exactly \"1 - 0\".\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Rows**: We need to find rows that mention a competition related to the \"1990 World Cup qualifying\". In the context of this task, we are looking for competitions directly labeled as such.\n\n3. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: \n     - Date: May 19, 1985\n     - Venue: Torrance, California\n     - Score: 1 - 0\n     - Result: 1 - 0\n     - Competition: 1986 World Cup Qualifying\n     - This row does not mention the \"1990 World Cup qualifying\".\n\n   - **Row 2**: \n     - Date: November 19, 1989\n     - Venue: Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago\n     - Score: 1 - 0\n     - Result: 1 - 0\n     - Competition: 1990 World Cup Qualifying\n     - This row is relevant because it mentions the \"1990 World Cup qualifying\" competition. The result here is \"1 - 0\", which matches the claim.\n\n   - **Row 3**: \n     - Date: March 10, 1990\n     - Venue: Tampa, Florida\n     - Score: 1 - 0\n     - Result: 2 - 1\n     - Competition: Friendly\n     - This row is not relevant as it mentions a \"friendly\" competition.\n\n   - **Row 4**: \n     - Date: June 10, 1990\n     - Venue: Florence, Italy\n     - Score: 1 - 3\n     - Result: 1 - 5\n     - Competition: 1990 World Cup\n     - This row mentions the \"1990 World Cup\", not the qualifying competition.\n\n   - **Row 5**: \n     - Date: May 28, 1995\n     - Venue: Tampa, Florida\n     - Score: 1 - 1\n     - Result: 1 - 2\n     - Competition: Friendly\n     - This row is also not relevant as it mentions a \"friendly\" competition.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The only relevant row for the \"1990 World Cup qualifying\" competition is Row 2, which indeed has a result of \"1 - 0\".
