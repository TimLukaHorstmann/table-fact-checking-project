    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to examine the metric values for each character in the table and identify which ones are measured in grams (g).\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Metric Values:**\n   - The metric value column specifies the measurement unit used for each character.\n\n2. **Identify Units of Measurement:**\n   - From Row 1 to Row 6, check the units provided in the \"metric value\" column:\n     - Row 1 (\u5398): 37.79931 mg\n     - Row 2 (\u5206): 377.9936375 mg\n     - **Row 3 (\u9322): 3.779936375 g**\n     - **Row 4 (\u5169): 37.79936375 g**\n     - **Row 5 (\u65a4): 604.78982 g**\n     - Row 6 (\u62c5/\u64d4): 60.478982 kg\n\n3. **Analyze the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"\u9322\" and \"\u65a4\" are the only characters with metric values measured in grams.\n   - From our analysis:\n     - \"\u9322\" has a metric value of 3.779936375 g.\n     - \"\u65a4\" has a metric value of 604.78982 g.\n     - \"\u5169\" also has a metric value of 37.79936375 g, which is in grams.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is incorrect because \"\u5169\" also has its metric value measured in grams, not just \"\u9322\" and \"\u65a4\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table provides metric values for each character. Upon examining these values, it is clear that '\u9322' and '\u65a4' have their metric values in grams, but so does '\u5169'. Therefore, the claim that only '\u9322' and '\u65a4' are measured in grams is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"metric value\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"metric value\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"metric value\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
