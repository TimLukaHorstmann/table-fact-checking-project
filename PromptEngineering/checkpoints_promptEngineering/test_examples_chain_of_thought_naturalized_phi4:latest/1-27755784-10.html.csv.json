    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"in March 2011 David Lee scored the most rebounds on the Golden State Warriors team\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine each game played by the Golden State Warriors during March 2011 as recorded in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Games**: We will review all games listed in March 2011.\n   - The games are from Row 2 to Row 17, covering dates from March 2 to March 29, 2011.\n\n2. **Check High Rebounds for Each Game**:\n   - For each game, check the \"high rebounds\" column to see who had the most rebounds and how many they had.\n   - We need to determine if David Lee consistently scored the most rebounds in these games.\n\n3. **Game Analysis**:\n   - **Row 2 (March 2)**: High Rebounds = David Lee (16)\n   - **Row 3 (March 4)**: High Rebounds = David Lee (12)\n   - **Row 4 (March 6)**: High Rebounds = David Lee (14)\n   - **Row 5 (March 8)**: High Rebounds = David Lee, Monta Ellis (14 each)\n   - **Row 6 (March 9)**: High Rebounds = David Lee (10)\n   - **Row 7 (March 11)**: High Rebounds = David Lee, Monta Ellis, Dorell Wright (6 each)\n   - **Row 8 (March 13)**: High Rebounds = Stephen Curry (9)\n   - **Row 9 (March 14)**: High Rebounds = David Lee, Vladimir Radmanovi\u0107 (4 each)\n   - **Row 10 (March 16)**: High Rebounds = David Lee (9)\n   - **Row 11 (March 18)**: High Rebounds = David Lee (10)\n   - **Row 12 (March 20)**: High Rebounds = David Lee (12)\n   - **Row 13 (March 21)**: High Rebounds = David Lee (9)\n   - **Row 14 (March 23)**: High Rebounds = David Lee (9)\n   - **Row 15 (March 25)**: High Rebounds = David Lee (7)\n   - **Row 16 (March 27)**: High Rebounds = David Lee (12)\n   - **Row 17 (March 29)**: High Rebounds = David Lee (15)\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - In every game except for Row 8, David Lee either scored the most rebounds or was tied with someone else.\n   - Therefore, throughout March 2011, David Lee consistently had the highest or tied for the highest rebounds in each game.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim is TRUE.
