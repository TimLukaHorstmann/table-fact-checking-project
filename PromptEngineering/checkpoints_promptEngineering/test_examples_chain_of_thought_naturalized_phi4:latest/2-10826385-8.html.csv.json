    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's evaluate each part of the claim based on the provided table.\n\n**Claim Analysis:**\n\nThe claim states that the games at VFL Park, Lake Oval, and Arden Street Oval all had crowds with fewer than 20,000 people. We will verify this by checking the \"crowd\" column for each specified venue.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **VFL Park:**\n   - According to Row 6 in the table:\n     - Venue: VFL Park\n     - Crowd: 25,845\n   - The crowd size at VFL Park is 25,845, which is more than 20,000.\n\n2. **Lake Oval:**\n   - According to Row 3 in the table:\n     - Venue: Lake Oval\n     - Crowd: 12,421\n   - The crowd size at Lake Oval is 12,421, which is less than 20,000.\n\n3. **Arden Street Oval:**\n   - According to Row 4 in the table:\n     - Venue: Arden Street Oval\n     - Crowd: 14,091\n   - The crowd size at Arden Street Oval is 14,091, which is less than 20,000.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim specifies that all three venues (VFL Park, Lake Oval, and Arden Street Oval) had crowds with fewer than 20,000 people. However, we found that the crowd at VFL Park was 25,845, which contradicts the claim. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that games at VFL Park, Lake Oval, and Arden Street Oval had crowds fewer than 20,000.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the 6 game list be all set on may 25, 1972\" is true or false, we need to examine each row of the table and focus specifically on the column named \"date.\" Here are the steps involved in verifying this claim:\n\n1. **Identify the Column:** The relevant column for checking the date of each game is the \"date\" column.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row's Date:**\n   - **Row 1:** Date is 20 May 1972.\n   - **Row 2:** Date is 20 May 1972.\n   - **Row 3:** Date is 20 May 1972.\n   - **Row 4:** Date is 20 May 1972.\n   - **Row 5:** Date is 20 May 1972.\n   - **Row 6:** Date is 20 May 1972.\n\n3. **Compare Dates with the Claimed Date:** The claim states that all games were set on 25 May 1972.
