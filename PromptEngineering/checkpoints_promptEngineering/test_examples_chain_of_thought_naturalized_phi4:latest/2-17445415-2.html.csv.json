    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Kelly Dullanty's wins is true or false, let's break down the components of the claim and verify them against the table data:\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **\"2 of kelly dullanty's win be by decision\":**\n   - We need to identify all rows where the result (\"res\") is a \"win.\"\n   - Count how many of these wins were by \"decision.\"\n\n2. **\"and each last at least 3 rounds in location nevada, united states\":**\n   - For those wins identified as \"by decision,\" check if they lasted at least 3 rounds.\n   - Verify that the location for these fights was Nevada, United States.\n\n### Steps to Evaluate:\n\n1. **Identify Wins:**\n   - Row 3: Result is a win (4-0 against Nuri Shakir).\n   - Row 4: Result is a win (3-0 against Rudy Vallederas).\n   - Row 5: Result is a win (2-0 against Duane Ludwig).\n   - Row 6: Result is a win (1-0 against Shad Smith).\n\n2. **Count Wins by Decision:**\n   - Row 3: Method is \"decision.\"\n   - Row 5: Method is \"decision.\"\n   - Therefore, there are 2 wins by decision.\n\n3. **Check Rounds and Location for Each Decision Win:**\n   - For Row 3:\n     - Round: 4 (lasts at least 3 rounds).\n     - Location: California, United States (not Nevada).\n\n   - For Row 5:\n     - Round: 3 (lasts at least 3 rounds).\n     - Location: Michigan, United States (not Nevada).\n\n### Conclusion:\n- While there are 2 wins by decision, neither of these occurred in Nevada. Both took place in different locations.\n\nBased on the above analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Identified all win results from the table. 2.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Kelly's third win being against Rudy Vallederas by TKO, but outside of a typical round, is true or false, we need to analyze the table data step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Kelly's Wins**: \n   - We will first identify all the rows in which Kelly has a result of \"win\".\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 3: Win against Nuri Shakir.\n     - Row 4: Win against Rudy Vallederas.\n     - Row 5: Win against Duane Ludwig.\n     - Row 6: Win against Shad Smith.\n\n2. **Determine the Order of Wins**:\n   - To find Kelly's third win, we need to list these wins in order based on their records which indicate the sequence of fights.\n   - According to the \"record\" column:\n     - Row 6: Record 1-0 (First Win)\n     - Row 5: Record 2-0 (Second Win)\n     - Row 4: Record 3-0 (Third Win)\n     - Row 3: Record 4-0 (Fourth Win)\n\n3. **Identify the Third Win**:\n   - Kelly's third win is against Rudy Vallederas, as indicated by Row 4 with a record of 3-0.\n\n4. **Method and Round Details for the Third Win**:\n   - From Row 4: \n     - Method: TKO\n     - Round: N/A (not specified)\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Kelly's third win was against Rudy Vallederas by TKO, but outside of a typical round.\n   - Since the \"round\" is listed as \"N/A\", it implies that the fight did not end in a standard numbered round (like rounds 1, 2, etc.), supporting the idea of being \"outside of the typical round\".\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim accurately describes Kelly's third win as against Rudy Vallederas by TKO and outside of a typical round.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify all rows where Kelly has a result of 'win'.\",\n    \"Determine the sequence of wins using the 'record' column.\",\n    \"Kelly's third win corresponds to Row 4 with a record of 3-0 against Rudy Vallederas.\",\n    \"Check the method and round details for this win: Method is TKO, Round is N/A.\",\n    \"Since the round is not specified (N/A), it supports being 'outside of the typical round'.\",\n    \"Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
