    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Episodes 1 and 2 of the Season:**\n   - Episode 1: Row 1 (no in series: 24, no in season: 1)\n   - Episode 2: Row 2 (no in series: 25, no in season: 2)\n\n2. **Calculate Total US Viewers for Episodes 1 and 2:**\n   - Episode 1 US viewers: 15.07 million\n   - Episode 2 US viewers: 15.75 million\n   - Combined total = 15.07 + 15.75 = 30.82 million\n\n3. **Compare with All Other Possible Combinations of Two Episodes:**\n   - We need to check each possible pair of episodes (from Row 1 to Row 22) and calculate their combined US viewers.\n\n4. **Calculate Combined Viewers for Each Pair:**\n   - For simplicity, we will only list the pairs that exceed or are close to 30.82 million:\n     - Episodes 5 & 6: 15.53 + 16.21 = 31.74 million\n     - Episodes 7 & 18: 14.11 + 16.32 = 30.43 million\n     - Episodes 9 & 10: 15.86 + 14.87 = 30.73 million\n\n5. **Determine the Maximum Combined Viewership:**\n   - The maximum combined viewership from any two episodes is 31.74 million (Episodes 5 and 6).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since 31.74 million (Episodes 5 & 6) is greater than 30.82 million (Episodes 1 & 2), the claim is false.\n\nHere is the final JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified episodes 1 and 2 of the season and calculated their combined US viewership as 30.82 million. Compared this with all other pairs of episodes, finding that Episodes 5 and 6 have a higher combined viewership of 31.74 million.
