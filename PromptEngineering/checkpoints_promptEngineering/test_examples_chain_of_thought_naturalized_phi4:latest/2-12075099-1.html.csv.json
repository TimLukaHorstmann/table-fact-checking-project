    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"rattler be the opponent team at the bishop kearney field\" is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant columns**: The claim mentions an opponent team (\"rattlers\") and a specific field (\"bishop kearney field\"). Therefore, we need to examine both the \"opponent\" column and the \"field\" column.\n\n2. **Examine each row in the table**:\n   - Look for rows where the \"field\" is \"bishop kearney field\".\n   - For those rows, check if the \"opponent\" is \"rattlers\".\n\n3. **Check Row 7**: \n   - Date: July 9\n   - Opponent: rattlers\n   - Home/Away: away\n   - Field: bishop kearney field\n   - Result: w 26 - 15\n\nIn Row 7, the \"field\" is indeed \"bishop kearney field\" and the \"opponent\" is \"rattlers\".
