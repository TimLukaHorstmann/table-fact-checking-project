    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"in the 1981 open championship no player finished under par\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data from the table:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understanding 'Under Par'**: \n   - In golf terminology, finishing \"under par\" means a score less than the standard number of strokes expected (par) for the course. The term is often represented by negative numbers or symbols like \"-\" or \"\u2212\".\n   \n2. **Examine Each Player's 'To Par' Score**:\n   - Row 1: Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez, To Par: E\n     - \"E\" stands for Even Par, meaning the player finished exactly at par.\n   - Row 2: Nick Job, To Par: E\n     - Similarly, \"E\" means Even Par.\n   - Rows 3 to 8: All players have a To Par score of +1.\n     - A \"+1\" indicates that these players finished one stroke over par (i.e., above par).\n   - Rows 9 to 16: All players have a To Par score of +2.\n     - A \"+2\" means they finished two strokes over par.\n\n3. **Conclusion from Analysis**:\n   - Each player listed has either an Even Par (E) or is Over Par (+1, +2). There are no negative values or symbols indicating Under Par.\n\n4. **Final Evaluation of the Claim**:\n   - Since no player in the table has a \"To Par\" score that indicates they finished under par (like \u22121, \u22122, etc.), the claim that \"no player finished under par\" is supported by the data provided.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells are all those containing the 'to par' information:\n\n- Row 1: `to par: e`\n- Row 2: `to par: e`\n- Rows 3 to 8: `to par: +1`\n- Rows 9 to 16: `to par: +2`\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Understand that 'under par' means a score lower than the expected strokes for the course, often indicated by negative values.\",\n    \"Examine each player's 'To Par' score in the table.\",\n    \"Identify if any players have a To Par score indicating under par (negative value or symbol).\",\n    \"All listed scores are Even Par (E) or Over Par (+1, +2), with no indications of Under Par.\",\n    \"Therefore, the claim that 'no player finished under par' is true.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Scores are often reported as \"to par,\" which indicates how much above or below the expected standard (par) a player scored.\n   - According to the table:\n     - Row 1 and Row 2 have players with scores of 70 (\"to par: e\"), indicating they scored even with par, which is better than scoring +1, +2, etc.\n     - Therefore, the lowest score in the tournament is 70.\n\n4. **Checking for Ties at the Winning Score**:\n   - Since the winning score is 70 (as per rows 1 and 2), we check how many players have this score.\n   - Rows 1 and 2 show two players (Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez and Nick Job) both scoring 70.\n\n5. **Conclusion Based on Analysis**:\n   - The claim that the winning score was 72 is incorrect because the actual winning score was 70.\n   - However, it is true that there were two players tied for the winning score of 70.\n\n6. **Final Determination**:\n   - The claim is false because the stated winning score (72) does not match the actual winning score (70).\n\nRelevant cells for this analysis are rows where scores and places are mentioned:\n\n- Row 1: place (\"t1\"), player (\"vicente fern\u00e3\u00a1ndez\"), score (\"70\"), to par (\"e\")\n- Row 2: place (\"t1\"), player (\"nick job\"), score (\"70\"), to par (\"e\")\n\nThus, the JSON output is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that the winning score was 72 with two players tied.

However, this does not qualify as under par.\n\n5. **Verification of the Claim:**\n   - Since no players are listed with a to par value indicating they finished under par (i.e., less than 0), and Isao Aoki finishes at +1, the claim is accurate.\n   - Therefore, the statement \"no player finish under par except Isao Aoki\" holds true because there were no players finishing under par.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that no player finished under par except Isao Aoki.
