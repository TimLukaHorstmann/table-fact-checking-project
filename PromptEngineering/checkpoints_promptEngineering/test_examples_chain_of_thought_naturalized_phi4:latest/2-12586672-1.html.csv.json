    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"player in the 1937 master tournament have to play 4 round\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table's data regarding the players' scores.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Score Format:** Each player's score is given as a sum of four numbers (e.g., Byron Nelson's score is 66 + 72 + 75 + 70 = 283). This indicates that each number represents an individual round in the tournament.\n\n2. **Interpreting the Scores:**\n   - The table lists scores for each player, which are broken down into four components.\n   - For example:\n     - Byron Nelson's score is detailed as 66 + 72 + 75 + 70 = 283.\n     - Ralph Guldahl's score is listed as 69 + 72 + 68 + 76 = 285.\n\n3. **Total Rounds Inferred:**\n   - Since each player's total score consists of four components, it implies that there are four rounds in the tournament.\n   - This pattern holds for all players listed in the table (e.g., Ed Dudley's score is 70 + 71 + 71 + 74 = 286).\n\n4. **Conclusion:** \n   - The structure of each player's score being a sum of four numbers indicates that the tournament consisted of four rounds.\n   - Therefore, the claim that players in the 1937 Masters Tournament had to play 4 rounds is supported by the data provided.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- All rows and columns under \"score\" are relevant as they show the breakdown into four components for each player. Specifically:\n  - Row 1, Score: 66 + 72 + 75 + 70 = 283\n  - Row 2, Score: 69 + 72 + 68 + 76 = 285\n  - Row 3, Score: 70 + 71 + 71 + 74 = 286\n  - Row 4, Score: 73 + 69 + 71 + 74 = 287\n  - Row 5, Score: 73 + 70 + 74 + 73 = 290\n  - Row 6, Score: 71 + 73 + 74 + 73 = 291\n  - Row 7, Score: 74 + 72 + 71 + 75 = 292\n  - Row 8, Score: 73 + 75 + 73 + 72 = 293\n  - Row 9, Score: 72 + 72 + 72 + 77 = 293\n  - Row 10, Score: 71 + 75 + 71 + 77 = 294\n  - Row 11, Score: 77 + 72 + 68 + 77 = 294\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Each player's score is a sum of four components, indicating four rounds were played.

The presence of four individual scores indicates four rounds.\n\n3. **Checking Consistency Across Rows**:\n   - Row 1 to Row 11 all list scores in the format of four numbers separated by plus signs, indicating scores from four rounds.\n   \n4. **Verification with Place and Scores**:\n   - Each player's total score is calculated as the sum of these four round scores, confirming that each player played four rounds (e.g., 66 + 72 + 75 + 70 = 283 for Byron Nelson).\n\n5. **Conclusion on Rounds Played**:\n   - Since all players have their scores broken down into four rounds and no additional round is mentioned or implied in the table, we conclude that players in this tournament played four rounds.\n\n6. **Final Assessment of Claim**:\n   - The claim states that players had to play 5 rounds.
