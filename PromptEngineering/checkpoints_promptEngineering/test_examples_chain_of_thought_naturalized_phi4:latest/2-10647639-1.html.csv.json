Here's how I will approach this:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Opponents**: We must find entries where the opponent is identified as the \"new york jets\", since they were historically known as the \"new york patriots\" before 1978.\n\n2. **Check Game Results Against New York Jets**:\n   - Locate any rows in the table with \"opponent: new york jets\".\n   - Review the \"result\" column to see if there is a win (\"w\") or loss (\"l\") recorded for those games.\n  \n3. **Verification of Wins**:\n   - If there is at least one game where the Bills won against the New York Jets, then the claim would be false.\n   - If no such wins are present, then the claim would be true.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to the table:\n\n- **Row 7**: \n  - Opponent: new york jets\n  - Result: w 20 - 13 (This indicates a win for the Bills)\n\n- **Row 12**:\n  - Opponent: new york jets\n  - Result: l 16 - 13 (This indicates a loss for the Bills)\n\nFrom these observations, we see that there was one game where the Bills won against the New York Jets.
