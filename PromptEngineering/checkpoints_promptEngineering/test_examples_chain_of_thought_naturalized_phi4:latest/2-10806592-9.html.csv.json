The table provides both home and away teams' scores for several matches.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - We need to focus on the \"away team score\" column in each row to check how many games had an away team score less than 10 goals (50 points).\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: Away team is Hawthorn with a score of 6.13, which translates to 49 points.\n     - Score < 50? Yes.\n   - **Row 2**: Away team is South Melbourne with a score of 8.8, translating to 56 points.\n     - Score < 50? No.\n   - **Row 3**: Away team is Melbourne with a score of 16.16, translating to 112 points.\n     - Score < 50? No.\n   - **Row 4**: Away team is Essendon with a score of 15.9, translating to 99 points.\n     - Score < 50? No.\n   - **Row 5**: Away team is Collingwood with a score of 10.5, translating to 65 points.\n     - Score < 50? No.\n   - **Row 6**: Away team is Carlton with a score of 16.25, translating to 121 points.\n     - Score < 50? No.\n\n3. **Count Teams with Scores Less Than 10 Goals**:\n   - Only Hawthorn (Row 1) has an away team score less than 50 points.\n   - South Melbourne (Row 2) does not have a score below 50 points.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states \"only 2 teams (Hawthorn and South Melbourne) scored less than 10 goals.\"\n   - Our analysis shows only Hawthorn met this criterion, while South Melbourne did not.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe final answer is that the claim is FALSE because only one team (Hawthorn) had a score of less than 50 points. South Melbourne does not meet this criterion.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Examine each row's away team scores to see if they are less than 10 goals (50 points).

Since we're only concerned with the goal count for this claim, we note that the team scored exactly 11 goals.\n\n2. **Row 2:** \n   - Home Team: Fitzroy\n   - Home Score: 16.12 (108)\n   - Analysis: The first number is 16, indicating the team scored more than 11 goals.\n\n3. **Row 3:** \n   - Home Team: St Kilda\n   - Home Score: 14.12 (96)\n   - Analysis: The first number is 14, indicating the team scored more than 11 goals.\n\n4. **Row 4:** \n   - Home Team: Richmond\n   - Home Score: 15.14 (104)\n   - Analysis: The first number is 15, indicating the team scored more than 11 goals.\n\n5. **Row 5:** \n   - Home Team: Footscray\n   - Home Score: 13.9 (87)\n   - Analysis: The first number is 13, indicating the team scored more than 11 goals.\n\n6. **Row 6:** \n   - Home Team: North Melbourne\n   - Home Score: 11.5 (71)\n   - Analysis: The first number is 11, meaning they scored exactly 11 goals.\n\nNow we compare these findings against the claim that \"there be no home team that score more than 11.\"\n\n- From Rows 2, 3, 4, and 5, it's evident there are instances where home teams have scored more than 11 goals.\n  \nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because multiple rows show home teams with scores exceeding 11 goals.\n\nFinal output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We analyzed each row to find the number of goals scored by home teams.

The formula for total points is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Points} = (A \\times 6) + B + C\n     \\]\n\n3. **List Total Scores:**\n   - Calculate the total scores for each team in all games on June 18, 1938.\n\n4. **Compare Scores:**\n   - Arrange these scores in descending order to find out which team has the highest and second-highest score.\n   \n5. **Verify Carlton's Score Position:**\n   - Check if Carlton is indeed the team with the second highest score.\n\n### Calculations:\n\n- **Row 1:** \n  - Geelong: \\(11 \\times 6 + 23 = 89\\)\n  - Hawthorn: \\(6 \\times 6 + 13 = 49\\)\n\n- **Row 2:** \n  - Fitzroy: \\(16 \\times 6 + 12 = 108\\)\n  - South Melbourne: \\(8 \\times 6 + 8 = 56\\)\n\n- **Row 3:** \n  - St Kilda: \\(14 \\times 6 + 12 = 96\\)\n  - Melbourne: \\(16 \\times 6 + 16 = 112\\)\n\n- **Row 4:** \n  - Richmond: \\(15 \\times 6 + 14 = 104\\)\n  - Essendon: \\(15 \\times 6 + 9 = 99\\)\n\n- **Row 5:** \n  - Footscray: \\(13 \\times 6 + 9 = 87\\)\n  - Collingwood: \\(10 \\times 6 + 5 = 65\\)\n\n- **Row 6:** \n  - North Melbourne: \\(11 \\times 6 + 5 = 71\\)\n  - Carlton: \\(16 \\times 6 + 25 = 121\\)\n\n### Ordering Scores:\n\n1.
