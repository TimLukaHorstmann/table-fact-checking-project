It is considered a transcontinental country.\n   - **Estonia**: Located in Northern Europe on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea, it is often considered part of Eastern Europe due to its historical and cultural ties with the region.\n   - **Czech Republic**: Located in Central Europe, not typically classified as Eastern Europe.\n\n3. **Identify Countries from Eastern Europe:**\n   - Based on the analysis:\n     - **Russia** can be partially considered part of Eastern Europe.\n     - **Estonia** is often regarded as part of Eastern Europe due to its geographical and historical context.\n\n4. **Count the Number of Eastern European Countries:**\n   - We identified two countries that are associated with Eastern Europe: Russia and Estonia.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states there is \"only 1 country listed in Eastern Europe,\" but our analysis shows there are actually two such countries (Russia and Estonia).
