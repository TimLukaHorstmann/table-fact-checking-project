    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, let's break down the statement and analyze it using the data from the table.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n\"The last 4 games in season 5 were held in Los Angeles and London.\"\n\n**Steps to Evaluate:**\n\n1. **Identify \"Season 5\":**\n   - The seasons are listed with a range format like \"1997 - 98\", which indicates that each season covers two calendar years (e.g., the majority of 1997 and all of 1998).\n   - Therefore, \"season 5\" corresponds to the period from 2003 to 2004.\n\n2. **List Events in Season 5:**\n   - Extract rows for events occurring during the \"2003-04\" season.\n   - Relevant rows:\n     - Row 15: Event type is Nationals, location is Osaka.\n     - Row 16: Event type is Grand Prix, location is Kuala Lumpur.\n\n3. **Check Last Four Events:**\n   - From the table, only two events are listed for \"season 5\" (2003-04).\n   - Therefore, it's impossible for there to be four events in that season alone.\n\n4. **Evaluate Locations:**\n   - The claim specifies locations as Los Angeles and London.\n   - Check if any of these cities appear in the events from \"season 5\":\n     - Row 15: Location is Osaka (not Los Angeles or London).\n     - Row 16: Location is Kuala Lumpur (not Los Angeles or London).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - There are only two events listed for season 5, not four.\n   - None of the events in season 5 were held in Los Angeles or London.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim that \"the last 4 games in season 5 be hold in los angeles and london\" is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim refers to 'season 5', which corresponds to 2003-04.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"there be 10 event in 2011\" is true or false, we need to examine the table for entries corresponding to the year 2011.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: We are interested in events that took place during the season of 2011.\n2. **Examine Each Row**: Check each row's \"season\" column to see if it matches the year 2011.\n3. **Count the Matches**: Count how many rows have the \"season\" value as 2011.\n\n**Detailed Examination:**\n\n- **Row 21**: The season is listed as 2011. This row corresponds to a Pro Tour event in Nagoya with a block constructed and booster draft format, dated 10 - 12 June 2011, ranked 5.\n  \nNo other rows have the \"season\" value of 2011.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Only one row (Row 21) matches the season 2011.
