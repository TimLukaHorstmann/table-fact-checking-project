    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Corey Peters being the only defensive tackle selected with a pick number of 19 is true, let's analyze the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim**: The claim states that Corey Peters is the only player selected as a defensive tackle with a pick number of 19.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row for Defensive Tackles**:\n   - **Row 1**: Sean Weatherspoon, Linebacker (Position: Linebacker). This does not match the position \"defensive tackle.\"\n   - **Row 2**: Corey Peters, Defensive Tackle (Position: Defensive Tackle).\n     - Check if the pick number is 19. The entry shows `pick: 19`, confirming it matches the claim.\n   - **Rows 3 to 7**: \n     - Mike Johnson (Guard), Joe Hawley (Guard), Dominique Franks (Cornerback), Kerry Meier (Wide Receiver), and Shann Schillinger (Safety). None of these positions match \"defensive tackle.\"\n\n3. **Verify Other Defensive Tackles**:\n   - After examining all rows, no other player is listed as a defensive tackle.\n   - Therefore, Corey Peters is indeed the only player in the table who is both a defensive tackle and has a pick number of 19.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The claim that Corey Peters is the only defensive tackle selected with a pick number of 19 is true based on the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was examined row by row to identify any players listed as 'defensive tackle.' Only Corey Peters in Row 2 matches this position. His pick number is indeed 19, confirming the claim.
