Weibring in the table.\n   - Row 5: Player \"Larry Mize\" has a score of 208 and is listed as being in place \"t5\".\n   - Row 6: Player \"D.A. Weibring\" also has a score of 208 and is listed as being in place \"t5\".\n\n2. **Understand the Place Notation:**\n   - The notation \"t5\" indicates that there are multiple players tied for 5th place.\n\n3. **Verify the Consistency with Scores and Par Values:**\n   - Both Larry Mize and D.A. Weibring have scores of 208, which is consistent with their place being tied for 5th.\n   - Their \"to par\" values are both \"-5\", further confirming they share the same standing relative to par.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since both players are listed as \"t5\" and have identical scores and \"to par\" values, it confirms that Larry Mize and D.A.
