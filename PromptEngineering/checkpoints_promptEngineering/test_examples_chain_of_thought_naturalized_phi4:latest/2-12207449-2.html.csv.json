    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the Blue Jays' shortest streak being a 0-1 game losing streak in April 1986 is true, we'll analyze each part of the claim based on the data provided:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: \n   - The claim states that the shortest losing streak for the Blue Jays in April 1986 was a \"0-1 game losing streak.\" This implies finding any sequence where they lost only one consecutive game and did not lose more than once in any other streak during this period.\n\n2. **Identify Losing Streaks**:\n   - A losing streak is defined as consecutive losses without an intervening win.\n   - We will examine the \"loss\" column to find sequences of consecutive games where there was a loss.\n\n3. **Analyze Each Row for Losses**:\n   - Review each row from April 8 to April 30, focusing on whether the game resulted in a loss and if it is part of a losing streak.\n\n4. **Identify Consecutive Losses**:\n   - From the data:\n     - April 8: Loss (Stieb) \u2014 Start of a potential streak.\n     - April 9: Loss (Correa) \u2014 Continues streak to 2 games.\n     - April 10: Loss (Harris) \u2014 Continues streak to 3 games.\n     - April 11: No loss (Win)\n     - April 12: Loss (Acker) \u2014 New streak of 1 game\n     - April 13: Loss (Stieb) \u2014 Continues streak to 2 games\n     - April 14: Loss (Alexander) \u2014 Continues streak to 3 games\n     - April 16: Postponed, not counted in the streak.\n     - April 17: Two games; losses by Key and Martinez \u2014 New streak of 1 game (Key) followed by another loss immediately after (Martinez)\n     - April 18: Loss (Stieb) \u2014 New streak of 1 game\n     - April 19: Loss (Black) \u2014 Continues streak to 2 games\n     - April 20: Loss (Lamp) \u2014 Continues streak to 3 games\n     - April 21: Loss (Harris) \u2014 New streak of 1 game\n     - April 22: Loss (Clancy) \u2014 New streak of 1 game\n     - April 23: Loss (Lamp) \u2014 New streak of 1 game\n     - April 25: Loss (Aase) \u2014 New streak of 1 game\n     - April 26: Loss (Henke) \u2014 New streak of 1 game\n     - April 27: Loss (Dixon) \u2014 New streak of 1 game\n     - April 29: Loss (Eichhorn) \u2014 New streak of 1 game\n     - April 30: Loss (Moore) \u2014 New streak of 1 game\n\n5. **Shortest Losing Streaks**:\n   - There are multiple single-game losing streaks throughout the month.\n   - The shortest possible losing streak is a \"0-1\" sequence, where they lost one game and then won or did not play in subsequent games.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the data analysis, there are several instances of 1-game losing streaks (e.g., April 12, April 18, April 21, etc.), indicating that a \"0-1\" losing streak is indeed the shortest possible sequence they experienced in April 1986.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells include rows where losses occurred and those with immediate wins or no play:\n\n- Rows indicating single-game losses (e.g., Row 5: loss by Acker, Row 8: postponed then win on April 17, etc.).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim is that the shortest losing streak for the Blue Jays in April 1986 was a '0-1' game losing streak.
