This does not match \"0 - 6 - 0\".\n   - **Row 2 (Class: c3)**: Wheels are \"0 - 6 - 0\". This matches the wheel configuration in question.\n   - **Row 3 (Class: i1)**: Wheels are \"4 - 4 - 2t\". This does not match \"0 - 6 - 0\".\n   - **Row 4 (Class: i2)**: Wheels are \"4 - 4 - 2t\". This does not match \"0 - 6 - 0\".\n   - **Row 5 (Class: i3)**: Wheels are \"4 - 4 - 2t\".
