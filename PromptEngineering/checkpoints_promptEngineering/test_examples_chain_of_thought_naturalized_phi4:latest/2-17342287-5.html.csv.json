    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true, we need to verify two main points from the table:\n1. Identify how many games were played at the \"BOSTON GARDEN\".\n2. Check if all those games occurred before December 17.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Games Played at Boston Garden:**\n   - Scan each row for the location/attendance column to find entries with \"boston garden\".\n\n2. **Count Those Games:**\n   - List and count these occurrences to see if there are exactly 8 games.\n\n3. **Check Dates of These Games:**\n   - Verify that all listed dates for these Boston Garden games occur before December 17.\n\n### Analyzing the Table\n\n- **Row 1**: Location is \"boston garden\" on December 3.\n- **Row 5**: Location is \"boston garden\" on December 8.\n- **Row 6**: Location is \"boston garden\" on December 11.\n- **Row 7**: Location is \"boston garden\" on December 15.\n\nThese are the games played at Boston Garden, and their dates (December 3, 8, 11, 15) are all before December 17.\n\n4. **Further Verification:**\n   - Continue checking rows beyond Row 7 for any additional \"boston garden\" entries up to Row 14.\n   \n- **Row 8**: Location is \"detroit\", not Boston Garden.\n- **Row 9**: Location is \"boston garden\" on December 22 (after December 17, so not counted).\n- **Row 10** to **Row 14**: Locations are different from Boston Garden.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFrom the table, there are only four games played at Boston Garden before December 17. Therefore, the claim that there were eight such games is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified games played at 'boston garden' and verified their dates.
