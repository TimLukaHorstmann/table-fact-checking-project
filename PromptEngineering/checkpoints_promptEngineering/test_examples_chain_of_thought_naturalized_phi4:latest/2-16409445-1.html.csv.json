The attendance listed is 40091.\n\n3. **Find Games Played in November 1997:**\n   - We need to identify all games played in November 1997. From the table:\n     - Row 10 (November 9, 1997) - Opponent: New Orleans Saints\n     - Row 11 (November 16, 1997) - Opponent: San Diego Chargers\n     - Row 12 (November 24, 1997) - Opponent: Denver Broncos\n\n4. **Check Attendance for Each November Game:**\n   - Compare the attendance figures for each of these games:\n     - Row 10 (New Orleans Saints): Attendance = 40091\n     - Row 11 (San Diego Chargers): Attendance = 65714\n     - Row 12 (Denver Broncos): Attendance = 75307\n\n5. **Determine the Game with the Least Attendance in November:**\n   - Among these games, the one against New Orleans Saints on November 9 has the lowest attendance at 40091.\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that when playing against the New Orleans Saints in November 1997, it had the least attendance of the season.\n   - We confirmed that this game indeed had the least attendance compared to all other games played in November and verified that no other game throughout the entire season (from August to December) has a lower attendance than 40091.\n\nBased on these steps, we can conclude that the claim is true.
