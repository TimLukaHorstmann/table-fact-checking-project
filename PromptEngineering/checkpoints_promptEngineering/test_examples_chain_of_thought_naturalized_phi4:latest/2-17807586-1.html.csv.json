    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"North Carolina produce 3 champion between 2003 and 2009\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data for any occurrences of winners from North Carolina (NC) during the specified years.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Years**: The claim specifies the years between 2003 and 2009. We will examine rows corresponding to these years:\n   - 2003: Row 11\n   - 2004: Row 10\n   - 2005: Row 9\n   - 2006: Row 8\n   - 2007: Row 7\n   - 2008: Row 6\n   - 2009: Row 5\n\n2. **Check for North Carolina Winners**: For each relevant year, we need to check if the winners are from North Carolina (NC).\n\n3. **Analyze Each Relevant Year**:\n   - **Row 11 (Year 2003)**: Winners are Nick Amphlett & John Zekowitz (MA). No NC winner.\n   - **Row 10 (Year 2004)**: Winners are Thomas Bao & Eric Johnston (CA). No NC winner.\n   - **Row 9 (Year 2005)**: Winners are Scott Cardone & Asif Rahman (OH). No NC winner.\n   - **Row 8 (Year 2006)**: Winners are Aaron Jacobs & Nathan Mendelsohn (MA). No NC winner.\n   - **Row 7 (Year 2007)**: Winners are Aune Mitchell & Matthew Silver (CT). No NC winner.\n   - **Row 6 (Year 2008)**: Winners are Logan Rosen & Matthew Silver (CT). No NC winner.\n   - **Row 5 (Year 2009)**: Winners are Andy Hoang & Erik Salgado (NC). This is one NC winner.\n\n4. **Count NC Winners**: From the analysis, there is only one instance of winners from North Carolina in the specified years (2009).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The claim states that there were three champions from North Carolina between 2003 and 2009. Based on our analysis, there was only one such instance.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table data for years 2003 to 2009 shows winners from North Carolina only in the year 2009 (Andy Hoang & Erik Salgado).
