    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze each part of the claim against the data provided in the table.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n\n1. **\"both fight with opponent shamil abdurahimov\"**\n   - We need to check if there are two fights listed in the table where \"shamil abdurahimov\" is the opponent.\n   \n2. **\"and houston alexander be win\"**\n   - We need to verify if there are two separate fights, one against \"shamil abdurahimov\" and another against \"houston alexander,\" both resulting in a win.\n\n3. **\"with method tko (punches) for both\"**\n   - For each of these fights, we must confirm that the result was a \"tko\" achieved through \"punches.\"\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Fights Against Shamil Abdurahimov:**\n   - Row 9: The opponent is \"shamil abdurahimov.\" The result is a loss, and the method is \"tko (punches).\"\n   - There is only one fight against \"shamil abdurahimov,\" not two.\n\n2. **Identify Fights Against Houston Alexander:**\n   - Row 10: The opponent is \"houston alexander.\" The result is a loss, and the method is \"tko (punches).\"\n   - There is only one fight against \"houston alexander,\" which was also a loss.\n\n3. **Verification of Win and Method for Both Fights:**\n   - Since there is only one fight each with \"shamil abdurahimov\" and \"houston alexander,\" both resulting in losses, the condition of winning both fights cannot be met.\n   - Additionally, neither of these fights was a win, so the method of \"tko (punches)\" as a winning method does not apply to either.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because:\n- There is only one fight against each opponent listed (\"shamil abdurahimov\" and \"houston alexander\").\n- Both fights resulted in losses, not wins.\n- The method of \"tko (punches)\" was used in both, but not as a winning method.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 9: Opponent is \"shamil abdurahimov,\" result is \"loss,\" and method is \"tko (punches).\"\n- Row 10: Opponent is \"houston alexander,\" result is \"loss,\" and method is \"tko (punches).\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires two fights with both opponents resulting in wins by 'tko (punches)'.

The claim specifically mentions Saitama (Japan), Birmingham (England), and Brisbane (Australia) as examples, so we will check these first.\n\n- **Row 13**: Event location is \"saitama , japan.\"\n- **Row 18**: Event location is \"birmingham , england.\"\n- **Row 11**: Event location is \"brisbane , australia.\"\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Matches in Saitama, Birmingham, and Brisbane\n- The match in Row 13 was held in Saitama, Japan.\n- The match in Row 18 was held in Birmingham, England.\n- The match in Row 11 was held in Brisbane, Australia.\n\nThese locations are indeed outside of the United States.\n\n### Step 3: Check for Other Matches Outside the United States\nTo confirm that the fighter has other matches outside the United States as well:\n\n- **Row 1**: Location is \"khabarovsk , russia.\"\n- **Row 2**: Location is \"brisbane , australia\" (already noted).\n- **Row 3**: Location is \"seoul , south korea.\"\n- **Row 4**: Location is \"singapore.\"\n- **Row 5**: Location is \"sydney , australia.\"\n- **Row 6**: Location is \"tokyo , japan.\"\n- **Row 7**: Location is \"saitama , japan\" (already noted).\n- **Row 9**: Location is \"yokohama , japan.\"\n- **Row 10**: Location is \"newark, new jersey , united states\" (inside the US, not relevant for this claim).\n- **Row 12**: Location is \"long beach , california , united states\" (inside the US, not relevant for this claim).\n\nFrom these additional checks, we can confirm that there are multiple matches outside of the United States.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe fighter indeed has matches in countries other than the United States, including Saitama (Japan), Birmingham (England), and Brisbane (Australia).
