The relevant column for this task is \"egyptian premier league.\"\n\nLet's go through each row of the table and identify players who have zero goals in the Egyptian Premier League:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Sherif Ashraf - 6 goals\n2. **Row 2**: Mahmoud Fathallah - 5 goals\n3. **Row 3**: Junior Agogo - 3 goals\n4. **Row 4**: Abdel Halim Ali - 3 goals\n5. **Row 5**: Hani Said - 3 goals\n6. **Row 6**: Shikabala - 3 goals\n7. **Row 7**: Gamal Hamza - 1 goal\n8. **Row 8**: Ahmed Magdy - 2 goals\n9. **Row 9**: Mostafa Gaafar - 2 goals\n10. **Row 10**: Alaa Kamal - 1 goal\n11. **Row 11**: Mahmoud Samir - 1 goal\n12. **Row 12**: Ricardo Alves Fernandes - 1 goal\n13. **Row 13**: Sabry Raheel - 1 goal\n14. **Row 14**: Wisam El Abdy - 1 goal\n15. **Row 15**: Amr El-Safty - 0 goals (relevant for the claim)\n16. **Row 16**: Own Goals - 1 goal\n\nNow, let's identify players with zero goals in the Egyptian Premier League:\n\n- **Row 15**: Amr El-Safty has 0 goals.\n- **Row 17**: Totals show that the total for the Egyptian Premier League is 34, which confirms there are other players contributing to this total. Since no other individual row shows zero except Row 15, we need to check if there's another player with zero goals not listed individually.\n\nSince Row 17 (totals) accounts for all goals and lists a total of 34 goals in the Egyptian Premier League, and no other player besides Amr El-Safty is explicitly shown with zero goals, it implies that any other potential players with zero goals are not listed individually. Therefore, based on the table provided, only Amr El-Safty is explicitly listed as having scored zero goals in the Egyptian Premier League.\n\nThus, the claim \"Amr El-Safty be only 1 of 2 player on the list to not score in the egyptian premier league\" is FALSE because there is no other player explicitly shown with zero goals.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify players who scored zero goals in the Egyptian Premier League by examining the 'egyptian premier league' column.\",\n    \"Rows 1-14 and Row 16 have non-zero values for the Egyptian Premier League.\",\n    \"Row 15 (Amr El-Safty) has a value of 0 for the Egyptian Premier League, confirming no goals scored in this league by him.\",\n    \"Row 17 confirms the total number of goals in the Egyptian Premier League is 34, which accounts for all listed players except those with zero goals not individually listed.\",\n    \"No other player besides Amr El-Safty is explicitly shown with zero goals in the table.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
