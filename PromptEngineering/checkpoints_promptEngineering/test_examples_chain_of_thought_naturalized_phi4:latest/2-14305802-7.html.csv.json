We need to find which row corresponds to this date.\n\n2. **Locate the Row with March 28**:\n   - Examine each row in the table for the \"march\" column value that matches 28.\n   - According to the table data:\n     - Row 13: game: 74, march: 28\n\n3. **Check the Opponent on March 28**:\n   - Once we identify the correct row (Row 13), look at the \"opponent\" column in this row.\n   - The opponent listed for Row 13 is \"colorado rockies.\"\n\n4. **Compare with the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the opponent on March 28 was the \"colorado rockies.\"\n   - Our examination shows that the opponent is indeed \"colorado rockies\" in Row 13.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since both the date and opponent match what is specified in the claim, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's summarize this reasoning in a JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the row where the month of March equals 28.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, let's go through a step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify the Date of Interest**: The claim concerns the opponent present on March 24.\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Entries**: We need to examine each row in the table and find any entry that corresponds to March 24. This involves checking the \"march\" column for the value \"24\".\n\n3. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: March is 1.\n   - **Row 2**: March is 4.\n   - **Row 3**: March is 5.\n   - **Row 4**: March is 7.\n   - **Row 5**: March is 11.\n   - **Row 6**: March is 12.\n   - **Row 7**: March is 15.\n   - **Row 8**: March is 16.\n   - **Row 9**: March is 18.\n   - **Row 10**: March is 20.\n   - **Row 11**: March is 23.\n   - **Row 12**: March is 25. (Next closest date after March 24)\n   - **Row 13**: March is 28.\n   - **Row 14**: March is 31.\n\n4. **Analyze the Findings**:\n   - There is no row where \"march\" equals 24, which means there is no entry for a game on March 24 in this table.\n\n5. **Conclusion Based on Analysis**:\n   - Since there is no record of a game played on March 24, it follows that there cannot be an opponent listed for that date.\n   - The claim states the opponent would be \"colorado rockies,\" but since no game occurred on March 24, this specific claim about the opponent is not applicable.\n\n6. **Determine the Truth Value**:\n   - Since no game took place on March 24, the statement about having an opponent (the Colorado Rockies) on that date is false.\n\nTherefore, based on the reasoning above, the final answer to the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was checked for any entry where 'march' equals 24. No such entry exists; therefore, no game or opponent is listed for March 24.
