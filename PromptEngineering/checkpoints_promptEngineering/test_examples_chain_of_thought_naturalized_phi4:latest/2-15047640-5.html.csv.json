    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the match report being listed as \"recap\" against Houston on December 14, 2008, is true or false, we need to examine the table for information related to a game played against Houston during that date.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Week and Date:**\n   - The claim specifies the opponent as \"Houston\" and the date as December 14, 2008.\n   - Check each row in the table for this specific combination of opponent and date.\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Row:**\n   - Look through the rows to find the one with:\n     - `opponent` column containing \"houston\"\n     - `date` column containing \"december 14, 2008\"\n\n3. **Verify Match Report Column for the Identified Row:**\n   - Once the relevant row is located, check if the `match report` column contains \"recap\".\n\n4. **Check the Table for Consistency:**\n   - The table has a clear structure with each game listed by week and corresponding details.\n   - Ensure that all columns are consistent with the identified opponent and date.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Row 14** of the table is:\n  - `week`: 14\n  - `date`: december 7 , 2008\n  - `opponent`: houston\n  - `time / time zone`: noon cst\n  - `game site`: lambeau field\n  - `final score`: l, 24 - 21\n  - `record`: 5 - 8\n  - `match report`: recap\n\n- **Row 14** shows a game against Houston on December 7, not December 14.\n\n- **Row 15** of the table is:\n  - `week`: 15\n  - `date`: december 14 , 2008\n  - `opponent`: jacksonville\n  - `time / time zone`: noon cst\n  - `game site`: jacksonville municipal stadium\n  - `final score`: l, 20 - 16\n  - `record`: 5 - 9\n  - `match report`: recap\n\n- **Row 15** shows a game against Jacksonville on December 14.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThere is no row in the table that matches both \"Houston\" as the opponent and \"December 14, 2008\" as the date. Therefore, there cannot be any match report for such a game.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim specifies a match against Houston on December 14, 2008.
