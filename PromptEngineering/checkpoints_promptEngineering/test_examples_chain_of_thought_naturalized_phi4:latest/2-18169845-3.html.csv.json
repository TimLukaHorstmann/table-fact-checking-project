Similar statements are made about Outer Critics Circle Awards.\n\n2. **Analyzing Tony Award Data:**\n   - We need to look at all rows related to the Tony Awards:\n     - Row 1: Andrew Lippa is a nominee in the category \"Best Original Score\" for a Tony Award and the result is \"nominated.\"\n     - Row 2: Kevin Chamberlin is a nominee in the category \"Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical\" for a Tony Award and the result is \"nominated.\"\n   - Both nominees are associated with \"The Addams Family Musical,\" as inferred from context.\n   - There are no rows indicating a win for any category under Tony Awards.\n\n3. **Analyzing Outer Critics Circle Award Data:**\n   - We need to look at all rows related to the Outer Critics Circle Awards:\n     - Row 15: Nathan Lane is nominated in the category \"Outstanding Actor in a Musical.\"\n     - Row 16: Bebe Neuwirth is nominated in the category \"Outstanding Actress in a Musical.\"\n     - Row 17: Kevin Chamberlin is nominated in the category \"Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical.\"\n     - Row 18: Carolee Carmello is nominated in the category \"Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical.\"\n   - There are no rows indicating a win for any category under Outer Critics Circle Awards.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim that \"The Addams Family Musical have not won any Tony Award, but be nominated for 2\" is true based on Rows 1 and 2.\n   - The claim that \"same with outer critic circle award\" (i.e., no wins but nominations) is also true as there are multiple nominations but no wins mentioned in Rows 15-18.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows two Tony Award nominations for 'The Addams Family Musical' with no wins.
