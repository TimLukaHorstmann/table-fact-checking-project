Here are the steps involved:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Years:**\n   - The claim involves a specific combination of individuals in particular roles for three consecutive years.\n   - The focus is on the roles:\n     - Lap-by-lap announcer: Bill Fleming\n     - Pit reporters: Chris Economaki\n     - Host: Bill Fleming\n\n2. **Review Each Row from 1960 to 1978:**\n   - We need to find instances where Bill Fleming serves as both lap-by-lap announcer and host, with Chris Economaki as the pit reporter.\n\n3. **Examine Table Rows for Relevant Combination:**\n   - **Row 3 (1963):** Bill Flemming is both the lap-by-lap announcer and host; Chris Economaki is the pit reporter.\n   - **Row 4 (1964):** Bill Flemming is both the lap-by-lap announcer and host; Chris Economaki is one of the pit reporters.\n   - **Row 5 (1965):** Bill Flemming is both the lap-by-lap announcer, pit reporter, and host. Although Bill Fleming also fulfills the role of pit reporter, the combination involves Chris Economaki in previous years.\n   - **Row 8 (1968), Row 9 (1969):** Similar to Row 5, Bill Flemming fills all roles; however, there are no prior consecutive years with Chris Economaki as a pit reporter.\n\n4. **Check for Three Consecutive Years:**\n   - To satisfy the claim, we need three consecutive rows where:\n     - Bill Fleming is lap-by-lap announcer and host.\n     - Chris Economaki is one of the pit reporters.\n   - The only series of years that come close are 1963 to 1965. However, in 1964, there is an additional person (Stirling Moss) as a pit reporter alongside Chris Economaki.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - There are no three consecutive years where Bill Fleming and Chris Economaki form the announce duo with the specified roles without any deviation.\n   - Therefore, the claim does not hold true based on the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The task is to find if there are three consecutive years where Bill Flemming serves as both lap-by-lap announcer and host while Chris Economaki is a pit reporter.
