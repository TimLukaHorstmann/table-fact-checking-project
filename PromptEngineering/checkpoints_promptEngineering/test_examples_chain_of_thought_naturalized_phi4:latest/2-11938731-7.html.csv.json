    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the Pittsburgh Gladiator players scoring more than one touchdown in the 1987 season is true or false, we need to examine each player's recorded touchdowns from the table provided.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that \"all the players on the Pittsburgh Gladiator scored more than 1 touchdown in the 1987 season.\"\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**: We need to look at the 'td 's' (touchdowns) column for each player in the table.\n\n3. **Examine Each Player's Touchdown Record**:\n   - Row 1: Joel Gueli, touchdowns = 1\n   - Row 2: Craig Walls, touchdowns = 0\n   - Row 3: Russell Hairston, touchdowns = 1\n   - Row 4: Creig Federico, touchdowns = 0\n   - Row 5: Scott Dmitrenko, touchdowns = 0\n   - Row 6: Mike Stoops, touchdowns = 0\n   - Row 7: John McClennon, touchdowns = 0\n   - Row 8: Ricky Mitchell, touchdowns = 0\n   - Row 9: Jim Rafferty, touchdowns = 0\n   - Row 10: Thomas Weaver, touchdowns = 0\n   - Row 11: Earnest Adams, touchdowns = 0\n   - Row 12: Mike Powell, touchdowns = 0\n   - Row 13: Greg Best, touchdowns = 0\n   - Row 14: Willis Yates, touchdowns = 0\n   - Row 15: Lee Larsen, touchdowns = 0\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**: \n   - The claim requires all players to have more than one touchdown (i.e., at least 2).\n   - From the examination above, no player has more than 1 touchdown.\n   - In fact, only Joel Gueli and Russell Hairston scored exactly 1 touchdown each, while all other players scored 0 touchdowns.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since not a single player scored more than one touchdown, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that all Pittsburgh Gladiator players scored more than 1 touchdown in the 1987 season.
