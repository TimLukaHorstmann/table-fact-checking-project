    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the bore sizes for all entries in the table and specifically check if the 9 adr (Row 3) has a bore size that matches every other entry.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that \"9 adr have a bore of mm (in) just like every other bore in the table.\" This means all entries, including 9 adr, should share the same bore size value.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Data**:\n   - We need to check the 'bore' column for each row.\n   - The table format indicates that specific values are not provided here; we will assume they are placeholders and focus on consistency across rows.\n\n3. **Analyze Each Row**:\n   - Rows 1 through 12 all have a bore entry listed as \"mm (in)\" without specific numerical values.\n   - This implies the bore sizes for each engine type are expressed in the same format but does not specify actual measurements.\n\n4. **Consistency Check**:\n   - Since every row lists \"mm (in)\" for the bore size, this indicates uniformity in how bore size is recorded across all entries.\n   - The claim focuses on the bore size being represented similarly (\"just like every other bore\"), which holds true because each entry uses the same format.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since all entries use \"mm (in)\" for the bore column, including 9 adr, they indeed have a bore size expressed in the same manner.\n   - Therefore, the claim is TRUE based on the provided information and the assumption that the lack of specific numerical values indicates uniformity.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim states that 9 adr has a bore size 'just like every other bore in the table.'\",\n    \"We need to check if all entries, including 9 adr, have the same format for bore size.\",\n    \"Each row lists the bore as 'mm (in)', indicating uniformity in representation across all entries.\",\n    \"Since 9 adr and all other rows use the same format for bore size, the claim is true.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"bore\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"bore\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"bore\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bore\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"bore\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"bore\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"bore\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"bore\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"bore\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"bore\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"bore\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"bore\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
