This is a repetition of the same number of wins.\n\n4. **Evaluate the claim**: The claim states that the Dundee Hurricane \"do not win the same number of game[s] in any of the season they play between 2003 and 2009.\" We found two instances (2003 and 2004) where the team won the same number of games, which contradicts this statement.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The claim is false because there are seasons with identical win totals within the given range.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- **Row 1, Column: wins** (6 wins for 2003)\n- **Row 2, Column: wins** (6 wins for 2004)\n- **Other relevant rows for completeness**:\n  - Row 3, Column: wins\n  - Row 4, Column: wins\n  - Row 5, Column: wins\n  - Row 6, Column: wins\n  - Row 7, Column: wins\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We examined the 'wins' column for each season from 2003 to 2009.
