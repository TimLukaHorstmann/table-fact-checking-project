Therefore, we need to look for drivers who finished exactly 72 laps.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - We will go through each row in the table and check the \"laps\" column to see how many laps each driver completed.\n\n3. **Count Drivers Who Completed 72 Laps**:\n   - Row 1: Mika H\u00e4kkinen, 72 laps\n   - Row 2: David Coulthard, 72 laps\n   - Row 3: Michael Schumacher, 72 laps\n   - Row 4: Alexander Wurz, 72 laps\n   - Rows 5-22: All these drivers completed fewer than 72 laps.\n\n4. **Total Drivers Completing 72 Laps**:\n   - From the analysis above, we find that four drivers completed all 72 laps: Mika H\u00e4kkinen, David Coulthard, Michael Schumacher, and Alexander Wurz.\n\n5. **Verify Against the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that \"only 4 driver[s] complete all 72 lap of the race.\" Our analysis confirms this is true as exactly four drivers completed 72 laps.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is accurate based on the data provided in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the total number of laps to be completed (72).
