    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Peter Schaefer played in more playoff games than Brent Sopel did\" is true or false, we need to compare their respective numbers of playoff games (pl gp) from the provided table.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Players and Columns:**\n   - We are interested in the players \"Peter Schaefer\" and \"Brent Sopel.\"\n   - The relevant column for this comparison is \"pl gp,\" which stands for playoff games played.\n\n2. **Locate Peter Schaefer's Data:**\n   - In Row 3, we find Peter Schaefer with:\n     - pl gp = 3\n   - This indicates Peter Schaefer played in 3 playoff games.\n\n3. **Locate Brent Sopel's Data:**\n   - In Row 6, we find Brent Sopel with:\n     - pl gp = 42\n   - This indicates Brent Sopel played in 42 playoff games.\n\n4. **Compare Playoff Games Played:**\n   - Peter Schaefer played 3 playoff games.\n   - Brent Sopel played 42 playoff games.\n   - Clearly, 3 (Peter Schaefer) is less than 42 (Brent Sopel).\n\n5. **Determine the Truth of the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Peter Schaefer played in more playoff games than Brent Sopel did.\n   - Since 3 is not greater than 42, the claim is false.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim, we compare the 'pl gp' values for Peter Schaefer and Brent Sopel.
