    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, we need to break it down into its components:\n\n1. **Chris Mills being the tallest player**: \n   - According to the table:\n     - Alonzo Mourning: 6'10\"\n     - Chris Jackson: 6'0\"\n     - Chris Mills: 6'7\"\n     - Billy Owens: 6'9\"\n     - Kenny Williams: 6'10\"\n\n   From this information, we see that both Alonzo Mourning and Kenny Williams are the tallest players at 6'10\". Therefore, the statement \"Chris Mills be the tallest player\" is FALSE.\n\n2. **Billy Owens being the shortest player**:\n   - The heights listed in the table show Chris Jackson as the shortest at 6'0\".\n   \n   Thus, Billy Owens is not the shortest player.
