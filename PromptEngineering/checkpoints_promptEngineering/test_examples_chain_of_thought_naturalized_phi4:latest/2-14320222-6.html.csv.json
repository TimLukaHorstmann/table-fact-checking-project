Therefore, it is impossible for three different games (including game 61) to sum up to exactly 86 points.\n\n3. **Verify Points for All Other Games:**\n   - Review the points column for all rows:\n     - Row 1: 72\n     - Row 2: 74\n     - Row 3: 75\n     - Row 4: 76\n     - Row 5: 78\n     - Row 6: 80\n     - Row 7: 80\n     - Row 8: 82\n     - Row 9: 84\n     - Row 10 (game 61): 86\n     - Row 11: 86\n     - Row 12: 86\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since game 61 alone already has 86 points, it is impossible for any combination of three games to total exactly 86 points.\n   - Therefore, the claim that \"game 61 be 1 of 3 game that total 86 point\" is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Game 61 has 86 points by itself.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the total points for Buffalo Sabres and Los Angeles Kings, we will follow a step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Games**:  \n   We need to find the games involving the Buffalo Sabres and the Los Angeles Kings from the table.\n\n2. **Find Points After Each Game**:\n   - For the Buffalo Sabres: \n     - Locate Row 5 in the table, where the opponent is \"buffalo sabres\". The points after this game are 78.\n   - For the Los Angeles Kings:\n     - Locate Row 9 in the table, where the opponent is \"los angeles kings\". The points after this game are 84.\n\n3. **Calculate Points Before Each Game**:\n   - For the Buffalo Sabres:\n     - Look at the previous row (Row 4) to find the points before their game. The points were 76.\n   - For the Los Angeles Kings:\n     - Look at the previous row (Row 8) to find the points before their game. The points were 82.\n\n4. **Determine Points Earned in Each Game**:\n   - For the Buffalo Sabres:\n     - Points after the game: 78\n     - Points before the game: 76\n     - Points earned = 78 - 76 = 2 points\n   - For the Los Angeles Kings:\n     - Points after the game: 84\n     - Points before the game: 82\n     - Points earned = 84 - 82 = 2 points\n\n5. **Verify Total Points**:\n   - Sum of points earned in both games: 2 (Buffalo Sabres) + 2 (Los Angeles Kings) = 4 points.\n   - The claim states that the total is 80, which seems to refer to the combined points after each respective game rather than the sum of points earned.\n\n6. **Check Combined Points After Each Game**:\n   - Buffalo Sabres: 78 points\n   - Los Angeles Kings: 84 points\n   - Total = 78 + 84 = 162 points\n\n7. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the total is \"80\", which does not match the combined total of 162 points after both games.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant games involving Buffalo Sabres and Los Angeles Kings.\",\n    \"Find points after each game: Buffalo Sabres (78) and Los Angeles Kings (84).\",\n    \"Calculate points before each game: Buffalo Sabres (76) and Los Angeles Kings (82).\",\n    \"Determine points earned in each game: 2 points for both teams.\",\n    \"Verify total points earned from both games: 4 points.\",\n    \"Check combined points after each game: Total is 162 points.\",\n    \"Evaluate the claim: The claim states a total of 80, which is incorrect.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
