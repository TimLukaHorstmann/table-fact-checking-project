Among these, only row 10 has David Ferrer as the opponent. Therefore, this part of the claim is false because not every match he lost on a hard surface was against David Ferrer.\n\n2. **Claim Part 2**: \"He lose to John Isner each time they play on a carpeted surface.\"\n\n   - The table does not mention any matches played on a carpeted surface.\n   - Therefore, this part of the claim is vacuously true because there are no instances of playing against John Isner on a carpeted surface.\n\nSince the first part of the claim is false, the entire claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify all matches where Olivier Rochus lost and check if they were played on a hard surface.\",\n    \"Rows with outcome 'runner-up' and surface 'hard' are: 2 (Lars Burgsm\u00fcller), 3 (Karol Ku\u010dera), 4 (Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez), 6 (Richard Gasquet), 10 (David Ferrer).\",\n    \"Only in row 10 is David Ferrer the opponent, so the first part of the claim is false.\",\n    \"The table does not mention any matches on a carpeted surface, making the second part vacuously true.\",\n    \"Since the first part is false, the entire claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
