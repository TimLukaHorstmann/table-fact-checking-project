Boo Weekley is indeed listed in a row with a place of t10 and has a score of 211.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 13:\n  - Place: \"t10\"\n  - Player: \"boo weekley\"\n  - Score: \"67 + 72 + 72 = 211\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states Boo Weekley is in t10 place with a score of 211.
