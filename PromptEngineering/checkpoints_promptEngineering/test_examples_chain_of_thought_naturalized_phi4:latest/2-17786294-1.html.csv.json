    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to evaluate both components: \n\n1. **The highest scoring leg for a match**.\n2. **The highest aggregate score total of 8 goals**, specifically between FC Nantes vs Besan\u00e7on RC.\n\nLet's break down each component:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n#### Highest Scoring Leg\nA \"leg\" refers to one half of the overall match, meaning either the first or second round (or leg) in this context. We need to find the highest number of goals scored in any single leg across all matches.\n\n- **Row 1:** First round - 1 goal each; Second round - 0 goals each.\n- **Row 2:** First round - 1 goal; Second round - 3 goals.\n- **Row 3:** First round - 2 goals; Second round - 4 goals.\n- **Row 4:** First round - 1 goal; Second round - 2 goals.\n- **Row 5:** First round - 0 goals; Second round - 4 goals.\n- **Row 6:** First round - 3 goals; Second round - 1 goal.\n- **Row 7:** First round - 2 goals; Second round - 1 goal.\n- **Row 8:** First round - 4 goals; Second round - 1 goal.\n\nThe highest scoring leg is from Row 3 (AS Monaco vs AS Nancy) with 4 goals in the second round. \n\n#### Highest Aggregate Score\nAggregate score refers to the total number of goals scored by both teams across both rounds for a match. We need to determine which match had the highest aggregate score and check if it totals 8 goals, specifically for FC Nantes vs Besan\u00e7on RC.\n\n- **Row 1:** Total = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 2 goals.\n- **Row 2:** Total = 1 + 4 + 1 + 3 = 9 goals.\n- **Row 3:** Total = 2 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 8 goals.\n- **Row 4:** Total = 0 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 goals.\n- **Row 5:** Total = 0 + 0 + 4 + 4 = 8 goals.\n- **Row 6:** Total = 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 goals.\n- **Row 7:** Total = 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 3 goals.\n- **Row 8:** Total = 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 6 goals.\n\nThe matches with the highest aggregate score of 9 goals are Row 2 (FC Rouen vs Stade Lavallois). FC Nantes vs Besan\u00e7on RC (which doesn't exist in the table) is not involved here. Additionally, there are two matches with an aggregate of 8 goals: Row 3 and Row 5.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The highest scoring leg was 4 goals in Row 3.\n- The highest aggregate score was 9 goals in Row 2.\n- FC Nantes vs Besan\u00e7on RC is not listed; hence, they do not have an aggregate of 8 goals or any other value.\n\nThus, the claim that \"the highest scoring leg and highest aggregate score for a match total 8 goals with FC Nantes vs Besan\u00e7on RC\" is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The highest scoring leg was 4 goals in Row 3 (AS Monaco vs AS Nancy).
