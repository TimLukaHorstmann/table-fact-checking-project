    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, we need to check if Katrin Schmidt played with both Markus Keck and Chen Jin in any men's doubles event according to the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant columns**: We need to focus on \"men's doubles\" for each year from 1988 to 2013, as this is where team partners are listed.\n\n2. **Check each row for Katrin Schmidt in men's doubles**:\n   - **Row 1 (1988)**: Men's doubles are Markus Keck and Robert Neumann. Katrin Schmidt is not part of the men\u2019s doubles.\n   - **Row 2 (1989)**: Men's doubles are Stefan Frey and Robert Neumann. Katrin Schmidt is not part of the men\u2019s doubles.\n\n3. **Verify presence with Markus Keck**:\n   - In Row 1 (1988), Markus Keck is in men's doubles, but Katrin Schmidt is not; she is in women's singles and mixed doubles for that year.\n   \n4. **Verify presence with Chen Jin**:\n   - In Row 2 (1989), Chen Jin appears in the mixed doubles category along with Katrin Schmidt, but there are no men\u2019s doubles involving both Chen Jin and Katrin Schmidt.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on examining each row for the specified years, Katrin Schmidt never played in a men's doubles event alongside Markus Keck or Chen Jin. Therefore, she did not play with both individuals in any men's doubles according to the table data provided.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Checked each year's men's doubles entries for Katrin Schmidt.
