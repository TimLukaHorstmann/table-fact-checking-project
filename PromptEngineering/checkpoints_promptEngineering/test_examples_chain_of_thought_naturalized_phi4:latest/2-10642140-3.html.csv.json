    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, let's analyze it step-by-step using the information provided in the table:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Claim\n\nThe claim states:\n- \"More than 4 countries tie for 10th place.\"\n- \"Each win a bronze medal.\"\n\nWe need to verify both parts of this statement.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Countries Tied for 10th Place\n\nFrom the table, look at rows 10 through 13:\n\n- Row 10: Burkina Faso (rank = 10, total medals = 1)\n- Row 11: Ivory Coast (rank = 10, total medals = 1)\n- Row 12: Gabon (rank = 10, total medals = 1)\n- Row 13: Madagascar (rank = 10, total medals = 1)\n\nThere are four countries tied for the 10th place. This satisfies \"more than 4\" as it is exactly 4.\n\n### Step 3: Verify Each Wins a Bronze Medal\n\nCheck if each of these countries won exactly one bronze medal:\n\n- Row 10: Burkina Faso (bronze = 1)\n- Row 11: Ivory Coast (bronze = 1)\n- Row 12: Gabon (bronze = 1)\n- Row 13: Madagascar (bronze = 1)\n\nEach of these countries has exactly one bronze medal.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nThe claim is that \"more than 4 countries tie for 10th place,\" which is not correct because only 4 countries are tied. However, the second part, \"each win a bronze medal,\" is true for the four countries mentioned.\n\nSince the first part of the claim (\"more than 4 countries\") is false, the entire claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are from rows 10 to 13, specifically focusing on rank, nation, and bronze columns:\n\n- Row 10: {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}, {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"nation\"}, {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n- Row 11: {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}, {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"nation\"}, {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n- Row 12: {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}, {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"nation\"}, {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n- Row 13: {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}, {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"nation\"}, {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states more than 4 countries tie for 10th place and each wins a bronze medal.
