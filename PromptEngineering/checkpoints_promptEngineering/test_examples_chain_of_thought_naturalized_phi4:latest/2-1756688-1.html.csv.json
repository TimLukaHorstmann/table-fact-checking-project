This indicates that Nathan Ablett scored a total of 4 goals in the 2006 season.\n\n4. **Compare Goals Between Seasons:**\n   - For 2005, Nathan Ablett scored 8 goals.\n   - For 2006, he scored 4 goals.\n   - Comparing these numbers, 8 (in 2005) is greater than 4 (in 2006).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Nathan Ablett scored more goals in 2005 than in 2006, the claim \"Nathan Ablett scored more goals in 2006 than he did in 2005\" is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- For the 2005 season (Row 1), the relevant cell is:\n  - `row_index`: 1, `column_name`: \"goals\"\n\n- For the 2006 season (Row 2), the relevant cell is:\n  - `row_index`: 2, `column_name`: \"goals\"\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Nathan Ablett scored more goals in 2006 than in 2005.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Nathan Ablett's best year for points while playing for Geelong was 2008, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: First, identify which rows of the table pertain to Nathan Ablett's time with the Geelong team. The relevant rows are those labeled as seasons: 2005, 2006, 2007, and a row with no data for 2008 (Row 4).\n\n2. **Calculate Points per Year**: Points in Australian Rules Football can be calculated using goals and behinds where each goal is worth 6 points and each behind is worth 1 point.\n\n3. **Perform Calculations**:\n   - For the year 2005:  \n     - Goals = 8, Behind = 2  \n     - Total points = (8 * 6) + (2 * 1) = 48 + 2 = 50\n   - For the year 2006:  \n     - Goals = 4, Behind = 3  \n     - Total points = (4 * 6) + (3 * 1) = 24 + 3 = 27\n   - For the year 2007:  \n     - Goals = 34, Behind = 18  \n     - Total points = (34 * 6) + (18 * 1) = 204 + 18 = 222\n\n4. **Assess Data for 2008**: Row 4 does not provide any data for the year 2008 (indicated by dashes), so we cannot calculate any points for that year.\n\n5. **Compare Calculations**: From our calculations:\n   - 2005: 50 points\n   - 2006: 27 points\n   - 2007: 222 points\n   - 2008: No data available\n\n6. **Determine Best Year**: Based on the calculated points, Nathan Ablett's best year for points with Geelong was 2007 with a total of 222 points.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The claim that his best year for points while playing for Geelong was in 2008 is false because there is no data available for 2008 and 2007 had the highest recorded points during his tenure at Geelong.\n\nGiven this analysis, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant seasons: 2005, 2006, 2007 with Geelong.\",\n    \"Calculate points for each year using goals and behinds (goal = 6 points, behind = 1 point).\",\n    \"For 2005: Points = (8 * 6) + (2 * 1) = 50.\",\n    \"For 2006: Points = (4 * 6) + (3 * 1) = 27.\",\n    \"For 2007: Points = (34 * 6) + (18 * 1) = 222.\",\n    \"Row for 2008 has no data, so no points can be calculated.\",\n    \"Compare the points: 50 (2005), 27 (2006), 222 (2007).\",\n    \"Conclude that the best year was 2007 with 222 points.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
