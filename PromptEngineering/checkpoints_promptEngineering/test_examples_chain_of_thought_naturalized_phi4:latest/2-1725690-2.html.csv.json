    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"more pitchers have won the award than players in any other position\" is true, we need to analyze the table and count how many times each position appears. We will specifically focus on counting the occurrences of the \"pitcher\" position and compare it with other positions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Unique Positions**: \n   - From the table, extract all unique positions: Outfielder, Third Baseman, First Baseman, Designated Hitter, Shortstop, Second Baseman, Catcher, Pitcher.\n\n2. **Count Occurrences of Each Position**:\n   - Go through each row and tally how many times each position appears.\n\n3. **Tally Counts**:\n   - Outfielder: 7 occurrences (1971, 1973, 1975, 1978, 1986, 1988, 1996, 1998, 1999)\n   - Third Baseman: 2 occurrences (1972, 1976)\n   - First Baseman: 4 occurrences (1979, 1981, 2002, 2006)\n   - Designated Hitter: 3 occurrences (1982, 1984, 1994)\n   - Shortstop: 3 occurrences (1992, 1993, 1995, 2009)\n   - Second Baseman: 2 occurrences (1991, 2007)\n   - Catcher: 1 occurrence (1989)\n   - Pitcher: 6 occurrences (1980, 1987, 1990, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2010)\n\n4. **Compare Counts**:\n   - Compare the count of pitchers with each other position.\n   - Outfielders have the highest count with 9 occurrences.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since outfielders (9) have more appearances than pitchers (8), the claim that \"more pitchers have won the award than players in any other position\" is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells are those corresponding to each row where a position is listed.
