Check if this entry has a release price of 70.\n\nHere's how I would systematically approach this:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Specific Criteria**:\n   - We need to look for entries where the `release date` is \"2008 q3\" and the `part number (s)` includes \"nu80579ez009c\".\n\n2. **Check Each Row in the Table**:\n   - **Row 1**: This row is a header or introductory row indicating what attributes do not have \"quickassist\". It does not provide any specific data about release dates or part numbers.\n   - **Row 2**: The `release date` is \"2008 q3\", but the `part number (s)` is \"nu80579ez600cnu80579ez600ct\". This does not match our target part number.\n   - **Row 3**: The `release date` is \"2008 q3\" and the `part number (s)` is \"nu80579ez004c\". Again, this doesn't match our target part number.\n   - **Row 4**: Here, the `release date` is \"2008 q3\" and the `part number (s)` is \"nu80579ez009c\". This matches both criteria. We also see that the `release price ( usd )` for this row is 70, which aligns with the claim.\n   - **Row 5**: This row is another header or introductory entry with all attributes labeled as \"with quickassist\", so it does not contain specific data.\n   - **Row 6 to Row 8**: In these rows, either the `release date` or the `part number (s)` do not match our required criteria. Specifically:\n     - Row 6: The part number is \"nu80579eb600c\".\n     - Row 7: The part number includes \"nu80579ed004c\".\n     - Row 8: The part number is \"nu80579ed009c\".\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Only **Row 4** satisfies the condition where both the `release date` is \"2008 q3\" and the `part number (s)` includes \"nu80579ez009c\".
