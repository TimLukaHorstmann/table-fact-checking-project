However, the table does not explicitly mention the year. Assuming the table represents a complete season in chronological order (weeks 1 through 14), we will focus on whether it ends with a win at the Miami Orange Bowl.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant rows of the table:\n\n- **Row 14:** \n  - \"Week\": 14\n  - \"Date\": December 20\n  - \"Opponent\": Miami Dolphins\n  - \"Result\": l 13 - 14 (loss)\n  - \"Game Site\": Miami Orange Bowl\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude the following:\n\n- The game at the Miami Orange Bowl was a loss for the Denver Broncos (Row 14).\n- This game is indeed the last one of the season as it is Week 14.\n- Since the result is a loss, the claim that they finished with a win is false.\n\nThus, based on the analysis, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows that in week 14, the Denver Broncos played at the Miami Orange Bowl and lost to the Miami Dolphins.
