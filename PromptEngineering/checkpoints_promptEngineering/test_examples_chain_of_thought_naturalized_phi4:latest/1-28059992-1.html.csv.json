    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Jason Clemett be pick after the player Mark Farraway\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the Row for Jason Clemett:**\n   - Look through each row to find where Jason Clemett is listed as a player.\n   - According to Row 7, Jason Clemett is associated with pick number 7 and played for the Calgary team.\n\n2. **Identify the Row for Mark Farraway:**\n   - Similarly, locate the row where Mark Farraway is mentioned.\n   - From Row 8, we see that Mark Farraway is linked to pick number 8 and played for the Edmonton team.\n\n3. **Compare Pick Numbers:**\n   - Jason Clemett's pick number is 7.\n   - Mark Farraway's pick number is 8.\n   - Since pick numbers are in ascending order, a lower number means that player was selected earlier.\n\n4. **Determine the Order of Selections:**\n   - Jason Clemett (pick 7) was selected before Mark Farraway (pick 8).\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"Jason Clemett be pick after the player Mark Farraway.\"\n   - Based on our analysis, this is false because Jason Clemett was picked before Mark Farraway.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The claim is FALSE since Jason Clemett was selected with a lower pick number (7) compared to Mark Farraway's pick number (8).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the rows for Jason Clemett and Mark Farraway.
