Check the condition for each race:\n- For a race to satisfy the claim, both the world cup leader's team and the winner's team must be Quick Step - Davitamon.\n\n#### Verification:\n\n- **Z\u00fcri-Metzgete** (Row 8):\n  - World Cup Leader's Team: Quick Step - Davitamon\n  - Winner's Team: Team Telekom (not Quick Step - Davitamon)\n\n- **Paris-Tours** (Row 9):\n  - World Cup Leader's Team: Quick Step - Davitamon\n  - Winner's Team: Team Telekom (not Quick Step - Davitamon)\n\n#### Conclusion:\nNeither Z\u00fcri-Metzgete nor Paris-Tours has both the world cup leader's team and the winner's team as Quick Step - Davitamon. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 8, \"world cup leader 's team\": Quick Step - Davitamon\n- Row 8, \"team\": Team Telekom (Winner)\n- Row 9, \"world cup leader 's team\": Quick Step - Davitamon\n- Row 9, \"team\": Team Telekom (Winner)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires both the world cup leader's team and the winner's team to be Quick Step - Davitamon for the races Z\u00fcri-Metzgete and Paris-Tours.
