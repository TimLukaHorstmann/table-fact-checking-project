Each row represents a fight, with the result indicated by \"res\" (result) and the opponent's name given directly after it.\n\n2. **Count Losses:**\n   - A loss is identified when \"res\" contains \"x loss\" or \"loss\".\n   - We need to count all such entries to determine how many fighters he has lost to.\n\n3. **Check Specific Opponent:**\n   - After counting the total losses, check if \"Tommy Depret\" appears as an opponent in any of these loss records.\n\n4. **Verify Total Losses:** Ensure that the total number of losses is indeed 14 as claimed.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Row-by-row Check for Losses:**\n  - Row 17: `res` is \"x loss\", opponent is \"phil norman\".\n  - Row 20: `res` is \"x loss\", opponent is \"shiko yamashita\".\n  - Row 24: `res` is \"x loss\", opponent is \"ryuta sakurai\".\n  - Row 6: `res` is \"loss\", opponent is \"tommy depret\".\n\n- **Count of Losses:** \n  - Total losses found are 4 (phil norman, shiko yamashita, ryuta sakurai, and tommy depret).\n\n- **Verification of Tommy Depret as an Opponent:**\n  - Row 6 confirms that Tommy Depret is indeed one of the fighters David Bielkheden has lost to.\n\n- **Total Losses Verification:**\n  - The total number of losses is 4, not 14. Therefore, the claim about the number of fighters he has lost to (14) is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that Tommy Depret is one of the 14 fighters David Bielkheden has lost to is false because he has only lost to 4 fighters in total.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify all rows where 'res' indicates a loss.
