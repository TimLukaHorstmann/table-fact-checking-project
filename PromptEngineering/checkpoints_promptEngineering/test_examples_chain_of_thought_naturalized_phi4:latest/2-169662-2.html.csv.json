    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Wes Albritton be 1 of 7 people who have tko win\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table for fights where the method of victory was a Technical Knockout (TKO).\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify TKO Wins**: We must first identify all rows in the table where the \"method\" column indicates a TKO win.\n\n2. **Review Each Row**:\n   - Row 2: Opponent is Ken Shamrock, Method is TKO (corner stoppage).\n   - Row 3: Opponent is Vladimir Matyushenko, Method is Decision (unanimous) \u2013 Not a TKO.\n   - Row 4: Opponent is Elvis Sinosic, Method is TKO (punches & elbows).\n   - Row 5: Opponent is Evan Tanner, Method is KO (slam) \u2013 Not a TKO.\n   - Row 6: Opponent is Yuki Kondo, Method is Submission (cobra choke) \u2013 Not a TKO.\n   - Row 7: Opponent is Wanderlei Silva, Method is Decision (unanimous) \u2013 Not a TKO.\n   - Row 9: Opponent is Guy Mezger, Method is TKO (punches).\n   - Row 10: Opponent is Jerry Bohlander, Method is TKO (cut).\n   - Row 18: Opponent is Wes Albritton, Method is TKO (punches).\n\n3. **Count TKO Wins**: From the above review, we have identified the following rows as TKO wins:\n   - Row 2: Ken Shamrock\n   - Row 4: Elvis Sinosic\n   - Row 9: Guy Mezger\n   - Row 10: Jerry Bohlander\n   - Row 18: Wes Albritton\n\n4. **Verify the Claim**: The claim states that Wes Albritton is one of 7 people who have TKO wins. We identified only 5 distinct opponents (Ken Shamrock, Elvis Sinosic, Guy Mezger, Jerry Bohlander, and Wes Albritton) associated with TKO victories in this fighter's record.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that \"Wes Albritton be 1 of 7 people who have tko win\" is false because there are only 5 distinct opponents who were defeated by TKO according to the table data provided, not 7.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified rows where 'method' was a TKO.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"there be only 1 person who have have zero loss so far\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data to identify fighters with a record of zero losses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Structure**: The table records fight outcomes (results) for one fighter against various opponents. Each row represents a single fight and includes:\n   - Result (`res`)\n   - Record (`record`): format \"wins-losses-draws\"\n   - Opponent, method, event, round, time, location.\n\n2. **Identify Rows with Zero Losses**: \n   - We need to look for rows where the `losses` component of the `record` is zero.\n   - This indicates that up to that point in their career (as per the table), the fighter has not lost any fights.\n\n3. **Examine Each Record**:\n   - Row 28: `\"1 - 0, ...\"` indicates 1 win and 0 losses.\n   - Rows with no loss until they are defeated:\n     - Row 24: `\"4 - 1, ...\"`, 4 wins, 1 loss.\n     - Row 25: `\"3 - 1, ...\"`, 3 wins, 1 loss.\n     - Row 26: `\"2 - 1, ...\"`, 2 wins, 1 loss.\n     - Row 27: `\"1 - 1, ...\"` , 1 win, 1 loss.\n\n4. **Check for Zero Loss Records**:\n   - Only Row 28 has a record of zero losses (`\"1 - 0\"`).\n\n5. **Verify Uniqueness**:\n   - There is only one row (Row 28) with a record indicating zero losses.\n   - This means there is indeed only one person in the table who has had zero losses up to that point.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis, the claim \"there be only 1 person who have have zero loss so far\" is true. The relevant cell for this conclusion is Row 28, which shows a record of `\"1 - 0\"` (1 win and 0 losses).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table records one fighter's results against various opponents.
