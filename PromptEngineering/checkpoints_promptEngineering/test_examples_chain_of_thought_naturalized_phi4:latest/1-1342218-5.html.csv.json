This could be considered a typographical error.\n\n3. **Party Affiliation**:\n   - The claim mentions \"(D)\" which stands for Democratic.\n   - In Row 2, the party is listed as \"(d) unopposed\", confirming it is indeed Democratic.\n\n4. **Unopposed Status**:\n   - The claim states \"unopposed\".\n   - In Row 2, it is confirmed that the candidate was \"unopposed\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The name discrepancy (\"Mill\" vs. \"Mills\") is minor and likely a typographical error.\n- All other aspects of the claim (district, party affiliation, unopposed status) match the data in the table.\n\nGiven these observations, the claim can be considered TRUE despite the slight naming inconsistency.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim specifies district Arkansas 2, candidate Wilbur Mill (D) unopposed.

This appears to be a minor typographical error in the claim (missing 's' in Mills), but we can reasonably assume it refers to Wilbur Mills.\n\n4. **Verify Result**:\n   - In Row 2, under the column \"result\", it lists \"re-elected\".\n   - The claim states the result should be \"re-elected\".
