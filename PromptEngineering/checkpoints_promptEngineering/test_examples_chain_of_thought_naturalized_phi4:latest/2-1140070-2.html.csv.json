    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"mclaren - tag be the constructor of the car for the race where nigel mansell run the fastest lap\" is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Races with Nigel Mansell's Fastest Lap:**\n   - We look through each row in the table under the \"fastest lap\" column to find any instance where Nigel Mansell ran the fastest lap.\n\n2. **Check Constructor for These Races:**\n   - For each race identified in step 1, we need to check the \"constructor\" column to see if it is \"mclaren - tag\".\n\n3. **Verify Claim:**\n   - If there exists at least one instance where Nigel Mansell's fastest lap corresponds with a constructor of \"mclaren - tag\", then the claim is true.\n   - Otherwise, the claim is false.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- **Row 1:** Fastest Lap = Alain Prost\n- **Row 2:** Fastest Lap = Ayrton Senna\n- **Row 3:** Fastest Lap = Michele Alboreto\n- **Row 4:** Fastest Lap = Michele Alboreto\n- **Row 5:** Fastest Lap = Ayrton Senna\n- **Row 6:** Fastest Lap = Ayrton Senna\n- **Row 7:** Fastest Lap = Keke Rosberg\n- **Row 8:** Fastest Lap = Alain Prost\n- **Row 9:** Fastest Lap = Niki Lauda\n- **Row 10:** Fastest Lap = Alain Prost\n- **Row 11:** Fastest Lap = Alain Prost\n- **Row 12:** Fastest Lap = Nigel Mansell (Constructor: Mclaren - Tag)\n- **Row 13:** Fastest Lap = Alain Prost\n- **Row 14:** Fastest Lap = Jacques Laffite\n- **Row 15:** Fastest Lap = Keke Rosberg\n- **Row 16:** Fastest Lap = Keke Rosberg\n\nFrom the above, Nigel Mansell ran the fastest lap in Row 12 (Italian Grand Prix).
