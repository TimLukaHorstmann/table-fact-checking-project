    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim \"the indianapolis colt defeat the bucs 2 time in 1985,\" we need to analyze the table for all games involving the Indianapolis Colts in 1985.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify relevant rows:**\n   - We are interested in finding entries where the opponent is the \"Indianapolis Colts.\"\n   \n2. **Review each row for 'opponent':**\n   - Row 1 (Header) describes the columns and does not contain game data.\n   - Rows 2-17 detail individual games, focusing on specific opponents.\n\n3. **Locate games against the Indianapolis Colts:**\n   - Check each row to see if \"Indianapolis Colts\" appears in the 'opponent' column.\n\n4. **Examine results for identified games:**\n   - Row 15 mentions an opponent as \"Indianapolis colts.\"\n   - The result of this game is listed as \"l 31 - 23,\" indicating a loss for the Buccaneers (Bucs).\n\n5. **Count victories against Indianapolis Colts:**\n   - Based on the result in Row 15, there are no wins against the Colts; there is only one recorded game and it was a loss.\n\n6. **Conclusion about the claim:**\n   - The claim states that the Buccaneers defeated the Colts twice.
