South Melbourne has a home team score of 13.13 (91).\n2. This score is the lowest among all home teams listed in the table.\n\n### Step 2: Verify South Melbourne's Home Team Score\n- **Row 1**: The data for Row 1 indicates that South Melbourne is indeed the home team with a score of \"10.13 (73).\"\n  \nThis immediately contradicts part of the claim since it states that their score should be \"13.13 (91)\" when it is actually \"10.13 (73).\" Hence, the first part of the claim is false.\n\n### Step 3: Check for the Lowest Home Team Score\n- **Row 1**: South Melbourne - Home team score: 10.13 (73)\n- **Row 2**: Richmond - Home team score: 13.10 (88)\n- **Row 3**: Fitzroy - Home team score: 19.11 (125)\n- **Row 4**: Footscray - Home team score: 12.11 (83)\n- **Row 5**: Carlton - Home team score: 13.13 (91)\n- **Row 6**: North Melbourne - Home team score: 17.11 (113)\n\nFrom this, we can see that the lowest home team score is indeed \"10.13 (73)\" by South Melbourne.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim is false for two reasons:\n1. The claimed score of South Melbourne (\"13.13 (91)\") does not match their actual score (\"10.13 (73)\").\n2.
