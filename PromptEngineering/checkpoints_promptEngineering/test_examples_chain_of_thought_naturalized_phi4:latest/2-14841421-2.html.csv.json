    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"4 nations be awarded only 1 total medal\" is true or false, we need to examine the data from the table for any nation(s) with a total of exactly one medal.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that four different nations have been awarded exactly one medal in total.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We need to focus on the \"total\" column for each nation since it represents the sum of gold, silver, and bronze medals.\n\n3. **Examine Each Nation's Total Medals:**\n   - **Iran (Row 1):** Total = 15\n   - **South Korea (Row 2):** Total = 3\n   - **Kazakhstan (Row 3):** Total = 6\n   - **Qatar (Row 4):** Total = 5\n   - **China (Row 5):** Total = 6\n   - **Saudi Arabia (Row 6):** Total = 2\n   - **Japan (Row 7):** Total = 3\n   - **Chinese Taipei (Row 8):** Total = 1\n   - **Indonesia (Row 9):** Total = 1\n\n4. **Count Nations with Exactly One Medal:**\n   - From the data, we see that:\n     - Chinese Taipei has a total of 1 medal.\n     - Indonesia also has a total of 1 medal.\n\n5. **Conclusion Based on Data:**\n   - Only two nations (Chinese Taipei and Indonesia) have exactly one total medal each.\n   - The claim states there are four such nations, which is not supported by the data.\n\n6. **Final Determination:**\n   - The claim is false because only two nations meet the criteria of having a total of 1 medal, not four.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Chinese Taipei (Row 8, Total: 1)\n- Indonesia (Row 9, Total: 1)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that four nations have exactly one total medal. By examining the 'total' column for each nation, we find that only Chinese Taipei and Indonesia have a total of 1 medal. Therefore, the claim is false as there are not four such nations.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
