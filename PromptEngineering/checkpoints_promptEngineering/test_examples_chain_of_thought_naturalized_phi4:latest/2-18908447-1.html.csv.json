    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, let's break it down into its components and verify each part against the data in the table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **\"Jim Obradovich pick before round 2\"** - This implies that Jim Obradovich was selected in a round earlier than Round 2.\n2. **\"pick 183\"** - This suggests that Jim Obradovich's pick number is 183.\n3. **\"play tight end position\"** - This indicates that Jim Obradovich plays as a tight end.\n\n### Verification Steps:\n\n1. **Check the round of Jim Obradovich's pick:**\n   - According to Row 4, Jim Obradovich was picked in Round 7.\n   - Since Round 7 is after Round 2, this part of the claim is FALSE.\n\n2. **Check the pick number for Jim Obradovich:**\n   - From Row 4, it's clear that his pick number is 158.\n   - The claim states that he was picked 183rd, which does not match.\n   - Therefore, this part of the claim is also FALSE.\n\n3. **Check the position played by Jim Obradovich:**\n   - According to Row 4, Jim Obradovich plays as a tight end.\n   - This part of the claim matches the table data and is TRUE.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The first two components of the claim are false based on the table data. Even though the third component is true, all parts of the claim must be correct for the entire statement to be true.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check if Jim Obradovich's pick was before Round 2: He was picked in Round 7, which is after Round 2.
