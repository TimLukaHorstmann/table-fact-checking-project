However, all competitions (except the one in 1924) were held at MC G.\n   - Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states an opposite scenario to what is actually presented in the table.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE based on the analysis of the venue information provided in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim suggests that all competitions except for 1924 should have been at Kardinia Park, but the table shows MC G as the venue for all years except 1924.
