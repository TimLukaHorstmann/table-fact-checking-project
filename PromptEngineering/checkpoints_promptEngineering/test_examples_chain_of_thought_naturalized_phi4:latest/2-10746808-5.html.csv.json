    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"a total of 2 team score less than 40 point during the season\" is true or false, we need to evaluate each row's scores for both the home and away teams, and identify how many times a team scored less than 40 points.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the scoring format:** The table uses an Australian rules football score format: (goals).(behinds) (total points). For conversion to total points:\n   - Each goal is worth 6 points.\n   - Each behind is worth 1 point.\n\n2. **Calculate the total points for each team in every row:**\n\n   - **Row 1:** \n     - Melbourne's score: 19.8 (122) = \\(19 \\times 6 + 8 = 122\\)\n     - Richmond's score: 12.17 (89) = \\(12 \\times 6 + 17 = 89\\)\n\n   - **Row 2:**\n     - Essendon's score: 13.7 (85) = \\(13 \\times 6 + 7 = 85\\)\n     - St Kilda's score: 5.8 (38) = \\(5 \\times 6 + 8 = 38\\)\n\n   - **Row 3:**\n     - South Melbourne's score: 10.15 (75) = \\(10 \\times 6 + 15 = 75\\)\n     - North Melbourne's score: 11.7 (73) = \\(11 \\times 6 + 7 = 73\\)\n\n   - **Row 4:**\n     - Hawthorn's score: 9.13 (67) = \\(9 \\times 6 + 13 = 67\\)\n     - Footscray's score: 14.16 (100) = \\(14 \\times 6 + 16 = 100\\)\n\n   - **Row 5:**\n     - Geelong's score: 9.14 (68) = \\(9 \\times 6 + 14 = 68\\)\n     - Collingwood's score: 10.15 (75) = \\(10 \\times 6 + 15 = 75\\)\n\n   - **Row 6:**\n     - Fitzroy's score: 7.16 (58) = \\(7 \\times 6 + 16 = 58\\)\n     - Carlton's score: 7.6 (48) = \\(7 \\times 6 + 6 = 48\\)\n\n3. **Identify teams that scored less than 40 points:**\n\n   From the calculations:\n   - Row 1: Neither team scored less than 40.\n   - Row 2: St Kilda scored 38 points, which is less than 40.\n   - Row 3: No team scored less than 40.\n   - Row 4: No team scored less than 40.\n   - Row 5: No team scored less than 40.\n   - Row 6: No team scored less than 40.\n\n4. **Count the number of instances where a team scored less than 40 points:**\n   - Only St Kilda (Row 2) scored less than 40 points.\n\nSince only one team scored less than 40 points, not two as claimed, the statement is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Each row's scores were converted to total points using the Australian rules football scoring system.
