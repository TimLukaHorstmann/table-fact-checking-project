    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"over 2 years, there be 7 versions of the same song\" is TRUE or FALSE, let's analyze the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the Versions:** We need to count how many distinct versions of the song exist in the table.\n\n   - Row 1: Album version (1995)\n   - Row 2: Single version (1996)\n   - Row 3: Instrumental version (1996)\n   - Row 4: Aches remix (1996)\n   - Row 5: Pain killer mix (1996)\n   - Row 6: Upside down remix (1996)\n   - Row 7: Music video (1996)\n   - Row 8: Live version recorded in 1996\n\n2. **Count the Versions:** We have identified 8 distinct versions of the song from different years.\n\n3. **Check Time Span:** The earliest year mentioned is 1995, and the latest is 1996. The time span between these years is indeed over 1 year (specifically, 1 year).\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:** The claim states \"over 2 years,\" but our analysis shows that the versions span only from 1995 to 1996, which is not over 2 years.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** The claim about the time span is FALSE because it incorrectly states \"over 2 years\" when the actual span is just 1 year. However, there are indeed 7 versions created within this period (ignoring the time span part of the claim).\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant cells for verifying the number of versions and their respective years are:\n\n- Row 1: version, album, remixed by, year\n- Row 2: version, remixed by, year\n- Row 3: version, remixed by, year\n- Row 4: version, remixed by, year\n- Row 5: version, remixed by, year\n- Row 6: version, remixed by, year\n- Row 7: version, album, remixed by, year\n- Row 8: version, album, remixed by, year\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We identified 8 distinct versions of the song from the table.
