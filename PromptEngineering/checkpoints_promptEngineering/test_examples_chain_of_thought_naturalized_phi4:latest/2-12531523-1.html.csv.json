    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Vijay Singh's score being less than 10 under Sandy Lyle's score is true or false, we need to perform a few calculations based on their scores and performances provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Vijay Singh's Score:**\n   - From Row 3, Vijay Singh's total score is 289.\n   - His \"to par\" is +1, meaning he finished 1 stroke over par for the course.\n\n2. **Calculate Sandy Lyle's Par Score:**\n   - From Row 7, Sandy Lyle's total score is 302.\n   - His \"to par\" is +14, indicating he finished 14 strokes over par.\n\n3. **Determine Sandy Lyle's Course Par:**\n   - To find the course par for Sandy Lyle, subtract his \"to par\" from his total score:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Course Par} = \\text{Total Score} - \\text{\"To Par\"} = 302 - 14 = 288\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Vijay Singh's Score Relative to Sandy Lyle's Par:**\n   - Subtract the course par of Sandy Lyle from Vijay Singh's total score:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Difference} = 289 - 288 = +1\n     \\]\n   - This means Vijay Singh's score was 1 stroke over Sandy Lyle's par.\n\n5. **Determine if Vijay Singh's Score is Less Than 10 Under Sandy Lyle's Total:**\n   - Since Vijay Singh's score relative to Sandy Lyle's par is +1, his total score (289) is 13 strokes under Sandy Lyle's total score of 302:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Difference in Total Scores} = 302 - 289 = 13\n     \\]\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Vijay Singh's final score was less than 10 under Sandy Lyle's score.\n   - Since Vijay Singh's score is actually 13 strokes under Sandy Lyle's, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Vijay Singh's total score is 289 with a 'to par' of +1. Sandy Lyle's total score is 302 with a 'to par' of +14. Calculating the course par for Sandy Lyle gives 288 (302 - 14). Vijay Singh's score relative to this par is +1 (289 - 288), meaning his score was 13 strokes under Sandy Lyle's total score (302 - 289 = 13). Therefore, Vijay Singh's final score is not less than 10 under Sandy Lyle's; it is 13 under.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
