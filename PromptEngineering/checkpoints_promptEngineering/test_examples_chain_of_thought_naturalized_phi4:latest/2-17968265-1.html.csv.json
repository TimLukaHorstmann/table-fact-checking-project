    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify three conditions from the table: \n\n1. A team has played 114 matches.\n2. The same team has scored a total of 107 points.\n3. The team achieved 31 points in the year \"1987 - 88\".\n\nLet's evaluate these step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Teams with 114 Matches Played\n\n- From the table, several teams have played 114 matches:\n  - Row 1: Independiente\n  - Row 2: Newell 's Old Boys\n  - Row 3: San Lorenzo\n  - Row 4: Racing Club\n  - Row 5: Boca Juniors\n  - Row 6: River Plate\n  - Row 7: Rosario Central\n  - Row 8: Deportivo Espa\u00f1ol\n  - Row 9: Gimnasia de la Plata\n  - Row 10: V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield\n  - Row 11: Estudiantes de La Plata\n  - Row 12: Argentinos Juniors\n  - Row 13: Talleres de C\u00f3rdoba\n  - Row 14: Ferro Carril Oeste\n  - Row 16: Platense\n  - Row 17: Instituto de C\u00f3rdoba\n  - Row 18: Racing de C\u00f3rdoba\n\n### Step 2: Find Teams with 107 Points\n\n- From the table, the team with 107 points is:\n  - Row 14: Ferro Carril Oeste\n\n### Step 3: Check for 31 Points in \"1987 - 88\"\n\n- For Ferro Carril Oeste (Row 14), check the column for \"1987 - 88\":\n  - The team has 33 points, not 31.\n\n### Verification\n\nSince Ferro Carril Oeste is the only team with both 114 matches played and 107 points, but does not have 31 points in \"1987 - 88\", the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n- Row 14, Column \"points\": 107\n- Row 14, Column \"played\": 114\n- Row 14, Column \"1987 - 88\": 33\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified teams with 114 matches played.
