    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about crowd participation at venues is true or false, we need to examine the table's data regarding crowds for each game.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Crowd Data:**\n   - Look for the \"crowd\" column in the table which lists the number of participants for each venue.\n   \n2. **Extract Venue and Crowd Information:**\n   - Row 1: Venue - Kardinia Park, Crowd - 22500\n   - Row 2: Venue - Victoria Park, Crowd - 12000\n   - Row 3: Venue - Princes Park, Crowd - 29500\n   - Row 4: Venue - MCG, Crowd - 11000\n   - Row 5: Venue - Lake Oval, Crowd - 12500\n   - Row 6: Venue - Western Oval, Crowd - 12500\n\n3. **Identify Venues with Specific Crowd Numbers:**\n   - According to the claim, we are looking for venues that recorded a crowd of 11000 each.\n   - From the data extracted:\n     - MCG has a crowd of 11000 (Row 4).\n     - Western Oval has a crowd of 12500 (Row 6), not 11000.\n\n4. **Determine if There Are Two Venues with Crowd of 11000:**\n   - We only found one venue, the MCG, with a recorded crowd of 11000.\n   - Therefore, there is no second venue matching this specific criterion.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that Western Oval is one of two venues with 11000 each, which is incorrect as Western Oval has a different crowd count (12500).\n   - Thus, the claim is FALSE because only one venue recorded a crowd of 11000 and not two.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the 'crowd' column to find the number of participants for each game.\",\n    \"Extract the venues and corresponding crowds: Kardinia Park (22500), Victoria Park (12000), Princes Park (29500), MCG (11000), Lake Oval (12500), Western Oval (12500).\",\n    \"Look for venues with a crowd of 11000.\",\n    \"Only MCG has a recorded crowd of 11000, not two venues including Western Oval.\",\n    \"Conclude that the claim is false as only one venue matches the criterion.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: We are comparing the crowd sizes of two venues: Kardinia Park and Lake Oval.\n\n2. **Locate Crowd Information for Kardinia Park**:\n   - From Row 1, we find that the venue is Kardinia Park.\n   - The crowd size at Kardinia Park is given as 22,500.\n\n3. **Locate Crowd Information for Lake Oval**:\n   - From Row 5, we see that the venue is Lake Oval.\n   - The crowd size at Lake Oval is given as 12,500.\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference in Crowds**:\n   - Subtract the crowd size of Lake Oval from Kardinia Park: 22,500 (Kardinia Park) - 12,500 (Lake Oval) = 10,000.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**: \n   - The claim states that Kardinia Park has \"a 10000 crowd participant more than that of the lake oval venue.\"\n   - Our calculation shows a difference of exactly 10,000 participants.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The calculated difference matches the claim precisely.\n   - Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's present this reasoning in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the venues mentioned in the claim: Kardinia Park and Lake Oval.\",\n    \"From Row 1, locate crowd size for Kardinia Park: 22,500.\",\n    \"From Row 5, locate crowd size for Lake Oval: 12,500.\",\n    \"Calculate the difference in crowd sizes: 22,500 - 12,500 = 10,000.\",\n    \"The claim states a difference of 10,000 participants, which matches our calculation.\",\n    \"Thus, the claim is TRUE.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
