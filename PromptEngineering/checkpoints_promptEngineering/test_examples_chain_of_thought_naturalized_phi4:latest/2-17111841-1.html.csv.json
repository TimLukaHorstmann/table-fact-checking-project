    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the least watched episode number with an original airdate of 8 june 2008 be 4\" is true or false, let's follow a structured reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify the Episode with Airdate '8 June 2008':**\n   - From Row 4 in the table, we have:\n     - episode: 4\n     - original airdate: 8 june 2008\n     - viewers (millions): 1.364\n\n2. **Determine if This is the Least Watched Episode for that Date:**\n   - Since there's only one episode listed with the airdate '8 June 2008', it automatically becomes both the least and most watched episode for that date.\n   - There are no other episodes to compare viewership figures against for this specific date.\n\n3. **Check the Claim Against Identified Data:**\n   - The claim states \"the least watched episode number with an original airdate of 8 june 2008 be 4\".\n   - From our identification, Episode 4 is indeed the only episode aired on '8 June 2008' and has viewership data as 1.364 million.\n   - Therefore, it satisfies the condition of being the least watched (as it's the sole entry) with an original airdate of '8 June 2008'.\n\nBased on these steps, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows that Row 4 corresponds to episode number 4 aired on 8 June 2008.
