Therefore, the 19th event will correspond to the 19th row in the table, which is for the year 1936.\n   \n2. **Check Class Designation for Each Row**:\n   - We need to inspect each row from Year 1 (1924) through Year 19 (1936), focusing on the \"class\" column to see how many rows do not list \"grand prix\".\n\n3. **Count Non-Grand Prix Classes**:\n   - For each year, we'll determine if the class is \"grand prix\". If it isn't, we count that row.\n\n4. **Specifically Verify Year 19 (1936)**:\n   - Check specifically for Row 19 to confirm its classification to ensure accuracy regarding the claim about the number of non-grand prix races up to and including this year.\n\n### Detailed Evaluation:\n\n- **Row 1 (1924)**: Class = \"grand prix\"\n- **Row 2 (1925)**: Class = \"grand prix\"\n- **Row 3 (1926)**: Class = \"grand prix\"\n- **Row 4 (1927)**: Class = \"grand prix\"\n- **Row 5 (1928)**: Not Held\n- **Row 6 (1929)**: Class = \"grand prix\"\n- **Row 7 (1930)**: Class = \"grand prix\"\n- **Row 8 (1931)**: Class = \"grand prix\"\n- **Row 9 (1932)**: Class = \"grand prix\"\n- **Row 10 (1933)**: Class = \"grand prix\"\n- **Row 11 (1934)**: Class = \"grand prix\"\n- **Row 12 (1935)**: Class = \"grand prix\"\n- **Row 13 (1936)**: Class = \"grand prix\"\n\nFrom the above evaluation, rows with non-\"grand prix\" classes or not held are:\n- Row 5: Year 1928\n- Rows are numbered sequentially. \n\nThus, there is only 1 row (\"not held\") that does not list \"grand prix\" from Year 1 to Year 19.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that 19 of the games (years) should be non-\"grand prix\".
