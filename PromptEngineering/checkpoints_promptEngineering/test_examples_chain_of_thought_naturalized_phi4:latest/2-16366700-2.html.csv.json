    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"no 2 player have score the same total number of goal\" is true or false, we need to examine the \"total\" column for each row in the table. This column shows the combined number of regular season and playoff games played by each player. We will compare these values to see if any two players have the same total.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Extract Total Values**: List out the \"total\" numbers from each row:\n   - Row 1: 666\n   - Row 2: 600\n   - Row 3: 451\n   - Row 4: 438\n   - Row 5: 331\n   - Row 6: 302\n   - Row 7: 281\n   - Row 8: 269\n   - Row 9: 268\n   - Row 10: 268\n\n2. **Identify Duplicates**: Compare the totals to identify if any values are repeated:\n   - The total for Row 9 is 268.\n   - The total for Row 10 is also 268.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Since Rows 9 and 10 both have a total of 268, two players (Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram) have the same total number of games played. Therefore, the claim that \"no 2 player have score the same total number of goal\" is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells**:\n- Row 9: {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n- Row 10: {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Extract the 'total' values from each row in the table.\",\n    \"List the total values: 666, 600, 451, 438, 331, 302, 281, 269, 268, 268.\",\n    \"Identify any duplicate total values.\",\n    \"Rows 9 and 10 both have a total of 268.\",\n    \"Since two players have the same total number of games played, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
