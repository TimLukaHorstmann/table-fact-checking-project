However, since it is historical data from 1903-1904, we can assume that the team in question might be Manchester United or a predecessor club (such as Newton Heath).\n   \n2. **Examine Each Row for Opponent Details:**\n   - **Row 1:** Date: 12 December 1903, Opponents: Small Heath\n   - **Row 2:** Date: 16 December 1903, Opponents: Small Heath\n   - **Row 3:** Date: 21 December 1903, Opponents: Small Heath\n   - **Row 4:** Date: 11 January 1904, Opponents: Small Heath\n\n   From these rows, we observe that in the first four games, the opponents are consistently \"Small Heath,\" not Notts County.\n\n3. **Check for Notts County as an Opponent:**\n   - **Row 5:** Date: 6 February 1904, Opponents: Notts County\n     - This indicates that Notts County is the opponent starting from the fifth game (Round 1), not within the first four games.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Notts County appears as an opponent only in Row 5 and beyond, they are not opponents in any of the first four games.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant cells that provide information about the opponents for each game are found in the \"opponents\" column across rows 1 to 4.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Notts County were opponents in the first four games.
