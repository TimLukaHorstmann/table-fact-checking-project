    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"all 3 of the drawn match be goalless\" is true or false, we need to identify all the matches that ended in a draw from the table and then check their scores.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Drawn Matches:**\n   - A drawn match is one where both teams have scored the same number of goals.\n   - In this table, each row represents a match with a \"score\" column indicating the results in \"home score - away score.\"\n\n2. **Examine Each Match for Draws:**\n   - Row 1: Score 3-1 (Not a draw)\n   - Row 2: Score 1-0 (Not a draw)\n   - Row 3: Score 3-2 (Not a draw)\n   - Row 4: Score 1-0 (Not a draw)\n   - Row 5: Score 1-0 (Not a draw)\n   - Row 6: Score 0-0 (Draw)\n   - Row 7: Score 1-0 (Replay, not a drawn match)\n   - Row 8: Score 1-1 (Draw)\n   - Row 9: Score 5-0 (Result of replay, not original draw)\n   - Row 10: Score 3-1 (Not a draw)\n   - Row 11: Score 2-0 (Not a draw)\n   - Row 12: Score 3-1 (Not a draw)\n   - Row 13: Score 2-1 (Not a draw)\n   - Row 14: Score 0-1 (Not a draw)\n   - Row 15: Score 1-1 (Draw)\n   - Row 16: Score 0-3 (Replay, not original draw)\n   - Row 17: Score 0-1 (Not a draw)\n   - Row 18: Score 0-2 (Not a draw)\n   - Row 19: Score 1-0 (Not a draw)\n\n3. **List All Drawn Matches:**\n   - From the examination, we have three drawn matches:\n     - Row 6: Score 0-0\n     - Row 8: Score 1-1\n     - Row 15: Score 1-1\n\n4. **Check if All Draws are Goalless:**\n   - A goalless draw means both teams scored 0 goals.\n   - For Row 6, the score is 0-0 (Goalless).\n   - For Row 8, the score is 1-1 (Not goalless).\n   - For Row 15, the score is 1-1 (Not goalless).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Not all drawn matches were goalless as Rows 8 and 15 had scores of 1-1.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe claim \"all 3 of the drawn match be goalless\" is FALSE because two of the three draws involved goals being scored by both teams (Rows 8 and 15).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify all matches with a draw, which are Rows 6, 8, and 15. Check their scores: Row 6 has a score of 0-0 (goalless), while Rows 8 and 15 both have a score of 1-1 (not goalless). Thus, not all drawn matches were goalless.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
