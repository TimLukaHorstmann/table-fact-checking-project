    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, let's go through a step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states, \"the university of southern california play a round lower than 5.\" This implies we are looking for an instance where someone from the University of Southern California was selected in rounds earlier than round 5.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**: We need to find any row(s) in the table that mention the University of Southern California (USC).\n\n3. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: School is Miami-Dade College, not USC.\n   - **Row 2**: School is the University of Michigan, not USC.\n   - **Row 3**: School is Trinity University, not USC.\n   - **Row 4**: School is Gulf Coast Community College, not USC.\n   - **Row 5**: School is the University of Southern California.\n\n4. **Analyze Row 5**:\n   - The round for John Herbst from the University of Southern California is 5.\n   - Since we are looking for rounds lower than 5 (i.e., rounds 1, 2, 3, or 4), round 5 does not satisfy this condition.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: There is no entry in the table where a player from the University of Southern California was selected in a round lower than 5. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Cell**:\n   - The relevant cell for this analysis is Row 5, specifically the \"round\" and \"school\" columns, as they provide the necessary information to evaluate the claim.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that someone from the University of Southern California was selected in a round lower than 5. Upon examining each row, only Row 5 mentions USC, and it indicates a selection in Round 5. Since there is no entry for rounds 1 through 4, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"school\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
