    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"2 - third of home team have score higher than 10.0\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that two-thirds (which mathematically rounds to approximately 67%) of the home teams in the table scored more than 10 goals.\n\n2. **Count Total Home Teams:**\n   - There are six rows in the table, each representing a different game with its own home team and score.\n   - Thus, there are 6 home teams in total.\n\n3. **Determine Two-Thirds of Home Teams:**\n   - Calculate two-thirds of 6: \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 6 = 4 \\).\n   - Therefore, the claim requires at least 4 out of the 6 home teams to have scored more than 10 goals.\n\n4. **Evaluate Each Home Team's Score:**\n   - Row 1: Hawthorn, score 14.12 (96) \u2014 More than 10 goals.\n   - Row 2: Fitzroy, score 8.10 (58) \u2014 Less than 10 goals.\n   - Row 3: Richmond, score 8.18 (66) \u2014 Less than 10 goals.\n   - Row 4: Geelong, score 7.10 (52) \u2014 Less than 10 goals.\n   - Row 5: Essendon, score 12.9 (81) \u2014 More than 10 goals.\n   - Row 6: South Melbourne, score 10.12 (72) \u2014 Exactly 10 goals.\n\n5. **Count Home Teams with Scores Greater Than 10 Goals:**\n   - Hawthorn and Essendon scored more than 10 goals.\n   - Only these two teams meet the criteria of having more than 10 goals.\n\n6. **Compare Against Required Number:**\n   - We need at least 4 home teams to have scores higher than 10, but only 2 teams (Hawthorn and Essendon) do so.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since only 2 out of the 6 home teams scored more than 10 goals, which is less than the required 4, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's format this reasoning into a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires two-thirds (approximately 67%) of the home teams to have scores higher than 10.0.
