    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Guillermo Franco scoring goals in friendly competitions versus 2010 FIFA World Cup competitions is true or false, we need to analyze the data provided in the table for each type of competition.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Friendly Competitions:**\n   - We look at the \"competition\" column to find rows where the competition is labeled as \"friendly.\"\n   - Row 2 indicates a friendly match on 1 March 2006, with Guillermo Franco scoring 1 goal.\n\n2. **Identify 2010 FIFA World Cup Qualifications (as proxies for World Cup competition):**\n   - The table does not explicitly list goals in the 2010 FIFA World Cup itself, only qualifications.\n   - We consider the \"competition\" column to find rows labeled as \"2010 fifa world cup qualification.\"\n   - Row 3: Date 10 June 2009, Venue Estadio Azteca, Score 1-0, Result 2-1. Franco scores 1 goal.\n   - Row 6: Date 5 September 2009, Venue Estadio Ricardo Saprissa, Score 0-2, Result 3-0. Franco scores 2 goals.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Goals in Each Competition Type:**\n   - For friendly competitions: \n     - From Row 2, Franco scored 1 goal.\n     - Total goals in friendlies = 1.\n   - For 2010 FIFA World Cup Qualifications:\n     - From Row 3, Franco scored 1 goal.\n     - From Row 6, Franco scored 2 goals.\n     - Total goals in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifications = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\n4. **Compare the Goal Counts:**\n   - Friendly competitions: 1 goal.\n   - 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifications: 3 goals.\n   - The claim states that Franco scored the same number of goals in friendlies as in the 2010 FIFA World Cup competition (or its qualification rounds, since direct matches aren't listed).\n   - Since 1 (friendly) \u2260 3 (qualifications), the claim is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim that \"Guillermo Franco scored a goal at friendly competitions the same amount as at 2010 FIFA World Cup competition\" is false. The relevant rows are those where goals were recorded in each type of competition.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identified friendlies and 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifications from the table.
