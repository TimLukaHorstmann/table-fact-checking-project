    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that \"Naomi Cavaday was one of two opponents to play on a hard surface.\" This means there should be exactly two matches in the table where the surface is hard, and Naomi Cavaday should be the opponent in one of those matches.\n\n2. **Identify Matches on Hard Surface**:\n   - Look through each row in the table and identify the rows where the \"surface\" column indicates \"hard.\"\n\n3. **Count Matches on Hard Surface**:\n   - Count how many matches are played on a hard surface.\n\n4. **Check for Naomi Cavaday as Opponent**:\n   - Verify if Naomi Cavaday is listed as an opponent in one of those matches identified as being played on a hard surface.\n\n5. **Verify the Number of Matches with Hard Surface**:\n   - Ensure that there are exactly two matches played on a hard surface to satisfy the condition of her being \"one of 2.\"\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Hard Surface**:\n   - Row 6: The surface is listed as \"hard.\" Opponent is Naomi Cavaday.\n\n2. **Count Matches on Hard Surface**:\n   - We identified only one match (Row 6) where the surface was hard.\n\n3. **Check for Other Hard Surface Matches**:\n   - No other row in the table has the surface listed as \"hard.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - There is only one match played on a hard surface, not two. Therefore, Naomi Cavaday cannot be \"one of 2\" opponents to play on a hard surface.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires identifying matches played on a hard surface and checking if Naomi Cavaday was an opponent in one of those matches. Only one match (Row 6) is identified as being played on a hard surface, where Naomi Cavaday was the opponent. Since there are not two such matches, the claim that she was 'one of 2' opponents on a hard surface is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
