This part of the claim is correct.\n\n2. **Second Part: \"have a vca 155 of 18hp / t (16.5hp / ton)\"**\n   - According to Row 4, Column 'vca 155': The power-to-weight ratio for vca 155 is indeed 18hp/t or 16.5hp/ton. This part of the claim is also correct.\n\n3. **Third Part: \"and not 55 km / h (34 mph)\"**\n   - According to Row 5, Column 'vca 155': The speed for vca 155 is stated as 55 km/h or 34 mph.\n   - The claim states that vctp does not have this speed. It specifically refers to the speed of \"vca 155,\" not \"vctp.\"\n   - Therefore, the statement about speeds is irrelevant when discussing power-to-weight ratios for vctp and vca 155. This part of the claim is essentially a non-relevant condition since it doesn't affect the truth value concerning the stated power-to-weight ratios.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe relevant parts of the claim are true because both the power-to-weight ratio values mentioned match those in the table. The statement about speed does not contradict any information but rather specifies that vctp's speed is not 55 km/h (34 mph), which aligns with the fact that Row 5 lists a different speed for vctp.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe claim is TRUE based on the power-to-weight ratios provided in the table.
