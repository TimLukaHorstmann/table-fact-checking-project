According to the table:\n     - Row 3 has the date \"july 8\".\n\n2. **Check the Score and Result in the Identified Row:**\n   - In Row 3, the score is listed as \"l 50 - 48\".\n   - The letter 'l' indicates that the game was a loss.\n\n3. **Compare with the Claimed Score:**\n   - The claim states the score should be \"50 - 48\" for it to be a loss.\n   - The actual score from Row 3 is indeed \"50 - 48\", and it is marked as a loss ('l').\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the score \"50 - 48\" matches the claimed score and is associated with a loss, the claim is accurate based on the table data.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the game on July 8 did indeed have a score of 50 - 48, resulting in a loss.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified row for date 'july 8' (Row 3), checked the score and result.
