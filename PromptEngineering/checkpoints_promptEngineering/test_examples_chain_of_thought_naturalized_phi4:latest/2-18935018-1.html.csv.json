    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"north decatur and south decatur have the exact same number of student enrol\" is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant rows for each school**: \n   - North Decatur is listed in Row 5.\n   - South Decatur is listed in Row 6.\n\n2. **Locate the enrollment information**:\n   - For North Decatur (Row 5), find the \"enrollment\" column to get the number of students enrolled.\n   - For South Decatur (Row 6), similarly, locate the \"enrollment\" column for their student count.\n\n3. **Compare the enrollment numbers**:\n   - Extract and compare the values in the \"enrollment\" column for both rows to see if they match.\n\n4. **Conclusion based on comparison**:\n   - If the enrollment numbers are identical, the claim is true.\n   - If the enrollment numbers differ, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n- **North Decatur (Row 5)**: \n  - Enrollment: 397\n\n- **South Decatur (Row 6)**:\n  - Enrollment: 316\n\nThe enrollment numbers for North Decatur and South Decatur are 397 and 316, respectively. Since these numbers are not the same, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the relevant rows: North Decatur (Row 5), South Decatur (Row 6).\",\n    \"Locate and extract enrollment data: North Decatur enrollment is 397, South Decatur enrollment is 316.\",\n    \"Compare the enrollment numbers: 397 (North Decatur) \u2260 316 (South Decatur).\",\n    \"Since the enrollments are different, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
