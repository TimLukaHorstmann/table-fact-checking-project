    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"more than 3 episodes of The Brady Bunch's first season were written by women\" is true or false, we need to identify which writers are female based on their names and count how many episodes they wrote.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Female Writers:**\n   - We assume that traditionally feminine names likely indicate a female writer. From the table:\n     - Lois Hires (Episode 2)\n     - Joanna Lee (Episode 3)\n     - Ruth Brooks Flippen (Episodes 9, 13, and 16)\n   \n2. **Count Episodes Written by Identified Female Writers:**\n   - Lois Hires wrote Episode 2.\n   - Joanna Lee wrote Episode 3.\n   - Ruth Brooks Flippen wrote Episodes 9, 13, and 16.\n\n3. **Total Count of Episodes:**\n   - Lois Hires: 1 episode\n   - Joanna Lee: 1 episode\n   - Ruth Brooks Flippen: 3 episodes\n\n4. **Calculate Total:**\n   - Adding these together gives us a total of 5 episodes written by the identified female writers.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that more than 3 episodes were written by women.
