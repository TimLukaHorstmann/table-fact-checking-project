    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, let's analyze it step-by-step using the information from the table:\n\n1. **Identify the Components of the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that on August 13th, 1966:\n     - The home team was Collingwood.\n     - The away team was North Melbourne.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Row:**\n   - All games occurred on the same date (August 13th, 1966), so we need to find the specific row that matches both teams mentioned in the claim.\n   - We look for a match where Collingwood is listed as the home team and North Melbourne as the away team.\n\n3. **Examine Row 3:**\n   - Home Team: Collingwood\n   - Away Team: North Melbourne\n   - Date: 13 August 1966\n\n4. **Verify the Match:**\n   - The details in Row 3 exactly match the components of the claim.\n     - The home team is indeed Collingwood.\n     - The away team is indeed North Melbourne.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Row 3 confirms that on August 13th, 1966, Collingwood was the home team and North Melbourne was the away team, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim specifies that on August 13th, 1966, Collingwood was the home team and North Melbourne was the away team.\",\n    \"All games occurred on this date, so we need to identify the specific match with these teams.\",\n    \"Row 3 lists Collingwood as the home team and North Melbourne as the away team on August 13th, 1966.\",\n    \"The details in Row 3 confirm the claim is true.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
