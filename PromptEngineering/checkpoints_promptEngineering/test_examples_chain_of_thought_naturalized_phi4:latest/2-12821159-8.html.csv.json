We must find the row where Rick Huiskamp is listed as the runner-up.\n\n2. **Locate Rick Huiskamp in the table:**\n   - Row 1: Runner-up is Wolfgang H\u00fcget.\n   - Row 2: Runner-up is Mark Grabow Schytter.\n   - Row 3: Runner-up is Rick Huiskamp.\n   - Row 4: Runner-up is Lasse Jensen.\n   - Row 5: Runner-up is Richard Treis.\n   - Row 6: Runner-up is Christoph G\u00fcnther.\n\n   From this, we see that Rick Huiskamp is the runner-up in Row 3.\n\n3. **Verify the margin of victory for the tournament in Row 3:**\n   - In Row 3, the margin of victory is listed as \"10 strokes.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The claim states that Rick Huiskamp's margin of victory was 10 strokes.
