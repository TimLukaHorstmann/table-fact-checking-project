    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify each part of it against the data in the table for the specified conditions: week of May 8, tier I.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - The claim specifies \"week of may 8\" and \"tier 1\". We need to find rows that match these criteria.\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 5: Matches both conditions (week of 8 May, tier I).\n     - Row 6: Matches both conditions (week of 8 May, tier I).\n\n2. **Verify Winner for Tier I on Week of 8 May:**\n   - According to Row 5, the winner is \"conchita mart\u00ednez\" with a score of \"6 - 3 , 6 - 1\".\n   - According to Row 6, the winner is \"gigi fern\u00e1ndez natalia zvereva\" with a score of \"3 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 4\".\n\n3. **Verify Runner-Up for Tier I on Week of 8 May:**\n   - According to Row 5, the runner-up is \"arantxa s\u00e1nchez vicario\".\n   - According to Row 6, the runner-up is \"conchita mart\u00ednez patricia tarabini\".\n\n4. **Verify Semi-Finalists for Tier I on Week of 8 May:**\n   - According to Row 5, the semi-finalists are \"helena sukov\u00e1 mary pierce\".\n   - According to Row 6, the semi-finalists are also \"helena sukov\u00e1 mary pierce\".\n\n5. **Analyze the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"gigi fern\u00e1ndez natalia zvereva 3 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 4\" should be winners.\n     - This matches Row 6, but not Row 5. Thus, they are only winners in one of the two tier I events on May 8.\n   - The claim states \"conchita mart\u00ednez patricia tarabini\" as runners-up.\n     - This matches Row 6, but not Row 5. They are runners-up in only one of the two tier I events on May 8.\n   - The claim states \"helena sukov\u00e1 mary pierce\" as semi-finalists.\n     - This is true for both Row 5 and Row 6.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is partially correct but not fully accurate because it does not account for the fact that there are two separate tier I events on May 8, each with different winners, runners-up, and semi-finalists. Therefore, while \"gigi fern\u00e1ndez natalia zvereva\" are indeed winners in one of those events, they are not the winners of both. Similarly, \"conchita mart\u00ednez patricia tarabini\" are runners-up in only one event.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim is evaluated against two rows for the week of May 8, tier I.
