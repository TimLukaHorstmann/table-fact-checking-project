This means he is 3 strokes under par.\n   - **Row 2:** Jack Nicklaus has a \"to par\" of \"-1\". This means he is 1 stroke under par.\n   - **Row 3 to Row 10:** All players have a \"to par\" score that is either even (e) or positive, indicating they are at par or over par.\n\n4. **Count Players Under Par:**\n   - From the analysis above, only Jim Simons and Jack Nicklaus scored under par.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - There are exactly 2 players who scored under par according to the table data.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The 'to par' column indicates how many strokes under or over par each player finished.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate each golfer's performance across their three rounds to see if more than 3 golfers scored under par on all three individual rounds.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding \"Under Par\":**\n   - A score under par means scoring fewer strokes than the course's par for that round. In the table, this is represented by a negative value in the \"to par\" column for each total score.\n   - To be under par on an individual round, the golfer's score for that round must be less than the par of that specific hole.\n\n2. **Extracting Individual Round Scores:**\n   - For each player, we have three scores (one per round) which are summed to give the total score and \"to par\" value.\n   - We need to check if each individual score is under par (less than the implied par for that round).\n\n3. **Evaluating Each Golfer:**\n\n   - **Row 1: Jim Simons**\n     - Round scores: 71, 71, 65\n     - \"To par\" total: -3 implies the course's total par is 210.\n     - Calculate implied par per round: Total score (207) minus \"to par\" (-3) = 210. Therefore, each round's par must add up to 70 since 70 + 71 + 69 = 210.\n     - Round scores vs. par:\n       - Round 1: 71 (not under par)\n       - Round 2: 71 (not under par)\n       - Round 3: 65 (under par, since 65 < 69)\n\n   - **Row 2: Jack Nicklaus**\n     - Round scores: 69, 72, 68\n     - \"To par\" total: -1 implies the course's total par is 210.\n     - Round scores vs. par:\n       - Round 1: 69 (under par)\n       - Round 2: 72 (not under par)\n       - Round 3: 68 (under par)\n\n   - **Row 3: Bobby Nichols**\n     - Round scores: 69, 72, 69\n     - \"To par\" total: E implies the course's total par is 210.\n     - Round scores vs. par:\n       - Round 1: 69 (under par)\n       - Round 2: 72 (not under par)\n       - Round 3: 69 (under par)\n\n   - **Row 4-7: Lee Trevino, George Archer, Jim Colbert, Bob Erickson**\n     - All have \"to par\" of +1 and total score of 211.\n     - Implied course par is 212.\n     - Each round's par must add up to 71 since 71 + 72 + 68 = 211.\n     - None scored under par on all three rounds.\n\n   - **Row 8-10: Ken Still, Larry Hinson, Bruce Devlin**\n     - All have \"to par\" of +2 and total score of 212.\n     - Implied course par is 214.\n     - Each round's par must add up to 71 since 71 + 72 + 69 = 212.\n     - None scored under par on all three rounds.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Only Jim Simons and Jack Nicklaus have two rounds under par, but not all three.\n   - Bobby Nichols also has two rounds under par, but not all three.\n   - No golfer scored under par in all three rounds.\n\n5. **Final Assessment:**\n   - The claim is that more than 3 golfers scored under par on each of the three separate rounds. This is false because no golfer achieved this feat.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, we determined what 'under par' means for individual rounds and extracted each player's round scores.
