According to the table:\n   - Row 10 has \"february\" as 21, indicating that this game was played on February 21.\n\n3. **Check the Score for February 21:**\n   Next, we look at the \"score\" column in Row 10 to verify if it matches \"5 - 4\":\n   - In Row 10, the score is listed as \"5 - 4.\"\n\n4. **Compare with Claim:**\n   The claim states that on February 21, there was a game with a score of \"5 - 4.\" This matches exactly with what we found in Row 10.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim accurately reflects the data from the table for the date and score specified.\n- Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the column for dates: 'february'.\",\n    \"Locate February 21 in the 'february' column.\",\n    \"Check the 'score' column for Row 10 where February 21 is listed.\",\n    \"Verify if the score matches '5 - 4' as stated in the claim.\",\n    \"Conclude that the claim matches the data and is therefore TRUE.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"february\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
