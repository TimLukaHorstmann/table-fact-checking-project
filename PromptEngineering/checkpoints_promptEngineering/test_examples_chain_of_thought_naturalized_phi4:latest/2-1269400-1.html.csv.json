We locate this event in Row 1 of the table.\n   \n2. **Check Individual Participation**: The column labeled \"individual\" for Row 1 contains a \"-\", indicating that no individual result is recorded for this event.\n\n3. **Check Sprint Result**: The column labeled \"sprint\" for Row 1 shows \"32nd\". This indicates that there was a sprint event, and the position achieved was 32nd.\n\n4. **Determine Participation**: Since the \"individual\" column is \"-\", it implies no specific individual's name or result is associated with this row. Therefore, we cannot confirm Tomasz Sikora's participation based on this data alone.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The table does not provide any information about Tomasz Sikora specifically participating in the 1994 Lillehammer event.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the provided table for any data related to Tomasz S\u0142oma (note: there seems to be a misunderstanding with the name \"Tomasz Sikora,\" as the events listed are associated with Tomasz S\u0142oma based on known information about cross-country skiing). Let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that \"tomasz sikora do have a value for the individual in the 2011 vancouver event.\" This implies we need to check if there is an entry for Tomasz S\u0142oma (assuming the name correction) related to the individual performance at the 2011 Vancouver event.\n\n2. **Examine Table Rows**: We will inspect each row of the table to see if it includes any data for a \"Vancouver\" event in the year 2011 and specifically look for an entry under the \"individual\" column.\n   - Row 1: 1994 Lillehammer\n   - Row 2: 1998 Nagano - Nozawa\n   - Row 3: 2002 Salt Lake City\n   - Row 4: 2006 Turin\n   - Row 5: 2010 Vancouver\n\n3. **Check for the Year and Event**: The table lists events from different years, but there is no row corresponding to a \"Vancouver\" event in the year 2011.\n   - The only mention of Vancouver is in Row 5, which corresponds to the 2010 event.\n\n4. **Verify the Individual Column for 2011**: Since there's no row for 2011 in the table, we cannot find any data related to the individual performance at a 2011 Vancouver event.\n   - Specifically, Row 5 (2010 Vancouver) does have an entry under \"individual\" but this is not relevant as it pertains to 2010, not 2011.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the absence of any row for the 2011 Vancouver event in the table and no data under the \"individual\" column related to such an event, we can conclude that the claim is false.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table does not include a row for the 2011 Vancouver event. The only mention of Vancouver pertains to 2010, which is unrelated to the year in question. Therefore, there is no data available for Tomasz S\u0142oma's individual performance at a 2011 Vancouver event.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
