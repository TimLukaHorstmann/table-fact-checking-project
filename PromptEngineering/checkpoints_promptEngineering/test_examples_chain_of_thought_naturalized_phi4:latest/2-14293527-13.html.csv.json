There is no explicit mention of a player selected in round 2.\n\n5. **Conclusion Based on Available Data**:\n   - Since there is no row corresponding to round 2, we cannot find any defensive player from \"Estevan Bruins (WCHL)\" for that round.\n   - Therefore, based on the available data, the claim cannot be true as there is no information about round 2.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nGiven the steps above, the claim is false because there is no entry in the table for round 2. Thus, we cannot verify the presence of a defensive player from Estevan Bruins (WCHL) in that round based on the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires checking if there's a defensive player from 'Estevan Bruins (WCHL)' in round 2.
