    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify three aspects of it: \n1. The player named \"rene lampert\" must be a right wing.\n2. This player should have been picked as the 145th pick.\n3. Verify if there is any discrepancy in spelling or formatting.\n\nLet's break down these steps:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n1. **Verify the Player's Name:**\n   - The claim mentions \"rene lampert.\" However, according to Row 3, the player's name is \"rene lambert,\" not \"lampert.\"\n   \n2. **Check the Position of the Player:**\n   - According to Row 3, Rene Lambert's position is indeed a right wing.\n\n3. **Verify the Pick Number:**\n   - In Row 3, it is stated that Rene Lambert was picked as the 146th pick.\n   - The claim states that this player should be the 145th pick. However, according to Row 2, Steve Lyon was the 145th pick (not Rene Lambert).\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The name \"rene lampert\" does not match with any player in the table due to a spelling error; it should be \"rene lambert.\"\n- Even though Rene Lambert is indeed a right wing, he was picked as the 146th, not the 145th.\n- Hence, the claim \"right wing, rene lampert, be pick 145th\" is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nBased on our analysis, the relevant cells from the table are those concerning both Rene Lambert and Steve Lyon:\n- Row 2, Pick: 145 (Steve Lyon)\n- Row 3, Player: Rene Lambert, Position: Right Wing, Pick: 146\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states 'rene lampert' was a right wing and picked as the 145th. However, there is no player named 'rene lampert.' The correct name is 'rene lambert,' who is indeed a right wing but was picked at 146th, not 145th.
