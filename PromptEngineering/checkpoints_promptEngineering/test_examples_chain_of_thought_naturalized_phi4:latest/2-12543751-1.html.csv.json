From the table:\n   - Row 1: week: audition\n\n3. **Check the Original Artist for Audition Week:**  \n   In Row 1, we find:\n   - original artist: The Police\n\n4. **Determine if Lionel Richie is Mentioned in Audition Week:**  \n   Lionel Richie is not mentioned as an original artist during the audition week (Row 1).\n\n5. **Verify if Lionel Richie Appears Elsewhere:**  \n   We should also check other rows to see if Lionel Richie appears as an original artist:\n   - Row 5: original artist: Lionel Richie\n\n6. **Conclusion:**  \n   Lionel Richie is not associated with the audition week.
