    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Tom Lehman is true, we need to evaluate how many weeks each U.S. player from the table spent at number 1 and compare it with Tom Lehman's duration.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify U.S. Players:**\n   - From the table, extract rows where the country is \"united states.\"\n   \n2. **Extract Weeks for Each U.S. Player:**\n   - For each identified U.S. player, note the number of weeks they spent at rank 1.\n\n3. **Compare with Tom Lehman's Weeks:**\n   - Find Tom Lehman\u2019s data in the table and note his weeks.\n   - Compare Tom Lehman\u2019s weeks to those of other U.S. players to see if he has the highest.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n- **Row 1:** \n  - Player: Tiger Woods\n  - Country: United States\n  - Weeks at Rank 1: 656\n\n- **Row 11:** \n  - Player: Fred Couples\n  - Country: United States\n  - Weeks at Rank 1: 16\n\n- **Row 12:** \n  - Player: David Duval\n  - Country: United States\n  - Weeks at Rank 1: 15\n\n- **Row 16:** \n  - Player: Tom Lehman\n  - Country: United States\n  - Weeks at Rank 1: 1\n\n### Comparison:\n\n- Tiger Woods has 656 weeks, which is more than Tom Lehman's 1 week.\n- Fred Couples and David Duval have 16 and 15 weeks respectively, both more than Tom Lehman.\n\n**Conclusion:** Tom Lehman did not spend more weeks at number 1 than any other U.S. player.
