    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"selhurst park be the venue for 2 game\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table row by row and check how many times \"selhurst park\" appears as a venue.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - The relevant column for checking venues is the \"venue\" column in the table.\n\n2. **Check Each Row:**\n   - **Row 1:** \n     - Season: 1969-70 FA Cup\n     - Venue: Highbury\n     - Selhurst Park is not mentioned.\n   - **Row 2:**\n     - Season: 1970-71 FA Cup\n     - Venue: Selhurst Park\n     - This matches our venue of interest, so we count this as one occurrence.\n   - **Row 3:**\n     - Season: 1971-72 FA Cup\n     - Venue: St Andrew's\n     - Selhurst Park is not mentioned.\n   - **Row 4:**\n     - Season: 1972-73 FA Cup\n     - Venue: Highbury\n     - Selhurst Park is not mentioned.\n   - **Row 5:**\n     - Season: 1973-74 FA Cup\n     - Venue: Filbert Street\n     - Selhurst Park is not mentioned.\n\n3. **Count Occurrences:**\n   - From the analysis above, \"selhurst park\" appears as a venue only once (in Row 2).\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Selhurst Park was the venue for 2 games.\n   - Based on our count, it was the venue for only 1 game.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since \"selhurst park\" appears as a venue only once, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Checked each row's 'venue' column to see how many times 'selhurst park' appeared.
