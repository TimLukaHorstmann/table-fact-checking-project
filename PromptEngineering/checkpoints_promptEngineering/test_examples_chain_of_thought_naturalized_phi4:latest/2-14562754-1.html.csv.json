We will go through the steps below:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: We are interested in columns: \"remixed by\", \"version\", and \"year\". These columns help us determine if Laurent Boutonnat was involved in remixing a version of the song in 1995.\n\n2. **Filter for Year 1995**: We will focus on rows where the year is specified as 1995, as we are interested only in remixes done in that particular year.\n\n3. **Check Remixer Involvement**: For each row with the year 1995, check if Laurent Boutonnat's name appears in the \"remixed by\" column to confirm his involvement.\n\n4. **Count Remixes**: Count the number of versions remixed by Laurent Boutonnat in 1995.\n\nLet's go through each relevant row:\n\n- **Row 1**: Year is 1995, but \"remixed by: -\". Laurent Boutonnat did not remix this version.\n  \n- **Row 2**: Year is 1995 and \"remixed by: laurent boutonnat\". This counts as one remix.\n\n- **Row 3**: Year is 1995 and \"remixed by: laurent boutonnat, bertrand chtenet\". This counts as another remix (total now 2).\n\n- **Row 4**: Year is 1995 and \"remixed by: laurent boutonnat, bertrand chtenet\". Another remix counted (total now 3).\n\n- **Row 5**: Year is 1995 and \"remixed by: laurent boutonnat, bertrand chtenet\". Another remix (total now 4).\n\n- **Row 6**: Year is 1995 and \"remixed by: laurent boutonnat, bertrand chtenet\". Another remix counted (total now 5).\n\n- **Row 7**: Year is 1995 and \"remixed by: laurent boutonnat, bertrand chtenet\". This adds another remix (total now 6).\n\n- **Row 8**: Year is 1995 and \"remixed by: laurent boutonnat, bertrand chtenet\". Another remix counted (total now 7).\n\n- **Row 9**: Year is 1995 and \"remixed by: laurent boutonnat, bertrand chtenet\". This adds another remix (total now 8).\n\nNo further rows for the year 1995 show Laurent Boutonnat as a remixer beyond these.\n\n**Conclusion**: Laurent Boutonnat did exactly 8 remixes of the song in 1995. The claim states \"more than 8\", which implies at least 9 remixes are needed to satisfy the claim, but we only have 8 confirmed for that year.\n\nNow, let's format this into the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Filtered rows by year 1995 and checked 'remixed by' column for Laurent Boutonnat.
