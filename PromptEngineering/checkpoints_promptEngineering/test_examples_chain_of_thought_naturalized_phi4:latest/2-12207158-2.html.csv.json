Otherwise, it's false.\n\nNow let\u2019s apply these steps:\n\n- **Step 1:** Look for rows where the \"record\" is \"4 - 5\".\n  - Row 9 has a record of \"4 - 5\".\n\n- **Step 2:** Check the opponent in that row.\n  - In Row 9, the \"opponent\" column shows \"yankees\".\n\nSince we found that when the record was \"4 - 5\", the opponent was indeed the \"yankees\", the claim is true.\n\nRelevant cells for our findings are:\n- Row 9: {\"column_name\": \"record\", \"value\": \"4 - 5\"}\n- Row 9: {\"column_name\": \"opponent\", \"value\": \"yankees\"}\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We identified that the record '4 - 5' corresponds to Row 9, where the opponent is listed as 'yankees'.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table data focusing on two key points: when the record was 4 - 5 and who the opponent was on April 11.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n\n1. **Identify the Record of 4 - 5:**\n   - We are looking for a row where the \"record\" column is \"4 - 5\".\n   \n2. **Examine Row 9:**\n   - According to the table, Row 9 has:\n     - Date: April 12\n     - Opponent: Yankees\n     - Score: 5 - 3\n     - Loss: Castillo (1 - 1)\n     - Attendance: 17900\n     - Record: 4 - 5\n\n   This matches the record of \"4 - 5\", so on April 12, the team's record was indeed 4 - 5.\n\n3. **Check the Opponent on April 11:**\n   - We need to verify what opponent they played against on April 11.\n   \n4. **Examine Row 8:**\n   - According to the table, Row 8 has:\n     - Date: April 11\n     - Opponent: Yankees\n     - Score: 11 - 6 (10)\n     - Loss: Righetti (0 - 1)\n     - Attendance: 20277\n     - Record: 4 - 4\n\n   On April 11, the opponent was indeed the Yankees.\n\n5. **Conclusion of Analysis:**\n   - The record became 4 - 5 after playing against the Yankees on April 12.\n   - On April 11, when the record was still 4 - 4, the opponent was also the Yankees.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"when the record be 4 - 5 , the opponent be yankee on april 11\" is FALSE because the record of 4 - 5 occurred after playing against the Yankees on April 12. On April 11, they had a record of 4 - 4, not 4 - 5.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the row with the record '4 - 5', which is Row 9 (April 12). Then, check the opponent on April 11 by examining Row 8. The opponent was Yankees on both dates, but the record of 4 - 5 occurred after playing against the Yankees on April 12.
