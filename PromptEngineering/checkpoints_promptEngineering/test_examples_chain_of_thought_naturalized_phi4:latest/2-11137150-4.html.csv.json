Therefore, it ranks highest based on the number of medals.\n\n#### Part 2: Austria is the Only Country to Win Bronze in the 1961 World Luge Championship\n\n- **Check for Other Nations with Bronze Medals:**\n  - Italy (Row 2): Bronze = 0\n  - West Germany (Row 3): Bronze = 0\n  - Poland (Row 4): Bronze = 0\n  - Switzerland (Row 5): Bronze = 0\n\n- **Conclusion:** Austria is indeed the only nation with a bronze medal count of 3, and no other country has won any bronze medals according to the table.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nBoth parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table.
