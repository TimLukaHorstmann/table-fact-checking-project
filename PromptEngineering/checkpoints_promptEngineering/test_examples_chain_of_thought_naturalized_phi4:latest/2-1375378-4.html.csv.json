In fact, `1 / 32` is approximately equal to `0.03125`.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the actual ratio from the table (`1 / 32`) does not match the claimed ratio of `40`, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cell for verifying this claim is in Row 3, under the \"ratio\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the unit in question: 'lot'.\",\n    \"Locate the row corresponding to 'lot': Row 3.\",\n    \"Find and examine the value in the 'ratio' column for 'lot': The ratio is 1 / 32.\",\n    \"Compare this with the claimed ratio of 40: They do not match (1/32 \u2260 40).\",\n    \"Conclude that the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"ratio\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
