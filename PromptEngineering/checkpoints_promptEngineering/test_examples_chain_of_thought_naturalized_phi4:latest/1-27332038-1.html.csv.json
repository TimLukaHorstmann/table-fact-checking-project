    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim \"the episode Elaine Ko write be direct by Michael Spiller,\" we need to verify two main points from the table:\n\n1. Identify the episodes written by Elaine Ko.\n2. Check if any of these episodes were directed by Michael Spiller.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Episodes Written by Elaine Ko:**\n   - Look through each row in the \"written by\" column to find entries mentioning Elaine Ko as a writer.\n\n2. **Check Directors for Identified Episodes:**\n   - For any episode(s) written by Elaine Ko, check the corresponding \"directed by\" entry to see if Michael Spiller is listed as the director.\n\n3. **Cross-Verification with Claim:**\n   - The claim states that an episode written by Elaine Ko was directed by Michael Spiller. We need to confirm this condition is met for any episode(s) identified in step 1.\n\n### Analysis\n\n- **Row 15:** \n  - Title: \"princess party\"\n  - Written by: Elaine Ko\n  - Directed by: Michael Spiller\n\nFrom the analysis, we find that Row 15 (\"princess party\") satisfies both conditions of the claim. Therefore, the episode written by Elaine Ko was indeed directed by Michael Spiller.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is true based on the information provided in Row 15 of the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify episodes written by Elaine Ko.\",\n    \"Row 15: 'princess party' is written by Elaine Ko.\",\n    \"Check if this episode was directed by Michael Spiller.\",\n    \"Row 15: Directed by Michael Spiller.\",\n    \"The claim that an episode written by Elaine Ko was directed by Michael Spiller is true.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"written by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
