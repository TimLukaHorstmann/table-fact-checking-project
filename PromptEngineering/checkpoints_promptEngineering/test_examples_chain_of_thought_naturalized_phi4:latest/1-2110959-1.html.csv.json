According to the table structure provided, each row corresponds to a specific season. We need to locate the row that lists the season as \"1948 - 49.\"\n\n2. **Locate the Column for Win Percentage (Pct %)**: Once we identify the correct row, we will look at the column labeled \"pct %\" which represents the win percentage.\n\n3. **Verify the Value**: Check if the value in the \"pct %\" column matches the claimed win percentage of 0.552.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Compare the verified value with the claim to determine its truthfulness.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**\n\n- **Step 1:** Identify the row for the season 1948 - 49.
