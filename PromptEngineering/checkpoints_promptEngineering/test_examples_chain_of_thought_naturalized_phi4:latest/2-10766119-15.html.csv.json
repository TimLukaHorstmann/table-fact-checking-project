    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"more crowd watch glenferrie oval than arden street oval\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to compare the crowd sizes for the games held at Glenferrie Oval and Arden Street Oval according to the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant rows:**\n   - Row 1 corresponds to a game at Arden Street Oval.\n   - Row 5 corresponds to a game at Glenferrie Oval.\n\n2. **Extract crowd sizes from these rows:**\n   - From Row 1 (Arden Street Oval), the crowd size is 6000.\n   - From Row 5 (Glenferrie Oval), the crowd size is 5000.\n\n3. **Compare the two crowd sizes:**\n   - Arden Street Oval had a crowd of 6000.\n   - Glenferrie Oval had a smaller crowd of 5000.\n\n4. **Determine if the claim is true or false:**\n   - The claim states that more people attended the game at Glenferrie Oval than at Arden Street Oval. \n   - Since 5000 (Glenferrie) is less than 6000 (Arden Street), the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 1, Column \"crowd\": 6000\n- Row 5, Column \"crowd\": 5000\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified relevant rows for Arden Street Oval and Glenferrie Oval. Extracted crowd sizes: 6000 for Arden Street and 5000 for Glenferrie. Compared the numbers and found that 5000 is less than 6000, thus the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
