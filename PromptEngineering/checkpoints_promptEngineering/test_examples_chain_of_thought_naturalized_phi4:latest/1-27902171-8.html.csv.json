We need to locate this record within the table.\n\n2. **Locate the Row**:\n   - By examining each row, we find that **Row 4** has the record \"33 - 27\" before the game and updates to \"34 - 27\" after the game.\n   - This indicates that after Game 61, the team's record becomes \"34 - 27\".\n\n3. **Check High Assists for N. McMillan in Row 4**:\n   - In Row 4, under the column \"high assists\", it is listed as \"N. McMillan (7)\".\n   - This confirms that N.
