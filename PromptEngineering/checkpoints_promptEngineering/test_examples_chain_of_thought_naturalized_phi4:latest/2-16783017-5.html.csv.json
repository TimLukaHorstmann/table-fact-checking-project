    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"2 of the first 3 draft picks come from the Cornwall Royals\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the relevant parts of the table for rounds 1 through 3.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the First Three Picks:**\n   - Round 1, Pick 11: Player is Brad Marsh.\n   - Round 2, Pick 19: (Not shown in the provided rows but implied as next after row 1).\n   - Round 3, Pick 47: Player is Tim Bernhardt.\n\n2. **Check the Club Team for Each Pick:**\n   - **Round 1, Pick 11:** Brad Marsh's club team is \"London Knights (OHA)\".\n   - **Round 2, Pick 19:** This row is not explicitly provided, but we know it is between rows 1 and 3. We need to check this information:\n     - Since the table starts at round 1 and continues sequentially, and no row for Round 2 is provided in the given data, we assume there might be a missing entry or it was omitted.\n   - **Round 3, Pick 47:** Tim Bernhardt's club team is \"Cornwall Royals (OHA)\".\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Picks from Cornwall Royals:**\n   - From the information available:\n     - Round 1: London Knights\n     - Round 2: Not provided in the table\n     - Round 3: Cornwall Royals\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - We have confirmed only one pick (Round 3) explicitly comes from the Cornwall Royals.\n   - The second round's information is missing, and without it, we cannot confirm that two of the first three picks are from the Cornwall Royals.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the available data, the claim that \"2 of the first 3 draft picks come from the Cornwall Royals\" is FALSE because only one pick (Round 3) is confirmed to be from the Cornwall Royals, and information for Round 2 is missing.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we will evaluate each part of the claim separately and verify it against the information provided in the table.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n\nThe claim states: \"the flame draft a man who 's last name be macrae and also a man who 's first name be macrae.\"\n\n1. **Last Name Analysis**:\n   - We need to check if there is any player whose last name is \"Macrae\".\n   - From the table, Row 3 lists a player: `jim macrae (f)`. Here, \"Macrae\" is indeed the last name.\n\n2. **First Name Analysis**:\n   - Now we need to verify if there is any player whose first name is \"Macrae\".\n   - In Row 3, the first name given is \"Jim\", not \"Macrae\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim requires both conditions (last name and first name being \"Macrae\") to be met by at least one person for it to be true.\n- We found that only the last name condition is satisfied. There is no player whose first name is \"Macrae\".\n- Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nTo support this conclusion, we need to reference specific cells from the table:\n\n- For checking the last name:\n  - Row 3: `player` column for confirmation of last name \"Macrae\".\n  \n- For checking the first name:\n  - Row 3: `player` column to verify that the first name is not \"Macrae\".\n\nHere is the final output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify if there's a player with last name 'Macrae'.\",\n    \"Check each row for a match.
