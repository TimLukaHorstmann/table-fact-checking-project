All rows fall within this range since the dates are from November 19, 1997, to February 18, 2004.\n\n2. **Check Venue for Each Match**:\n   - Row 1: Venue is \"llu\u00eds sitjar, palma, spain\" (Not Israel)\n   - Row 2: Venue is \"bala\u00eddos, vigo, spain\" (Not Israel)\n   - Row 3: Venue is \"ramat gan, tel aviv, israel\" (Israel)\n   - Row 4: Venue is \"olimpico, serravalle, san marino\" (Not Israel)\n   - Row 5: Venue is \"el madrigal, vila-real, spain\" (Not Israel)\n   - Row 6: Venue is \"el madrigal, vila-real, spain\" (Not Israel)\n   - Row 7: Venue is \"amsterdam arena, amsterdam, netherlands\" (Not Israel)\n   - Row 8: Venue is \"ko\u0161evo, sarajevo, bosnia and herzegovina\" (Not Israel)\n   - Row 9: Venue is \"olimpiyskiy, kiev, ukraine\" (Not Israel)\n   - Row 10: Venue is \"afonso henriques, guimar\u00e3es, portugal\" (Not Israel)\n   - Row 11: Venue is \"ullevaal, oslo, norway\" (Not Israel)\n   - Row 12: Venue is \"llu\u00eds companys, barcelona, spain\" (Not Israel)\n\n3. **Count Matches in Israel**: From the analysis above, only one match took place in Israel (Row 3).\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**: The claim states that three matches occurred in Israel between 1997 and 2004. However, we found only one such match.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because only one match was played in Israel during the specified period.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified all rows as relevant since they fall within 1997-2004.
