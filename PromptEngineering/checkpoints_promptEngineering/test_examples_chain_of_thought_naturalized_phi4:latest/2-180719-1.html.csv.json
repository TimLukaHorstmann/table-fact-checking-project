    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the Eurovision song contest results is true, we need to assess the point difference between the first place winner and the runner-up.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the First Place Winner:**\n   - The table lists the \"place\" of each entry.\n   - We look for the row with `place` equal to 1, which is Row 14.\n\n2. **Check Points for First Place Winner:**\n   - In Row 14, the artist Jean-Claude Pascal won with the song \"nous les amoureux.\"\n   - The points scored are listed as 31.\n\n3. **Identify the Runner-Up (Second Place):**\n   - We look for the row with `place` equal to 2, which is Row 15.\n\n4. **Check Points for Runner-Up:**\n   - In Row 15, The Allisons had their song \"are you sure\" placed at second.\n   - They scored 24 points.\n\n5. **Calculate the Point Difference:**\n   - The difference in points between the first place (31 points) and the runner-up (24 points) is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     31 - 24 = 7\n     \\]\n\n6. **Interpret \"Small Point Difference\":**\n   - In a competitive event like Eurovision, a point difference of 7 can be considered small relative to the total points possible.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that there is only a small point difference between the first place winner and the runner-up. Given our calculation showing a 7-point difference, this qualifies as a relatively small gap in context.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the first place entry (Row 14) with 31 points and the second place entry (Row 15) with 24 points. Calculate the point difference: 31 - 24 = 7.
