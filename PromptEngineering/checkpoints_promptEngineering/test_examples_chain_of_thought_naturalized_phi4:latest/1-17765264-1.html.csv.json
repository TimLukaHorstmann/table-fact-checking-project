We should look at the \"result\" column as it indicates the outcome of each game.\n\n2. **Review the results for ties**:\n   - A tied game is indicated by \"t\".\n   \n3. **Examine each row for a tie result**:\n   - Row 1: Result is \"w 13 - 10\". (No tie)\n   - Row 2: Result is \"w 27 - 21\". (No tie)\n   - Row 3: Result is \"l 24 - 28\". (No tie)\n   - Row 4: Result is \"w 31 - 14\". (No tie)\n   - Row 5: Result is \"l 19 - 23\".
