    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Danish Thomas Bj\u00f8rn rank lower than Tiger Woods\" is true or false, we need to compare their placements based on the given table data.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Players:**\n   - We need to locate the rows for both Thomas Bj\u00f8rn and Tiger Woods from the table.\n   \n2. **Locate Thomas Bj\u00f8rn's Row:**\n   - From the table, Thomas Bj\u00f8rn is listed in Row 6 with a placement of \"t6\".\n   \n3. **Locate Tiger Woods' Row:**\n   - Similarly, Tiger Woods is listed in Row 9 with a placement of \"t6\".\n\n4. **Understand the Ranking Notation:**\n   - The notation \"tX\" indicates a tie for position X. Therefore, both Thomas Bj\u00f8rn and Tiger Woods are tied for the 6th place.\n\n5. **Compare Their Rankings:**\n   - Since both players have the same placement of \"t6\", neither ranks lower than the other. They share the same rank.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim that Danish Thomas Bj\u00f8rn ranks lower than Tiger Woods is false because they are tied for the 6th place.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- **Thomas Bj\u00f8rn's Data:**\n  - Row 6, \"place\": \"t6\"\n  - Row 6, \"player\": \"thomas bj\u00e3rn\"\n\n- **Tiger Woods' Data:**\n  - Row 9, \"place\": \"t6\"\n  - Row 9, \"player\": \"tiger woods\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the rows for Thomas Bj\u00f8rn and Tiger Woods.\",\n    \"Thomas Bj\u00f8rn is in Row 6 with a placement of 't6'.\",\n    \"Tiger Woods is in Row 9 with a placement of 't6'.\",\n    \"'t6' indicates both players are tied for 6th place.\",\n    \"Therefore, Thomas Bj\u00f8rn does not rank lower than Tiger Woods.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
