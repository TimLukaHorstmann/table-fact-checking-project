    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Black Ice was never released as an LP, only as a CD\" is true or false, we need to analyze the given table for any entries indicating the release of \"Black Ice\" on LP (Long Play) formats.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Format Information:**\n   - We are interested in finding if there are any releases listed as an \"LP,\" which stands for Long Play, a physical format distinct from a CD.\n   \n2. **Examine Each Row for LP Releases:**\n   - **Row 1:** The release is labeled with the formats \"CD\" and \"double LP.\"\n     - This indicates that \"Black Ice\" was released as an LP in Europe on 17 October 2008.\n   - **Row 3:** Similarly, this row also mentions the format as \"CD\" and \"double LP.\"\n     - Again, indicating a release as an LP in the United Kingdom on 20 October 2008.\n   \n3. **Check Other Rows for Confirmation:**\n   - **Rows 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8:** These rows list only CD formats or digital downloads and do not mention LPs.\n   - None of these entries contradict the presence of LP releases found in rows 1 and 3.\n\n4. **Conclusion Based on Analysis:**\n   - Since \"Black Ice\" was released as an LP (or double LP) in both Europe and the United Kingdom, it is clear that the claim stating it was never released as an LP is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 1: \n  - Column \"format\": \"cd , double lp\"\n- Row 3:\n  - Column \"format\": \"cd , double lp\"\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that 'Black Ice' was never released as an LP, only as a CD.
