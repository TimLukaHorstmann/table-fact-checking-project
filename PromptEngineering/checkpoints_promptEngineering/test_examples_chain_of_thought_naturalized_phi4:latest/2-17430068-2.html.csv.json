According to the table:\n     - Row 8 corresponds to CF Tornados de Humacao.\n\n2. **Check Founding Year and Seasons in PRSL:**\n   - From Row 8, we gather the following details:\n     - Club: cf tornados de humacao\n     - Founded: 1994\n     - Seasons in PRSL: 2008, 2009\n\n3. **Analyze the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that CF Tornados de Humacao participated in the league for three consecutive seasons from 2008 to 2010.\n   - We need to check if the club participated in all three years (2008, 2009, and 2010).\n\n4. **Verify Participation for Each Year:**\n   - According to Row 8:\n     - The club was part of the league in 2008 and 2009.\n     - There is no mention of participation in 2010.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since CF Tornados de Humacao did not participate in the league during 2010, they were not present for three consecutive seasons from 2008 to 2010.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified Row 8 as corresponding to CF Tornados de Humacao.

This is before 1970.\n   - **Row 2:** Club: atl\u00e9tico de san juan fc, founded in 2008. This is not before 1970.\n   - **Row 3:** Club: bayam\u00f3n fc, founded in 2009.
