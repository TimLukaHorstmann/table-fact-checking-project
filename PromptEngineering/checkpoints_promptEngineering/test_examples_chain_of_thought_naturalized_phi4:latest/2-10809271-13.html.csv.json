    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"prince park be home to the carlton team\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant information provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - We are looking for a match where Carlton is the home team.\n   - We need to check if Prince Park is listed as the venue when Carlton is the home team.\n\n2. **Locate Carlton Matches:**\n   - Check each row in the table to find instances where Carlton is mentioned as the home team.\n   - Row 3 lists \"home team: carlton\" with \"venue: princes park\".\n\n3. **Verify Venue for Carlton:**\n   - In Row 3, we see that when Carlton is the home team, the venue is listed as \"princes park\".\n   - The claim mentions \"prince park\", which is a common variation of spelling \"Princes Park\". Considering this minor difference in spelling does not change the actual location being referred to.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Row 3 confirms that Carlton's home match was at Princes Park, the claim \"prince park be home to the carlton team\" is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- From Row 3:\n  - Column \"home team\": \"carlton\"\n  - Column \"venue\": \"princes park\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify where Carlton is listed as the home team. In Row 3, Carlton is the home team and the venue is Princes Park. The claim's reference to 'prince park' matches with 'Princes Park', considering common spelling variations.
