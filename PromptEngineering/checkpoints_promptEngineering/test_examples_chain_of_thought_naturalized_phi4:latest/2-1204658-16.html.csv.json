    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"no team scored more than 120 points in a game\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze each row of the table and focus on the scores for both home and away teams. The key information to look at is the \"home team score\" and \"away team score\" columns.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Scoring System**: \n   - The scoring system in the table is given as \"goal+behind\". In Australian rules football, a goal is worth 6 points and a behind is worth 1 point.\n   - To calculate the total score, multiply the number of goals by 6 and add the number of behinds.\n\n2. **Evaluate Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: \n     - Home team (Fitzroy) scored 13.16 (94). Calculation: \\(13 \\times 6 + 16 = 78 + 16 = 94\\).\n     - Away team (University) scored 11.7 (73). Calculation: \\(11 \\times 6 + 7 = 66 + 7 = 73\\).\n\n   - **Row 2**: \n     - Home team (Essendon) scored 17.17 (119). Calculation: \\(17 \\times 6 + 17 = 102 + 17 = 119\\).\n     - Away team (Melbourne) scored 8.11 (59). Calculation: \\(8 \\times 6 + 11 = 48 + 11 = 59\\).\n\n   - **Row 3**: \n     - Home team (Collingwood) scored 10.10 (70). Calculation: \\(10 \\times 6 + 10 = 60 + 10 = 70\\).\n     - Away team (St Kilda) scored 7.9 (51). Calculation: \\(7 \\times 6 + 9 = 42 + 9 = 51\\).\n\n   - **Row 4**: \n     - Home team (South Melbourne) scored 18.12 (120). Calculation: \\(18 \\times 6 + 12 = 108 + 12 = 120\\).\n     - Away team (Richmond) scored 4.4 (28). Calculation: \\(4 \\times 6 + 4 = 24 + 4 = 28\\).\n\n   - **Row 5**: \n     - Home team (Geelong) scored 5.9 (39). Calculation: \\(5 \\times 6 + 9 = 30 + 9 = 39\\).\n     - Away team (Carlton) scored 6.13 (49). Calculation: \\(6 \\times 6 + 13 = 36 + 13 = 49\\).\n\n3. **Determine if Any Team Scored More Than 120**:\n   - From the calculations above, we see that in Row 4, the home team (South Melbourne) scored exactly 120 points.\n   - No team scored more than 120 points.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim \"no team scored more than 120 points in a game\" is TRUE because no team exceeded 120 points; the highest score was exactly 120 by South Melbourne.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We calculated the total scores for each team in all rows using the goal+behind format.
