The key piece of information we are looking for in each row is whether the game was played in regular time or if it went into overtime.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Overtime Games:**\n   - An overtime game can be identified by the presence of \"(ot)\" next to the score.\n   \n2. **Examine Each Row:**\n   - **Row 1:** The score is \"3 - 6\". There is no mention of overtime, so this game was not in overtime.\n   - **Row 2:** The score is \"4 - 5 (ot)\". The presence of \"(ot)\" indicates that this game went into overtime.\n   - **Row 3:** The score is \"1 - 4\". There is no mention of overtime, so this game was not in overtime.\n   - **Row 4:** The score is \"1 - 4\". There is no mention of overtime, so this game was not in overtime.\n   - **Row 5:** The score is \"7 - 2\". There is no mention of overtime, so this game was not in overtime.\n   - **Row 6:** The score is \"3 - 5\". There is no mention of overtime, so this game was not in overtime.\n\n3. **Count the Overtime Games:**\n   - From the examination above, only Row 2 indicates an overtime game.\n   - Therefore, there is only 1 game that went into overtime out of the 6 games listed.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states \"only 1 of the 6 games go to overtime.\"\n   - Based on our analysis, this statement is true since exactly one game (Row 2) went into overtime.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is TRUE as only one game out of the six listed in the table went into overtime.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Examine each row for '(ot)' to identify overtime games.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the largest margin of victory was 5 - 3\" is true or false, we need to analyze the scores from each game listed in the table. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that the largest margin of victory was 5 goals to 3. This implies we are looking for a game where one team won by a difference of at least 2 goals, with the specific scores being either 5 - 3 or 3 - 5.\n\n2. **Examine Each Game**: We will look at each row in the table and calculate the margin of victory (the absolute difference between the home and visitor scores).\n\n   - **Row 1**: Score: 3 - 6\n     - Margin: |3 - 6| = 3\n\n   - **Row 2**: Score: 4 - 5 (OT)\n     - Margin: |4 - 5| = 1\n\n   - **Row 3**: Score: 1 - 4\n     - Margin: |1 - 4| = 3\n\n   - **Row 4**: Score: 1 - 4\n     - Margin: |1 - 4| = 3\n\n   - **Row 5**: Score: 7 - 2\n     - Margin: |7 - 2| = 5\n\n   - **Row 6**: Score: 3 - 5\n     - Margin: |3 - 5| = 2\n\n3. **Identify the Largest Margin of Victory**: From the calculations above, we see that:\n   - The largest margin is 5 goals (from Row 5 with a score of 7 - 2).\n\n4. **Check for a 5 - 3 Scoreline**: We need to determine if any game had a score of 5 - 3 or 3 - 5.\n   - None of the games have this exact scoreline.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The claim that \"the largest margin of victory was 5 - 3\" is false because:\n   - No game ended with a score of 5 - 3 or 3 - 5.\n   - The largest actual margin of victory was 5 goals (7 - 2).\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**: The relevant cells for determining the margins are all the \"score\" columns.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that the largest margin of victory was 5 - 3.
