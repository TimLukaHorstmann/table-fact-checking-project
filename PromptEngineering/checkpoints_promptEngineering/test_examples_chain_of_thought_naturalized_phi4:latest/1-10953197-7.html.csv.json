    "resp": "To determine if the claim that \"Robert J Metoyer directed the episode with the production code 2398204\" is true, we'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Column for Directors**: Find which column contains information about directors.\n2. **Identify the Column for Production Codes**: Locate the column where production codes are listed.\n3. **Locate Row with Production Code 2398204**: Search through the rows to find the one that includes the production code 2398204.\n4. **Check Director in the Identified Row**: Verify if the director of this row is Robert J Metoyer.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n1. From the table data, it appears that the \"director\" information is located under a column labeled with names such as \"Robert J metoyer,\" \"Anson williams,\" etc.\n2.
