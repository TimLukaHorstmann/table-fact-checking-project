Each row in the table corresponds to a specific episode, and the \"season\" column specifies which season that episode belongs to.\n\n2. **Locate Season 6 in the table**:\n   - According to Row 6: `episode: 222`, `season: 6`, this is the row corresponding to an episode in Season 6.\n   \n3. **Check the format for Season 6**:\n   - In Row 6, the \"format\" column has the value `q145`.\n   \n4. **Evaluate the claim**: \n   - The claim states that \"the format of season 6 be q145\". From our analysis in step 3, we see that indeed, the format for Season 6 is `q145`.\n\n5. **Conclude**:\n   - Since the format specified in the table for Season 6 matches the format mentioned in the claim, the claim is true.\n\nRelevant cells:\n- Row 6: \"season\" column with value 6\n- Row 6: \"format\" column with value q145\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row corresponding to Season 6.\",\n    \"Row 6 has season: 6.\",\n    \"Check the format for this row, which is q145.\",\n    \"The claim matches the table data; thus, it is true.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"season 6.0 have q245 as its format\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table for any entry related to season 6 and check the corresponding format.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - We are looking for information specifically about \"season 6\". According to the table, each row has a column named \"season\" which specifies the season number of the episode.\n   \n2. **Locate Season 6 in the Table:**\n   - From the given rows:\n     - Row 1: Season is 1\n     - Row 2: Season is 2\n     - Row 3: Season is 3\n     - Row 4: Season is 4\n     - Row 5: Season is 5\n     - **Row 6: Season is 6** (matches the season we are interested in)\n     - Rows 7 to 16 have seasons numbered from 7 to 16.\n\n3. **Check the Format for Season 6:**\n   - According to Row 6, which corresponds to \"season 6\", the format is listed as \"q145\".\n\n4. **Compare with Claimed Format (q245):**\n   - The claim states that season 6 has a format of \"q245\". However, from our examination of Row 6, we see that the actual format is \"q145\".\n   \n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the format for season 6 in the table is \"q145\" and not \"q245\", the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cell for determining this claim is located at Row 6, Column \"format\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the row corresponding to season 6.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"223 be the only episode number with q147 format\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Columns**: We are interested in two specific columns from the table: \"episode\" and \"format\". The claim involves checking if episode 223 has the unique format code \"q147\".\n\n2. **Locate Episode 223**:\n   - According to the table, Row 7 corresponds to episode number 223.\n\n3. **Check the Format for Episode 223**:\n   - In Row 7, we find that the format is \"q146\", not \"q147\". This means episode 223 does not have the format \"q147\".\n\n4. **Identify Any Episodes with Format q147**:\n   - We need to check all rows to see if any episodes are associated with the format \"q147\".\n   - In Row 9, we find that episode number 225 has the format \"q147\".\n\n5. **Determine Uniqueness of Format q147 for Episode 223**:\n   - Since episode 223 does not have the format \"q147\", and episode 225 does, episode 223 cannot be the only one with this format.\n   - Furthermore, since there is another episode (episode 225) that has the format \"q147\", it confirms that episode 223 is not uniquely associated with \"q147\".\n\nBased on these observations, the claim is FALSE.
