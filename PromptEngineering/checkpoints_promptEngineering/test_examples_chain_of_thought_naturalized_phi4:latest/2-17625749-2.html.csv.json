    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"Canton RFC gain the fourth-least points through 20 games\" is true, we need to compare the total points of all clubs listed in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Points Column:**\n   - The column for points is labeled as \"points.\"\n\n2. **Extract Points Data:**\n   - Extract the points for each club from the table:\n     - Pontyclun RFC: 86\n     - Cilfynydd RFC: 74\n     - Barry RFC: 63\n     - St Albans RFC: 55\n     - Deri RFC: 52\n     - Hirwaun RFC: 51\n     - Penygraig RFC: 43\n     - Cowbridge RFC: 37\n     - Old Penarthians RFC: 33\n     - Dinas Powys RFC: 19\n     - Canton RFC: 10\n\n3. **Sort Points in Ascending Order:**\n   - Arrange the clubs based on their points from least to most:\n     - Canton RFC: 10\n     - Dinas Powys RFC: 19\n     - Old Penarthians RFC: 33\n     - Cowbridge RFC: 37\n     - Hirwaun RFC: 51\n     - Deri RFC: 52\n     - St Albans RFC: 55\n     - Barry RFC: 63\n     - Cilfynydd RFC: 74\n     - Pontyclun RFC: 86\n\n4. **Determine Fourth-Least Points:**\n   - The fourth-least points are associated with Cowbridge RFC, which has 37 points.\n\n5. **Check Canton RFC's Position:**\n   - Canton RFC has the least points (10), not the fourth-least.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim that \"Canton RFC gain the fourth-least point through 20 games\" is false because they have the least points, not the fourth-least.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the 'points' column and extracted the points for each club. Sorted the clubs by their points in ascending order to determine the ranking of points. Found that Canton RFC has the least points (10), while Cowbridge RFC has the fourth-least points (37). Therefore, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
