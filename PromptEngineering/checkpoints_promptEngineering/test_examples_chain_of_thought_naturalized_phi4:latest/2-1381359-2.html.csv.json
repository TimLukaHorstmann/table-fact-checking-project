Here are the steps to analyze it:\n\n1. **Identify the Season**: The claim mentions \"season 2000 - 1\". We will locate this specific season within the table.\n\n2. **Check for Title Number**: According to the claim, during this season, the event title is the \"37th\". We need to confirm that in row corresponding to the season 2000-01, the title number matches this detail.\n\n3. **Verify the Winner**: The claim states that \"kanto gakuin university\" was the winner for this season. We will check if kanto gakuin university is listed as the winner in the same row where we identified the season 2000 - 1 and title as 37th.\n\n4. **Attendance Availability**: Finally, the claim mentions that attendance information \"be not available\". We need to confirm that the attendance value for this specific event is marked as \"n/a\".\n\nLet's go through these steps with reference to each row in the table:\n\n- **Row Identification**: The season 2000 - 1 is listed explicitly in Row 8.\n  \n- **Title Verification**: In Row 8, the title is indeed labeled as \"37th\", which matches what is claimed.\n\n- **Winner Confirmation**: According to Row 8, the winner for this event was \"kanto gakuin university\", confirming that part of the claim.\n\n- **Attendance Check**: The attendance column in Row 8 is marked as \"n/a\", indicating that no specific attendance figure is available, which matches the claim's assertion about attendance being unavailable.\n\nBy cross-referencing all these details with the specified row from the table, we can conclude that every part of the claim corresponds accurately to the data given.

This can be confirmed by checking each row until we find a match with the season information.\n\n2. **Check if the title for this row is 47th:**\n   - In Row 18, under the column labeled \"title\", the value is \"47th\". This matches the claim that states the title should be the 47th for the season 2010-11.\n\n3. **Verify if Waseda was the runner-up in this row:**\n   - Still focusing on Row 18, we look at the \"runner - up\" column, which indicates \"waseda\". This matches the claim that Waseda was the runner-up.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth parts of the claim are verified:\n- The title for season 2010-11 is indeed the 47th.\n- The runner-up for this season was Waseda.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is TRUE.
