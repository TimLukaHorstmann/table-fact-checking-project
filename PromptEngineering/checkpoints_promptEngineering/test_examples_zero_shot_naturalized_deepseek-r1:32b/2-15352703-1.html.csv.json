    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"draft pick number 155 come from arizona university\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim separately: the draft pick number (155) and the college (arizona university). \n\nStarting with the draft pick number 155. I'll scan through the \"pick\" column in each row to find where it matches 155. Looking through the rows, Row 5 has a pick number of 155.\n\nNext, I need to check the college associated with this pick. In Row 5, the player is John Nies, and his college is listed as arizona. This seems to align with the claim since the college mentioned is indeed Arizona University.\n\nWait, let me double-check to ensure there are no other picks with number 155. Scanning through all rows, I don't see any other entries with pick number 155 except in Row 5. So, this row is the only relevant one for this claim.\n\nTherefore, since both the pick number and the college match the claim, it should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that draft pick number 155 comes from Arizona University. Checking the table:\n\n- Pick number 155 is found in Row 5 (round: 6).\n- The player is John Nies, who attended Arizona.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine if the claim \"arizona be the college who have the last draft pick\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that Arizona is the college associated with the last draft pick in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different round and pick number along with details about the player. The last row in the table is row 12, which has the highest pick number of 293. So, this would be the last draft pick as per the data given.\n\nNow, I need to check which college corresponds to that last pick. Scanning row 12, the player is Al Edwards, and his position is wide receiver from Northwestern State in Louisiana. Wait a minute\u2014that's not Arizona. Hmm, so that might indicate that the claim is false.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there are other picks where Arizona appears. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Row 3: Glenn Parker from Arizona, pick 70.\n- Row 5: John Nies from Arizona, pick 155.\n- Row 6: Brent Griffith from Minnesota-Duluth, not Arizona.\n- Row 12: Al Edwards from Northwestern State LA.\n\nSo Arizona appears in rows 3 and 5. The last pick is row 12, which isn't Arizona. Therefore, the claim that Arizona has the last draft pick is incorrect because the last pick is from Northwestern State LA, not Arizona.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Arizona has the last draft pick, but the last pick (row 12) is from Northwestern State LA, so the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
