The claim states: \"saracen player glen jackson and the harlequin chris malone both have 2 drop.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim to understand what needs verification.\n\n1. **Identifying Glen Jackson**: The claim mentions that Glen Jackson is a Saracens player. Looking at the table, row 4 has \"name: glen jackson\" and \"club: saracens.\" So, this part checks out.\n\n2. **Checking Drops for Glen Jackson**: The claim also says he has 2 drops.

Scanning through the table, I find Chris Malone in row 10 with \"club: harlequins.\" So that's correct.\n\n4. **Checking Drops for Chris Malone**: Now, checking the 'drop' column for Chris Malone in row 10 shows it's 2 as well.

Olly Barkley from Bath Rugby has 0 drops.\n2. Ryan Lamb has 1 drop.\n\nI'll check each part separately against the table.\n\nLooking at the table row by row:\n\n- Row 5: It mentions \"olly barkley\" from Bath Rugby with points 178, tries 3, and drop 0.

The claim is: \"Alberto di Bernardo of Leeds Carnegie have fewer drop than Glen Jackson of Saracen.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to in the context of the table provided. The table has multiple rows, each representing a different player with details like points, name, club, tries, and drops.\n\nThe key elements in the claim are:\n1. Alberto di Bernardo from Leeds Carnegie.\n2. Glen Jackson from Saracens.\n3. Comparing their 'drop' counts to see if Alberto has fewer drops than Glen.\n\nSo, my first step is to locate both players in the table. \n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- Row 7: points: 127, name: Alberto di Bernardo, club: Leeds Carnegie, tries: 0, drop: 5.\n- Row 4: points: 179, name: Glen Jackson, club: Saracens, tries: 2, drop: 2.\n\nFrom this, I can extract the relevant data:\n- Alberto di Bernardo has 5 drops.\n- Glen Jackson has 2 drops.\n\nThe claim states that Alberto has fewer drops than Glen. However, according to the table, Alberto has more drops (5) compared to Glen's 2. Therefore, the statement is incorrect because 5 is not fewer than 2; it's actually more.\n\nTo verify this accurately, I need to ensure I'm looking at the correct rows and columns. For Alberto di Bernardo, that's row 7 with a 'drop' value of 5. For Glen Jackson, it's row 4 with a 'drop' value of 2. \n\nComparing these two values clearly shows that the claim is false because Alberto has more drops than Glen.\n</think>\n\nThe claim compares the number of drops between Alberto di Bernardo and Glen Jackson.

So according to the table, Shane scored more points (118) compared to Chris who has 107. \n\nThe claim says Shane scores fewer points, but that's not correct based on these numbers. Therefore, the statement is FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells in the table to verify this. For each player, I look at their row and the 'points' column. So, for Shane Drahm, it's Row 8, 'points'. For Chris Malone, it's Row 10, 'points'.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Row 8, points: 118\n- Row 10, points: 107\n\nSince 118 is more than 107, Shane actually scored more.

The phrase \"neither... nor...\" suggests that all three individuals mentioned should not have less than 2 tries. In other words, each of them should have at least 2 tries. So, if any of them has fewer than 2 tries, the claim would be false.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the rows corresponding to these three players and check their 'tries' column.\n\n1. **Charlie Hodgson**: From row 2, his tries are listed as 0.\n2. **Adrian Jarvis**: He's in row 9, with tries also showing 0.\n3. **Alberto di Bernardo**: Row 7 shows he has 0 tries.\n\nEach of these players has 0 tries, which is less than 2.

I need to determine whether the claim \"bath rugby's olly barkley have more drop than ryan lamb\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each part of the claim refers to. The claim compares two players: Olly Barkley from Bath Rugby and Ryan Lamb. Specifically, it's comparing their 'drop' values. So, my goal is to find out how many drops each of them has and see if Olly Barkley indeed has more drops than Ryan Lamb.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through each row to locate these two players. \n\nRow 5 mentions \"olly barkley\" with a club listed as \"bath rugby\". Under the 'drop' column for this row, it says 0. So, Olly Barkley has 0 drops.\n\nNext, I need to find Ryan Lamb. Scanning through the rows, Row 6 lists \"ryan lamb\" from Gloucester Rugby, and his 'drop' value is 1.\n\nNow, comparing their drop counts: Olly Barkley has 0 drops, while Ryan Lamb has 1 drop. The claim states that Olly Barkley has more drops than Ryan Lamb. However, 0 is not more than 1; in fact, it's less. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nTo support this conclusion, I'll identify which cells from the table were relevant. For Olly Barkley, I looked at Row 5 under the 'drop' column. For Ryan Lamb, it was Row 6 under the same 'drop' column. These are the key pieces of information needed to verify the claim.\n\nSo, putting it all together: since Olly Barkley's drop count (0) is not greater than Ryan Lamb's (1), the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are the 'drop' entries for both players.\n</think>\n\nThe claim compares the number of drops between two players.
