    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"at least 5 of the player list be play for the united state\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It's stating that there should be five or more players from the United States in the player list.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different player with their details. I'll go through each row and check the 'country' column to see how many players are from the United States.\n\nRow 1: Greg Norman is from Australia.\nRow 2: Nick Faldo is from England.\nRow 3: David Frost is from South Africa.\nRow 4: Phil Mickelson is from the United States. That's one.\nRow 5: Lee Janzen is from the United States. Two.\nRow 6: Bob Tway is also from the United States. Three.\nRow 7: Scott Hoch, another US player. Four.\nRow 8: Scott McCarron is from the United States. Five.\nRow 9: Vijay Singh is from Fiji.\nRows 10 and 11: Corey Pavin and Ian Woosnam are from the United States as well, but they're tied at t10.\n\nWait, I should count all players, not just unique individuals. Let me recount:\n\nPlayers from the US:\n- Phil Mickelson (Row4)\n- Lee Janzen (Row5)\n- Bob Tway (Row6)\n- Scott Hoch (Row7)\n- Scott McCarron (Row8)\n- Corey Pavin (Row10)\n- Ian Woosnam is actually from Wales, so he's not in the US.\n\nWait, that's a mistake. Row 11: Ian Woosnam is from Wales, not the US. So I shouldn't count him. Let me recount correctly:\n\nUS players are:\n- Phil Mickelson (Row4)\n- Lee Janzen (Row5)\n- Bob Tway (Row6)\n- Scott Hoch (Row7)\n- Scott McCarron (Row8)\n- Corey Pavin (Row10)\n\nThat's six US players. So the claim is TRUE because there are at least five.\n\nNow, I need to note which cells are relevant. The 'country' column in each row where the country is the United States.\n\nSo for rows 4,5,6,7,8, and 10, their 'country' cells indicate they're from the US. These are six players, so more than five, making the claim TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"nick faldo be the only player list who be play for england , while ian woosnam be play for wale.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. Nick Faldo is the only player from England.\n2. Ian Woosnam plays for Wales.\n\nI should check each part against the table to see if they hold true.\n\nStarting with the first part: Is Nick Faldo the only player representing England? Looking at the table, I'll scan through the \"country\" column of each row.\n\nRow 1: Greg Norman from Australia.\nRow 2: Nick Faldo from England. This is one instance.\nRows 3-8: Players from South Africa and United States.\nRow 9: Vijay Singh from Fiji.\nRows 10 and 11: Corey Pavin from the United States and Ian Woosnam from Wales.\n\nFrom this, I see that Nick Faldo is indeed the only player listed with England as his country. No other players are from England in the table. So the first part of the claim holds true.\n\nNext, checking the second part: Does Ian Woosnam play for Wales? Looking at row 11, yes, it says Ian Woosnam's country is Wales. That seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check to ensure there are no other players from England besides Nick Faldo and that Ian Woosnam is correctly associated with Wales. Going through each row again:\n\nRow 2: Nick Faldo - England.\nRows after that don't list any other English players. The only other British national listed is Ian Woosnam from Wales in row 11.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are accurate based on the table provided.

The claim in question is: \"greg norman be list to have be play for australia, and have - 12 stroke to par.\" \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the table provided. It has several rows, each representing a player's performance with details like place, player name, country, score, and to par. The claim mentions Greg Norman playing for Australia and having a -12 stroke to par. So, I need to check if these two pieces of information are accurate according to the table.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Place is 1, Player is Greg Norman, Country is Australia, Score is 63 + 69 = 132, To Par is -12. That seems to align with the claim.\n\nNow, breaking down the claim into two parts:\n1. Greg Norman plays for Australia.\n2.

David Frost is the only player from South Africa.\n2. Vijay Singh plays for Fiji.\n\nI'll check each part against the table row by row.\n\nLooking at Row 3: It says David Frost is from South Africa. So that's one player from SA.\n\nNow, I need to make sure no other players are listed as being from South Africa. Let me scan through all rows:\n- Row 1: Greg Norman - Australia\n- Row 2: Nick Faldo - England\n- Row 3: David Frost - South Africa\n- Row 4: Phil Mickelson - USA\n- Row 5 and 6: Lee Janzen, Bob Tway - both USA\n- Row 7 and 8: Scott Hoch, Scott McCarron - USA\n- Row 9: Vijay Singh - Fiji\n- Rows 10 and 11: Corey Pavin, Ian Woosnam - USA and Wales respectively.\n\nSo yes, only David Frost is from South Africa.

Row 6 has \"player: bob tway, country: united states.\" So Bob is from the US, not England.\n\nWait, but the claim says he's the only one playing for England. But in the table, Nick Faldo is from England (Row 2). So that means there are players from England besides Bob Tway? Wait no, actually, looking again:\n\n- Row 2: Nick Faldo, country: england.\n\nSo if the claim says Bob Tway is the only one for England, but the table shows Nick as the player from England. Therefore, Bob isn't playing for England at all; instead, he's from the US.
