    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the wildcat keep the oppose team scoreless in 4 game\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that the Wildcats kept their opponents from scoring any points in four different games. In other words, there should be four rows where the opponent's score is zero.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, opponent, result, Wildcat points, opponent points, and record. The key column here is \"opponents,\" which shows how many points the opposing team scored in each game.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to check if the opponent's score was zero:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Opponents scored 14 points. Not zero.\n2. **Row 2**: Opponents scored 0 points. That's one.\n3. **Row 3**: Opponents scored 7 points. Not zero.\n4. **Row 4**: Opponents scored 0 points. That's two.\n5. **Row 5**: Opponents scored 0 points. That's three.\n6. **Row 6**: Opponents scored 6 points. Not zero.\n7. **Row 7**: Opponents scored 13 points. Not zero.\n8. **Row 8**: Opponents scored 6 points. Not zero.\n9. **Row 9**: Opponents scored 0 points. That's four.\n10. **Row 10**: Opponents scored 13 points. Not zero.\n\nSo, from this check, the opponents had zero points in games 2, 4, 5, and 9. That makes four games where the Wildcats kept their opponents scoreless. \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there are indeed four instances where the opposing team scored zero points.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the wildcat never score more than 7 in any game they lose\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. There are ten rows, each representing a different game. Each row has columns: game number, date, opponent, result, wildcats points, opponents' points, and record.\n\nThe claim is about games where the Wildcats lost (result = 'loss') and whether in those losses, their score never exceeded 7 points. So I need to check each row where the result is a loss and see if their points are more than 7.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Result is loss, wildcats points are 7. This meets the condition since 7 is not more than 7.\n\nNext, Row 7: Another loss with wildcats points 0. That's definitely less than 7.\n\nRow 10: Another loss, wildcats scored 6 points. Again, that's below 7.\n\nWait a minute, did I miss any other losses? Let me double-check all rows:\n\n- Game 1: loss, 7 points.\n- Games 2-6 and 8-9 are wins, so no need to check those.\n- Game 7: loss, 0 points.\n- Game 10: loss, 6 points.\n\nSo in all the games where they lost (three instances), their scores were 7, 0, and 6. None of these exceed 7. Therefore, the claim holds true because in every losing game, the Wildcats scored at most 7 points.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to list each cell that was checked. That includes the result column and wildcats points for rows where the result is a loss.\n\nSo for Row 1: both 'result' and 'wildcats points'.\nRow 7: same two columns.\nRow 10: same as above.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are in rows 1, 7, and 10, specifically looking at the 'result' and 'wildcats points' columns in each of those rows.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the wildcat lose 1 game in september and 2 game in november",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the wildcat lose 1 game in september and 2 games in november\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. Each row represents a game with details like the date, opponent, result, points for Wildcats, opponents' points, and the record after that game.\n\nThe claim mentions two parts: losing 1 game in September and losing 2 games in November. I'll tackle each part separately.\n\nStarting with September losses. Looking at the table rows:\n\n- Row 1: Date is Sept 20. Result is a loss.\n- Rows 2,3,4,5 are all in October or later, so no impact on September results.\n- Are there any other games in September? It seems only one game on Sept 20. So that's the only loss in September.\n\nNow for November losses. Checking each row with a date in November:\n\n- Row 7: Nov 1. Result is a loss.\n- Row 8: Nov 8. Result is a win, so not relevant.\n- Row 9: Nov 15. Result is a win.\n- Row 10: Nov 22. Result is a loss.\n\nSo in November, the Wildcats lost two games (Rows 7 and 10) and won one (Row 8). \n\nPutting it together: September has 1 loss, November has 2 losses. The claim states exactly that, so the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\nFor the September loss:\n- Row 1, column \"result\": indicates a loss.\n- Also, since only one game in September, the record after that game is 0-1 (Row 1, column \"record\").\n\nWait, actually, for verifying losses, I just need to check the result column. So for each relevant row:\n\n- Row 1: result is loss (september)\n- Rows 7 and 10: results are loss in November.\n\nBut according to instructions, we only need to highlight the cells that support the claim. Since the claim is about losses in September (1) and November (2), I should list all relevant cells for each loss:\n\nFor September:\n- Row 1, \"result\"\n\nFor November:\n- Row 7, \"result\"\n- Row 10, \"result\"\n\nAdditionally, perhaps including their respective dates to confirm the months.\n\nWait, but instructions say to check each condition. So maybe I need to list all rows that are in September and have a loss result, and similarly for November.\n\nBut let me re-read the instructions: it says \"check each condition\" against the table. So for the first part, 1 loss in September:\n\nLooking at all games in September (only Row 1), which is a loss. Then, two losses in November: Rows 7 and 10 are losses in Nov.\n\nSo the relevant cells are rows 1,7,10 with \"result\" column.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps their dates to confirm the months:\n\n- For Sept loss: row 1, date (sept 20)\n- For November losses: row7, date (nov1); row10, date (nov22)\n\nBut maybe I can stick to just checking the result and game dates. Alternatively, since the question is about the number of losses in each month, perhaps it's sufficient to check all games in those months.\n\nSo, for September:\n\n- Row 1: date sept 20, result loss.\n\nFor November:\n\n- Rows 7 (nov1), 8(nov8),9(nov15),10(nov22)\n\nCheck each of these rows' results. The losses are in Rows7 and 10.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Row 1: \"date\" and \"result\"\n- Rows7 and 10: \"date\" and \"result\"\n\nBut perhaps according to instructions, just list the necessary cells that support the claim.\n\nAlternatively, focusing on the result column for each row in September and November.\n\nSo:\n\nFor September loss:\n- Row1, result\n\nFor November losses:\n- Row7, result\n- Row10, result\n\nThat's three cells. Are there any other rows to consider? Let me check all rows again:\n\nRows 1: sept20 - loss (september)\nRow2: sept27 is still september? Wait, the date in row2 is Sept 27, which is also September.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Row2's date is Sept 27, which is still in September. So that adds another game in September.\n\nBut according to the table:\n\nRow1: sept20 - loss\nRow2: sept27 - result: win\n\nSo there are two games in September: one loss and one win.\n\nWait, this changes things because initially I thought only Row1 was in September. But actually, Row2 is also in September.\n\nSo total September games:\n\n- Row1: Sept 20, loss\n- Row2: Sept27, win\n\nThus, in September, the Wildcats lost once and won once. So the first part of the claim (lose 1 game in September) holds true because they did lose one game (Row1). The second part is about November losses.\n\nBut now I need to check if the initial assessment was correct or not. Since Row2 is also in September, there are two games: one loss and one win.\n\nSo for the claim \"lose 1 game in september\", it's true because only Row1 was a loss.\n\nWait, but let me clarify: the claim says they lost 1 game in September. There are two games in September (Rows1 and2). One loss, one win. So that part is correct.\n\nThen, for November:\n\nRows7,8,9,10 are in November.\n\nResults:\n\n- Row7: loss\n- Row8: win\n- Row9: win\n- Row10: loss\n\nSo two losses (Rows7 and10) and two wins. So the claim's second part is correct as well.\n\nThus, overall, the answer is TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells:\n\nTo support that there was 1 loss in September, need to show that among the September games (Rows1 and2), only one resulted in a loss.\n\nSo check Row1 and Row2's results. So cells would be:\n\n- Row1: result\n- Row2: result\n\nSimilarly, for November losses, check Rows7,8,9,10:\n\n- Rows7,10 have \"result\" as loss.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\nFrom September:\nRow1.result and Row2.result\n\nFrom November:\nRows7.result and 10.result\n\nBut according to instructions, do I need to include all rows in the month to check counts? Or just the ones that are losses?\n\nThe question is about how many losses occurred each month. So to confirm one loss in September, you can look at both games:\n\n- In Row1: loss\n- In Row2: win\n\nSo for September, count 1 loss.\n\nSimilarly, in November:\n\n- Row7: loss\n- Row8: win\n- Row9: win\n- Row10:loss\n\nThus, two losses.\n\nTherefore, to support the claim, we need to include all relevant games in those months. So listing the results of each September and November game would be appropriate.\n\nBut maybe the answer expects just the cells where the loss occurred, since the question is about counts of losses.\n\nBut I think perhaps for thoroughness, it's better to list all rows in the respective months with their result columns.\n\nAlternatively, to keep it concise, only list the rows that contributed to the losses. But given that there are two games in September and four in November, but only some resulted in losses, perhaps just listing those with loss results is sufficient.\n\nThus:\n\n- Row1.result (loss)\n- Rows7.result and 10.result (both losses)\n\nSo three cells.\n\nBut to be precise, since the question requires verifying that exactly one game was lost in September and two in November, I think including all games in each month would be more accurate. So for September, both rows' results are relevant, same with November's four rows.\n\nBut perhaps the initial answer just lists the loss cells as those are the ones supporting the counts.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is that the Wildcats lost 1 game in September and 2 games in November. To verify this:\n\n- **September**: Check all games in September (Rows 1 and 2). Row 1 resulted in a loss, while Row 2 was a win. Thus, 1 loss.\n\n- **November**: Check all November games (Rows 7, 8, 9, 10). Rows 7 and 10 were losses, so 2 losses.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct.\n\n**Relevant cells:**\n\n- Row1.result\n- Row2.result\n- Row7.result\n- Row8.result\n- Row9.result\n- Row10.result\n\nHowever, focusing on the loss results specifically:\n\n- Row1.result (loss)\n- Row7.result (loss)\n- Row10.result (loss)\n\nBut to accurately count, we should consider all games in each month. However, for brevity, highlighting only the losses may suffice.\n\nFinal answer: TRUE\n\n**Relevant cells identified:** The result column of Rows 1, 7, and 10.\n\nThus:\n\nThe claim is true, as the Wildcats lost one game in September (Row 1) and two games in November (Rows 7 and 10).\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{True}}$",

The claim also says 4, which is correct.\n\nWait, but looking back at the rows:\n\n- September has Game 1 and 2: 2 games.\n- October has Games 3 to 6: that's 4 games (Games 3,4,5,6).\n- November has Games 7 to 10: that's 4 games (7,8,9,10).\n\nSo the counts are accurate.

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that the maximum points by which the Wildcats outscored their opponents in a single game was 36 points.\n\nFirst, I should check each row of the table to find instances where the Wildcats won and calculate the point difference for those games. The relevant columns here are \"wildcats points\" and \"opponents\". \n\nLooking at Row 1: It's a loss, so that doesn't matter. Moving on to Row 2: They won with 20 points against Cincinnati who scored 0. That's a 20-point difference. Next, Row 3 is another win, Wildcats scored 20, opponents 7, so a 13-point difference.\n\nRow 4 shows a win with 26 points against Georgia (opponent) who scored 0, which gives a 26-point difference. Then in Row 5, they won with 14 points and the opponent also scored 0, making it a 14-point margin. \n\nLooking at Row 6: Wildcats scored 7, opponents 6, so that's only a 1-point win. Moving to Row 7 is a loss, so I can skip that. In Row 8, they won with 15 points against West Virginia's 6, which is a 9-point difference.\n\nRow 9 catches my attention because the Wildcats scored 36 points and the opponent scored 0. That means the point difference here is 36-0=36 points. This seems to be the highest in the table so far. \n\nFinally, Row 10 is another loss, so it doesn't apply.\n\nSo, going through all the rows, the maximum point difference where the Wildcats outscored their opponents was indeed 36 points in Row 9. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the wildcat keep the oppose team scoreless in 10 game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that the Wildcats kept their opponents' scores at zero points in all 10 games. So I need to check each game in the table and see if every opponent scored zero points.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 10 rows, each representing a different game. Each row has columns like \"game\", \"date\", \"opponent\", \"result\", \"wildcats points\", \"opponents\", and \"record\". The relevant column here is \"opponents\" which shows how many points the opposing team scored in each game.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Opponent score is 14. That's not zero, so this already contradicts the claim.\n2. **Row 2**: Opponent score is 0. Good.\n3. **Row 3**: Opponent score is 7. Not zero, another contradiction.\n4. **Row 4**: Opponent score is 0. Okay.\n5. **Row 5**: Opponent score is 0. Still good.\n6. **Row 6**: Opponent score is 6. That's not zero.\n7. **Row 7**: Opponent score is 13. Not zero.\n8. **Row 8**: Opponent score is 6. Again, not zero.\n9. **Row 9**: Opponent score is 0. Fine.\n10. **Row 10**: Opponent score is 13. Not zero.\n\nWait a minute, the claim mentions \"10 game\", which probably means all games up to that point. But looking at the table, there are only 10 rows (games), and in some of them, opponents scored more than zero. For example:\n\n- Game 1: Opponent scored 14.\n- Game 3: 7 points.\n- Game 6: 6 points.\n- Game 7: 13 points.\n- Game 8: 6 points.\n- Game 10: 13 points.\n\nSo the claim is definitely not true because in multiple games, the opposing teams scored points. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. The claim says \"keep the oppose team scoreless in 10 game\". If it's about all 10 games, then any game where opponents scored would make the claim false. Since there are multiple such instances, the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Wildcats kept their opponents' scores at zero in all 10 games. However, examining each row shows that several games had non-zero opponent scores. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE  \n**Relevant Cells:** All rows where \"opponents\" have a value greater than zero.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the wildcat never score more than 7 points in any game they win\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll need to understand the structure of the table. Each row represents a game with details like game number, date, opponent, result, points scored by Wildcats, opponents' points, and the team's record after that game.\n\nThe claim states that in every game they won, the Wildcats didn't score more than 7 points. To verify this, I need to look at all rows where the result is a win and check the corresponding \"wildcats points\" column.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- **Row 1**: Result is a loss. Not relevant.\n- **Row 2**: Result is a win. Wildcats scored 20 points. This already exceeds 7, so the claim might be false here.\n- **Row 3**: Win with 20 points. Again, more than 7.\n- **Row 4**: Win with 26 points. Far above 7.\n- **Row 5**: Win with 14 points. Still higher than 7.\n- **Row 6**: Win with 7 points. This is exactly the threshold.\n- **Row 7**: Loss, so irrelevant.\n- **Row 8**: Win with 15 points. Exceeds 7.\n- **Row 9**: Win with 36 points. Way above.\n- **Row 10**: Loss, not relevant.\n\nFrom this analysis, multiple games where the Wildcats won had scores much higher than 7. For instance, in Row 2 and Row 3, they scored 20 each, which is way more than 7. This indicates that the claim is not true because there are instances where they won with scores exceeding 7 points.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells are all the \"wildcats points\" from rows where the result was a win.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n     {\"row_2\": 20},\n     {\"row_3\": 20},\n     {\"row_4\": 26},\n     {\"row_5\": 14},\n     {\"row_6\": 7},\n     {\"row_8\": 15},\n     {\"row_9\": 36}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the wildcat loss 1 game in november and 2 game in september.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at September games. Looking through the rows, September has two games. Row 1 is on sept 20 against ole miss with a result of loss. That's one loss in September. Then row 2 is sept 27 against cincinnati and it's a win. So only one loss in September.\n\nNext, checking November. The claim says they lost 1 game in November. Let me go through the November games. Row 7 is nov 1 vs alabama with a loss. That's one loss. Then row 8 is a win on nov 8 against west virginia, and row 9 is a win on nov 15 against evansville. Wait, but row 10 is nov 22 against tennessee and it's also a loss. Oh, so actually there are two losses in November: one in row 7 and another in row 10.\n\nWait, the claim says only one loss in November, but according to the table, they lost twice in November. So that part is incorrect. Also, September only had one loss, not two as the claim suggests. Therefore, the overall statement isn't accurate because both parts are wrong: September had one loss and November had two losses.\n\nSo putting it all together, the relevant cells would include the games where they lost in September and November. That's row 1 (September loss) and rows 7 and 10 for November losses. The claim incorrectly states the number of losses in both months.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the Wildcats only lost once in September but twice in November.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine whether the claim \"the wildcat play 4 game in september , 2 game in october , and 2 game in november\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim:\n\n1. **September Games**: The claim states that there are 4 games in September.\n   - Checking the table, the dates for games are given as \"sept 20\" (Row 1) and \"sept 27\" (Row 2). That's only two games in September.\n\n2. **October Games**: The claim mentions 2 games in October.\n   - Looking at the rows, I see games on \"oct 4\" (Row 3), \"oct 11\" (Row 4), \"oct 18\" (Row 5), and \"oct 25\" (Row 6). That's four games in October.\n\n3. **November Games**: The claim says there are 2 games in November.\n   - From the table, games on \"nov 1\" (Row 7), \"nov 8\" (Row 8), \"nov 15\" (Row 9), and \"nov 22\" (Row 10) are listed.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the most the wildcat outscore an opponent be by 26 point\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that the Wildcats scored 26 points more than their opponent in a game. So, my goal is to check each row of the table to see if there's any instance where the Wildcats outscored their opponents by exactly 26 points.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a game with several columns: game number, date, opponent, result, Wildcats' points, opponents' points, and record. The key columns here are \"wildcats points\" and \"opponents\", as they will help me determine the point difference in each game.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Wildcats scored 7, Opponent scored 14. Difference is -7 (Wildcats lost).\n2. **Row 2**: Wildcats scored 20, Opponent scored 0. Difference is +20.\n3. **Row 3**: Wildcats scored 20, Opponent scored 7. Difference is +13.\n4. **Row 4**: Wildcats scored 26, Opponent scored 0. Difference is +26.\n5. **Row 5**: Wildcats scored 14, Opponent scored 0. Difference is +14.\n6. **Row 6**: Wildcats scored 7, Opponent scored 6. Difference is +1.\n7. **Row 7**: Wildcats scored 0, Opponent scored 13. Difference is -13 (Wildcats lost).\n8. **Row 8**: Wildcats scored 15, Opponent scored 6. Difference is +9.\n9. **Row 9**: Wildcats scored 36, Opponent scored 0. Difference is +36.\n10. **Row 10**: Wildcats scored 6, Opponent scored 13. Difference is -7 (Wildcats lost).\n\nFrom this analysis, I can see that in Row 4, the Wildcats outscored their opponent by 26 points. However, in Row 9, they actually outscored by a larger margin of 36 points. This means that while there is a game where they scored 26 points more, it's not the highest difference. Therefore, the claim states that the most was 26 points, but this isn't accurate because they had a higher margin in another game.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are from Row 4 and Row 9. The claim is FALSE because the maximum outscore was actually 36 points.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
