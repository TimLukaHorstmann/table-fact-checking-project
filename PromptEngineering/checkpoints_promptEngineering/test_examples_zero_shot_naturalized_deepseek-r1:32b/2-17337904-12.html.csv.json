I need to determine whether the claim \"li be the name for both the duke of song and the marquis of wey\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table to understand its structure. The table has 15 rows, each representing a different state with details about their sovereigns. Each row includes columns like state, type, name, title, and royal house.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific titles: \"duke of song\" and \"marquis of wey\". So, I need to find the entries in the table for states Song and Wey, check their names and titles, and see if both are named Li.\n\nStarting with the state Song. Looking through the rows:\n\n- Row 13: state is Song, type is sovereign, name is Li, title is duke, royal house is \"-\". This matches the \"duke of song\" part of the claim since the name is indeed Li and the title is Duke.\n\nNext, checking for Wey:\n\n- Row 14: state is Wey, type is sovereign, name is Li, title is marquis, royal house is \"-\". This corresponds to the \"marquis of wey\" in the claim. The name here is also Li, and the title matches Marquis.\n\nSince both entries for Song and Wey have the name Li with their respective titles, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"li be the name for both the duke of song and the marquis of wey.\" By examining the table, I found that in row 13, the state Song has a sovereign named Li who is a Duke. In row 14, the state Wey also lists a sovereign named Li with the title Marquis. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"state\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"state\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

In other words, in the table, under the 'royal house' column for those states, there should either be a dash '-' or empty value.\n\nNext, I'll go through each state mentioned and check their corresponding rows in the table to see what's listed under 'royal house'.\n\n1. **State: cao** - Looking at row 2, the royal house is '-'. So that checks out as unavailable.\n2. **State: chen** - Row 3 shows the royal house as '-', which means it's unavailable too.\n3. **State: song** - Checking row 13, the royal house column has a dash '-'. So that's also unavailable.\n4. **State: wey** - In row 14, the royal house is '-'. That fits the claim.\n5. **State: yan** - Row 15 shows the royal house as '-', so it's unavailable.\n\nSince all five states mentioned in the claim have their royal houses marked as '-', which indicates unavailability, the claim holds true. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are those where each state's 'royal house' is checked.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the royal house is unavailable for several states.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"wu be not the duke of either chen or lu\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's asserting that Wu is not a Duke in either the state of Chen or Lu. So, my task is to check if there's any record in the table where 'wu' has the title of Duke for either of these states.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents information about a sovereign with details like state, name, title, and royal house. The relevant columns here are \"state\" and \"title\".\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to find entries where the name is 'wu'. Let's go through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: State cai, name wu, title marquis.\n- Row 9: State qi, name wu, title duke.\n\nWait, so there are two entries with the name 'wu'. The first one in state cai has a title of marquis, not duke. The second is in state qi and holds the title of Duke. But the claim is about Chen and Lu states.\n\nSo now I need to check if any of these 'wu's are associated with Chen or Lu as their state. Looking at Row 1: State cai isn't Chen or Lu. Row 9: State qi, again not Chen or Lu. So neither of these entries link Wu to Chen or Lu as a Duke.\n\nNext, I should also check if any other entries in states Chen or Lu have the name 'wu' and title 'Duke'. Let's look through the table for states Chen and Lu:\n\n- Row 3: state chen, type sovereign, name you, title duke.\n- Row 8: state lu, name shen, title duke.\n\nSo in both cases, the names are 'you' and 'shen', not 'wu'. Therefore, there's no instance where 'wu' is a Duke for Chen or Lu.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"wu be not the duke of either chen or lu\" holds true because Wu isn't associated with those states as a Duke. The relevant cells to check are where name is 'wu', so rows 1 and 9. Additionally, checking the titles in Chen (row3) and Lu (row8) to ensure their names aren't 'wu'.\n\nSo compiling the relevant cells:\n- Row 1: columns 'name' and 'title' to see if Wu is a Duke.\n- Row 9: same as above for state qi.\n- Rows 3 and 8: checking their titles and names to confirm no link with Wu.\n\nThis confirms that the claim is TRUE, as there's no such instance of Wu being a Duke in Chen or Lu.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"state\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states that the title 'viscount' is held exclusively by two individuals: Xiong Yan the Elder and Xiong Yong. That means no one else in the table should have this title, and these two should indeed be viscounts.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 15 rows, each representing a state with its sovereign details. I'll go through each row to check for the 'viscount' title and see who holds it.\n\nStarting from Row 1:\n- State: cai\n- Type: sovereign\n- Name: wu\n- Title: marquis\n- Royal house: ji\n\nThe title here is 'marquis', not 'viscount'. So, this row doesn't affect the claim.\n\nRow 2:\n- State: cao\n- Type: sovereign\n- Name: yi\n- Title: count\n- Royal house: -\n\nTitle is 'count', so no relevance to our claim.\n\nRow 3:\n- State: chen\n- Type: sovereign\n- Name: you\n- Title: duke\n- Royal house: -\n\nAgain, the title is 'duke'. Moving on.\n\nRow 4:\n- State: chu\n- Type: sovereign\n- Name: xiong yan the elder\n- Title: viscount\n- Royal house: mi\n\nHere we have a match. Xiong Yan the Elder has the title 'viscount'.\n\nRow 5:\n- State: chu\n- Type: sovereign\n- Name: xiong yong\n- Title: viscount\n- Royal house: mi\n\nAnother match. Xiong Yong also holds the 'viscount' title.\n\nNow, I need to ensure that these are the only two entries with this title. Let's continue checking the rest of the table.\n\nRow 6:\n- State: jin\n- Type: sovereign\n- Name: jing\n- Title: marquis\n- Royal house: ji\n\nTitle is 'marquis' here as well.\n\nRow 7:\n- State: jin\n- Type: sovereign\n- Name: xi\n- Title: marquis\n- Royal house: ji\n\nAgain, 'marquis'.\n\nRow 8:\n- State: lu\n- Type: sovereign\n- Name: shen\n- Title: duke\n- Royal house: ji\n\nTitle is 'duke', not relevant.\n\nRow 9:\n- State: qi\n- Type: sovereign\n- Name: wu\n- Title: duke\n- Royal house: jiang\n\nDuke again.\n\nRow 10:\n- State: qin\n- Type: sovereign\n- Name: marquis\n- Title: marquis\n- Royal house: ying\n\nTitle is 'marquis'.\n\nRow 11:\n- State: qin\n- Type: sovereign\n- Name: gongbo\n- Title: ruler\n- Royal house: ying\n\nHere, the title is 'ruler', so not a match.\n\nRow 12:\n- State: qin\n- Type: sovereign\n- Name: qin zhong\n- Title: ruler\n- Royal house: ying\n\nAnother 'ruler' title.

It seems a bit grammatically off, but from context, it's asserting that \"Li\" isn't exclusively the name for the Duke of Song and the Marquis of Wey. In other words, there are other individuals named Li who hold these titles in different states beyond just Song and Wey.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, each row represents a sovereign with details like state, type (sovereign), name, title, and royal house. My job is to check if there's any other occurrence of \"Li\" as a name for either a Duke or Marquis in states other than Song and Wey.\n\nLet me go through each relevant cell:\n\n- Row 13: State is Song, type sovereign, name Li, title duke, royal house -.\n- Row 14: State is Wey, type sovereign, name Li, title marquis, royal house -.\n\nI need to see if there are any other rows where the name is Li and the titles are either Duke or Marquis in different states.

Both are in Song (Duke) and Wey (Marquis). There's no other occurrence of Li in any other state with either title.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"Li is not the name for only the Duke of Song and the Marquis of Wey\" would be FALSE because there are no other instances. However, upon re-reading the claim, it says \"not only,\" which implies that Li might have more roles elsewhere. But in this table, we don't see any other Li with those titles.\n\nWait a minute\u2014maybe I misinterpreted the claim. The original claim is phrased as \"li be not the name for only the duke of song and the marquis of wey.\" So it's saying that Li isn't exclusively used for these two roles, meaning there should be more uses elsewhere.

Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"wu be the duke of both chen or lu\" is false because there are no entries where Wu holds the title of Duke in either Chen or Lu states.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"state\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"state\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"state\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the royal house be not ji for the state jin , which do not have either jing and xi\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into parts. The main points are:\n\n1. The royal house of state Jin is not Ji.\n2. State Jin does not have individuals named Jing and Xi.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for rows where the state is Jin.\n\nRow 6: State is Jin, Royal House is Ji.\nRow 7: State is Jin, Royal House is Ji.\n\nSo both relevant rows show that the royal house of Jin is Ji. This contradicts the first part of the claim which states it's not Ji. \n\nNext, checking if there are individuals named Jing and Xi in state Jin:\n\nRow 6 has name Jing.\nRow 7 has name Xi.\n\nThe claim says Jin does not have either Jing or Xi, but according to the table, both names are present. Therefore, this part of the claim is also incorrect.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are false based on the data, the overall answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to list the relevant cells:\n\n- For the royal house: Rows 6 and 7 under 'royal house'.\n- For the names Jing and Xi: Rows 6 and 7 under 'name'.\n\nSo the relevant cells are rows 6 and 7 for both columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
