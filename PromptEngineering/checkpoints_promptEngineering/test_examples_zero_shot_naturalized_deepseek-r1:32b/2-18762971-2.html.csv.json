    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to verify the claim made about the attendances of two matches in March and February 2001. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"the match on 7 march 2001 have an attendance of 20503, while the 1 on 21 february 2001 have 23266.\" Hmm, wait a second\u2014the wording here is a bit confusing. It mentions \"the 1 on 21 February,\" but I think that's supposed to refer to another match date, probably a typo. Maybe it meant the match on 21 February?\n\nLooking at the data provided, each row represents a different match with details like date, opponent, venue (home or away), and attendance. My task is to find the rows corresponding to March 7 and February 21.\n\nStarting with March 7: I'll scan through the list of rows until I reach that date. Let me go through them one by one. \n\nRow 36: Date is 7 March 2001, opponent Portsmouth, venue home, attendance 20503. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nNow for February 21: I'll search for that date. Looking further down, Row 33 has the date 21 February 2001, opponent Nottingham Forest, venue away, and attendance 23266. That's also exactly what the claim states.\n\nSo both attendances mentioned in the claim are correctly reported in the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the match with the highest attendance be against sheffield united.\" So I need to check if Sheffield United had a match with the highest attendance in the given data.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table and note down the attendance figures for matches against Sheffield United and see what's the highest attendance overall.\n\nLooking at row 40: It's a home match against Sheffield United on April 1st, 2001. The attendance is 38,433. That seems pretty high. Is that the highest in the table?\n\nLet me check all other rows to see if any have higher attendances. \n\nRow 46: Another match against Crewe Alexandra at home on May 6th, with an attendance of 28,007. That's lower than 38k.\n\nRow 45: Away against Norwich City, attendance is 21,241. No higher.\n\nContinuing through the rows:\n\nLooking for any other high attendances. For example, row 10 has an away match against Portsmouth with 20,503. That's less than 38k.\n\nRow 17: Home against Burnley on March 17th, attendance is 20,184\u2014still lower.\n\nRow 26: Away against West Bromwich Albion on March 10th, attendance is 18,662. Not higher.\n\nI think the highest attendance in the table is indeed at row 40 with 38,433 for Sheffield United. So the claim seems to be true because that match has the highest attendance listed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the match against Sheffield United had the highest attendance. Checking each row, the highest attendance of 38,433 is found in row 40 against Sheffield United.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 40, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So, I'm looking for rows in the table where the result is a draw with a scoreline of 0-0.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row and check the \"result\" column to see if it's 0-0. Let me start from the top:\n\nRow 1: Result is 1-3. Not zero-zero.\nRow 2: 0-0? Wait, looking at the data provided earlier, I think some rows have different results. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for any row where both scores are zero. So, in each game's result, if it's something like x-y, and both x and y are zero, then that's a game with no goals scored by either side.\n\nLet me scan through all the rows:\n\nRow 1: Result is \"0-3\" \u2192 Not zero-zero.\nWait, actually looking back at the data provided, each row has an opponent, date, result. For example, Row 1 (assuming row index starts from 0) might have a different result.\n\nWait no, in the initial data, each row after the first line describes a game with columns: Date, Opponent, Result, Attendance, Venue.\n\nBut in the table provided by the user, it's a bit unclear. Wait, let me check again:\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has Date, Opponent, Result, Attendance, Venue.\n\nWait, but when I look through all rows, I need to find instances where Result is 0-0.\n\nLet me go step by step:\n\nRow 1: March 7, 2001 - Portsmouth. Result is \"0-0\". So that's one game with no goals.\nRow 36: March 7, 2001 vs Portsmouth: Result is 0-0. That's one.\n\nThen looking further down:\n\nRow 45: April 28, 2001 vs Norwich City: Result is 0-1 \u2192 Not zero-zero.\nWait no, let me check all rows again carefully.\n\nLooking through each row for \"0-0\":\n\nRow 1 (if starting count from 0): Let's see:\n\nLooking at the data in order:\n\nRow 1: March 7, 2001 - Portsmouth. Result is \"0-0\". So that's one.\n\nAnother instance: Row 46? Wait no, let me check each result column:\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to list all rows where result is 0-0.\n\nLooking at the data provided earlier:\n\nRow 37 (March 10, 2001 vs West Bromwich Albion) has a result of 2-1. Not zero-zero.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check each row's result:\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: March 7, 2001 - Portsmouth. Result is \"0-0\". So that's one.\n\nAnother instance: Looking further down, perhaps another 0-0?\n\nLooking at Row 46 (May 6, 2001 vs Crewe Alexandra): result is 0-0. That's the second game.\n\nIs there a third one? Let me check all rows again:\n\nRow 37: March 10, 2001 - West Bromwich Albion, result 2-1 \u2192 no.\nRow 46: May 6, 2001 vs Crewe Alexandra, result 0-0 \u2192 yes.\n\nWait, that's two games. Is there a third?\n\nLet me check each row again:\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\n- March 7, 2001 - Portsmouth: 0-0 (Row 36)\n- May 6, 2001 - Crewe Alexandra: 0-0 (Row 46)\n\nWait, perhaps I missed another one. Let me check each row's result.\n\nLooking through the data:\n\nRow 37: March 10, 2001 vs West Bromwich Albion: 2-1 \u2192 no.\nRow 42: April 14, 2001 vs Crystal Palace: 4-1 \u2192 no.\nRow 46: May 6, 2001 vs Crewe Alexandra: 0-0.\n\nWait, only two instances where the result is 0-0. So the claim says three games with no goals scored by either side. But according to this, there are only two such games.

So my goal is to check if such a pair exists in the data.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like date, opponent, venue, result, and attendance. The key here is the \"date\" column because that tells me when each match took place.\n\nI'll start by listing out all the dates from the table to see the sequence of matches over time.

May 6, 2001\n\nWait, I think I missed some earlier dates. Let me correct that by starting from the beginning:\n\nLooking back at the table provided, here's a more accurate list of dates in order:\n\n- February 3, 2001 (Row 35)\n- February 10, 2001 (Row 36)\n- February 13, 2001 (Row 37)\n- February 21, 2001 (Row 38)\n- February 24, 2001 (Row 39)\n- March 3, 2001 (Row 40)\n- March 7, 2001 (Row 41)\n- March 10, 2001 (Row 42)\n- March 17, 2001 (Row 43)\n- March 24, 2001 (Row 44)\n- April 1, 2001 (Row 45)\n- April 7, 2001 (Row 46)\n- April 14, 2001 (Row 47)\n- April 16, 2001 (Row 48)\n- April 21, 2001 (Row 49)\n- April 28, 2001 (Row 50)\n- May 6, 2001 (Row 51)\n\nWait, actually, I think I might have miscounted the rows. Let me check again:\n\nThe table starts with Row 1 on February 3, 2001, and goes up to Row 46 on May 6, 2001.\n\nNow, I need to compute the number of days between each consecutive match date.\n\nLet's list all dates in order:\n\nRow 1: February 3, 2001\nRow 2: February 10, 2001 (difference from previous: 7 days)\nRow 3: February 13, 2001 (diff: 3 days)\nRow 4: February 21, 2001 (diff: 8 days)\nRow 5: February 24, 2001 (diff: 3 days)\nRow 6: March 3, 2001 (diff: 7 days)\nRow 7: March 7, 2001 (diff: 4 days)\nRow 8: March 10, 2001 (diff: 3 days)\nRow 9: March 17, 2001 (diff: 7 days)\nRow 10: March 24, 2001 (diff: 7 days)\nRow 11: April 1, 2001 (diff: 8 days)\nRow 12: April 7, 2001 (diff: 6 days)\nRow 13: April 14, 2001 (diff: 7 days)\nRow 14: April 16, 2001 (diff: 2 days)\nRow 15: April 21, 2001 (diff: 5 days)\nRow 16: April 28, 2001 (diff: 7 days)\nRow 17: May 6, 2001 (diff: 8 days)\n\nWait a minute, looking at Row 14 and Row 15:\n\nRow 14 is April 16, 2001\nRow 15 is April 21, 2001. The difference is 5 days.\n\nBut I think I might have missed an earlier pair. Let me check again carefully.\n\nLooking back:\n\nFrom Row 13: April 14 to Row 14: April 16 is a gap of 2 days.\n\nYes! So between April 14 and April 16, that's only two days apart. Therefore, the shortest time between consecutive matches in this table is indeed two days.\n\nSo the claim is true because there exists at least one instance where two matches were held just two days apart.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is **True**.

So this was a victory.\n\nNext, February 24, 2001. Scanning through the rows again, I find row index 35 with the date \"24 february 2001\". The opponent here is Gillingham, and the result is \"2 - 1\", which indicates another win for our team.\n\nSince both matches on April 14 and February 24, 2001, resulted in victories, the claim holds true. I'll need to note the relevant cells for each match. For April 14th, row index 42 includes 'Date', 'Opponent', and 'Result'.

Looking at the data:\n\n- For April 14, 2001 (Row 42), the result was a victory (4 - 1 against Crystal Palace).\n- For February 24, 2001 (Row 35), the result was also a victory (2 - 1 against Gillingham).\n\nThus, both matches were victories.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 42, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 42, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 42, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is that \"the shortest time between 2 consecutive matches in March be 2 days.\" So, I need to verify if there are two matches in March where the gap between them is just two days.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row of data provided, focusing on matches occurring in March. Let's list out all the matches that happened in March:\n\nLooking at the table, rows 34 and beyond have dates in February and March. Specifically, I'm looking for matches where the date falls within March 2001.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Row 35: Date is 3 March 2001\n- Row 36: Date is 7 March 2001\n- Row 37: Date is 10 March 2001\n- Row 38: Date is 17 March 2001\n- Row 39: Date is 24 March 2001\n- Row 40: Date is 1 April 2001 (which is after March)\n\nWait, row 40 is in April, so that's not part of March. So the relevant matches in March are rows 35 to 39.\n\nNow, I need to check the dates between these consecutive matches:\n\n- Between 3rd and 7th: That's a gap of 4 days.\n- Between 7th and 10th: That's 3 days.\n- Between 10th and 17th: That's 7 days.\n- Between 17th and 24th: That's 7 days.\n\nWait, but looking again, row 35 is March 3rd, then the next match in March is March 7th. Then March 10th, etc.\n\nBut I just realized that there are no two consecutive matches within March that have a gap of just 2 days. The smallest gaps are between 4th and 3rd? Wait, let me recalculate:\n\nWait, from March 3 to March 7 is four days apart (since the next day after March 3 is 4th, then 5th, 6th, 7th\u2014so that's a gap of four days). Between March 7 and March 10: that's three days. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some matches in March? Let me double-check the rows:\n\nRow 35: 3 March\nRow 36: 7 March\nRow 37: 10 March\nRow 38: 17 March\nRow 39: 24 March\n\nWait, that's all. So between these, the smallest gap is three days (between 7th and 10th). There are no two consecutive matches in March with a two-day gap.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there are no two matches in March that are only two days apart.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the shortest time between two consecutive matches in March was two days. By examining all matches in March 2001 from the table data, none have a two-day gap between them.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 37, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 38, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 39, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
