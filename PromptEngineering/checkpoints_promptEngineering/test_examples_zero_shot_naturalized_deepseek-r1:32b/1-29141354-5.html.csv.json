    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"jessica ennis be the guest on andrew and jack guest episode broadcast on 4 may 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It's saying that Jessica Ennis was a guest on an Andrew and Jack episode that aired on April 4th, 2012? Wait, no, wait. The date in the claim is \"4 may 2012,\" so May 4th, 2012.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 3 has the first broadcast date as 4 May 2012. Let me check that row's details.\n\nIn Row 3:\n- Episode: 05x03\n- First broadcast: 4 may 2012\n- Andrew and Jack's guest: jessica ennis\n\nSo, according to this, Jessica Ennis was indeed the guest on the Andrew and Jack episode that aired on May 4th, 2012.\n\nWait, but in the claim, it says \"andrew and jack guest episode,\" which I think refers to the same thing as \"Andrew and Jack's guest.\" So everything matches up here.\n\nNo other rows have a broadcast date of 4 May 2012. Only Row 3 does, and that's where Jessica Ennis is listed as the guest. Therefore, the claim seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Jessica Ennis was the guest on an Andrew and Jack episode aired on May 4th, 2012. Checking the table, Row 3 has the broadcast date of 4 May 2012 and lists Jessica Ennis as the guest for Andrew and Jack.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Claim Components**: The claim mentions \"Jessica Ennis\" being a guest on an episode aired on \"4 may 2012.\"\n2. **Locate Relevant Row**: Look through each row's \"first broadcast\" date to find \"4 may 2012.\" This is found in Row 3.\n3. **Check Guest Information**: In Row 3, under the column \"andrew and jacks guest,\" it lists \"jessica ennis.\"\n4. **Verify Date Match**: The first broadcast date in Row 3 matches the claim's date.\n5. **Conclusion**: Since both the guest name and the broadcast date match the claim, it is TRUE.\n\n**Answer:**\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"first broadcast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"andrew and jacks guest\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the first broadcast with jessica ennis as andrew and jack guest be before may 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It's stating that Jessica Ennis was a guest for Andrew and Jack in an episode whose first broadcast was before May 2012.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with details about guests and broadcast dates. The relevant columns here are \"episode\", \"first broadcast\", and \"andrew and jacks guest\".\n\nI'll go through each row to find where Jessica Ennis is listed as a guest under Andrew and Jack.\n\nRow 1: Guest is Georgie Thompson, so not relevant.\nRow 2: Louise Hazel, nope.\nRow 3: Here's Jessica Ennis. The first broadcast date for this episode (05x03) is April 4, 2012. That's in April, which is before May 2012.\n\nSo the claim says that the first broadcast with Jessica Ennis as a guest was before May 2012. Since the broadcast on April 4 is indeed before May, the claim holds true.\n\nThe relevant cell here is row index 2 (since rows are zero-indexed; Row 3 is index 2), under the \"first broadcast\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"first broadcast\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
