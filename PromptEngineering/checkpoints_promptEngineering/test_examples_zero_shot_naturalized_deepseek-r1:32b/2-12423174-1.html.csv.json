    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"asc diaraf lose to stade malien in the 1971 african cup of champion club\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has multiple rows, each representing a match between two teams with details like aggregate score, first leg, and second leg scores.\n\nThe claim mentions \"asc diaraf\" and \"stade malien.\" Looking through the rows, Row 3 is about asc diaraf versus stade malien. Let's examine that row:\n\n- Team 1: asc diaraf\n- Agg (aggregate): 3 - 4\n- Team 2: stade malien\n- 1st leg: 3 - 0\n- 2nd leg: 0 - 4\n\nThe aggregate score is 3-4, which means asc diaraf scored 3 goals and stade malien scored 4. Since 4 > 3, stade malien won the match, so asc diaraf lost.\n\nNow, does this table correspond to the 1971 African Cup of Champion Clubs? The claim specifies 1971, but the table doesn't mention the year. However, given that the data is presented without a year, and assuming this table is about matches from 1971, or perhaps it's implied as part of the problem context, I can proceed.\n\nSo, based on the aggregate score in Row 3, asc diaraf lost to stade malien.

I need to determine whether the claim \"secteur 6 lose by 1 against enugu ranger\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the table to find where \"secteur 6\" and \"enugu rangers\" are mentioned.

    "claim": "the young african score 2 point in the 1971 african cup of champion club",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the young african score 2 point in the 1971 african cup of champion club\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim is saying. The subject here is \"young african,\" which seems to refer to a team called Young Africans. They are said to have scored 2 points in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Club.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there's a row for \"team 1: young africans\" on row 9. The other details here are:\n- agg (aggregate): 2 - 0\n- team 2: lavori publici\n- 1st leg: 2 - 0\n- 2nd leg: 0 - 0\n\nI'm trying to figure out if the aggregate score of 2-0 for Young Africans in this match translates to them scoring 2 points. In football (soccer), typically, a win gives you 3 points and a draw gives 1 point each, but I need to confirm how the points are calculated here.\n\nIn the context of tournaments like the African Cup of Champions Clubs, teams earn points based on wins, draws, or losses in each match. So, if Young Africans won both legs (since the aggregate is 2-0), they would have earned points for each leg result. The first leg was a win with a score of 2-0, and the second leg ended in a draw 0-0.\n\nIn most football competitions, a win gives 3 points, a draw gives 1 point to each team, and a loss gives 0 points. So for the first leg, Young Africans get 3 points, and for the second leg, they get another point because it's a draw. That adds up to 4 points in total.\n\nBut wait, the claim says they scored 2 points. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to goals rather than points? The aggregate score is 2-0, meaning Young Africans scored two goals in total across both legs. However, the claim mentions \"score 2 point,\" which sounds like points, not goals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in this competition's context, a team gets 2 points for winning and 1 for drawing. But that would mean Young Africans earned 2 (for the first leg win) plus 1 (for the draw), totaling 3 points, not 2. That doesn't align with the claim either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The aggregate score is just about goals, but the question is about points. So Young Africans scored 2-0 in total. But that's two goals, not points. If the claim is about points, then maybe they have 4 points as per standard rules.\n\nWait another thought: maybe in some tournaments, a win gives 2 points and a draw gives 1 point. Let me check. In many leagues, it's 3 for a win, but in some older systems or specific competitions, it might be different. For example, during the 1970s, some tournaments used 2 points for a win instead of 3.\n\nIf that's the case here, then Young Africans would have earned 2 points for winning the first leg and 0 for losing the second leg (since they drew). Wait no, in the second leg, it was a draw, so if it's 1 point each, but under an older system where a win is 2 points, maybe.\n\nWait, looking at row 9: team 1: young africans vs lavori publici. The aggregate is 2-0 for Young Africans. That means they won the tie because their total goals (from both legs) are higher than their opponents'.\n\nIn terms of points per match:\n\nFirst leg: Young Africans 2 - 0 Lavori Publici \u2192 Win, so maybe 2 points.\n\nSecond leg: Young Africans 0 - 0 Lavori Publici \u2192 Draw, so 1 point each. So in total, Young Africans have 3 points (2 + 1).\n\nBut the claim says they scored 2 points. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's considering only one match. The aggregate is over two legs, but maybe the question refers to a single game where they got 2-0 and thus earned 2 points if that was a win in that system.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the term \"points.\" In football, sometimes people confuse goals with points. So if Young Africans scored 2 goals in total (aggregate), then perhaps the claim is correct in terms of goals but not points.\n\nBut the question specifically mentions \"score 2 point,\" which implies points, not goals. Therefore, I'm a bit confused because based on standard football scoring systems, they would have either 3 or 4 points, depending on whether it's 3 points for a win or 2 points.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is referring to something else, like in terms of qualifying points for the competition overall, but that seems less likely.\n\nLooking again at row 9: The aggregate is 2-0 for Young Africans. They won both legs (2-0 and 0-0). Wait, no\u2014wait, in the first leg, they scored 2-0, which is a win, then in the second leg, it was 0-0, so that's a draw.\n\nSo if each win gives them points: If a win is 3 points, then for two legs, they have 3 (for the first) and 1 (for the draw), totaling 4 points. But if it's 2 points for a win, then they get 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nBut the claim says \"score 2 point,\" which doesn't match either scenario. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how points are calculated here. Alternatively, maybe the question is incorrect because Young Africans actually earned more than 2 points based on their results.\n\nWait another angle: Maybe in this context, they're only considering one leg where they scored two goals and that equates to two points. But that seems odd since points are awarded per match outcome, not per goal.\n\nIn summary, I'm a bit stuck because depending on the point system (2 or 3 points for a win), Young Africans would have either 3 or 4 points from their two legs. The claim states they scored 2 points, which doesn't align with either scenario unless there's an alternative scoring method or perhaps it's a mistranslation or misunderstanding of goals vs. points.\n\nGiven this confusion, but considering that the aggregate score is 2-0, if someone incorrectly equates goals to points, then they might say Young Africans scored 2 points (goals). So perhaps the claim is correct in terms of goals but not points.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The key here is that Young Africans won their tie with an aggregate score of 2-0. If each win gives them 2 points, then across both legs, they might have earned 4 points (since two wins), but no, in the second leg, it was a draw.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe this is about the total number of matches won and thus points. In some competitions, teams earn one point for each win in a match, regardless of the margin. So if they won one match (2-0) and drew the other, that's 1 point for the win plus 0 for the draw? No, usually draws give at least half a point.\n\nWait, maybe it's not about points earned from wins but something else entirely. Maybe it's referring to their position in the group or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is incorrect because Young Africans earned more than 2 points based on their results. So the answer would be that they didn't score just 2 points; they scored more.\n\nBut given the information, I think the safest assumption is that the aggregate score of 2-0 means they won and thus scored some points, but it's unclear exactly how many without knowing the exact point system used in that competition during that time.\n\nHowever, since the user asked whether Young Africans scored 2 points based on their performance, and considering possible systems where a win gives 2 points, I can say that if each leg is considered a separate match, then from two legs (one win, one draw), they would have earned 3 points (assuming a win is 2 and a draw is 1). But the claim says 2 points, so perhaps it's incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe in this case, only one point was awarded for winning each leg? That doesn't make much sense because usually, you get more points for a win. Alternatively, if it's a two-legged tie, and they won the tie with an aggregate score of 2-0, perhaps they earned 1 point for qualifying to the next round or something like that.\n\nBut without specific information on the competition's scoring system, it's hard to be precise. However, given the data in row 9, I can say that Young Africans won their two legs with an aggregate score of 2-0 and thus likely earned points accordingly, but not exactly 2 unless each win was worth 1 point.\n\nIn conclusion, based on standard football point systems (3 for a win), they would have 4 points, so the claim of 2 points is incorrect. Alternatively, if it's an older system where wins are 2 points, then their total would be 3 points, still not matching. Therefore, the answer might be that Young Africans did not score exactly 2 points based on their performance; they scored more.\n</think>\n\nYoung Africans won their two-legged tie with an aggregate score of 2-0. Based on standard football scoring systems where a win typically earns 3 points and a draw 1 point, they would have accumulated 4 points (3 for the first leg win and 1 for the second leg draw). Therefore, the claim that they scored exactly 2 points is incorrect. They earned more than 2 points from their performance.\n\nAnswer: Young Africans did not score exactly 2 points; they earned a total of 4 points based on their results.",

The first leg was 1-1, and the second leg was 0-1.\n\nThe aggregate score is 1-2, meaning enugu rangers won with a higher total. So, in this case, secteur 6 did not win against enugu rangers; instead, they lost by an aggregate of 1-2.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"secteur 6 win agains the enugu ranger\" is false based on the provided table data.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are from row 8, which include the team names and their scores in both legs. The aggregate score shows that secteur 6 lost to enugu rangers.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"canon yaound\u00e9 score zero points against their opponent\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the table represents.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it seems to be a list of match results between two teams in each row. Each row has several columns: team 1, agg (aggregate score), team 2, 1st leg, and 2nd leg scores. \n\nThe claim mentions \"canon yaound\u00e9\" and whether they scored zero points against their opponent. I think \"points\" here refers to the aggregate goals or maybe points in a league sense, but given the context of match results, it's more likely about goals.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row where team 1 is \"canon yaound\u00e9.\" Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 6: team 1 is canon yaound\u00e9. Their aggregate score (agg) is 9-4 against as solidarit\u00e9. The 1st leg was 7-3, and the 2nd leg was 2-1.\n\nSo, in this case, canon yaound\u00e9 scored a total of 9 goals across both legs. That's way more than zero points or goals. Therefore, the claim that they scored zero is false.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows where team 2 is canon yaound\u00e9 to make sure I'm not missing something. Scanning through all rows:\n\n- Rows 1 to 9: canon yaound\u00e9 only appears as team 1 in row 6. No other occurrence as team 2.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are in row 6. The agg column shows they scored 9 goals, which is definitely not zero. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification would be the aggregate score of canon yaound\u00e9 in that row, specifically their total points or goals. So, looking at the \"agg\" column for team 1 in row 6.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n   ]\n}",
