Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for Ireland in the table. Scanning through each row, I see that Row 34 is about Ireland. The columns are nation, gold, silver, bronze, total.\n\nLooking at the data for Ireland: gold is 0, silver is 1, bronze is 0. So they have only one silver medal and no other medals (gold or bronze). \n\nThe claim says exactly that\u2014Ireland has only 1 silver and no others. That matches perfectly with what's in the table.\n\nSo, all parts of the claim are supported by the data in Row 34. There's nothing conflicting here.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
