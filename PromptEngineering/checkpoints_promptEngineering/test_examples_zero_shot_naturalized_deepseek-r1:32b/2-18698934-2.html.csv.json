    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the claim \"the result be better in est\u00e1dio campo desportivo , macau than in sai tso wan recreation ground , hong kong\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. The claim is comparing results at two different venues: one in Macau and another in Hong Kong. So, I'll look for rows where these venues are listed.\n\nLooking at Row 1, the venue is \"est\u00e1dio campo desportivo , macau.\" The result there was a score of 5-1. Now, checking who scored which part isn't specified here, but the overall result is 5-1 in favor of one team. \n\nNext, I'll look for the venue \"sai tso wan recreation ground , hong kong.\" That's Row 3. The result there was 1-0. Again, not sure who scored, but the overall result here is a narrower margin compared to Row 1.\n\nThe claim states that the result was better in Macau than in Hong Kong. I assume \"better\" refers to a more decisive win or a higher score differential. In Row 1, the difference is 4 goals (5-1), while in Row 3, it's just 1 goal (1-0). Therefore, the result at the Macau venue was indeed better in terms of score difference.\n\nSo, based on these two rows, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"siu sai wan sport ground , hong kong be the venue after it be hold in est\u00e1dio campo desportivo , macau.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It seems like it's claiming that the venue \"siu sai wan sports ground\" in Hong Kong was used as a venue after another venue, \"est\u00e1dio campo desportivo\" in Macau.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five rows of data. Each row has details about a match: date, venue, result, scored, and competition. Let's go through each row to see which venues were used and when.\n\nRow 1: Date is June 20, 2010, Venue is Est\u00e1dio Campo Desportivo in Macau. So that's the first mention of a venue in Macau.\n\nRow 2: November 2, 2010, Siu Sai Wan Sports Ground in Hong Kong. That seems to be the second venue mentioned.\n\nSo from this, it looks like the first event was at Est\u00e1dio Campo Desportivo on June 20, and then later on November 2, there was a match at Siu Sai Wan. So the claim is that Hong Kong's venue came after Macau's. From these two rows, it seems correct because June comes before November.\n\nBut wait, I should check all the other rows to make sure there isn't another venue in Macau or any other sequence that might affect this conclusion. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 3: January 26, 2011, Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground in Hong Kong.\nRow 4: February 9, 2011, Po Kong Village Park in Hong Kong.\nRow 5: June 3, 2010, Xianghe Sports Center in Beijing.\n\nLooking at all the venues, the only Macau venue is in Row 1 on June 20. The next one in Hong Kong is November 2, which is after June 20. So the claim that Siu Sai Wan was used after Macau's stadium seems to hold true based on these two specific rows.\n\nI don't see any other entries for Macau or conflicting dates that would suggest otherwise. All other venues are either in Hong Kong or Beijing but not Macau again. Therefore, the relevant cells are Row 1 (Venue: Macau) and Row 2 (Venue: Hong Kong). These support the claim that the Hong Kong venue was used after the Macau one.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Siu Sai Wan Sports Ground in Hong Kong was held after Est\u00e1dio Campo Desportivo in Macau. The relevant cells are from Row 1 and Row 2, both under the \"venue\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"only the 26 january 2011 game in sai tso wan recreation ground, hong kong score more than 0\".\n\nFirst, let's break down what this means. The claim is saying that among all the games listed, only the one on 26 January 2011 at that specific venue had a score greater than zero. So, I need to check each row in the table to see if any other game scored more than zero.\n\nLooking at Row 3: It's the game on 26 Jan 2011, venue sai tso wan recreation ground, Hong Kong. The result is 1 - 0, so the score for this match was more than zero (specifically, one goal). That aligns with the claim.\n\nNow, I need to check all other rows to see if any of them have a scored value greater than zero. \n\nRow 1: Result is 5-1. The 'scored' column shows 0. So even though the team might have scored goals in the game, the 'scored' field here is zero. Wait, no\u2014actually, looking back, the columns are date, venue, result, scored, competition.\n\nWait, maybe I misread that. Let me clarify: each row has a 'result', which shows the score of both teams, and then a 'scored' column which seems to indicate how many goals were scored by the team in question. For example, Row 1's result is 5-1, but the 'scored' is 0. That might mean that the team this table represents didn't score any goals in that game, even though the other team did.\n\nSo for the claim, it's about whether any other games besides the one on 26 Jan 2011 had a scored value greater than zero.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Scored is 0. So no.\nRow 2: Scored is 0. No.\nRow 3: Scored is 1. Yes, this is the game in question.\nRow 4: Scored is 0. No.\nRow 5: Scored is 0. No.\n\nSo only Row 3 has a scored value greater than zero. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because no other games have a score higher than zero except for that one.\n\nThe relevant cells are where the 'scored' column has values more than zero and the venue and date matching the claim. So, in this case, it's only Row 3's scored cell.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"scored\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's check if February 9, 2011 is indeed the last game in the list. Looking at the dates in each row:\n\n- Row 1: June 20, 2010\n- Row 2: November 2, 2010\n- Row 3: January 26, 2011\n- Row 4: February 9, 2011\n- Row 5: June 3, 2010\n\nWait, that last row seems off. Wait no, actually, looking again, the dates are:\n\nRow 5 is on June 3, 2010. So arranging all dates in order, the latest date is February 9, 2011 (Row 4). Then Row 3 is January 26, 2011 which is earlier than February. The other rows are before that as well. So yes, February 9, 2011 is indeed the last game listed.\n\nNext, checking the score of that game. In Row 4, under 'result' it's 1 - 4. So the claim says \"it score 1 - 4\", which matches exactly.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are correct: the date is the last game and the result is as stated.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}]}",

So, the claim says: \"4 of 5 competition be friendly, with only 1 2010 Hong Kong - Macau Interport.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and see how many competitions are marked as 'friendly' versus others.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Competition is \"2010 hong kong - macau interport.\" So that's not friendly.\nRow 2: Competition is \"friendly.\"\nRow 3: Competition is \"friendly.\"\nRow 4: Competition is \"friendly.\"\nRow 5: Competition is \"friendly.\"\n\nSo, out of the five competitions listed:\n\n- Row 1 is not friendly; it's a specific interport competition.\n- Rows 2, 3, 4, and 5 are all friendly.\n\nThat makes four friendly competitions and one that isn't. So the claim says exactly that: 4 friendly and only 1 being the Hong Kong-Macau Interport.

The claim says, \"the result be the same in est\u00e1dio campo desportivo as xianghe sport center.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows in the table correspond to these two venues. Looking at Row 1, the venue is Est\u00e1dio Campo Desportivo in Macau. The result there was 5-1. Then, looking for Xianghe Sports Center, I find that in Row 5, the venue is Xianghe Sports Center in Beijing with a result of 2-2.\n\nWait, but the claim is about whether the results are the same at these two venues. So I need to compare their results. The first result is 5-1, and the second is 2-2. Those are definitely different. \n\nSo the claim is saying that both venues have the same result, but according to the table, they don't. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nTo make sure I'm not missing anything, let me double-check each row again. Row 1: date is June 20, 2010; venue as mentioned; result 5-1. That's correct. Row 5 is on June 3, 2010, at Xianghe Sports Center with a 2-2 draw. Yep, that's different.\n\nI think I've got it right. The results are not the same, so the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant rows are 1 and 5.

The claim states: \"siu sai wan sport ground , hong kong be the venue before it be hold in est\u00e1dio campo desportivo  , macau.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse what this means. It seems like the claim is saying that Siu Sai Wan Sports Ground in Hong Kong was a venue used before Est\u00e1dio Campo Desportivo in Macau for some event.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find mentions of these venues and their dates to check the order.\n\nRow 1: Date is 20 June 2010, Venue is Est\u00e1dio Campo Desportivo, Macau. So that's one instance where Macau was used on June 20, 2010.\n\nRow 2: Date is 2 November 2010, Venue is Siu Sai Wan Sports Ground, Hong Kong. That's the first mention of Hong Kong's venue on November 2, 2010.\n\nWait, so Macau was used in June 2010 and Hong Kong in November 2010. So Macau was before Hong Kong? But the claim says Hong Kong was before Macau. That would mean the claim is incorrect because Macau's event happened earlier.\n\nBut wait, I should check all rows to ensure there are no other mentions of these venues that might affect the timeline.\n\nRow 3: Date is 26 January 2011, Venue is Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground, Hong Kong. Another Hong Kong venue but later in 2011.\n\nRow 4: 9 February 2011, Venue Po Kong Village Park, Hong Kong.\n\nRow 5: 3 June 2010, Venue Xianghe Sports Center, Beijing. That's a different location.\n\nSo, the two relevant rows are Row 1 (Macau in June 2010) and Row 2 (Hong Kong in November 2010). Since June comes before November, Macau was used first, not Hong Kong as the claim suggests.

The venue is sai tso wan recreation ground, Hong Kong.

The result column says 1 - 0. I'm assuming the first number is Hong Kong's score since it's listed as the home team in that row. So Hong Kong scored 1 goal and the other team didn't score any.\n\nThe claim states that Hong Kong scored more than 1 on that date. But according to the table, they only scored 1. Therefore, the claim is not supported\u2014it's FALSE.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the \"scored\" column for Row 3, it shows 1, which directly indicates how many goals were scored by Hong Kong in that match.

The claim says none were friendly, but this row clearly shows a friendly competition.
