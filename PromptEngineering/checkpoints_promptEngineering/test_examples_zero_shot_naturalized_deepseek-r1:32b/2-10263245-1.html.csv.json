    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the data provided in the table. The claim states: \"the match against lucian bute be 1 of the 5 fight that librado andrade lose.\" So, first off, I need to parse this correctly. It looks like there's a typo with \"be\" instead of \"is,\" so the intended meaning is probably that the match against Lucian Bute is one of the five fights that Librado Andrade lost.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight in Librado Andrade's career. The relevant columns here are 'Opponent' and 'Result.' The claim mentions two specific points: that there was a match against Lucian Bute, and that this particular loss is one of five losses in total for Andrade.\n\nFirst step is to find if there's any entry where the opponent is Lucian Bute. Scanning through the rows, I see several opponents like 'lucian bute' in row 4 and again in row 5. Let me check those.\n\nIn row 4: Opponent is lucian bute, Result is lose.\nRow 5: Opponent is lucian bute, Result is lose.\n\nWait a minute, that's two losses against Bute? That seems unusual because typically, boxers don't fight the same opponent multiple times unless there was a rematch. But in this table, both rows have the same opponent and result. So perhaps it's just one fight recorded twice? Or maybe they actually had two fights.\n\nBut regardless, for the claim, we're only concerned with whether there is at least one loss against Bute. From row 4, that's clear: Andrade lost to Lucian Bute.\n\nNext, I need to count how many total losses Andrade has according to this table. Scanning through each row:\n\nRow 4: lose\nRow 5: lose\n\nWait, that's two losses in the same opponent? Or is it a typo? Looking at all rows, I only see two 'lose' results: both against Lucian Bute.\n\nSo, Andrade has two losses according to this table. The claim says \"1 of the 5 fights,\" but based on the data, he's lost only twice. Therefore, the statement that his loss against Bute is one of five losses isn't accurate because he actually only has two losses in total here.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check all rows for any other 'lose' results beyond rows 4 and 5.\n\nGoing through each row from 1 to 35:\n\nRows 4: lose\nRow 5: lose\n\nNo other entries have a result of 'lose.' All others are either 'win' or 'ko' etc., which I assume are wins. So, Andrade has only two losses in this table.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the Bute fight is one of five losses isn't correct because he's lost only twice. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Librado Andrade lost to Lucian Bute and that this loss is one of five total losses. However, upon reviewing the data, there are only two losses recorded: both against Lucian Bute.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by carefully analyzing each part of the claim.\n\nFirst, I should look for entries where Librado Andrade fought against Paul Jones. The table lists various opponents and outcomes for Librado Andrade. Scanning through the rows, I find a relevant entry at row 33: \"opponent\": \"paul jones\", \"result\": \"win\". This indicates that in this particular fight, Librado Andrade won against Paul Jones.\n\nThe claim states that Andrade never wins against Paul Jones. However, since there is at least one instance where he did win (as seen in row 33), the claim is not fully supported by the data. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n\nTo support this conclusion, I need to identify the relevant cells from the table that contradict the claim. The key information here is the result of the fight against Paul Jones and the specific opponent's name. Thus, the relevant cells are in row 33 under the columns \"opponent\" and \"result\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the most recent fight that Librado Andrade won was on 2011-08-27.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. \"Most recent\" implies that among all the fights Librado Andrade has won, this is the one with the latest date. So, I need to look through the table and find all entries where he was the winner, then check their dates.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 35 rows listed, each representing a fight. Each row has columns like \"Date,\" \"Opponent,\" \"Result,\" etc., but in this case, since the user provided specific details about each row (like date and opponent), I can infer that each row corresponds to one of his fights.\n\nI'll go through each row starting from the top to see which ones are wins. \n\nRow 2: Date is 2011-08-27. The result isn't explicitly stated, but since it's in a list of his wins, I can assume this was a win. Opponent is Librado Andrade vs. someone else.\n\nThen, looking further down:\n\nRows 3 to 35 have various dates going back from 2011 down to 1999. Each row lists an opponent and the date. For example, Row 4: 2011-08-27 is also listed again with a different opponent. Wait, that's confusing because it shows two fights on the same day? That might be a typo or duplication in the table.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check each row carefully:\n\nRow 1 (assuming rows start at index 1): Date: 2011-08-27, Opponent: Librado Andrade vs. someone else. Result is a win.\n\nThen Row 2 also has the same date and opponent? Or maybe different opponents but same date? That seems unlikely unless he had multiple fights on the same day, which is rare.\n\nWait, perhaps each row represents a fight where he was involved, either as winner or loser, but in this case, since all rows are his wins, each row is a win. So I need to find the most recent (latest) date among these wins.\n\nLooking through the dates:\n\nThe latest date is 2011-08-27. There are multiple entries on that date: Rows 2 and 3 both have this date with different opponents. Then, other rows have earlier dates like 2011-06-24, 2011-05-25, etc., going back to 1999.\n\nSo the most recent fight he won was on 2011-08-27.

    "claim": "librado andrade have a fight with terry smith after the fight with marcus harvey",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out whether the claim \"librado andrade have a fight with terry smith after the fight with marcus harvey\" is true based on the given table of fights.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It states that Librado Andrade fought Terry Smith after fighting Marcus Harvey. So, I need to check two things: \n\n1. Did Librado Andrade fight Marcus Harvey?\n2. After that fight, did he then fight Terry Smith?\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different opponent and details about the fight.\n\nStarting with the first part of the claim: fighting Marcus Harvey. Let's scan through the \"opponent\" column to find any entry where Librado Andrade fought Marcus Harvey. \n\nLooking through rows 30 and 35, both mention fights against Marcus Harvey. Specifically, row 30 has the date August 17, 2000, and row 35 on August 14, 1999.\n\nNext, checking if Terry Smith was fought after Marcus Harvey. In row 32, there's a fight with Terry Smith on April 13, 2000. \n\nNow, comparing the dates: the fights against Marcus Harvey were in August 17, 2000 (row 30) and August 14, 1999 (row 35). The fight against Terry Smith was on April 13, 2000.\n\nWait a minute, the fight with Terry Smith is after August 14, 1999, but before August 17, 2000. So if Librado fought Marcus Harvey in August 2000, then Terry's fight was earlier than that. But he also fought Marcus Harvey in August 1999.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me clarify:\n\n- The fight against Terry Smith on April 13, 2000.\n- Fights against Marcus Harvey on August 17, 2000 and August 14, 1999.\n\nSo, if we consider the order, Librado fought Terry Smith in April 2000 and then fought Marcus Harvey in August 2000. That would mean he fought Terry before Marcus. But the claim says after fighting Marcus. So that doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, the fight against Marcus on August 14, 1999 is earlier than Terry's fight on April 13, 2000. So in this case, Librado fought Marcus first and then Terry later. That would support the claim if the dates were correct, but according to the table, the fights with Marcus are both before or after Terry.\n\nWait, no. Let me check again:\n\n- Fight with Terry Smith: April 13, 2000 (row 32)\n- Fight with Marcus Harvey: August 17, 2000 (row 30) and August 14, 1999 (row 35)\n\nSo, the fight against Terry is on April 2000. The fight against Marcus in August 2000 is after that, so Librado fought Terry before Marcus. That would mean the claim is incorrect because he didn't fight Terry after Marcus.\n\nBut wait, another fight with Marcus was in August 1999 (row 35). So if we consider that, Librado fought Marcus in August 1999 and then Terry in April 2000. In this case, the order is correct: Terry Smith comes after Marcus Harvey.\n\nBut wait, row 35 shows a fight against Marcus on August 14, 1999 (row 35) with result UD. Then, row 32, Terry Smith on April 13, 2000. So yes, in this case, the order is correct: he fought Marcus first and then Terry.\n\nBut wait, there's another fight against Marcus on August 17, 2000 (row 30), which is after Terry's fight. So depending on which fight with Marcus we're considering, the claim could be either true or false.\n\nThe claim says \"after the fight with Marcus Harvey.\" It doesn't specify which one, so perhaps it refers to any fight with Marcus before fighting Terry.\n\nLooking at row 35: fight against Marcus on August 14, 1999, then Terry on April 13, 2000. That's a valid sequence where Terry is after Marcus.\n\nBut also, in row 30, he fought Marcus again on August 17, 2000, which was after fighting Terry on April 2000. So that would mean the fight with Terry was before Marcus, contradicting the claim.\n\nSo the table shows two fights against Marcus: one before and one after Terry's fight. Therefore, there is at least one instance where he fought Terry after Marcus (the August 1999 fight). However, since the claim doesn't specify which fight with Marcus it refers to, but generally, the order can be both ways.\n\nBut in reality, the table shows that Librado fought Terry on April 2000 and then Marcus again on August 2000. So after fighting Terry, he fought Marcus again. Therefore, the claim might not hold if considering the later fight with Marcus.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key is whether there was a fight against Terry Smith that occurred after any fight against Marcus Harvey.\n\nIn row 35: Marcus on August 14, 1999. Then Terry on April 13, 2000. So yes, in this case, Terry comes after Marcus.\n\nBut then he fought Marcus again on August 17, 2000 (row 30), which is after Terry's fight. So the order is: Marcus (1999) \u2192 Terry (2000) \u2192 Marcus (2000).\n\nTherefore, the claim could be true in the sense that he fought Terry after one of his fights with Marcus.\n\nBut I think the confusion arises because there are two separate fights against Marcus. The claim says \"after the fight with Marcus Harvey,\" implying a specific instance where Terry was fought after that particular Marcus fight.\n\nLooking at row 35, after fighting Marcus on August 14, 1999, he did have a fight against Terry Smith on April 13, 2000. So yes, in this case, the order is correct: Marcus first, then Terry.\n\nHowever, looking at the dates again:\n\n- Row 35: Marcus on August 14, 1999\n- Row 32: Terry on April 13, 2000\n\nSo yes, April comes after August? Wait no, April is earlier than August. So if he fought Marcus in August 1999 and then Terry in April 2000, that's correct because April 2000 is after August 1999.\n\nBut wait, that would mean Terry was fought after Marcus. However, the fight against Marcus on August 17, 2000 (row 30) is after Terry's fight in April 2000. So he also fought Marcus again after Terry.\n\nSo depending on which fight with Marcus we consider, the order can vary. The claim doesn't specify which fight, so perhaps it's referring to any instance where after a fight with Marcus, he fought Terry. But given that there are two fights with Marcus, one before and one after Terry, it complicates things.\n\nWait no, because in row 35, the fight against Marcus is on August 14, 1999, and then Terry on April 13, 2000 (row 32), which is indeed after. So that sequence fits: Marcus \u2192 Terry.\n\nHowever, he fought Marcus again on August 17, 2000 (row 30), which was after Terry's fight in April 2000. But the claim doesn't specify a particular date, so it could be referring to either of his fights with Marcus.\n\nTherefore, there is at least one instance where he fought Terry after fighting Marcus (the August 1999 fight). So based on that, the claim would hold true for that specific sequence.\n\nWait, but in the table, row 35 is before row 32. Let me make sure of the order:\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Row 30: Opponent Marcus Harvey, date August 17, 2000\n- Row 35: Opponent Marcus Harvey, date August 14, 1999\n\nWait, that's not correct. The table lists fights in order from row 1 to row 35, which would mean that the later rows are actually earlier dates because as we go down, the years decrease.\n\nWait no, looking at the structure of the table, each row is a separate fight, and the opponent and date vary. So I need to check the actual dates regardless of the row order.\n\nRow 30: Opponent Marcus Harvey, August 17, 2000\nRow 32: Terry Smith, April 13, 2000\nRow 35: Marcus Harvey, August 14, 1999\n\nSo, in terms of actual dates:\n\n- Row 35: August 14, 1999 (earlier)\n- Row 32: April 13, 2000 (later than 1999 but earlier than 2000 August)\n- Row 30: August 17, 2000 (latest)\n\nSo the order of fights is:\n\n1. Marcus on August 14, 1999\n2. Terry on April 13, 2000\n3. Marcus again on August 17, 2000\n\nTherefore, in this timeline, Terry's fight (April 2000) comes after the first Marcus fight (August 1999). So yes, there is a sequence where he fought Terry after fighting Marcus.\n\nBut then, after that, he fought Marcus again. So the claim can be true for the April 2000 Terry fight as it occurred after the August 1999 Marcus fight.\n\nHowever, if someone interprets the claim as \"after his last fight with Marcus,\" that would not hold because the last fight was in August 2000, and there's no Terry fight after that. But since the claim doesn't specify, it can be considered true based on the sequence of one of the fights.\n\nTherefore, based on the table, yes, he did fight Terry after fighting Marcus in at least one instance.\n</think>\n\nYes, based on the provided information, there is a sequence where the individual fought Terry Smith (April 13, 2000) after having fought Marcus Harvey (August 14, 1999). Therefore, the claim holds true for that specific instance.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{Yes}}$",

Since we're interested in wins, I'll focus on rows where the result is a win.\n\nI need to go through each row, check if it's a win, note the date, and then find the earliest date among those wins.\n\nLet me start from the top of the table:\n\nRow 2: Date 2011-08-27, Result Win. That's one possible candidate for the oldest fight.\n\nThen I'll continue checking all other rows to see if there are any earlier dates with a win result.\n\nRows after that have dates like 2011-06-19 (Row 3), which is earlier than 2011-08-27. Wait, but looking at Row 3: opponent is Jimmy Hagar, date 2001-06-19? Wait no, I think I got confused. Let me recount the rows.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the table starts from row 2 up to row 35, with dates ranging from 2000 to 2011. So I need to check all wins and find their dates.\n\nLet's list all the wins:\n\nRow 2: 2011-08-27, Win\nRow 3: 2001-06-19, Win\nRow 4: 2000-05-18, Win\n...\nContinuing down, there are multiple rows with \"result\" as Win. The earliest date among all these wins would be the oldest fight he won.\n\nWait a minute, looking at Row 3, the date is 2001-06-19, which is earlier than 2011-08-27. So that's an older win. Similarly, Row 4 is 2000-05-18, which is even earlier. So actually, the oldest fight he won isn't on 2011-08-27 but much earlier.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there are fights that Librado Andrade won before August 27, 2011.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the oldest win was in 2011, but examining the table shows wins as early as 2000. Thus, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Librado Andrade have a fight with Terry Smith before the fight with Marcus Harvey\" is true or false based on the provided table data.\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into two main parts:\n1. Librado Andrade fought Terry Smith.\n2. This fight happened before his fight with Marcus Harvey.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different fight by Librado Andrade. The columns include details like opponent name, date, result, etc.\n\nTo verify if there's a fight between Librado and Terry Smith, I'll search through the \"Opponent\" column for \"Terry Smith\". Scanning down, I find Row 32 where the opponent is Terry Smith. So, that confirms the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, I need to check when this fight took place relative to his fight with Marcus Harvey. The dates are listed in the \"Date\" column. For Terry Smith's fight (Row 32), the date is April 13, 2000. Now, looking for Marcus Harvey in the opponent list, I find two entries: Row 30 on August 17, 2000, and Row 35 on August 14, 1999.\n\nWait a minute, that's interesting. The fight with Terry Smith is April 13, 2000, while the fight with Marcus Harvey in Row 35 is earlier, on August 14, 1999. So, according to this data, the fight against Terry Smith happened after the one against Marcus Harvey.\n\nBut wait, there's another entry for Marcus Harvey in Row 30, which is on August 17, 2000. That's later than April 13, 2000. So Librado fought Terry Smith on April 13, 2000, and then fought Marcus Harvey again on August 17, 2000.\n\nWait, but the claim says that the fight with Terry Smith was before the one with Marcus Harvey. However, based on the data, in Row 32 (Terry Smith), it's April 13, 2000, and Row 30 is August 17, 2000. So Terry Smith's fight comes first.\n\nBut I also see that in Row 35, Marcus Harvey was fought on August 14, 1999, which is earlier than April 13, 2000. That might be a different fight between them. But the claim doesn't specify the dates, just the order of fights.\n\nSo according to the data provided, Librado Andrade did fight Terry Smith before fighting Marcus Harvey on August 17, 2000. The earlier fight with Marcus Harvey in 1999 would have been prior to both those events, but the specific sequence between Terry and the later Marcus fight is correct.\n\nWait no, that can't be right because Row 35 (Marcus Harvey) is August 14, 1999, which is before April 2000. So if the claim is about a specific instance where he fought Terry Smith before Marcus Harvey, then looking at Row 32 and Row 30: Terry on April 2000, Marcus on August 2000, so Terry was indeed before Marcus in that context.\n\nBut I'm getting confused because there's another fight with Marcus earlier. The claim doesn't specify which instance of fighting Marcus Harvey, but based on the table, he fought Terry Smith on April 13, 2000, and then later on August 17, 2000, fought Marcus Harvey again.\n\nSo in that specific case, the fight with Terry Smith was indeed before the fight with Marcus Harvey. Therefore, the claim is true because there's a recorded fight between Librado Andrade and Terry Smith (Row 32) which occurred before his fight with Marcus Harvey on August 17, 2000 (Row 30). The earlier fight in 1999 doesn't affect the sequence mentioned in the claim.\n\nWait no, I think I made a mistake. The claim is that he fought Terry Smith before fighting Marcus Harvey. But in Row 35, he fought Marcus on August 14, 1999, which is earlier than Terry's fight in April 2000. So if the claim refers to the first fight with Marcus, then it's after Terry. However, the claim doesn't specify a particular instance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to two specific fights: one against Terry and one against Marcus, in that order. In that case, looking at the table, he fought Terry on April 13, 2000 (Row 32), and then Marcus again on August 17, 2000 (Row 30). So yes, Terry came before Marcus in this context.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because there's another fight with Marcus earlier. Maybe the claim is about two consecutive fights where he fought Terry first and then Marcus. In that case, it's accurate based on Rows 32 and 30.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true. Librado Andrade fought Terry Smith before fighting Marcus Harvey again in August 2000.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nYes, the claim is true. The fight against Terry Smith occurred on April 13, 2000 (Row 32), which was before his subsequent fight with Marcus Harvey on August 17, 2000 (Row 30). Therefore, Librado Andrade did have a fight with Terry Smith before the fight with Marcus Harvey.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - Terry Smith: Row 32, Date April 13, 2000.\n   - Marcus Harvey: Two entries; Row 35 (August 14, 1999) and Row 30 (August 17, 2000).\n\n2. **Determine Order of Fights:**\n   - Terry Smith's fight is April 13, 2000.\n   - The later Marcus Harvey fight is August 17, 2000.\n\n3. **Verify Sequence:**\n   - Since April 2000 comes before August 2000, the fight with Terry Smith (Row 32) occurred before the subsequent fight with Marcus Harvey (Row 30).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is true based on the provided data.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nYes, Librado Andrade fought Terry Smith before fighting Marcus Harvey in August 2000.",
