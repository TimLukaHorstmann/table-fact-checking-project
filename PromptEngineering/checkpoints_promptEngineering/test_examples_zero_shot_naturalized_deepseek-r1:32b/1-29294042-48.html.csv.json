    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"not 1 kazakhstani advance to the quarterfinal or past that\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the table structure. It has five rows, each representing a different athlete from Kazakhstan (since their national codes are KAZ, like 'kuw' which I assume stands for Kuwait? Wait, no, actually looking at the data: in row 1, the opponent is from TLS and KUW, so perhaps it's not all Kazakhstani athletes. Hmm, but the athlete names seem to be Kazakh.)\n\nWait, actually, each row represents a Kazakhstani athlete because their event codes are as per their country. So all five rows are about Kazakhstani athletes.\n\nNow, the claim is that none of them advanced beyond the quarterfinals or further. So I need to check for each athlete if they made it to the quarterfinals or beyond.\n\nLooking at row 1: nariman shakirov's event is finweight (-54 kg). His round of 32 was a win (w pts 19-5), then in the round of 16, he lost (l pts 4-6). So he didn't make it past the Round of 16. Therefore, he didn't reach the quarterfinals.\n\nRow 2: zhalgas bekkassymov is flyweight (-58 kg). He had a bye in the round of 32, then lost in the round of 16 (l pts 3-4). So again, no quarterfinals.\n\nRow 3: darkhan kassymkulov in bantamweight (-63 kg). Round of 32 he won, but then lost in the round of 16. So same as above.\n\nRow 4: aibar dyussebayev in lightweight (-74 kg). Bye in R32, lost in R16 (l pts 3-4). No advancement beyond.\n\nRow 5: sultan kassymov in welterweight (-80 kg). Bye in R32, lost in R16 (l pts 2-6). So none advanced past the round of 16. \n\nWait, but what about the quarterfinals column? Let me check each row's \"quarterfinals\" status.\n\nRow 1: Quarterfinals: did not advance.\nRow 2: same.\nRow3: same.\nRow4: same.\nRow5: same.\n\nSo all of them did not make it to the quarterfinals or beyond.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the lightest competitor weighs 54 kilogram\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the term \"lightest competitor\" refers to the athlete with the lowest weight category. The claim states that this lightest competitor's weight is 54 kilograms. I need to check if any athlete in the table has a weight category of -54 kg and confirm if that's indeed the lightest category present.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an athlete with their respective event categories:\n\n1. Nariman Shakirov: Finweight (-54 kg)\n2. Zhalgas Bekkassymov: Flyweight (-58 kg)\n3. Darkhan Kassymkulov: Bantamweight (-63 kg)\n4. Aibar Dyussebayev: Lightweight (-74 kg)\n5. Sultan Kassymov: Welterweight (-80 kg)\n\nThe weight categories listed are in ascending order from -54 kg up to -80 kg. The term \"finweight\" is typically the lightest category, so Nariman Shakirov's event being Finweight at -54 kg would make him the lightest competitor.\n\nNow, checking each athlete's event:\n\n- Nariman Shakirov is in Finweight (-54 kg)\n- The next is Flyweight at 58 kg, which is heavier than 54 kg.\n  \nSince all other athletes are in higher weight categories (heavier than -54 kg), Nariman Shakirov is indeed the lightest competitor. Therefore, the claim that the lightest competitor weighs 54 kilograms is correct.\n\nThe relevant cells to support this are in Row 1 under the \"event\" column, which specifies his weight category as Finweight (-54 kg).\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"event\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine if the claim \"the heaviest competitor weigh 80 kilogram\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that the heaviest competitor weighs 80 kilograms. So, my task is to verify this by checking each row in the table to find the athlete with the highest weight and see if it's exactly 80 kg.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\nEach row represents an athlete with their respective event weights. The events are listed as finweight (-54kg), flyweight (-58kg), bantamweight (-63kg), lightweight (-74kg), and welterweight (-80kg). \n\nWait a minute, I should clarify: the event names include a hyphen before the weight class (e.g., \"- 54 kg\"). Does this mean that these are the upper limits of their weight categories? So, each athlete competes in a category that doesn't exceed a certain weight. Therefore, the heaviest category would be welterweight (-80kg), meaning athletes in this category weigh up to 80 kg.\n\nNow, looking at the claim: it says \"the heaviest competitor weigh 80 kilogram.\" If we consider the event categories as upper limits, then the heaviest competitors are those in the -80kg category. So, the maximum weight allowed is 80 kg. However, does this mean that all athletes in this category actually weigh exactly 80 kg? Not necessarily. They could be lighter than or up to 80 kg.\n\nLooking back at the table, in row 5, the athlete is sultan kassymov in the welterweight (-80kg) event. The events for each athlete don't specify their exact weight; they only mention the category. So, we can infer that sultan kassymov's weight is up to 80 kg, but not necessarily exactly 80 kg.\n\nTherefore, the claim states that the heaviest competitor weighs exactly 80 kg. However, based on the table, we don't have exact weights of each athlete; only their event categories are given. So, while the highest category is -80kg, which suggests athletes in this category weigh up to 80 kg, it doesn't confirm that any athlete actually weighs exactly 80 kg.\n\nHence, since the table doesn't provide individual athletes' exact weights beyond their categories, we cannot definitively say that the heaviest competitor weighs 80 kg. The claim might be implying that the maximum weight category is 80 kg, which is true, but the wording suggests an athlete's actual weight is 80 kg.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me re-examine. If \"the heaviest competitor\" refers to someone in the highest weight class, then that would be welterweight (-80kg). So the maximum allowed weight for a competitor in this category is 80 kg. Therefore, if an athlete is in this category, their weight is \u226480 kg. But does that mean they are exactly 80 kg? Not necessarily; they could be lighter.\n\nBut the claim says \"weigh 80 kilogram.\" So unless someone actually weighs 80 kg, it's not necessarily true. Since the table doesn't provide exact weights, only categories, we can't confirm any athlete is exactly 80 kg.\n\nWait again, maybe the event weight indicates that they are in that category, so perhaps their actual weight is within that limit, but not necessarily the maximum. So without knowing each athlete's exact weight, we can't be sure if any of them are exactly 80 kg.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the table because it only provides the upper limits of the categories, not the individual athletes' weights.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because while the highest event category is -80kg, indicating competitors weigh up to that weight, the table doesn't specify any athlete's exact weight as 80 kg.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the mean weight of all competitor be 65.8 kilogram\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at what the table contains. There are five athletes listed, each with their respective events and round results. The key piece here is the event column because it mentions weight categories like \"finweight (-54 kg)\", \"flyweight (-58 kg)\", etc. These weight classes likely indicate the maximum weight allowed for each category.\n\nThe claim talks about the mean (average) weight of all competitors being 65.8 kilograms. To check this, I'll need to extract the weights from the events and then calculate their average.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Nariman Shakirov: Finweight (-54 kg)\n2. Zhalgas Bekkassymov: Flyweight (-58 kg)\n3. Darkhan Kassymkulov: Bantamweight (-63 kg)\n4. Aibar Dyussebayev: Lightweight (-74 kg)\n5. Sultan Kassymov: Welterweight (-80 kg)\n\nSo the weights are 54, 58, 63, 74, and 80 kilograms.\n\nNow, let's compute the mean:\n\nFirst, add them all up:\n54 + 58 = 112\n112 + 63 = 175\n175 + 74 = 249\n249 + 80 = 329\n\nTotal sum is 329 kg.\n\nNow, divide by the number of athletes, which is 5:\n329 / 5 = 65.8\n\nWait a minute, that's exactly what the claim says! So the average weight would be 65.8 kg.\n\nBut wait, hold on. The event names have \"-X kg\" which usually denotes the upper limit of the weight category. Does this mean each athlete weighs less than or equal to X kg? Or is it their exact weight?\n\nThe problem statement doesn't specify if these are the exact weights of the athletes or just the categories they're competing in. If they're only indicating the categories, then we don't know the actual weights of the athletes themselves\u2014only the maximum allowed for each category.\n\nHowever, the claim refers to the mean weight of all competitors. If \"competitor\" here is interpreted as the athlete's bodyweight, and if these numbers are their actual weights, then it would compute correctly. But if they're just category limits, we can't assume each athlete weighed exactly that; some might have been under.\n\nBut given the context and the way the table is presented, I think the \"-X kg\" denotes the weight class each athlete competes in, not necessarily their exact body weight. Therefore, using these numbers as actual weights to compute the mean could be misleading because athletes typically weigh less than or equal to the category limit but not exactly that number.\n\nWait, but if we take them at face value, assuming that each \"-X kg\" is the athlete's weight, then 54 +58+63+74+80 equals 329, divided by 5 is indeed 65.8. So mathematically, if we use these numbers as their weights, the mean is correct.\n\nHowever, in reality, each athlete's actual weight could be lower than the category limit, which would make the true average lower than 65.8. But since the problem only provides the categories, not individual weights, we have to work with what's given.\n\nTherefore, based solely on the data provided (the event columns), calculating the mean as 65.8 kg is accurate. So the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table lists each athlete's weight category, which can be used to compute their mean weight if taken as actual weights. Calculating the average of these values gives exactly 65.8 kg.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It states that every athlete (competitor) is competing in the same weight category. So, all of them should be in one specific weight division, like all in flyweight or something similar.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five rows, each representing a different athlete. Each row has an 'event' column which indicates their weight class. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. Nariman Shakirov - Finweight (-54 kg)\n2. Zhalgas Bekkassymov - Flyweight (-58 kg)\n3.

Each athlete is in a different weight category.\n\nThe claim says they all compete in the same weight class. But here, each one is in their own distinct division.

The claim says: \"only 1 competitor from Kazakhstan advance to the quarterfinal or beyond.\" I need to check each row in the table to see how many athletes from Kazakhstan made it past the quarterfinals.\n\nFirst, looking at Row 1: Nariman Shakirov. He's in the finweight (-54 kg) event. In the round of 32, he won against Mateus Soares with points 19-5. Then in the round of 16, he lost to Aijaman Al-Ojaiman (Kuwait) with 4-6. The quarterfinals say \"did not advance,\" so he didn't go further than round of 16.\n\nRow 2: Zhalgas Bekkassymov in flyweight (-58 kg). He had a bye in the round of 32, then lost in the round of 16 to Pen-Ek Karket from Thailand with 3-4. So he didn't make it to quarterfinals either.\n\nRow 3: Darkhan Kassymkulov in bantamweight (-63 kg). He won in the round of 32 against Surendra Bhandari (Kuwait) with 8-7, then lost in the round of 16 to Jawad Lakzaee from Afghanistan with 5-10.

No quarterfinals here either.\n\nWait, but all these athletes are from Kazakhstan? The names like Shakirov, Bekkassymov, Kassymkulov, Dyussebayev, and Kassymov sound Kazakhstani.

It states that even the lightest athlete in the competition has a weight above 54 kg. So, my task is to find out the minimum weight among all athletes and check if it exceeds 54 kg.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an athlete with their respective weight categories. The event column specifies the weight class for each athlete. Here's how I can interpret this:\n\n1. Nariman Shakirov is in the finweight category of -54 kg. The \"-\" sign typically denotes that the weight limit is up to that number. So, finweight (-54 kg) means he weighs no more than 54 kg.\n\n2. Zhalgas Bekkassymov is in flyweight (-58 kg), which would mean his weight is up to 58 kg. Since this is higher than 54 kg, it doesn't affect the lightest competitor's status.\n\n3. Darkhan Kassymkulov competes in bantamweight (-63 kg), which is even heavier than the previous two categories.\n\n4. Aibar Dyussebayev is in lightweight (-74 kg) and Sultan Kassymov in welterweight (-80 kg), both of which are significantly higher weight classes.\n\nThe lightest competitor would be Nariman Shakirov since he's in the lowest weight category, finweight -54 kg. Therefore, his maximum possible weight is 54 kg or less. \n\nNow, evaluating the claim: \"the lightest competitor weighs more than 54 kilogram.\" If Nariman Shakirov is indeed the lightest and his weight is at most 54 kg, then the statement that he weighs more than 54 kg would be false.\n\nSo, the relevant cell to verify this is the event column for Nariman Shakirov in row 1.

To determine this, I should look for the highest weight class mentioned in the events because the heaviest competitor would be in the highest weight category.\n\nLooking at each row:\n- Nariman Shakirov is in the finweight (-54 kg) category.\n- Zhalgas Bekkassymov competes in flyweight (-58 kg).\n- Darkhan Kassymkulov is a bantamweight (-63 kg).\n- Aibar Dyussebayev is in lightweight (-74 kg).\n- Sultan Kassymov competes in welterweight (-80 kg).\n\nThe highest weight category here is welterweight, which is -80 kg. This means the upper limit for this category is 80 kg. The claim states that the heaviest competitor weighs less than 80 kg. Since the maximum allowed weight in the highest category is exactly 80 kg, I need to clarify whether the competitors actually weigh under or up to 80 kg.\n\nIn sports like boxing or wrestling, the weight categories usually specify a maximum weight. So a welterweight (-80 kg) competitor can weigh up to just below 80 kg (e.g., 79.9 kg). Therefore, all competitors in this category would indeed weigh less than 80 kg.\n\nThus, since the heaviest category is -80 kg and its participants are under that weight, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe table lists athletes in various weight categories, with the highest being welterweight (-80 kg). This means all competitors in this category weigh under 80 kg. Therefore, the heaviest competitor does weigh less than 80 kg.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"the mean weight of all competitor be less than 60 kilogram\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and understand what each row represents. Each row contains information about an athlete, including their event, which mentions a weight category. The events are listed as finweight (-54 kg), flyweight (-58 kg), bantamweight (-63 kg), lightweight (-74 kg), and welterweight (-80 kg). \n\nThe claim is about the mean (average) weight of all competitors being less than 60 kilograms. To verify this, I need to extract each athlete's weight category from their respective events.\n\nLooking at each row:\n1. Nariman Shakirov - finweight (-54 kg)\n2. Zhalgas Bekkassymov - flyweight (-58 kg)\n3. Darkhan Kassymkulov - bantamweight (-63 kg)\n4. Aibar Dyussebayev - lightweight (-74 kg)\n5. Sultan Kassymov - welterweight (-80 kg)\n\nNow, I'll list out the weights: 54kg, 58kg, 63kg, 74kg, and 80kg.\n\nCalculating the mean:\nMean = (54 + 58 + 63 + 74 + 80) / 5\nLet's add them up:\n54 + 58 = 112\n112 + 63 = 175\n175 + 74 = 249\n249 + 80 = 329\n\nSo, total weight is 329kg. Dividing by the number of athletes (5):\nMean = 329 / 5 = 65.8 kg.\n\nThe mean weight is 65.8 kg, which is more than 60 kg. Therefore, the claim that the mean weight is less than 60 kg is FALSE.\n\nTo support this, I need to identify the relevant cells in the table that were used for the calculation. Each athlete's event includes their weight category, so each row contributes a cell from the 'event' column.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 1, Column: event\n- Row 2, Column: event\n- Row 3, Column: event\n- Row 4, Column: event\n- Row 5, Column: event\n\nThese are the five events with their respective weight categories used to compute the mean.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
