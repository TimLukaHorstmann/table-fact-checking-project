    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"warren kym perform 16 dance\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"warren kym.\" Looking at the table, the couples are listed in the \"couple\" column. Scanning through the rows, I see Row 2 has \"warren & kym\" as the couple. So that's the relevant row for this part of the claim.\n\nNext, the claim says they \"perform 16 dance.\" The table includes a column called \"number of dances,\" which shows how many dances each couple performed. In Row 2, under \"number of dances,\" it's listed as 16. That matches exactly with what the claim states.\n\nSo putting it together: the couple \"warren & kym\" is in Row 2, and their number of dances is indeed 16. Therefore, the claim is accurate based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly identifies that Warren & Kym performed 16 dances as shown in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"couple\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"number of dances\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "rocco karina score 89 point in 5 dance , for an average of 17.8",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to determine if the claim \"rocco karina score 89 point in 5 dance , for an average of 17.8\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided. Each row has several columns: rank by average, place, couple, total points, number of dances, and average. The rows are indexed from 1 to 12, but in programming terms, we often start counting from 0, so I need to be careful about that.\n\nThe claim mentions \"rocco karina\". Looking through the 'couple' column, I see that Row 11 lists them as \"rocco & karina\". So their row is number 11 if starting from 1 or index 10 in zero-based terms. Wait, actually, looking at the table provided:\n\nRow 1: couple: brooke & derek\n...\nRow 11: couple: rocco & karina\n\nSo in this context, rows are numbered starting at 1, so Row 11 is the 11th row.\n\nNow, checking their total points. The claim says they scored 89 points. Let's look at Row 11: total points are indeed 89. That matches.\n\nNext, the number of dances. The claim states it's 5 dances. In Row 11, the 'number of dances' is 5, so that also aligns.\n\nLastly, the average score claimed is 17.8. Looking at Row 11, the average column shows 17.8, which matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nSo all parts of the claim\u2014couple name, total points, number of dances, and average\u2014are correctly represented in Row 11 of the table. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because all details match the corresponding row in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"couple\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"total points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"number of dances\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"average\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"cody & julianne's average score be 22.5\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding the structure of the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: rank by average, place, couple name, total points, number of dances, and average. The claim is about Cody & Julianne's average score being 22.5. \n\nFirst, I should find the row where the couple is \"cody & julianne\". Scanning through the rows:\n\nRow 1: Brooke & Derek\nRow 2: Warren & Kym\nRow 3: Lance & Lacey\nRow 4: Maurice & Cheryl\nRow 5: Cody & Julianne \u2013 Yes, that's the one.\nRow 6 onwards: Others.\n\nSo row 5 is where Cody & Julianne are. Now, I need to check their average score. In that same row, under the 'average' column, it says 22.5. That matches exactly with the claim. \n\nI should also make sure there's no other couple named Cody & Julianne in another row, but looking through all rows, it appears only once at row 5.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because the average score for Cody & Julianne as per the table is indeed 22.5.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Cody & Julianne's average is listed as 22.5 in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"average\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out if the claim \"there be more than 20 dance warren & kym have do together\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The rows are numbered from 1 to 12, each containing information about different couples, their ranks, places, total points, number of dances, and averages.\n\nThe claim is about Warren & Kym. So I need to find their row in the table. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Brooke & Derek\n- Row 2: Warren & Kym \u2013 this must be the relevant row.\n\nIn row 2, the columns are: rank by average (2), place (2), couple name (Warren & Kym), total points (397), number of dances (16), and average (24.8).\n\nThe claim says they have done more than 20 dances together. So I need to check the \"number of dances\" column for Warren & Kym.\n\nLooking at row 2, the number of dances is 16. \n\nSince 16 is less than 20, the claim that they've done more than 20 dances is false.\n\nNow, I should note the relevant cells used to determine this. The \"number of dances\" column in row 2 is where the information about how many dances they've performed together is located.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Warren & Kym have performed more than 20 dances together.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim. It states that the average score for the couple Cody & Julianne is 22.3. My task is to check this against the provided table data.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has information about different couples, including their rank, place, total points, number of dances, and average. I need to find the row where the couple's name is Cody & Julianne.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Brooke & Derek\n- Row 2: Warren & Kym\n- Row 3: Lance & Lacey\n- Row 4: Maurice & Cheryl\n- Row 5: Cody & Julianne - This is the couple we're looking for.\n  \nNow, in Row 5, let's check the average. The column for average shows 22.5. The claim says 22.3, which doesn't match.\n\nSo, the average according to the table is 22.5, not 22.3. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nI'll also note the relevant cells: Row 5's average column and perhaps their name for confirmation, but since the question specifically asks about the average, I can focus on that cell.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states Cody & Julianne have an average of 22.3, but the table shows 22.5.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"average\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
