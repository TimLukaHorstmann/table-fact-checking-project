    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the home team only score zero 3 times out of all games\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim says that the home team scored zero goals three times in all the games listed. That means I need to look through each row of the table and count how many times the home team's score was zero.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\nEach row has:\n- tie no: indicates whether it's a regular match or a replay.\n- home team: the name of the home team.\n- score: shows two numbers, presumably goals by home and away teams. The first number is the home team's score, the second is the away team's.\n- away team: the opposing team.\n- attendance: not relevant for this claim.\n\nSo my main focus is on the \"score\" column to see how many times the home team scored zero.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1:\n- Score: 1 - 1. Home team (liverpool) scored 1. Not zero.\n\nRow 2:\n- This is a replay tie, so it's another match between the same teams but at the away team's home.\n- Score: 1 - 0. Home team here is portsmouth, they scored 1. So not zero.\n\nWait, no. Wait, row 2 is a replay, so I think each row represents a separate game, regardless of tie number. So even replays are considered as games where the home team might have scored zero.\n\nRow 3:\n- Score: 1 - 1. Home team sunderland scored 1. Not zero.\n\nRow 4:\n- Another replay.\n- Score: 0 - 2. Home team is birmingham city, they scored 0 here. So that's one instance where the home team scored zero.\n\nRow 5:\n- Score: 1 - 0. Home team sheffield united scored 1. Not zero.\n\nRow 6:\n- Score: 2 - 1. Home team tranmere rovers scored 2. Not zero.\n\nRow 7:\n- Score: 0 - 0. Both teams didn't score. So home team fulham scored 0 here. That's the second instance.\n\nRow 8:\n- Another replay.\n- Score: 0 - 3. Home team west ham united scored 0. Third instance.\n\nRow 9:\n- Score: 4 - 2. Home team manchester united scored 4. Not zero.\n\nRow 10:\n- Score: 1 - 0. Home team millwall scored 1. Not zero.\n\nRow 11:\n- Score: 2 - 1. Home team arsenal scored 2. Not zero.\n\nSo, counting the instances where the home team scored zero:\n\n- Row 4: birmingham city (home) vs sunderland (away), score 0-2.\n- Row 7: fulham (home) vs west ham united (away), score 0-0.\n- Row 8: west ham united (home) vs fulham (away), score 0-3.\n\nThat's three instances where the home team scored zero. The claim says exactly that: \"only 3 times.\" So, according to my count, the claim is TRUE.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check each row to make sure I didn't miss anything or miscount.\n\nRows 1 through 11:\n\n- Rows with home score 0:\n   - Row 4: yes.\n   - Row 7: yes.\n   - Row 8: yes.\n\nNo others. So that's three times, which matches the claim exactly.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are in rows 4, 7, and 8 under the \"score\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as there are three instances where the home team scored zero goals. The relevant scores from the table support this count.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the manchester unite vs manchester city game have the highest attendance of all game\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided in naturalized format. It has several rows with details about different matches, including tie numbers, home and away teams, scores, and attendances.\n\nThe claim mentions \"manchester unite vs manchester city,\" which seems like a typo for \"Manchester United vs Manchester City.\" So, I should check if there's a match between these two teams in the table. Looking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Liverpool vs Portsmouth\n- Row 2: Portsmouth vs Liverpool (replay)\n- Row 3: Sunderland vs Birmingham City\n- Row 4: Birmingham City vs Sunderland (replay)\n- Row 5: Sheffield United vs Colchester United\n- Row 6: Tranmere Rovers vs Swansea City\n- Row 7: Fulham vs West Ham United\n- Row 8: West Ham United vs Fulham (replay)\n- Row 9: Manchester United vs Manchester City\n- Row 10: Millwall vs Burnley\n- Row 11: Arsenal vs Chelsea\n\nOkay, so the match between Manchester United and Manchester City is in row 9. The attendance for that game is listed as 67228.\n\nNow, I need to verify if this is indeed the highest attendance among all the games listed. Let's go through each row's attendance:\n\n1. Row 1: 34669\n2. Row 2: 19529\n3. Row 3: 24966\n4. Row 4: 25645\n5. Row 5: 17074\n6. Row 6: 12215\n7. Row 7: 14705\n8. Row 8: 27934\n9. Row 9: 67228\n10. Row 10: 10420\n11. Row 11: 38136\n\nLooking at these numbers, row 9 has the highest attendance by far with 67,228 attendees. The next highest is row 11 (Arsenal vs Chelsea) with 38,136, which is significantly lower than 67,228.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Manchester United vs Manchester City had the highest attendance is true based on this table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the attendance for the Manchester United vs. Manchester City game (row 9) is the highest at 67,228 compared to all other games in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"tie no 7 have the lowest attendance out of all feature game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim refers to \"tie no 7\" and claims that it has the \"lowest attendance.\" So, my goal is to find out if tie number 7 indeed has the lowest attendance among all the ties listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure provided, there are multiple rows, each representing a different tie. Each row contains details like tie no, home team, score, away team, and attendance. The table has rows from 1 to 8 under \"tie no,\" with some having replays as well. However, the claim specifically mentions \"tie no 7,\" so I need to focus on that.\n\nI'll start by identifying all the ties in the table. From row indices 0 to 8 (since JSON is zero-indexed), each row has a \"tie no\" value. Let's list them out:\n\n- Row 0: tie no: 1\n- Row 1: tie no: replay\n- Row 2: tie no: 2\n- Row 3: tie no: replay\n- Row 4: tie no: 3\n- Row 5: tie no: 4\n- Row 6: tie no: 5\n- Row 7: tie no: replay\n- Row 8: tie no: 6\n- Row 9: tie no: 7\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, the table as given has rows from 1 to 11 in naturalized format. Let me recount:\n\nRow 1: tie no:1\nRow 2: tie no: replay (tie no is \"replay,\" so not a number)\nRow 3: tie no:2\nRow 4: tie no: replay\nRow 5: tie no:3\nRow 6: tie no:4\nRow7: tie no:5\nRow8: tie no: replay\nRow9: tie no:6\nRow10: tie no:7\nRow11: tie no:8\n\nSo, in JSON terms (zero-indexed), the rows would be:\n\n0: tie no 1\n1: replay\n2: tie no2\n3: replay\n4: tie no3\n5: tie no4\n6: tie no5\n7: replay\n8: tie no6\n9: tie no7\n10: tie no8\n\nWait, the user provided rows 1 to 11 in naturalized format. So when converting to JSON, the row indices would be from 0 to 10.\n\nSo, the \"tie no\" values for each row are:\n\nRow 0 (natural row 1): tie no:1\nRow1: replay\nRow2: tie no:2\nRow3: replay\nRow4: tie no:3\nRow5: tie no:4\nRow6: tie no:5\nRow7: replay\nRow8: tie no:6\nRow9: tie no:7\nRow10: tie no:8\n\nSo, the claim is about \"tie no 7,\" which corresponds to row index 9 in JSON terms.\n\nNow, I need to check the attendance for each tie. The claim says that tie no7 has the lowest attendance. So, I have to compare the attendance of tie7 with all other ties (excluding replays since the claim refers to \"feature game,\" which might mean regular games not replays).\n\nWait, but the table includes both regular ties and replays. Does the claim consider replays as part of the feature games? The wording is a bit unclear. But given that the claim says \"all feature game,\" I think it's referring to all the main matches, including replays. Alternatively, maybe just the initial matches.\n\nBut perhaps it's safer to consider all rows except the replays when determining the lowest attendance among regular ties. Or perhaps the claim is considering all games, including replays. However, let me look at the attendances:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow0: tie1, attendance 34669\nRow1: replay, attendance 19529\nRow2: tie2, attendance 24966\nRow3: replay, attendance25645\nRow4: tie3, attendance17074\nRow5: tie4, attendance12215\nRow6: tie5, attendance14705\nRow7: replay, attendance27934\nRow8: tie6, attendance67228 (Manchester United vs City)\nRow9: tie7, attendance10420 (Millwall vs Burnley)\nRow10: tie8, attendance38136\n\nNow, the claim is about tie no7. From row9, tie7 has attendance 10420.\n\nI need to check if this is indeed the lowest among all feature games. Let's list the attendances for each tie:\n\ntie1: 34669\ntie2:24966\ntie3:17074\ntie4:12215\ntie5:14705\ntie6:67228\ntie7:10420\ntie8:38136\n\nNow, looking at these numbers:\n\nThe lowest attendance is 10420 for tie7. The next lowest are tie4 (12215), then tie5 (14705), tie3 (17074), etc.\n\nSo yes, tie7 has the lowest attendance among all ties listed.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"tie no 7\" has the lowest attendance. By examining each row, we find that tie number 7 indeed has the lowest attendance of 10,420 compared to all other ties in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"tie no 1 be the game tie score game with the highest attendance\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It seems a bit convoluted, but I think it means that the game corresponding to Tie No. 1 has the highest attendance among all the games listed in the table. So, my task is to check if the attendance for Tie No. 1 is indeed the highest.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are 11 rows of data. Each row represents a different tie or replay game with details like home team, score, away team, and attendance. The first thing I should do is locate all the rows that mention \"tie no: 1\" because the claim refers to Tie No. 1.\n\nScanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Tie No: 1\n- Row 2: Tie No: replay (related to Tie No:1)\n- Rows 3 and 4 are about Tie No: 2 and its replay.\n- Similarly, other rows go up to Tie No:8.\n\nSo, for the main ties without replays, we have Tie Nos from 1 to 8. Each of these has an attendance figure associated with them.\n\nNow, focusing on Tie No. 1 in Row 1: The attendance is 34,669. I'll note this down as a candidate for the highest.\n\nNext, I need to check all other main ties (Tie Nos 2-8) and their attendances to see if any have higher numbers than 34,669.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Attendance 34,669\nRow 3: Attendance 24,966\nRow 5: Attendance 17,074\nRow 6: Attendance 12,215\nRow 7: Attendance 14,705\nRow 9: Attendance 67,228 (Tie No:6)\nRow 10: Attendance 10,420\nRow 11: Attendance 38,136\n\nWait a minute, Row 9 is for Tie No:6 with an attendance of 67,228. That's higher than 34,669.\n\nSo, according to this, Tie No:6 has the highest attendance so far in the main ties. But I should also check if there are any replays that have higher attendances because sometimes replies might draw more people, especially if it's a high-profile game.\n\nLooking at the replay rows:\n\nRow 2: Attendance 19,529 (replay of Tie No:1)\nRow 4: Attendance 25,645 (replay of Tie No:2)\nRow 8: Attendance 27,934 (replay of Tie No:5)\n\nThe highest attendance in replays is 27,934, which is still less than 67,228.\n\nTherefore, the game with the highest attendance is Tie No:6 at 67,228. This means that the claim that Tie No.1 has the highest attendance is incorrect.\n\nWait a second, but the user's table might have been misrepresented in my analysis. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking back at the rows:\n\nRow 9: tie no: 6, home team: manchester united, score:4-2, away team: manchester city, attendance:67228.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Tie No:6 has higher attendance than Tie No:1.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Tie No.1 doesn't have the highest attendance; Tie No.6 does.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}",

The claim states: \"both the arsenal and chelsea team be only feature on the list a single time.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what this means. It seems like it's saying that both Arsenal and Chelsea appear exactly once in the list. I'll need to check each row of the table to see how many times each team appears.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Home team is Liverpool, away is Portsmouth.\nRow 2: Home is Portsmouth, away is Liverpool (replay).\nRow 3: Home is Sunderland, away is Birmingham City.\nRow 4: Home is Birmingham City, away is Sunderland (replay).\nRow 5: Home is Sheffield United, away is Colchester United.\nRow 6: Home is Tranmere Rovers, away is Swansea City.\nRow 7: Home is Fulham, away is West Ham United.\nRow 8: Home is West Ham United, away is Fulham (replay).\nRow 9: Home is Manchester United, away is Manchester City. Oh, wait, this row has both Manchester teams. But the claim is about Arsenal and Chelsea, so I can note that but it's not directly relevant yet.\nRow 10: Home is Millwall, away is Burnley.\nRow 11: Home is Arsenal, away is Chelsea.\n\nNow, looking for Arsenal and Chelsea:\n\n- Arsenal appears in row 11 as the home team. Is there any other mention of Arsenal? Checking all rows, it only appears once.\n- Similarly, Chelsea appears in row 11 as the away team. Any other occurrence? No, just once.\n\nSo both teams appear exactly once each on the list. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells are where Arsenal and Chelsea are listed: row 11 for both home (Arsenal) and away (Chelsea).\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Still good.\n\nRow 3: Sunderland at home, score 1-1. So they scored 1. No problem.\n\nRow 4: Replay between Birmingham City and Sunderland. Score is 0-2. Wait, the home team here is Birmingham City, and their score is 0. That means they didn't score any goals. This would mean the claim is false because the home team did score zero points in this game.\n\nRow 5: Sheffield United at home, scored 1. No issue.\n\nRow 6: Tranmere Rovers scored 2.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's figure out if the claim \"tie no 7 have the highest attendance out of all feature game\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It claims that tie number 7 has the highest attendance compared to all other games listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different tie with various details including attendance. The rows are numbered from 1 to 8, and there are also some replays (repeats of previous ties because the initial match was tied).\n\nI'll go through each relevant cell step by step:\n\n1. **Identify all attendances**: To determine which tie has the highest attendance, I need to look at the 'attendance' column for every row.\n\n   - Row 1: 34669\n   - Row 2: 19529\n   - Row 3: 24966\n   - Row 4: 25645\n   - Row 5: 17074\n   - Row 6: 12215\n   - Row 7: 14705\n   - Row 8: 27934\n   - Row 9: 67228\n   - Row 10: 10420\n   - Row 11: 38136\n\n2. **Identify the attendance for Tie No 7**: Looking at row 7, the attendance is 14705.\n\n3. **Compare with other attendances**: Now, I need to check if any other tie has a higher attendance than 14705.\n\n   - The highest attendance in the table is 67228 for Tie No 9 (Manchester United vs Manchester City).\n   - Other high attendances include Row 1:34669, Row 8:27934, and Row 11:38136.\n\nSince Tie No 7's attendance is 14705, which is less than several other ties, including Tie No 9 with 67228, the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because another tie (Tie No 9) has a higher attendance.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "tie no 1 be the game with the second highest attendance",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"tie no 1 be the game with the second highest attendance.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. Tie no 1 refers to the first match in the table, which is Row 1. The home team is Liverpool, and the away team is Portsmouth with an attendance of 34669.\n\nNext, I have to determine if this attendance is the second highest among all the games listed. To do that, I'll look at the attendance numbers from each row:\n\n- Row 1: 34669\n- Row 2: 19529\n- Row 3: 24966\n- Row 4: 25645\n- Row 5: 17074\n- Row 6: 12215\n- Row 7: 14705\n- Row 8: 27934\n- Row 9: 67228\n- Row 10: 10420\n- Row 11: 38136\n\nNow, I'll sort these attendance figures to identify the highest and second-highest. \n\nLooking at them:\n\nRow 9 has the highest attendance with 67228.\n\nNext, the other attendances are:\n\n38136 (Row 11), 34669 (Row 1), 27934 (Row 8), 25645 (Row 4), 24966 (Row 3), 19529 (Row 2), 17074 (Row 5), 14705 (Row 7), 12215 (Row 6), and 10420 (Row 10).\n\nArranged in descending order, after Row 9's 67228, the next highest is Row 11 with 38136. Then comes Row 1 with 34669.\n\nSo, the second-highest attendance is actually from Row 11 (tie no 8), not tie no 1. Therefore, tie no 1 has the third-highest attendance, which means it's not the second highest as claimed.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because tie no 1 isn't the game with the second highest attendance; instead, tie no 8 has that distinction.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that tie number 1 has the second-highest attendance. By examining all rows, the attendances are sorted to identify the top two. The highest is in row 9 (67228), and the next highest is row 11 (38136). Therefore, tie no 1 is third, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"both the arsenal and chelsea team be only feature on the list more than 1 time.\" So, I need to check if both Arsenal and Chelsea appear in the table more than once.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see where Arsenal or Chelsea are mentioned as either home or away teams.\n\nLooking at Row 8: Tie no: replay, Home team: West Ham United, Away team: Fulham. Neither Arsenal nor Chelsea here.\n\nRow 9: Tie no:6, Home team: Manchester United, Away team: Manchester City. Again, not relevant.\n\nRow 10: Tie no:7, Home team: Millwall, Away team: Burnley. Nope.\n\nRow 11: Tie no:8, Home team: Arsenal, Away team: Chelsea. So here, both Arsenal and Chelsea are featured once each in the same row. \n\nNow, I'll check if either of them appears again in any other rows beyond this one instance. Scanning through all rows from 1 to 11:\n\nRow 1: Liverpool vs Portsmouth.\n\nRow 2: Portsmouth replay vs Liverpool.\n\nRows 3 and 4: Sunderland vs Birmingham City.\n\nRow 5: Sheffield United vs Colchester United.\n\nRow 6: Tranmere Rovers vs Swansea City.\n\nRow 7: Fulham vs West Ham United (replay).\n\nSo, the only row where either Arsenal or Chelsea appear is Row 11. Therefore, both teams are each featured once in the table, not more than once as the claim suggests.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because neither Arsenal nor Chelsea appear more than once.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
