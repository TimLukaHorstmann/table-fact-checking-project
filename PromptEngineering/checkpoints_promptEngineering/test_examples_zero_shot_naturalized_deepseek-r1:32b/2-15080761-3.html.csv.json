    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says, \"small health be the opponent of manchester unite in the first 4 game of the fa cup.\" So, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table shows. It looks like it's a list of matches Manchester United played in the FA Cup. Each row represents a different match with details like date, round, opponents, home/away status, result, and attendance.\n\nThe claim mentions \"the first 4 game,\" which I think means the first four games they played in the FA Cup. So I should look at the first four rows of the table to see who their opponents were.\n\nLooking at Row 1: The opponent is small heath, and it's the intermediate round. That's one match.\nRow 2: Also against small heath, but it's a replay. Since replays are part of the same initial game in FA Cup terms, this might still count as the first game or maybe not depending on how rounds work.\nRow 3: Another replay against small heath. So that's still within the intermediate round.\nRow 4: Now they're playing against small heath again for a third replay. This would be part of their progression through the same initial match.\n\nBut wait, when you have replays in football tournaments, each replay is considered an additional game if needed to decide the winner. So in this case, Manchester United played four matches against Small Heath across multiple replays before moving on to Round 1 against Notts County in Row 5.\n\nSo for the first four games, their opponent was indeed Small Heath. Each of these matches (Rows 1-4) is a game against Small Heath in different replays or rounds.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"small health be the opponent of manchester unite in the first 4 game\" seems to hold true based on the table provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Manchester United's opponents for their first four FA Cup games were Small Heath. Checking rows 1 through 4 of the table confirms each match was against Small Heath across different rounds and replays.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The key points here are:\n\n1. There are four games played against Small Heath.\n2. Out of these four games, three resulted in a 1-1 scoreline.\n\nI'll start by identifying all the rows where the opponent is Small Heath. Looking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Opponents - small heath\nRow 2: Opponents - small heath\nRow 3: Opponents - small heath\nRow 4: Opponents - small heath\n\nSo, there are four matches against Small Heath as stated in the claim.\n\nNext, I'll check the result of each match to see if it's 1-1.\n\nRow 1: Result f-a is 1-1\nRow 2: Result f-a is 1-1\nRow 3: Result f-a is 1-1\nRow 4: Result f-a is 3-1\n\nSo, out of four matches against Small Heath:\n\n- Rows 1, 2, and 3 have a result of 1-1.\n- Row 4 has a different result (3-1).\n\nThis means three games resulted in 1-1 draws, which aligns with the claim. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells from the table:\n\nFor each row where the opponent is Small Heath and the result is 1-1:\n\n- Row 1: \"opponents\" and \"result f - a\"\n- Row 2: \"opponents\" and \"result f - a\"\n- Row 3: \"opponents\" and \"result f - a\"\n\nRow 4 isn't included because its result is different, so it's not part of the three that resulted in 1-1.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\nRow indices 0 (Row 1), 1 (Row 2), and 2 (Row 3) with columns \"opponents\" and \"result f - a\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result f - a\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result f - a\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result f - a\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that only the last three games listed in the table had an attendance exceeding 10,000 people. So, I need to check the attendance numbers for all seven rows and see if this holds true.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Attendance is 10,000.\nRow 2: Attendance is 5,000.\nRow 3: Attendance is 3,000.\nRow 4: Attendance is 9,372.\nRow 5: Attendance is 12,000.\nRow 6: Attendance is 18,000.\nRow 7: Attendance is 22,051.\n\nThe claim mentions \"only the last three games.\" So, let's identify which rows are considered the last three. Since there are seven rows in total, rows 5, 6, and 7 are the fifth, sixth, and seventh entries. \n\nNow, checking each of these:\n\n- Row 5: 12,000 (over 10,000)\n- Row 6: 18,000 (over 10,000)\n- Row 7: 22,051 (over 10,000)\n\nSo, all three of these have attendances over 10,000. But I need to ensure that no other rows besides these last three have attendance over 10,000.\n\nLooking at the earlier rows:\n\n- Row 1: Exactly 10,000. The claim says \"over,\" so this doesn't count.\n- Rows 2 and 3: Below 10,000.\n- Row 4: 9,372, which is just under 10,000.\n\nSo far, only rows 5,6,7 are over 10,000. That seems to support the claim.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure there isn't a game outside these last three with attendance over 10,000. Checking all rows again:\n\nRows 1: 10k, not over.\nRow 2: 5k\nRow3: 3k\nRow4:9,372\nRow5:12k\nRow6:18k\nRow7:22k.\n\nSo yes, only the last three have attendances above 10,000.

I need to determine whether the claim \"the wednesday only appear as an opponent 1 time , during the last game of the fc season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each part of the claim is saying. The two main points are:\n\n1. **Opponent Frequency**: The Wednesday appears as an opponent only once.\n2. **Timing in Season**: This single appearance happens during the last game of the FC season.\n\nTo verify these claims, I need to examine the table provided and look for relevant data points.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Opponents**\n\nLooking at each row's \"opponents\" column:\n\n- Row 1: Small Heath\n- Row 2: Small Heath\n- Row 3: Small Heath\n- Row 4: Small Heath\n- Row 5: Notts County\n- Row 6: Notts County\n- Row 7: The Wednesday\n\nSo, The Wednesday only appears once in the opponents column, which supports the first part of the claim.\n\n**Step 2: Determine if it's the Last Game**\n\nNext, I need to check if this game was indeed the last one played. For that, I'll look at the dates of each match:\n\n- Row 1: 12 December 1903\n- Row 2: 16 December 1903\n- Row 3: 21 December 1903\n- Row 4: 11 January 1904\n- Row 5: 6 February 1904\n- Row 6: 10 February 1904\n- Row 7: 20 February 1904\n\nArranged in chronological order, the last date is 20 February 1904, which corresponds to Row 7. This row shows The Wednesday as opponents, confirming that they appeared in the last game of the season.\n\n**Step 3: Double-Check for Any Other Appearances**\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll scan through all rows again to ensure there are no other instances of The Wednesday. Rows 1-6 don't list them, so it's clear their only appearance is in Row 7.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth parts of the claim hold true: The Wednesday appear as opponents only once, and this occurs during the last game of the season.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"the highest attendance of the manchester unite fc season be on 10 february , 1904.\" Hmm, wait a minute\u2014I notice that the team mentioned in the table is \"Manchester United FC\"? Or maybe it's just \"Manchester Utd\"? Let me check the opponents and other details to make sure. Looking at the table rows, I see entries for Small Heath, Notts County, The Wednesday. So, perhaps this is about Manchester United's season.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the highest attendance on 10 February 1904. To verify this, I need to look through each row in the table and check the dates and attendances. Let me go step by step.\n\nRow 1: Date is December 12, 1903; opponents are Small Heath at home; attendance is 10,000.\nRow 2: Dec 16, 1903; same opponents but away; attendance 5,000.\nRow 3: Dec 21, 1903; intermediate round 2nd replay at Bramall Lane (which I think is Manchester's ground); attendance 3,000.\nRow 4: Jan 11, 1904; intermediate round 3rd replay at Hyde Road; attendance 9,372.\nRow 5: Feb 6, 1904; Round 1 against Notts County away; attendance 12,000.\nRow 6: Feb 10, 1904; Round 1 replay at home; attendance 18,000. This is the date mentioned in the claim.\nRow 7: Feb 20, 1904; Round 2 against The Wednesday away; attendance 22,051.\n\nWait, hold on! Row 7 has an attendance of 22,051 which is higher than the 18,000 in row 6. So if that's the case, then the highest attendance isn't on February 10 but rather on February 20. Therefore, the claim would be FALSE because there's a higher attendance later in the season.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. The claim is about the \"highest\" attendance of the entire season. Looking at all attendances:\n\n- 10k, 5k, 3k, ~9.4k, 12k, 18k, 22k.\n\nSo yes, 22k is higher than any other. Therefore, the highest attendance was on Feb 20, not Feb 10 as claimed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the highest attendance was on February 10, 1904, but the table shows a higher attendance of 22,051 on February 20, 1904.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that Notts County was Manchester United's opponent in the first four games of the FA Cup. I'll need to check if all these initial matches were against Notts County.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a game with details like date, round, opponents, home/away status, result, and attendance. The rounds mentioned are \"intermediate round,\" its replays, then \"round 1\" and so on.\n\nThe claim refers to the first four games, so I should look at the earliest entries in the table. Let's examine each row:\n\nRow 1: Date is 12 December 1903, opponents are Small Heath. Round is intermediate round.\nRow 2: 16 December 1903, same opponents Small Heath, but it's a replay.\nRow 3: 21 December 1903, again Small Heath, third replay at Bramall Lane.\nRow 4: 11 January 1904, still intermediate round 3rd replay against Small Heath, result is 3-1.\n\nSo the first four games (Rows 1 to 4) are all against Small Heath. The opponents listed as Notts County appear in Rows 5 and 6:\n\nRow 5: 6 February 1904, Round 1, opponents Notts County.\nRow 6: 10 February 1904, Round 1 replay.\n\nThus, the first four games are against Small Heath, not Notts County. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because it incorrectly states that Notts County was the opponent in the first four games instead of Small Heath.\n\nNow, I'll identify the relevant cells to verify this. For each game (rows 1-4), we need to check who the opponents were:\n\nRow 1: Opponents column.\nRow 2: Opponents column.\nRow 3: Opponents column.\nRow 4: Opponents column.\n\nSo all four rows have \"Small Heath\" as opponents, not Notts County.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"2 out of 4 game play against small heath result in 1 - 1 draw.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse what this means. It's talking about games played against a team called Small Heath, specifically four games where two resulted in a 1-1 draw.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are seven rows, each representing a game with different details like date, round, opponents, home/away status, result, and attendance.\n\nI need to focus on the rows where the opponent is Small Heath. Let me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Opponents are Small Heath, result is 1-1.\nRow 2: Opponents are Small Heath again, result also 1-1.\nRow 3: Still Small Heath, same result.\nRow 4: Another game against Small Heath with a different result, 3-1.\nRows 5 to 7: The opponents here are Notts County and The Wednesday, so not relevant.\n\nSo, from rows 1 to 4, all have Small Heath as the opponent. That makes four games in total. Now, checking the results:\n\nRow 1: 1-1 draw\nRow 2: 1-1 draw\nRow 3: 1-1 draw\nRow 4: 3-1 (a win for our team)\n\nSo out of four games against Small Heath, three resulted in a 1-1 draw and one was a win. The claim states that two out of four were draws. But according to the table, it's actually three draws.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not accurate because it says two instead of three. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant for this verification. For each game against Small Heath, I looked at the 'opponents' column and the 'result f - a' column to check if they were 1-1 draws.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\nRow 1: opponents and result\nRow 2: opponents and result\nRow 3: opponents and result\nRow 4: opponents and result\n\nEach of these rows contributes to assessing whether the claim holds true. Since all four games are against Small Heath, each row is necessary for verifying how many ended in a draw.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that two out of four games against Small Heath resulted in a 1-1 draw.

Each row corresponds to a game with details like date, round, opponents, home/away status, result, and attendance.\n\nThe claim is about the attendance figures in the last two rows (rows 6 and 7) of the table. Specifically, it's saying that only these two games had attendances over 10,000.\n\nI should check each row's attendance:\n\n- Row 1: 10,000\n- Row 2: 5,000\n- Row 3: 3,000\n- Row 4: 9,372\n- Row 5: 12,000\n- Row 6: 18,000\n- Row 7: 22,051\n\nWait a second, row 5 has an attendance of 12,000 which is more than 10,000. So according to the table, there are three games with attendances over 10,000 (rows 1, 5, 6, and 7? No, wait row 1 is exactly 10,000. The claim says \"more than\" so it's 12,000 in row 5, which would make it over 10k.\n\nSo the last two rows (rows 6 and 7) are indeed both above 10,000. However, row 5 is also above 10,000. Therefore, the claim that \"only\" the last two have attendances over 10k is FALSE because row 5 is another game with attendance exceeding 10,000.\n\nWait no, let me recheck: The table has seven rows. Rows 5,6,7 are the last three games. So if I consider only the last two (rows 6 and 7), both have attendance over 10k. But row 5 is before that and also meets the condition. Therefore, the claim that \"only\" the last two have attendances over 10k is incorrect because there's another game in between that does too.\n\nSo my conclusion is that the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because while rows 6 and 7 both exceed 10,000 attendance, row 5 also meets this criterion. Thus, more than just the last two games have attendances over 10,000.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"the wednesday only appear as an opponent 1 time during the first game of the fc season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully. It states two main points:\n1. The Wednesday appears as an opponent only once.\n2. This occurrence happens during the first game of the FC season.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row represents a different match with details like date, round, opponents, home/away status, result, and attendance.\n\nI need to identify all instances where \"the wednesday\" is listed as an opponent. Let's go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Opponents are Small Heath.\n- Row 2: Opponents are Small Heath.\n- Row 3: Opponents are Small Heath.\n- Row 4: Opponents are Small Heath.\n- Row 5: Opponents are Notts County.\n- Row 6: Opponents are Notts County.\n- Row 7: Opponents are The Wednesday.\n\nSo, \"the wednesday\" appears only once as an opponent in Row 7. That matches the first part of the claim that they appear only once.\n\nNext, I need to check if this occurrence is during the first game of the FC season. To determine the order of the games, I'll look at the dates:\n\n- The earliest date is December 12, 1903 (Row 1).\n- Then December 16 (Row 2), December 21 (Row 3), January 11, 1904 (Row 4), February 6 (Row 5), February 10 (Row 6), and February 20 (Row 7).\n\nThe first game of the season would be the earliest date, which is Row 1 on December 12. The Wednesday's match is in Row 7 on February 20, which is clearly not the first game.\n\nTherefore, while \"the wednesday\" only appears once as an opponent, it's not during the first game of the season. This makes the claim FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states two things: that The Wednesday appear only once and that this was during the first game. Checking the table shows they appear once but in a later round, so the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
