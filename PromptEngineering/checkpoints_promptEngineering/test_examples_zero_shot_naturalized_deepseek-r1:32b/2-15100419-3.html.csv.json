    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this problem where I need to determine if a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"there be 1 pick that have an overall of 114\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It's saying there's exactly one pick in the table with an overall value of 114. So my task is to check each row in the table and see if any of them have an 'overall' column value equal to 114.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has seven rows, each representing a different pick in various rounds. Each row includes details like round number, pick number, overall pick number, name, position, and college.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- **Row 1**: The 'overall' value is 21. That's not 114.\n- **Row 2**: The 'overall' here is 50. Still not matching.\n- **Row 3**: This has an overall of 79. Nope, not 114 yet.\n- **Row 4**: Here, the 'overall' is listed as 114. Bingo! That's exactly what the claim is stating.\n- **Row 5**: The next row shows an overall pick number of 147. Not relevant here.\n- **Row 6**: This one has 184. Again, not matching.\n- **Row 7**: Finally, there's a 221. Still not what we're looking for.\n\nSo after checking all seven rows, only Row 4 matches the 'overall' value of 114. Since the claim specifies that there is exactly one such pick and we've found it in Row 4, the claim holds true.\n\nNow, to structure my answer as per the instructions, I need to provide a JSON object with two keys: \"answer\" and \"relevant_cells\". The \"answer\" should be either \"TRUE\" or \"FALSE\", all caps. Then, \"relevant_cells\" is a list of objects where each object has the \"row_index\" (which is 0-based) and the \"column_name\".\n\nIn this case, since Row 4 in the problem statement corresponds to row index 3 (because indexing starts at 0), and the relevant column is 'overall', the JSON should reflect that.\n\nSo putting it all together, the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cell is at row_index 3 and column_name \"overall\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It mentions Cornell College and a low pick number, specifically 18. So, I'm looking for an entry where the college is Cornell and the pick number is 18.\n\nLooking at the table row by row:\n\nRow 1: Notre Dame - doesn't match.\nRow 2: West Virginia - nope.\nRow 3: North Carolina - not it.\nRow 4: Cornell. Here's the college we're looking for. Let me check the pick number in this row. The pick is 18, and the overall pick is 114.\n\nSo, yes, Cornell has a pick of 18 in round 4. That matches exactly what the claim states. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cell is in Row 4 under the \"pick\" column.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_ cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n   ]\n}",

The claim states: \"Daimon Shelton, a fullback, have an overall of 184 and a pick of 21.\" \n\nFirst, I need to locate Daimon Shelton in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"there be 1 pick that have a overall more than 114\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll understand what each part of the claim means. The phrase \"there be 1 pick\" suggests that at least one row in the table meets the specified condition. The condition here is having an \"overall\" value greater than 114.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\n- There are seven rows, each representing a different player with details like round, pick number, overall position, name, position, and college.\n- Each row has an \"overall\" column which indicates their overall draft pick number. This is crucial for evaluating the claim.\n\nNext, I'll go through each row to check the \"overall\" value:\n\n1. Row 1: Overall = 21\n2. Row 2: Overall = 50\n3. Row 3: Overall = 79\n4. Row 4: Overall = 114\n5. Row 5: Overall = 147\n6. Row 6: Overall = 184\n7. Row 7: Overall = 221\n\nNow, I need to identify which rows have an overall pick number greater than 114.\n\n- Row 5: 147 > 114 \u2192 Yes\n- Row 6: 184 > 114 \u2192 Yes\n- Row 7: 221 > 114 \u2192 Yes\n\nSo, there are three picks (Rows 5, 6, and 7) with overall numbers exceeding 114. However, the claim states that \"there be 1 pick,\" meaning at least one such entry is sufficient to make the claim TRUE.\n\nAdditionally, I should ensure that I'm interpreting the claim correctly. The phrase \"have a overall more than 114\" is a bit ungrammatical but clearly means having an overall number greater than 114. Since multiple rows meet this condition, it's definitely TRUE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\n- For each row that meets the condition (Rows 5, 6, and 7), I need to note the \"overall\" column.\n  \nThus, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 5, Column: overall\n- Row 6, Column: overall\n- Row 7, Column: overall\n\nEach of these rows has an overall value greater than 114, supporting the claim.\n\nWait a moment\u2014hold on. The original claim says \"there be 1 pick,\" which is true because there are multiple picks (three in this case) with overall numbers exceeding 114. So, the answer should definitely be TRUE.\n\nTherefore, compiling this information:\n\n- Answer: TRUE\n- Relevant Cells: Rows 5, 6, and 7 in the \"overall\" column.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"fullback have an overall smaller than 184, and a pick of 21.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. The first condition is that for fullbacks, their overall number should be less than 184. The second condition is that they have a pick of exactly 21. So both conditions need to be satisfied for the claim to be TRUE.\n\nLooking at the table, I see seven rows with information about players. Each row has details like round, pick, overall, name, position, and college. My task is to check each relevant cell in these rows to verify the claim.\n\nI'll start by identifying which rows have a fullback as their position. Scanning through the 'position' column:\n\n- Row 1: defensive tackle\n- Row 2: cornerback\n- Row 3: linebacker\n- Row 4: defensive tackle\n- Row 5: tight end\n- Row 6: fullback\n- Row 7: linebacker\n\nOnly Row 6 has a position of fullback. So, this is the only row I need to check for both conditions.\n\nNow, let's look at the two conditions for this row:\n\n1. Overall smaller than 184: The overall value in Row 6 is 184. Wait, that's equal to 184, not smaller. So this condition isn't met.\n2. Pick of 21: The pick number in Row 6 is indeed 21.\n\nBut since the first condition fails (overall must be less than 184 but it's exactly 184), the claim isn't fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nAdditionally, I need to note which cells are relevant for this determination. The relevant columns are 'position' and 'overall' in Row 6 because we're checking if a fullback has an overall less than 184. Also, since we checked the pick number, that's another column but it met the condition. However, since both conditions must be true for the claim to hold, and one failed, it still results in FALSE.\n\nSo, compiling the relevant cells:\n- Row 6, 'position' because it tells us if it's a fullback.\n- Row 6, 'overall' to check against 184.\n- Row 6, 'pick' to verify the pick number.\n\nThese are all necessary to assess both conditions in the claim. Even though the pick condition was met, the overall wasn't less than 184, making the entire claim false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"the lowest pick number for cornell be 18 have an overall smaller than 114.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what this means. It seems like there are two parts here:\n\n1. Identify the player from Cornell.\n2. Check if their pick number and overall pick number meet the criteria.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row has details about players drafted in different rounds. Let's go through each row to find any player from Cornell.\n\nRow 4: round 4, pick 18, overall 114, name Seth Payne, position defensive tackle, college Cornell. That's the only player from Cornell listed here.\n\nThe claim says \"the lowest pick number for cornell be 18\". Since there's only one player from Cornell, his pick number is 18 in round 4. So that part checks out because there are no other players from Cornell to compare pick numbers with; he's the only one.\n\nNext, the claim mentions \"have an overall smaller than 114.\" The overall pick number for Seth Payne is 114. Wait, so the claim says it should be smaller than 114. But in this case, it's exactly 114, not less than.\n\nTherefore, even though the pick number is correct (18), the overall isn't smaller than 114\u2014it's equal to it. So the second condition of the claim isn't met.\n\nSo putting it together: The lowest pick for Cornell is indeed 18, but his overall is not smaller than 114; it's exactly 114. Hence, the entire claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
