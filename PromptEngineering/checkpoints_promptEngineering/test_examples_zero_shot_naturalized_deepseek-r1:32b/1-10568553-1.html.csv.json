Milepost and roads intersected are marked as \"(no major junctions)\", same for notes.\n- **Rows 3-5**: These are in Plymouth County (Rockland and Hanover), but none mention Anne Street.\n\nSo, Anne Street is only listed in Row 2, which is in Norfolk county, not Plymouth.

Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, let's look at the structure of the table. There are five rows with various columns: county, location, street names, milepost, roads intersected, and notes. The claim mentions Plymouth County having two locations: Rockland and Stoughton. I'll check which rows belong to Plymouth County.\n\nLooking at each row:\n- Row 1: County is Norfolk.\n- Row 2: County is Norfolk.\n- Rows 3, 4, 5: All have county as Plymouth.\n\nSo, the relevant data for Plymouth County are rows 3, 4, and 5. Now, let's check their locations:\n- Row 3: Location Rockland\n- Row 4: Location Rockland (same as row 3)\n- Row 5: Location Hanover\n\nThe claim states that Plymouth County has two locations: Rockland and Stoughton. But in the table, under Plymouth County, the only location mentioned is Rockland three times and Hanover once. There's no mention of Stoughton in any Plymouth County rows.\n\nWait, looking back at Row 1: it's in Norfolk County, location Stoughton. So Stoughton isn't part of Plymouth County according to this table. The claim incorrectly includes Stoughton as a location in Plymouth County when it's actually in Norfolk.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Plymouth County only has Rockland and Hanover (but Hanover was not mentioned by the claim), but importantly, Stoughton isn't in Plymouth County based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly lists locations for Plymouth County.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions two main points: the location (Hanover in Plymouth County) and whether it intersects Route 123. I'll need to check each of these against the table entries.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five rows. Each row has information about county, location, street names, milepost, roads intersected, and notes. My task is to find if any row matches both Hanover in Plymouth County and mentions an intersection with Route 123.\n\nStarting with Row 1: It's in Norfolk County, so that doesn't match our claim which is about Plymouth County. So I can skip this row.\n\nRow 2 is also in Norfolk County, same as above. No match here either.\n\nMoving on to Row 3: This is in Plymouth County, location Rockland. The roads intersected are Route 123. But the location is Rockland, not Hanover. So while it does intersect Route 123, it's not in Hanover. Not relevant for our claim.\n\nRow 4 is another entry for Plymouth County, Rockland. Again, same as Row 3 but different milepost and notes about eastern terminus. Still, the location is Rockland, so no match for Hanover.\n\nNow, Row 5: This is in Plymouth County, location Hanover. The roads intersected here are Route 53, not Route 123. Additionally, the notes mention it's the northern terminus of a concurrency with Route 53 and another route (probably 139). So this row doesn't show an intersection with Route 123.\n\nWait, let me double-check all rows to make sure I haven't missed any. Rows 3 and 4 are Rockland in Plymouth County intersecting Route 123, but not Hanover. Row 5 is Hanover in Plymouth County but only intersects Route 53. No other rows mention Hanover or Route 123 together.\n\nSo putting it all together: The claim says Hanover (Plymouth) intersects Route 123. From the table, Hanover's intersection is with Route 53, not 123. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Hanover in Plymouth County intersects Route 123. Checking the table:\n\n- The only entries for Plymouth County and Hanover (Row 5) show intersections with Route 53, not Route 123.\n\nThus, the claim is false because there's no evidence of Route 123 intersection at Hanover in Plymouth County.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"county\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"roads intersected\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

To verify this, I should look through each row of the table to see if there are any entries where the location is Weymouth and the milepost is 12.8.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: Location is Stoughton, milepost is 3.0. Not relevant.\n- Row 2: Location is Weymouth, but the milepost is listed as \"(no major junctions)\". So there's no specific milepost number here, which means we can't confirm that 12.8 is in Weymouth from this row.\n- Rows 3,4,5 are all in Plymouth County, so they don't apply to Weymouth.\n\nSince the claim mentions milepost 12.8 at Weymouth, but looking at Row 2 (the only row for Weymouth), there's no milepost number provided\u2014it just says \"(no major junctions)\". Therefore, there's no support in the table that milepost 12.8 is located in Weymouth.\n\nSo, the relevant cell here would be Row 2's \"milepost\" column to check if it contains 12.8, but since it doesn't, the claim isn't supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a specific milepost at a location, but the table does not list that milepost in Weymouth.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"milepost\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
