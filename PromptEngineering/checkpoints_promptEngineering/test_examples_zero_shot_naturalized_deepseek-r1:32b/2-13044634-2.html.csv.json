    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"3 game be play in hammond , in\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully. It seems like there might be a typo or grammatical error because it says \"be play,\" which should probably be \"were played.\" So, I'm assuming the intended meaning is that three games were played in Hammond, Indiana.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row represents a game with details like result, record, opponent, method, round, time, and location. The relevant information here would be the location column for each row because we're checking where the games took place.\n\nLet's go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Location is Hammond, Indiana, United States.\nRow 2: Location is Valparaiso, United States.\nRow 3: Location is Hoffman Estates, Illinois, United States.\nRow 4: Location is Hammond, Indiana, United States.\nRow 5: Location is Hammond, Indiana, United States.\n\nSo, from this, I can see that Rows 1, 4, and 5 have the location as Hammond, Indiana. That makes three games played in Hammond. The other two rows are in different locations, so they don't count towards the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim that three games were played in Hammond is true because there are exactly three entries where the location is Hammond, Indiana.\n\nNow, regarding the JSON output required: I need to list each relevant cell from the table that supports this conclusion. Each row index (starting at 0) and the column name \"location\" will be included for Rows 1, 4, and 5.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the location entries in Rows 0, 3, and 4 of the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that three games were played in Hammond. By examining the 'location' column across all rows, we find that this is accurate as three entries (Rows 1, 4, and 5) specify Hammond, Indiana.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"the game against jonatas novaes be 1 of 2 game decide unanimously.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find any mention of Jonatas Novaes. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Opponent is Cliff Wright.\n- Row 2: Opponent is Lc Davis.\n- Row 3: Opponent is Jonatas Novaes.\n- Rows 4 and 5: Opponents are Mark Sinclair and Kori Trussell, respectively.\n\nSo, the relevant row for Jonatas Novaes is Row 3. Now, I'll check the details in this row to see if the claim holds.\n\nThe claim mentions two things:\n1. The game against Jonatas Novaes was one of two games decided by a unanimous decision.\n2. It's phrased as \"1 of 2 game decide unanimously,\" which suggests that among all games, two were decided by a unanimous vote, and this particular one is one of them.\n\nLooking at Row 3, the method of victory is listed as \"decision (unanimous).\" That means it was indeed a unanimous decision. Now, I need to check if there's another game in the table that also resulted in a unanimous decision.\n\nLet me go through each row again:\n\n- Row 1: Method is \"technical decision (unanimous)\". So that's one.\n- Row 3: As mentioned, it's a \"decision (unanimous)\", so that's two.\n\nRows 2 and others have different methods. Therefore, there are exactly two games decided by a unanimous decision in the table.\n\nSince Jonatas Novaes' game is one of these two, the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the match against Jonatas Novaes was one of two games decided by a unanimous decision. The table shows two such instances: Row 1 and Row 3. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"the game against lc davis be 1 of 2 which last 5 minute\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It seems a bit unclear, but I think it's saying that the game (fight) against LC Davis was one of two that lasted five minutes. So, I need to check if there were exactly two fights in the table that went the full 5 minutes and whether the fight against LC Davis was one of them.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: Opponent is Cliff Wright, time is 2:26.\n- Row 2: Opponent is LC Davis, time is 5:00. This is exactly five minutes.\n- Row 3: Opponent is Jonatas Novaes, time is 5:00. Also exactly five minutes.\n- Row 4: Opponent is Mark Sinclair, time is 1:22.\n- Row 5: Opponent is Kori Trussell, time is 2:20.\n\nSo, the fights that lasted five minutes are Rows 2 and 3. That makes two fights. The fight against LC Davis (Row 2) is indeed one of these two. Therefore, the claim seems to hold true because there were exactly two fights lasting five minutes, and the LC Davis match was one of them.\n\nI need to extract the relevant cells for verification. For LC Davis's row (Row 2), I'll check the opponent and time columns. Similarly, for Jonatas Novaes's fight in Row 3, which also lasted 5:00, but since the claim is about LC Davis being one of two, both these rows are relevant to confirm that exactly two fights lasted five minutes.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 2, \"opponent\" and \"time\"\n- Row 3, \"opponent\" and \"time\"\n\nWait, but does the claim specify exactly two? The wording is a bit unclear. It says \"1 of 2 which last 5 minute.\" So it's about whether LC Davis's fight was one where the time was five minutes, and that there were exactly two such fights.\n\nYes, so Rows 2 and 3 both have time as 5:00. Therefore, there are two fights that lasted five minutes, and LC Davis is one of them. So the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the game against kori trussel be 1 of 2 which end by a rear naked choke submission.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down what this means. It's claiming that in two games, one was against Kori Trussell and both ended with a rear naked choke submission.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 5 is about Kori Trussell. The method used was \"submission (rear naked choke)\". So that's one instance of a rear naked choke submission.\n\nNow I need to check if there's another row where the method was also a rear naked choke. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Method is technical decision (unanimous) \u2013 not a submission.\n- Row 2: Decision split \u2013 not a submission.\n- Row 3: Decision unanimous \u2013 still a decision, not a submission.\n- Row 4: Submission via rear naked choke. This matches the method.\n\nSo there are two rows where the method was rear naked choke submission: Row 4 and Row 5. Both used that method against different opponents (Mark Sinclair in Row 4 and Kori Trussell in Row 5).\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because both of those fights ended with a rear naked choke submission.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there are two games ending with rear naked choke submissions, one being against Kori Trussell. The table shows that both Row 4 (Mark Sinclair) and Row 5 (Kori Trussell) used this method.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break down the claim: \"the game against cliff wright be 1 of 3 that go for 3 round.\" \n\nFirst, I identify which row in the table corresponds to Cliff Wright. Looking at Row 1, the opponent is listed as \"cliff wright,\" so that's the relevant row.\n\nNext, the claim states that this was one of three games that went to three rounds. So I need to check how many fights (rows) have a round number of 3.\n\nLooking through each row:\n- Row 1: Round 3\n- Row 2: Round 3\n- Row 3: Round 3\n- Rows 4 and 5: Both are in Round 1\n\nSo there are three entries with Round 3.

Looking at each row:\n\n- Row 1: Location is Hammond, Indiana.\n- Row 4: Location is Hammond, Indiana.\n- Row 5: Location is Hammond, Indiana.\n\nSo that's three games in total from these rows (Row 1, 4, and 5).\n\nNext, I need to verify if each of these three games had exactly 3 rounds. Checking the 'round' column for each:\n\n- Row 1: Round 3.\n- Row 4: Round 1.\n- Row 5: Round 1.\n\nWait a minute, Rows 4 and 5 both have round 1, not round 3. So only Row 1 has 3 rounds.

Let me break down the claim and check each part against the data.\n\nThe claim is: \"the game against jonatas novaes be 1 of 2 game decide unanimously and the only victory method that occur more than 1 time\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse this into two main parts:\n\n1. The game against Jonatas Novaes was one of two games decided unanimously.\n2. This victory method (unanimous decision) is the only one that occurred more than once.\n\nLet's check each part step by step.\n\n**Part 1: Checking if Jonatas Novaes' game was a unanimous decision and how many such decisions exist.**\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different fight. I'll go through each row to see the method of victory.\n\n- Row 1: Method is \"technical decision (unanimous)\". So that's a unanimous decision.\n- Row 2: Method is \"decision (split)\", which isn't unanimous.\n- Row 3: Method is \"decision (unanimous)\" again. This is another unanimous decision.\n- Rows 4 and 5 have submission methods, so not relevant for this part.\n\nSo, there are two games with a unanimous decision: rows 1 and 3.\n\nThe claim says the game against Novaes (row 3) was one of these two. Yes, that's correct because row 3 is about Jonatas Novaes and it's a unanimous decision. So the first part checks out.\n\n**Part 2: Checking if this victory method (unanimous decision) occurs more than once and whether it's the only method to do so.**\n\nFrom above, we have two instances of unanimous decisions. Let me check other methods:\n\n- Submission (rear naked choke): Occurs in rows 4 and 5. That's two times.\n- Split decision: Only once (row 2).\n\nWait a minute, submission occurs twice as well. So both \"unanimous decision\" and \"submission\" occur more than once.\n\nThe claim states that the only victory method occurring more than once is the unanimous decision. However, this isn't true because submission also occurs twice.\n\nTherefore, the second part of the claim is false because there's another method (submission) that occurred multiple times.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSince the second condition in the claim isn't met, the entire claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the game against lc davis be 1 of 2 which last 5 minute and 1 of 2 that take place in the united state.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. The game against LC Davis was one of two that lasted 5 minutes.\n2. It was also one of two games that took place in the United States.\n\nLet me check each part step by step using the table provided.\n\nLooking at Row 2: This is the game against LC Davis. The time listed here is 5:00, so it did last exactly 5 minutes.\n\nNow, I need to see if there's another game that also lasted 5 minutes. Scanning through all rows:\n\n- Row 1: Time is 2:26\n- Row 3: Time is 5:00\n- Rows 4 and 5: Times are 1:22 and 2:20 respectively.\n\nSo, LC Davis's game (Row 2) is one of two games that lasted 5 minutes. The other is in Row 3 against Jonatas Novaes.\n\nNext, checking the locations:\n\nThe claim says LC Davis's game was one of two that took place in the United States. Let me see where each game was held.\n\n- Row 1: Hammond, Indiana, United States\n- Row 2: Valparaiso, United States\n- Row 3: Hoffman Estates, Illinois, United States\n- Rows 4 and 5: Both are in Hammond, Indiana, United States\n\nWait a minute. All the games listed are in the United States except maybe one? Let me check again:\n\nRow 1: Yes, US.\nRow 2: Valparaiso is in the US.\nRow 3: Hoffman Estates, Illinois \u2013 US.\nRows 4 and 5: Hammond, Indiana \u2013 US.\n\nSo all five games took place in the US. The claim says LC Davis's game was one of two that were in the US. But since all are in the US, this part isn't correct. The claim is implying only two were in the US, but actually, all five were.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe it means that LC Davis's game and another took place in the US, which would be true because there are multiple games in the US. But since all are in the US, saying one of two isn't accurate. Alternatively, maybe the claim is saying among all his games, only two were in the US, but according to the table, all are in the US.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's re-examine:\n\nThe claim says LC Davis's game was one of two that lasted 5 minutes and also one of two that took place in the US.\n\nFrom the table, there are indeed two games that lasted 5 minutes: Row 2 (LC Davis) and Row 3 (Jonatas Novaes). So part one is correct.\n\nFor the location part, all five games are in the US. Therefore, saying it's one of two that took place in the US isn't accurate because there are more than two. The claim implies only two were in the US, but actually, all five were. So this part is false.\n\nSince both conditions need to be true for the entire claim to hold, and the location condition fails, the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that LC Davis's game was one of two lasting 5 minutes (which is correct) and one of two in the US (incorrect as all games are in the US).

I'll go through each row to find matches where the round was 3.\n\nRow 1: Opponent is Cliff Wright. Round is 3, location is Hammond, IN.\nRow 2: Opponent LC Davis, round 3, location Valparaiso, US. Not Hammond.\nRow 3: Opponent Jonatas Novaes, round 3, location Hoffman Estates, IL. Not Hammond.\nRow 4: Opponent Mark Sinclair, round 1. Doesn't fit.\nRow 5: Opponent Kori Trussell, round 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo, the only matches that went to 3 rounds are Row 1 and Row 2 and Row 3. But checking their locations:\n\n- Row 1: Hammond\n- Row 2: Valparaiso\n- Row 3: Hoffman Estates\n\nOnly Row 1 is in Hammond. So, the claim says all three games (including Cliff Wright's) were in Hammond, but that's not true because the other two 3-round matches were elsewhere.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
