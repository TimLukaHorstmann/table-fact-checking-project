    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be currently 12 t - 260 eu aircraft in service\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully. The claim mentions the specific aircraft version \"t-260 eu\" and states that there are currently 12 of them in service. My task is to check if this information matches what's provided in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different aircraft with details like name, origin, type, versions, and number in service. I'll go through each row one by one to find any mention of \"t-260 eu\".\n\nStarting from Row 1 up, Row 1 is about the Cessna A-37 Dragonfly. Not relevant. Rows 2 to 5 also don't mention anything related to t-260 eu. \n\nThen I get to Row 11: \"aermacchi sf260\". The version listed here is \"t - 260 eu\", which matches the claim exactly. So, this row seems relevant.\n\nNow, looking at the \"in service\" column for Row 11, it says there are 12 aircraft in service (with a note of 12 delivered). That's exactly what the claim states\u201412 t-260 eu aircraft in service.\n\nTo make sure I didn't miss anything else, I'll quickly check the remaining rows. Rows 12 to 16 don't mention \"t-260 eu\" either, so Row 11 is the only relevant one here.\n\nSo, putting it together: The claim specifies the version t-260 eu and a count of 12 in service. The table confirms both details in Row 11. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"aircraft\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"versions\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"in service\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Looking at the table, I should search for an aircraft with this version number. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Cessna A-37 Dragonfly, version A-37B\n- Row 2: FMA IA 58 Pucar\u00e3\u00a1, version A-58\n- Row 3: Lockheed C-130 Hercules, version C-130B\n- Row 4: Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante, version C-95\n- Row 5: Beechcraft Twin Bonanza, version D50\n- Row 6: CASA C-212 Aviocar, version C-212-200\n- Row 7: Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia, version EMB 120\n- Row 8: Cessna 206 Stationair, version U206H\n- Row 9: Beechcraft B58 Baron, version B-58\n- Row 10: British Aerospace 125, versions 700A 600A\n- Row 11: Aermacchi SF260, version T-260 EU\n- Row 12: Pilatus PC-7 Turbo Trainer, version -92\n- Row 13: Cessna T-41 Mescalero, version T-41D\n- Row 14: Aerospatiale AS 365 Dauphin, version AS 365\n- Row 15: Bell 212 Twin Huey, version Bell 212\n- Row 16: Bell UH-1 Iroquois, version UH-1H\n\nOkay, so in row 11, the aircraft is Aermacchi SF260 with version T-260 EU. The claim says \"t - 260 eu\", which matches exactly.\n\nNext, the claim states there are 12 of these aircraft in service. Looking at row 11 again, under 'in service' it's listed as 12 (13 delivered).

The claim says: \"bell uh-1 iroquois be the version of b-58 aircraft model originate in the united state which have 2 in service.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim:\n\n1. **Aircraft Model**: The claim mentions \"b-58\" as the model.\n2. **Version**: It refers to \"bell uh-1 iroquois\" as a version of this model.\n3. **Origin**: The origin should be the United States.\n4. **In Service Count**: There are 2 aircraft in service.\n\nNow, let's check each part against the table.\n\nLooking at Row 9: It mentions \"beechcraft b58 baron,\" which has versions \"b-58\" and is from the United States with 2 in service.
