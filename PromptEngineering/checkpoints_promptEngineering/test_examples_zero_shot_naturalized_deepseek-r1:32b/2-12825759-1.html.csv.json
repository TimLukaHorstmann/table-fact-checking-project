Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"twickenham stoop be the venue on 6 april 2007, where the score be 22 - 12.\"\n\nFirst, I'll check each part of this statement against the data in the table.\n\n1. **Venue on 6 April 2007**: The claim mentions \"twickenham stoop\" as the venue for that date. Looking at Row 1 of the table, the date is indeed 6 April 2007, and the venue listed is \"twickenham stoop.\" So this part matches.\n\n2. **Score on that date**: The claim says the score was 22-12. However, in Row 1, the score is listed as \"26 - 6\" (assuming it's Home - Away). This doesn't match the claimed score of 22-12.\n\nSo, while the venue part is correct, the score does not match what's stated in the claim. Therefore, the entire claim isn't fully supported by the data provided in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"when twickenham stoop be the venue on 28 march 2009 , the score be 22 - 12\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components. The key pieces of information are:\n\n- Venue: Twickenham Stoop\n- Date: 28 March 2009\n- Score: 22-12\n\nI need to check each of these against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find where the venue is Twickenham Stoop and the date is 28 March 2009. \n\nRow by row:\n\n1. Row 0: Venue is jjb stadium on 6 april 2009.\n2. ...\n3. Scanning through, I reach Row 14 (index starting at 0). Wait, let me count correctly.\n\nWait, actually, each row in the table is provided with a specific date and venue. Let me go step by step:\n\n- Rows 0 to 3: Various venues, not Twickenham.\n- Looking through all rows until I find the one that matches both Venue=Twickenham Stoop and Date=28 March 2009.\n\nWait, when I check each row's 'date' column:\n\nRow 14 (index 14): Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me count properly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to scan all rows for the date \"28 march 2009\".\n\nLooking through the dates:\n\n- Row 0: April 6, 2009\n- Row 1: March 5, 2009 (venue jjb)\n- Row 2: March 14, 2009 (jjb stadium)\n- ...\nWait, perhaps I need to look for March 28 specifically.\n\nWait, let me list the dates:\n\nLooking at all rows' 'date' column. Let's go through each row:\n\nRow 0: date is April 6, 2009\nRow 1: March 5, 2009\nRow 2: March 14, 2009\nRow 3: March 27, 2009\nRow 4: April 18, 2009 (venue jjb)\nWait no, looking at the data provided, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the initial table provided, each row's date is as follows:\n\nLooking back at the user's table, each row has a 'date' field. Let me list them:\n\nRow 0: April 6, 2009\nRow 1: March 5, 2009 (venue jjb stadium)\nRow 2: March 14, 2009 (jjb)\nRow 3: March 27, 2009 (jjb)\nWait no, perhaps I'm not reading correctly. Let me look at each row's details.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 0: date is April 6, 2009\nvenue jjb stadium\nscore 14-8\n\nRow 1: March 5, 2009\njjb\n14-8\n\nWait no, the initial data has rows from index 0 to 31. Let me look for the date \"28 march 2009\".\n\nLooking through each row's 'date' column:\n\nRow 0: April 6, 2009 (index 0)\nRow 1: March 5, 2009 (index 1)\nRow 2: March 14, 2009 (index 2)\nRow 3: March 27, 2009 (index 3)\n...\nWait, perhaps I'm not finding it because maybe the date is on a different row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the row with date \"28 march 2009\" doesn't exist. Let me go through all rows:\n\nLooking at each row in the table provided by the user, their dates include April 6, March 5, March 14, March 27, etc., but I don't see a row with date \"28 march 2009\".\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing it. Let me check all rows again.\n\nAfter reviewing each row, I realize that none of the rows have the exact date of \"28 March 2009\". The closest dates are:\n\n- March 5, 14, 27, etc., but no 28th.\n\nTherefore, there is no row where the date is 28 March 2009 at Twickenham Stoop. Hence, the claim cannot be supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a game at Twickenham Stoop on 28 March 2009 with a score of 22-12. Checking the table, there is no entry for this date and venue.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
