    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"Manchester United and Burnley both beat their competition without the competition scoring any points.\" So, I have to check two teams: Manchester United and Burnley.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, each row represents a different season and FA Cup final result. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1 is about the 1969-70 FA Cup. The winner is Manchester United, and they beat Watford with a score of 2-0. So here, the competition (Watford) scored 0 points. That fits the claim for Manchester United.\n\nNext, I need to check Burnley. Looking through the rows, Row 5 mentions Burnley as the winner in the 1973-74 season. They played against Leicester City and won with a score of 1-0. So Leicester scored 0 points there too. That means both Manchester United and Burnley won their matches without the opposing teams scoring any goals.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there are no other instances where either team didn't meet this condition. For example, did Manchester United ever lose or have a tie? From the table provided, Row 1 is the only entry for Manchester United as the winner with a clean sheet. Similarly, Burnley appears once in Row 5 with a win and the opponent scoring nothing.\n\nSo both conditions are satisfied: each team won their respective matches without letting the competition score any points. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Manchester United and Burnley both defeated their opponents without allowing them to score any goals.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the most highly attended game be on august 5 1972 , at st andrew 's\".\n\nFirst, I'll look for the date mentioned in the claim, which is August 5, 1972. Checking each row:\n\n- Row 1: Date is April 10, 1970.\n- Row 2: May 7, 1971.\n- Row 3: August 5, 1972. This matches the date in the claim.\n- Row 4: August 18, 1973.\n- Row 5: May 9, 1974.\n\nSo, the relevant row is Row 3. The venue for this game was \"st andrew 's\", which also matches the claim's location.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"stoke city and wolverhampton wanderer both beat their competition by score 3 points\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The key elements here are:\n\n1. **Teams Involved**: Stoke City and Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n2. **Action**: Both teams \"beat their competition.\"\n3. **Score**: They did so by a score of 3 points.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table, I see that the scores are given in goals, not points. So perhaps the claim means they won with a goal difference or exact score of 3-0? Or maybe it's a translation issue where \"points\" refer to goals. I need to clarify this.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an FA Cup final result. The columns include season, date, winner, loser, score, venue, and attendance.\n\nThe claim states that both Stoke City and Wolverhampton Wanderers beat their competition by a score of 3 points. Since in football (soccer), \"points\" usually refer to league standings, but here it's the FA Cup, so I think they mean goals. So I'll interpret this as winning with a goal difference or an exact score where they scored three goals.\n\nNow, let's check each team:\n\n**Stoke City**:\n- Looking through the rows, Stoke City appears in Row 2 and Row 3.\n  - **Row 2**: Season 1970-71. Winner: Stoke City, Loser: Everton, Score: 3-2. So they won with a score of 3 goals to 2.\n  - **Row 3**: Season 1971-72. Winner: Birmingham City, Loser: Stoke City, Score: 0-0 (4-3 pens). Here, Stoke lost in the final.\n\nSo Stoke City won once by scoring 3 goals against Everton.\n\n**Wolverhampton Wanderers (Wolves)**:\n- Looking through the rows, Wolves are mentioned in Row 4.\n  - **Row 4**: Season 1972-73. Winner: Wolverhampton Wanderers, Loser: Arsenal, Score: 3-1.\n\nSo they won by scoring 3 goals against Arsenal.\n\nNow, evaluating the claim:\n- Both Stoke City and Wolves did win matches where they scored exactly 3 goals each (Stoke in Row 2 with a score of 3-2 and Wolves in Row 4 with a score of 3-1). So both teams beat their competition by scoring three goals. \n\nWait, but the claim says \"by score 3 points.\" Since I'm interpreting this as 3 goals, then yes, both achieved that.\n\nHowever, let me double-check if there's any ambiguity:\n\n- The term \"score\" in football refers to the goal count. So \"score of 3 points\" is a bit confusing because in football, points are awarded based on wins (3), draws (1), etc., but here it's about goals.\n  \nBut given that the claim mentions both teams beating their competition by 3 points, and considering the context, I think it refers to scoring three goals. Therefore, the relevant rows are Row 2 for Stoke City and Row 4 for Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE because both teams won with scores of 3-2 and 3-1 respectively.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both Stoke City and Wolverhampton Wanderers beat their competition by a score of 3 points. Interpreting this as winning with three goals each, we find:\n\n- **Stoke City** won in Row 2 with a score of 3-2.\n- **Wolverhampton Wanderers** won in Row 4 with a score of 3-1.\n\nThus, both teams achieved the required score. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So, I need to determine whether the claim \"highbury be the venue for 2 game , in 1970 and 1973\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is saying. It mentions that Highbury was the venue for two games: one in 1970 and another in 1973. So, my goal is to check if there are exactly two games at Highbury in those specific years according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different season of the FA Cup, with details like the date, winner, loser, score, venue, and attendance. The seasons span from 1969-70 up to 1973-74. I need to check each row for the venue being Highbury and see if they occurred in 1970 and 1973.\n\nStarting with Row 1: Season 1969-70, date is April 10, 1970. The venue here is Highbury. So that's one game in 1970.\n\nMoving to Row 4: Season 1972-73, date is August 18, 1973. Venue is also Highbury. That's another game, this time in 1973.\n\nNow, I should check the other rows to ensure there are no more games at Highbury that fall into these years or any others that might affect the claim. \n\nRow 2: Season 1970-71, date is May 7, 1971. Venue is Selhurst Park, so not relevant.\n\nRow 3: Season 1971-72, date August 5, 1972. Venue is St Andrew's, so again, not Highbury.\n\nRow 5: Season 1973-74, date May 9, 1974. Venue is Filbert Street. Not Highbury either.\n\nSo from this, I can see that there are two games at Highbury: one in 1970 and another in 1973. That matches the claim exactly. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells for these checks would be:\n\n- For Row 1: the 'venue' column shows Highbury.\n- For Row 4: again, the 'venue' column shows Highbury.\n\nBoth of these are in the specified years, so they support the claim. \n\nI don't think there's any need to look further because we've found exactly two games at Highbury in the correct years and no others that would contradict or add more than what's claimed.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"stoke city lose 1 time and win over a year later\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find mentions of Stoke City as either winners or losers.\n\nStarting with Row 1: Winner is Manchester United, loser is Watford. No mention of Stoke here.\n\nRow 2: The season is 1970-71 FA Cup. Winner is Stoke City and they lost to Everton? Wait no, the winner is Stoke City, so they won against Everton on May 7, 1971.\n\nRow 3: Season 1971-72. Winner is Birmingham City, loser is Stoke City. So here, Stoke lost on August 5, 1972. That's one loss for Stoke.\n\nSo far, I've found that Stoke won once (Row 2) and lost once (Row 3). Now the claim says they lose once and win over a year later. Wait, but in Row 2, Stoke won on May 7, 1971. Then in Row 3, they lost on August 5, 1972. The time between their win and loss is about a little over a year, from May 1971 to August 1972.\n\nWait, but the claim says they lose once and then win over a year later. But in Row 2, Stoke won first on May 1971, then lost on August 1972. So that's losing after winning, not winning after losing. The wording is \"lose 1 time and win over a year later.\" So according to the claim, they should lose once and then have a subsequent win more than a year after the loss.\n\nBut looking at the data, Stoke won in 1970-71 (Row 2), then lost in 1971-72 (Row 3). There's no subsequent row where Stoke wins again. The next relevant mention is in Row 4: Wolverhampton Wanderers win against Arsenal on August 18, 1973. No mention of Stoke there.\n\nSo according to the table, Stoke lost once and didn't win after that within the provided data. Therefore, the claim that they lose once and then win over a year later isn't supported because while they did lose once (Row 3), they don't have a subsequent win in the table.\n\nWait, but perhaps I misread the seasons. Let me check the seasons again:\n\n- Row 2: Season 1970-71, Stoke wins on May 7, 1971.\n- Row 3: Season 1971-72, Stoke loses on August 5, 1972.\n\nSo between their win and loss, it's about a year later. But the claim says they lose once and then win over a year later. That would require that after losing, they have a win more than a year after that loss. However, in the table, after their loss in 1972 (Row 3), there's no further mention of Stoke winning again. So the claim isn't fully supported because while they did lose once (Row 3), they don't have another win recorded here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider if \"over a year later\" refers to the time between their loss and their next event. But in this case, there is no next event for Stoke beyond Row 3. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported as per the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Stoke City loses once and wins over a year later. From the table:\n\n- Stoke lost in the 1971-72 season on August 5, 1972 (Row 3).\n- They previously won in the 1970-71 season on May 7, 1971 (Row 2), which is over a year earlier. However, after their loss, there's no subsequent win for Stoke City in the table.\n\nSince Stoke doesn't have a win after their loss as per the given data, the claim isn't fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"loser\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine whether the claim \"manchester united and burnley both lose to their competition\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts: Manchester United losing a match and Burnley also losing a match. I need to check each part separately using the information from the table.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five rows, each representing different FA Cup seasons and their respective final details.\n\nStarting with Manchester United:\n- I scan through each row to find any mention of Manchester United.\n- Row 1 mentions Manchester United as the winner against Watford on April 10, 1970.

Again, Burnley won that match; they didn't lose.\n\nSince both Manchester United and Burnley are listed as winners in their respective matches, there's no instance where either lost to their competition based on the provided data.

The score was 3-2 against Everton. So, the difference here is 1 goal, not points. But wait, in football, sometimes \"points\" can be confused with goals. However, in sports like football, a win typically gives 3 points, so maybe the claim refers to points instead of goals.\n\nWait, but let's clarify: The term \"beat by only 1 point\" is unclear because in FA Cup matches, the result isn't usually measured in points but in goals. But perhaps the claim is using \"points\" interchangeably with goals. Alternatively, it might refer to league points if considering their overall standings, but the table only shows cup results.\n\nWait, no\u2014each row is about an FA Cup final, so each winner gets the FA Cup, not necessarily league points. So in the context of this table, perhaps \"points\" are meant as goals. But let's check both possibilities.\n\nStoke City won 3-2 against Everton (Row 2). That's a 1-goal difference. Wolverhampton Wanderers won in Row 4 with a score of 3-1 against Arsenal. That's a 2-goal difference.\n\nAlternatively, if \"points\" refers to league points, but the table doesn't provide that information. So perhaps the claim is about goals. \n\nWait, the claim says both teams beat their competition by only 1 point. If it's about goals, then Stoke City did (3-2), but Wolverhampton Wanderers won 3-1, which is a 2-goal difference. So one team had a 1-goal margin and the other a 2-goal margin. Therefore, not both by only 1 point.\n\nAlternatively, if it's about league points, maybe in that season, each win gives 3 points, but the table doesn't show their league positions or points. So I think the claim is referring to goals because that's what the table provides.\n\nTherefore, Stoke City won by 1 goal (3-2) and Wolverhampton Wanderers won by 2 goals (3-1).

So it's actually the most attended game in this table.\n\nBut the claim says it's the second most highly attended. Since there are only five rows, the highest is Row3 at 25841, then next would be Row1 with 15105 or maybe Row4? Wait no: Row4 has 21038 which is higher than Row1's 15105. So attendance order from highest to lowest:\nRow3 (25841), Row4 (21038), Row1 (15105), then Row2 (5031) and Row5 (6458). Wait no, because 6458 is higher than 5031.\n\nWait let me list all attendances clearly:\n- Row1: 15,105\n- Row2: 5,031\n- Row3: 25,841 (highest)\n- Row4: 21,038\n- Row5: 6,458\n\nSo the order is:\n1. Row3 - 25,841\n2. Row4 - 21,038\n3. Row1 - 15,105\n4. Row5 - 6,458\n5. Row2 - 5,031\n\nSo the second most attended game is Row4 with 21,038 on August 18, 1973 at Highbury.\n\nBut the claim says that the game on Aug 5, 1972 (Row3) is the second most. But according to this, it's actually the highest attended.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Row3 has the highest attendance, not the second highest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at the task here. The user wants me to determine if the claim \"selhurst park be the venue for 2 game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. \"Selhurst Park\" is a specific venue, and the claim states that this venue hosted two games. So my job is to check if Selhurst Park appears exactly twice in the 'venue' column across all rows.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five rows total. I'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Venue is Highbury.\n2. **Row 2**: Venue is Selhurst Park.\n3. **Row 3**: Venue is St Andrew's.\n4. **Row 4**: Venue is Highbury again.\n5. **Row 5**: Venue is Filbert Street.\n\nFrom this, I can see that Selhurst Park only appears once in the entire table, specifically in Row 2. Since the claim states it was used for two games, but there's only one instance, the claim must be FALSE.\n\nTo make sure I didn't miss anything, I'll double-check each row again. Rows 1 and 4 have Highbury as the venue, so they don't count towards Selhurst Park. Row 3 is St Andrew's and Row 5 is Filbert Street. Only Row 2 has Selhurst Park. Therefore, there's only one game at that venue.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other nuances, like possible misspellings or alternative names for the venues, but in this case, everything seems correctly spelled as per the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"selhurst park be the venue for 2 game.\" Upon reviewing the table, Selhurst Park is listed only once as a venue. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
