    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"In the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup Final, Tisha Venturini played 4 matches at Gavle.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what the claim is asserting. It says that during the 1995 Sweden FIFA Women's World Cup Final, there was a player named Tisha Venturini who participated in four matches all held in Gavle.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists various matches under different competitions. The first row mentions \"Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup final,\" but the details for that row seem to be placeholders with repeated phrases like \"match: sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final\" etc., which likely means this row isn't providing actual data.\n\nNext, I'll examine the subsequent rows labeled as match numbers 1 through 6. These all pertain to the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup. Each has details like date, location, lineup, result, and competition type (e.g., group match, quarter-final). \n\nFocusing on the locations: matches 1,2,3 are in Gavle or Helsingborg; specifically, matches 1,2,4 are in Gavle. The semifinal is in Vasteras, and the third-place match is back in Gavle.\n\nLooking at the lineup details for each match, row 5 (match 4) mentions a substitution at 80' with \"cromwell,\" but no mention of Tisha Venturini. Similarly, other matches have lineups labeled as \"start\" without any player names listed. So, there's no explicit information about which players were in each match.\n\nAdditionally, the claim refers to four matches played at Gavle. However, from the table data, during the Sweden 1995 World Cup, there are only three matches at Gavle (matches 1,2,4, and 6 as third-place). But more importantly, each of these matches doesn't list Tisha Venturini in their lineups.\n\nMoreover, when I look through all the rows, there's no mention of Tisha Venturini anywhere. The closest is in match 13 (row 15), which is part of the 1999 World Cup in Los Angeles, where a player named Milbrett is mentioned with an 115' substitution, but again, not Tisha.\n\nTherefore, since there's no data about Tisha Venturini participating in any matches during the Sweden 1995 World Cup Final and only three matches at Gavle (with no indication of four), the claim isn't supported by the table. Hence, it should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"match\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The result is 3-3, which is a draw. So that's one match.\n\nNext, Row 9: Date is 1996-07-25. Result is 0-0, another draw. That's the second.\n\nThen, checking for 1999-07-10. Looking at Row 13: Date is 1999-07-10. The result is listed as 0-0 (pso 5-4).

It's saying that in the highest-scoring game, 5 goals were scored, and this happened on June 10, 1995.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a match with details like date, location, result, etc. The result column shows the score of the match.\n\nI should go through each row to find the highest-scoring game. Let's check each relevant cell:\n\n- Row 2: Result is 3-3 \u2192 Total goals = 6\n- Row 3: Result is 2-0 \u2192 Total goals = 2\n- Row 4: Result is 4-1 \u2192 Total goals = 5\n- Row 5: Result is 4-0 \u2192 Total goals = 4\n- Row 6: Result is 0-1 \u2192 Total goals = 1\n- Row 7: Result is 2-0 \u2192 Total goals = 2\n\nWait, I notice that Row 2 has a total of 6 goals, which is higher than the claim's 5. So the highest-scoring game in this data isn't on June 10 but earlier.\n\nRow 4, date 1995-06-10, result is 4-1, so total goals are 5. But Row 2 has a higher total with 6 goals. Therefore, the claim that the highest-scoring game (with 5 goals) was on June 10 is incorrect because there's another game with more goals.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\nRow 2: date 1995-06-06 and result 3-3\nRow 4: date 1995-06-10 and result 4-1\n\nThe claim mentions June 10, but the highest score is actually on June 6.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"tisha venturini played a total of 13 matches in 3 different tournaments\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim entails:\n\n1. **Number of Matches**: The claim states that Tisha Venturini played in 13 matches.\n2. **Number of Tournaments**: She participated in 3 different tournaments.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it seems to list various matches with details like date, location, lineup, result, and competition. Each row represents a match or an overview of a tournament.\n\nI'll start by identifying which rows mention Tisha Venturini. From the table:\n\n- **Row 4**: Lineup includes \"80' (cromwell)\" but no mention of Venturini.\n- **Row 16**: Lineup mentions \"115' (milbrett)\", notVenturini.\n  \nWait, actually, I might have missed something. Let me go through each row carefully:\n\n- Rows 2 to 8: These are matches in the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup. I don't see Venturini mentioned in any of these lineups.\n  \n- Rows 9 to 13: These are matches from the Atlanta 1996 Olympic women's football tournament. Checking each lineup:\n  - Row 9: lineup is \"start\" \u2013 no mention.\n  - Row 10: same as above.\n  - Row 11: same.\n  - Row 12: lineup is \"start\".\n  - Row 13: lineup is \"start\". No Venturini mentioned here either.\n\n- Rows 14 to 16: These are matches from the USA 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup. Checking each:\n  - Row 15: lineup is \"start\" \u2013 no mention.\n  - Row 16: mentions \"milbrett\", but not Venturini.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I overlooked something. Let me check again:\n\nIn the table, under the 'lineup' column for specific matches, it's either \"start\" or has names like \"cromwell\" or \"milbrett\". There is no mention of Tisha Venturini in any of these lineups across all rows.\n\nTherefore, according to this table, Tisha Venturini did not play in any of the listed matches. If she didn't participate in any matches, her total number of matches would be zero, which contradicts the claim of 13 matches.\n\nAdditionally, since there's no mention of her participation, it implies she was part of none of the three tournaments (Sweden '95, Atlanta '96, USA '99) as per this data.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are false: she didn't play 13 matches and wasn't in 3 different tournaments.\n</think>\n\nThe table doesn't mention Tisha Venturini in any match lineups across the three tournaments. Therefore, her participation count is zero for both matches and tournaments.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"1 out of the 13 match be a gold medal match\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the table. It seems like each row represents a different match or event related to women's football tournaments. The rows are labeled from 1 to 16, but I notice that some rows (like Row 1, 8, and 14) seem to be headers for different tournaments rather than individual matches.\n\nThe claim mentions \"13 match,\" which makes me think it's referring to a specific number of matches in the context. However, looking at the table, there are more than 13 entries because Row 1, 8, and 14 are likely headers, so I need to be careful not to count those as actual matches.\n\nLet's list out all the rows that represent actual matches:\n\n- Rows 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7: These correspond to the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup.\n- Rows 9, 10, 11, 12, 13: These are part of the Atlanta 1996 Olympic Women's Football Tournament.\n- Rows 15 and 16: These belong to the USA 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup.\n\nSo that's a total of 11 matches. But maybe I'm missing something. Let me recount:\n\n- Sweden 1995: Matches 1-6 (Rows 2-7)\n- Atlanta 1996: Matches 7-11 (Rows 9-13)\n- USA 1999: Matches 12-13 (Rows 15-16)\n\nWait, that's 6 + 5 + 2 = 13 matches in total. So the claim is about 1 out of these 13 matches being a gold medal match.\n\nNow, I need to check if any of these 13 matches are labeled as \"gold medal match.\" Looking through each row:\n\n- Row 7: Third place match.\n- Rows 12 and 16: Semifinal and final respectively for the Atlanta and USA tournaments.\n\nWait, in Row 13, it says \"competition: gold medal match.\" So that's one row where the competition is specifically a gold medal match. Let me confirm:\n\nRow 13 details:\n- Match: 11\n- Date: 1996-08-01\n- Location: Athens, GA\n- Lineup: start\n- Result: 2 - 1\n- Competition: gold medal match\n\nYes, this is a gold medal match.

Let me carefully go through each part of the claim and check it against the relevant cells in the table.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure of the claim: It mentions a date (1995-06-06), location (gavle), lineup (start), result (3-3), and competition type (group match). So I need to find if there's a row in the table that matches all these details.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row in the table:\n\nRow 1: This seems like a header or title for the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup Final. It doesn't contain specific match details, so probably not relevant here.\n\nRow 2: Let me look at this row. The 'match' is numbered as 1. The date is 1995-06-06, which matches the claim. The location is Gavle, same as in the claim. The lineup is listed as \"start\", which I think refers to starting lineups or perhaps that they started the game. The result is 3-3, which also matches the claim's score. Lastly, the competition type is a group match, exactly what the claim states.\n\nWait, so all parts of the claim are present in Row 2: correct date, location, lineup, result, and competition type. That seems to directly support the claim.\n\nLet me just check if there are any other rows with similar information that might contradict this. Looking through the rest:\n\nRow 3 has a different date (1995-06-08), so not relevant. Row 4 is on 1995-06-10, another match. Then Rows 5 onwards are later matches in the competition but don't have the same date or result as the claim.\n\nSo, only Row 2 contains all the necessary details that align with the claim.

The other entries (Rows 2-7) are related to matches in Sweden during 1995, so I can skip those since the claim is about 1996.\n\nMoving on to Row 8, it's another header for the Atlanta 1996 Olympic Women's Football Tournament.

Now, checking the other details: lineup is \"start,\" result is 2-1, competition is \"gold medal match.\" This seems to fit perfectly with the claim.\n\nLet me confirm each part:\n\n- **Date**: August 1, 1996 \u2013 matches Row 13.\n- **Location**: Athens, GA \u2013 yes, per Row 13.\n- **Lineup**: The lineup is listed as \"start,\" which aligns with the claim.\n- **Result**: 2-1 \u2013 correct as per the table.\n- **Competition Type**: Gold medal match \u2013 that's exactly what Row 13 states.\n\nSo all parts of the claim are accurately represented in Row 13. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI need to ensure I'm only including the relevant cells from Row 13 that directly support each part of the claim. The columns involved would be date, location, lineup, result, and competition.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"lineup\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
