    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the player on rank 11 have less than 1.237 goal per match\". \n\nFirst, I'll look through the table rows to find the one with rank 11. Scanning each row:\n\n- Row 1: Rank 1\n- Row 2: Rank 2\n- Row 3: Rank 2\n- Row 4: Rank 4\n- Row 5: Rank 5\n- Row 6: Rank 5\n- Row 7: Rank 7\n- Row 8: Rank 7\n- Row 9: Rank 7\n- Row 10: Rank 10\n- Row 11: Rank 11\n\nSo, the relevant row is row 11. Now, I'll check the details of this player.\n\nLooking at row 11:\n- Name: Alfredo di St\u00e9fano\n- Season: 1956/57\n- Club: Real Madrid\n- Goals: 43\n- Apps: 43\n- Goals per match: 1.0\n\nThe claim is about the goals per match being less than 1.237. The player on rank 11 has a goals per match of exactly 1.0, which is indeed less than 1.237. \n\nSo, the relevant cell here is the \"goals per match\" column in row 11.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Alfredo di St\u00e9fano's goals per match (1.0) is less than 1.237.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"goals per match\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"11.0 be the rank that have goal per match more than 1.237\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It seems a bit unclear, but I think it's saying that there is at least one player ranked 11 who has a goals per match (GPM) rate higher than 1.237. Alternatively, maybe it's stating that rank 11 corresponds to a GPM of more than 1.237. Either way, I need to check the table for any row with rank 11 and see if their GPM is above 1.237.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nRow 1: Rank 1, GPM 1.217\nRow 2: Rank 2, GPM 1.224\nRow 3: Rank 2, GPM 1.091\nRow 4: Rank 4, GPM 1.0\nRow 5: Rank 5, GPM 0.981\nRow 6: Rank 5, GPM 0.964\nRow 7: Rank 7, GPM 1.237\nRow 8: Rank 7, GPM 0.964\nRow 9: Rank 7, GPM 0.887\nRow 10: Rank 10, GPM 1.278\nRow 11: Rank 11, GPM 1.0\nRow 12: Rank 12, GPM varies but none above in this row.\n\nSo, looking at rank 11 (Row 11), the GPM is exactly 1.0, which is less than 1.237. There's no other rank 11 entries beyond Row 11. The closest higher GPMs are in ranks below 11 like row 10 with 1.278 and row 7 with 1.237.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"more than 1.237\". So even if there was a rank 11 with exactly 1.237, it wouldn't satisfy the condition because it's not more than that. Since Row 10 is rank 10 and has GPM 1.278 which is above 1.237, but rank 11 doesn't have any entry above 1.237.\n\nTherefore, there are no players ranked 11 with a GPM over 1.237. So the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is checked by examining all rows with rank 11 to see if any have goals per match exceeding 1.237. Only row 11 has this rank, and its goals per match is 1.0, which does not meet the condition.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"goals per match\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim about Lionel Messi is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"lionel messi rank 2 and score 73 goal during the 2011 / 12 season.\" So there are two main points here\u2014rank being 2 and scoring 73 goals in the specified season.\n\nNext, I need to examine the table for any entries related to Lionel Messi from the 2011/12 season. Looking at the rows provided:\n\n- Row 1: lionel messi, 2011/12 season, rank 1, 73 goals.\n- Row 2: lionel messi, 2012/13 season, rank 2, 60 goals.\n- Row 6: lionel messi, 2010/11 season, rank 5, 53 goals.\n\nFrom this, I can see that in the 2011/12 season (Row 1), Messi is ranked 1, not 2. The claim says he was rank 2 during that season, which doesn't align with what's in the table. Additionally, while it does mention him scoring 73 goals in the 2011/12 season, his rank was actually 1, not 2.\n\nTherefore, since the rank mentioned in the claim (rank 2) is incorrect for that specific season, even though he did score 73 goals, the overall claim isn't fully supported by the table. So, it should be marked as FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Lionel Messi had a rank of 2 and scored 73 goals during the 2011/12 season. Checking the table:\n\n- Row 1: Messi in 2011/12 has rank 1, 73 goals.\n\nWhile he did score 73 goals, his rank was 1, not 2 as claimed. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
