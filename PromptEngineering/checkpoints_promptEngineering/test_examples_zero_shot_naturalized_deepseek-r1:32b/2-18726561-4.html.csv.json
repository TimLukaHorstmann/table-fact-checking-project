It mentions that there were three matches that required a replay in January 1976. So, my task is to check how many matches had replays during that month.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a tie with details like home team, away team, score, and date. Some rows have \"tie no: replay\" which indicates a replay match. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- Row 1 to Row 3: These are regular matches without replays.\n- Row 4: Date is February, so not relevant.\n- Rows 5 to 7: Row 6 has a score of 0-0 on 24 January. Then, Row 7 is a replay between the same teams (Wolverhampton Wanderers and Ipswich Town) on 27 January. So that's one replay.\n- Row 8: Regular match on 24 January.\n- Rows 9: This is another replay, as it's marked \"tie no: replay\" with Newcastle United vs Coventry City on 28 January. That's the second replay.\n- Rows 10 to 15: No replays here; all are regular matches.\n- Row 16: Another replay between Portsmouth and Charlton Athletic on 27 January. That makes three replays.\n- Rows 17 to 19: The rest don't have replays.\n\nSo, I've identified three replays in January 1976:\n1. Row 7 (tie no: replay)\n2. Row 9 (tie no: replay)\n3. Row 16 (tie no: replay)\n\nEach of these is a replay match occurring in January 1976. Therefore, the claim that there were three replays is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows three matches that required replays in January 1976.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim \"newcastle united score 2 more goals in their replayed match than manchester unite do in their match\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts: Newcastle United's replayed match and Manchester United's regular match. I need to find the goal scores for both teams from their respective matches.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by locating Newcastle United's replayed match. Scanning through the rows, I see that in Row 9, there's a tie no: replay where Newcastle United is the home team. The score here is 5-0 against Coventry City on January 28, 1976. So Newcastle scored 5 goals in their replay.\n\nNext, I'll look for Manchester United's match. From the table, Row 8 mentions Manchester United with a tie no: 8. Their score was 3-1 against Peterborough United on January 24, 1976. That means Manchester United scored 3 goals in their game.\n\nNow, to evaluate the claim: Newcastle scored 5 goals, and Manchester United scored 3. The difference is 2 goals (5 - 3 = 2). Therefore, Newcastle indeed scored 2 more goals than Manchester United in their respective matches.\n\nI should also make sure there are no other relevant rows that might affect this conclusion. Checking the rest of the table confirms that these are the only relevant matches for both teams mentioned in the claim.\n\nSo, based on the data provided, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"only 1 match be play in february\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim means.\n\nThe claim says that only one match was played in February. So, I'm looking for any rows in the table where the date falls within February. The rest of the matches should be in January 1976 if this is true.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\n- Rows 1 to 3: All have dates on 24 January 1976.\n- Row 4: Date is 2 February 1976.\n- Rows 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18: All have dates on 24 January 1976.\n- Row 7: Date is 27 January 1976 (replay).\n- Rows 9 and 16: Dates are 28 January 1976.\n\nSo, only row 4 has a date in February. That's just one match played on 2nd February. All other matches are either in January or later in the same month but not extending into March or beyond. Therefore, the claim that only one match was played in February is correct.\n\nI need to make sure I'm counting correctly. Let me list all rows and their dates:\n\nRow 1: 24 Jan\nRow 2: 24 Jan\nRow 3: 24 Jan\nRow 4: 2 Feb\nRow 5: 24 Jan\nRow 6: 24 Jan\nRow 7: 27 Jan (replay)\nRow 8: 24 Jan\nRow 9: 28 Jan (replay)\nRow 10: 24 Jan\nRow 11: 24 Jan\nRow 12: 24 Jan\nRow 13: 24 Jan\nRow 14: 24 Jan\nRow 15: 24 Jan\nRow 16: 27 Jan (replay)\nRow 17: 24 Jan\nRow 18: 24 Jan\n\nYes, only row 4 has a February date.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the number of goals scored by Chelsea be double that score by Crystal Palace\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It states that Chelsea's goal count should be twice as much as Crystal Palace's. So, I'm looking for instances where both teams are involved in a match and checking their respective scores.\n\nLooking through the table rows:\n\n- Row 17: Home team is Leeds United (0), Away team is Crystal Palace (1). Here, Crystal Palace scored once.\n- No other row mentions Chelsea or Crystal Palace except Row 18. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, in Row 18: Home team is York City (0), away team is Chelsea (2). So Chelsea scored 2 goals here. \n\nNow, checking if Crystal Palace's score is half of Chelsea's. Crystal Palace has 1 goal (from Row 17) and Chelsea has 2 goals (Row 18). Is 2 equal to double of 1? Yes, it is.\n\nBut wait, are these two different ties? In Row 17, Crystal Palace scored against Leeds United, and in Row 18, Chelsea scored against York City. So, their scores are from separate matches. The claim doesn't specify they have to be in the same match, just overall. So, adding up all goals:\n\n- Chelsea's total: They only appear once (Row 18) with 2 goals.\n- Crystal Palace's total: They only appear once (Row 17) with 1 goal.\n\nSo, 2 is double of 1. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"only 1 of the 3 drawn match be goalless\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that only one of the three drawn matches was goalless. So, there are two parts here: identifying all the drawn matches and then checking if exactly one of them had a score of 0-0.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like tie number, home team, score, away team, and date. I'll go through each row to spot the draws.\n\nStarting from Row 1: Southampton vs Blackpool, the score is 3-1, so that's not a draw. \n\nRow 2: Leicester City vs Bury, 1-0 \u2013 no draw there either.\n\nRow 3: West Bromwich Albion vs Lincoln City, 3-2 \u2013 still not a draw.\n\nRow 4: Sunderland vs Hull City, 1-0 \u2013 not a draw.\n\nRow 5: Derby County vs Liverpool, 1-0 \u2013 again, not a draw.\n\nRow 6: Ipswich Town vs Wolverhampton Wanderers, the score is 0-0. That's a draw and also goalless because both teams scored zero goals. So this is one of the drawn matches that's goalless.\n\nMoving on to Row 7: This is a replay between Wolves and Ipswich, with a score of 1-0. Not a draw.\n\nRow 8: Coventry City vs Newcastle United, 1-1 \u2013 another draw. However, since both teams scored once each, it's not goalless. So this is a drawn match but not goalless.\n\nRow 9: Another replay between Newcastle and Coventry, with a score of 5-0. Not a draw.\n\nRow 10: Manchester United vs Peterborough, 3-1 \u2013 no draw.\n\nRow 11: Norwich City vs Luton Town, 2-0 \u2013 not a draw.\n\nRow 12: Bradford City vs Tooting & Mitcham United, 3-1 \u2013 still not a draw.\n\nRow 13: Southend United vs Cardiff City, 2-1 \u2013 nope.\n\nRow 14: Huddersfield Town vs Bolton Wanderers, 0-1 \u2013 again, not a draw.\n\nRow 15: Charlton Athletic vs Portsmouth, 1-1. This is another draw, but both teams scored once each, so it's not goalless.\n\nRow 16: A replay between Portsmouth and Charlton, with a score of 0-3 \u2013 definitely not a draw.\n\nRows 17 to 19 don't have any draws either.\n\nSo from the table, I identified three drawn matches:\n\n1. Row 6: 0-0 (goalless)\n2. Row 8: 1-1\n3. Row 15: 1-1\n\nOut of these three, only one (Row 6) was goalless. Therefore, the claim that \"only 1 of the 3 drawn match be goalless\" is TRUE.\n\nI'll note down the relevant cells which are Rows 6, 8, and 15 with their respective scores to support this conclusion.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"newcastle united score 3 more goals in their replayed match than manchester unite do in their match.\" \n\nFirst, I need to find Newcastle United's replayed match. Looking through the table, I see that in Row 8, there's a tie no:7 between Coventry City and Newcastle United with a score of 1-1 on 24 January 1976. Then, in Row 9, it's a replay for tie no:replay where Newcastle United is the home team against Coventry City, scoring 5-0. So Newcastle scored 5 goals in their replay.\n\nNext, I need to find Manchester United's match. In Row 10, tie no:8 shows Manchester United as the home team against Peterborough United with a score of 3-1 on 24 January 1976. So Manchester United scored 3 goals in that match.\n\nNow, checking if Newcastle scored 3 more than Manchester. Newcastle scored 5, and Manchester scored 3. The difference is exactly 2 goals, not 3. Therefore, the claim is false because Newcastle didn't score 3 more goals; they only scored 2 more.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells show that Newcastle United scored 5 in their replay (Row 9) and Manchester United scored 3 in their match (Row 10).

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"2 match be replay in january 1976\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that there were two matches that required a replay in January 1976. A replay typically happens when the initial match ends in a draw, so teams have to play again to determine a winner.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different tie number and includes details like home team, score, away team, and date. Some rows also mention \"replay\" as the tie number. These are likely the matches that were replayed because the initial game was tied.\n\nLet me go through each row to count how many replays occurred in January 1976.\n\nRow 1: Tie no: 1, Date: 24 January 1976. No mention of a replay here.\nRow 2: Tie no: 2, Date: 24 January 1976. No replay indicated.\nRow 3: Tie no: 3, Date: 24 January 1976. Again, not a replay.\nRow 4: Tie no: 4, Date: 2 February 1976. This is in February, so I'll skip it since the claim is about January.\nRow 5: Tie no: 5, Date: 24 January 1976. No replay here.\nRow 6: Tie no: 6, Score: 0-0, Date: 24 January 1976. This seems like a draw, which might lead to a replay. Let me check if there's a corresponding replay row for this tie.\n\nLooking further down:\nRow 7: Tie no: replay, Home team: Wolverhampton Wanderers vs Ipswich Town, Date: 27 January 1976. This is the replay for Tie no:6 since the initial match was a draw (0-0). So that's one replay.\n\nContinuing with Row 8:\nTie no:7, Score:1-1, Date:24 January 1976. Another draw, so likely to have a replay. Checking if there's a corresponding row.\n\nRow 9: Tie no: replay, Home team: Newcastle United vs Coventry City, Date:28 January 1976. This must be the replay for Tie no:8, making it the second replay in January.\n\nRows 10 to 18 don't mention any replays or draws that would require a replay in January.\n\nRow 19: Tie no:16, Date:28 January 1976. Not related to a replay for January's initial matches.\n\nSo, I found two replays in January 1976:\n- The first replay is on 27 January (Row7) for Tie no:6.\n- The second replay is on 28 January (Row9) for Tie no:8.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"2 match be replay in january 1976\" is TRUE. \n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\nFor Row7: It's a replay with date 27 Jan 1976.\nRelevant columns are \"tie no\", \"home team\", \"score\", \"away team\", \"date\".\n\nSimilarly for Row9: Another replay on 28 Jan 1976.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are all in Rows 7 and 9 across all columns except maybe tie no since it's marked as 'replay' which indicates a replay.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim means. It seems like it might have a typo, especially since the phrase isn't very clear. The user wrote \"be pay,\" which could mean \"paid\" or maybe \"played.\" So, interpreting it as \"2 matches were played in February,\" that makes more sense.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like tie number, home team, score, away team, and date. I need to check how many of these matches have a date in February 1976.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Date is 24 January 1976 \u2192 January\n- Row 2: Same as above \u2192 January\n- Row 3: 24 January \u2192 January\n- Row 4: Date is 2 February \u2192 February. This counts as one match.\n- Row 5: 24 January \u2192 January\n- Row 6: 24 January \u2192 January\n- Row 7: 27 January \u2192 January (even though it's a replay, but still in January)\n- Row 8: 24 January \u2192 January\n- Row 9: 28 January \u2192 January\n- Row 10: 24 January \u2192 January\n- Row 11: 24 January \u2192 January\n- Row 12: 24 January \u2192 January\n- Row 13: 24 January \u2192 January\n- Row 14: 24 January \u2192 January\n- Row 15: 24 January \u2192 January\n- Row 16: 27 January \u2192 January\n- Row 17: 24 January \u2192 January\n- Row 18: 24 January \u2192 January\n- Row 19: 28 January \u2192 January\n\nWait, I almost missed Row 19. Let me check again. The date for Row 19 is 28 January 1976, so that's still in January.\n\nSo, looking through all the rows, only Row 4 has a date in February (2nd). That means there was only one match played in February according to the table. However, the claim states \"2 match be pay in february,\" which implies two matches were paid or played in February.\n\nTherefore, since only one match falls under February, the claim is not supported by the data provided. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the number of goals scored by Chelsea be less than that scored by Crystal Palace.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this correctly. The claim is comparing two teams: Chelsea and Crystal Palace. It's saying Chelsea's score (goals) is less than Crystal Palace's score. So I need to find both teams in the table and see how many goals each scored.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nI'll go through each row to spot where Chelsea or Crystal Palace are mentioned.\n\nRow 17: Tie No: 14, Home Team: Leeds United, Score: 0 - 1, Away Team: Crystal Palace, Date: 24 Jan 1976. Here, Crystal Palace is the away team and scored 1 goal because it's after the hyphen in the score.\n\nRow 18: Tie No: 15, Home Team: York City, Score: 0 - 2, Away Team: Chelsea, Date: 24 Jan 1976. So Chelsea is the away team here and they scored 2 goals (since it's after the hyphen).\n\nSo Crystal Palace scored 1 goal in their match against Leeds United, and Chelsea scored 2 goals in their match against York City.\n\nThe claim says Chelsea's score is less than Crystal Palace's. But Chelsea scored 2 and Crystal Palace only 1. So 2 is not less than 1; it's actually more. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant for this determination. The relevant columns here are 'home team', 'away team', and 'score'. For each of these rows (17 and 18), those columns are important because they show which teams scored how many goals.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Row 17: home team, away team, score\n- Row 18: home team, away team, score\n\nBut in terms of the structure required, I need to list each cell individually with their row indices and column names. So for row 17, it's columns 'home team', 'away team', and 'score'. Similarly for row 18.\n\nWait, but looking at the example provided earlier, it seems that only specific cells are needed\u2014those that directly relate to the claim. Since the claim is about goals scored by each team, I need to find which rows mention those teams as either home or away, then check their respective scores.\n\nSo for Crystal Palace: they're in row 17 as the away team with a score of 1. So row 17's 'away team' and 'score' columns are relevant.\n\nFor Chelsea: they're in row 18 as the away team with a score of 2. So row 18's 'away team' and 'score' columns are relevant.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Row 17, column 'away team'\n- Row 17, column 'score'\n- Row 18, column 'away team'\n- Row 18, column 'score'\n\nThus, these four cells directly relate to determining how many goals each team scored.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Chelsea scored more goals than Crystal Palace.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"all 3 of the drawn match be goalless\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. The user is saying that all three matches that ended in a draw had no goals scored (goalless). So, my task is to check each match that was a draw and see if any of them had goals.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row:\n\n1. Row 1: Southampton vs Blackpool - Score 3-1. Not a draw.\n2. Row 2: Leicester City vs Bury - Score 1-0. Not a draw.\n3. Row 3: West Bromwich Albion vs Lincoln City - Score 3-2. Not a draw.\n4. Row 4: Sunderland vs Hull City - Score 1-0. Not a draw.\n5. Row 5: Derby County vs Liverpool - Score 1-0. Not a draw.\n6. Row 6: Ipswich Town vs Wolverhampton Wanderers - Score 0-0. This is a draw with no goals, so it's goalless.\n7. Row 7: It's a replay between Wolves and Ipswich, but the initial match was already considered in row 6. The score here is 1-0, not relevant for draws.\n8. Row 8: Coventry City vs Newcastle United - Score 1-1. This is a draw, but there are goals (2 goals total). So it's a drawn match with goals.\n9. Row 9: Replay between Newcastle and Coventry. The initial was row 8, so this is not the first occurrence of a draw. The score here is 5-0, which isn't a draw.\n10. Row 10: Manchester United vs Peterborough - Score 3-1. Not a draw.\n11. Row 11: Norwich City vs Luton Town - Score 2-0. Not a draw.\n12. Row 12: Bradford City vs Tooting & Mitcham - Score 3-1. Not a draw.\n13. Row 13: Southend United vs Cardiff City - Score 2-1. Not a draw.\n14. Row 14: Huddersfield Town vs Bolton Wanderers - Score 0-1. Not a draw.\n15. Row 15: Charlton Athletic vs Portsmouth - Score 1-1. Another draw, but again with goals (2 goals total).\n16. Row 16: Replay between Portsmouth and Charlton. Initial was row 15, so not relevant here. The score is 0-3.\n17. Row 17: Leeds United vs Crystal Palace - Score 0-1. Not a draw.\n18. Row 18: York City vs Chelsea - Score 0-2. Not a draw.\n19. Row 19: Stoke City vs Manchester City - Score 1-0. Not a draw.\n\nSo, the drawn matches in the table are:\n- Row 6: 0-0 (goalless)\n- Row 8: 1-1 (with goals)\n- Row 15: 1-1 (with goals)\n\nThe claim states that all three drawn matches were goalless. However, rows 8 and 15 show that the draws did have goals. Therefore, not all drawn matches were goalless; some had goals.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there are drawn matches with goals.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
