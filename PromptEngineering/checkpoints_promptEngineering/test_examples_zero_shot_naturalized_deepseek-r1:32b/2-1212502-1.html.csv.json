    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"2012 have a nominated result\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the year mentioned is 2012. So I need to look through all rows in the table where the year is 2012. Looking at the table provided, I see that Row 24 and Row 25 have the year 2012. \n\nRow 24: The award is Teen Choice Award, category is Breakout Star Female, nominated work is Bunheads, result is Nominated.\nRow 25: The award is Critics' Choice Television Award, category is Best Actress in a Comedy Series, same nominated work, result is also Nominated.\n\nSo both rows for the year 2012 have \"nominated\" as their result. Now, the claim says that in 2012, there was a \"nominated result.\" Since both entries from 2012 are indeed nominated, that means the claim is supported by the data.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are Rows 24 and 25 under the 'result' column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true as there are rows in 2012 where the result was nominated.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"shrek be nominate for a tony award in 2009\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The claim mentions three key pieces of information: the work (\"Shrek\"), the award (\"Tony Award\"), and the year (2009). My task is to verify if \"Shrek\" was indeed nominated for a Tony Award in 2009.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan each row to find entries that match these criteria. The table has multiple rows, each representing an award nomination or win across different years and categories. \n\nStarting from the top, rows 1 through 4 are about 2002 awards, so those can be ignored since the claim is about 2009. Similarly, rows 5-8 are for 2005, which doesn't match either. Rows 9-13 are in 2006, and row 14 is 2008\u2014still not matching.\n\nRow 15 catches my attention because it mentions the year 2009. Let me check the details here: it's a Tony Award nomination for \"Shrek\" in the category of Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical, with the result being nominated. That seems to align perfectly with the claim.\n\nTo be thorough, I'll continue checking the remaining rows just in case there are multiple entries about \"Shrek\" or other relevant information. Rows 16-18 also mention \"Shrek\" but under different awards like Drama Desk Award and Outer Critics Circle Award, but they all pertain to 2009 as well. However, since the claim specifically mentions the Tony Award, row 15 is the most pertinent.\n\nI don't see any other entries for 2009 related to \"Shrek\" that contradict this information. Therefore, based on the data provided in row 15, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the table shows that \"Shrek\" was nominated for a Tony Award in 2009.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"nominated work\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if the claim \"in 2012, bunheads have win for breakout female star\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into parts:\n\n- **Year**: 2012\n- **Award**: It mentions \"breakout star female\", so I'm looking for an award that relates to this.\n- **Nominated Work**: Bunheads\n\nI'll start by filtering the table rows where the year is 2012. Looking through the table, Row 24 has the year 2012.\n\nNow, checking Row 24:\n\n- **Award**: Teen Choice Award\n- **Category**: Breakout Star Female\n- **Nominated Work**: Bunheads\n- **Result**: Nominated\n\nThe claim states that \"bunheads have win for breakout female star.\" However, in the table, the result is \"nominated,\" not \"won.\"\n\nTherefore, since the result was a nomination and not a win, the claim is FALSE.\n\nTo support this, I need to identify the relevant cells. The key pieces of information are:\n\n- **Row 24**, **Year**: Confirms it's in 2012.\n- **Row 24**, **Award**: Points to the Teen Choice Award.\n- **Row 24**, **Category**: Breakout Star Female, matching the claim.\n- **Row 24**, **Result**: Shows that it was only nominated.\n\nThese cells are essential because they directly address each part of the claim and reveal that the result was a nomination, not a win. Thus, there's no row where Bunheads won in 2012 for Breakout Female Star; it only got nominated.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"shrek 's nominated work win a drama award in 2009.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. So, we're looking at the year 2009 and the nominated work \"Shrek.\" The claim is about whether Shrek won a drama award that year.\n\nLooking through the table, I'll scan for entries where the year is 2009 and the nominated work is Shrek. Let me go row by row:\n\nRow 15: Year 2009, Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical, Shrek, Result: Nominated.\nRow 16: Year 2009, Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Actress in a Musical, Shrek, Result: Nominated.\nRow 17: Year 2009, Drama League Award, Distinguished Performance, Shrek, Result: Nominated.\nRow 18: Year 2009, Outer Critics Circle Award, Outstanding Actress in a Musical, Shrek, Result: Won.\n\nWait, so for Row 18, the result is \"Won.\" That means Shrek did win an award here. But what kind of award is it? It's the Outer Critics Circle Award in the category of Outstanding Actress in a Musical. \n\nBut the claim mentions \"a drama award.\" So I need to check if any of these awards are specifically drama awards or if they fall under that category.\n\nLooking at the table, Drama Desk and Drama League are part of the names, so maybe those are drama-related. But Shrek's results for 2009: in Row 15 (Tony), it was nominated but didn't win; same with Rows 16 and 17. Only Row 18 shows a win, which is Outer Critics Circle.\n\nWait, the claim says \"win a drama award.\" So if the award won is considered a drama award, then the claim would be TRUE. If not, it's FALSE.\n\nThe Outer Critics Circle Award is generally for theater awards and does include categories like Outstanding Actress in a Musical, which could be part of musicals rather than dramas. But sometimes these awards might have both drama and musical categories.\n\nHowever, looking at all the entries for 2009:\n\n- Shrek was nominated for Tony (Row15), Drama Desk (Row16), Drama League (Row17), and Outer Critics Circle (Row18). It only won the Outer Critics Circle. \n\nBut does the claim specify which award? It just says \"a drama award.\" So if any of these are considered drama awards, then Shrek won one.\n\nWait, let me think again: The claim is that Shrek's nominated work won a drama award in 2009. From the table, Shrek won an Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical. Is that a drama award? I'm not entirely sure because it's specifically for a musical category.\n\nBut maybe in this context, any award under a drama organization counts as a drama award. Since the Drama Desk and Drama League are associated with drama awards, but Shrek didn't win those; only the Outer Critics Circle was won. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"drama award\" refers to awards that are not necessarily tied to musicals. So if Shrek won in a category specifically for musicals, it might not be considered a drama award.\n\nTherefore, since Shrek's win is in a musical category and the claim specifies a drama award, the answer would be FALSE because even though it won an award, it was in a musical category, not a drama one.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is about whether \"Shrek\" won a drama award in 2009. From the table, Shrek only won the Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical. Since this is a musical category and not a drama award, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"nominated_work\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
