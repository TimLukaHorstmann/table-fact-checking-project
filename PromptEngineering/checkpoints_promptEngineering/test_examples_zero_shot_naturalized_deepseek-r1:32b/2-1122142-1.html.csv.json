    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"cesare perdisa have a time  / retire of + 6 lap\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying and how to verify it using the data given.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find where the driver's name is \"cesare perdisa\". Scanning down the rows:\n\n- Row 1: juan manuel fangio\n- Row 2: alfonso de portago peter collins\n- Row 3: jean behra\n- Row 4: jack fairman\n- Row 5: horace gould\n- Row 6: luigi villoresi\n- Row 7: cesare perdisa\n\nOkay, so Row 7 is the one with cesare perdisa. Now, I need to check the \"time / retired\" column for this row. Looking at Row 7's details:\n\n- Laps: 95\n- Time / Retired: +6 laps\n- Grid: 15\n\nThe claim says that cesare perdisa has a time/retire of \"+ 6 lap\". Comparing this to the table, it exactly matches. The \"time / retired\" field is indeed listed as \"+6 laps\", which aligns with the claim.\n\nI should also ensure there's no other driver named cesare perdisa in another row that might have a different time/retire value. Scanning through the rest of the rows quickly, I don't see any other entries for this driver. So it's confirmed that Row 7 is the only one and the information matches.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that cesare perdisa has a \"time / retired\" of +6 laps. Checking Row 7 in the table confirms this information.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"time  / retired\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"cesare perdisa of brm have a time  / retire of + 6 lap with 18 grid\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim into its components:\n1. Driver's name: Cesare Perdisa\n2. Constructor: BRM\n3. Time/Retire status: +6 laps\n4. Grid position: 18\n\nNext, I'll go through each row in the table to find if there's a driver named Cesare Perdisa.\n\nLooking at Row 7:\n- Driver: cesare perdisa\n- Constructor: maserati\n- Laps: 95\n- Time/Retired: +6 laps\n- Grid: 15\n\nHmm, the driver is indeed Cesare Perdisa. However, his constructor is listed as Maserati, not BRM. Also, his grid position is 15, not 18.\n\nSo, two parts of the claim don't match: the constructor and the grid number. Since both are incorrect, the entire claim isn't supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Cesare Perdisa from BRM has a time/retire status of +6 laps with grid 18. However, according to the table, Cesare Perdisa is associated with Maserati and has a grid position of 15.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"time  / retired\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"robert manzon who have 88 lap with a maserati have average 22 grid.\" I need to determine if this statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim into its components:\n1. Driver's name: Robert Manzon.\n2. Laps completed: 88.\n3. Constructor: Maserati.\n4. Grid position average: 22.\n\nNow, I'll go through each part to verify against the table.\n\nStarting with the driver's name, Robert Manzon. Looking at the table, row 9 mentions \"robert manzon\" as the driver. So that's correct.\n\nNext, checking the laps for Robert Manzon. In row 9, under the laps column, it shows 94 laps. The claim says he completed 88 laps, which doesn't match. This discrepancy might indicate a problem with the claim.\n\nNow, regarding the constructor. The claim states Maserati, but in row 9, Robert Manzon's constructor is listed as Gordini, not Maserati. So this part of the claim is also incorrect.\n\nLastly, the grid position average of 22. In row 9, his grid position is 18. There's no mention of an average; it seems the claim might be conflating different data points or perhaps misinterpreting the information.\n\nWait a second, maybe I should check other rows in case there are multiple entries for Robert Manzon. Scanning through all rows, I don't see another entry for him. So he only appears once in row 9 with Gordini, 94 laps, and grid 18.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions an average grid position of 22. However, the table doesn't provide any averages; it shows individual race data. Therefore, discussing an average isn't applicable here as each entry is a single instance without repeated data to compute an average from.\n\nMoreover, looking at all rows, there's no driver with Maserati who has exactly 88 laps. The closest is row 3: Jean Behra with Maserati and 99 laps, but that's not 88 either. So the combination of Robert Manzon having 88 laps with Maserati doesn't exist in this table.\n\nTherefore, each component of the claim\u2014laps, constructor, grid position\u2014is incorrect based on the data provided. The only correct part is the driver's name, but since all other details don't align, the entire claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
