    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"there be only 1 person who have zero loss so far\" is true based on the given data table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim means. It says that there's only one person with zero losses so far. That probably refers to someone who has never lost a fight in their career up until now. So, looking at each row of the table, which represents a fighter and their performance, I need to check how many fighters have zero losses.\n\nLooking at the table, each row lists details like the person's name (though it seems repetitive), their record after the fight, the opponent, method of victory or loss, event, round, time, location. The key here is the \"record\" column, which shows wins and losses. For example, in row 0: the record is 1-2, meaning one win and two losses.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the data provided, each row seems to be a fight result for the same person because the names are repeating. Wait no, maybe not. Let me check again. The rows start with different opponents but I think all these fights are for the same individual, perhaps named something else not shown here. Or maybe each row is a separate fighter? Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, looking at the data more carefully, it seems like the table is listing multiple fighters' fight records. Each row represents a different person and their respective record after a specific fight. So for example, in row 0: \"there be only 1 person who have zero loss so far\" - but that might not be correct. Wait no, actually, each row seems to represent an individual's overall record at the time of that particular fight.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify. Each row likely represents a different fighter's career stats up to a certain point. So for example, in row 0: the person has 1-2 record (one win, two losses). Then row 1 shows another person with 3-1, meaning three wins and one loss.\n\nWait no, looking at the data:\n\nRow 0:\n\"res\": \"win\",\n\"record\": \"1-2\"\n\nSo that's a fighter who has 1 win and 2 losses so far. Next row:\n\nRow 1:\n\"res\": \"loss\",\n\"record\": \"3-1\"\n\nThat would be a different fighter, with three wins and one loss.\n\nWait, but the problem is that each row might not represent a separate person; it's possible that all these fights are for the same individual. Because in some rows, like row 27 and 28, both have events at UFC 13 in Augusta, Georgia, so perhaps those two fights were by different fighters.\n\nWait, no, I think each row is a separate fight event but not necessarily a different person. This is getting confusing because the data isn't clearly structured with fighter names or IDs. So maybe it's better to consider that each row represents a single fight for an individual, and we need to see if any of these individuals have zero losses in their overall record.\n\nBut I'm now confused about whether each row is a separate person or just different fights for the same person(s). Let me think again: the table seems to list various opponents and outcomes. For example, in row 28, someone named Wes Albritton has a fight result of Tko (punches) with a record of 1-0, meaning one win and zero losses. Then in row 27, another person (Guy Mezger?) had a submission loss with a record of 1-1.\n\nWait, perhaps each fighter's name is not explicitly listed here; instead, the rows are just different fights. But without knowing which fighter is being referred to, it's impossible to tell if any have zero losses overall.\n\nWait no, looking again, perhaps each row represents a single fight for an individual, and their record after that fight. So to find out who has zero losses so far, I need to look at the \"record\" column across all rows and see how many fighters have zero losses in their current record.\n\nBut since each row is a different fight, it's possible that the same fighter appears multiple times with updated records. For example, if someone starts with 1-0 (win), then later has 2-0, etc., but I can't tell because each row seems to be an individual event for different people.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently: the claim is that only one person has zero losses so far. So in the entire dataset, there should be exactly one fighter whose current record shows zero losses (i.e., their loss count is 0).\n\nLooking through each row's \"record\" field:\n\nRow 0: 1-2 \u2192 two losses\nRow 1: 3-1 \u2192 one loss\nRow 2: 4-1 \u2192 one loss\n...\nWait, actually, looking at all the rows provided in the data, I don't see any record where the loss count is zero. For example:\n\nRow 28: \"record\": \"1-0\" (one win, zero losses)\nYes! So row 28 shows a fighter with a record of 1-0, meaning one win and zero losses. That's the only instance I can find in the data where the loss count is zero.\n\nSo according to this, there is exactly one person (from the rows provided) who has zero losses so far. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that only one person has zero losses so far is true based on the data provided. The fighter with a record of 1-0 in row 28 is the sole individual without any losses.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nYes, the claim is true. There is exactly one person (row 28) with a record of 1-0, indicating zero losses.\n\n\\boxed{True}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is that \"wes albritton be 1 of 7 people who have tko win.\" I need to verify if this is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking through each row in the table to see where Wes Albritton appears and check the result. \n\nLooking at Row 28: The opponent is Wes Albritton, and the method of victory is \"tko (punches)\". So, this indicates that Wes Albritton was defeated by a TKO via punches.\n\nNext, I need to determine how many people have a TKO win in the table. That means looking for any cell where the result is a win with the method being TKO. \n\nLet me scan each row:\n\n- Row 0: Method is \"tko (punches)\", Result is Win. So that's one.\n- Row 1: Submission, not TKO.\n- Row 2: Submission, not TKO.\n- ...\nContinuing through all rows, I'm noting each win by TKO.\n\nWait, actually, in the table provided, it seems that each row represents a match where the fighter either won or lost. So for each row, if the method is \"tko\" and the result is Win, that would count as a person who has a TKO win.\n\nSo I'll go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Result=Win, Method=tko (punches) \u2192 Count 1.\nRow 1: Submission \u2192 No.\nRow 2: Submission \u2192 No.\nRow 3: tko (punches & elbows), Win \u2192 Count 2.\nRow 4: ko (slam), Win \u2192 Not TKO.\nRow 5: submission \u2192 No.\nRow 6: decision \u2192 No.\nRow 7: submission, loss \u2192 Not a win.\nRow 8: tko, loss \u2192 Doesn't count as a win.\nRow 9: decision \u2192 No.\nRow 10: ko \u2192 No.\nRow 11: submission, loss \u2192 No.\nRow 12: submission (punches), loss \u2192 No.\nRow 13: tko (punches), Win \u2192 Count 3.\nRow 14: decision \u2192 No.\nRow 15: submission \u2192 No.\nRow 16: tko, Win \u2192 Count 4.\nRow 17: tko, Win \u2192 Count 5.\nRow 18: submission \u2192 No.\nRow 19: tko (punches & elbows), Win \u2192 Count 6.\nRow 20: ko \u2192 No.\nRow 21: submission \u2192 No.\nRow 22: decision \u2192 No.\nRow 23: loss, method=Submission \u2192 No.\nRow 24: tko (punches), Win \u2192 Count 7.\nRow 25: tko (cut), Win \u2192 Count 8.\nRow 26: submission, loss \u2192 No.\nRow 27: tko (punches), Win \u2192 Wait, Row 27's result is a win? Let me check again. \n\nWait, no. Looking back:\n\nRow 26: Result is \"loss\", method=Submission.\n\nRow 27: Opponent is Guy Mezger, Method=\"submission (guillotine choke)\", Result=Loss \u2192 Doesn't count as a win by TKO.\n\nRow 28: Opponent is Wes Albritton, Method=\"tko (punches)\", Result=Win. Wait, no, in the table provided, it's:\n\nRow 27: Loss against Guy Mezger via submission.\nRow 28: Win against Wes Albritton via tko.\n\nWait, that would be another TKO win. So that makes Row 0,3,13,16,17,19,24,25, and 28 as wins by TKO. That's more than seven people.\n\nBut wait, the claim is that Wes Albritton is one of seven people who have a TKO win. So I need to check if there are exactly seven such cases where someone has a TKO win.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\nRows with \"Result\" as Win and Method as TKO:\n\nRow 0: Yes.\nRow 3: Yes.\nRow 13: Yes.\nRow 16: Yes.\nRow 17: Yes.\nRow 19: Yes.\nRow 24: Yes.\nRow 25: Yes (tko via cut, so yes).\nRow 28: Yes.\n\nThat's nine rows where the result is a win by TKO. So there are more than seven people who have TKO wins. \n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe \"7 people\" refers to seven opponents defeated by TKO. In that case, each row represents an opponent defeated, so if there are seven such rows where the method was TKO and result was Win, then it would be correct.\n\nBut in this table, there are more than seven such instances. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because there are more than seven people who have been defeated by TKO, making Wes Albritton one of nine or so.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me list them:\n\nRow 0: Win via tko.\nRow 3: Win via tko.\nRow 13: Win via tko.\nRow 16: Win via tko.\nRow 17: Win via tko.\nRow 19: Win via tko.\nRow 24: Win via tko.\nRow 25: Win via tko (cut).\nRow 28: Win via tko.\n\nThat's nine wins by TKO. So there are nine people defeated by TKO, not seven. Therefore, the claim that Wes is one of seven would be incorrect; he is one of nine.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the original table. Let me double-check each row:\n\nRow 0: Win via tko.\nYes.\n\nRow 1: Submission, loss \u2192 No.\n\nRow 2: Submission, win \u2192 No, not TKO.\n\nRow 3: tko (punches), Win \u2192 Yes.\n\nRow 4: ko, Win \u2192 No.\n\nRow 5: submission, Win \u2192 No.\n\nRow 6: decision, Win \u2192 No.\n\nRow 7: submission, loss \u2192 No.\n\nRow 8: tko, loss \u2192 No.\n\nRow 9: decision, loss \u2192 No.\n\nRow 10: ko, Win \u2192 No.\n\nRow 11: submission, loss \u2192 No.\n\nRow 12: submission (punches), loss \u2192 No.\n\nRow 13: tko, Win \u2192 Yes.\n\nRow 14: decision, loss \u2192 No.\n\nRow 15: submission, Win \u2192 No.\n\nRow 16: tko, Win \u2192 Yes.\n\nRow 17: tko, Win \u2192 Yes.\n\nRow 18: submission, loss \u2192 No.\n\nRow 19: tko (punches & elbows), Win \u2192 Yes.\n\nRow 20: ko, Win \u2192 No.\n\nRow 21: submission, Win \u2192 No.\n\nRow 22: decision, Win \u2192 No.\n\nRow 23: submission, loss \u2192 No.\n\nRow 24: tko, Win \u2192 Yes.\n\nRow 25: tko (cut), Win \u2192 Yes.\n\nRow 26: submission, loss \u2192 No.\n\nRow 27: tko, loss \u2192 No.\n\nRow 28: tko, Win \u2192 Yes.\n\nSo that's rows 0,3,13,16,17,19,24,25,28 \u2192 nine instances where the result was a win via TKO. Therefore, there are nine people who have been defeated by TKO in this table, making Wes Albritton one of nine, not seven.\n\nHence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Wes Albritton is one of seven individuals with a TKO victory. Upon reviewing the table, we found nine instances where opponents were defeated by TKO. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false; there are nine such cases, not seven.

Round number: 4\n\nNow, I'll go through each row in the table to find any entries where Forest Griffin is mentioned and check if he had a KO in round 4.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Rows are indexed from 0 to 27.\n- I'm looking for \"Forest Griffin\" in the opponent's name since the table lists other fighters' opponents. Wait, actually, checking each row, it seems that the table is listing matches where the person being referred to (maybe a specific fighter) has opponents listed under \"opponent.\" So perhaps I need to look for Forest Griffin as an opponent.\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. The table likely lists the fights of a single fighter, with each row representing a different opponent they've faced. So the \"opponent\" column would be other fighters. Therefore, to check if Forest Griffin has a KO in round 4, I should look for rows where \"Forest Griffin\" is listed as the opponent and see if the method was a KO and the round was 4.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 18: Opponent is Vladimir Matyushenko, method is Decision (Unanimous), Round 5. Not relevant.\n\nRow 20: Opponent is Evan Tanner, method is KO via Slam, Round 1. So this fighter knocked out Evan Tanner in round 1, not Forest Griffin.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the table is about someone else's fights, and we're checking if Forest Griffin has a KO in round 4 against this person or anyone else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is that Forest Griffin himself had a KO win in round 4, so I should look for any row where the opponent is Forest Griffin and method is KO in round 4. Alternatively, perhaps the table lists all of Forest Griffin's fights, but from the data provided, it seems like the table is about another fighter, maybe someone else.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The user provided a list of rows with fight details, each row representing a different opponent. So for example, in row 19, the opponent is Elvis Sinosic, method is TKO via punches and elbows, round 1. So perhaps this table is about a single fighter's career, listing their opponents, methods, etc.\n\nSo to check if Forest Griffin has a KO in round 4 against this fighter, I need to see if any row lists Forest Griffin as the opponent with a method of KO in round 4.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nRow 21: Opponent is Yuki Kondo, method Submission (Cobra Choke), Round 1. Not relevant.\nRow 22: Opponent Wanderlei Silva, Decision (Unanimous), Round 5.\nRow 23: Opponent Frank Shamrock, Submission via punches, Round 4, time 4:42.\nHmm, that's a submission in round 4 against Frank Shamrock.\n\nLooking for \"Forest Griffin\" as opponent. Scanning through all rows:\n\nI don't see Forest Griffin listed as an opponent in any row. So this table doesn't have any entries where the opponent is Forest Griffin with a KO finish in round 4.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no such entry in the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"Forest Griffin has a KO in round 4.\" After examining each relevant cell in the table, there are no instances where Forest Griffin is listed as an opponent with a KO finish in round 4. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"2 of the fight be decide in round 1\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, understanding the claim: It states that two fights were decided in the first round. So, I'm looking for rows where the 'round' column indicates round 1 and the outcome was a decision (like KO, TKO, submission).\n\nLooking at each row of the table:\n\n- Row 0: Round 1, ended with a submission (Cobra Choke) - this counts.\n- Row 1: Round 5, so not relevant.\n- Row 2: Round 4, no.\n- Row 3: Round 1, TKO via punches and elbows. That's another one.\n- Row 4: Round 1, KO via a slam. This is the third fight decided in round 1.\nWait, but the claim says \"2 of the fight be decide in round 1\". So according to this, there are three fights that ended in round 1.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check each row again carefully.\n\nLet me list out all rows where 'round' is 1:\n\nRow 0: Round 1\nRow 3: Round 1 (Evan Tanner)\nRow 4: Round 1 (Yuki Kondo)\nRow 19: Round 1 (Elvis Sinosic)\nWait, no. Let me correct that.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRows:\n- Row 20: Opponent Evan Tanner, round 1.\n- Row 21: Opponent Yuki Kondo, round 1.\n- Row 19: Opponent Elvis Sinosic, round 1.\nSo actually, there are three fights decided in round 1.\n\nBut the claim says two. So why did I think three earlier? Let me recount:\n\nLooking at each row's 'round' column:\n\nRow 0: Round 1\nRow 20: Round 1\nRow 21: Round 1\nSo that's three fights decided in round 1.\n\nBut the claim is \"2 of the fight be decide in round 1\". So according to this, it should be TRUE because there are more than two. Wait, but maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps some rows don't have the outcome in round 1. Let me check each relevant row:\n\nRow 0: Opponent Yuki Kondo, method submission (Cobra Choke), round 1 - yes.\nRow 20: Opponent Evan Tanner, method KO (slam), round 1 - yes.\nRow 21: Opponent Yuki Kondo, method submission ( Cobra Choke) in round 1? Wait no, looking back:\n\nWait the rows are ordered from row 0 to row 28. Let me list them correctly.\n\nActually, upon reviewing the data provided, I see that some of the fights listed have 'round' as 1, but let's count how many were decided in round 1.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: Round 1 - yes.\nRow 1: Round 5 - no.\n...\nRow 20: Opponent Evan Tanner, round 1, method KO (slam) - yes.\nRow 21: Opponent Yuki Kondo, method submission ( Cobra Choke), round 1 - yes.\nSo that's three fights decided in round 1. Therefore, the claim says two, but there are actually three. So the answer would be TRUE because at least two were decided in round 1.\n\nWait, no, the claim is \"2 of the fight be decide in round 1\". Since there are three, it still satisfies the condition that at least two were decided in round 1. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nBut I think the user might have meant exactly two. If so, then it's false because there are three. But since the claim says \"2 of the fight be decide\", not specifying whether more aren't allowed, just that at least two were decided in round 1, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in counting and only found two. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at the data again:\n\nRow 0: Round 1\nRow 20: Round 1\nRow 21: Round 1\n\nYes, three fights decided in round 1. Therefore, the claim that \"2 of the fight be decide in round 1\" is true because two (and more) were decided in round 1.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE with the relevant cells being rows where 'round' is 1 and method indicates a decision.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"in the chart only 1 fight be decide unanimously\" is true or false based on the provided data. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim means. It says that in the entire chart (which is a list of fights), there's only one fight where the decision was made unanimously. A unanimous decision typically means that all judges agreed on the outcome, so it wasn't split or based on points but rather a clear victory.\n\nLooking at the data provided, each row represents a fight with details like opponent, method, round, time, and location. The key column here is the \"method\" because it tells us how the fight ended. I'm specifically looking for fights where the result was decided by a unanimous decision. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one to check if any of them mention a \"unanimous decision\" in the method column.\n\nRow 0: The method is \"submission (cobra choke)\". No mention of a unanimous decision here.\nRow 1: Method is \"decision (unanimous)\" \u2014 this looks like it's a unanimous decision. I'll note this as one instance.\nRow 2: Submission via punches. Not a decision, so no.\nRow 3: TKO via punches and elbows. Again, not a decision.\nRow 4: Decision (unanimous) again. Wait, that's another one. So now there are two instances where the method is a unanimous decision.\n\nContinuing further:\nRow 5: Submission via guillotine choke \u2014 no.\nRow 6: KO via punches \u2014 no.\nRow 7: Submission via corner stoppage \u2014 no.\nRow 8: Decision (unanimous) once more. That's three now.\n\nWait, the claim says only one fight was decided by a unanimous decision, but I'm already at three in the first few rows. Let me check all to be thorough.\n\nLooking through all rows, any mention of \"decision\" with \"unanimous\" is what we're after.\n\nRows 1, 8, and others might have this. Wait, let's count them properly:\n\nRow 1: Decision (Unanimous) \u2014 yes.\nRow 4: Decision (Unanimous) \u2014 yes.\nRow 8: Decision (Unanimous) \u2014 yes.\nAlso, checking rows beyond that:\nRow 23: Submission via punches \u2014 no.\nRow 25: TKO via cut \u2014 no.\nSo, in the data provided, there are multiple instances where fights were decided by a unanimous decision.\n\nTherefore, the claim that only one fight was decided unanimously is false because there's more than one such case. The relevant cells are those where the method column indicates a \"decision (unanimous)\", which occurs in rows 1, 4, and 8.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because multiple fights were decided by unanimous decisions as seen in rows 1, 4, and 8.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
