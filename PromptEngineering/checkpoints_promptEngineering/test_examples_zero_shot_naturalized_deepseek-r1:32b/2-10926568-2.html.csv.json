    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the title of the episode that aired on march 31, 2008 be, new york : secret societies.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what the claim is stating. It mentions two key pieces of information: the airdate (March 31, 2008) and the episode title (\"New York: Secret Societies\"). The task is to check if this statement aligns with the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row contains details about different episodes. Each row has the following columns: production no, episode no, original airdate, episode title, and host. \n\nTo verify the claim, I need to find the row where the original airdate is March 31, 2008. Once I locate that row, I can check if the episode title matches \"New York: Secret Societies.\"\n\nStarting from Row 1, I go through each row's original airdate:\n\n- Row 1: January 28, 2008\n- Row 2: February 4, 2008\n- Row 3: February 11, 2008\n- Row 4: February 25, 2008\n- Row 5: March 3, 2008\n- Row 6: March 10, 2008\n- Row 7: March 17, 2008\n- Row 8: March 24, 2008\n- Row 9: March 31, 2008\n\nAh, here we go. Row 9 has the original airdate as March 31, 2008. Now, checking the episode title in this row: it's \"New York : secret societies.\" \n\nComparing this to the claim, the titles are identical except for minor punctuation differences (like the colon and spaces), but they convey the same information. Therefore, the claim is accurate based on the table data.\n\nSo, the relevant cells here are from Row 9, specifically the \"original airdate\" and \"episode title\" columns. These two pieces of information confirm that the episode airing on March 31, 2008, indeed has the title mentioned in the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"episode number 202 air on february 4 , 2008\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It states that episode number 202 was aired on February 4, 2008. So I need to check if this information matches any row in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with details like production number, episode number, airdate, title, and host. Since the claim mentions episode number 202, I should search for that specific episode number in the 'episode no' column.\n\nStarting from Row 1: Production No 15 is Episode 201. Not matching 202.\n\nRow 2: Production No 16 is Episode 202. This matches. Now, checking the airdate for this row. The original airdate is February 4, 2008. \n\nSo according to Row 2, Episode 202 was indeed aired on February 4, 2008. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells. The episode number and airdate are key here. In Row 2 (index starts at 1?), but wait, in programming sometimes indices start at 0. Let me confirm: the table has rows starting from Row 1 as index 1? Or is it zero-based?\n\nWait, looking back at the example provided in the instructions, they used \"row_index\": 0 and 1. So assuming that rows are zero-indexed. Therefore, Row 2 would be row_index 1.\n\nBut actually, in the table given, each row is listed from 1 to 13. But when considering arrays or lists in code, we index starting at 0. Wait no, perhaps in the problem statement, it's presented as rows 1-13, but for the JSON output, the 'row_index' should be zero-based. Let me double-check.\n\nIn the example provided by the user, they have \"row_index\": 0 and 1, which suggests that row indexing starts at 0. So Row 2 in naturalized format would correspond to row index 1 in the JSON output.\n\nWait no, looking back: The table has rows from 1 to 13 as per the description. But in code, when you have a list, indices start at 0. Therefore, Row 1 is index 0, Row 2 is index 1, etc.\n\nTherefore, for Episode No 202 which is in Row 2 (as presented), it's row_index 1.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- For Episode Number: column 'episode no' at row 1.\n- For Airdate: column 'original airdate' at row 1.\n\nHence, the JSON should include these two cells as relevant_cells.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE and the relevant cells are in Row 2 (index 1) for both episode number and original airdate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"episode no\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a table with several rows, each representing an episode of a show. Each row has details like production number, episode number, original airdate, episode title, and host. The claim is about whether the episode that aired on January 28, 2008, is titled \"Vietnam\" and hosted by Don Wildman.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table to find the row where the original airdate matches January 28, 2008. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 1 has an airdate of January 28, 2008.\n- The episode title for this row is \"Underground Apocalypse\".\n- The host is Don Wildman.\n\nNow, comparing this to the claim:\n- The claim states the episode title is \"Vietnam\" on that date. However, Row 1 shows it's \"Underground Apocalypse\", not \"Vietnam\".\n- The host is correctly mentioned as Don Wildman in both the table and the claim.\n  \nWait a second, looking again at Row 2:\n- It has an airdate of February 4, 2008, which doesn't match January 28.\nBut the title here is \"Vietnam\". So, the episode titled \"Vietnam\" actually aired later than January 28.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the episode that aired on January 28 isn't \"Vietnam\"; it's another title. The correct title should be \"Underground Apocalypse\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"},\n     {\"row_1\": 0, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"episode number 213 air on january 28, 2008\". \n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. Each row represents an episode with several details: production no, episode no, original airdate, episode title, and host.

Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Episode No 201\n- Row 2: Episode No 202\n- ...\n- Continuing down, I see that Row 13 has Production No 27 and Episode No 213. So, this is the relevant row for the claim.\n\nNext, I check the original airdate for episode 213 in Row 13. The date listed is May 5, 2008. \n\nThe claim states that episode 213 aired on January 28, 2008. Comparing this to the table, the actual airdate is different. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because the airdate in the table doesn't match the date mentioned in the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 12,\n       \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",
