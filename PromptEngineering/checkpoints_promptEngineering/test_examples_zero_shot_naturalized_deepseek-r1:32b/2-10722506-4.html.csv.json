The cities listed in the Midwest are Notre Dame (Indiana), Nashville (Tennessee), Ames (Iowa), and Salt Lake City (Utah). None of these include Norman OK, Piscataway NJ, Gainesville FL, or Durham NC.\n\nNow, looking at where those cities actually are:\n\nNorman, Oklahoma: It's in the West region (Row 13).\nPiscataway, New Jersey: Also in the West region (Row 14).\nGainesville, Florida: West region as well (Row 15).\nDurham, North Carolina: West region too (Row 16).\n\nSo all four cities mentioned are actually under the West region, not Midwest. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim lists four cities and states as being in the Midwest region, but upon checking the table, these entries are found in the West region instead.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"city\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
