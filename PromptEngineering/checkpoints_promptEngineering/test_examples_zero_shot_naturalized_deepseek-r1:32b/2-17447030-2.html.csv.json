    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"only 1 fighter have a 5 - 3 record\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table and check the 'record' column to see if there are any fighters with a 5-3 record. The claim states that only one fighter has such a record, so my goal is to count how many times the record 5-3 appears.\n\nStarting with Row 1: The record here is 6 - 4 (1). That's not 5-3.\nRow 2: Record is 5 - 4 (1). Still not 5-3.\nRow 3: Record is 5 - 3 (1). Okay, that's the first occurrence of a 5-3 record. So that's one fighter so far.\n\nMoving on to Row 4: The record is 5 - 2 (1). Not 5-3.\nRow 5: Record is 4 - 2 (1). No match here.\nRow 6: Record is 3 - 2 (1). Still not matching.\nRow 7: Here, the record is 3 - 1 (1), but this row also mentions 'nc' which I think stands for no contest. So it doesn't affect the count of wins and losses directly.\nRow 8: The record drops to 3 - 1, so definitely not 5-3.\nRows 9 through 11 all have records lower than 5-3 or different win-loss counts.\n\nSo from this analysis, only Row 3 has a 5-3 record. Therefore, the claim that only one fighter has a 5-3 record is correct because there's exactly one instance of it in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"when the opponent be dan severn , the method be submission (arm triangle choke) and the event be ufc japan : ultimate japan\". \n\nFirst, let me parse each part of the claim:\n\n1. Opponent: Dan Severn\n2. Method: Submission via arm triangle choke\n3. Event: UFC Japan: Ultimate Japan\n\nI need to check if there's a row in the table where all three conditions are met.\n\nLooking at the table rows one by one:\n\nRow 1: Opponent is Jonathan Ivey, method is TKO (punches), event is PFL - Genesis. Doesn't match.\nRow 2: Opponent is Wes Sims, method is TKO, event is Hooknshoot - Absolute Fighting Championships 1. Not a match.\nRow 3: Opponent is Dan Severn. Okay, that's a potential candidate. The method here is submission (arm triangle choke). So the first two conditions are met. Now check the event. It says WEF 9 - World Class. Hmm, not UFC Japan: Ultimate Japan. So this row doesn't satisfy all three conditions.\n\nContinuing to other rows in case there's another Dan Severn opponent:\n\nRow 4: Opponent is Maurice Smith.\nRow 5: Opponent is Patrick Smith.\nRow 6: Opponent is Kazushi Sakuraba, event is UFC Japan: Ultimate Japan. But opponent isn't Dan Severn here.\nRow 7: Again, opponent is Kazushi Sakuraba in the same event.\nRows 8-11 don't have Dan Severn as an opponent.\n\nSo only Row 3 has Dan Severn as the opponent with submission via arm triangle choke, but the event doesn't match. The event for that fight was WEF 9 - World Class, not UFC Japan.\n\nTherefore, none of the rows satisfy all three conditions in the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because although Dan Severn was an opponent with a submission (arm triangle choke) method, the event was not UFC Japan: Ultimate Japan. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
