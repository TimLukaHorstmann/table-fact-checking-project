    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to verify the claim: \"Danny Cipriani, born November 2, 1987, be a fly half.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has information about various players, their positions, birth dates, and other details. The claim is about Danny Cipriani's birth date and position.\n\nI'll start by searching for Danny Cipriani in the table. Scanning through the rows, I find that Danny Cipriani is listed at row 28 (assuming the first row after the header is index 0). \n\nLooking at row 28: The position is \"fly - half,\" which matches the claim's description of being a fly half. So the position part checks out.\n\nNext, I'll check the birth date. The table says Danny Cipriani was born on November 2, 1987. That exactly matches the claim. \n\nSo both parts of the claim are accurate according to the data in the table. Therefore, the claim is fully supported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"date_of_birth\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given data table. The claim says: \"the position of the player born on 2 November 1987 be fly-half, the only one for a Sale player.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down what this claim is asserting. It has two main parts:\n\n1. There's a player born on 2 November 1987 who plays as a fly-half.\n2. This player is the only one from Sale in that position.\n\nI'll start by looking through the table for players with the birthdate of 2 November 1987. Scanning each row, I notice Row 30 mentions \"danny cipriani\" born on 2 November 1987 and plays as a fly-half. So that checks out the first part.\n\nNow, I need to confirm if Danny Cipriani is the only Sale player in the fly-half position. Looking at other players with the club \"sale,\" I see:\n\n- Row 30: Danny Cipriani - Fly-half, Sale.\n- Row 41: Mark Cueto - Fullback, Sale.\n\nSo, there are two Sale players listed. However, only Danny Cipriani is a fly-half; the other, Mark Cueto, plays as a fullback. Therefore, in terms of fly-half position, Danny Cipriani is indeed the only Sale player.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if there are any other Sale players with fly-half positions. I go through each row again:\n\n- Rows 30 and 41 are the only ones with \"sale\" under club.\n- No other rows have both \"sale\" as the club and \"fly-half\" as the position.\n\nSo, yes, Danny Cipriani is the sole Sale player in the fly-half role. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because there's a player born on 2 November 1987 (Danny Cipriani) who plays fly-half for Sale, and he is the only one from that club in that position.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"club\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "prop steve borthwick be leicester 's best know player in that position",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"prop steve borthwick be leicester's best know player in that position\" is true or false based on the data provided in the table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim states that Steve Borthwick is Leicester's best-known player as a prop. To verify this, I should look at two main aspects: whether Steve Borthwick is listed as a prop in Leicester and if there are other props from Leicester who might be better known.\n\nLooking through the table, I see that each row contains information about a player, their position, club, etc. So I'll scan the \"position\" column to find all players listed as props and check their clubs.\n\nStarting with Row 0: It's a prop named Steve Borthwick, and his club is Leicester. That matches the claim.\n\nNext, I need to see if there are other props from Leicester. Let me go through each row where the position is \"prop\":\n\n- Row 0: Steve Borthwick, Leicester\n- Row 1: Brian Mujati, Leicester (position not specified as prop)\nWait, let me double-check that. Looking at the table again:\n\nLooking back, I realize that some players have positions mentioned, like \"prop\" or other roles. So maybe only certain rows are relevant.\n\nWait, actually, in the given data, Steve Borthwick is listed under position \"fly-half\", not prop. Hmm, that's confusing because the claim says he's a prop. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at Row 31: It mentions Jonny Wilkinson as fly-half from Newcastle. Wait, no, maybe I misread earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the positions are correctly noted. Let me go row by row:\n\nRow 0: Steve Borthwick is listed with position \"fly-half\" and club Leicester. But wait, in the data provided, looking at the rows, I think there might be a mistake here because Steve Borthwick is actually known as a prop, not a fly-half.\n\nWait no, perhaps the table has different information. Let me look again carefully:\n\nLooking through each row where position is \"prop\":\n\nRow 0: Position isn't listed as prop. Wait, maybe I need to check each row for the word \"prop\" in the position column.\n\nUpon reviewing all rows from 1 to 41, it seems that Steve Borthwick is listed under Row 31 with position \"fly-half\", not prop. That's conflicting because the claim says he's a prop.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting or misunderstanding the table structure. Let me re-examine the data provided:\n\nLooking back at the user's message, in the table, Steve Borthwick is listed in Row 31 as position \"fly-half\" from Newcastle. That contradicts the claim that he's a prop for Leicester.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error earlier. Let me go through each row where position is \"prop\":\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\nRow 0: Position not specified? Wait no, the table seems to have columns like player name, position, club, etc. So maybe in Row 31, Jonny Wilkinson is a fly-half from Newcastle.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting because the user only provided up to Row 41 but didn't list all rows as \"prop\". Let me check each row for players with position \"prop\".\n\nUpon reviewing, it seems that Steve Borthwick isn't listed as a prop in the table. Instead, in Row 30: Charlie Hodgson is fly-half from Sale.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confused because the data provided doesn't have Steve Borthwick as a prop. The claim says he's Leicester's best-known prop, but according to the table, he's a fly-half from Newcastle (Row 31). So that contradicts the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Steve Borthwick isn't listed as a prop for Leicester in the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Steve Borthwick is Leicester's best-known player as a prop. Checking the table, Steve Borthwick is listed as a fly-half from Newcastle (Row 31), not as a prop for Leicester. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"club\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
