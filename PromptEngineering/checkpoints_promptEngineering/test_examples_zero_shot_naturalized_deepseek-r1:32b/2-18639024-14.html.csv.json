    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the data provided. The claim says: \"4 of the Melbourne Victory record players be active for a total of 2 years.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim means. It mentions four players from Melbourne Victory who have been active for a total of two years. So, I'm looking for four individuals whose time being active (probably their career span) adds up to exactly two years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with details about the number of games they've played and the years they were active. The \"years\" column shows the period each player was active, like \"2010 - present\" or just a single year.\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to find four players whose active periods add up to two years in total. That could mean each of them has been active for half a year, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe they were active for different spans that together sum to two years. However, since the table shows full years, it's more plausible that each player was active for one year, making four players contribute four years in total, which contradicts the claim of two years.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe \"active\" refers to being on the team during a specific time frame, not their entire career. But the table shows the years they were with Melbourne Victory. So, if four players were each active for half a year, that would make two years in total. However, the table doesn't provide information about partial seasons or months; it only mentions full years.\n\nLooking through the data, most players have either one season or multiple. For example, Marlies Oostdam has been with Melbourne Victory from 2008 to present, which is more than two years. Similarly, Jodie Taylor was active from 2010 to present, which also exceeds two years.\n\nI don't see any player who was only active for a fraction of a year or just one season. Most have been there for multiple seasons, and some are still active. Therefore, adding up four players' active periods would likely result in more than two years, not exactly two.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim refers to their total combined time across all teams being two years, but the table only shows their time with Melbourne Victory. So unless each of these four players was only active for six months with Melbourne, which isn't indicated, it doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a misstatement and they meant that the team has four active players in total over two seasons. But again, looking at the data, many players have been there longer than two years.\n\nSo, considering all this, I don't find evidence supporting the claim that four Melbourne Victory record players were active for a total of two years. The data shows their active periods are typically one year or more, and adding up four such players would exceed two years.\n</think>\n\nThe claim suggests four players with a combined active period of exactly two years. However, the table indicates each player's tenure is at least one full season (a year), so four players would account for four or more years. Thus, the claim isn't supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out whether the claim \"Rebecca Tegg is not active in 2009, 2010, or 2011\" is true or false based on the provided table data. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should locate Rebecca Tegg in the table. Looking through the rows, I see that row 33 has her name: \"Rebecca Tegg\". Now, let's check which columns are relevant to determine her activity during those years. The claim is about her not being active in specific years, so I need to look at when she was active.\n\nThe table has a column named \"years\" which shows the time period she was active. For Rebecca Tegg, the years listed are \"2008\". That means she was active in 2008 but there's no information about her activity beyond that year in this data. \n\nWait a minute, the claim states that she wasn't active in 2009, 2010, or 2011. But the table only shows up to 2008 for her. Does this mean she wasn't active after that? Or could it be possible that the data doesn't go beyond 2008, so we don't know about her activity in later years?\n\nHowever, based solely on the information provided, since her last year of activity listed is 2008, there's no evidence to support that she was active in 2009, 2010, or 2011. Therefore, the claim can be considered true because the data doesn't show any activity beyond 2008 for Rebecca Tegg.\n\nI should also check if there are other columns that might indicate her activity in those years, but looking at the table structure, the relevant column is \"years\". There's no other column like \"status\" or \"active until\", so I can rely on the \"years\" column for this verification.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states Rebecca Tegg was inactive from 2009 to 2011. The table shows her active only in 2008, supporting the claim.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Locate Rebecca Tegg**: Found at row index 33.\n2. **Check Activity Years**: \"years\" column shows 2008.\n3. **Compare with Claim**: Since she was active only in 2008, the claim that she wasn't active in 2009-2011 holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"years\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "laura alleway , megan archer , and ashley brown be 3 of the player to not receive any goal",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to verify the claim that Laura Alleway, Megan Archer, and Ashley Brown are three of the players who have not received any goals. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each player mentioned in the claim: Laura Alleway, Megan Archer, and Ashley Brown. The claim is about whether these three haven't received any goals, which means their 'goals' column should be zero.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to find the rows corresponding to each of these players and check their 'goals' value. \n\nStarting with Laura Alleway: Scanning through the rows, I see her name listed in row 27 under 'vendrana popovic'\u2014wait, no, that's not correct. Let me double-check. Oh, perhaps I made a mistake there. Wait, looking again at the data provided:\n\nLooking at each row index:\n- Row 0: Laura Alleway\n- Row 1: Megan Archer\n- Row 2: Ashley Brown\n\nWait, in the table given by the user, rows are from 0 to 36, but only up to row 36. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, the table provided starts with Laura Alleway at row 0, then Megan Archer at row 1, and Ashley Brown at row 2. Then each subsequent player is listed down.\n\nSo for each of these three players:\n\n- Laura Alleway (row 0): her goals are in column 'goals'. Let me check the data: under row 0, goals are 5. So she has scored 5 goals.\n- Megan Archer (row 1): Her goals are 4.\n- Ashley Brown (row 2): Her goals are 3.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the claim says they didn't receive any goals. But looking at their 'goals' column shows they have received goals. So if their goal counts are 5, 4, and 3 respectively, then the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table structure. Let me confirm the columns: The table includes columns like 'name', 'games', 'goals', etc. So the 'goals' column represents how many goals each player has scored or received? Usually, in sports stats, 'goals' refer to goals scored by the player, not against them.\n\nWait a second\u2014that's an important point. In soccer statistics, sometimes 'goals against' is tracked for goalkeepers, but for field players, it's typically goals scored. So if these are field players, then their 'goals' column would be how many they've scored, not received (conceded). Therefore, the claim might actually be about whether they haven't conceded any goals, which would relate to a different metric, perhaps 'goals against' or something similar.\n\nLooking back at the table provided by the user, I don't see a 'goals against' column. The columns mentioned are: name, games, goals, etc. So unless there's another column that tracks goals conceded, it's possible that the claim is misaligned with the data presented.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table doesn't track goals conceded for these players, making it impossible to verify the claim. But given the structure, I think 'goals' refers to scored, not conceded.\n\nSo if Laura Alleway has 5 goals, Megan Archer has 4, and Ashley Brown has 3 in their respective rows under the 'goals' column, then they have indeed received (scored) goals. Therefore, the claim that they are three players who did not receive any goals is incorrect because each of them has a non-zero number of goals.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting the term 'receive any goal.' If it means they haven't conceded goals, which is typically tracked for goalkeepers, then perhaps this data isn't available in the table. However, since the table doesn't have a column indicating goals conceded or saved, we can't verify that aspect.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim refers to not scoring any goals (i.e., having zero in the 'goals' column), then let's check each of their 'goals':\n\n- Laura Alleway: 5 \u2192 Not zero.\n- Megan Archer: 4 \u2192 Not zero.\n- Ashley Brown: 3 \u2192 Not zero.\n\nTherefore, all three have scored goals, so they have received (as in, been credited with) goals. Hence, the claim that they are players who did not receive any goals is false because their 'goals' column shows they have received (scored) some goals.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The claim says \"to not receive any goal.\" If 'receive any goal' means they haven't been on the receiving end of a goal scored against them, that would pertain to defensive stats or maybe goalkeeper saves. However, in the absence of such data in the table, we can only go by what's provided.\n\nGiven that, since the claim is about not receiving any goals and the table doesn't track conceded goals for these players, it might be impossible to confirm. But if 'receive any goal' is taken as having zero goals scored (which seems counterintuitive), then their non-zero goals would make the claim false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the data, but based on what's provided, I have to work with that.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The claim states that Laura Alleway, Megan Archer, and Ashley Brown are three players who did not receive any goals. Based on the table, each of them has scored goals (5, 4, 3 respectively), so if 'receive' refers to scoring, then they have received goals. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, if 'receive' means concede, and since we don't have that data, perhaps the answer is that it's impossible to verify based on the provided information. But given the context, I think the claim is about not having any goals scored, which isn't accurate because they do have goals.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Laura Alleway, Megan Archer, and Ashley Brown are three players who did not receive any goals. Upon examining their respective rows in the table:\n\n- **Laura Alleway** (row 0) has 5 goals.\n- **Megan Archer** (row 1) has 4 goals.\n- **Ashley Brown** (row 2) has 3 goals.\n\nSince each of them has a non-zero number of goals, they have indeed received goals. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is incorrect because Laura Alleway, Megan Archer, and Ashley Brown have all received goals (as indicated by their respective goal counts in the table). \n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{\\text{False}}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"katrina gorry be active after daniela diggiammarco and rebecca tegg\" is true or false based on the data provided in the table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that Katrina Gorry became active after Daniela Diggiammarco and Rebecca Tegg. So, I think \"active\" here refers to when each player started being part of whatever context we're looking at\u2014maybe joining a team or starting in the league.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different person with various columns: name, games played (with some numbers in parentheses), W-League stats, finals appearances, goals scored, and years active. The key column here is probably the \"years\" under the \"years\" column since it shows when each player was active.\n\nSo, I'll focus on the \"years\" column for each of these three players: Katrina Gorry, Daniela Diggiammarco, and Rebecca Tegg.\n\nLet me locate their rows in the table:\n\n- Katrina Gorry is row 15. Her years are listed as 2009.\n- Daniela Diggiammarco is row 3. Her years are 2008.\n- Rebecca Tegg is row 32. Her years are 2008.\n\nWait, actually looking again:\n\nWait, the rows might not be in order. Let me double-check each name's row index as provided in the data.\n\nLooking through all the rows, I see:\n\n- Daniela Diggiammarco: I think that's row 3 because earlier rows are listed before her. Wait no, actually looking at the data provided, let me count the rows correctly.\n\nWait, the table is given with each player starting from row 0. Let me recount to be accurate.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nRow 0: Katrina Gorry? No, row 0 isn't named yet. Wait, perhaps I miscounted. The first entry after the initial problem statement is row 1: \"katrina gorry be active after daniela diggiammarco and rebecca tegg\". Hmm, no\u2014actually, each player's data is listed as a separate row in the table provided.\n\nWait, let me parse this correctly. Each line starting with \"Row\" indicates a new player. So:\n\nRow 1: Katrina Gorry? No, looking back, I think the initial problem statement includes the table from Row 0 to Row 36.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all players and their years:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: Marlies Oostdam, years: 2008-present\n\nRow 1: Vendrana Popovic, 2009\n\nRow 2: Kara Mowbray, 2009\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm miscounting because the initial data is not in order. Let me go through each row properly.\n\nActually, looking at the data:\n\nThe table starts with:\n\n- Row indices from 1 to 36 (assuming each line after \"Row\" is a new entry).\n\nBut to be precise, let's list out each player and their years active as per the given data.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow 1: Katrina Gorry, years: 2009\n\nRow 2: Daniela Diggiammarco, years: 2008\n\nWait no, I'm getting confused. Let me parse the data correctly.\n\nEach line starts with \"Row x: Name...\" followed by their stats and years. So for each name:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Katrina Gorry (years: 2009)\n- Row 3: Daniela Diggiammarco (years: 2008)\n- Row 32: Rebecca Tegg (years: 2008)\n\nWait, actually, I need to find the correct rows for each name.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nKatrina Gorry is in row 15? Wait no, perhaps not. Let me go step by step.\n\nLet me list all players and their years active:\n\nRow 0: Marlies Oostdam, 2008-present\n\nWait no, actually the initial data starts with the first player as Row 1, since the problem statement includes rows up to row 36.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider each line after \"Row\" as a new entry. For example:\n\n- The first player is in Row 1: Katrina Gorry, years active 2009\n\nSecond player: Daniela Diggiammarco? Wait no, looking at the data, it's more likely that each row corresponds to a different player.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the exact rows where these three names appear.\n\nLooking through the data:\n\n- Katrina Gorry is in Row 15: \"Row 15: Katrina Gorry, years active 2009\"\n\n- Daniela Diggiammarco is in Row 3: \"Row 3: Daniela Diggiammarco, years active 2008\"\n\n- Rebecca Tegg is in Row 32: \"Row 32: Rebecca Tegg, years active 2008\"\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting because the rows are not listed sequentially. Let me recount each line properly.\n\nActually, looking at the data provided:\n\nAfter the problem statement, the user lists a series of rows, each starting with \"Row x:\", but in this case, it's more about identifying the correct years for each player.\n\nUpon checking:\n\nKatrina Gorry: Her row shows years as 2009.\n\nDaniela Diggiammarco: Her row shows years as 2008.\n\nRebecca Tegg: Her row also shows years as 2008.\n\nSo, Daniela and Rebecca started in 2008, while Katrina started in 2009. Therefore, Katrina's active years began after both Daniela and Rebecca.\n\nThus, the claim is true because Katrina Gorry became active in 2009, which is after Daniela Diggiammarco (2008) and Rebecca Tegg (2008).\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Katrina Gorry became active after Daniela Diggiammarco and Rebecca Tegg is **true**.

The claim is that \"4 of the Melbourne Victory record players be active for a total of 8 years.\" I need to verify if this is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table to check how many years each player has been active with Melbourne Victory. The relevant column here is \"years,\" which shows the duration each player has been active.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Years are from 2010-2023, that's 14 years.\n2. **Row 1**: 2010-2023 \u2192 14 years.\n3. **Row 2**: 2010-2023 \u2192 14 years.\n...\nContinuing this way, I notice that most players have been active for around 14 years.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"rebecca tegg be not active in 2003 , or 2011\" is true based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to locate Rebecca Tegg in the table. Looking at each row:\n\n- Row 33: name is \"rebecca tegg\". Okay, so that's her row.\n\nNow, I'm looking for information about when she was active. The columns available are \"name\", \"games\", \"w - league\", \"finals\", and \"years\".\n\nThe key column here seems to be the \"years\" column because it likely indicates the years she was active in the league. Let's check what her \"years\" field says.\n\nLooking at row 33, under \"years\": \"2008\". Hmm, that suggests she was active starting from 2008. But the claim mentions 2003 and 2011.\n\nWait, does this mean she wasn't active in 2003? Yes, because her activity starts in 2008. So for 2003, it's correct that she wasn't active then.\n\nNow, what about 2011? Her \"years\" field is listed as \"2008 - present\". The term \"present\" implies up until now, which would include 2011 since it's between 2008 and the current year. So she was active in 2011.\n\nBut the claim says she was not active in 2003 OR 2011. Since she wasn't active in 2003 but was active in 2011, the \"OR\" condition is partially true and partially false. However, for the entire claim to be supported, both parts need to be accurate if it's a conjunction. Wait, no\u2014the wording is \"not active in 2003 , or 2011\". The use of \"or\" here can be a bit tricky.\n\nIf the claim is stating that she wasn't active in either 2003 or 2011, but actually, she was active in 2011, then the claim isn't fully true because part of it (the 2011 part) isn't correct. Alternatively, if \"or\" is used to mean that at least one of those years she wasn't active, which is the case with 2003, but since she was active in 2011, does that make the entire claim true?\n\nWait, let's clarify the logic here. The claim says she isn't active in either 2003 or 2011. So both conditions need to be true for the claim to hold if it's using \"or\" as a logical OR. But since she was active in 2011, that part is false. Therefore, the overall claim would be false because not all parts of the OR condition are met\u2014only one part (2003) holds, but the other doesn't.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim is interpreted as \"she was inactive in both 2003 and 2011,\" which would require her to not have been active in either year. But since she was active in 2011, that makes the claim false.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine how the years are presented. The \"years\" column for Rebecca Tegg says \"2008\", but does that mean only 2008? Or is it a range up to present?\n\nLooking at other entries, some have ranges like \"2008 - present\". For example, row 36 has \"years\": \"2010 - present\". So perhaps Rebecca's entry is just listed as \"2008\" but in reality, it might be a typo or shorthand for \"2008 - present\".\n\nIf that's the case, then she was active from 2008 onwards. Therefore:\n\n- Inactive in 2003: True\n- Active in 2011: True\n\nSo if the claim is that she wasn't active in either 2003 OR 2011, but she was actually active in 2011, then the claim isn't fully supported because one part (the 2011 part) is false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the \"years\" column. Maybe \"years\" indicates all the years she's been active, so if it says \"2008\", that might mean only 2008. But looking at other entries, like row 36: \"years\": \"2010 - present\", which suggests a range. So Rebecca Tegg's \"years\" being just \"2008\" could be incomplete or perhaps a single year.\n\nWait, let me check the structure of the table again to see if it consistently uses ranges for multiple years. For example:\n\n- Row 36: \"years\": \"2010 - present\"\n- Row 35: \"years\": \"2010 - present\"\n- Row 34: \"years\": \"2010 - present\"\n\nSo Rebecca's entry is just \"2008\". That could mean she was active only in 2008, or it might be a typo and should say \"2008 - present\" as well.\n\nIf we assume that her activity started in 2008 and continued up to the current year (including 2011), then she wasn't active in 2003 but was active in 2011. Therefore, the claim that she isn't active in either 2003 or 2011 is false because she was active in 2011.\n\nBut if her activity was only in 2008 and perhaps hasn't continued beyond that (which seems less likely given other entries), then she wasn't active in 2011 either. But looking at the data, it's more consistent for \"years\" to indicate a range when there are multiple years.\n\nSo considering that, Rebecca Tegg was active from 2008 onwards. Therefore:\n\n- Inactive in 2003: True\n- Active in 2011: True\n\nThus, the claim that she isn't active in either year is false because she was active in 2011.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The claim says \"not active in 2003 , or 2011\". If we interpret it as \"she wasn't active in 2003 and also wasn't active in 2011\", then both conditions must be true for the claim to hold. However, if she was active in 2011, that makes the claim false.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim is saying \"either she wasn't active in 2003 OR she wasn't active in 2011\", which would mean at least one of those is true. Since she wasn't active in 2003, this part is true, making the entire claim true.\n\nWait, but logically, if the claim is \"A or B\" where A is \"not active in 2003\" and B is \"not active in 2011\", then as long as at least one of these is true, the claim holds. Since she wasn't active in 2003 (A is true), the entire OR condition is satisfied, making the claim true.\n\nBut earlier analysis suggested that if her \"years\" are \"2008 - present\", then B (\"not active in 2011\") would be false because she was active there. So if A is true and B is false, the OR statement (A or B) is still true because only one needs to be true.\n\nWait, that changes things. So even though she was active in 2011, making B (\"not active in 2011\") false, since A (\"not active in 2003\") is true, the entire claim holds.\n\nBut now I'm confused because earlier I thought the claim required both to be true, but with OR logic, only one needs to be. So perhaps the claim is correct because she wasn't active in 2003, even if she was active in 2011.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is trying to say that she's not active in either of those years, implying both. But grammatically, it's \"or\", which typically means one or the other, but not necessarily both. So perhaps the correct interpretation is that at least one of the statements is true. In this case, since she wasn't active in 2003, the claim holds.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me break it down:\n\n- Claim: Rebecca Tegg was not active in 2003 OR she was not active in 2011.\n- For an OR statement to be true, at least one of the conditions needs to be true.\n\nSince she wasn't active in 2003 (A is true), the entire statement is true regardless of her activity in 2011. Therefore, the claim holds.\n\nHowever, if the claim had used \"and\" instead of \"or\", then both conditions would need to be true for the statement to hold, which wouldn't be the case here because she was active in 2011.\n\nBut based on the given table and assuming that Rebecca's activity started in 2008 and continued up to at least 2011 (as per other entries), then:\n\n- She wasn't active in 2003: True\n- She wasn't active in 2011: False\n\nSo, since A is true, the OR condition holds, making the claim correct.\n\nWait a second. But perhaps I'm misinterpreting the \"or\". Maybe the intended meaning was that she's not active in either year, implying both. That would be an AND situation, but it was written as \"or\".\n\nIn logic, \"A or B\" means A is true, B is true, or both are true. It doesn't require both to be true unless specified with AND.\n\nTherefore, if the claim is that she wasn't active in 2003 OR not active in 2011, and we know she wasn't active in 2003, then regardless of her activity in 2011, the claim is satisfied.\n\nThus, based on this logical interpretation, the claim holds because at least one condition (not being active in 2003) is met.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes \"or\" can be ambiguous. However, in formal logic and programming contexts, OR means that only one needs to be true for the statement to hold.\n\nTherefore, considering all this, the claim that Rebecca Tegg wasn't active in 2003 or 2011 is correct because she wasn't active in 2003.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Rebecca Tegg was not active in either 2003 or 2011. Based on the analysis, her activity started in 2008 and continued up to at least 2011. Therefore, she wasn't active in 2003 but was active in 2011.\n\nSince the claim uses \"or,\" it means that if at least one of the conditions (not being active in 2003 or not being active in 2011) is true, the entire statement holds. In this case, she wasn't active in 2003, making the claim correct.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is correct because Rebecca Tegg was not active in 2003.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim states that \"Enza Barilla and Snez Veljanovska be 2 of the athlete that be no longer active.\" So I need to check if both Enza Barilla and Snez Veljanovska are no longer active athletes based on the data provided in the table.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, I notice that it lists a bunch of athletes with various details like games, w-leagues, finals, goals, and years. The years column seems important here because it can indicate if they're still active or not. If an athlete's last year is before the current year (which I assume is 2023), then maybe they are no longer active.\n\nLooking through the table for Enza Barilla... Hmm, I don't see any row with that name. The names listed include Enza Barilla? Let me check again. Wait, looking at rows 1 to 36, I don't see a row where the name is Enza Barilla. So, maybe she isn't in this table. That could mean her status isn't available here, or perhaps she's not part of this dataset.\n\nNow checking for Snez Veljanovska. Scanning through the rows, I find that at row 35, there's a name \"snez veljanovska.\" Let me look at her details: games (8), w-leagues (4), finals (1), goals (0), and years listed as 2010 - present. Wait, so her years are from 2010 to now. So she's still active because the end year is 'present.' That means she hasn't retired yet.\n\nSince Enza Barilla isn't in the table at all, I can't confirm her status based on this data. But since Snez Veljanovska is listed as active (years up to present), the claim that both are no longer active is incorrect because at least one of them (Snez) is still active.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the table because Enza Barilla isn't even in the dataset and Snez Veljanovska is still active. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions two athletes, Enza Barilla and Snez Veljanovska, as no longer active. Checking the table:\n\n- Enza Barilla: Not found in the provided data.\n- Snez Veljanovska (row 35): Years listed as \"2010 - present,\" indicating she is still active.\n\nSince both conditions aren't met, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"years\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
