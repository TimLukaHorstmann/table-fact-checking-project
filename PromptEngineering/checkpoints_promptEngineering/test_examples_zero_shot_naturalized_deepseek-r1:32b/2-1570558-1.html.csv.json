Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It says two things:\n1. In 2006, Sherdrick had 16 interceptions (int).\n2. In 2005, Sherdrick had 10 interceptions.\n\nI'll check each part against the table to see if both are accurate.\n\nLooking at the table rows for 2005 and 2006:\n\nFor 2005:\n- The row index is 14. Let me confirm: Row 14 has year 2005.\n- The 'int' column for 2005 shows 10. So that's correct.\n\nFor 2006:\n- The row index is 15. Wait, no\u2014checking the rows again, Row 13 is 2006? Let me recount:\nRow 1:1993, 2:1994,... up to Row 8:2001, then Row9:2002, Row10:2003, Row11:2004, Row12:2005, Row13:2006. So yes, Row13 is 2006.\n- The 'int' column for 2006 shows 16. Correct.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are accurate according to the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nI need to list the relevant cells that support this conclusion. For each year mentioned in the claim:\n\n- For 2005 (Row12), 'int' is 10.\n- For 2006 (Row13), 'int' is 16.\n\nSo the relevant cells are Row12, column 'int' and Row13, column 'int'.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Sherdrick had 16 interceptions in 2006 and 10 in 2005. The table confirms both numbers for those years.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n1. **Identify Rows:** Locate rows for the years 2005 and 2006.\n   - Row12 corresponds to 2005, and Row13 to 2006.\n2. **Check Interceptions (int):** \n   - For 2005: int = 10 (Row12).\n   - For 2006: int = 16 (Row13).\n3. **Verify Claim:** Both values match the claim, so it's TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"int 's\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"int 's\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I'll check each row to find these years.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n- Row 11 has the year 2004.\n- Row 14 has the year 2007.\n\nNext, I need to find the completions (comp) for each of these years.\n\nFor 2004:\n- The 'comp' value is 348. So, Sherdrick completed 348 passes in 2004.\n\nFor 2007:\n- The 'comp' value is 315.

The goal is to determine if the claim \"in 2004 Sherdrick have a completion percentage that be 3.1% higher than his career total\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what needs verification. The claim states two main points:\n1. In the year 2004, Sherdrick's completion percentage was 3.1% higher than his career total.\n2. I need to check if this is accurate using the data from the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year along with various statistics for that year. The last row (row 16) seems to be the career totals, which includes cumulative stats across all years. \n\nTo verify the claim, I'll need two specific pieces of information:\n- Sherdrick's completion percentage in 2004.\n- His overall career completion percentage.\n\nStarting with the 2004 statistics: Scanning through the rows, row 11 corresponds to the year 2004. In this row, the 'comp%' is listed as 64.9%. This is Sherdrick's completion percentage for that specific year.\n\nNext, I need to find his career total completion percentage. The last row (row 16) provides the career statistics, where the 'comp%' is 61.8%. \n\nNow, comparing these two values:\n- 2004 comp%: 64.9%\n- Career comp%: 61.8%\n\nTo check if 64.9% is 3.1% higher than 61.8%, I'll subtract the career percentage from the 2004 percentage:\n64.9 - 61.8 = 3.1\n\nThis calculation shows that Sherdrick's 2004 completion percentage was indeed exactly 3.1% higher than his career total.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_ cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"comp%\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"comp%\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Looking at the table provided:\n\n- Row 6 corresponds to 1998: comp=295, att=451, yards=3571.\n- Row 7 is for 2000: comp=269, att=473, yards=3454.\n\nThe claim states that in 1998, Sherdrick Bonner had 116 more yards than in 2000. To verify this, I subtract the yards from 2000 (3454) from those in 1998 (3571):\n\n3571 - 3454 = 117.\n\nHmm, that gives a difference of 117 yards, not 116 as claimed. The claim is off by one yard.

It seems to list statistics for a player (likely Sherdrick Bonner) over several years and includes columns like year, completions (comp), attempts (att), completion percentage (comp%), yards, touchdowns (td's), interceptions (int's), and rating.\n\nThe claim is about whether 2007 was the season where Sherdrick Bonner achieved his highest rating. So, I should look for the \"rating\" column in each row to find out which year had the highest value.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Year 1993, Rating 57.0\n- Row 2: Year 1994, Rating 98.5\n- Row 3: Year 1995, Rating 95.3\n- Row 4: Year 1996, Rating 110.4\n- Row 5: Year 1997, Rating 120.3\n- Row 6: Year 1998, Rating 121.0\n- Row 7: Year 2000, Rating 111.7\n- Row 8: Year 2001, Rating 120.2\n- Row 9: Year 2002, Rating 115.5\n- Row 10: Year 2003, Rating 126.5\n- Row 11: Year 2004, Rating 115.0\n- Row 12: Year 2005, Rating 108.2\n- Row 13: Year 2006, Rating 109.8\n- Row 14: Year 2007, Rating 117.2\n- Row 15: Year 2008, Rating 116.3\n- Row 16: Career stats, Rating 115.9\n\nLooking at the ratings across all years, the highest value is in row 10 for 2003 with a rating of 126.5. The 2007 season (row 14) has a rating of 117.2, which isn't higher than this.\n\nTherefore, Sherdrick Bonner's best rating was actually in the 2003 season, not 2007.

The claim states: \"2006 be the season in which Sherdrick have 14 int and he have 10 int in 2005.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. In 2006, Sherdrick had 14 interceptions (int).\n2. In 2005, Sherdrick had 10 interceptions.\n\nI'll check each part against the table data.\n\nLooking at Row 15 for 2008: It shows 3 int's. But that's not relevant here.\n\nFor 2006: I look for the row where year is 2006. Scanning through, I find Row 13 which has year: 2006. The 'int  's' column (interceptions) shows 16. So in 2006, he had 16 interceptions, not 14 as claimed.\n\nFor 2005: Checking the row with year 2005 is Row 12. The 'int  's' there is 10. So that part matches.\n\nSince the first part of the claim (14 int in 2006) is incorrect, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells from the table that were checked:\n\n- For 2005: Row 12, column 'int  's'.\n- For 2006: Row 13, column 'int  's'.\n\nThese are the cells that support evaluating the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"int  's\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"int  's\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Looking at the table rows, I'll check for these years. \n\nStarting with 2004: Scanning each row, Row 11 is for the year 2004. The completion (comp) value here is 348. So Sherdrick had 348 completions in 2004.\n\nNext, checking 2007: Moving through the rows, I find Row 14 which corresponds to 2007. The comp column for this row shows 315 completions.\n\nNow, the claim says Sherdrick had 37 more completions in 2004 than in 2007. To verify this, I subtract the 2007 completions from the 2004 ones: 348 - 315 equals 33.\n\nWait a minute, that's only 33 more completions, not 37 as claimed. That means the claim isn't accurate because it states there are 37 more, but in reality, there's only 33. \n\nSo, based on these numbers from the table, the difference is less than what the claim suggests. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nI should also note which cells I checked to verify this. For 2004, that's Row 11 and the 'comp' column.
