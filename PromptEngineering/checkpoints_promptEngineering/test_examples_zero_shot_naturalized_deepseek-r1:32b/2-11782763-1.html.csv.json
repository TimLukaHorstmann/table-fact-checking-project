    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine if the claim \"William Adelin be the only one who became heir due to birth\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that William Adelin was the sole individual to become an heir solely because of his birth. So, I'm looking for any entry in the table where someone became an heir specifically \"due to birth.\"\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different heir with details about their status, relationship to the monarch, when they became heir, the reason, and so on.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to check if any other heirs besides William Adelin became heirs due to birth. \n\nStarting with Row 1: Robert Curthose became heir in 1066 because his father became king. The reason is not related to birth but rather the father's ascension, so this doesn't fit.\n\nRow 2 seems to be about an unclear succession period, which isn't relevant here since it's uncertain who was the heir or why.\n\nRow 3 again mentions Robert Curthose becoming heir in 1087 by agreement. The reason is an agreement, not birth.\n\nRow 4: Henry Beauclerc became heir after Robert's rebellion. The reason here is a rebellion, so not due to birth.\n\nRow 5 covers another unclear succession period, which we can skip as it doesn't provide specific reasons.\n\nRow 6 is about William Adelin. Here, the reason he became heir is listed as \"born.\" So this fits the claim\u2014he became heir because of his birth.\n\nRow 7: Empress Matilda became heir because her brother died. The reason is not due to her own birth but rather the death of her sibling.\n\nSo, after reviewing all rows, only William Adelin's entry mentions becoming heir specifically due to being born. No other heirs in the table have \"born\" as their reason for succession.\n\nTherefore, the claim that William Adelin was the only one who became heir due to birth is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"reason\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"henry beauclerc became heir in 1088 , a year after robert curthose\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It says that Henry Beauclerc became heir in 1088, which was a year after Robert Curthose. So I need to check two things: when Henry became heir and whether that happened exactly one year after Robert did.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan each row for mentions of Henry Beauclerc and Robert Curthose.\n\nStarting with Henry Beauclerc. I find him in Row 4:\n- Heir: henry beauclerc\n- Became heir: 1088\n\nSo according to this, Henry became heir in 1088.\n\nNow, checking when Robert Curthose became heir. Looking through the rows:\n\nRow 1 mentions Robert as heir, with \"became heir\" in 1066.\nBut then Row 3 also has Robert again:\n- Heir: robert curthose\n- Became heir: 1087\n\nWait, so Robert became heir twice? That seems odd. Maybe the first time was under William I and the second under William II.\n\nSo the claim is that Henry became heir in 1088, a year after Robert. Let's see when Robert last became heir. The latest entry for Robert is Row 3, where he became heir in 1087. So if Henry became heir in 1088, that would be exactly one year later.\n\nWait, but I should check the relationship between these two events. According to Row 4, Henry's reason for becoming heir was \"robert 's rebellion.\" So Robert's rebellion led to Henry becoming heir. That makes sense as a sequence: Robert becomes heir in 1087 (Row 3), then in 1088, due to his rebellion, he ceases to be heir, and Henry takes over.\n\nSo the timeline is:\n- Robert became heir in 1087.\n- A year later, in 1088, Henry becomes heir.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Henry became heir a year after Robert (in 1088) seems accurate based on the table. \n\nI should also ensure there are no other entries that contradict this. Looking at the other rows:\n\nRow 2 talks about succession being unclear between 1077-1087 under William I, so nothing conflicting here.\n\nRows 5 and beyond don't involve Henry or Robert, so they're irrelevant to this claim.\n\nThus, all relevant cells support the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE.

The claim says: \"henry beauclerc cease to be heir on 2 august 1100 , follow by william adelin 20 year later.\"\n\nFirst, I need to check when Henry Beauclerc ceased being the heir. Looking at Row 4 of the table, under 'ceased to be heir' it's listed as \"2 august 1100.\" So that part checks out.\n\nNext, I need to find out who followed him and whether it was exactly 20 years later. The next heir mentioned in the table after Henry Beauclerc is William Adelin in Row 6. William became heir on 1103. Let me calculate the time between 2 August 1100 and 1103. That's approximately 3 years, not 20 years later.\n\nSo the claim mentions a 20-year gap, but according to the table, it's only about three years.

Row 3 mentions Robert Curthose again as the heir, with status heir presumptive, relationship as elder brother, became heir in 1087 under William II. So that's a second time he was the heir.\n\nBetween these two rows, I can confirm that Robert was indeed the heir twice: once in 1066 and then again in 1087.

It states that Henry Beauclerc was the sole individual who became an heir because of his birth. So, my goal is to check if any other person in the table also became an heir for the same reason\u2014being born\u2014and whether Henry is unique in this regard.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll examine each row's \"heir\" and \"reason\" columns to see who else might have become heir due to birth. \n\nRow 1: Robert Curthose became heir because his father became king. That's not related to birth directly; it's about succession through the father's status.\n\nRow 2: Succession is unclear, so no relevant information here.\n\nRow 3: Robert again becomes heir by agreement, not due to birth.\n\nRow 4: Henry Beauclerc becomes heir because of Robert's rebellion. That's a political reason, not birth.\n\nRow 5: Unclear succession again.\n\nRow 6: William Adelin is the only son and became heir upon his birth in 1103. Here, the reason is explicitly \"born,\" which matches the claim's condition about becoming heir due to birth.\n\nRow 7: Empress Matilda became heir because her brother died. That's not a birth-related reason but rather succession through circumstances after someone else's death.\n\nSo, from this analysis, both Henry Beauclerc and William Adelin were heirs who became so due to their births (Henry via being the younger brother in row 4? Wait, no\u2014looking back at row 4: Henry became heir because of Robert's rebellion. The reason there is not birth but rebellion. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\nRow 6 says William Adelin was the only son and became heir due to being born in 1103. That seems correct.\n\nHenry Beauclerc's row (row 4) indicates that he became heir because of Robert's rebellion, not his birth. So Henry's status wasn't due to birth but rather political events.\n\nTherefore, only William Adelin became heir because of his birth.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table contains. It seems to list various heirs with details about their status, relationships to the monarch, when they became heir, reasons for that, and when they ceased being heir, along with the respective monarchs. Each row represents an entry in this timeline of heirs.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"daughters\" as the relationship to the monarch. So I need to look through each row and check the \"relationship to monarch\" column to see if any entries mention a daughter.\n\nLooking at Row 1: The heir is Robert Curthose, son of William I. Relationship is \"son.\" That's not a daughter.\n\nRow 2 talks about an unclear succession from 1077-1087 under William I. Since the relationship is unclear, it doesn't contribute to our count either way.\n\nRow 3 again has Robert Curthose as heir but now as the elder brother of William II. Still a son, not a daughter.\n\nRow 4 lists Henry Beauclerc, who is the younger brother of William II. Again, a male relative, so no daughter here.\n\nMoving on to Row 5: Succession unclear under Henry I from 1100-1103. No clear relationship mentioned, so it doesn't help us count daughters.\n\nRow 6 introduces William Adelin as the only son of Henry I. Relationship is \"only son,\" which is male, not a daughter.\n\nFinally, Row 7 mentions Empress Matilda as the heir. Her relationship to the monarch (Henry I) is listed as \"only child.\" Since she's the only child and specifically referred to as an empress, it implies she was female. So here we have one instance where the heir has a daughter relationship.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each row:\n\n1. Robert Curthose - son\n2. Succession unclear - no info\n3. Robert Curthose again - elder brother\n4. Henry Beauclerc - younger brother\n5. Succession unclear - no info\n6. William Adelin - only son\n7. Empress Matilda - only child (daughter)\n\nSo, in the entire table, I only find one instance where the heir has a daughter as their relationship to the monarch: Empress Matilda.\n\nThe claim says \"only 3 heirs have daughter as their relationship.\" But from the data, it's just one.

The claim says he became heir in 1094, which isn't mentioned anywhere. Maybe it's a mistake or referring to another event?\n\nNow checking Empress Matilda's timeline. Looking for her in the table:\n\n- Row 7 states she became heir on November 25, 1120, and was proclaimed in 1127.\n\nSo if Robert supposedly became heir in 1094, that would be a year after Matilda? Wait, but Matilda's earliest date is 1120. So 1094 is way before her time. That doesn't make sense because she wasn't even born yet in 1094.\n\nAlso, looking at all rows for \"Empress Matilda,\" the only relevant cells are row 7, which shows she became heir in 1120 and was the only child of Henry I. There's no mention of her being an heir before that.\n\nSo putting it together: The claim states Robert became heir in 1094, a year after Matilda. But according to the table:\n\n- Robert's heir status started in 1066 and again in 1087, not 1094.\n- Empress Matilda only became heir much later in 1120.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because both dates don't align as stated.

The claim states: \"William Adelin cease to be heir on 5 August 1119, followed by Empress Matilda 21 years later.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the relevant rows in the table. From the naturalized format, it seems like Row 6 and Row 7 are about William Adelin and Empress Matilda respectively.\n\nLooking at Row 6: The heir is William Adelin, who became heir in 1103. He ceased to be heir on November 25, 1120. So his cessation date isn't August 5, 1119 as the claim says; it's over a year later.\n\nNext, Row 7: Empress Matilda became heir on November 25, 1120 (proclaimed in 1127). The reason was her brother dying. Her cessation date is December 1, 1135. \n\nNow, checking the claim's timeline: William Adelin ceasing in August 1119 and Empress Matilda taking over 21 years later would mean she started around August 1140. But according to the table, she became heir in 1120, not 1140. So there's a discrepancy in both the cessation date of Adelin and the timing for Matilda.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect on both points: the dates when William Adelin ceased being heir and the subsequent period before Empress Matilda took over.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that William Adelin ceased to be heir on August 5, 1119, which doesn't match the table's November 25, 1120.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if the claim \"robert curthose be the heir 2 time, in 1082 and 1094\" is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at all the rows where Robert Curthose is listed as the heir. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 1: Heir is Robert Curthose from 1066 to 1077 under William I.\n- Row 3: Heir again Robert Curthose starting in 1087, ending in 1088 under William II.\n\nSo according to the table, Robert was heir twice: once in 1066 (ceased in 1077) and again in 1087 (ceased in 1088). The claim mentions years 1082 and 1094. \n\nWait, but in the table, the periods don't include those specific years. For example, in Row 1, he was heir from 1066 to 1077, so 1082 is within that period? No, because 1082 would be after 1077 when he ceased being heir. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the \"became heir\" and \"ceased\" columns.\n\nWait, Row 1 says became heir in 1066 and ceased in 1077. So from 1066 to 1077, he was the heir. The next time he's heir is in Row 3: became heir in 1087, so that would be his second time.\n\nBut the claim says 1082 and 1094. The first period is up to 1077, which doesn't include 1082. So Robert wasn't heir in 1082; that's after he had already ceased being heir under William I. His second time as heir started in 1087, but the claim says 1094. That falls within 1087 to 1088? Wait no, 1094 is after 1088 when he stopped being heir again.\n\nSo the table shows Robert was heir twice: once from 1066-1077 and then again 1087-1088. The claim mentions 1082 and 1094, which don't align with those periods. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because Robert wasn't heir in those specific years.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Robert Curthose was heir twice in 1082 and 1094 is false based on the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"heir\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"ceased to be heir\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"heir\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"ceased to be heir\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
