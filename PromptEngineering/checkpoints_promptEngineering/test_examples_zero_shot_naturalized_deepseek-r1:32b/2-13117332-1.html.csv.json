    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"both times Andrea Petkovic have the outcome of winner, the surface be clay\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems a bit unclear, but it appears to state that whenever Andrea Petkovic was a winner in any match listed, the surface used was clay. So, we're checking if every time she won, the surface was clay.\n\nLooking at the table, there are seven rows of data. Each row represents a different championship event with details like outcome, date, championship name, location, surface type, opponent, and score in the final.\n\nI'll go through each row to see when Andrea Petkovic's outcome was \"winner.\" \n\n- Row 1: Outcome is winner. Surface is clay.\n- Row 4: Outcome is winner. Surface is clay.\n\nSo, Andrea won twice according to this table. Both times, the surface was clay in both instances (Row 1 and Row 4). There are no other rows where her outcome is a win with a different surface type.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true because each time she was the winner, the surface was indeed clay.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_3\", \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify where Andrea Petkovic participated in each of these events: the China Open and the Brisbane International. Looking at the table rows:\n\n- Row 3 mentions \"Brisbane International\" with a date of 8 January 2011.\n- Row 5 mentions \"China Open\" with a date of 9 October 2011.\n\nSo, according to these entries, Andrea Petkovic played in Brisbane International on January 8, 2011, and then later played in the China Open on October 9, 2011. Since January comes before October, she did indeed play at the China Open after playing at the Brisbane International.\n\nTo confirm this, I should check if both events are associated with Andrea Petkovic as either a winner or runner-up. In Row 3, she was the runner-up in Brisbane International, and in Row 5, she was also the runner-up in the China Open. This confirms her participation in both events.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the dates show that she played at Brisbane first and then China later.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Andrea Petkovic played the China Open after the Brisbane International.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"Andrea Petkovic face justine henin before she face simona halep\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It states that Andrea Petkovic faced Justine Henin in a match before facing Simona Halep. So, I need to check if there are two entries where Andrea played against these two opponents and whether the date of her match against Justine comes before the one against Simona.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 2: Runner-up on June 19, 2010, opponent is Justine Henin.\nRow 6: Runner-up on June 15, 2013, opponent is Simona Halep.\n\nWait a minute, Row 6's date is June 15, 2013, which is after Row 2's date of June 19, 2010. So Andrea faced Justine Henin in 2010 and then Simona Halep in 2013. That would mean she faced Justine before Simona, supporting the claim.\n\nHowever, I also need to check all other rows to ensure there are no other instances where Andrea faced either of these opponents earlier or later that might affect the timeline.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n- Row 1: Winner against Ioana Raluca Olaru on July 26, 2009.\n- Row 3: Runner-up against Petra Kvitov\u00e1 on January 8, 2011.\n- Row 4: Winner against Marion Bartoli on May 21, 2011.\n- Row 5: Runner-up against Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska on October 9, 2011.\n- Row 7: Runner-up against Magdal\u00e9na Ryb\u00e1rikov\u00e1 on August 4, 2013.\n\nNo other matches against Justine Henin or Simona Halep are present except in Rows 2 and 6.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should check all the rows where Andrea Petkovic was the winner. Looking through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Outcome is \"winner\". So that's one win.\n- Row 4: Another outcome of \"winner\". That makes two wins so far.\n  \nWait, are there more? Let me scan through the rest to be sure.\n\nRows 2,3,5,6,7 all have \"runner-up\" as the outcome. So only Rows 1 and 4 show Andrea Petkovic as the winner. That gives us two wins total, which matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNow, checking the surfaces for these wins:\n\n- Row 1: Surface is clay.\n- Row 4: Surface is clay as well.\n\nThe claim says both times she won were on hard surfaces. But in reality, both her victories were on clay courts. Therefore, the second condition isn't met. \n\nSo, Andrea did win twice, but not on hard surfaces.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It says that Andrea Petkovic's only match on grass occurred before 2011. So I need to check all entries in the table where the surface was grass and see if any of them happened after 2011.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Surface is clay, date is July 26, 2009 (before 2011)\nRow 2: Surface is grass, date is June 19, 2010 (before 2011)\nRow 3: Surface is hard, date is January 8, 2011\nRow 4: Surface is clay, date is May 21, 2011\nRow 5: Surface is hard, date is October 9, 2011\nRow 6: Surface is clay, date is June 15, 2013 (after 2011)\nRow 7: Surface is hard, date is August 4, 2013\n\nWait, actually, the claim is about Andrea Petkovic's games. Wait a second\u2014wait, I just noticed that in Row 2, the opponent is Justine Henin, and in other rows, it's different opponents. But does the table specify who Andrea Petkovic played against? Hmm.\n\nWait no\u2014the table shows \"opponent in the final,\" but it doesn't say if the player herself is Andrea Petkovic or someone else. Wait, this might be a confusion point. Let me check: the claim is about Andrea Petkovic's games. So I need to confirm whether Andrea was playing in these matches.\n\nWait, looking at Row 2, opponent is Justine Henin, but who is the player? The table lists outcomes like winner or runner-up. Wait, perhaps the main player here is someone else, but actually, since the claim is about Andrea Petkovic's games, I need to know which rows are her matches.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Is Andrea Petkovic the one listed in these rows? Or is she the opponent?\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Opponent is Ioana Raluca Olaru\u2014so perhaps Andrea was playing against her. But the outcome is winner. So if it's a championship, who is the champion and who is the runner-up.\n\nWait, I think I need to clarify whether these rows are from Andrea Petkovic's perspective or someone else's.\n\nBut in Row 2: outcome is runner-up, opponent is Justine Henin. So perhaps Andrea was the runner-up, meaning she played against Justine Henin in that final on grass surface.\n\nSo, assuming all these rows are about Andrea Petkovic's matches because otherwise, how would we know? Or maybe the table is about someone else, but the claim is about Andrea.\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again: The user gave a table with seven rows, each describing a match outcome. Each row has details like date, championship name, surface, opponent in final, and score.\n\nThe claim is about Andrea Petkovic's games. So perhaps these are all her matches. Therefore, I need to check which of her games were on grass surfaces and their dates.\n\nSo let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Outcome: winner; Surface: clay; Date: July 26, 2009\u2014so before 2011. So a grass surface is not here.\n\nRow 2: Outcome: runner-up; Surface: grass; Date: June 19, 2010\u2014before 2011. This would be the only grass game in this table for Andrea, according to Row 2.\n\nWait, but let me check other rows:\n\nRow 3: hard surface, date 2011 (January)\u2014so before 2011? Wait, January 8, 2011 is before 2011. Hmm, no\u2014January 8, 2011 is in 2011, which is not before 2011.\n\nWait, the claim says \"before 2011.\" So any date on or after January 1, 2011 would be in 2011 or later. Therefore, Row 3 is in 2011, so it's not before.\n\nRow 4: clay, May 21, 2011\u2014again, same year as above.\n\nRow 5: hard surface, October 9, 2011\u2014so again, 2011 or later.\n\nRows 6 and 7 are in 2013, which is after 2011.\n\nSo looking at the table, only Row 2 has a grass surface. The date of that match was June 19, 2010, which is before 2011.\n\nNow, does Andrea have any other matches on grass surfaces? According to this table, no. So if all her grass surface games are in the table, then indeed, she only played one game on grass before 2011.\n\nBut wait a second: The claim says \"the only game.\" So according to the table, she has one grass surface game before 2011. Are there any other grass surface games after that?\n\nLooking at Row 6 and 7\u2014no, both are clay and hard surfaces. So based on this data, her only grass surface match was in 2010.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true according to the table provided.\n\nBut wait\u2014I should be careful: The table might not list all of Andrea's matches. Maybe she played other grass surface matches elsewhere that aren't listed here. However, given the information we have, which is only these seven rows, it seems that her only grass match was in 2010.\n\nTherefore, according to this data, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Andrea Petkovic's only game on a grass surface was before 2011. Based on the provided table:\n\n- The only match played on a grass surface is listed in Row 2, which occurred on June 19, 2010.\n- All other matches are either on clay or hard surfaces and took place in 2011 or later.\n\nGiven this data, Andrea Petkovic's sole grass court appearance was before 2011.

It's stating that Andrea Petkovic participated in the China Open tournament before she played at the Brisbane International. So, essentially, the order of events is important here\u2014China Open came first, then Brisbane International.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are multiple rows, each representing a different tournament outcome for Andrea Petkovic. Let me scan through the table to find entries related to China Open and Brisbane International.\n\nRow 5 mentions \"china open\" as the championship with date \"9 october 2011.\" The surface was hard, opponent was Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska, and she was a runner-up with scores 5-7, 6-0, 4-6. So that's one data point.\n\nRow 3 is about the \"brisbane international\" on \"8 january 2011.\" She was also a runner-up there, facing Petra Kvitov\u00e1 on a hard surface, with scores 1-6 and 3-6.\n\nNow, comparing the dates: China Open was on October 9, 2011, and Brisbane International was January 8, 2011.

So the order here would be Brisbane first (January) and then China Open (October). \n\nBut the claim says she played China Open before Brisbane International.

So I need to check two things: first, what surface was that particular tournament played on, and second, were there any other tournaments on grass surfaces listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 1: Surface is clay.\nRow 2: Surface is grass. The championship here is Unicef Open in 's-Hertogenbosch, Netherlands.\nRow 3: Surface is hard.\nRow 4: Surface is clay.\nRow 5: Surface is hard.\nRow 6: Surface is clay. This is the N\u00fcrnberger Versicherungscup in Germany.\nRow 7: Surface is hard.\n\nWait, so row 2 has a grass surface at Unicef Open. The claim says that N\u00fcrnberger was the only grass surface game. But according to row 2, there's another tournament on grass. So the claim would be false because there are two tournaments played on grass surfaces in the table: one in Nuremberg and one in 's-Hertogenbosch.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For row 2 (Unicef Open) where surface is grass.\n- For row 6 (N\u00fcrnberger Versicherungscup) which also has a surface, but it's clay? Wait, no. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, looking back at row 6: outcome runner-up, date 15 June 2013, championship N\u00fcrnberger Versicherungscup in Germany, surface is clay. Opponent was Simona Halep, score 3-6, 3-6.\n\nOh wait, so the claim says that Nurenberger was played on grass, but according to row 6, the surface is clay.

But according to row 6, Nurenberger was played on clay.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"agnieszka radwa\u0144ska be the opponent in the final on 26 july 2009\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table row by row to find any mention of Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska as an opponent and check if it corresponds to July 26, 2009.\n\nStarting with Row 1:\n- Date: 26 July 2009\n- Opponent in the final: Ioana Raluca Olaru\n\nSo, on that date, the opponent was Ioana Raluca Olaru, not Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska. This means that if the claim is about this date, it should be FALSE.\n\nLooking at other rows to make sure there's no other instance where Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska is an opponent on that date:\n- Row 2: Date June 19, 2010, Opponent Justine Henin\n- Row 3: January 8, 2011, Opponent Petra Kvitov\u00e1\n- Row 4: May 21, 2011, Opponent Marion Bartoli\n- Row 5: October 9, 2011, Opponent Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska\n- Row 6: June 15, 2013, Opponent Simona Halep\n- Row 7: August 4, 2013, Opponent Magdal\u00e9na Ryb\u00e1rikov\u00e1\n\nSo the only time Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska is an opponent is in Row 5 on October 9, 2011. The claim refers to July 26, 2009, which doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the opponent on that date was someone else.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska was the opponent in the final on 26 July 2009. Checking Row 1 of the table, the opponent on that date was Ioana Raluca Olaru, not Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_1\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nThe answer is FALSE because on 26 July 2009 (Row 1), the opponent was Ioana Raluca Olaru, not Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
