    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the table has five rows, each with several columns: goal, date, score, result, and competition. The claim in question is \"on september 10 , 2013 , the result be 3 - 2\". I need to check if this statement holds true based on the data provided.\n\nLet me start by identifying which row in the table corresponds to September 10, 2013. Looking through each row's date:\n\n- Row 1: March 24, 2007\n- Row 2: March 3, 2010\n- Row 3: July 9, 2011\n- Row 4: May 22, 2013\n- Row 5: September 10, 2013\n\nOkay, so the relevant row is Row 5. Now, I need to check two things here: the date and the result.\n\nThe claim mentions \"september 10 , 2013\", which matches exactly with Row 5's date. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, the claim says the result was \"3 - 2\". Looking at Row 5, I see that under the 'result' column, it indeed shows \"3  -  2\". This directly supports the claim about the result being 3-2 on that date.\n\nI should also make sure there are no other rows with the same date. Scanning through again, each row has a unique date, so Row 5 is the only one from September 10, 2013. That means I don't have to worry about conflicting information elsewhere in the table.\n\nSo both the date and the result match what's stated in the claim. Therefore, the claim seems to be fully supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because on September 10, 2013, the result was indeed 3-2 as per Row 5 of the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "goal for friendly competition be less than 3",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim \"goal for friendly competition be less than 3\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is about goals in friendly competitions being less than 3. So, I'm looking for rows where the competition type is 'friendly' and then checking if the goal count is less than 3 in those cases.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Competition is friendly, goal is 1.\nRow 2: Competition is friendly, goal is 2.\nRow 4: Competition is friendly, goal is 4.\n\nSo, rows 1, 2, and 4 are friendly competitions. Now, checking their goals:\n\n- Row 1 has a goal of 1, which is less than 3.\n- Row 2 has a goal of 2, also less than 3.\n- Row 4 has a goal of 4, which is not less than 3.\n\nSince one of the friendly competition rows (Row 4) has a goal count that's more than or equal to 3, the claim isn't fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are the ones where the competition is 'friendly' and their corresponding goals. So, I'll list Row indices 0, 1, and 3 with column names 'goal' and 'competition'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the result of a goal larger than 4 be 3 - 1\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that when the number of goals (goal column) is greater than 4, the result should be \"3 - 1\". So I need to check each row in the table where the goal count is more than 4 and see if their results are indeed \"3 - 1\".\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 1: goal=1. That's less than 5, so it doesn't apply.\nRow 2: goal=2. Also less than 5.\nRow 3: goal=3. Still below 5.\nRow 4: goal=4. Hmm, exactly 4. The claim is about goals larger than 4, so this isn't applicable either.\nRow 5: goal=5. This meets the condition of being greater than 4.\n\nNow, checking row 5's result. It says \"3 - 2\". Wait, that's not \"3 - 1\" as the claim suggests. So in the only row where goals are larger than 4, the result doesn't match what the claim is saying. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data.\n\nI should also make sure I didn't miss any other rows with goal counts over 4. Scanning through again, nope, just row 5. And that one's result doesn't fit. So the claim must be FALSE.\n\nAs for the relevant cells, they are in row 5, specifically the 'goal' and 'result' columns because those are what determine whether the condition holds.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
