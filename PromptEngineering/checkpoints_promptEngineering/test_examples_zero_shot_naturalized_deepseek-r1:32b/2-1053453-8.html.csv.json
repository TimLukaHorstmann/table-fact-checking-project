So, there are two main points here. \n\nThe first part is about Fabi\u00e1n Esp\u00edndola. The claim says he played from 2007 to 2012 and is from Argentina. Looking at the table, I see row 9 has player Fabi\u00e1n Esp\u00edndola. His years are listed as 2007 - 2012, which matches the claim. His nation is 'arg', which stands for Argentina. So that part checks out.\n\nThe second part mentions Javier Morale with years 2007 - present and also from Argentina. Checking row 6, the player is Javier Morales (I assume it's a typo in the claim, but the name should be correct). His years are indeed 2007 - present, so that matches. His nation is 'arg' as well, so he's from Argentina too.\n\nSo both players mentioned in the claim have the correct nations and years according to the table. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly identifies both Fabi\u00e1n Esp\u00edndola and Javier Morales as Argentine (arg) with their respective years matching the table data.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Players in Claim:**\n   - Fabi\u00e1n Esp\u00edndola and Javier Morale (likely a typo for Morales).\n\n2. **Check Nationality of Each Player:**\n   - Fabi\u00e1n Esp\u00edndola is listed as 'arg' (Argentina) in row 9.\n   - Javier Morales is also listed as 'arg' (Argentina) in row 6.\n\n3. **Verify Years Played:**\n   - Fabi\u00e1n Esp\u00edndola's years are 2007-2012, matching the claim.\n   - Javier Morales's years are 2007-present, which aligns with the claim.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   Both players' nationalities and years of play as stated in the claim are accurate according to the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"years\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states he has 21 goals. Looking at the table, Row 3 shows Kyle Beckerman with a rank of 3, nation USA, caps 177, goals 21, and years from 2007 to present. So that checks out\u201421 goals.\n\nThe second part is about Nat Borchers. The claim says he has only 9 goals. Checking Row 5 in the table, Nat Borchers indeed has 9 goals listed. That also matches the claim.\n\nSince both parts of the statement are accurate according to the table, the claim is true.

The claim says: \"player ned grabavoy from the usa have 8 goal while player tony beltran have 0 goal.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what the claim is stating. It mentions two players: Ned Grabavoy and Tony Beltran. For each of them, it specifies their nationality (both are USA) and the number of goals they've scored. The claim says that Ned has 8 goals and Tony has 0.\n\nNow, I'll go through the table to find the relevant information for these two players. \n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- Row 1: Nick Rimando, from the USA, has 201 caps and 0 goals.\n- Row 2: Andy Williams is from Jamaica, which isn't relevant here since both players in the claim are from the USA.\n- Row 3: Kyle Beckerman, also from the USA, with 177 caps and 21 goals. Not needed for this claim.\n- Row 4: Chris Wingert, USA, 174 caps, 1 goal. Again, not relevant here.\n- Row 5: Nat Borchers, USA, 173 caps, 9 goals.\n- Row 6: Javier Morales is from Argentina, so we can skip him for this claim.\n- Row 7: Tony Beltran, USA, 135 caps, and 0 goals. That's one of the players in the claim.\n- Row 8: Ned Grabavoy, USA, 126 caps, 8 goals. This matches the other part of the claim.\n- Rows 9 and 10 aren't needed as they don't mention either player.\n\nSo, according to the table:\n\n- Tony Beltran (Row 7) has indeed 0 goals.\n- Ned Grabavoy (Row 8) has 8 goals.\n\nThe claim matches exactly with the data provided in these two rows. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}",

Looking at Row 3, his years are listed as 2007 - present. That's exactly what the claim states, so that part checks out.\n\nNext is Chris Wingert. He's in Row 4, and according to the table, his years are also 2007 - present. So that matches too.\n\nNow, Javier Morales is mentioned next. I check Row 6 for him. His years are listed as 2007 - present as well. So all three players have the same years as per the claim.\n\nWait a second, I think I made a typo in Javier's last name earlier\u2014it should be Moralez or something else? No, looking back, the table says \"javier morales\" in Row 6, so that's correct.

The claim says he's not from the USA and has more than 21 goals. Let me check the table for his details. Looking at Row 3: rank 3, player is Kyle Beckerman, nation is USA, caps 177, goals 21, years 2007-present. Wait, so according to this, he's from the USA and has exactly 21 goals. The claim states he's not from the USA and has more than 21 goals. Both statements are incorrect based on the table data.\n\nNext, let's look at Nat Borchers. The claim says he isn't from the USA either and only has 4 goals. Checking Row 5: rank 5, player is Nat Borchers, nation is USA, caps 173, goals 9. So he is actually from the USA, contrary to the claim, and he has 9 goals, not 4.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are false.

His nation is USA, which matches the claim. The relevant columns are \"goals\" here.
