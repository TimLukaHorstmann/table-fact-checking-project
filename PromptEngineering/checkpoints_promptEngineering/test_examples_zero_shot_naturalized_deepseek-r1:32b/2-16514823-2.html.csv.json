    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"g\u00f6teborg be match up with ullevi as an opponent on september 19th 2015\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim:\n\n1. **Opponent**: The claim mentions that G\u00f6teborg's opponent was Ullevi.\n2. **Date**: The date given is September 19th, 2015.\n\nNow, I need to check the table for any matches on September 19th, 2015, where G\u00f6teborg faced an opponent named Ullevi.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like date, venue, opponents, etc. The years in all entries are 2005, not 2015. For example:\n\n- Row 19: Date is 2005-08-21\n- Row 22: Date is 2005-09-19\n\nRow 22 has the date September 19th, but the year is 2005, not 2015. The opponent on that date was G\u00f6teborg (as per \"opponents: g\u00f6teborg\"). However, the venue was Ullevi, which might be where the match took place, not who they played against.\n\nWait a second\u2014the claim says \"match up with ullevi as an opponent.\" In Row 22, the opponents are G\u00f6teborg. So actually, G\u00f6teborg is the team playing at Ullevi on that date. The opponent listed is G\u00f6teborg, but I think there might be confusion here because venues and teams can have similar names.\n\nLooking more closely, in Row 22:\n- **Date**: 2005-09-19\n- **Venue**: ullevi\n- **Opponents**: g\u00f6teborg\n\nSo on September 19th, 2005, the match was at Ullevi against G\u00f6teborg. But the claim refers to 2015, which isn't present in any of the table entries.\n\nAdditionally, \"Ullevi\" is a stadium, not typically an opponent's name. Teams play at venues, so it's more likely that Ullevi is where the match was held rather than who they played against. This adds confusion to the claim because Ullevi isn't listed as an opposing team in any of the rows.\n\nSince all dates in the table are from 2005 and none mention 2015, there's no matching data for September 19th, 2015. Moreover, \"Ullevi\" doesn't appear as an opponent anywhere in the table\u2014it\u2019s always a venue.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, the claim cannot be supported because the date and year don\u2019t match any entries, and Ullevi isn\u2019t listed as an opposing team.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Opponents\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
