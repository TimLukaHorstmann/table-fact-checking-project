    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table and the claim. The table has five rows, each representing a different radio station with various attributes like call sign, frequency, city of license, etc. The claim in question is about the frequencies of two specific call signs: w269ax and w273ae.\n\nThe claim states that the frequency for w269ax is 101.7 FM and for w273ae is 102.5 FM. My task is to check these against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a 'call sign' and 'frequency mhz' column. I'll need to find the rows corresponding to call signs w269ax and w273ae.\n\nStarting with w269ax:\n- Row 1: call sign is w230av, not relevant.\n- Row 2: call sign is w269ax. The frequency mhz here is listed as 101.7 fm. This matches the claim exactly.\n\nNext, checking for w273ae:\n- Continuing down the rows after row 2:\n- Row 3: call sign is w273ae. The frequency mhz is 102.5 fm. Again, this aligns perfectly with the claim.\n\nI should make sure that there are no other entries for these call signs in the table to avoid confusion, but since each row has a unique call sign, and only one entry per call sign exists, I don't need to worry about duplicates here.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the rest of the columns isn't necessary because the claim specifically mentions only the frequency mhz for those two call signs. The other attributes like city of license or ERP W aren't part of the claim, so they can be ignored in this context.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are correctly supported by the data in rows 2 and 3 of the table. There's no discrepancy between what's stated in the claim and what's present in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":1,\"column_name\":\"frequency mhz\"}, {\"row_index\":2,\"column_name\":\"frequency mhz\"}]}",

Looking through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: w230av\n- Row 2: w269ax\n- Row 3: w273ae\n- Row 4: w282ae\n- Row 5: w290ag\n\nSo, row 4 has the call sign w282ae.

Call sign w269ax has a frequency of 93.9 FM.\n2. Call sign w273ae has a frequency of 105.9 FM.\n\nI need to check each of these against the table provided.\n\nLooking at Row 2, which is for call sign w269ax: the frequency listed is 101.7 FM. The claim says it's 93.9 FM, so that doesn't match. \n\nNext, checking Row 3 for call sign w273ae: the frequency here is 102.5 FM, not 105.9 as claimed.\n\nWait a second, maybe I should double-check in case I misread something. Let me go through each row again:\n\n- Row 1: w230av \u2192 93.9 FM\n- Row 2: w269ax \u2192 101.7 FM\n- Row 3: w273ae \u2192 102.5 FM\n- Row 4: w282ae \u2192 104.3 FM\n- Row 5: w290ag \u2192 105.9 FM\n\nSo the claim says w269ax is 93.9 FM and w273ae is 105.9 FM. But according to the table, w269ax is on 101.7, and w273ae is on 102.5. The correct call sign for 105.9 FM is w290ag in Row 5.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect.

However, one has its city of license in Anniston, Alabama, while the other is in Macon, Georgia.\n\nWait, actually looking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: Call sign w230av. ERP W is 10, Class D. City of license Gadsden, Alabama.\n- Row 5: Call sign w290ag. ERP W is 27, Class D. City of license Griffin, Georgia.\n\nSo according to the claim, both should have erp W =55 and class D. But in reality:\n\nw230av has ERP W=10 (not 55) but class D is correct.\nw290ag has ERP W=27 (not 55) but class D is correct.\n\nSo the claim that both have erp W of 55 is false because neither do. Also, the cities mentioned in the claim are Anniston and Macon. But looking at the table:\n\nAnniston, Alabama is Row 2 (w269ax), not w230av or w290ag.\nMacon, Georgia is Row 4 (w282ae), again not our two call signs.\n\nSo the claim incorrectly states that one of them is licensed in Anniston and the other in Macon. Instead:\n\n- w230av is in Gadsden, Alabama.\n- w290ag is in Griffin, Georgia.\n\nTherefore, the entire statement doesn't hold true because the ERP values are wrong, and the cities don't match either. The only correct part is that both have class D, but since other parts are incorrect, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells:\n\nFor w230av (Row 1): erp W=10 vs claimed 55, city of license=Gadsden vs Anniston.\nFor w290ag (Row 5): erp W=27 vs claimed 55, city of license=Griffin vs Macon.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 1: call sign (to identify), erp W, class, and city of license.\n- Row 5: same as above.\n\nThus, I'll list all these columns for both rows to show where discrepancies occur.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_1\": 0, \"column_1\": \"call sign\"},\n     {\"row_1\": 0, \"column_2\": \"erp w\"},\n     {\"row_1\": 0, \"column_3\": \"class\"},\n     {\"row_1\": 0, \"column_4\": \"city of license\"},\n     {\"row_5\": 4, \"column_1\": \"call sign\"},\n     {\"row_5\": 4, \"column_2\": \"erp w\"},\n     {\"row_5\": 4, \"column_3\": \"class\"},\n     {\"row_5\": 4, \"column_4\": \"city of license\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nWait, I think the JSON structure needs to have \"row_index\" and \"column_name\". Also, in the table provided, rows are numbered starting from Row 1 as index 0 perhaps? Let me adjust.\n\nCorrecting the indices:\n\nRow 1 is index 0, Row 2 is 1, etc. So for w230av, it's row index 0; for w290ag, row index 4.\n\nSo relevant cells are:\n\n- For w230av (row 0): call sign, erp W, class, city of license.\n- For w290ag (row 4): same columns.\n\nThus, the correct JSON should be:\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"city of license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"city of license\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nBut since the columns are call sign, frequency mhz, city of license, erp w, class, fcc info. So column names as in the table.\n\nSo updating:\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"city of license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"city of license\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nBut perhaps the fcc info isn't relevant. So just these columns.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"city of license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"city of license\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
