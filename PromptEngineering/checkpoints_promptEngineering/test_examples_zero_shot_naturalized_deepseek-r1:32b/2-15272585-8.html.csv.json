    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"galina voskoboeva play a total of 3 game on a hard tennis court\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has five rows, each representing different tournament outcomes for Galina Voskoboeva. Each row includes details like outcome, date, tournament name, surface type, opponent, and score.\n\nThe claim is about her playing a total of 3 games on a hard court. So I need to check how many times she played on a hard surface in the given data.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Surface is \"hard (i)\". That's definitely a hard court.\nRow 2: Surface is also \"hard (i)\", so another hard court match.\nRow 3: The surface here is clay, so that doesn't count.\nRow 4: Surface is hard again. So that's another one.\nRow 5: Surface is clay, so not relevant.\n\nSo that gives us three instances where she played on a hard court: rows 1, 2, and 4.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"play a total of 3 games\". The scores in each row are sets. Each set consists of multiple games. So I need to see if the question is about matches or actual games played. But looking at the claim again, it's about playing on hard courts, so perhaps it's referring to the number of matches (games as in individual contests) she had on hard surfaces.\n\nSo, three matches where the surface was hard: rows 1, 2, and 4. That would make three games (matches) on hard court. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check each row to be sure I'm not making a mistake:\n\nRow 1: Outcome is runner-up, surface hard \u2013 yes.\nRow 2: Winner, surface hard \u2013 yes.\nRow 3: Runner-up, clay \u2013 no.\nRow 4: Runner-up, hard \u2013 yes.\nRow 5: Winner, clay \u2013 no.\n\nThat's three rows with hard surfaces. So the claim that she played a total of 3 games (matches) on hard court is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the surface entries in those three rows.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"Galina Voskoboeva play 20% of her game on a clay top tennis court\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that 20% of her games were played on clay courts. So, I need to check how many games she played in total and then see what percentage of those were on clay surfaces.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game or tournament result. The table has five rows. Each row includes details like outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, and score.\n\nI'll start by counting the total number of games she played. There are 5 rows, so that's 5 games in total.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many of these games were on clay surfaces. The 'surface' column in each row specifies the type of court. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Surface is hard (I). So not clay.\n- Row 2: Surface is hard (I). Again, not clay.\n- Row 3: Surface is clay. This counts towards the clay games.\n- Row 4: Surface is hard. Not clay.\n- Row 5: Surface is clay. Another one.\n\nSo out of five games, two were on clay courts. Now, I need to calculate what percentage that is. \n\nThe formula for percentage is (part / whole) * 100. Here, the part is 2 games, and the whole is 5 games. So:\n\n(2 / 5) * 100 = 40%\n\nWait a minute, but the claim says 20%. That's half of what I calculated. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake?\n\nLet me double-check the surfaces again:\n\nRow 3: clay\nRow 5: clay\n\nThat's two out of five games on clay, which is indeed 40%, not 20%. So the claim that she played 20% of her games on clay courts isn't correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because the actual percentage is higher than claimed.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows Galina Voskoboeva played five games, with two on clay surfaces (40%), not 20%.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"galina voskoboeva have an equal winrate between both clay and hard court\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It suggests that Galina Voskoboeva has the same winning percentage on clay courts as she does on hard courts. So, I'll need to look at her performance on each surface type and calculate her win rates to see if they are equal.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five rows of data. Each row represents a tournament with details about the outcome, date, tournament name, surface, opponent, and score. \n\nI'll go through each row and note the relevant information:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Outcome is runner-up on hard (i) surface.\n2. **Row 2**: Outcome is winner on hard (i) surface.\n3. **Row 3**: Outcome is runner-up on clay surface.\n4. **Row 4**: Outcome is runner-up on hard surface.\n5. **Row 5**: Outcome is winner on clay surface.\n\nNow, let's categorize these by surface and outcome.\n\n**Hard Courts:**\n- Row 1: Runner-up\n- Row 2: Winner\n- Row 4: Runner-up\n\nSo, on hard courts, she has:\n- Wins: 1 (Row 2)\n- Losses: 2 (Rows 1 and 4)\n\nHer win rate on hard courts is 1 win out of 3 matches.\n\n**Clay Courts:**\n- Row 3: Runner-up\n- Row 5: Winner\n\nOn clay, she has:\n- Wins: 1 (Row 5)\n- Losses: 1 (Row 3)\n\nHer win rate on clay is 1 win out of 2 matches.\n\nWait a second. Her win rates are not equal because on hard courts, she has a lower win rate compared to clay. Specifically, on hard court, she won once in three attempts, which is approximately 33%, while on clay, she won once in two attempts, which is 50%. Therefore, her win rates aren't equal.\n\nI should also make sure that there are no other rows or data points that might affect this. The table only has five entries, and I've accounted for all of them regarding hard and clay surfaces. There's one more surface mentioned in Row 1 as \"hard (i)\", but that's still a hard court; the \"(i)\" probably denotes indoor.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because her win rates are not equal on both surfaces.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Galina Voskoboeva has different win rates on clay and hard courts. On hard courts, she won 1 out of 3 matches (approximately 33%), while on clay, she won 1 out of 2 matches (50%).

Let's calculate the percentage: (2/5)*100 = 40%.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim carefully. It says that Galina Voskoboeva didn't play any opponent more than once, except possibly on June 6, 2006. So I need to check each opponent she played against and see if any opponent appears more than once, and whether that exception is valid.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: Opponent Matea Mezak\n- Row 2: Opponent Oleksandra Kravets\n- Row 3: Opponent Roberta Vinci\n- Row 4: Opponent Lilia Osterloh\n- Row 5: Opponent Alice Canepa\n\nEach of these opponents is unique. I don't see any duplicates in the 'opponent' column across all rows. That means she played each opponent only once.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions an exception on June 6, 2006. Let me check which row that date falls into. Row 5 has the date June 6, 2006, and the opponent is Alice Canepa. Since this is the only mention of that date and no other entries have the same opponent on different dates, there's no instance where she played an opponent more than once.\n\nSo, according to the table, Galina Voskoboeva didn't play any opponent more than once at all. The claim allows for a possible exception on June 6, but since that row is only one occurrence, it doesn't affect the truth of the statement.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there are no repeated opponents except where possibly allowed (which in this case isn't even necessary as each opponent appears only once).\n\nThe relevant cells to check are all the 'opponent' entries across all rows.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about Galina Voskoboeva is true or false based on the provided table. The claim states: \"Galina voskoboeva have an equal winrate between both clay and hard court but she never win.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. Let's break it down into two parts:\n\n1. Galina has an equal win rate on both clay and hard courts.\n2. She never wins any matches.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five rows, each representing a different match outcome. Each row includes information about the outcome (whether she won or was runner-up), date, tournament, surface type, opponent, and score.\n\nI need to check how many times she played on clay versus hard courts, whether her win rates were equal on both surfaces, and if she ever won any matches at all.\n\nStarting with the surface types:\n\n- Row 1: Surface is hard (indoor), outcome is runner-up.\n- Row 2: Surface is hard (indoor), outcome is winner.\n- Row 3: Surface is clay, outcome is runner-up.\n- Row 4: Surface is hard, outcome is runner-up.\n- Row 5: Surface is clay, outcome is winner.\n\nNow, let's tally up her wins and losses on each surface:\n\nOn Hard Courts:\n- Wins: Looking at the rows where surface is hard. Rows 1, 2, and 4 are hard courts. \n   - Row 1: Runner-up (loss)\n   - Row 2: Winner (win)\n   - Row 4: Runner-up (loss)\n   So, she has 1 win and 2 losses on hard courts.\n\nOn Clay Courts:\n- Rows 3 and 5 are clay surfaces.\n   - Row 3: Runner-up (loss)\n   - Row 5: Winner (win)\n   So, she also has 1 win and 1 loss on clay courts.\n\nWait, that's not equal in terms of number of matches. On hard courts, she played three times with one win and two losses. On clay, she played twice with one win and one loss. The claim says \"equal winrate,\" which could be interpreted as the same percentage of wins on both surfaces. Let's calculate:\n\nHard court win rate: 1 win / 3 matches \u2248 33.33%\nClay court win rate: 1 win / 2 matches = 50%\n\nThese aren't equal. So her win rates aren't the same.\n\nNext, does she never win? Looking at the outcomes:\n\n- Row 2 and Row 5 are wins. She did win two matches. Therefore, the second part of the claim is false because she has won matches.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The claim says she \"never win.\" If she's a runner-up in some matches but also has wins, then she does win sometimes, so the second part isn't accurate.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are incorrect. She doesn't have an equal win rate on clay and hard courts (33% vs 50%), and she did win some matches.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because her win rates aren't equal, and she has wins in two tournaments.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"on average, Galina Voskoboeva lose with only 4 points against Oleksandra Kravets and Alice Canepa.\" So, it's talking about two specific opponents\u2014Kravets and Canepa\u2014and claiming that on average, Voskoboeva lost to them by a score difference of 4 points.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll check each row for matches against these two players. \n\nRow 2 mentions Oleksandra Kravets as the opponent with an outcome of \"winner.\" The score here is 6-4, 6-2. Wait, that means Voskoboeva won both sets, so she didn't lose. So this row doesn't support the claim.\n\nNext, Row 5 lists Alice Canepa as the opponent, and the outcome is \"winner\" again with a score of 6-1, 6-2. Again, Voskoboeva won both sets here too. \n\nSo in both cases, Voskoboeva was the winner against these opponents. The claim says she lost to them on average by 4 points, but according to the table, she actually won both matches.\n\nMoreover, there's no mention of a loss with a score difference of exactly 4 points in any of these rows.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"on average, galina voskoboeva lose with only 4 point\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It suggests that when Galina Voskoboeva loses a match, she does so on average with just 4 points. So, for each loss, I should look at how many points she scored and then calculate the average of those points across all losses.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five rows, each representing a different tournament outcome. The outcomes are either \"winner\" or \"runner-up.\" Since the claim is about her losing (i.e., being runner-up), I'll focus on the rows where the outcome is \"runner-up.\"\n\nFrom the table:\n- Row 1: Outcome - Runner-up\n- Row 3: Outcome - Runner-up\n- Row 4: Outcome - Runner-up\n\nSo, there are three instances where she lost. For each of these losses, I need to check her scores.\n\nRow 1's score is 6-4, 4-6, 4-6. This seems like a three-set match where she won the first set 6-4 but lost the next two sets 4-6 and 4-6. However, in tennis scoring, each game within a set contributes to points, not overall points per match. The claim mentions \"points,\" so I might be misunderstanding whether it refers to games or actual points.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is between games and points. In tennis, sets are made up of games, which themselves consist of points. But the table lists scores in terms of games won in each set, not individual points. Therefore, interpreting \"points\" as games might be necessary here because the data doesn't show actual points.\n\nAssuming that \"points\" refers to games, let's calculate her average games per loss.\n\nRow 1: She lost two sets with scores 4-6 and 4-6. So in each set she lost, she scored 4 games.\nBut wait, the first set was a win (6-4), so for the total match, how does that factor? The claim is about when she loses, so perhaps we should consider only the sets where she lost.\n\nIn Row 1:\nSet 1: Win - 6 games\nSet 2: Loss - 4 games\nSet 3: Loss - 4 games\n\nBut since the overall outcome is loss (runner-up), maybe we need to consider all her games in that match. So, total games she scored would be 6 + 4 + 4 = 14 games.\n\nHowever, the claim says \"lose with only 4 point,\" which seems low if considering each set's contribution. Alternatively, perhaps it refers to points per game or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is referring to the number of games she lost in a match. In Row 1, she lost two sets where she scored 4 games each. So total games lost would be 4 + 6 (from set 2) and 4 + 6 (from set 3). Wait, that doesn't make sense because she only lost the second and third sets.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nEach set's score is listed as her score first. So in Row 1:\n- Set 1: She won 6 games to 4.\n- Set 2: She lost 4 games to 6.\n- Set 3: She lost 4 games to 6.\n\nSo, in the sets she lost (Sets 2 and 3), she scored 4 games each. So per loss set, she averaged 4 games.\n\nBut how many losses does she have? Each row where she is runner-up represents a match loss. So for Row 1: She played three sets but lost overall, so her total games across the entire match would be 6 + 4 + 4 = 14 games. Similarly, for other rows:\n\nRow 3: Outcome Runner-up\nScore: 3-6, 4-6\nSo she scored 3 and 4 in each set. So total games in this match: 3 + 4 = 7.\n\nWait, but it's a two-set match because both sets were lost. So her total games would be 3 (from first set) + 4 (second set) = 7 games.\n\nRow 4: Outcome Runner-up\nScore: 6-7, 4-6\nShe scored 6 in the first set and 4 in the second. Total games: 6 + 4 = 10.\n\nNow, let's calculate her total games across all losses:\n\nRow 1: 6 + 4 + 4 = 14 (but wait, she only lost two sets here, so perhaps considering only the lost sets? Or the entire match?)\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. The claim says \"on average... lose with only 4 point.\" If it's per set when she loses, then in Row 1, she lost two sets with 4 points each; in Row 3, she lost two sets but scored 3 and 4 games; and in Row 4, she lost one set with 6 and another with 4.\n\nWait no, let me re-examine the scores:\n\nRow 1: Runner-up\nSets: 6-4 (win), 4-6 (loss), 4-6 (loss)\nSo in the two sets she lost, she scored 4 games each. So per losing set, she had 4 points.\n\nRow 3: Runner-up\nScore: 3-6, 4-6\nShe lost both sets, scoring 3 and 4 games respectively.\n\nRow 4: Runner-up\nScore: 6-7 (loss), 4-6 (loss)\nShe scored 6 in the first set loss and 4 in the second.\n\nSo, across all losing sets:\n\nRow1: two losses with 4 each\nRow3: two losses with 3 and 4\nRow4: two losses with 6 and 4\n\nTotal losing games per set:\nFrom Row1: 4, 4\nFrom Row3: 3, 4\nFrom Row4: 6, 4\n\nSo total points across all lost sets: 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 25\n\nNumber of losing sets: 6 (Row1 has two, Row3 has two, Row4 has two).\n\nAverage points per losing set: 25 / 6 \u2248 4.17.\n\nBut the claim says she loses with only 4 points on average. So 4.17 is close to 4, but not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider total games across all lost matches (each row being a match loss), then:\n\nRow1: Total games (all sets) = 6 + 4 + 4 = 14\nBut she only lost two sets here; maybe considering the total games in the losing sets: 4 + 4 = 8\n\nRow3: Total games in losing sets: 3 + 4 =7\n\nRow4: Total games in losing sets:6 +4=10\n\nTotal across all matches: 8 +7 +10 =25\nNumber of losing matches: 3\nAverage per match: 25 /3 \u22488.33, which is way higher than 4.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the claim refers to points per set when she loses a set, not per match. So in all her lost sets, the average was ~4.17, which is approximately 4.\n\nSo maybe the answer is yes, but since 4.17 is more than 4, it's not exactly matching. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider just the number of games she lost in each match:\n\nRow1: She lost two sets where she scored 4 and 4 (so total 8)\nBut actually, no\u2014 she lost those sets by scores of 6-4 each. So she lost 2 games in each set.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is about points per game? No, that seems too detailed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's considering only the losing sets' her score:\n\nRow1: two sets with 4\nRow3: two sets with 3 and 4\nRow4: two sets with6 and4\n\nTotal points in losing sets:4+4+3+4+6+4=25\nNumber of losing sets:6\nAverage per losing set: ~4.17, which is about 4.\n\nSo the claim that she loses with only 4 points on average could be considered approximately true, but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating something else.\n\nWait, another approach: Each row represents a match where she lost. So for each of these three matches:\n\nRow1: She played three sets and lost two (sets). Her scores in the losing sets were 4 each.\nSo per losing set in Row1: 4 points.\n\nRow3: Two losing sets with 3 and 4, so average of 3.5 per losing set.\n\nRow4: Two losing sets with6 and4, average of5.\n\nNow, total across all losing sets:\n\nFrom Row1: two at4\nFrom Row3: two at3.5\nFrom Row4: two at5\n\nTotal points: (2*4) + (2*3.5)+(2*5)=8+7+10=25\n\nAverage per losing set: 25 /6\u22484.17.\n\nSo again, the average is about4.17, which is close to4 but not exactly. So maybe the answer is yes, approximately.\n\nBut since in two of her losses (Row3 and Row4), she had some sets where she scored more or less than4, it's not a consistent 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting \"points.\" Maybe it refers to points in total across all lost matches. But that would be higher.\n\nWait, the scores are given in games, not points. So perhaps it's about games per set when she loses.\n\nIf we consider the losing sets:\n\nRow1: two sets where she scored4 each (lost 6-4)\nSo average of4\n\nRow3: two sets where she scored3 and4\nAverage is3.5\n\nRow4: two sets where she scored6 and4\nAverage is5\n\nOverall, across all losing sets:\n\n(2*4)+(1*3)+(2*4)+(1*6) =8+3+8+6=25. Wait no, that's not the right way.\n\nWait, each match has a certain number of lost sets:\n\nRow1: two lost sets (each with 4 games)\nRow3: two lost sets (3 and4)\nRow4: two lost sets (6 and4)\n\nSo total across all losing sets:\n\nFrom Row1:4+4=8\n\nFrom Row3:3+4=7\n\nFrom Row4:6+4=10\n\nTotal points in all losing sets:8+7+10=25\n\nNumber of losing sets:2+2+2=6\n\nAverage per losing set:25/6\u22484.17.\n\nSo, approximately 4.17 points per losing set on average.\n\nThe claim says she loses with only 4 points on average, which is pretty close but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to know if the average is exactly4, in which case it's no.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe considering each row as a match loss and total games she scored:\n\nRow1:6-4, 4-6, 4-6 (assuming this is how the sets went). Wait, not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking at the player's performance across all matches, calculating average points per set when losing.\n\nBut without more data, it's hard to say. Based on the given scores, the average is ~4.17.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is yes, approximately 4 points on average.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the player loses with an average of exactly 4 points per set across all their lost sets:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Points in Losing Sets:**\n   - From Row1 (two lost sets): 4 + 4 = 8\n   - From Row3 (two lost sets): 3 + 4 = 7\n   - From Row4 (two lost sets): 6 + 4 = 10\n\n2. **Sum Total Points:**\n   - 8 (Row1) + 7 (Row3) + 10 (Row4) = 25 points\n\n3. **Determine Number of Losing Sets:**\n   - Each row has two lost sets, so total losing sets = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6\n\n4. **Calculate Average Points per Losing Set:**\n   - 25 points / 6 sets \u2248 4.17 points per set\n\nSince the average is approximately 4.17 points per set, which is slightly more than 4, the player does not lose with exactly an average of 4 points per set.\n\n**Answer:** No, the player loses with an average of approximately 4.17 points per set across all their lost sets.",
