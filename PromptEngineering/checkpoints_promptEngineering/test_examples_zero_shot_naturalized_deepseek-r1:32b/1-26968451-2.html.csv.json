I need to determine whether the claim \"michael lembeck direct series number 39, fly solo\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n1. **Director**: The claim states that Michael Lembeck directed a specific episode.\n2. **Series Number and Title**: The episode in question is Series 39 with the title \"flying solo.\"\n\nNext, I'll refer to the table provided to verify these details.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents an episode with columns for series number, season, title, director, writer(s), and original airdate. The rows are indexed from 1 to 23 in the given data (though some series numbers go beyond that). \n\nI'll search through the rows to find where Series 39 is mentioned.\n\n- **Row 13**: This row corresponds to Series 39, Season 13. The title listed here is \"flying solo.\" The director for this entry is Michael Lembeck, as specified in the claim.\n\nNow, I'll cross-check each part of the claim against this row:\n- **Director Check**: The table confirms that Michael Lembeck directed this episode.\n- **Series Number and Title Check**: Series 39's title matches \"flying solo\" exactly.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are accurately reflected in Row 13 of the table, there's no discrepancy. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the data provided.\n\nI should also consider any possible ambiguities or alternative interpretations:\n- The series numbers in the table go from 27 up to at least 49, so Series 39 falls well within this range.\n- The title \"flying solo\" is unique and clearly linked to Series 39 in Row 13.\n\nThere's no conflicting information elsewhere in the table that would contradict this claim. All other rows either have different series numbers or different titles when directed by Michael Lembeck, but none of them present a conflicting directive for Series 39.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim is TRUE because both the director and the specific episode details align perfectly with the data in Row 13.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the claim \"series number 39 be write by michael lembeck\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that series number 39 was written by Michael Lembeck. So, my goal is to check two things: whether series number 39 exists in the table and who wrote it.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different series with details like season, title, director, writer(s), and original airdate. The rows are numbered from 1 to 23, but looking closely, I see that the series numbers go up to 49. Wait, actually, the rows in the provided data are listed as Row 1 through Row 23, but each row corresponds to a specific series number and season. For example, Row 1 is Series 27, Season 1, and so on.\n\nTo find series number 39, I'll need to scan through these rows. Let's go through them one by one:\n\n- Row 1: Series 27\n- Row 2: Series 28\n- ...\n- Row 13: Series 39\n\nAh, here it is in Row 13. Now, the claim mentions that this series was written by Michael Lembeck. Let's look at the \"written by\" column for that row.\n\nIn Row 13, under \"written by\", it says Leslie Rieder, not Michael Lembeck. Michael Lembeck is listed as the director, but the writer is someone else. \n\nSo, the claim is incorrect because series number 39 was written by Leslie Rieder, not Michael Lembeck. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nTo summarize:\n- Series 39 exists (Row 13).\n- The writer for that series is Leslie Rieder.\n- Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row 13's \"written by\" column, which shows Leslie Rieder as the writer.\n- Additionally, checking if Michael Lembeck was involved elsewhere (like directing) confirms he wasn't the writer in this case.\n\nTherefore, the answer is FALSE, and the relevant cell is in Row 13 under \"written by\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that series number 39 was written by Michael Lembeck. Checking the table, series number 39 is found in row 13. The \"written by\" column for this row lists Leslie Rieder as the writer. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"written by\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
