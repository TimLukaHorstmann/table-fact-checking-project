    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says, \"the word friday in the polish language be pi\u0105tek.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what we're looking for. We need information about how Friday is expressed in Polish. So, we should check the row that corresponds to Polish and then look at the cell under the column where Friday is listed.\n\nLooking through the rows, I see that Row 17 is Hungarian, Row 18 is Estonian, Row 19 is Simplified Chinese (in Pinyin), Row 20 is Mongolian (numerical), etc. Wait, no, actually, in the provided data, each row represents a different language or script system.\n\nWait, let me check again. The rows go from 1 to 22. Let's see:\n\nRow 5: Bulgarian\nRow 6: Ukrainian\nRow 7: Belarusian\nRow 8: Serbian (Latin)\nRow 9: Croatian\nRow 10: Slovenian\nRow 11: Czech\nRow 12: Slovak\nRow 13: Polish\n\nAh, yes, Row 13 is Polish. So in that row, the days are listed from Monday to Sunday.\n\nLooking at Row 13 (Polish), I see the Friday entry under the fifth day column. The word given is \"pi\u0105tek.\" \n\nSo, according to the table, the claim that Friday in Polish is \"pi\u0105tek\" is accurate. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 13,\n       \"column_name\": \"Friday\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says that \"the word Saturday in the Croatian language be subota.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that each row in the table represents a different language and provides the terms for days of the week. So, I should look for the row corresponding to Croatian.\n\nLooking through the rows, I see Row 3 is Croatian. In that row, under the column \"saturday sixth day,\" it lists \"subota.\" That matches exactly with what the claim states. \n\nWait, let me double-check. The claim says \"the word Saturday in Croatian is subota.\" Yes, and in the table, for Croatian, the Saturday entry is indeed subota. So that's a direct match.\n\nI don't think there are any other relevant cells here because the claim specifically mentions Croatian and Saturday. Other rows might have similar words, but since we're only concerned with Croatian, those aren't necessary to consider.\n\nSo, based on Row 3, the sixth day (Saturday) is subota in Croatian. That supports the claim fully.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"saturday sixth day\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"subota be the mongolian word for sunday\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The claim is about the Mongolian word for Sunday being \"subota.\" I'll check the table for any rows related to Mongolian language entries because that's where the relevant information should be.\n\nLooking at the table, I see two rows mentioning\u8499\u53e4\u8bed (Mongolian). They are Row 20 and Row 21. \n\nRow 20 lists days in Mongolian using numerical terms:\n- Monday: \u043d\u044d\u0433 \u0434\u044d\u0445 \u04e9\u0434\u04e9\u0440\n- Tuesday: \u0445\u043e\u0451\u0440 \u0434\u0430\u0445\u044c \u04e9\u0434\u04e9\u0440\n- Wednesday: \u0433\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u0434\u0430\u0445\u044c \u04e9\u0434\u04e9\u0440\n- Thursday: \u0434\u04e9\u0440\u04e9\u0432 \u0434\u044d\u0445 \u04e9\u0434\u04e9\u0440\n- Friday: \u0442\u0430\u0432 \u0434\u0430\u0445\u044c \u04e9\u0434\u04e9\u0440\n- Saturday: \u0445\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0441 \u0441\u0430\u0439\u043d \u04e9\u0434\u04e9\u0440\n- Sunday: \u0431\u04af\u0442\u044d\u043d \u0441\u0430\u0439\u043d \u04e9\u0434\u04e9\u0440\n\nNone of these entries for the days include \"subota.\" \n\nRow 21 uses Tibetan terms for the days in Mongolian:\n- Monday: davaa\n- Tuesday: myagmar\n- Wednesday: lhagva\n- Thursday: p\u00fcrev\n- Friday: baasan\n- Saturday: byamba\n- Sunday: nym\n\nAgain, \"subota\" isn't listed here either. \n\nI should also check other languages to see if \"subota\" appears elsewhere. For example, looking at the Hungarian row (Row 17), I don't see it. The Russian or other Slavic languages might use a similar term, but since the claim is about Mongolian, those aren't relevant here.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in Rows 20 and 21, \"subota\" isn't listed as the word for Sunday in either of the Mongolian entries. The correct terms are \u0431\u04af\u0442\u044d\u043d \u0441\u0430\u0439\u043d \u04e9\u0434\u00f6r (Row 20) and \u043d\u044f\u043c (Row 21). \n\nSo, the claim is false because \"subota\" doesn't appear in the Mongolian language entries for Sunday.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"subota\" is the Mongolian word for Sunday. Checking the relevant rows (20 and 21), neither lists \"subota.\" The correct terms are provided, so the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"mongolian  (numerical)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"mongolian  (tibetan)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
