Scanning the rows, I see that Row 25 mentions 'vietnam' under the 'country / region' column. \n\nNow, checking this row's details: The languages listed are 'vietnamese'. So, according to the table, Vietnam's language is Vietnamese.\n\nSince the claim exactly matches what's stated in the table, the answer should be TRUE. The relevant cell is Row 25, specifically the 'languages' column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 24,\n       \"column_name\": \"country / region\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 24,\n       \"column_name\": \"languages\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break down each part of the claim and check against the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for entries where the country/region is Israel. Scanning through the rows, row 12 has \"country / region: israel\". \n\nNow, checking the languages column in that row. It says \"hebrew\", which matches the first part of the claim about being in Hebrew. \n\nNext, I need to verify if the status is ongoing. The status for row 12 is listed as \"discontinued\". Wait, but the claim says it should be ongoing. That's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, did I read that correctly? Let me double-check. Row 12: country is Israel, languages are Hebrew, and status is discontinued. So the show in Israel is not ongoing; it's discontinued. \n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim don't hold true because while the language matches, the status does not. The claim states it should be ongoing, but according to the table, it's discontinued.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks for the show in Israel being in Hebrew and ongoing. The relevant data shows it's in Hebrew but is discontinued.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"country / region\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"languages\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"status\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
