    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"wozniak have compete in canada 5 time and win every time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that Wozniak competed five times in Canada and won each of those competitions. To verify this, I need to look through the table entries where the tournament location is Canada and check if Wozniak was the winner each time.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 12 rows. Each row has information about a tournament outcome, date, location, surface type, opponent, and score. My focus will be on the \"outcome\" and \"tournament\" columns for each row to identify matches in Canada where Wozniak competed.\n\nLet's go through each relevant row:\n\nRow 1: Outcome is winner, Tournament is Lachine, Canada. So this counts as a win in Canada.\nRow 2: Outcome is winner, Tournament is Hamilton, Canada. Another win in Canada.\nRow 6: Outcome is winner, Tournament is Toronto, Canada. Third win in Canada.\nRow 7: Outcome is winner, Tournament is Hamilton, Canada. Fourth win here.\nRow 11: Outcome is winner, Tournament is Vancouver, Canada. Fifth win in Canada.\n\nSo that's five tournaments in Canada where Wozniak won. Now, I should check if there are any other tournaments in Canada with a different outcome or additional wins beyond these five.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRows 3 and 5 are runner-up but not in Canada. Rows 4,8,9,10,12: These are either in the US, Mexico, Bahamas, etc., so they don't affect our count for Canada.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check to ensure I haven't missed any other Canadian tournaments beyond these five. Scanning all rows:\n\nRow 1: Lachine (Canada) - win\nRow 2: Hamilton (Canada) - win\nRow 6: Toronto (Canada) - win\nRow 7: Hamilton (Canada) - win\nRow 11: Vancouver (Canada) - win\n\nThat's five wins in Canada. The claim says Wozniak competed five times and won every time, which matches exactly with what I've found here.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"wozniak compete in 5 tournament in 2005 and win 3 of them\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that Wozniak competed in five tournaments in the year 2005 and won three of those. So, my task is to check if this statement holds true according to the data provided in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different tournament with details like outcome, date, tournament location, surface type, opponent, and score. My goal is to extract all rows that occurred in 2005 and then determine how many tournaments Wozniak competed in and how many of those she won.\n\nStarting with identifying the relevant years: I'll go through each row's \"date\" column to see which entries fall within 2005. \n\nRow 1: Date is June 30, 2002 \u2013 that's outside 2005.\nRow 2: July 17, 2005 \u2013 this is in 2005.\nRow 3: October 2, 2005 \u2013 also 2005.\nRow 4: October 16, 2005 \u2013 yes, 2005.\nRow 5: October 23, 2005 \u2013 again in 2005.\nRow 6: November 13, 2005 \u2013 still within 2005.\nRows 7 to 12 are from 2006 and later years, so they don't count.\n\nSo, the relevant rows for 2005 are Rows 2 through 6. That's five tournaments in total (Row 2: Hamilton, Canada; Row3: Pelham, USA; Row4: Victoria, Mexico; Row5: Mexico City, Mexico; Row6: Toronto, Canada). \n\nNext, I need to check how many of these five tournaments Wozniak won. Looking at the \"outcome\" column:\n\nRow 2: Outcome is winner.\nRow3: Outcome is runner-up.\nRow4: Winner.\nRow5: Runner-up.\nRow6: Winner.\n\nSo out of Rows 2-6, she was a winner in three instances (Rows 2, 4, and 6) and a runner-up twice (Rows 3 and 5). \n\nTherefore, the claim that she competed in five tournaments in 2005 is accurate because there are five entries. Additionally, she won three of them, which matches the second part of the claim. Both parts of the statement hold true based on the data provided.\n\nI should also make sure I'm not missing any other entries from 2005. Let me double-check Rows 1 through 6:\n\nRow 1: 2002 \u2013 no\nRows 2-6: all 2005 except Row7 is 2006, which I've already accounted for.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_2_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_3_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_4_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_5_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_6_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_7_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_8_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_9_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_10_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"wozniak have only compete in the bahamas 1 time but win\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It's saying that Wozniak competed only once in the Bahamas and won that match.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a tournament outcome for Wozniak. I should check if there are any rows where the tournament location is the Bahamas and whether she won or lost those matches.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Lachine, Canada\n- Row 2: Hamilton, Canada\n- Row 3: Pelham, United States\n- Row 4: Victoria, Mexico\n- Row 5: Mexico City, Mexico\n- Row 6: Toronto, Canada\n- Row 7: Hamilton, Canada\n- Row 8: Ashland, United States\n- Row 9: Pittsburgh, United States\n- Row 10: Redding, United States\n- Row 11: Vancouver, Canada\n- Row 12: Nassau, Bahamas\n\nSo the only row with Bahamas is Row 12. The outcome in this row is \"winner\", so she won that tournament.\n\nNow, checking if she competed only once there. Since there's only one entry for the Bahamas (Row 12), it means she competed once and won.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Wozniak competed once in the Bahamas and won.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It says that Wozniak has been a runner-up three times and that none of those runner-up finishes were in Canada. So, two parts to check: the number of runner-up outcomes and whether any of them occurred in Canada.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 12 rows, each representing a different match or tournament result for Wozniak. Each row has details like outcome, date, tournament location, surface type, opponent, and score.\n\nI need to go through each row and count how many times the outcome is \"runner - up\". Let's check each one:\n\nRow 1: Outcome is winner \u2013 not runner-up.\nRow 2: Winner again. Not relevant.\nRow 3: Runner-up. That's the first instance.\nRow 4: Winner. So, not relevant.\nRow 5: Runner-up. Second instance.\nRow 6: Winner. Not needed.\nRow 7: Winner. Moving on.\nRow 8: Winner. Still winner.\nRow 9: Winner again. Not applicable.\nRow 10: Runner-up here. Third instance.\nRows 11 and 12: Both winners.\n\nSo, from rows 3,5,10 \u2013 three instances where Wozniak was runner-up. That matches the first part of the claim: \"runner - up 3 time\".\n\nNow, for each of these runner-up entries, I need to check if any were in Canada. Let's look at the tournament locations:\n\nRow 3: Pelham, United States \u2013 not Canada.\nRow 5: Mexico City, Mexico \u2013 also not Canada.\nRow 10: Redding, United States \u2013 again, not Canada.\n\nSo none of Wozniak's runner-up finishes were in Canada.

The player in question is presumably Wozniak, but since the table doesn't specify her name directly, I'm assuming all these entries are about the same person.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Date June 30, 2002 \u2013 within range and outcome is winner. Count = 1.\nRow 2: July 17, 2005 \u2013 within range and winner. Count = 2.\nRow 3: October 2, 2005 \u2013 within range but runner-up.

The user is asking whether the claim \"Wozniak compete in 5 tournaments in 2006 and win 3 of them\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table contains. It has multiple rows, each representing a tournament outcome with details like date, tournament name, surface type, opponent, score, and whether Wozniak was the winner or runner-up.\n\nThe claim states two things:\n1. Wozniak competed in 5 tournaments in 2006.\n2. She won 3 of them.\n\nSo, I need to check both aspects using the table data.\n\nStarting with the first part: How many tournaments did she compete in during 2006? I'll look through each row and note the date to see which ones fall within 2006.\n\nLooking at each row:\n- Row 1: June 30, 2002 \u2192 Not 2006.\n- Row 2: July 17, 2005 \u2192 Not 2006.\n- Row 3: October 2, 2005 \u2192 Not 2006.\n- Row 4: October 16, 2005 \u2192 Not 2006.\n- Row 5: October 23, 2005 \u2192 Not 2006.\n- Row 6: November 13, 2005 \u2192 Not 2006.\n- Row 7: July 23, 2006 \u2192 Yes.\n- Row 8: October 1, 2006 \u2192 Yes.\n- Row 9: November 12, 2006 \u2192 Yes.\n- Row 10: March 23, 2008 \u2192 Not 2006.\n- Row 11: August 7, 2011 \u2192 Not 2006.\n- Row 12: March 17, 2012 \u2192 Not 2006.\n\nSo in 2006, there are three entries: rows 7, 8, and 9. That's only three tournaments, not five as the claim states. Therefore, the first part of the claim is already incorrect.\n\nMoving on to the second part for thoroughness: How many did she win? Looking at those three rows:\n- Row 7: Outcome is winner.\n- Row 8: Outcome is winner.\n- Row 9: Outcome is winner (since it's listed as \"winner\" and opponent is mentioned with a score, though the second set was retired but still counts as a win).\n\nSo she did win all three tournaments in 2006. However, since she only competed in three, not five, the overall claim is false.\n\nThus, both parts of the claim are not supported by the table data. The relevant cells are rows 7-9, which show her participation and wins in 2006.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"wozniak have only compete in the bahamas 2 time but lose\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It states that Wozniak has competed in the Bahamas exactly two times and lost both competitions. So, I need to check how many times she played in the Bahamas and whether she won or lost those matches.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 1: Lachine, Canada\nRow 2: Hamilton, Canada\nRow 3: Pelham, United States\nRow 4: Victoria, Mexico\nRow 5: Mexico City, Mexico\nRow 6: Toronto, Canada\nRow 7: Hamilton, Canada\nRow 8: Ashland, United States\nRow 9: Pittsburgh, United States\nRow 10: Redding, United States\nRow 11: Vancouver, Canada\nRow 12: Nassau, Bahamas\n\nI'll go through each row to find any mentions of the Bahamas. \n\nLooking at Row 12, the tournament location is Nassau, Bahamas. The outcome here is \"winner\", so Wozniak won this match.\n\nNow, I check all other rows for Bahamas entries. Rows 1-11 don't mention the Bahamas except for Row 12. So there's only one instance where she competed in the Bahamas according to this table.\n\nThe claim says she competed twice and lost both times. But from the table, she only competed once in the Bahamas (Row 12) and won. Therefore, the claim is incorrect on two points: the number of competitions and the outcome.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because she only competed once and was a winner.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Wozniak competed twice in the Bahamas and lost both times. However, the table shows only one competition in Nassau (Bahamas) where she won.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n     {\"row_26\": 12, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim \"wozniak have be winner 3 time but never in canada\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I need to parse the claim correctly. It seems like there might be a typo in the name \"wozniak.\" Since the table doesn't mention this name directly, maybe it's referring to someone else, perhaps \"Wozniak,\" but more likely, considering the context of tennis tournaments and the opponent names listed, it might actually be referring to \"Azarenka\" or another player. Alternatively, maybe the claim is about a specific player whose name isn't in the table, but I should check if any row indicates Wozniak as the winner.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Winner (Canada)\n- Row 2: Winner (Canada)\n- Row 4: Winner (Mexico)\n- Row 6: Winner (Canada)\n- Row 7: Winner (Canada)\n- Row 8: Winner (USA)\n- Row 9: Winner (USA)\n- Row 11: Winner (Canada)\n- Row 12: Winner (Bahamas)\n\nWait, I don't see any rows where the outcome is \"winner\" and the player's name is Wozniak. The opponents include names like Beier Ko, Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri, etc., but none of the winners are named Wozniak. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because there are no entries for Wozniak as a winner.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check each row's \"opponent\" column to see if any mention Wozniak. Scanning through:\n\n- Row 1: Beier Ko\n- Row 2: Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri\n- Row 3: Soledad Esper\u00f3n\n- Row 4: Olga Blahotov\u00e1\n- Row 5: Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri\n- Row 6: Olena Antypina\n- Row 7: Val\u00e9rie T\u00e9treault\n- Row 8: \u00c1gnes Sz\u00e1vay\n- Row 9: Victoria Azarenka\n- Row 10: Barbora Z\u00e1hlavov\u00e1-Str\u00fdcov\u00e1\n- Row 11: Jamie Hampton\n- Row 12: Aliz\u00e9 Cornet\n\nNo Wozniak opponents either. So if the claim is about a player named Wozniak, there's no data here to support it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"wozniak\" was a typo for another name, like Azarenka or someone else. But without more context, I have to go with what's given. The table doesn't list any winners named Wozniak, so the claim that they've won 3 times but never in Canada isn't supported by this data.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misreading it. Perhaps \"wozniak\" is a player who appears as an opponent or winner elsewhere. Let me double-check each row's \"opponent\" and \"outcome.\" No, all opponents are different names, none of which are Wozniak. Therefore, the claim can't be TRUE because there's no data about Wozniak in this table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant to refer to someone else, but based on the given data, I have to say the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"wozniak\" has won 3 times but never in Canada. However, upon examining the table, there are no entries where a player named Wozniak appears as a winner or opponent. Therefore, the claim cannot be supported by the given data.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE  \n**Relevant Cells:** None, as there's no mention of \"wozniak\" in any row.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"wozniak have lose 9 time between the year 2002 and 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the table represents.\n\nThe table lists various tournament results for a player, with details like outcome, date, tournament name, surface type, opponent, and score. Each row corresponds to an event in the player's career between 2002 and 2012. The claim is about how many times Wozniak lost during this period.\n\nFirst, I'll check each row to see if the outcome was a loss. The outcome column has two possible values: \"winner\" or \"runner-up.\" In sports tournaments, being a runner-up typically means losing in the final. So, every time the outcome is \"runner-up,\" that's a loss.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Outcome is \"winner.\" No loss here.\n2. **Row 2**: Outcome is \"winner.\" Another win.\n3. **Row 3**: Outcome is \"runner-up.\" This counts as a loss. Total losses now: 1.\n4. **Row 4**: Outcome is \"winner.\"\n5. **Row 5**: Outcome is \"runner-up.\" That's another loss. Now total: 2.\n6. **Row 6**: Outcome is \"winner.\"\n7. **Row 7**: Outcome is \"winner.\" The score shows a third set, but she won overall.\n8. **Row 8**: Outcome is \"winner.\"\n9. **Row 9**: Outcome is \"winner.\" Note that the opponent retired in the second set (score: ret.), so it's a win by default.\n10. **Row 10**: Outcome is \"runner-up.\" Another loss, total now: 3.\n11. **Row 11**: Outcome is \"winner.\"\n12. **Row 12**: Outcome is \"winner.\"\n\nWait, that only gives me 3 losses (Rows 3, 5, and 10). The claim says 9 losses between 2002 and 2012. But according to the table, there are only 3 instances where the outcome was a runner-up.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that all rows within the date range (2002-2012) are considered. The dates in the table go up to March 2012 and include an August 2011 event as well. So all rows fall within the specified timeframe except perhaps any beyond 2012, but there aren't any here.\n\nSo, only 3 losses are present. Therefore, the claim of losing 9 times is not supported by the data. The relevant cells to check were each row's outcome column to count the runner-up instances.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Wozniak was a runner-up (lost) three times between 2002 and 2012, not nine times as claimed.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
