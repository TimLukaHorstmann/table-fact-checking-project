    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says, \"the maverick be the only team to join after 1970.\" First, I need to understand what exactly this means. It seems like it's stating that the Mavericks are the sole team that joined the league after the year 1970.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a school with details about their sports team. The columns include 'school,' 'city,' 'team name,' 'county,' 'year joined,' and 'year left.' My main focus will be on the 'team name' and 'year joined' columns to verify this claim.\n\nLet's go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: School is Attica, team name Red Ramblers, year joined 1947. That's before 1970, so not relevant here.\n2. **Row 2**: Delphi Community, Oracles, year joined 1947. Again, way before 1970.\n3. **Row 3**: Flora, Badgers, joined in 1947. Still too early.\n4. **Row 4**: Rensselaer Central, Bombers, year joined 1947. No good.\n5. **Row 5**: Rossville, Hornets, year joined 1947. Same as above.\n6. **Row 6**: Winamac, Warriors, joined in 1947. Not relevant.\n7. **Row 7**: Sheridan, Black Hawks, year joined 1948 and 2000. Hmm, the year 2000 is after 1970, so this team joined twice: once in 1948 and again in 2000.\n8. **Row 8**: Southwestern, Wildcats, year joined 1958. Still before 1970.\n9. **Row 9**: Western, Panthers, joined in 1958. Again, too early.\n10. **Row 10**: Carroll, Cougars, year joined 1961. Still before the cutoff.\n11. **Row 11**: Clinton Prairie, Gophers, joined in 1961. Also before 1970.\n12. **Row 12**: Central Catholic, Knights, year joined 1970. Exactly at the cutoff, so not after.\n13. **Row 13**: Harrison (West Lafayette), Raiders, year joined 1970. Again, exactly at 1970.\n14. **Row 14**: McCutcheon, Mavericks, year joined 1975. This is the team in question and it's after 1970.\n\nNow, based on this analysis:\n\n- The claim states that Mavericks are the only team to join after 1970.\n- Looking at Row 7, Sheridan's Black Hawks joined again in 2000, which is after 1970. So there's another team that joined after 1970 besides Mavericks.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the Mavericks are not the only team to join after 1970; the Black Hawks also joined later than 1970.\n\nThe relevant cells I checked were:\n\n- **Row 7**: Checking 'year joined' for Sheridan's team which showed two years: 1948 and 2000. The 2000 is crucial because it's after 1970.\n- **Row 14**: Checking 'year joined' for Mavericks, which was 1975.\n\nSo these are the cells that affect whether the claim holds true or not.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there's another team (Sheridan Black Hawks) that joined after 1970. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"rossville school leave the conference 30 year after join\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row that corresponds to rossville school. Scanning through the rows, Row 5 has the school name as \"rossville\". That's where all the relevant information should be.\n\nIn that row, I see the columns are: school, city, team name, county, year joined, and year left. The claim is about the years they joined and left. So, I'll focus on those two columns.\n\nThe \"year joined\" for rossville is 1947, and the \"year left\" is 1977. To find out how many years they were in the conference, I subtract the year joined from the year left: 1977 minus 1947 equals 30 years.\n\nThe claim says they left 30 years after joining, which matches exactly with this calculation. So, that would make the claim true.\n\nI should also check if there's any other row that might have conflicting information or additional details about rossville, but looking through all rows from 1 to 14, Row 5 is the only one mentioning rossville. There are no other entries for rossville in the table, so I don't need to consider anything else.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are \"year joined\" and \"year left\" from Row 5. Since both of these support the claim exactly as stated, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that rossville school left the conference 30 years after joining. Checking their years, they joined in 1947 and left in 1977, which is a 30-year span. Thus, the claim is accurate.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year left\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Scanning through the rows:\n\nRow 7 is Sheridan, city Sheridan.\nRow 8 is Southwestern, Lafayette.\nRow 9 is Western, Russiaville.\nRow 10 is Carroll, Flora.\nRow 11 is Clinton Prairie, Frankfort.\nRow 12: Central Catholic, Lafayette.\nRow 13: Harrison (West Lafayette), West Lafayette.\n\nSo Row 13 has the city of West Lafayette. The team there joined in 1970.\n\nThe claim says that Attica's team left before West Lafayette's team joined. Attica left in 1966, and West Lafayette joined in 1970. Since 1966 is before 1970, the statement holds true.\n\nI need to list the relevant cells:\n\nFor Attica:\n- Row 1, column \"year left\"\n\nFor West Lafayette (Row 13):\n- Row 13, column \"year joined\"\n\nSo both these cells are necessary to support the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year left\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. The phrase \"the hornet\" refers to a specific team name in the table, which is likely the Hornets from Row 5. The claim states that this team isn't the only one from 12 Clinton County. So, I need to check if there are other teams listed under county 12 clinton besides the Hornets.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school with its respective details. I'll focus on the 'county' and 'team name' columns for each row.\n\nStarting from Row 5: The team is Hornets, located in County 12 Clinton. Now, I'll go through the rest of the rows to see if any other teams are also from county 12 clinton.\n\nRow 13 mentions Clinton Prairie, city Frankfort, team Gophers, county 12 Clinton. So that's another team from 12 Clinton County. Therefore, Hornets aren't the only ones; Gophers are also there.\n\nSo, since there is at least one more team (Gophers) in 12 Clinton County besides Hornets, the claim holds true.

I need to find their respective rows in the table to get their leaving years. \n\nLooking at Row 5, it's about rossville. The year left is 1977. Then, for clinton prairie, that's Row 11 with a year left of 1974.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the difference between these two years. So, subtracting 1974 from 1977 gives me 3 years. The claim says they leave 3 years apart, which matches my calculation.\n\nI should also make sure there are no other schools or entries that might affect this. Checking all rows, I see only rossville and clinton prairie have those names, so no confusion there.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the difference in their leaving years is exactly three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year left\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"year left\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine whether the claim \"rensselaer central in rossville , join in 1958 and leave in 1966\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. It mentions two schools: rensselaer central and rossville. Wait, no, actually, it says \"rensselaer central in rossville\". That could be interpreted as rensselaer central being located in rossville, or perhaps that both are involved. But looking at the table, each row represents a single school with its details.\n\nI'll check the table for rows where either the school is rensselaer central or the city is rossville. \n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 4: school: rensselaer central, city: rensselaer\n- Row 5: school: rossville, city: rossville\n\nSo, rensselaer central is in rensselaer, not rossville. The claim seems to confuse two different schools.\n\nNext, the claim states that rensselaer central joined in 1958 and left in 1966. Let's check row 4 for rensselaer central:\n\n- year joined: 1947\n- year left: 1949\n\nThis doesn't match the claim at all.\n\nAdditionally, checking rossville (row 5):\n\n- year joined: 1947\n- year left: 1977\n\nAgain, this doesn't align with the years in the claim.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are incorrect.

It states that there's only one team from Clinton County (which is identified as '12 clinton') and only one team from Carroll County ('08 carroll'). So, I need to check how many teams are associated with each of these counties in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a school along with details like county. Let's go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Attica - county 23 fountain\n- Row 2: Delphi Community - county 08 carroll\n- Row 3: Flora - county 08 carroll\n- Row 4: Rensselaer Central - county 37 jasper\n- Row 5: Rossville - county 12 clinton\n- Row 6: Winamac - county 66 pulaski\n- Row 7: Sheridan - county 29 hamilton\n- Row 8: Southwestern - county 79 tippecanoe\n- Row 9: Western - county 34 howard\n- Row 10: Carroll - county 08 carroll\n- Row 11: Clinton Prairie - county 12 clinton\n- Row 12: Central Catholic - county 79 tippecanoe\n- Row 13: Harrison (West Lafayette) - county 79 tippecanoe\n- Row 14: McCutcheon - county 79 tippecanoe\n\nNow, focusing on counties '12 clinton' and '08 carroll':\n\nFor 12 Clinton County:\n- Row 5: Rossville is in 12 clinton.\n- Row 11: Clinton Prairie is also in 12 clinton.\n\nSo that's two teams from Clinton County, which contradicts the claim of only one team joining from there.\n\nFor Carroll County (08 carroll):\n- Row 2: Delphi Community\n- Row 3: Flora\n- Row 10: Carroll\n\nThat's three teams from Carroll County, again contradicting the claim of just one team.\n\nWait a minute. The initial thought was correct, but let me double-check in case I misread something. The counties are clearly listed as '08 carroll' for Delphi Community, Flora, and Carroll schools, making three entries. For Clinton County, Rossville and Clinton Prairie are both under '12 clinton', so two teams.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's more than one team from each of these counties.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states only one team each from 12 Clinton and Carroll counties joined, but the table shows two teams in Clinton County (Rossville, Clinton Prairie) and three in Carroll County (Delphi Community, Flora, Carroll).

The goal is to determine whether the claim \"the team from carroll join in 1970 , before harrison (west lafayette) join\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is referring to. The claim mentions two teams: one from Carroll and another from Harrison (West Lafayette). It states that Carroll joined in 1970 before Harrison joined. So, I need to check the joining years for both teams in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a school with details like school name, city, team name, county, year joined, and year left. The rows are indexed from 1 to 14 as per the user's description.\n\nI'll start by finding the relevant rows for Carroll and Harrison (West Lafayette).\n\nFor Carroll:\n- I scan through each row until I find a school named \"carroll\". Row 10 shows: school: carroll, city: flora, team name: cougars, county: 08 carroll, year joined: 1961, year left: 1977. So, Carroll joined in 1961.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says Carroll joined in 1970. That's conflicting because according to the table, Carroll actually joined earlier than that. This might indicate an error in the claim or perhaps I misread it. Let me double-check: Row 10 clearly states year joined as 1961.\n\nNow for Harrison (West Lafayette):\n- I look through each row until I find \"harrison (west lafayette)\". That's in Row 13: school: harrison (west lafayette), city: west lafayette, team name: raiders, county: 79 tippecanoe, year joined: 1970, year left: 1997. So, Harrison joined in 1970.\n\nWait, the claim says that Carroll joined in 1970 before Harrison. But from the table, Carroll joined in 1961 and Harrison in 1970. That means Carroll joined earlier than Harrison, which would make the claim TRUE if it's about the order, but the claim specifically states that Carroll joined in 1970, which is incorrect.\n\nHold on, let me clarify: The claim says \"Carroll join in 1970 before Harrison.\" But according to the table, Carroll joined in 1961 and left in 1977. So, if the claim states that Carroll's joining year was 1970, which is incorrect, then the entire statement is false because Carroll didn't join in 1970 at all.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the claim. Maybe it means that Carroll joined before Harrison did. But since Carroll joined in 1961 and Harrison in 1970, Carroll indeed joined earlier. However, the problem with the claim is that it incorrectly states the year as 1970 for Carroll.\n\nWait no, perhaps I should parse the claim again: \"the team from carroll join in 1970 , before harrison (west lafayette) join.\" So it's saying two things:\n1. Carroll joined in 1970.\n2. This was before Harrison joined.\n\nFrom the table, Carroll actually joined in 1961, not 1970. So the first part of the claim is incorrect. Therefore, the entire statement is false because the year given for Carroll's joining is wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me check again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Looking at Row 10: school: carroll, year joined: 1961. So yes, it's 1961, not 1970. Therefore, the claim that they joined in 1970 is incorrect.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because the joining year for Carroll as stated in the claim doesn't match the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So I need to find the year both schools joined and check the difference between those years.\n\nLooking at the table, let's identify the rows for Winamac and Southwestern. \n\nWinamac is in Row 6: \n- School: winamac\n- Year Joined: 1947\n\nSouthwestern is in Row 8:\n- School: southwestern\n- Year Joined: 1958\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1958 minus 1947 is only 11 years. But let me double-check to make sure I'm looking at the correct rows.\n\nRow 6 for Winamac says Year Joined: 1947 and Year Left: 1972.\nRow 8 for Southwestern says Year Joined: 1958 and Year Left: 1966.\n\nSo, according to this, Winamac joined in 1947, and Southwestern joined in 1958. The difference between these years is 1958 - 1947 = 11 years. \n\nThe claim says \"10 year after,\" so the expected difference should be 10 years for it to be TRUE. However, it's actually 11 years apart. Therefore, the claim isn't accurate\u2014it\u2019s off by one year.\n\nTo confirm, let me recheck the rows:\n- Winamac (Row 6): Joined in 1947\n- Southwestern (Row 8): Joined in 1958\n\nYes, that's correct. So the difference is indeed 11 years, not 10. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- For Winamac: Year Joined\n- For Southwestern: Year Joined\n\nThese are the two columns we need to compare to assess the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
