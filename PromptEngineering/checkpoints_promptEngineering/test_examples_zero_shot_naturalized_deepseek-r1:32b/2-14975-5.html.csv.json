    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"90 game be play for the series for the sawhorse dollar trophy\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It mentions 90 games played for a series involving the \"sawhorse dollar\" trophy. So my goal is to find in which row of the table this trophy appears and check if the number of games played matches 90.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n1. Row 1: Teams are Columbia vs Cornell, Trophy is Empire Cup.\n2. Row 2: Teams are Cornell vs Penn, Trophy is Trustee's Cup.\n3. Row 3: Teams are Dartmouth vs Princeton, Trophy is Sawhorse Dollar.\n4. Row 4: Teams are Harvard vs Yale, Trophy is none.\n5. Row 5: Teams are Princeton vs Yale, Trophy is none.\n\nSo the \"sawhorse dollar\" trophy is in Row 3. Now, checking the games played for this row: it says 90 games. The series record is 43-43-4, which adds up to 90 games (43+43+4=90). Therefore, the claim that 90 games were played for the series involving the Sawhorse Dollar Trophy is correct.\n\nThe relevant cells are in Row 3. Specifically, I need to look at \"games played\" and \"trophy\". The \"games played\" cell confirms the number of games, and the \"trophy\" cell confirms it's the Sawhorse Dollar. \n\nSo the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"games played\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"trophy\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"more than 100 game be play for the series with the sawhorse dollar trophy\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row of the table to find where the Sawhorse Dollar Trophy is mentioned. Scanning through:\n\n- Row 1: Trophy is Empire Cup.\n- Row 2: Trophy is Trustee's Cup.\n- Row 3: Trophy is Sawhorse Dollar. Okay, this is relevant.\n- Rows 4 and 5 don't mention Sawhorse Dollar.\n\nSo the relevant row is Row 3. Now, checking the number of games played for this series. In Row 3, under \"games played\" it says 90 games. The claim states that more than 100 games were played, but here it's only 90. \n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because 90 is less than 100.\n\nI need to note which cells are relevant. For Row 3, both \"teams\" and \"games played\" columns are important because they identify the series with the trophy and the number of games respectively.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant row for the Sawhorse Dollar Trophy is Row 3, where \"games played\" shows 90, which is less than 100.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"teams\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"games played\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
