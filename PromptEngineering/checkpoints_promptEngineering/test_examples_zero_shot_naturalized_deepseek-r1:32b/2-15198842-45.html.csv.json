    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the only defensive tackle be corey peter , with a pick number of 19\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n1. Corey Peters is the only defensive tackle.\n2. He was picked at pick number 19.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 2 has the name \"corey peters\", position \"defensive tackle\", and pick number 19 (round 3, pick 19, overall 83). This matches the claim for both his role as a defensive tackle and the pick number.\n  \nNow, checking if there are any other defensive tackles:\n- Scanning all rows, only Row 2 has \"defensive tackle\" as the position. So Corey Peters is indeed the only one with that position.\n\nAdditionally, verifying the pick number:\n- His pick number is 19 in round 3, which is correct.\n\nThus, both parts of the claim are supported by the table. The relevant cells are the position and pick for Corey Peters.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as Corey Peters is the sole defensive tackle picked at number 19.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
