    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"none of the latvian submission be nominated for best foreign language film\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It states that none of the Latvian submissions have been nominated for Best Foreign Language Film. So I need to check each entry in the table to see if any were actually nominated.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five rows corresponding to different years and films. Each row has details like the year (ceremony), film title used in nomination, original title, director, and result.\n\nThe key column here is \"result\". The claim's validity depends on whether all these results indicate that none were nominated or if at least one was nominated.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 1: Result is \"not nominated\".\n2. Row 2: Result is \"not nominated\".\n3. Row 3: Result is \"not nominated\".\n4. Row 4: Result is \"not nominated\".\n5. Row 5: Result is \"tbd\", which I assume stands for \"to be determined\" or not yet decided.\n\nSince the first four rows clearly state that they were not nominated, and the fifth one's result hasn't been decided yet, we can infer that up to the point of this data, none have been nominated. However, if a future submission (like row 5) is eventually nominated, then the claim would be false. But based on the current information provided in the table, all previous submissions were not nominated.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"none of the latvian submission be nominated\". So considering only past submissions, since all have resulted in \"not nominated\", the claim holds true for them. The fifth entry is pending, so it's uncertain if it will change the outcome, but as of now, none have been nominated.\n\nTherefore, according to the data given, the claim seems to hold true because all previous Latvian submissions were not nominated for Best Foreign Language Film. The relevant cells are each row's \"result\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because all entries in the table show that no Latvian submission was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film. Each result indicates \"not nominated\", supporting the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"2 of the 5 films be directed by J\u0101nis Nords.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the table structure. There are five rows, each representing a different year and film nomination. Each row has columns for Year (Ceremony), Film Title Used in Nomination, Original Title, Director, and Result.\n\nThe claim mentions that two out of the five films were directed by J\u0101nis Nords. So I need to check each director's name across all rows to see how many times J\u0101nis Nords appears.\n\nLooking at Row 1: The director is J\u0101nis Strei\u010ds.\nRow 2: Director is Aigars Grauba.\nRow 3: Director is M\u0101ris Martinsons.\nRow 4: Director is Yevgeni Pashkevich.\nRow 5: Director is J\u0101nis Nords.\n\nWait, so in the fifth row, the director is indeed J\u0101nis Nords. But looking through all five rows, only Row 5 has that name. The other four directors are different people. So that means only one film out of five was directed by J\u0101nis Nords.\n\nThe claim says two films were directed by him, but according to the table, it's just one. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to list each cell in the Director column across all rows because that's where we check who directed each film. So each row from 0 to 4 (since indexes start at 0) has a Director column entry. That means five cells in total are relevant here.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that two films were directed by J\u0101nis Nords, but the table shows only one such film.

The claim says: \"mother , i love you and gulf stream under the iceberg be submit 1 year after the other.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that these two films were submitted (or nominated) one year apart from each other. So, I should check the years they were submitted.\n\nLooking at the table, let's find both movies. \n\n- \"mother , i love you\" is listed in row 5. The year for this entry is 2013 (86th ceremony).\n- \"gulf stream under the iceberg\" is in row 4. Its year is 2012 (85th ceremony).\n\nNow, I need to see if these years are consecutive. 2012 and 2013 are indeed one year apart. So, they were submitted in consecutive years.\n\nNext, I should check the relevant cells from the table that support this conclusion. For \"mother , i love you,\" the relevant cell is the year (ceremony) column in row 5. For \"gulf stream under the iceberg,\" it's also the year (ceremony) column but in row 4.\n\nSince both films were submitted in consecutive years, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe two films were submitted in consecutive years, 2012 and 2013.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"defender of riga be submit more than a decade after the previous submission\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and identify the relevant information. The table lists film submissions with details like year (ceremony), film title used in nomination, original title, director, and result.\n\nThe claim mentions \"defender of riga,\" which I can see is present in Row 2: Year (ceremony) 2008 (81st). The film title used in nomination here is \"Defenders of Riga.\" So that's one relevant cell from Row 2, specifically the year column.\n\nNext, I need to find the previous submission before \"Defenders of Riga.\" Looking at the table:\n\n- Before 2008 (Row 2), there are earlier entries:\n  - Row 1: 1992 (65th)\n  - Then a gap until 2008.\n\nWait, but actually, in the table provided, the years listed before 2008 are only 1992. So the previous submission before 2008 would be from Row 1: 1992 (65th).\n\nNow, calculating the time between these two submissions:\n- Previous submission year: 1992\n- Next submission year for \"Defenders of Riga\": 2008\n\nThe difference is 2008 - 1992 = 16 years. A decade is 10 years, so more than a decade would be over 10 years apart.\n\nSince 16 years is indeed more than a decade, the claim holds true. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nTo summarize, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 2, Year (ceremony): 2008\n- Row 1, Year (ceremony): 1992\n\nThese two rows show that there's an interval of more than a decade between the submissions.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"}\n   ]\n}",

Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It says that five Latvian films were submitted over a period of 21 years for the Academy Award in Best Foreign Language Film. I need to check if this aligns with the data provided in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it has five rows, each representing a film submission:\n\nRow 1: Year 1992 (65th ceremony)\nRow 2: Year 2008 (81st)\nRow 3: Year 2010 (83rd)\nRow 4: Year 2012 (85th)\nRow 5: Year 2013 (86th)\n\nEach entry has details like the film title used in nomination, original title, director, and result. The claim mentions Latvian films, so I should check if all these entries are indeed from Latvia. All directors listed have Latvian-sounding names (e.g., J\u0101nis Strei\u010ds, Aigars Grauba), which suggests they're Latvian filmmakers.\n\nNow, the time span: The earliest year is 1992 and the latest is 2013. To find out how many years that spans, I subtract 1992 from 2013, which gives 21 years (since 2013 - 1992 = 21). So the time period covered by these submissions is exactly 21 years.\n\nThe claim states there are five films submitted over 21 years. The table shows five distinct entries from Latvia across those years, each submitted for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Each row's result varies, but regardless of whether they were nominated or not, their submission counts towards the total number.\n\nTherefore, the claim is accurate: there are five Latvian films submitted over a 21-year period (from 1992 to 2013) for consideration in the Academy Awards' Best Foreign Language Film category.\n</think>\n\nThe table lists five Latvian film submissions from 1992 to 2013, which is a span of 21 years.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"defender of riga be submit more than a decade before the next submission\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is saying. It seems to state that the film \"Defenders of Riga\" (I assume there's a typo with the capitalization and plural) was submitted to an award ceremony more than ten years before the next submission from the same country or category.\n\nLooking at the table, I see multiple rows representing different submissions over the years. Each row has details like year, film title used in nomination, original title, director, and result.\n\nThe claim mentions \"Defenders of Riga,\" which is listed in Row 2 with the year 2008 (81st ceremony). The next submission after 2008 would be in a later year. Let's check the subsequent rows:\n\n- Row 3: 2010 (83rd)\n- Row 4: 2012 (85th)\n- Row 5: 2013 (86th)\n\nSo, after 2008, the next submission was in 2010. The time between 2008 and 2010 is only two years, which is far less than a decade (ten years). Therefore, \"Defenders of Riga\" was not submitted more than a decade before the next submission.\n\nTo verify this, I'll look at the relevant cells in the table:\n\n- For \"Defenders of Riga,\" we need the year it was submitted: Row 2, Year (Ceremony).\n- The next submission after that would be the earliest year after 2008, which is 2010 in Row 3.\n\nCalculating the difference between these years gives us 2010 - 2008 = 2 years. Since this is less than a decade (10 years), the claim is FALSE.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 2's Year (Ceremony) to find when \"Defenders of Riga\" was submitted.\n- The next submission in Row 3's Year (Ceremony) to determine the gap between submissions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_2_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"5 latvian film in 11 year be submit for the academy award best foreign language film.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse the claim properly. It seems a bit grammatically off, but I think it's trying to say that five Latvian films were submitted over an 11-year period for consideration in the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five rows, each representing a different year and film submission. The years listed are 1992, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2013. Let me count how many entries there are: that's five films from Latvia submitted in these years.\n\nNow, the time span between the earliest year (1992) and the latest (2013) is 21 years. Wait, but the claim mentions an 11-year period. Hmm, that might be a problem because 2013 minus 1992 is more than 11 years.\n\nWait, maybe I should check each film's submission within consecutive years or something else? Let me list out the years: 1992, then there's a gap until 2008. That's 16 years between those two submissions. Then from 2008 to 2010 is two years, 2010 to 2012 is two years again, and 2012 to 2013 is one year. So the total span isn't 11 years; it's much longer.\n\nBut perhaps the claim refers to five films submitted over any 11-year period within these submissions? Let me check if there are five films within an 11-year window in the data.\n\nLooking at the submission years: 1992, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013. The earliest possible 11-year window would be from 2008 to 2019 (though our latest is 2013). Let's see how many films fall into that: 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013\u2014that's four films. Not five.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant that in an 11-year span starting from a certain point, but even then, I don't see five submissions within any consecutive 11 years based on the given data. The maximum number of submissions in any 11-year window here is four (2008-2019), which isn't five.\n\nTherefore, the claim that five Latvian films were submitted over an 11-year period doesn't hold true with the information provided in the table. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
