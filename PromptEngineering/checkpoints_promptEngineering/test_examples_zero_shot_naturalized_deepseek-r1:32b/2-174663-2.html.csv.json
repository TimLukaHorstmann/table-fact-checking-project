    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"4 of the total match play end in a draw\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the data.\n\nFirst, the claim states that four matches ended in a draw. To verify this, I'll go through each row of the table and check the 'result' column for draws. Each row represents a different match with details like date, venue, score, result, and competition.\n\nStarting from Row 1:\n- Row 1: Result is 'win', so not a draw.\n- Row 2: Result is 'win', so no.\n- Row 3: Result is 'draw'. That's the first draw. I'll note this row (Row 3).\n  \nMoving on to subsequent rows:\n- Rows 4 and 5 are both losses, so they don't count.\n- Row 6 is a win, so not a draw.\n  \nLooking at World Cup Qualifying matches in 1998:\n- Row 7: Win\n- Row 8: Win\n- Row 9: Win\n- Row 10: Win\n\nNext, checking the remaining rows for draws:\n- Row 11: Result is 'draw'. That's the second draw. Noted as Row 11.\n- Row 12: Also a 'draw', making it the third draw. This is Row 12.\n\nContinuing further:\n- Rows 13, 14, 15, and 16 are from the FIFA Confederations Cup.\n    - Row 13: Result is 'draw' (third draw).\n    - Wait, I already counted that as second or third? Let me recount.\n\nWait, earlier I thought Rows 3, 11, 12, and 13 were draws. That would be four draws in total:\n- Row 3: First draw\n- Row 11: Second draw\n- Row 12: Third draw\n- Row 13: Fourth draw\n\nWait no, because Row 14 is a loss, Rows 15 and 16 are a win and another loss. So let me list all draws:\n\n- Row 3: Draw (1)\n- Row 11: Draw (2)\n- Row 12: Draw (3)\n- Row 13: Draw (4)\n\nThat's four matches that ended in a draw, which supports the claim.\n\nNow, I need to collect the relevant cells. Each draw is found in the 'result' column of these rows. So for each row where result is 'draw', I note the row index and the column name as 'result'.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Row 3, result\n- Row 11, result\n- Row 12, result\n- Row 13, result\n\nThis confirms that there are exactly four draws in total. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"most of the match play be for world cup qualify\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that most of the matches played were for World Cup qualification. So, my task is to check how many matches in the table are related to World Cup qualifying and see if they make up the majority.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 17 rows, each representing a match with details like date, venue, score, result, and competition. The key column here is \"competition,\" as it indicates the purpose of each match.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Competition is \"1994 world cup qualifying\" \u2013 yes, this counts.\nRow 2: Same as above.\nRow 3: Also \"1994 world cup qualifying.\"\nRow 4: Competition is \"friendly\" \u2013 not a qualifier.\nRow 5: Another friendly match.\nRow 6: Friendly again.\nRow 7: \"1998 world cup qualifying\" \u2013 counts.\nRow 8: Same as row 7.\nRow 9: Same as above.\nRow 10: Also in the 1998 qualifiers.\nRow 11: Still part of 1998 World Cup qualifying.\nRow 12: Another qualifier for 1998.\nRow 13: Competition is \"1997 fifa confederations cup\" \u2013 not a World Cup qualifier.\nRow 14: Same as above.\nRow 15: Still the Confederations Cup.\nRow 16: Again, same competition.\nRow 17: Friendly match in 2000.\n\nNow, let's count how many are World Cup qualifiers. Rows 1-3 (3 matches), and rows 7-12 (6 matches) \u2013 that totals 9 matches. The other rows are either friendly or part of the Confederations Cup.\n\nSo, out of 17 total matches, 9 were for World Cup qualifying. To determine if \"most\" is accurate, I need to see if 9 is more than half. Half of 17 is 8.5, so yes, 9 is more than that. Therefore, the majority of the matches are indeed for World Cup qualification.\n\nThe relevant cells here are all the competition entries from each row. So, each row's \"competition\" column is important to assess whether it's a qualifier or not.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that most matches were for World Cup qualifying. Counting the relevant rows shows that 9 out of 17 matches were qualifiers, which constitutes a majority.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the most number of point score in a match be 13 and be a shutout",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the most number of points score in a match be 13 and be a shutout\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions two things: the highest scoring match had 13 points, and that it was a shutout. In sports like soccer, when they talk about points in a match, I think they mean goals scored, not actual points towards a league table. So, the claim is saying that the game where the most goals were scored was 13-0, which would be a shutout since one team scored all the goals without any response from the other.\n\nNow, looking at the table, there are multiple rows each representing a match with details like date, venue, score, result, and competition. I need to check each row's score to find the highest number of goals in a single match.\n\nStarting from Row 1:\n- Score: 1-0\nRow 2:\n- Score: 3-0\nRow 3:\n- Score: 1-1\nRow 4:\n- Score: 0-1 (this is a loss, but the score is 0-1)\nRow 5:\n- Score: 0-3\nRow 6:\n- Score: 1-0\nRow 7:\n- Score: 13-0\nThis looks like a high-scoring match. The total goals here are 14 (13+1), but the score is 13-0, meaning one team scored 13 and the other none. That would definitely be a shutout since only one team scored.\n\nContinuing through the rest of the rows to ensure there's no higher score:\nRow 8: 2-0\nRow 9: 3-0\nRow 10: 2-0\nRow 11: 1-1\nRow 12: 2-2\nRow 13: 0-0\nRow 14: 0-1\nRow 15: 1-0\nRow 16: 0-6\nRow 17: 3-0\n\nNone of the other rows have a score higher than 13. The highest is indeed in Row 7 with a score of 13-0.\n\nNow, checking if it was a shutout. A shutout in sports typically means one team didn't score at all while the other did. In this case, the score is 13-0, so yes, it's a shutout because one team scored 13 goals and the opponent didn't score any.\n\nSo both conditions of the claim are satisfied: the highest number of goals in a match was 13 (from Row 7), and that game was a shutout as well. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the highest-scoring match had 13 goals with one team winning 13-0, which is confirmed by the data in Row 7.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"most of the match play be during the year 1997\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table and check the date to see which year it falls under. The claim is about most matches being played in 1997, so I need to count how many rows have a date in that year.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: 30 May 1993 \u2192 1993\n- Row 2: 6 June 1993 \u2192 1993\n- Row 3: 31 October 1993 \u2192 1993\n- Row 4: 27 March 1996 \u2192 1996\n- Row 5: 24 April 1996 \u2192 1996\n- Row 6: 12 March 1997 \u2192 1997\n- Row 7: 11 June 1997 \u2192 1997\n- Row 8: 19 June 1997 \u2192 1997\n- Row 9: 28 June 1997 \u2192 1997\n- Row 10: 6 July 1997 \u2192 1997\n- Row 11: 22 November 1997 \u2192 1997\n- Row 12: 29 November 1997 \u2192 1997\n- Row 13: 14 December 1997 \u2192 1997\n- Row 14: 16 December 1997 \u2192 1997\n- Row 15: 19 December 1997 \u2192 1997\n- Row 16: 21 December 1997 \u2192 1997\n- Row 17: 23 February 2000 \u2192 2000\n\nNow, let's count the number of matches in each year:\n\n- 1993: Rows 1, 2, 3 \u2192 3 matches\n- 1996: Rows 4,5 \u2192 2 matches\n- 1997: Rows 6 to 16 (inclusive) \u2192 let's count these. From row 6 to row 16 is 11 rows. So that's 11 matches.\n- 2000: Row 17 \u2192 1 match\n\nAdding them up, total matches: 3 + 2 + 11 + 1 = 17.\n\nNow, the claim says \"most\" of the matches were in 1997. Since 11 out of 17 is more than half (which would be over 8.5), so yes, most are in 1997.\n\nTo confirm, I'll list the relevant cells which have dates in 1997:\n\nRows 6 to 16 all have dates in 1997.

I need to determine whether the claim \"only 1 game have a total of zero point score end in a draw\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It states that only one game ended with a total score of zero points and resulted in a draw. So, I'm looking for matches where both teams scored zero goals (0-0) and the result was a draw.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. Row 3: Date 31 October 1993, Score 1-1, Result Draw. Total score is 2 points, not zero.\n2. Row 14: Date 16 December 1997, Score 0-1, Result Loss. Not a draw.\n3. Row 15: Date 19 December 1997, Score 1-0, Result Win. Not a draw.\n4. The other rows either have non-zero scores or different results.\n\nWait, I might have missed something. Let me go through each row carefully:\n\nRow 1: 1-0 win\nRow 2: 3-0 win\nRow 3: 1-1 draw (total 2 points)\nRow 4: 0-1 loss\nRow 5: 0-3 loss\nRow 6: 1-0 win\nRow 7: 13-0 win\nRow 8: 2-0 win\nRow 9: 3-0 win\nRow 10: 2-0 win\nRow 11: 1-1 draw (total 2 points)\nRow 12: 2-2 draw (total 4 points)\nRow 13: 0-0 draw (total 0 points) - this is the one game that fits.\nRow 14: 0-1 loss\nRow 15: 1-0 win\nRow 16: 0-6 loss\nRow 17: 3-0 win\n\nSo, only Row 13 has a score of 0-0 and the result is a draw.

So, the task is to determine whether the claim \"5 of the total match end in a draw\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is stating. It says that five matches ended in a draw according to the data provided in the table. To verify this, I should go through each row of the table and count how many times the result was a draw.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 17 rows, each representing a different match. Each row has columns: date, venue, score, result, and competition. The key column for our claim is the \"result\" column because it indicates whether a match ended in a win, loss, or draw.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Row 1: Result is \"win\" \u2192 Not a draw.\n2. Row 2: Result is \"win\" \u2192 Not a draw.\n3. Row 3: Result is \"draw\" \u2192 This counts as a draw. So, count = 1.\n4. Row 4: Result is \"loss\" \u2192 Not a draw.\n5. Row 5: Result is \"loss\" \u2192 Not a draw.\n6. Row 6: Result is \"win\" \u2192 Not a draw.\n7. Row 7: Result is \"win\" \u2192 Not a draw.\n8.

Row 17: Result is \"win\" \u2192 Not a draw.\n\nAfter reviewing all rows, I found that the matches in rows 3, 11, 12, and 13 ended in draws. That's four draws in total. The claim states there are five such matches, which doesn't align with what I've counted.\n\nSo, the relevant cells for this verification are those where the result is \"draw\". These correspond to rows 3, 11, 12, and 13, each having the \"result\" column indicating a draw.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"very few of the match play be for world cup qualify\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim means. It says that very few matches were played for World Cup qualification. So, I should check how many matches in the table are related to World Cup qualifying competitions.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 17 rows. Each row has a \"competition\" column which indicates whether it's part of the World Cup qualifiers or another type of match like friendly games or the Confederations Cup.\n\nI'll go through each row and note the competition:\n\nRow 1: 1994 World Cup qualifying\nRow 2: 1994 World Cup qualifying\nRow 3: 1994 World Cup qualifying\nRow 4: Friendly\nRow 5: Friendly\nRow 6: Friendly\nRow 7: 1998 World Cup qualifying\nRow 8: 1998 World Cup qualifying\nRow 9: 1998 World Cup qualifying\nRow 10: 1998 World Cup qualifying\nRow 11: 1998 World Cup qualifying\nRow 12: 1998 World Cup qualifying\nRow 13: 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup\nRow 14: 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup\nRow 15: 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup\nRow 16: 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup\nRow 17: Friendly\n\nNow, let's count the number of World Cup qualifying matches. Rows 1-3 are for the 1994 qualifiers, and rows 7-12 are for the 1998 qualifiers. That makes a total of 6 + 6 = 12 matches? Wait, no: rows 1-3 is 3 matches, and rows 7-12 is 6 matches (since row 7 to row 10 is 4, but I might have miscounted). Let me recount:\n\nRows 1-3: 3 matches\nRows 7-12: That's 6 rows. Wait, actually, from row 7 to row 12 inclusive, that's 6 rows (rows 7,8,9,10,11,12). So that's 6 more matches.\n\nSo total World Cup qualifiers are 3 + 6 = 9 matches.\n\nTotal number of matches in the table is 17. So 9 out of 17 are World Cup qualifying.\n\nNow, the claim says \"very few\" were for World Cup qualify. But 9 isn't a very few when considering the total of 17; it's almost half. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because a significant number of matches are for World Cup qualifiers.\n\nThe relevant cells would be all rows where competition is either 1994 or 1998 World Cup qualifying. So that includes rows 1-3 and 7-12. Each of these rows has the \"competition\" column indicating World Cup qualify, so their relevant_ cells are each row's competition entry.\n\nSo in total, there are 3 + 6 = 9 rows related to World Cup qualifiers, which is a substantial portion, not very few.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the most number of point score in a match be 3 and it be a draw",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the most number of points scored in a match be 3 and it be a draw\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like there are two parts:\n\n1. The highest (most) number of points scored in any single match was 3.\n2. That particular match ended as a draw.\n\nSo, my task is to check if there's a match where the total score is 3 and it was a draw. Also, I have to ensure that no other match has a higher total score than 3.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match with details like date, venue, score, result, and competition. The 'score' column shows the goals scored by each team in that match. For example, Row 1 has a score of 1-0, meaning one team scored 1 goal and the other 0.\n\nLet me go through each row to find any matches where the total points (sum of both teams' goals) is 3, and the result was a draw.\n\nStarting with Row 1: Score is 1-0. Total points = 1+0=1. Result is a win. Not relevant for our claim since it's not a draw and the total isn't 3.\n\nRow 2: Score 3-0. Total points = 3. Result is a win. Again, not a draw.\n\nRow 3: Score 1-1. Total points=2. It was a draw, but total isn't 3. So close, but doesn't meet the claim's criteria.\n\nRow 4: Score 0-1. Total=1. Loss result. Not relevant.\n\nRow 5: Score 0-3. Total=3. Result is a loss. The total is 3, but it's not a draw, so this doesn't fit the claim either.\n\nRow 6: Score 1-0. Total=1. Win result. Doesn't help.\n\nRow 7: Score 13-0. Wait, that's a huge score! Total points here are 13+0=13. This is way higher than 3 and the result was a win. So this already breaks the first part of the claim because 13 is more than 3.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check all rows.\n\nRow 8: Score 2-0. Total=2. Win.\n\nRow 9: Score 3-0. Total=3. Win.\n\nRow 10: Score 2-0. Total=2. Win.\n\nRow 11: Score 1-1. Total=2. Draw, but total isn't 3.\n\nRow 12: Score 2-2. Total=4. It's a draw, but the total is higher than 3 (it's 4). So this also doesn't fit because it's a higher score than what the claim states as the maximum.\n\nRows 13 to 16 are part of the FIFA Confederations Cup. Their scores are 0-0 (total=0), 0-1, 1-0, and 0-6. None have totals around 3 except Row 12 which we already considered.\n\nRow 17: Score 3-0. Total=3, but result is a win.\n\nWait, in the initial analysis, I saw that Row 7 has a score of 13-0, making the total points 13, which is way more than 3. So the highest score isn't 3 as the claim says\u2014it's actually higher. Therefore, the first part of the claim is false.\n\nAdditionally, even if we ignore Row 7, looking for any match with a total of 3 that was a draw: The only matches with total points near 3 are Rows 5 (0-3, loss) and Row 9 (3-0, win). There's no match in the table where the total is exactly 3 and it's a draw. \n\nRow 12 has a total of 4, which is higher than 3 and was a draw, but that doesn't fit the claim either because the claim specifies the maximum as 3.\n\nSo putting this together:\n\n- The highest score in any match is 13 (from Row 7), so the first part of the claim (\"most number of points scored in a match be 3\") is false.\n- Even if that weren't the case, there's no match where both conditions are met: total points = 3 and result is a draw.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cells would include any row where the score sums to more than 3 or shows a draw with a different total. Since Row 7 has the highest score but isn't a draw, it's important in disproving the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"almost none of the match play be during the year 1997\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim is saying. It mentions that almost none of the matches were played in 1997. So, I need to check how many matches occurred in that year and see if it aligns with the claim.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like date, venue, score, result, and competition. The key information here is the \"date\" column because it tells me when each match took place. \n\nI'll go through each row and note down the year of each match:\n\n1. Row 1: 30 May 1993 \u2013 that's in 1993.\n2. Row 2: 6 June 1993 \u2013 also 1993.\n3. Row 3: 31 October 1993 \u2013 again, 1993.\n4. Row 4: 27 March 1996 \u2013 1996.\n5. Row 5: 24 April 1996 \u2013 still 1996.\n6. Row 6: 12 March 1997 \u2013 this is the first match in 1997.\n7. Row 7: 11 June 1997 \u2013 another 1997 match.\n8. Row 8: 19 June 1997 \u2013 also 1997.\n9. Row 9: 28 June 1997 \u2013 still in '97.\n10. Row 10: 6 July 1997 \u2013 another one in '97.\n11. Row 11: 22 November 1997 \u2013 again, '97.\n12. Row 12: 29 November 1997 \u2013 still '97.\n13. Row 13: 14 December 1997 \u2013 in '97.\n14. Row 14: 16 December 1997 \u2013 also '97.\n15. Row 15: 19 December 1997 \u2013 still '97.\n16. Row 16: 21 December 1997 \u2013 another in '97.\n17. Row 17: 23 February 2000 \u2013 that's in 2000.\n\nNow, counting the matches in 1997: starting from row 6 up to row 16. That's rows 6-16 inclusive. Let me count them:\n\nRow 6: Yes\nRow 7: Yes\nRow 8: Yes\nRow 9: Yes\nRow 10: Yes\nRow 11: Yes\nRow 12: Yes\nRow 13: Yes\nRow 14: Yes\nRow 15: Yes\nRow 16: Yes\n\nThat's 11 matches in total for 1997. The other rows are from 1993, 1996, and 2000.\n\nSo, the claim says \"almost none\" of the matches were played in '97. But looking at the data, over half of the listed matches (rows) occurred in 1997. There are a total of 17 rows, with 11 in '97. That's a significant number, not almost none.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there were multiple matches played in 1997, contrary to what the claim suggests.\n\nThe relevant cells here are all the dates in the \"date\" column where the year is 1997. Each of these rows contributes to assessing whether 'almost none' is accurate or not.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"3 games have a total of zero points score end in a draw\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It states that there are three games where the total points scored (i.e., both teams combined) was zero, and each of these games ended in a draw. So I need to look through the table for any rows where the score is 0-0 because that's the only way the total points can be zero.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple rows, so I'll go through them one by one:\n\n1. Row 1: Score is 1-0. Total points = 1+0=1 \u2192 Not zero.\n2. Row 2: Score is 3-0. Total points = 3+0=3 \u2192 Not zero.\n3. Row 3: Score is 1-1. Total points = 1+1=2 \u2192 Not zero.\n4. Row 4: Score is 0-1. Total points = 0+1=1 \u2192 Not zero, but it's a loss anyway.\n5. Row 5: Score is 0-3. Total points = 0+3=3 \u2192 Not zero, and also a loss.\n6. Row 6: Score is 1-0. Total points =1\u2192 Not zero.\n7. Row 7: Score is 13-0. That's 13 points, definitely not zero.\n8. Row 8: 2-0 \u2192 2 points total.\n9. Row 9: 3-0 \u2192 3 points.\n10. Row 10: 2-0 \u2192 2 points.\n11. Row 11: 1-1 \u2192 2 points.\n12. Row 12: 2-2 \u2192 4 points.\n13. Row 13: Score is 0-0. Total points = 0+0=0. Result is a draw. So this counts as one game meeting the claim's criteria.\n14. Row 14: 0-1 \u2192 Total points 1, and it's a loss. Not relevant.\n15. Row 15: 1-0 \u2192 Total points 1, result is a win. Doesn't fit.\n16. Row 16: 0-6 \u2192 Total points 6, and a loss.\n17. Row 17: 3-0 \u2192 3 points.\n\nLooking through all the rows, only Row 13 has a score of 0-0 and resulted in a draw. That's just one game, not three as claimed. The other rows either don't have a total of zero or didn't end in a draw.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's only one such game instead of three.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that three games ended with a 0-0 score and resulted in a draw. However, examining each row reveals that only Row 13 meets these criteria, not three. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
