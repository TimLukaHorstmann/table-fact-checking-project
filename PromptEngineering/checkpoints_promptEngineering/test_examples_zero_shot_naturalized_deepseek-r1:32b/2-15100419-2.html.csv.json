    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"there be no defensive end pick and an overall smaller than 2\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table provided. Each row has information about a player including their position, round, pick number, overall pick, name, etc. My task is to check two conditions: whether there are any defensive end picks and whether all those picks have an overall number smaller than 2.\n\nWait, actually, the claim says \"there be no defensive end pick and an overall smaller than 2.\" That seems a bit confusingly phrased. I think it might mean that there are no defensive ends picked with an overall pick number less than 2. Alternatively, perhaps it's saying that among the picks with an overall number less than 2, none are defensive ends.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first row (Row 1) is Kevin Hardy, a linebacker from Illinois. Round 1, pick 2, overall 2.\n- Row 2: Tony Brackens, defensive end, Texas. Round 2, pick 3, overall 33.\n- The rest of the rows have overall picks higher than that.\n\nWait, so in the entire table, only Row 2 is a defensive end. His overall pick number is 33, which is way higher than 2. So looking at the claim again: \"there be no defensive end pick and an overall smaller than 2.\" I think this means checking if any defensive ends were picked with an overall number less than 2.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- The only defensive end is Tony Brackens in Row 2, who has an overall pick of 33. That's not smaller than 2.\n- All other rows have positions that are not defensive end.\n\nSo checking for any row where position is \"defensive end\" and overall < 2. Since there's no such row, the claim is TRUE because there are no defensive ends with an overall pick less than 2.\n\nWait a second, but the first row has an overall of 2. The claim says \"smaller than 2\", which would exclude 2. So even if someone had overall 2, it wouldn't count since it's not smaller. But in this case, there are no defensive ends with overall less than 2.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are Row 2 (since that's the only defensive end) and checking its overall pick number.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the only defensive end has an overall pick of 33, which is not smaller than 2. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
