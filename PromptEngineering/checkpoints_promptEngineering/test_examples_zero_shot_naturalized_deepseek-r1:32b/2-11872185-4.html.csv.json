    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"no lifetime india distributor share be give earlier than 2009\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's asserting that there are no movies with a lifetime India distributor share before the year 2009. In other words, all the entries in the table have their \"year\" as 2009 or later. So, if any movie in the table has a year earlier than 2009, then the claim is false.\n\nLooking at the table, each row lists a movie with its rank, name, year, studio(s), and lifetime India distributor share. I need to check all the years listed here.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. Row 1: Movie \"Chennai Express\" from 2013.\n2. Row 2: \"Ek Tha Tiger\" released in 2012.\n3. Row 3: \"3 Idiots\" came out in 2009.\n4. Row 4: \"Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani\" is from 2013.\n5. Row 5: \"Dabangg 2\" was released in 2012.\n6. Row 6: \"Bodyguard\" came out in 2011.\n7. Row 7: The original \"Dabangg\" was in 2010.\n8. Row 8: \"Rowdy Rathore\" is from 2012.\n9. Row 9: \"Agneepath\" released in 2012.\n10. Row 10: \"Ready\" came out in 2011.\n\nNow, checking each year against the claim:\n\n- The earliest year listed is 2009 (Row 3). So, all movies are from 2009 or later.\n\nWait a minute, does that mean there's no movie before 2009? Yes, looking at all rows, the oldest one is 2009. Therefore, there's no entry with a year earlier than that.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim holds true because none of the movies have a release date prior to 2009.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that no lifetime India distributor share was given before 2009. Checking each movie's release year confirms all are from 2009 or later. Thus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine if the claim \"lifetime india share earlier than 2009 be 0\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. It says that for movies released before 2009 (i.e., with a year less than 2009), their lifetime India distributor share should be zero.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a movie with details including its rank, title, release year, studio(s), and lifetime India distributor share. My task is to check all movies whose release year is earlier than 2009 and verify if their corresponding lifetime India distributor shares are zero.\n\nLet's go through each row one by one:\n\n- **Row 1:** Movie: Chennai Express, Year: 2013 \u2192 This is after 2009, so it doesn't apply.\n- **Row 2:** Movie: Ek Tha Tiger, Year: 2012 \u2192 Also after 2009.\n- **Row 3:** Movie: 3 Idiots, Year: 2009 \u2192 The year is exactly 2009. The claim specifies \"earlier than 2009,\" so this doesn't fall under the condition either. However, just to be thorough, its share is 99,02, which is not zero.\n- **Row 4:** Movie: Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, Year: 2013 \u2192 Again, after 2009.\n- **Row 5:** Movie: Dabangg 2, Year: 2012 \u2192 Post-2009.\n- **Row 6:** Movie: Bodyguard, Year: 2011 \u2192 After 2009.\n- **Row 7:** Movie: Dabangg, Year: 2010 \u2192 Still after 2009.\n- **Row 8:** Movie: Rowdy Rathore, Year: 2012 \u2192 Post-2009.\n- **Row 9:** Movie: Agneepath, Year: 2012 \u2192 After 2009.\n- **Row 10:** Movie: Ready, Year: 2011 \u2192 Also after 2009.\n\nFrom the table, I notice that all movies have a release year of 2009 or later. There are no entries where the year is before 2009. Since there's no data for movies released earlier than 2009, we can't confirm whether their lifetime India shares were zero because they simply don't exist in this dataset.\n\nHowever, the claim states that \"lifetime india share earlier than 2009 be 0.\" If we interpret this as saying all movies before 2009 have a share of zero, but since there are no such movies in our table, does it mean the claim is automatically TRUE? Or because we can't verify it due to lack of data, should it be FALSE?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The instruction says if the claim is fully supported by the table, answer TRUE; otherwise, FALSE. Since there are no movies before 2009 in the table, the condition doesn't apply, and thus we can't confirm that all earlier movies have zero shares. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported because it's making a statement about data not present in the table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is TRUE by default because there are no counterexamples (movies before 2009 with non-zero shares) since they don't exist. But typically, in such contexts, if the claim makes a universal statement (\"all X have Y\") and there's no data to support or refute it, it's safer to say the claim isn't supported because we can't verify it.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps I should consider that for all entries where the year is before 2009, their share must be zero. Since none of the entries have a year before 2009, does this mean the condition holds vacuously? In logic, if there are no cases where P(x) is true (here, x has year <2009), then the statement \"for all x, if P(x) then Q(x)\" is trivially true because there's no counterexample. \n\nBut I'm not sure about this approach since in real-world data analysis, we often require actual data to support claims. So, perhaps it's better to treat the claim as not being supported by the given data because there are no movies before 2009 to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all the movies in the table released after or in 2009 have non-zero shares, which might suggest that any movie before would also need to be zero. But this is a stretch and beyond what's provided.\n\nIn conclusion, since there are no movies in the table with a release year earlier than 2009, we can't confirm whether their lifetime India shares are zero or not. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the data available.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be confirmed as TRUE because there is no data for movies released before 2009 in the table to verify if their shares were zero.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"in 2009 ek tha tiger be first release\" is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It says that in 2009, \"ek tha tiger\" was the first release. So I need to check two things: when was \"ek tha tiger\" released, and what was its rank or position in 2009.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has information about a movie's rank, name, year, studio, and distributor share. The claim is about the year 2009, so I'll look for rows where the year is 2009.\n\nIn the table, Row 3 corresponds to \"3 idiots\" released in 2009. Its rank is 1. Now, the claim mentions \"ek tha tiger,\" which is listed in Row 2 with a release year of 2012 and rank 2. \n\nWait, that's conflicting because if \"ek tha tiger\" was released in 2012, it can't be the first release in 2009. The first release in 2009 according to the table is \"3 idiots.\" Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are Row 2 (for \"ek tha tiger\") and Row 3 (for \"3 idiots\"). The columns needed are 'movie' and 'year' for both rows. Additionally, looking at the rank helps determine the position in that year.\n\nI think I've covered all necessary points. The claim is false because \"ek tha tiger\" was released later than stated and wasn't the first release in 2009.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"ek tha tiger\" was the first release in 2009, but according to the table, it was actually released in 2012.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"agneepath be release first in 2010\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that the movie \"agneepath\" was released first in 2010. So, I'm looking for information about when \"agneepath\" was actually released according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row contains details about different movies, including their release years. The claim is about \"agneepath,\" so my focus should be on finding that specific movie in the table and checking its release year.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one until I find \"agneepath.\" \n\n- Row 1: Movie is \"chennai express\" released in 2013.\n- Row 2: \"ek tha tiger\" from 2012.\n- Row 3: \"3 idiots\" in 2009.\n- Row 4: \"yeh jawaani hai deewani\" in 2013.\n- Row 5: \"dabangg 2\" released in 2012.\n- Row 6: \"bodyguard\" from 2011.\n- Row 7: \"dabangg\" in 2010.
