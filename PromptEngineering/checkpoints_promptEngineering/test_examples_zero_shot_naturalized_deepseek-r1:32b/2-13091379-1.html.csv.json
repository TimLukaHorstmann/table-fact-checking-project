    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the engine alfa romeo 3.0 v8 ford cosworth dfv have f tyre\". \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It's stating that a specific engine model, which combines both \"alfa romeo 3.0 v8\" and \"ford cosworth dfv\", uses \"f\" tyres.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to check if any of them have this combination. \n\nRow 1: Year 1970, engine is Ford Cosworth DFV, tyres are F. So here, the engine is only Ford Cosworth DFV, not the Alfa Romeo one. So that doesn't match.\n\nRow 2: Year 1971, engines listed are both Alfa Romeo 3.0 V8 and Ford Cosworth DFV. Tyres are F. Hmm, this seems promising because it has both engine types. The tyres here are F as per the claim. So this row supports the claim.\n\nI'll check other rows just to be thorough. Rows 3 to 14 have engines either as Ford Cosworth DFV or Judd V8 or Ilmor V10, but not the combination of Alfa Romeo and Ford Cosworth. The tyres in these later rows are G, except for row 9 and 10 where they're M A and A P respectively.\n\nSo only Row 2 matches both the engine types mentioned and has F tyres. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the march 741 chassis have f tyre and 6 point\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row that mentions the March 741 chassis. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 5: Year 1974, Chassis march 741. This seems relevant because it directly mentions the chassis in question.\n  \nLooking at Row 5's details:\n- Engine(s): Ford Cosworth DFV\n- Tyres: G\n- Points: 6\n\nThe claim says that the March 741 has 'f' tyre, but according to this row, the tyres are listed as 'G'. So there's a discrepancy here. The points mentioned in the claim are correct\u20146 points\u2014but the tyre type is not matching.\n\nI should check if any other rows mention the March 741 chassis. Looking further:\n- Row 6: Chassis march 751 and march 741. Here, the tyres are still 'G' as well. So this doesn't help either.\n\nSince only Row 5 is relevant for the March 741 chassis, and it shows that the tyres are 'G' not 'F', the claim about the tyre type is incorrect. Therefore, the overall claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the March 741 chassis has an 'f' tyre and 6 points. Checking Row 5, we find the March 741 does have 6 points but uses 'G' tyres instead of 'F'. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
