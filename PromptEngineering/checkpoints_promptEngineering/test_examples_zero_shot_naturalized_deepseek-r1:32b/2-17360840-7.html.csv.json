    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the game against opponent buffalo sabres have an attendance of 10750\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is saying. It mentions a specific opponent, the Buffalo Sabres, and it's claiming that the attendance for that game was 10,750 people. My task is to check if this information matches the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different game with various details like game number, date, opponent, score, location, attendance, record, and points. So, I need to find the row where the opponent is the Buffalo Sabres and then see what the attendance was for that game.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- **Row 1:** Opponent is Washington Capitals. Not the Sabres.\n- **Row 2:** Carolina Hurricanes. Nope.\n- **Row 3:** Atlanta Thrashers. No match.\n- **Row 4:** Phoenix Coyotes. Still not.\n- **Row 5:** Anaheim Ducks. No.\n- **Row 6:** Los Angeles Kings. No.\n- **Row 7:** San Jose Sharks. Not matching.\n- **Row 8:** Philadelphia Flyers. No.\n- **Row 9:** Florida Panthers. Nope.\n- **Row 10:** Dallas Stars. Still not the Sabres.\n- **Row 11:** Buffalo Sabres! Here we go. This is the row where they played against the Buffalo Sabres.\n\nNow, looking at Row 11, let's check the attendance column. The attendance is listed as 15,611. So, according to this row, when they played against the Buffalo Sabres on January 21, the attendance was 15,611 people.\n\nThe claim says the attendance was 10,750. Comparing that to what's in Row 11, it's clear that 10,750 doesn't match 15,611. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nTo make sure I didn't miss any other rows with Buffalo Sabres as opponents, I'll scan through the remaining rows just in case there was another game against them:\n\n- **Row 12:** Montreal Canadiens.\n- **Row 13:** Carolina Hurricanes again.\n- **Row 14:** Philadelphia Flyers.\n\nNo other games against the Buffalo Sabres are listed beyond Row 11. So, it's safe to conclude that the only game against the Sabres in this table had an attendance of 15,611, not 10,750.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the game against the Buffalo Sabres had an attendance of 10,750. Checking the table, the relevant row (Row 11) shows the attendance as 15,611, which contradicts the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
