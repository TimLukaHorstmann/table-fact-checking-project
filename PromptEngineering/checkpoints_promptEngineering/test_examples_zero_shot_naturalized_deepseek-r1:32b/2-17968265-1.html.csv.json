The claim states: \"In the 1987-88 season, Newell's Old Boy scored 55 points.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for the row corresponding to Newell's Old Boys in the table. Scanning through each row:\n\nRow 2: team is Newell's Old Boys.\n\nNow, I need to check the points they scored in the 1987-88 season. The columns in the table include 'average', 'points', 'played', and then specific seasons like '1986 - 87', '1987 - 88', etc. \n\nLooking at Row 2, under '1987 - 88' column, it shows 55 points. So the claim is correct because Newell's Old Boys indeed scored 55 points in that season.\n\nThe relevant cell here is row index 1 (since rows are zero-indexed) and the column name '1987 - 88'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 1,\n       \"column_name\": \"1987 - 88\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"114 be play when point be 107 and when 1987-88 be 31\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It seems like it's stating that a team with 107 points played 114 games in the season where they had 31 points during the 1987-88 season. So, I'm looking for a row in the table where 'points' is 107 and 'played' is 114, while also having '1987 - 88' as 31.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a team with various statistics. The columns are: team, played, points, average, 1986-87, 1987-88, 1988-89.\n\nI'll go through each row to check if any satisfy both conditions: points = 107 and played = 114, while also having '1987 - 88' equal to 31.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\nRow 0: team Ferro Carril Oeste has points 107. Let's check if played is 114? Yes, under 'played', it's 114. Now, looking at '1987 - 88' for this row, the value is 33. The claim requires it to be 31, so this doesn't match.\n\nRow 1: Next team is Deportivo Mandiy\u00fa with points 33 and played 38. Not relevant here.\n\nContinuing down, I notice that most teams have either lower or higher points than 107 except for Ferro Carril Oeste in row 0. Other rows like Platense (row 16) has 98 points, which is less than 107. Instituto de C\u00f3rdoba and Racing de C\u00f3rdoba both have 97 points. Deportivo Armenio has only 59 points.\n\nWait a minute, I just realized that Ferro Carril Oeste (row 0) is the only team with 107 points. Let me double-check:\n\n- Points: 107 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Played: 114 \u2714\ufe0f\n- 1987-88: 33 \u274c\n\nSo, it's close but not exactly matching because 1987-88 is 33 instead of 31.\n\nAre there any other rows with points = 107? No. So the only row that meets the first two conditions (points=107 and played=114) doesn't satisfy the third condition (1987-88=31). Therefore, there's no team in the table that has exactly these three values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread another row. Let me check each row again quickly:\n\nRow 0: points 107, played 114, 1987-88 33\nRow 1: points 33, played 38 \u2192 no\n...\nRow 15: Platense has 98 points, which is less than 107. \nRow 16: Instituto de C\u00f3rdoba has 97 points.\nRow 17: Racing de C\u00f3rdoba also 97.\nRow 18: San Mart\u00edn de Tucum\u00e1n 32 points.\nRow 19: Deportivo Armenio 59 points.\n\nSo, only row 0 meets points=107 and played=114. But it doesn't meet the 1987-88=31 condition. Therefore, the claim is not supported by any data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim requires a team with 107 points, 114 games played, and 31 points in 1987-88. The only row meeting points and games played doesn't have 31 in 1987-88.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"1987 - 88\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
