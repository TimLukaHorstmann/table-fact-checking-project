    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the winner of the miyagi tv cup donlop lady open end 2 point under par ( -2 )\".\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It mentions a specific tournament called the Miyagi TV Cup Dunlop Lady Open and claims that the winner finished at -2 to par.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different tournament win. I need to find the rows where the tournament is \"miyagi tv cup dunlop ladies open\". \n\nScanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Tournament is \"miyagi tv cup dunlop ladies open (as an amateur)\". The winning score's to par is -5.\n- Row 13: Tournament is \"miyagi tv cup dunlop ladies open\". The to par here is -2.\n\nSo, there are two entries for this tournament. In the first occurrence (Row 1), the to par was -5. In the second occurrence (Row 13), it's -2. \n\nThe claim refers to a single event where the winner ended at -2. Since Row 13 matches the tournament and the to par of -2, the claim is accurate based on that row.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cell is in Row 13 under \"to par\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the win score of the vernal ladies tournament be 203\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table provided. The table has multiple rows, each representing a different tournament with various details like date, tournament name, winning score, etc.\n\nThe claim mentions \"vernal ladies tournament.\" Looking at the 'tournament' column in the table, I need to find if there's an entry that exactly matches this name. Scanning through each row:\n\nRow 1: Miyagi TV Cup Dunlop Ladies Open (as an amateur)\nRow 2: Daikin Orchid Ladies\nRow 3: Suntory Ladies Open\nRow 4: Apita Circle K Sunkus Ladies\nRow 5: Masters GC Ladies\nRow 6: Daio Paper Elleair Ladies Open\nRow 7: Vernal Ladies\nRow 8: Chukyo TV Bridgestone Ladies Open\nRow 9: New Catapillar Mitsubishi Ladies\nRow 10: Japan Women's Open Golf Championship\nRow 11: Daio Paper Elleair Ladies Open (note the date is different from Row 6)\nRow 12: JLPGA Championship Konica Minolta Cup\nRow 13: Miyagi TV Cup Dunlop Ladies Open\n\nAh, I see that in Row 7, the tournament is \"vernal ladies.\" That's a match. So now, I need to check what the winning score was for this tournament.\n\nLooking at Row 7, under 'winning score,' it says 69 + 64 + 70 = 203. The claim states that the win score is 203, which matches exactly with what's in the table.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are from Row 7: 'tournament' to confirm the name and 'winning score' to verify the score. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the claim is TRUE because both the tournament name and the winning score match the information provided in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the winning score for the Vernal Ladies tournament was 203. Checking Row 7 of the table confirms this detail.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"winning score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the winner of the miyagi tv cup dunlop ladies open have a 3-stroke margin of victory.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the table to find entries where the tournament is \"miyagi tv cup dunlop ladies open.\" Let's go through the rows one by one.\n\nRow 1: Tournament is \"miyagi tv cup dunlop ladies open (as an amateur)\". The margin of victory here is listed as 1 stroke. So, that's different from the claim which says 3 strokes.\n\nRow 14: This row also mentions the same tournament, \"miyagi tv cup dunlop ladies open.\" Checking the margin of victory here, it's 3 strokes. This matches the claim.\n\nSo, there are two rows with this tournament. The first occurrence (row 1) has a 1-stroke victory, and the second (row 14) has a 3-stroke victory. However, the claim doesn't specify which instance of the tournament it's referring to. But since at least one instance meets the 3-stroke margin, does that make the claim TRUE?\n\nWait, the way the claim is phrased might be about all instances or just any instance. If the claim is stating that the winner had a 3-stroke victory in this tournament, then it's accurate for row 14 but not for row 1. But since the claim doesn't specify a particular date or year, I think it's referring to whether there exists an instance where the margin was 3 strokes.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because row 14 shows that in one of the tournaments, the winner had a 3-stroke victory.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row 14 (row index 13) for \"tournament\" which matches.\n- Row 14 for \"margin of victory\" showing 3 strokes.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says: \"the win score of the vernal ladies tournament be set in sept 2006 at 203\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part of this claim and check it against the table provided.\n\nBreaking down the claim:\n1. Tournament name: Vernal Ladies\n2. Date: September 2006\n3. Winning score: 203\n\nNow, looking through the table rows:\n\n- Row 7 is about the Vernal Ladies tournament on 15 May 2005 with a winning score of 203.\n- Other rows include tournaments in 2006, but let me check them:\n   - Row 12: 10 Sep 2006, JLPGA Championship, score 282\n   - Row 13: 24 Sep 2006, Miyagi TV Cup, score 214\n\nSo the Vernal Ladies tournament mentioned in the claim is actually in May 2005, not September 2006. The winning score there was indeed 203, but that's for a different date and year.\n\nAdditionally, looking at Row 13, which is in Sept 2006, it's a Miyagi TV Cup tournament with a different winning score (214). There's no Vernal Ladies tournament listed in September 2006. \n\nTherefore, the claim incorrectly states that the Vernal Ladies tournament was held in September 2006 and had a winning score of 203. The actual data shows it occurred earlier in 2005.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because while there is a Vernal Ladies tournament with a winning score of 203, it took place in May 2005, not September 2006.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"winning score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
