    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"only 1 of the song from the remix dead guy remix be not in 2003\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. The claim states that only one song with the remix \"dead guys remix\" (I assume it's a typo and should be \"dead guy remix\") is not from the year 2003. So, my task is to check how many songs have the remix \"dead guys remix\" and are not released in 2003.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: Year 2003, Remix: dead guys remix.\n- Row 2: Year 2003, Remix: dead guys remix.\n- Row 3: Year 2003, Remix: dead guys remix.\n- Row 4: Year 2005, Remix: dead guys remix. This is the one not in 2003.\n- Rows 5 and 6 have a different remix (\"dee - lux remix\"), so they don't count.\n\nSo, from the table, there's only one song (Row 4) with the remix \"dead guys remix\" that isn't from 2003. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because exactly one such song exists outside of 2003.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\n- For each row where Remix is \"dead guys remix,\" I need to check the Year.\n- Rows 1, 2, 3, and 4 are relevant for their Year and Remix columns.\n\nThus, the relevant cells include all these rows' Year and Remix columns.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. The claim is: \"the year 2005 be the only ear that do not have multiple song.\" Hmm, I think they meant \"year\" instead of \"ear,\" so it's about whether 2005 is the only year with just one song.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\n- Row 1 (2003): blondie, good boys\n- Row 2 (2003): chicane, locking down\n- Row 3 (2003): lamb, wonder\n- Row 4 (2005): texas, can't resist\n- Row 5 (2010): pixie lott, turn it up\n- Row 6 (2010): perry mystique, party like ur 18 feat sway\n\nSo, for each year:\n\n- 2003: three songs (rows 1-3)\n- 2005: one song (row 4)\n- 2010: two songs (rows 5-6)\n\nThe claim says that 2005 is the only year without multiple songs. But wait, looking at the data, both 2003 and 2010 have multiple songs\u2014three and two respectively. So 2005 isn't unique in having just one song; it's actually the only year with exactly one song. Wait no, that's not right because the claim says \"only ear that do not have multiple,\" which means 2005 should be the only year where there's only one song.\n\nBut according to the data:\n\n- 2003 has three songs\n- 2005 has one song\n- 2010 has two songs\n\nSo, yes, 2005 is the only year with a single song. The other years have more than one. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nWait no, wait. Let me double-check. The claim says \"the only ear that do not have multiple song.\" So if there are multiple ears (years) without multiple songs, it would be false. But in our case, 2005 is the only year with one song, and all others have two or more.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are all rows from 1 to 6, specifically looking at the \"year\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"only 1 of the artist list from the remix dead guy remix have the name of a state.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse this carefully. The key points are:\n\n1. We're looking at entries where the remix is \"dead guys remix\" (I notice in the table it's written as \"dead guys remix\" and also with a capital 'D' sometimes, but I think that might be just a typo or variation; the main thing is whether the remix column has \"dead guy remix\" as per the claim).\n\nWait, no. Let me check the claim again: it mentions \"remix dead guy remix.\" But looking at the table, rows 1-4 have 'remix' as \"dead guys remix,\" and rows 5-6 have \"dee - lux remix.\" So in the table, there's a mix of 'dead guys remix' (with an 's') and another type. The claim refers to \"dead guy remix\" without the 's,' which is different from what's in the table.\n\nWait, that might be a confusion. Let me double-check: \n\n- Row 1: \"remix: dead guys remix.\"\n- Row 2: same as row 1.\n- Row 3: same as above.\n- Row 4: same.\n- Rows 5 and 6 have \"dee - lux remix.\"\n\nSo the claim is about artists whose song has a remix named \"dead guy remix.\" But in the table, all the remixes for rows 1-4 are \"dead guys remix,\" plural. So maybe there's a typo in the claim? Or perhaps it's intended to match regardless of the 's'?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in typing, but as per the given data, I'll proceed with what's written.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"remix dead guy remix.\" So, looking for entries where the remix column is exactly \"dead guy remix.\" But in the table, it's \"dead guys remix\" (with 's'). Therefore, perhaps there are no entries with that exact remix name. But that would make the entire claim false because if none have that remix, then talking about artists from such a list doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the plural as well, treating \"dead guys remix\" as similar to \"dead guy remix.\" That might be a stretch, but perhaps it's intended.\n\nLet me proceed under both assumptions:\n\nAssumption 1: The claim refers to entries with exactly \"dead guy remix.\" In that case, in our table, there are none because the remix is always \"dead guys remix\" (plural). So the list would have zero artists. Therefore, the statement that only one artist has a state name would be false because the premise itself is invalid.\n\nAssumption 2: The claim refers to entries with \"dead guys remix.\" In this case, we have four such entries (rows 1-4). Then, among these four artists, how many have names that are states?\n\nLooking at the artists in rows 1-4:\n\nRow 1: Blondie\nRow 2: Chicane\nRow 3: Lamb\nRow 4: Texas\n\nNow, \"Texas\" is a U.S. state. The others (Blondie, Chicane, Lamb) don't correspond to any U.S. states.\n\nTherefore, only one artist in the list has a name that's a state (Texas). So if we consider the remix as \"dead guys remix,\" then the claim would be TRUE because only Texas is a state.\n\nBut given that the claim specifies \"remix dead guy remix\" without the 's,' which isn't present in any of the table entries, perhaps it's intended to match all rows with any variation. Alternatively, maybe I should consider case insensitivity or minor typos.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake and meant \"dead guys remix.\" If that's the case, then only Texas is the state, so the claim would be TRUE.\n\nBut considering the exact wording in the table, since all four rows have \"remix: dead guys remix,\" which is plural, but the claim refers to singular, perhaps there's a discrepancy. Therefore, depending on how strict we are with the remix name matching.\n\nWait, let me look again:\n\nThe claim says \"the artist list from the remix dead guy remix.\" So the remix must be exactly \"dead guy remix\" (singular). In our table, all four rows have \"dead guys remix\" (plural), so perhaps they don't match. Therefore, the artist list would be empty because none of the remixes are named \"dead guy remix.\"\n\nIf that's the case, then the claim is about an empty list. The statement says only 1 artist in this list has a state name, but since the list is empty, it's impossible for there to be exactly one such artist. Therefore, the claim would be FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should interpret \"dead guy remix\" as a partial match, so any remix that includes \"dead guys\" or similar could count. But that might not be precise.\n\nWait, but let me think again: The table has rows with \"remix: dead guys remix.\" So if the claim is about that exact string, then it's four artists. Among them, only Texas is a state. Therefore, the statement would be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014because the claim specifies \"dead guy remix\" (singular). Since the remix in the table is plural (\"dead guys\"), perhaps they don't match. So the list would have zero artists, making it impossible for one artist to have a state name. Hence, the claim would be FALSE because it's asserting that only one exists when actually none do.\n\nBut this depends on whether we consider \"dead guy remix\" and \"dead guys remix\" as the same. If they are considered different, then the claim is about an empty list, making the statement false. If they're considered the same (perhaps a typo), then it's TRUE.\n\nGiven that in the table, all four rows have \"remix: dead guys remix,\" which is plural, and the claim refers to singular, perhaps the answer should be FALSE because there are no entries matching exactly, so the list is empty. Therefore, the statement is FALSE as it claims one exists when none do.\n\nWait, but another angle: Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps \"dead guy remix\" in the claim is a typo and meant to refer to \"dead guys remix.\" In that case, then among those four artists, only Texas is a state, making the claim TRUE.\n\nBut since we have to work strictly with what's given, perhaps it's better to go with exact matches. So, if the remix must be exactly \"dead guy remix,\" which isn't present in the table, then there are zero artists, so the claim that only one exists is FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check all remix entries for any occurrence of 'dead' or similar and proceed accordingly.\n\nWait, looking at rows 5 and 6: their remixes are \"dee - lux remix,\" which don't match. So perhaps only rows 1-4 have the \"dead\" in their remix name. But since the claim specifies \"dead guy remix,\" not plural, then those four rows might be considered as not matching.\n\nBut this is getting a bit confusing. To resolve this, let me clarify:\n\nThe exact wording of the claim: \"the artist list from the remix dead guy remix.\" So it's looking for entries where the remix is exactly named \"dead guy remix.\"\n\nIn our table, all four relevant rows have \"remix: dead guys remix,\" which is plural. Therefore, they don't match. Hence, no artists are in that list.\n\nTherefore, the claim says only one artist exists with a state name, but since there's none (the list is empty), the statement is FALSE because it's asserting the existence of exactly one when there are zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm being too strict and should consider case-insensitive or partial matches. If so, then we have four artists, among whom only Texas is a state, making the claim TRUE.\n\nBut given that programming problems usually require exact matching unless stated otherwise, perhaps the answer is FALSE because none of the remixes match \"dead guy remix\" exactly.\n\nWait, but let me check again:\n\n- The claim's remix name: \"dead guy remix\"\n\n- The table's remix names in rows 1-4: \"dead guys remix\"\n\nSince they are not the same string (plural vs. singular), perhaps it's considered different. Therefore, no artists match that remix, making the artist list empty.\n\nThus, the statement that only one artist exists would be FALSE because there are none.\n\nBut this might vary based on interpretation. Alternatively, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that \"dead guy remix\" and \"dead guys remix\" are meant to refer to the same thing, perhaps a typo in the problem.\n\nGiven that, then among rows 1-4, Texas is a state, so the claim would be TRUE.\n\nBut since the question might expect us to go with exact matches, perhaps it's safer to say FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and should proceed under the assumption that it's intended to match \"dead guys remix,\" hence making the statement TRUE.\n\nIn conclusion, given the ambiguity, but considering common sense in problem-solving where such typos are overlooked, the answer is likely TRUE. However, if we take exact string matching, it's FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe task is to determine how many artists from a specific list have names that correspond to U.S. states. The list is defined by entries with a remix named \"dead guy remix.\" Upon reviewing the data:\n\n- **Rows 1-4** in the table have remixes labeled as \"dead guys remix\" (plural), which doesn't exactly match the claim's \"dead guy remix\" (singular).\n- Among these four artists, only \"Texas\" is a U.S. state.\n\nConsidering that the remix names don't exactly match, but assuming the intention was to refer to those with \"dead guys remix,\" we proceed:\n\nOnly Texas is a state among the listed artists. Therefore, the claim is valid.\n\n**Answer:** TRUE",

The claim says: \"there be 1 single song that be produce after 2003 that do not have an album title list.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The key points are:\n1. The song must be produced after 2003.\n2. It's a single song (only one such instance).\n3. This song does not have an album title listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows, each representing different songs with details like year, artist, song name, album, and remix.\n\nI'll go through each row to check if it meets these criteria.\n\nRow 1: Year is 2003. The claim specifies after 2003, so this doesn't count. Also, the album is listed as \"the curse of blondie,\" which means it has an album title.\n\nRow 2: Year is 2003 again. Same as row 1; it's not after 2003. Album is listed too.\n\nRow 3: Year is 2003. Not relevant. Album exists.\n\nRow 4: Year is 2005, which is after 2003. The album here is \"red book.\" So the album is listed. This doesn't meet the condition because we're looking for a song without an album title.\n\nRow 5: Year is 2010, so after 2003. The album is \"turn it up,\" which means there's an album title. Doesn't fit.\n\nRow 6: Year is 2010, so after 2003. Now, looking at the album column here, it says \"n/a.\" That probably stands for 'not available' or no album listed. So this song doesn't have an album title in the table.\n\nSo row 6 meets all conditions: produced after 2003 and has no album title listed. Is there only one such instance? Let's check again:\n\nRows 1-4 are either 2003 or have albums. Rows 5 and 6 are both 2010, but only row 6 lacks an album title. So yes, exactly one song meets the criteria.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there's exactly one song after 2003 without an album listed.

Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"the song from dee  - lux remix be preform by different artist but the song be all from the same year.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse this a bit more clearly. It seems like there are two parts to the claim:\n\n1. The songs with the 'dee - lux remix' are performed by different artists.\n2. All these songs are from the same year.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll go through each row and check for entries where the remix is 'dee - lux remix'. \n\nRow 5: Year 2010, Artist Pixie Lott, Song Turn It Up, Album Turn It Up, Remix dee - lux remix.\nRow 6: Year 2010, Artist Perry Mystique, Song Party Like Ur 18 feat Sway, Album N/A, Remix dee - lux remix.\n\nSo there are two songs remixed by 'dee - lux remix': one by Pixie Lott and another by Perry Mystique.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the year 2003 have as many song as 2005\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and identify all the rows that correspond to the years 2003 and 2005. The relevant columns here are \"year\", \"artist\", and \"song\".\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Year is 2003, artist is Blondie, song is Good Boys.\n- Row 2: Year is 2003, artist is Chicane, song is Locking Down.\n- Row 3: Year is 2003, artist is Lamb, song is Wonder.\n- Row 4: Year is 2005, artist is Texas, song is Can't Resist.\n\nSo, for the year 2003, there are three entries. Each of these rows represents a different song because each has a unique \"song\" value. So that's three songs in 2003.\n\nFor the year 2005, there's only one entry: Row 4, which is Can't Resist by Texas. That means only one song in 2005.\n\nThe claim says that both years have as many songs, meaning they should be equal. But clearly, 2003 has three songs and 2005 has just one. So the numbers aren't equal.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there are more songs in 2003 than in 2005.\n\nNow, I need to list all the relevant cells that were checked. These include each row's \"year\" and \"song\" columns for both years mentioned in the claim. So, rows 1-3 (all year 2003) and row 4 (year 2005) are involved.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Rows 1, 2, 3: each has column \"year\" as 2003 and their respective songs.\n- Row 4: column \"year\" as 2005 and its song.\n\nThis gives me a total of three rows for 2003 and one row for 2005.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"only 1 of the artist list from the dee- lux remix have the name of a state.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what this means. We're looking at all entries in the table where the remix is \"dee- lux remix.\" For each of these entries, we'll check if the artist's name is that of a state. The claim states there should be exactly one such case.\n\nLooking at the table, I see two rows with \"remix: dee- lux remix.\" These are row 5 and row 6.\n\nRow 5:\nArtist: Pixie Lott\nAlbum: Turn It Up\n\nRow 6:\nArtist: Perry Mystique\nSong: Party Like Ur 18 feat Sway\nAlbum: N/A\n\nWait, actually, the claim is about the artist list from the dee- lux remix. So I need to look at all entries where remix is \"dee- lux remix\" and then check their artists.\n\nSo in row 5, the artist is Pixie Lott. Is that a state name? No, it's a person's name. Row 6 has Perry Mystique as the artist. That also doesn't sound like a state name. \n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me double-check all rows where remix is \"dee- lux remix.\" Only row 5 and 6 have that remix.\n\nIn row 5: Artist is Pixie Lott. Not a state.\nRow 6: Artist is Perry Mystique. Also not a state.\n\nHmm, so according to this, none of the artists from the dee- lux remix are named after states. So the claim says \"only 1,\" but actually, there are zero such cases. Therefore, the claim would be FALSE.\n\nWait, am I interpreting the claim correctly? The claim is: \"only 1 of the artist list from the dee- lux remix have the name of a state.\" If none of them do, then it's not true that only one does; in fact, zero do. So the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are rows 5 and 6 where the remix is \"dee- lux remix,\" checking their artist names to see if any match state names.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"artist\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"there be 1 single artist that be produce after 2005 that have an album title list.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse what this means. It seems like it's asking whether there's at least one artist who released something (probably a song) after the year 2005 and has an album listed in their entry.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Rows 1 to 4 are from 2003 or earlier, so they don't count because we're looking for releases after 2005.\n- Rows 5 and 6 are from 2010, which is after 2005. So these are the only rows that could potentially satisfy the condition.\n\nNow, let's look at each of these rows:\n\nRow 5: Artist is Pixie Lott. The album is \"turn it up.\" That means she has an album title listed.\nRow 6: Artist is Perry Mystique. The album is marked as \"n/a,\" which I assume stands for not available or no album listed.\n\nSo, Row 5 definitely meets the criteria because she was produced after 2005 and her album is listed. \n\nTherefore, there is at least one artist (Pixie Lott) that fits the claim. So the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cell is in row 5 under \"album.\" \n\nWait, but I need to check if \"artist\" and \"year\" are also relevant since they determine whether it's an artist after 2005. So actually, both the \"year\" and \"album\" columns for Row 5 are important.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be row 5, column year and row 5, column album.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"album\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to handling such tasks, so I'll take it slow and make sure I understand everything correctly.\n\nFirst, the task is to determine whether a given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE based on the information provided in the table. The table has six rows, each representing different songs with various details like year, artist, song name, album, and remix. \n\nThe claim to evaluate is: \"the song from the dee  - lux remix be perform by the same art and the song be from different year.\" \n\nHmm, okay. Let me break this down. The claim seems a bit broken in terms of grammar, so I'll try to parse it correctly. It looks like it's saying that songs remixed by \"dee - lux\" are performed by the same artist, but these songs come from different years.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me read it again: \"the song from the dee  - lux remix be perform by the same art and the song be from different year.\" So perhaps it's saying that both songs with the dee - lux remix are performed by the same artist and come from different years.\n\nBut looking at the table, let's check the rows where the remix is \"dee - lux remix.\"\n\nFrom the table:\n\nRow 5: Year 2010, Artist Pixie Lott, Song Turn It Up, Album Turn It Up, Remix dee - lux remix.\nRow 6: Year 2010, Artist Perry Mystique, Song Party Like Ur 18 feat Sway, Album N/A, Remix dee - lux remix.\n\nSo both rows have the same remix (\"dee - lux remix\") but different artists (Pixie Lott and Perry Mystique). \n\nWait, so the claim says that these songs are performed by the same artist. But in reality, they're two different artists. So that part is false. Also, both are from the same year (2010), not different years as the claim suggests.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because:\n\n1. The artists are different.\n2. Both songs are from the same year.\n\nSo when checking the relevant cells, we need to look at the rows where remix is \"dee - lux remix,\" which are rows 5 and 6. For each of these rows, we check the artist and year columns.\n\nRow 5: Artist Pixie Lott (2010)\nRow 6: Artist Perry Mystique (2010)\n\nBoth have different artists but same year. Therefore, the claim's conditions are not met.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that songs with the \"dee - lux remix\" are performed by the same artist and from different years. However, examining rows 5 and 6 of the table shows two different artists (Pixie Lott and Perry Mystique) both from the year 2010. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
