    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with some data about long jump performances. The claim is: \"the majority of the athlete with the longest mark be from the united state.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to find out what the longest mark is in the table. Looking at each row's 'mark' column:\n\nRow 1: 8.95 m\nRow 2: 8.90 m\nRow 3: 8.87 m\nRow 4: 8.86 m\nRow 5: 8.74 m\nRow 6: 8.74 m\nRow 7: 8.74 m\nRow 8: 8.73 m\nRow 9: 8.71 m\nRow 10: 8.66 m\n\nSo the longest mark is 8.95 meters by Mike Powell from row 1.\n\nNow, the claim says that the majority of the athletes with this longest mark are from the United States. But wait, Mike Powell is the only athlete with the longest mark. So if there's only one person, does \"majority\" apply? A majority usually means more than half, but here it's just one.\n\nSo since there's only one athlete with the longest mark and he's from the US, can we say the majority are from the US? I think yes because 100% of them (which is Mike) are American. So the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe longest mark is achieved by a single athlete from the United States.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"mark\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"athlete\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"Erick Walder and Bob Beamon have the same wind\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has several rows with different athletes' details. Each row includes columns like mark, wind, athlete, nationality, venue, and date. My task is to check the wind values for Erick Walder and Bob Beamon.\n\nI know that in track and field events, especially long jumps, wind can affect performance. The wind speed is measured, and if it's above a certain threshold (like 2.0 m/s), it might invalidate the jump or at least note it as an aid. So, checking their winds could be important for records.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nRow 2: Bob Beamon. His mark was 8.90 m in Mexico City on October 18, 1968. The wind column shows \"wind: 2.0\".\n\nThen, looking for Erick Walder. Scanning down, I find Row 6: Erick Walder, mark 8.74 m at El Paso on April 2, 1994. His wind is also listed as \"wind: 2.0\".\n\nSo both Bob Beamon and Erick Walder have a wind of 2.0 m/s according to the table.\n\nWait, but I should double-check that there are no other entries for these athletes or any possible typos in names. Let me make sure I didn't mix up any rows.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Row 2: Bob Beamon, wind 2.0\n- Row 6: Erick Walder, wind 2.0\n\nNo other rows mention either of them. So both have the same wind speed as per the table data.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because their winds are both 2.0.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wind\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"wind\"}\n   ]\n}",

Let me go through each row and check the 'mark' column.\n\nRow 1: The mark is 8.95 m (29ft4\u00bcin). Since it's over 29 feet, this counts.\nRow 2: Mark is 8.90 m (29ft2\u00bcin). Also over 29, so another one.\nRow 3: 8.87 m (29ft1in). Still over 29, adding to the count.\nRow 4: 8.86 m (29ft0\u00bein). Just barely over 29 feet, so it counts as well.\nRows 5-10 all have marks below 29 feet when converted from meters or are exactly at 28ft which is less than 29.\n\nSo, that's four athletes with marks exceeding 29 feet.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"the most recent long jump record be set by dwight phillips\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully. It states that the most recent long jump record was set by Dwight Phillips. To verify this, I need to check two main things: which row in the table corresponds to Dwight Phillips and whether his record is indeed the most recent one listed.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different athlete's performance with details like mark, wind, nationality, venue, and date. The rows are numbered from 1 to 10. I'll go through each row to find where Dwight Phillips is mentioned.\n\nRow 7: It mentions Dwight Phillips with a mark of 8.74 m (28ft8in), wind speed of 1.2, venue in Eugene, and the date June 7, 2009. That's the only entry for him in this table.\n\nNow, I need to check if this is indeed the most recent record. To do that, I'll look at all the dates in each row and see which one is the latest.\n\nRow 1: August 30, 1991\nRow 2: October 18, 1968\nRow 3: August 30, 1991\nRow 4: May 22, 1987\nRow 5: July 18, 1988\nRow 6: April 2, 1994\nRow 7: June 7, 2009\nRow 8: May 24, 2008\nRow 9: July 18, 1995\nRow 10: June 2, 2007\n\nComparing all these dates, the latest one is June 7, 2009, which corresponds to Dwight Phillips in Row 7. The next most recent date after that would be May 24, 2008 (Row 8) and then June 2, 2007 (Row 10). So, Dwight's record is indeed the most recent in this table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Dwight Phillips set the most recent long jump record on June 7, 2009. The relevant cell here is Row 7, specifically the date column which shows it's the latest.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as Dwight Phillips' record from June 7, 2009, is the most recent in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"bob beamon be the athlete who set his long jump record the longest time ago.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. It's saying that Bob Beamon holds the record for having his long jump record stand the longest period before being broken. Or wait, no\u2014actually, maybe it's about when he set his personal record and how long ago that was compared to others in the table.\n\nWait, looking at the table, each row represents a different athlete's performance. The claim is about Bob Beamon setting his record the longest time ago. So I need to check for each athlete's date, calculate how much time has passed since then, and see if Bob Beamon's is indeed the oldest (longest time ago).\n\nLet me look at the table rows:\n\nRow 1: Mike Powell, August 30, 1991\nRow 2: Bob Beamon, October 18, 1968\nRow 3: Carl Lewis, August 30, 1991\nRow 4: Robert Emmiyan, May 22, 1987\nRow 5: Larry Myricks, July 18, 1988\nRow 6: Erick Walder, April 2, 1994\nRow 7: Dwight Phillips, June 7, 2009\nRow 8: Irving Saladino, May 24, 2008\nRow 9: Iv\u00e1n Pedroso, July 18, 1995\nRow 10: Lo\u00fais Ts\u00e1toumas, June 2, 2007\n\nNow, the current year is 2023. So I'll calculate the time elapsed from each date to 2023.\n\nBob Beamon's date is October 18, 1968. From 1968 to 2023 is 55 years. Let me check others:\n\nMike Powell: 1991 to 2023 is 32 years.\nCarl Lewis same as Mike, so 32 years.\nRobert Emmiyan: 1987 to 2023 is 36 years.\nLarry Myricks: 1988 to 2023 is 35 years.\nErick Walder: 1994 to 2023 is 29 years.\nDwight Phillips: 2009 to 2023 is 14 years.\nIrving Saladino: 2008 to 2023 is 15 years.\nIv\u00e1n Pedroso: 1995 to 2023 is 28 years.\nLo\u00fais Ts\u00e1toumas: 2007 to 2023 is 16 years.\n\nSo the oldest date is Bob Beamon in 1968, which is indeed the longest time ago. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to identify which parts of the table support this conclusion. The key information is each athlete's name and their respective dates. So for each row, the \"athlete\" and \"date\" columns are important.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Row 0 (Bob Beamon): column \"athlete\" and \"date\"\nWait no\u2014the rows start at index 1 in the table? Wait, looking back, the user provided rows starting from Row 1 to Row 10. So Bob Beamon is Row 2 (index 1 if we count from 0). But in the JSON example, it starts with row_index as 0 for the first row.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The table has 10 rows, each labeled Row 1 to Row 10. In programming terms, indexes usually start at 0, so Row 1 would be index 0, Row 2 is index 1, etc.\n\nSo Bob Beamon is in Row 2, which is index 1. So the relevant cells for him are row_index 1, columns \"athlete\" and \"date\".\n\nSimilarly, all other athletes' rows need to be checked for their dates. So each row's \"athlete\" and \"date\" columns are relevant because we're comparing all of them to see who has the oldest date.\n\nSo for each row from 0 to 9 (assuming Row 1 is index 0), the \"athlete\" and \"date\" columns are relevant. Therefore, the list will include each row's athlete and date.\n\nBut wait, in the JSON example, it's a list of objects with row_index and column_name. So for each athlete, we have two entries: one for \"athlete\" and one for \"date\".\n\nSo for Bob Beamon (Row 2, index 1), we include {\"row_1\", \"athlete\"} and {\"row_1\", \"date\"}.\n\nSimilarly, for all other rows, same applies. So the relevant_cells list would have entries for each row's athlete and date columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"athlete\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"athlete\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"athlete\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"athlete\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"athlete\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"athlete\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"athlete\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"athlete\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"athlete\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"athlete\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So I have a table with ten rows of data about long jump athletes. Each row has details like mark, wind speed, athlete name, nationality, venue, and date. The claim is: \"all athletes have the same wind except eric walder and bob beamon.\" Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part means. The main point is about the wind speeds being the same across all athletes, but with exceptions for Eric Walder and Bob Beamon. So, if that's the case, their wind speeds should be different from everyone else, right?\n\nLet me look at each row one by one and note the wind speeds.\n\nRow 1: Mike Powell, wind 0.3\nRow 2: Bob Beamon, wind 2.0\nRow 3: Carl Lewis, wind 0.2\nRow 4: Robert Emmiyan, wind 1.9\nRow 5: Larry Myricks, wind 1.4\nRow 6: Erick Walder, wind 2.0\nRow 7: Dwight Phillips, wind 1.2\nRow 8: Irving Saladino, wind 1.2\nRow 9: Iv\u00e1n Pedroso, wind 1.9\nRow 10: Lo\u00fais Ts\u00e1toumas, wind 1.6\n\nWait a second. So the claim says all athletes have the same wind except Eric Walder and Bob Beamon. But looking at the data, the wind speeds vary across the table. For example, Mike has 0.3, Carl has 0.2, and so on. So it's not like everyone else has the same wind speed except those two.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says \"all athletes have the same wind except Eric Walder and Bob Beamon.\" That would mean that all other athletes besides these two have identical wind speeds. But looking at the data, each athlete's wind speed is different or varies among them. \n\nFor instance, Bob Beamon has 2.0, Eric Walder also has 2.0. So if the others are supposed to be the same, but Mike has 0.3, Carl has 0.2, etc., that doesn't hold. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because there's no common wind speed among all athletes except those two; instead, each athlete has a different wind or at least more varied winds.\n\nSo the relevant cells are the wind speeds for each athlete to check this. That means rows 1 through 10, specifically looking at the 'wind' column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because not all athletes have the same wind speed except Eric Walder and Bob Beamon. The wind speeds vary across different athletes.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:** It states that all athletes except Eric Walder and Bob Beamon share the same wind speed.\n2. **Examine Wind Speeds in the Table:**\n   - Mike Powell: 0.3\n   - Bob Beamon: 2.0\n   - Carl Lewis: 0.2\n   - Robert Emmiyan: 1.9\n   - Larry Myricks: 1.4\n   - Eric Walder: 2.0\n   - Dwight Phillips: 1.2\n   - Irving Saladino: 1.2\n   - Iv\u00e1n Pedroso: 1.9\n   - Lo\u00fais Ts\u00e1toumas: 1.6\n\n3. **Check for Uniform Wind Speeds:** The wind speeds are not uniform except for Bob Beamon and Eric Walder who both have 2.0, but others vary.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the wind speeds are different across athletes beyond just Bob and Eric, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"wind\"},\n     {\"row_1\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wind\"},\n     {\"row_2\": 2, \"column_name\": \"wind\"},\n     {\"row_3\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wind\"},\n     {\"row_4\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wind\"},\n     {\"row_5\": 5, \"column_name\": \"wind\"},\n     {\"row_6\": 6, \"column_name\": \"wind\"},\n     {\"row_7\": 7, \"column_name\": \"wind\"},\n     {\"row_8\": 8, \"column_name\": \"wind\"},\n     {\"row_9\": 9, \"column_name\": \"wind\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Row 5: Mark is 8.74 m (28ft8in) \u2013 that's exactly 28 feet and 8 inches, which is more than 28 feet.\n6. Row 6: Mark is also 8.74 m (28ft8in) a \u2013 same as above.\n7. Row 7: Another 8.74 m (28ft8in) \u2013 consistent.\n8. Row 8: Mark is 8.73 m (28ft7\u00bdin) \u2013 just under 28 feet and 8 inches, still over 28.\n9. Row 9: Mark is 8.71 m (28ft6\u00bein) \u2013 about 28 feet 6.75 inches.\n10. Row 10: Mark is 8.66 m (28ft4\u00bein) \u2013 that's exactly 28 feet and 4.75 inches.\n\nWait, the claim says \"a mark of 28 foot,\" but looking at the data, most entries are either above or just slightly below 29 feet. The only marks near 28 feet are in rows 5-10. Let me check each one:\n\nRows 5: 28ft8in \u2013 that's more than 28 feet.\nRow 6: Same as row 5, also 28ft8in.\nRow 7: Also 28ft8in.\nRow 8: 28ft7\u00bdin \u2013 still over 28 feet.\nRow 9: 28ft6\u00bein \u2013 over 28 feet.\nRow 10: 28ft4\u00bein \u2013 exactly 28.38 meters, which is just over 28 feet.\n\nBut the claim says \"a mark of 28 foot.\" Nowhere in the table do I see a mark that's exactly 28 feet. All entries are either more or less than 28 feet but not exactly. For example:\n\n- Rows 5-10 have marks starting at 28ft4\u00bein up to 28ft8in.\n- The other rows (1-4) are over 29ft.\n\nSo, there's no athlete in the table who has a mark of exactly 28 feet. Therefore, the claim that four athletes have such a mark is incorrect because none meet exactly 28 feet.\n\nI think I might have made a mistake earlier by not checking each row correctly. Let me recount:\n\n- Rows 1-4: All above 29ft.\n- Rows 5-10: Marks are between approximately 28ft4in and 28ft8in, which is more than 28 feet but less than 29 feet.\n\nSo, none of the marks are exactly 28 feet. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no athlete with a mark of exactly 28 feet.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"mark\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"mark\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mark\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"mark\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"mark\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"mark\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"few athlete from the united state have the longest mark\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that few athletes from the United States have the longest mark. So, this implies that most of the top marks (longest) are held by non-American athletes.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 10 rows, each representing an athlete's performance with details like mark, wind speed, athlete name, nationality, venue, and date.\n\nI'll start by identifying all the athletes from the United States. Scanning through the 'nationality' column:\n\n- Row 1: Mike Powell (United States)\n- Row 2: Bob Beamon (United States)\n- Row 3: Carl Lewis (United States)\n- Row 4: Robert Emmiyan (Soviet Union) \u2013 not US\n- Row 5: Larry Myricks (United States)\n- Row 6: Erick Walder (United States)\n- Row 7: Dwight Phillips (United States)\n- Row 8: Irving Saladino (Panama) \u2013 not US\n- Row 9: Iv\u00e1n Pedroso (Cuba) \u2013 not US\n- Row 10: Lo\u00fais Ts\u00e1toumas (Greece) \u2013 not US\n\nSo, the athletes from the United States are in rows 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7. That's six athletes.\n\nNext, I need to determine who has the longest mark. The 'mark' column shows the distance jumped. Let me list the marks:\n\n- Row 1: 8.95 m\n- Row 2: 8.90 m\n- Row 3: 8.87 m\n- Row 4: 8.86 m\n- Row 5: 8.74 m\n- Row 6: 8.74 m\n- Row 7: 8.74 m\n- Row 8: 8.73 m\n- Row 9: 8.71 m\n- Row 10: 8.66 m\n\nThe longest mark is in row 1 with 8.95 meters by Mike Powell from the United States. The next longest is 8.90 meters by Bob Beamon, also US. Then 8.87, which is Carl Lewis (US), followed by Robert Emmiyan at 8.86 m.\n\nSo the top four marks are all held by US athletes: Mike Powell, Bob Beamon, Carl Lewis, and Robert Emmiyan isn't a US athlete, wait no\u2014Robert is from Soviet Union. So actually, row 4 is not US. So the top three longest marks are all US athletes:\n\n1. Mike Powell (8.95 m)\n2. Bob Beamon (8.90 m)\n3. Carl Lewis (8.87 m)\n\nThen comes Robert Emmiyan with 8.86 m, but he's not from the US.\n\nNow, considering the claim: \"few athlete from the united state have the longest mark.\" If 'longest' refers to the top marks, then the US athletes dominate the top spots.\n\nBut wait, the term 'longest mark' could be interpreted in two ways. It might mean that only a few (maybe just one or two) US athletes hold the very longest records, but looking at the data, the top three are all US athletes, which is more than a few\u2014so if the claim implies that few have it, but actually many do, then it's false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 'longest mark' refers to only the absolute record. Mike Powell has 8.95 m, which is the longest. So only one US athlete holds the single longest mark. If the claim is about having the longest, then only Mike Powell does, so 'few' would mean just a couple, but in reality, only one. However, if we consider that Bob Beamon and Carl Lewis are close behind, perhaps it's more than just a few.\n\nBut another angle: maybe the claim refers to the number of US athletes compared to others who have achieved long marks. Looking at all rows, most of the top performers (rows 1-3) are US athletes. So if the claim says that only a few US athletes have the longest mark, but in reality, several do, then the claim is false.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The table lists performances, not necessarily world records. So perhaps each row is a significant jump, but Mike Powell's 8.95 m was actually a world record. Bob Beamon had an 8.90 m which was also a famous jump in 1968.\n\nSo considering that, the US athletes dominate the top marks. Therefore, if the claim says only few have the longest mark, but in reality many do, then the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about whether most of the longest marks are held by non-US athletes, which isn't the case here. So the correct answer would be FALSE because US athletes actually have several of the longest marks, so it's not that few have them.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the nationality and mark columns for each row to check who holds the top marks.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because multiple US athletes hold the longest marks, contrary to the implication that only a few do.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column\": \"mark\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column\": \"mark\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column\": \"mark\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column\": \"mark\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column\": \"mark\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column\": \"mark\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column\": \"mark\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column\": \"mark\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column\": \"mark\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column\": \"mark\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"Bob Beamond have recently set his long jump record\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look for Bob Beamon in the table. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Mike Powell\n- Row 2: Bob Beamon\n- Row 3: Carl Lewis\n- And so on...\n\nOkay, found Bob Beamon in Row 2. Now, what information do we have about him? The mark is 8.90 m (29ft2\u00bcin), wind speed of 2.0, venue Mexico City, date October 18, 1968.\n\nThe claim says he \"recently\" set the record. I need to check how recent that was. The date in Row 2 is October 18, 1968. That's over 50 years ago, which doesn't align with the word \"recently.\" \n\nAlso, looking at other records in the table, like Mike Powell in 1991 and Carl Lewis also in 1991, these are more recent than 1968 but still a few decades back. The latest date in the table is June 7, 2009 (Row 7). So Bob Beamon's record was set much earlier.\n\nTherefore, the claim that he \"recently\" set his record isn't accurate because 1968 is not recent by any standard. \n\nI should also consider if there are any other relevant cells. The wind speed might matter in some contexts, but the main issue here is the date. So, Row 2's 'date' column is crucial.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Bob Beamon set his record a long time ago, so the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to Bob Beamon setting a record recently, but according to the table, his record was in 1968. Therefore, it's false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It states that Dwight Phillips was the first person to set a long jump record. I'm assuming the claim refers to setting a world record in the long jump event.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has several rows with details about different athletes, their marks, wind speeds, nationalities, venues, and dates. Each row represents a performance or possibly a record attempt.\n\nI need to check if Dwight Phillips is indeed the first person listed here who set a record. Let me go through each row in order:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Mike Powell with a mark of 8.95 m on August 30, 1991.\n2. **Row 2**: Bob Beamon with 8.90 m on October 18, 1968.\n3. **Row 3**: Carl Lewis with 8.87 m on August 30, 1991.\n4. **Row 4**: Robert Emmiyan with 8.86 m on May 22, 1987.\n5. **Row 5**: Larry Myricks with 8.74 m on July 18, 1988.\n6. **Row 6**: Erick Walder with 8.74 m on April 2, 1994.\n7. **Row 7**: Dwight Phillips with 8.74 m on June 7, 2009.\n8. **Row 8**: Irving Saladino with 8.73 m on May 24, 2008.\n9. **Row 9**: Iv\u00e1n Pedroso with 8.71 m on July 18, 1995.\n10. **Row 10**: Lo\u00fais Ts\u00e1toumas with 8.66 m on June 2, 2007.\n\nNow, I need to see who was the first in this table to set a record. The claim is about Dwight Phillips being the first. But looking at the dates:\n\n- Bob Beamon's mark was in 1968.\n- Mike Powell and Carl Lewis both jumped in 1991.\n- Robert Emmiyan in 1987.\n- Larry Myricks in 1988.\n- Erick Walder in 1994.\n- Dwight Phillips in 2009.\n- Others have later dates.\n\nSo, Bob Beamon's record is the earliest here, from 1968. Mike Powell set his mark in 1991, which might be a later record but not necessarily the first since it's after Beamon.\n\nThe claim says Dwight Phillips was the first person to set a long jump record. However, according to the table, Bob Beamon did so in 1968, and Mike Powell in 1991. Therefore, Dwight Phillips, who jumped in 2009, cannot be the first as there are earlier records.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells would include the rows where Dwight Phillips' mark is listed (Row 7) and perhaps Bob Beamon's record to show he was before.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"athlete\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"athlete\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
