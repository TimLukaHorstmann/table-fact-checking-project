    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"Phyllis Nelson make the US Hot 100 2 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions Phyllis Nelson. Looking at the table, I don't see any rows that mention her name directly. The singles listed are \"don't stop the train,\" \"move closer,\" \"i don' t know,\" and \"i like you.\" None of these are associated with Phyllis Nelson as far as I can tell.\n\nNext, the claim says she made it to the US Hot 100 two times. In the table, there's a column called \"us hot 100\" which shows rankings for singles. For each row, let me check if this column has any entries:\n\n- Row 1: us hot 100 is \"-\"\n- Row 2: us hot 100 is \"-\"\n- Row 3: us hot 100 is 61\n- Row 4: us hot 100 is 61\n- Row 5: us hot 100 is \"-\"\n\nSo, only Rows 3 and 4 have entries in the US Hot 100 column. But looking at those rows, they're about singles \"i don' t know\" and \"i like you.\" There's no indication that Phyllis Nelson was involved with these singles.\n\nSince there are no mentions of Phyllis Nelson in any row and the only two entries in US Hot 100 aren't linked to her, it seems the claim isn't supported by the data. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not list any singles for Phyllis Nelson or indicate she made the US Hot 100 twice.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"move closer and move (re - issue) be the only single not to make it to the chart.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this means. It seems like the claim is asserting that these two singles didn't chart at all in any of the categories listed in the table (US Hot 100, US Dance, US R&B). So, I should check each relevant single and see if they have any rankings in these columns.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: Single is \"don't stop the train.\" The US Hot 100 column has a dash, which probably means it didn't chart there. The US Dance is 20, so that's a chart position. So this single did make it to the chart in US Dance.\n\n- Rows 2 and 5: Both are singles titled \"move closer\" or \"move closer (re-issue)\". For both entries, all the ranking columns (US Hot 100, US Dance, US R&B) have dashes. That suggests neither of these made it to any of the charts listed.\n\n- Rows 3 and 4: Singles are \"i don't know\" and \"i like you.\" Both have numbers in the rankings\u2014specifically, US Hot 100 is 61 for both, US Dance is 1, and US R&B is 65. So these singles did chart.\n\nNow, let's break down the claim: It says that \"move closer\" (from row 2) and \"move closer (re-issue)\" (row 5) are the only singles not to make it to any chart. Looking at all rows:\n\n- Rows 1 has a single that charted in US Dance.\n- Row 2 didn't chart anywhere.\n- Rows 3 and 4 did chart.\n- Row 5 also didn't chart.\n\nWait, so both row 2 and row 5 have singles that didn't make it to any chart. So the claim says these two are the only ones not to chart. But looking at the table, those are indeed the only two singles without any numbers in their ranking columns\u2014all others (rows 1,3,4) have at least one chart position.\n\nSo according to this, the claim is TRUE because \"move closer\" and its re-issue didn't chart, and all other singles did. \n\nI should also note which cells are relevant for each single:\n\nFor row 2 (\"move closer\"), checking US Hot 100, US Dance, US R&B\u2014all have dashes.\n\nFor row 5 (\"move closer (re-issue)\"), same thing\u2014dashes in all ranking columns.\n\nThe other singles either have numbers or don't fit the claim of being non-charting.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"us r&b\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"us r&b\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a specific claim about F Phyllis Nelson's singles and their chart performances is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"only 1 of f phyllis nelson 's single , don' t stop the train make it to the us dance chart , but not the us hot 100 or us r&b\". The key points here are:\n\n1. F Phyllis Nelson has only one single that made it to the US Dance chart.\n2. That single is \"Don't Stop the Train\".\n3. This single did NOT make it to the US Hot 100 or the US R&B charts.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table provided to see which rows are relevant. The table has five rows with information about singles released in different years along with their chart positions and album details.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- **Row 1 (1981):** Single is \"Don't Stop the Train\". US Hot 100: -, US Dance: 20, US R&B: -. Album: move closer.\n  \n  So here, \"Don't Stop the Train\" did make it to the US Dance chart at position 20 but didn't chart on US Hot 100 or US R&B.\n\n- **Row 2 (1985):** Single is \"move closer\". All charts are marked as '-', meaning it didn't chart in any of these categories. So this single isn't relevant for the claim since it's about a different song and doesn't make it to any chart mentioned.\n\n- **Row 3 (1985):** Single is \"I Don't Know\". US Hot 100: 61, US Dance: 1, US R&B: 65. So this single made it to all three charts. The claim states that only one single (\"Don't Stop the Train\") made it to the dance chart but not the other two. This row contradicts the claim because another single did make it to the dance chart and also to the other charts.\n\n- **Row 4 (1985):** Single is \"I Like You\". US Hot 100: 61, US Dance: 1, US R&B: 65. Similar to row 3, this single also made it to all three charts, further contradicting the claim.\n\n- **Row 5 (1994):** Single is \"move closer\" again but as a reissue. All chart entries are '-', so it didn't chart in any of these categories. Irrelevant for the claim.\n\nPutting this together: The claim states that only one single (\"Don't Stop the Train\") made it to the US Dance chart without appearing on the other two charts. However, from rows 3 and 4, we see that \"I Don't Know\" and \"I Like You\" both appeared on all three charts (including US Dance). Therefore, there are more than one single by F Phyllis Nelson that made it to the dance chart, which directly contradicts the claim.\n\nSo, the relevant cells for this analysis are:\n\n- For Row 1: Checking if \"Don't Stop the Train\" made it to the dance chart and not the others.\n- For Rows 3 and 4: Checking other singles and their chart performances to see if they also appeared on the dance chart.\n\nSince additional singles did make it to the US Dance chart, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says, \"Phyllis Nelson be able to make the US Hot 100 list a total of 4 times.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is about. It's about Phyllis Nelson and her appearances on the US Hot 100 chart. She should have been on that chart four times according to the claim.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice there are five rows with various singles and their rankings in different charts like US Hot 100, US Dance, and US R&B. The years range from 1981 to 1994. Each row corresponds to a specific single and its performance across these charts.\n\nI need to check each row to see which ones have Phyllis Nelson's singles on the US Hot 100 chart. Wait, but in the table provided, I don't see any mention of \"Phyllis Nelson.\" The rows list singles like \"don'nt stop the train,\" \"move closer,\" etc., and their respective rankings. There's no explicit mention of the artist's name except for the album titles, which might be associated with her.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe all these entries are by Phyllis Nelson since she is making claims about them. The claim is about her ability to make the US Hot 100 list four times, so each row where \"us hot 100\" has a number indicates that her single charted on that list.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: us hot 100 is \"-\", which I assume means it didn't chart or wasn't listed. So no.\n- Row 2: us hot 100 is \"-\", so same as above.\n- Row 3: us hot 100 is 61, which is a position on the chart.\n- Row 4: us hot 100 is 61 again.\n- Row 5: us hot 100 is \"-\" again.\n\nSo rows 3 and 4 show US Hot 100 rankings of 61 each. That's two times she made it to the Hot 100 list, not four times as claimed. \n\nWait, but maybe I missed something? Let me double-check all the rows:\n\nRow 1: 1981, \"don't stop the train\" \u2013 US Hot 100 is \"-\", so no.\nRow 2: 1985, \"move closer\" \u2013 US Hot 100 is \"-\", so no.\nRow 3: 1985, \"i don't know\" \u2013 US Hot 100 is 61, yes.\nRow 4: 1985, \"i like you\" \u2013 US Hot 100 is 61, yes.\nRow 5: 1994, \"move closer (re-issue)\" \u2013 US Hot 100 is \"-\", so no.\n\nSo only two instances where she charted on the US Hot 100. Therefore, the claim that she made it four times is false because only two of her singles appear on the Hot 100 list according to the table.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Phyllis Nelson's singles appeared on the US Hot 100 chart twice, not four times.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So the task is to determine whether the claim about Phyllis Nelson's chart placements is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim says: \"Out of the 7 chart placements achieved by Phyllis Nelson, 6 are in 1985.\" My goal is to check if this statement holds true using the data provided in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a single entry for a specific year and song. There are five rows here. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nRow 1: Year 1981, single \"don't stop the train.\" It has a us dance chart placement of 20. So that's one placement in 1981.\n\nRow 2: Year 1985, single \"move closer.\" All the chart placements are \"-\", which I assume means no placement here.\n\nRow 3: Also 1985, single \"i don't know.\" It has us hot 100 at 61, us dance at 1, and us r&b at 65. So that's three placements for this song in 1985.\n\nRow 4: Again, year 1985, single \"i like you.\" The chart placements are the same as row 3: hot 100 at 61, dance at 1, r&b at 65. So another three placements here.\n\nRow 5: Year 1994, single \"move closer (re-issue).\" All chart placements are \"-\", so no placement in this year.\n\nNow, let's tally up the total chart placements. From row 1, we have one. In 1985, rows 3 and 4 each contribute three placements, making six. So in total, that's seven placements across all years: one in 1981 and six in 1985.\n\nWait a second, the claim says \"out of the 7 chart placements achieved by Phyllis Nelson.\" But looking at the data, I can see there are only five rows. However, each row with multiple chart entries counts as separate placements. So for example, row 3 has three different charts, so that's three placements for one song in 1985.\n\nSo adding them up: Row 1 (1981) gives us 1 placement. Rows 3 and 4 (both 1985) give us 3 + 3 = 6 placements. That makes a total of seven chart placements, with six of them occurring in 1985.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct because out of her seven chart placements, six are indeed from 1985.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_implicit\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_implicit\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_implicit\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_implicit\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_implicit\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nWait, the user wants row indices as per their table. Let me adjust.\n\nThe relevant rows are all five rows because each has a year and chart placements that contribute to the count.\n\nSo corrected JSON:\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nBut in the initial analysis, rows 0 and 1 are from 1981 and 1985 respectively. Wait no:\n\nLooking back, row indices start at 0.\n\nRow 0: 1981\nRow 1: 1985\nRow 2: 1985\nRow 3: 1985\nRow 4: 1994\n\nSo rows 0 (1981) and rows 1,2,3 (1985), row 4 (1994). So the relevant cells for the claim are all rows' year and their chart placements.\n\nBut to count placements, I need to look at each chart column where it's not \"-\". \n\nSo more precisely:\n\nFrom the table:\n\nRow 0: us_dance is 20 \u2192 one placement.\n\nRow 1: all charts \"-\" \u2192 no placement.\n\nRow 2: hot_100=61, dance=1, r&b=65 \u2192 three placements.\n\nRow3: same as row2 \u2192 another three.\n\nRow4: all \"-\" \u2192 none.\n\nSo in total: 1 + 3 +3 =7. Six of them (rows 2 and 3) are from 1985.\n\nHence, the relevant cells include all rows because each contributes to the count or not. But specifically, for the claim's verification, we look at which years have chart placements.\n\nSo the answer is TRUE because out of seven placements (one in 1981 and six in 1985), six are in 1985.\n\nFinal JSON:\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nWait no. Wait the user wants all cells relevant to verify the claim. So for each placement, I need to check which year they are in.\n\nSo perhaps, every row where any chart is not \"-\" is relevant because it contributes to the count of placements and their respective years.\n\nThus, rows 0 (dance=20), 2 (all three charts), and 3 (same as 2) have placements. So their rows are relevant for checking which year they belong to.\n\nSo:\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nBut the initial claim is about all seven placements across all years. Wait no: the table has only five rows but multiple chart entries.\n\nWait perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me list each placement with its row and column:\n\nRow0: dance=20 \u2192 year 1981\n\nRow2: hot_100, dance, r&b \u2192 three placements in 1985\n\nRow3: same as row2 \u2192 another three in 1985.\n\nSo total seven placements: one in 1981 and six in 1985.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For row0: dance=20 (to count it) and year=1981.\n\nBut since we're only checking which years have how many placements, perhaps all rows where any chart is non-zero. So rows0,2,3.\n\nSo their 'year' columns are the ones relevant to verify that six of seven placements are in 1985.\n\nHence:\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nBut perhaps the user expects all rows that contribute to placements. So also need to include the chart columns where they have values.\n\nAlternatively, since the claim is about the count across years, we can focus on which years had placements.\n\nThus, the answer should be TRUE and the relevant cells are the 'year' in row0 (1981), rows2 and 3 (both 1985). But I think it's better to include all the chart columns as well because they show whether there was a placement or not.\n\nWait, perhaps more precise:\n\nTo determine how many placements each year has, we need to look at all non \"-\" entries in all charts across all rows and note their years. Thus, for each row, if any chart is non \"-\", that's a placement in the year of that row.\n\nSo the relevant cells are all (year, chart) where chart is not \"-\".\n\nHence:\n\nRow0: dance=20 \u2192 so cell (0, \"dance\")\n\nRows2 and 3 have three charts each. So for rows2 and 3, all three charts are non \"-\", thus their years.\n\nThus, the relevant cells include these placements and their respective years.\n\nBut in the JSON format, we need to list row indices and column names where the data is relevant.\n\nTherefore:\n\nRow0: dance=20 \u2192 so column \"dance\" and year \"year\"\n\nSimilarly, for rows 2 and3, columns hot_100, dance, r&b are non \"-\", each contributing a placement in 1985.\n\nSo including all these cells would be necessary to verify the count. However, perhaps it's better to just include the years for these placements as that is what matters for the claim.\n\nAlternatively, since the user wants \"relevant_cells\" that directly contribute to verifying the answer, we can list each placement's year. So for row0, dance=20 \u2192 cell (0,\"year\"). For rows2 and3, any of their chart columns would indicate a placement in 1985. Thus, perhaps including all these.\n\nBut it might be complex. To simplify, given that the claim is about the count per year, we can consider each row where there's at least one non \"-\" chart as contributing to the count for its year. So rows0 (dance),2 and3 (all three charts). Thus, their 'year' columns are relevant.\n\nHence:\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nBut wait, row1 has year=1985 but all charts \"-\", so it doesn't contribute any placements. So including its 'year' is not necessary for the count.\n\nThus, in conclusion, the answer is TRUE and the relevant cells are those rows where there's a placement (rows0,2,3) showing their years as 1981 and 1985 respectively.\n\nSo final JSON:\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}",

The table has several rows with data for different years, singles, their ranks in US Hot 100, US Dance, and US R&B charts, as well as the album they belong to.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n- **Row 1**: This entry is from 1981. The single is \"don't stop the train.\" It doesn't have a rank in US Hot 100 or US Dance but has an album titled \"move closer.\" However, this isn't the single we're looking for.\n\n- **Row 2**: Year 1985, single \"move closer,\" no rankings mentioned for any chart. So, it's unclear if this was a hit in any category.\n\n- **Row 3 and Row 4**: Both are from 1985. The singles here are \"i don't know\" and \"i like you.\" For both these singles, the US Dance rank is listed as 1. This suggests that these songs reached number 1 on the US Dance chart.\n\n- **Row 5**: This is a re-issue of \"move closer\" from 1994, but again, there's no ranking information provided for any chart here.\n\nNow, focusing back on the claim: it mentions both \"move closer\" and \"i like you.\" From the table, I can see that \"i like you\" indeed has a US Dance rank of 1 in Row 4. However, looking at \"move closer,\" only Rows 2 and 5 mention this single, but neither provides a US Dance ranking. Since there's no data indicating that \"move closer\" was number 1 on the US Dance chart, the claim isn't fully supported.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because while \"i like you\" did reach number 1 in US Dance, \"move closer\" didn't have a listed rank of 1 in that category.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"don't stop the train, record in 1985 never hit the us dance list\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's stating. The claim mentions a specific single, \"don't stop the train,\" and claims that its recording in 1985 did not make it onto the US Dance chart (us dance list). So, my task is to verify if this statement holds true according to the data provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different record with details about the year, single title, various chart positions, and album. I need to identify the rows that correspond to \"don't stop the train\" from 1985 because the claim is specifically about that recording in that year.\n\nStarting with Row 1: Year is 1981, so this isn't relevant since we're looking for records from 1985. The single here is indeed \"don' t stop the train,\" but it's from 1981. However, the claim refers to 1985, so I can disregard Row 1.\n\nNext, Rows 2 through 4 are all from 1985. Let's check each of these:\n\n- **Row 2**: Single is \"move closer.\" The us dance column here is \"-\", which means it didn't chart or isn't listed in the US Dance chart for that year.\n- **Row 3 and Row 4**: These have singles \"i don' t know\" and \"i like you,\" respectively. Neither of these are \"don't stop the train,\" so they're not relevant to our claim.\n\nWait, but looking back at the table, I notice that in Row 1, the single is \"don' t stop the train,\" but it's from 1981. The other rows for 1985 don't mention this song again except in Row 2 as \"move closer.\" Hmm, does that mean \"don't stop the train\" was only released once in 1981? Or is there another entry in 1985?\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a row. Let me double-check:\n\n- **Row 5**: This is from 1994, so it's after the year in question (1985). The single here is \"move closer\" again but as a re-issue.\n\nSo, based on this, the only entry for \"don't stop the train\" is in Row 1, which is from 1981. There are no entries for that song in 1985. Therefore, any claim about its performance in 1985 isn't directly supported by data because it wasn't released then.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The claim says \"record in 1985,\" so perhaps the single was re-released or mentioned in 1985? But looking at the table, Row 2's album is \"move closer\" and the single is \"move closer.\" There's no mention of \"don't stop the train\" being released again in 1985. So, if there's no entry for that song in 1985, how can we evaluate its us dance chart performance?\n\nIn such cases, absence of data doesn't necessarily mean it didn't hit the charts; perhaps it just wasn't included in this table. But since our only source is this table, and it shows no entries for \"don't stop the train\" in 1985, we can infer that either it wasn't released then or its chart performance isn't recorded here.\n\nBut the claim specifically states that the record (the song) from 1985 never hit the us dance list. Since there's no entry for this song in 1985, does that mean it didn't release that year? Or is it possible that it was released but just didn't chart?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"don't stop the train\" refers to an album or another single. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at Row 2: Single is \"move closer,\" and the album is also \"move closer.\" Rows 3 and 4 have singles with different titles. So, \"don't stop the train\" only appears in Row 1.\n\nTherefore, according to this table, \"don't stop the train\" was released in 1981, not in 1985. Hence, any claim about its performance in 1985 is irrelevant because it wasn't a release that year. So, if there's no data for 1985, can we say whether it hit or didn't hit the us dance chart? Since the table doesn't list it, but the claim is about a record from 1985, which isn't in the table.\n\nWait, maybe I misread Row 2. The single there is \"move closer,\" and the album is also \"move closer.\" There's no mention of \"don't stop the train\" again except in Row 1 as part of that album.\n\nSo, perhaps the claim is incorrect because \"don't stop the train\" was released in 1981, not 1985. Therefore, when the claim says \"record in 1985,\" it's referring to a song that wasn't released that year according to the table. So, since there's no record of it being on the us dance chart in 1985 (because it wasn't released then), does that make the claim true?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"don't stop the train\" was part of an album from 1985? Let me check Row 2: The album is \"move closer,\" and the single is also \"move closer.\" There's no mention of \"don't stop the train\" in any other rows except Row 1.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the claim is TRUE because there's no data indicating that \"don't stop the train\" was released or charted in 1985. The table doesn't list it as a single in 1985, so we can infer that it didn't hit the us dance list that year.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"don't stop the train,\" recorded in 1985, never appeared on the US Dance chart. Checking the table:\n\n- The only entry for \"don't stop the train\" is from 1981 (Row 1), which doesn't provide data for 1985.\n- No other rows mention this song in 1985.\n\nThus, there's no evidence to support that it charted on US Dance in 1985. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"single\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"in 1985, phyllis nelson be able to chart 2 time with her song.\" \n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It says that in 1985, Phyllis Nelson was able to have two songs charting. So I'm looking for entries in the table from 1985 where singles are charted.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 2: Year is 1985, single is \"move closer\". The US Hot 100 is '-', so it didn't chart there. US Dance and R&B are also '-'. So this song doesn't have any charting info in these categories.\n\nRows 3 and 4: Both have year 1985, singles \"i don't know\" and \"i like you\". For both, the US Hot 100 is 61, which means they did chart. Also, their US Dance positions are 1 each, which is a strong charting position. So these two songs definitely charted.\n\nRow 5: Year is 1994, so it's outside our consideration for this claim.\n\nSo in 1985, there are three rows (rows 2,3,4) but only rows 3 and 4 have singles that charted. So that's two songs charting in 1985 by Phyllis Nelson.\n\nWait, the table doesn't mention Phyllis Nelson anywhere, so I'm assuming that she is associated with these singles based on context. The problem might be that we don't know her name from the table, but perhaps it's implied or given elsewhere.\n\nSo according to the data in the table, two songs charted in 1985: \"i don't know\" and \"i like you\". Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"single\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"single\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about Phyllis Nelson's singles is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding the claim and then cross-verifying it against the data in the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"Phyllis Nelson be unable to hit the US Hot 100 and US Dance chart for both I like you, as well as Don't stop the train.\" So, Phyllis Nelson is claiming that her singles \"I Like You\" and \"Don't Stop the Train\" didn't make it onto the US Hot 100 or US Dance charts.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nRow 1: Year 1981, single \"Don't Stop the Train\". The US Hot 100 is '-', which I think means it didn't chart. US Dance is 20, so it did chart on the dance chart. \n\nRow 3 and Row 4: Both are from 1985 for singles \"I Don't Know\" and \"I Like You\". For \"I Don't Know\", US Hot 100 is 61, which means it charted there. US Dance is 1, so top of the dance charts. Similarly, \"I Like You\" has the same rankings.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions both singles by Phyllis Nelson: \"Don't Stop the Train\" and \"I Like You.\" The first single didn't hit Hot 100 (as '-') but did chart on US Dance at position 20. So, it did make it to the dance chart. \n\nThe second part of the claim is about \"I Like You\". Looking at Rows 3 and 4: \"I Don't Know\" is in Row 3 with Hot 100 as 61 and Dance as 1. \"I Like You\" in Row 4 has the same numbers, so it did chart on both.\n\nWait a minute, but the claim says that Phyllis was unable to hit both US Hot 100 and US Dance for both singles. But according to the table, \"Don't Stop the Train\" didn't make Hot 100 (it's '-') but did make US Dance at 20. So it made one of them.\n\nThen \"I Like You\" in Row 4: US Hot 100 is 61 and Dance is 1. So both charts were hit for that single.\n\nWait, so the claim says she was unable to hit both charts for both singles. But in reality:\n\n- \"Don't Stop the Train\": Didn't hit Hot 100 but did hit Dance.\n- \"I Like You\": Hit both Hot 100 and Dance.\n\nSo, she was able to hit at least one chart for each single. For \"Don't Stop,\" it's on Dance; for \"I Like You,\" both charts. Therefore, the claim is that she couldn't hit both charts for both singles. But since for \"I Like You\" she did hit both, the claim isn't fully accurate.\n\nWait no, let me read the claim again: \"be unable to hit the US Hot 100 and US Dance chart for both I like you, as well as don' t stop the train.\" So, it's saying that for both singles (I Like You and Don't Stop), she couldn't hit either of those charts.\n\nBut in reality:\n\n- For \"Don't Stop,\" she did hit US Dance.\n- For \"I Like You,\" she hit both.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because at least one chart was hit for each single, and even more so for \"I Like You.\" Therefore, the claim should be FALSE.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check:\n\nThe claim says that she couldn't hit either US Hot 100 or US Dance for both singles. So, for both singles, neither chart was reached. But according to the table:\n\n- \"Don't Stop\": Did not reach US Hot 100 (it's '-') but did reach US Dance at 20.\n- \"I Like You\": Reached both charts.\n\nSo she actually did hit some charts for each single, meaning her inability to hit both charts for both singles is false because she did hit some charts for each. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let's clarify:\n\nThe claim could be interpreted as she couldn't get either chart for both singles. So, neither \"I Like You\" nor \"Don't Stop\" made it onto either Hot 100 or Dance charts. But that's not the case because \"Don't Stop\" did make Dance, and \"I Like You\" made both.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps she couldn't get both charts for each single. So for each song, neither chart was hit. But again, \"Don't Stop\" hit Dance, so that's a hit on one chart; \"I Like You\" hit both.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because at least one of the charts was hit for both singles, and one of them hit both.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
