    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"in Stanley the bridge be of the concrete deck girder style\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It states that in the location called Stanley, there's a bridge that has the type 'concrete deck girder'. So my goal is to check if any row in the table matches both the location 'Stanley' and the type 'concrete deck girder'.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan each row for the location column. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nRow 1: Location Finley - not Stanley.\nRow 2: Caledonia - nope.\nRow 3: Haynes - no.\nRow 4: Lisbon - no.\nRow 5: Crystal - no.\nRow 6: Minot - no.\nRow 7: Towner - no.\nRow 8: Cartwright - no.\nRow 9: Grace City - no.\nRow 10: Stanley! Okay, this is the location we're looking for. Now I need to check its type.\n\nLooking at row 10's Type column: It says 'concrete deck girder bridge'. Wait, does that match exactly with what the claim said? The claim mentions 'concrete deck girder style', which seems similar but not identical in wording. However, 'style' here likely refers to the type of bridge.\n\nSo the type is indeed 'concrete deck girder bridge' for Stanley's location. That matches the claim, so it should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells. The row index for Stanley is 9 (since counting starts at 0) and the columns are Location and Type.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in rows 10 of the table, specifically the Location and Type columns. Therefore, the answer is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"in colton 's cross the bridge be a pratt through truss bridge\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It seems like it's referring to a specific bridge named \"colton's crossing bridge.\" The claim states that this bridge is a \"pratt through truss\" type.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has details about different bridges, including their names and types. My task is to find the row where the name matches \"colton's crossing bridge\" and then check its type.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- Row 1: Beaver Creek Bridge\n- Row 2: Caledonia Bridge\n- Row 3: Cedar Creek Bridge\n- Row 4: Colton 's Crossing Bridge \u2013 this matches the name in the claim.\n  \nNow, checking Row 4's details:\n- Name: colton 's crossing bridge\n- Type: pratt through truss\n\nThe type exactly matches what the claim states. So according to the table, this bridge is indeed a pratt through truss bridge.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows mentioning Colton's Crossing Bridge to ensure there's no confusion or duplication, but scanning through the remaining rows (5-31), I don't see another entry with that name. \n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking Row 4 where the bridge name and type match exactly.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break down the steps.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"the westgaard bridge be in the style of a pratt pony through truss bridge.\" So, I'm looking for two specific pieces of information in the table: the name of the bridge and its type.\n\nI'll scan through each row to find any entry where the name is 'westgaard bridge'. Looking at the rows:\n\n- Row 25 has \"name: westgaard bridge\". That's a match. Now, checking the type column for this row, it says \"pratt pony through truss.\" \n\nWait, but the claim mentions \"pratt pony through truss bridge.\" The table entry includes an extra word 'bridge' at the end. Does that matter? I think in terms of classification, whether it's called a 'pratt pony through truss' or 'pratt pony through truss bridge', the key part is the style. So the type matches what the claim is saying.\n\nAdditionally, I'll double-check if there are any other entries with 'westgaard bridge'. Looking quickly through the rest of the rows, I don't see another one. So Row 25 is the only relevant row.\n\nNow, compiling the relevant cells. The name is in column \"name\" at row 25, and the type is in column \"type\" at the same row. Therefore, both these cells are necessary to support the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe Westgaard Bridge's name and type match the claim exactly, confirming it is a Pratt Pony Through Truss bridge.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim correctly. The user wrote it as \"cooper town be famous for the blanchard bridge.\" It seems like there might be a typo here. Maybe they meant \"Cooperstown\" instead of \"cooper town\"? Because looking at the table, I see a row where the name is \"romness bridge,\" listed on 1997-02-27, located in Cooperstown, county Griggs, type pratt through truss. So that's row 20.\n\nNow, the claim mentions \"Blanchard Bridge.\" Let me check if there's a Blanchard Bridge in the table. Scanning through, I see row 26: name is blanchard bridge, listed on 1997-02-27 and removed on 2009-3-25, located in blanchard, county traill, type pratt through truss.\n\nWait a minute. The claim says Cooperstown is famous for Blanchard Bridge. But according to the table, romness bridge is in Cooperstown (row 20), and blanchard bridge is in Blanchard (row 26). So, are these two different places? Yes, because row 26's location is blanchard, which is a different town than cooperstown.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Cooperstown is famous for the Blanchard Bridge doesn't hold true based on the information provided. The relevant cells would be the ones pointing to Cooperstown and the ones pointing to Blanchard Bridge.\n\nSo, I'll note down the relevant rows: row 20 (romness bridge in Cooperstown) and row 26 (blanchard bridge in Blanchard). Thus, the claim is FALSE because the two are not connected as per the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Cooperstown is famous for the Blanchard Bridge.

Let's break down the claim: \"mcville have goose river bridge which be currently under construction due to structural issue.\"\n\nFirst, let's parse the components of the claim:\n1. The location is mcville.\n2. There's a bridge named Goose River Bridge in mcville.\n3. This bridge is currently under construction because of structural issues.\n\nNow, I'll check each part against the table data.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for entries related to mcville and Goose River Bridge.\n\nFrom row 26: blanchard bridge, located in blanchard, county traill, type pratt through truss. It was listed on 1997-02-27 but removed on 2009-03-25. So this is about blanchard, not mcville.\n\nLooking for mcville: row 14 is midway bridge in johnstown, not mcville. Wait, looking again... actually, I think I need to check all rows for mcville. \n\nWait, let me scan through each row:\n\nRow 25: name mcville? No, it's about mcville? Let me see. Looking at the names and locations:\n\n- Row 14: midway bridge in johnstown\n- Row 26: blanchard bridge in blanchard\n- Row 27: goose river bridge in hillsboro (location is hillsboro)\nWait, row 27 mentions goose river bridge, located in hillsboro, county traill. It was listed on 1997-02-27 and removed on 2009-03-25.\n\nSo, the Goose River Bridge is in hillsboro, not mcville. Also, it's already removed, so currently under construction? No, it's been removed.\n\nNow, checking if any bridge in mcville exists:\n\nLooking through all rows for location 'mcville'. I don't see any entry where the location is mcville except row 26 and 27 mention blanchard and hillsboro respectively. So mcville isn't listed as a location in the table at all.\n\nAdditionally, checking if there's a bridge named Goose River Bridge elsewhere:\n\nRow 27: goose river bridge, but it's in hillsboro, not mcville. And it was removed in 2009. So no current construction there either.\n\nTherefore, the claim states that mcville has a Goose River Bridge currently under construction due to structural issues, but according to the table:\n\n- No entry for mcville as a location.\n- The Goose River Bridge is located in hillsboro and was removed in 2009.\n\nHence, the claim isn't supported by the data. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells would include rows where location is mcville or name is goose river bridge. Since there are no such entries for mcville, but row 27 mentions goose river bridge, which doesn't match mcville and also was removed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the grace city bridge be a concrete deck girder bridge in stanley\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the key elements of the claim: the name of the bridge is \"grace city bridge\", its type should be \"concrete deck girder bridge\", and its location is \"stanley\". \n\nI'll go through each row in the table to find where \"grace city bridge\" is listed. Scanning through, I see that Row 9 mentions \"grace city bridge\". Let me check the details there.\n\nIn Row 9: \n- Name: grace city bridge\n- Listed: 1997-02-27\n- Location: grace city\n- County: foster\n- Type: pratt through truss\n\nSo, according to this row, the location is \"grace city\", not \"stanley\". The type is \"pratt through truss\" as well. \n\nNow, I need to check if there's another bridge named \"grace city bridge\" elsewhere or if any other bridges are in \"Stanley\". Looking at Row 24: \n- Name: west park bridge\n- Location: valley city\nWait, no, that's not Stanley either.\n\nLooking through the table again, I see Row 24 is about west park bridge in valley city. Hmm. Wait, maybe I misread another row. Let me check Row 23:\n- Name: west antelope bridge\n- Location: flora\n\nNope. How about Row 25: westgaard bridge in voltaire. Still not Stanley.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, Row 24 is \"west park bridge\" with location \"valley city\". I must have misread that earlier. So, perhaps there's no bridge named \"grace city bridge\" located in Stanley. \n\nBut let me double-check all rows for any mention of \"Stanley\". Scanning the Location column, Row 24 is \"valley city\", and another row... Wait, Row 10: name is \"viking bridge\", location is portland.\n\nWait a second, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. The claim says \"grace city bridge be a concrete deck girder bridge in stanley\". \n\nLooking at the table, grace city bridge is in grace city (Row 9), not Stanley. So that's one discrepancy. Additionally, its type is pratt through truss, not concrete deck girder.\n\nIs there another row where location is Stanley? Let me check each row:\n\nRow 0: name is blanchard bridge? No.\nRow1: Goose river bridge in hillsboro\nRow2: liberty memorial bridge in bismarck\nRow3: porter elliott bridge in hillsboro\nRow4: portland park bridge (removed)\nRow5: rainbow arch bridge in valley city\n...\nWait, going back up:\n\nRow0: blanchard bridge in blanchard\nRow1: goose river bridge in hillsboro\nRow2: liberty memorial bridge in bismarck\nRow3: porter elliott bridge in hillsboro\nRow4: portland park bridge (removed)\nRow5: rainbow arch bridge in valley city\nRow6: Not sure, but I think I went through all. It seems no bridge is located in Stanley except maybe one.\n\nWait, looking at Row 24 again: west park bridge, location is valley city. Wait, did I miss a row where the location is Stanley? Let me scan for \"Stanley\" in the Location column.\n\nLooking carefully:\n\nRow9: grace city\nRow10: viking bridge in portland\nRow11: west antelope bridge in flora\nRow12: west park bridge in valley city\nRow13: westgaard bridge in voltaire\nRow14: blanchard bridge (removed)\nRow15: goose river bridge (removed)\nRow16: liberty memorial bridge (removed)\nRow17: porter elliott bridge (removed)\nRow18: portland park bridge (removed)\nRow19: rainbow arch bridge in valley city\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me recount the rows:\n\nRows are from 0 to 30.\n\nLooking again for \"Stanley\" in Location column: Nope, seems none of the bridges have Stanley as their location. The closest is Row24: west park bridge in valley city.\n\nSo, according to the table, there's no bridge named grace city bridge located in Stanley. Additionally, even if there were a bridge in Stanley, it wouldn't be a concrete deck girder bridge because the type doesn't match either.\n\nWait, let me check another row just in case. Row24: west park bridge is a concrete false arch bridge, but its location is valley city. So that's not it either.\n\nSo both conditions fail: the grace city bridge isn't located in Stanley and isn't a concrete deck girder bridge.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"grace city bridge\" is a \"concrete deck girder bridge in stanley\". Checking the table, Row 9 shows \"grace city bridge\" is located in \"grace city\" with type \"pratt through truss\", not in Stanley or of the specified type. No other row lists a bridge named \"grace city bridge\" or located in Stanley.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Type\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It states two things about colton's crossing bridge: that it is a Pratt Through Truss and located in Adam County.\n\nI'll start by searching for \"colton's crossing bridge\" in the table. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 4 mentions \"colton 's crossing bridge\". So, this is the relevant row.\n\nLooking at Row 4 details:\n- Name: colton 's crossing bridge\n- Listed date: 1997-02-27\n- Location: lisbon\n- County: ransom\n- Type: pratt through truss\n\nNow, checking each part of the claim:\n\n1. **Type**: The type is \"pratt through truss\" which matches the claim. So that's correct.\n\n2. **County**: The county listed is \"ransom\", not \"adam\". There's no mention of Adam County here. In fact, looking at all rows, I don't see any bridge located in Adam County except for Row 3: Row 1 has \"benson\" county, which is different from Adam.\n\nTherefore, while the type is correct, the county is wrong. The claim incorrectly states it's in Adam County when it's actually in Ransom County.\n\nHence, the claim isn't fully supported and should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly identifies the bridge as a Pratt Through Truss but incorrectly lists the county. It should be Ransom County, not Adam County.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"county\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the westgaard bridge be a pratt pony through truss bridge in traill county\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to locate the row for Westgaard Bridge in the table. Looking at the rows provided, I see that Row 25 is named \"westgaard bridge.\" Okay, so let's check the details there.\n\nThe claim states two things: the type of the bridge and its county. The type mentioned is \"pratt pony through truss bridge,\" and the county is \"traill.\"\n\nLooking at Row 25:\n- Name: westgaard bridge\n- Listed date: 1997-02-27\n- Location: voltaire\n- County: mchenry\n- Type: pratt pony through truss\n\nWait a minute, according to this row, the county is listed as \"mchenry,\" not \"traill.\" The type matches\u2014\"pratt pony through truss bridge\"\u2014but the county doesn't. \n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything else. Maybe there's another row with Westgaard Bridge? Scanning through all 31 rows, Row 25 is the only one mentioning \"westgaard bridge.\" There are other bridges in Traill County, like Row 22: viking bridge, and others, but none of them mention Westgaard.\n\nSo, based on this, the claim about the county being Traill is incorrect. The bridge is actually in McHenry County. Therefore, the entire statement isn't fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states the county as Traill instead of McHenry for the Westgaard Bridge.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"county\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
