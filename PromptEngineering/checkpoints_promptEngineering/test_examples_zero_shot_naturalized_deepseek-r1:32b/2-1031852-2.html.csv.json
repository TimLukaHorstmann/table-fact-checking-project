    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"kansas city have no post-season record in 2013\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"kansas city.\" Looking at the table, the relevant column is \"mlb affiliate,\" which shows the team's major league affiliate. I need to find the row where the mlb affiliate is \"kansas city\" and check if it corresponds to 2013.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Row 1 (2001): Houston\n- Row 2 (2002): Houston\n- ...\n- Row 13 (2013): Kansas City\n\nSo, row 13 is the one with mlb affiliate as \"kansas city.\" Now, checking the post-season record for that year. The columns relevant are \"post - season record\" and \"post - season win %.\"\n\nIn row 13, both \"post - season record\" and \"post - season win %\" have a dash (\"-\"), which typically indicates no data or not applicable. So, there's no post-season record listed for Kansas City in 2013.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there's no post-season data available for that team in that year.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"kansas city have no post - season record in 2013.\" By examining row 13 of the table, which corresponds to the 2013 season with the mlb affiliate as Kansas City, both the \"post - season record\" and \"post - season win %\" columns show a dash (\"-\"). This indicates that there is no post-season data for that year.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"mlb affiliate\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether the claim \"houston have no post-season record\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The subject here is \"houston,\" and the predicate is about having \"no post-season record.\" So, essentially, we're checking if Houston didn't participate in any post-season games during their listed seasons, or if they don't have any records from post-season play.\n\nLooking at the table structure: each row represents a season from 2001 to 2013. Each row has columns like 'season', 'manager', 'record', 'win %', 'post-season record', 'post-season win %', and 'mlb affiliate'. \n\nThe claim is about Houston's post-season records, so I should focus on the 'post-season record' column for rows where the 'mlb affiliate' is Houston.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Season 2001, mlb affiliate Houston. Post-season record is 4-0. So they did have a post-season and won all their games.\n\nRow 2: 2002, Houston again. Post-season record is '-', which might mean no post-season play or data not available. But since the claim says \"no post-season record,\" having a '-' could be interpreted as having no record. However, we need to check other rows too.\n\nRows 3 and 6: Both have 'mlb affiliate' Houston. Row 3 (2003) has post-season record 0-2, which means they did participate in the post-season but lost both games. Similarly, Row 6 (2006) also has a post-season record of 0-2.\n\nRows beyond that: Rows 4 to 8 have Houston as affiliate but their post-season records are '-', meaning no post-season play or data not available. However, since we've already found rows where Houston had post-season records (like Row1, Row3, Row6), the claim would be FALSE because Houston does have some post-season records.\n\nWait, let me recheck. The claim says \"houston have no post-season record.\" So if any of their seasons have a post-season record (even just one), then the claim is false. Since Rows 1,3, and 6 show that they do have post-season records, the claim is FALSE.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because there are instances where Houston has post-season records.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"post-season record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"post-season record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"post-season record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
