    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the fullback ken snelling be pick 58 in round 7\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into its components:\n1. The player's name is Ken Snelling.\n2. His position is Fullback.\n3. He was picked in Round 7.\n4. His pick number is 58.\n\nNow, I'll look through each row of the table to find a match for these details.\n\nStarting from Row 1 and moving down:\n- Row 1: Dick Wildung, Tackle, Minnesota \u2013 Doesn't match.\n- Row 2: Irv Comp, Back, Benedictine \u2013 Position is Back but not Fullback. Pick number is 23, Round 3. Doesn't match.\n- Row 3: Roy McKay, Back, Texas \u2013 Again, position is Back, pick 38, Round 5. No match.\n- Row 4: Nick Susoeff, End, Washington State \u2013 Position doesn't match.\n- Row 5: Ken Snelling, Fullback, UCLA \u2013 Oh, this seems promising. Let's check the details here.\n\nLooking at Row 5:\n- Round: 7\n- Pick: 58\n- Player: Ken Snelling\n- Position: Fullback\n- School/Club Team: UCLA\n\nAll the details in the claim match exactly with what's in Row 5 of the table. The player is Ken Snelling, his position is Fullback, he was picked in Round 7, and the pick number is indeed 58.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately reflects the information found in Row 5 of the table, confirming that Ken Snelling is a fullback picked at position 58 in round 7. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim about George Zellick is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. Each row represents a player with details like round, pick number, player name, position, and school/club team. The rows are numbered from 1 to 30, each corresponding to a different player.\n\nThe claim states: \"George Zellick have a position of end and a school / club of oregon state.\" I need to check if both these pieces of information match the data in the table.\n\nTo do this, I'll scan through the rows looking for George Zellick. Once found, I'll verify his position and school/club team.\n\nLooking at Row 24: It mentions George Zellick as a player with position 'end' and school/club team 'oregon state.' That seems to match exactly what the claim is stating.\n\nNow, let's double-check to ensure there are no other entries for George Zellick that might contradict this information. Scanning through all 30 rows, I don't see any other mention of George Zellick. Therefore, the data in Row 24 is the only relevant entry.\n\nSo both conditions in the claim are satisfied: position 'end' and school/club team 'oregon state.' This means the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells to support this conclusion are in Row 24 for the player name (to identify it's George Zellick), his position, and his school/club team.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"school  / club team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim about George Zellick is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the steps.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"george zellick have a position of center and a school / club of oregon state.\"\n\nI'll start by looking for any player named George Zellick in the table. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 24 mentions George Makris from Wisconsin as a guard.\n- Row 15 has Ron Thomas, also not him.\n- Then I see row 23: \"george zellick\" is listed here.\n\nSo, checking row 23:\n- Position is end, not center.\n- School/club team is Oregon State, which matches part of the claim.\n\nThe claim says George Zellick's position is center. But according to the table, his position is end. Therefore, this part is incorrect.\n\nNext, the school/club team in the claim is Oregon State, which does match the table entry for George Zellick.\n\nHowever, since the position doesn't align (it's end instead of center), the entire claim isn't fully accurate.\n\nSo, the claim has two parts: position and school. One part matches, but the other doesn't. Therefore, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells are:\n- Position in row 23\n- School/club team in row 23\n\nI'll structure this into a JSON response as per instructions.\n</think>\n\nThe claim about George Zellick specifies his position and school. Checking the table:\n\n1. **Position**: In row 24, George Zellick's position is listed as \"end,\" not \"center.\"\n2. **School/Club Team**: His team is correctly noted as Oregon State.\n\nSince the position doesn't match, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"school  / club team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
