    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the montreal canadiens be the visitor on december 27 , 29 , and 30.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. It's saying that Montreal Canadiens were visitors on three specific dates: December 27, 29, and 30. So I need to check each of these dates in the table to see if Montreal was listed as the visitor.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a game with details like date, visitor team, home team, etc. The relevant columns here are 'date' and 'visitor'.\n\nLet me go through each date one by one:\n\n1. **December 27**: I'll search for this date in the 'date' column. From the table provided, row 11 has the date December 27. Checking the visitor column for this row, it says \"montreal canadiens.\" So on Dec 27, Montreal was indeed the visitor.\n\n2. **December 29**: Next, I'll check row 12 as the date is December 29. The visitor team in this row is also listed as \"montreal canadiens.\" So again, they were the visitors.\n\n3. **December 30**: Moving to row 13, which has the date December 30. Here, the visitor is again \"montreal canadiens.\"\n\nSince all three specified dates (27th, 29th, and 30th) show Montreal Canadiens as the visiting team, the claim holds true.\n\nI should also make sure that I'm not missing any other entries for these dates where Montreal might have been the home team. But from the table, each date corresponds to only one game, so there's no conflict here.\n\nTherefore, all conditions in the claim are supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because on December 27, 29, and 30, Montreal Canadiens were listed as visitors in their respective rows.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the montreal canadiens be the home team at least 5 times.\" Looking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, visitor, home team, etc.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row and check the 'home' column to see if Montreal Canadiens are listed as the home team. Let's count how many times they were the home team.\n\nRow 1: Home is Montreal Canadiens - that's one.\nRow 2: Again, home is Montreal Canadiens - two.\nRow 3: Still home for Montreal - three.\nRow 4: Home team is Montreal - four.\nRow 5: They're still at home - five.\nRow 6: Home again, so six.\nRows 7 and 8: In row 7, they're the visitor, not home. Row 8, back as home - seven.\nRow 9: Home again - eight.\nRow 10: Home once more - nine.\nRow 11: They're visitors here, so no count.\nSame for rows 12 and 13; they are visitors.\n\nWait, I think I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\nRows 1-6: Montreal is home each time, that's six times already. Rows 8 and 9 also have them as home. So from row 1 to row 6, plus rows 8,9,10. That would be more than five.\n\nWait, actually, rows 7 and 11-13 are when they're visitors.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user is asking whether the claim \"21273 crowd be in attendance for 9 of the game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim means. It seems like it's saying that there were 21,273 people attending 9 out of the total games listed in the table. So, my goal is to check how many times the attendance was exactly 21,273 across all rows.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, visitor team, score, home team, decision (likely the goalie), attendance, record, and points. The key column here is \"attendance\" which I'll focus on.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- Row 1: Attendance is 21273 \u2192 Yes.\n- Row 2: Same as above \u2192 Yes.\n- Row 3: Again same attendance \u2192 Yes.\n- Rows 4 to 6: Each has attendance of 21273 \u2192 All yes.\n- Row 7: Attendance drops to 16434 \u2192 No.\n- Rows 8 to 10: Back to 21273 each time \u2192 Yes.\n- Row 11: Attendance is 17132 \u2192 No.\n- Row 12: Attendance increases to 20741 \u2192 No.\n- Row 13: Attendance is 20454 \u2192 No.\n\nCounting the \"Yes\" instances, I have Rows 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10.

It says that a crowd size less than 21273 attended only 4 games out of all the games listed. So, I should check each row's attendance and count how many times the attendance was below 21273.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Attendance is 21273\nRow 2: 21273\nRow 3: 21273\nRow 4: 21273\nRow 5: 21273\nRow 6: 21273\nRow 7: 16434 (this is less than 21273)\nRow 8: 21273\nRow 9: 21273\nRow 10: 21273\nRow 11: 17132 (less)\nRow 12: 20741 (less)\nRow 13: 20454 (less)\n\nSo, I'll count the rows where attendance is less than 21273. That's Rows 7, 11, 12, and 13.

The claim says, \"the carolina hurricane be the visitor on december 27 , 29 , and 30.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each date mentioned in the claim: December 27, 29, and 30. For each of these dates, I need to check the 'visitor' column in the table to see if it's \"Carolina Hurricanes.\"\n\nStarting with December 27. Let me scan through the rows. Row 11 has the date December 27. The visitor for that row is \"Montreal Canadiens,\" not Carolina Hurricanes. So, that doesn't match.\n\nNext, December 29. Looking at Row 12, the date is December 29. The visitor here is again \"Montreal Canadiens.\" So, no luck there either.\n\nNow, December 30. Checking Row 13, which has the date December 30. Here, the visitor is also \"Montreal Canadiens.\" Wait a minute, that's three times where Carolina Hurricanes isn't visiting on those dates. \n\nWait, maybe I should double-check if I'm looking at the right rows.

But the claim says Carolina Hurricanes are visitors on those dates, so this row shows them as the home team, not visitors.\n\nContinuing:\n- Row 8: Dec 18 - Visitor: Philadelphia Flyers\n- Row 9: Dec 20 - Visitor: Buffalo Sabres\n- Row 10: Dec 21 - Visitor: Carolina Hurricanes (wait, here's a visitor on Dec 21. But the claim is about Dec 27,29,30.\n\nSo in the rows for Dec 27,29,30, the visitors are all Montreal Canadiens. Therefore, the claim that Carolina Hurricanes were visitors on those dates is incorrect because they weren't; instead, Montreal was visiting each time.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be the 'visitor' column for each of these three specific rows: December 27 (Row 11), December 29 (Row 12), and December 30 (Row 13). Each shows that the visitor is Montreal Canadiens, not Carolina Hurricanes.

It's stating that the Philadelphia Flyers were the home team at least five times in the given data. So, I'm looking for how many times the Flyers were listed as the home team.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"home\" column which indicates who was the home team on that date. The claim is about the Flyers being the home team, so I need to check each row's \"home\" value and count how often it's \"philadelphia flyers.\"\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Home is Montreal Canadiens.\n2. **Row 2**: Home is Montreal Canadiens.\n3. **Row 3**: Home is Montreal Canadiens.\n4. **Row 4**: Home is Montreal Canadiens.\n5. **Row 5**: Home is Montreal Canadiens.\n6. **Row 6**: Home is Montreal Canadiens.\n7. **Row 7**: Home is Carolina Hurricanes.\n8. **Row 8**: Home is Montreal Canadiens.\n9. **Row 9**: Home is Montreal Canadiens.\n10. **Row 10**: Home is Montreal Canadiens.\n11. **Row 11**: Home is Pittsburgh Penguins.\n12. **Row 12**: Home is Florida Panthers.\n13. **Row 13**: Home is Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\nWait a second, in all these rows, I don't see the Philadelphia Flyers as the home team once. They appear in row 8 as the visitor. So, the count of times they were the home team is zero.\n\nTherefore, the claim that they were the home team at least five times is FALSE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells: Since we're checking each \"home\" column to see if it's Philadelphia Flyers, I'll list all rows with the \"home\" column. But in reality, since none of them are Flyers as home, maybe only row 8 is when they appear, but that's as a visitor.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I need to include each relevant cell checked.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"over 40 point be score for at least 3 of the game.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse what this means. It seems like the claim is stating that in at least three games, the total points scored were over 40. Wait, actually, looking more carefully, maybe it's about each team scoring over 40 points? Or perhaps it's referring to the home team or visitor team having a score above 40. But wait, in hockey, scores are usually lower than that; typically, a game might have a combined total of around 6-10 goals. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim.\n\nWait, another interpretation: Maybe \"over 40 points\" refers to each team's points column. The table has a column named \"points,\" which likely represents the team's standings in terms of points earned from wins, losses, and ties. So perhaps the claim is that at least three games resulted in the home team (Montreal Canadiens) having over 40 points after those games.\n\nLooking back at the table, each row has a \"record\" column with wins, losses, and ties, followed by the \"points.\" For example, Row 1: record: 14-6-4, points:32. So each game played affects the team's points. The points are calculated as (wins * 2) + (ties * 1). \n\nThe claim is about whether over 40 points were scored in at least three games. Wait, that still doesn't make much sense because a single game contributes either 2 points for a win, 0 for a loss, or 1 for a tie to the team's total points.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps \"over 40 point\" refers to the combined score of both teams in each game? For example, if the home and visitor scores add up to over 40, but that would be extremely high for hockey games. Let me check some rows:\n\nRow 1: 4-5 (total 9)\nRow 2: 2-6 (8)\nRow 3: 2-1 OT (3)\nRow 4: 1-4 (5)\nRow 5: 3-1 (4)\nRow 6: 2-1 (3)\nRow 7: 2-3 (5)\nRow 8: 2-5 (7)\nRow 9: 3-4 OT (7)\nRow 10: 3-2 OT (5)\nRow 11: 3-2 (5)\nRow 12: 5-2 (7)\nRow 13: 2-1 SO (3)\n\nNone of these totals are over 40. So that can't be it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is about whether in at least three games, the team's points were over 40. Looking at the \"points\" column:\n\nRow 1: 32\nRow 2:34\nRow3:35\nRow4:37\nRow5:37\nRow6:37\nRow7:37\nRow8:39\nRow9:41\nRow10:42\nRow11:44\nRow12:46\nRow13:48\n\nLooking at the points, after which games did they exceed 40? Let's see:\n\n- Row9:41 (yes)\n- Row10:42\n- Row11:44\n- Row12:46\n- Row13:48\n\nSo from row 9 onwards, the points are over 40. How many rows is that? Rows 9,10,11,12,13\u2014so five games where the team's points were above 40.\n\nThe claim says \"at least three,\" so if we have five such instances, then it would be TRUE. But I need to make sure whether each of these rows corresponds to a game that contributed to their point total being over 40.\n\nWait, actually, the \"points\" column is cumulative. So each row shows the points after that game. Therefore, starting from Row9 onwards, the team has more than 40 points. How many games does it take for them to reach and stay above 40? Let's see:\n\nRow1:32\nRow2:34\nRow3:35\nRow4:37\nRow5:37 (same as before, so maybe a tie or loss)\nWait, but looking at the points, they go up from 32 to 34, then 35, then 37. Then in Row5, it's still 37, which suggests that game didn't add any points\u2014maybe a loss.\n\nThen Row6 is also 37, so another loss or tie. Then Row7: still 37. So perhaps Row8 they got to 39, then Row9 jumps to 41, meaning they earned two points in that game (a win). From there on, their points increase each time.\n\nSo from Row9 onwards, the team has over 40 points. That's five games: rows 9,10,11,12,13. Therefore, at least three games meet the condition of having points over 40. Thus, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because in five games (rows 9 to 13), the team's cumulative points exceed 40.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"16434 crowd be in attendance for 9 of the game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It says that there was an attendance of 16,434 people at 9 of the games listed in the table. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with various details including the date, visitor team, score, home team, decision-maker (likely the goalie), attendance, record, and points.\n\nI need to check the 'attendance' column for each row to see how many times 16434 appears. \n\nLooking at Row 7: The attendance is listed as 16434. That's one occurrence.\n\nNow, checking all other rows from 1 to 13, I don't see any other instances where the attendance is exactly 16,434. Most of them have either 21273 or other numbers like 17132 and 20741.\n\nTherefore, only one game had an attendance of 16,434, not nine games as claimed. So the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there were 9 games with an attendance of 16,434. However, upon reviewing the table, only one game (Row 7) lists this specific attendance number.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"less than 17132 crowd be in attendance for only 4 of the game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It says that there were less than 17,132 attendees at four games. So I need to check each row in the table and count how many times the attendance was below 17,132.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has an \"attendance\" column which shows the number of people who attended that game. The rows are from December 2 to December 30.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1 (Dec 2)**: Attendance is 21,273. That's more than 17,132.\n2. **Row 2 (Dec 4)**: Attendance is also 21,273. Again, above 17k.\n3. **Row 3 (Dec 6)**: Still 21,273. No change here.\n4. **Row 4 (Dec 9)**: Attendance drops to 21,273 again. Wait, no, that's the same as before.\n5. **Row 5 (Dec 11)**: Same attendance number.\n6. **Row 6 (Dec 13)**: Still 21,273. So up to here, all attendances are above 17k except maybe some later rows.\n\nWait a second, let me check Row 7 onwards because I might have skipped something.\n\n**Row 7 (Dec 16)**: Attendance is 16,434. That's less than 17,132. So that's one game.\n**Row 8 (Dec 18)**: Back to 21,273. Above again.\n**Row 9 (Dec 20)**: Same as above.\n**Row 10 (Dec 21)**: Still 21k. No change here.\n\nNow looking at the last few games where Montreal is away:\n\n- **Row 11 (Dec 27)**: Visitor, attendance 17,132. Wait, but the claim says \"less than\" so 17,132 is equal, not less. So this doesn't count.\n- **Row 12 (Dec 29)**: Attendance 20,741. That's above.\n- **Row 13 (Dec 30)**: 20,454. Also above.\n\nSo from the entire table, only Row 7 has an attendance below 17,132. The claim says \"only 4 of the game\" had less than that. But according to my count, it's just one game where attendance was lower than 17,132.\n\nWait, did I miss any rows? Let me double-check:\n\nRows 1-6: All have attendance 21,273 except Row 7 at 16,434. Then Rows 8-10 are again 21k or so. Rows 11-13 are also above or equal to 17k. So only one game (Row 7) meets the condition.\n\nSince the claim states that this happened for four games but it's actually only one, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because only one game had attendance less than 17,132, not four.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"over 40 point be score for at least 5 game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It seems a bit grammatically off, but I think it means that in at least five games, the team scored over 40 points. Alternatively, maybe it's about total points across multiple games? Hmm, actually, looking again, \"over 40 point be score for at least 5 game\" could mean that there are at least five games where the team's score was over 40 points.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game. The relevant columns here would be the 'points' column because it shows the total points for each game. Each row has a 'points' value which is the sum of wins and ties converted into points (2 points for a win, 1 for an overtime loss or tie). \n\nLet's go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Points = 32 \u2192 Not over 40.\nRow 2: Points = 34 \u2192 Still under 40.\nRow 3: Points = 35 \u2192 Under.\nRow 4: Points = 37 \u2192 No.\nRow 5: Points remain at 37 \u2192 Still under.\nRow 6: Points still at 37 \u2192 No.\nRow 7: Points up to 37 \u2192 Wait, actually no change? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nRow 1: Points = 32\nRow 2: 34\nRow 3: 35\nRow 4: 37\nRow 5: Still 37 (lost one point?)\nWait, the points column doesn't represent individual game points but cumulative points. Oh, that's a misunderstanding on my part.\n\nAh! The 'points' column is the team's total points up to that game, not per game. So each row adds to their total points. Therefore, to find if they had at least five games where their score (the team's goals) was over 40 in those games.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the 'score' column shows the game result as visitor_score - home_score. The 'points' column is their cumulative points from all previous games plus this one.\n\nSo for each game, to check if their total points (i.e., cumulative) are over 40 in at least five games.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Points =32\n- Row 2: 34\n- Row3:35\n- Row4:37\n- Row5:37\n- Row6:37\n- Row7:37 (still)\n- Row8:39\n- Row9:41 \u2192 Now, points over 40.\nRow10:42\nRow11:44\nRow12:46\nRow13:48\n\nSo how many rows have points >40? Let's count:\n\nRows from row9 onwards (row indices starting at 0):\n\nRow9: index 8, points 41 \u2192 over 40.\nRow10: index9, 42\nRow11: index10,44\nRow12: index11,46\nRow13: index12,48\n\nThat's five rows (indices 8-12) where points are over 40. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nWait, but does each row represent a game? Yes, each row is a separate game. Therefore, from row9 to row13, there are five games where their total points were above 40. Hence, the claim holds.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\":8, \"column_name\":\"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\":9, \"column_name\":\"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\":10, \"column_name\":\"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\":11, \"column_name\":\"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\":12, \"column_name\":\"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
