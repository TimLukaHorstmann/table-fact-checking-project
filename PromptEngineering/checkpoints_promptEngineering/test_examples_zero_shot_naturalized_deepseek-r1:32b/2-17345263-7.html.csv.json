The claim says: \"alabama be the opponent when they play at legion field birmingham, al\". Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim refers to. The main points are:\n\n1. The opponent's name is Alabama.\n2. The location where they play is Legion Field in Birmingham, AL.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple rows with different opponents and sites. My goal is to find a row where both conditions are met: opponent is Alabama and site is Legion Field in Birmingham, AL.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- Row 1: Opponent is Virginia Tech, site is Lane Stadium Blacksburg, VA. Not relevant.\n- Row 2: Opponent is Chattanooga, site is Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium Greenville, NC. Not relevant.\n- Row 3: Opponent is Ohio, site is Peden Stadium Athens, OH. Not relevant.\n- Row 4: Opponent is Army, same site as Row 2. No Alabama here.\n- Row 5: Opponent is UAB, still in the same stadium. Not Alabama.\n- Row 6: Here's a row with opponent Alabama. Let me check the site. The site says Legion Field Birmingham, AL. That matches exactly what the claim states. So this row supports both parts of the claim.\n- Rows 7 to 12 don't mention Alabama again or have different sites.\n\nSo, Row 6 has the opponent as Alabama and the correct location. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because there's a match in the table where Alabama is the opponent at that specific site.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in row 6 where the opponent is Alabama and the site is Legion Field Birmingham, AL.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"site\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"on november 14 louisville play at dowdy - ficklen stadium greenville , nc\". So, this statement has two main parts:\n\n1. The date of the game is November 14.\n2. The location where Louisville played was Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium in Greenville, NC.\n\nI need to check if both these pieces of information are correct according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 12 rows. Each row represents a different game with details like date, opponent, site, result, and attendance.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n- Row 1: September 5 vs Virginia Tech at Lane Stadium.\n- Row 2: September 12 vs Chattanooga at Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium.\n- Row 3: September 19 vs Ohio at Peden Stadium.\n- Row 4: October 3 vs Army at Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium.\n- Row 5: October 10 vs UAB at Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium.\n- Row 6: October 17 vs Alabama at Legion Field.\n- Row 7: October 24 vs Southern Miss at MM Roberts Stadium.\n- Row 8: October 31 vs Houston at Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium.\n- Row 9: November 5 vs Cincinnati at Nippert Stadium.\n- Row 10: November 14 vs Louisville at Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium.\n- Row 11: November 21 vs Memphis at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium.\n- Row 12: Seems to be a header or something since all cells say \"all times are in eastern.\"\n\nSo, focusing on the relevant rows:\n\nLooking for the date \"November 14\". I see that Row 10 has the date as November 14. The opponent is Louisville, and the site is Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium in Greenville, NC.\n\nThis matches exactly with the claim made. So both parts of the claim are correct: the game was on November 14, against Louisville at Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. The table lists Row 10 as November 14, opponent Louisville, site Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium, result L45-63, attendance 26258.\n\nSo the claim is accurate according to this data. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that on November 14, Louisville played at Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium in Greenville, NC.

The opponent in that row is Alabama.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table to find where the opponent is Alabama and check the corresponding attendance figure.\n\nLooking at Row 6:\n- Date: October 17\n- Opponent: alabama\n- Site: legion field birmingham, al\n- Result: l22 - 23\n- Attendance: 80079\n\nThis matches both conditions.

I need to determine if the claim \"there be 31002 crowd attendance when uab be the opponent\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table data. Each row has several columns: date, opponent, site, result, and attendance. My task is to find any row where the opponent is UAB and check if the attendance for that game was 31002.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 5 has the opponent as UAB. Let me check the other details here. The date is October 10th, site is Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium in Greenville, NC. The result is a win with scores 26-7. The attendance listed is 31002.\n\nComparing this to the claim: when UAB was the opponent (Row 5), the attendance was indeed 31002. So both parts of the claim match exactly what's in the table.\n\nI don't see any other rows where UAB is the opponent, so Row 5 is the only relevant one here.

The date is September 12, and on that day, they played against Chattanooga with an attendance of 34,028.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a game with details like date, opponent, site, result, and attendance. I should go through each row to find the one where the date is September 12.\n\nScanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: September 5\n- Row 2: September 12 \u2192 This is the row we need.\n  \nNow, in this row (Row 2), let's check the opponent. The opponent listed is Chattanooga, which matches the claim. Next, I'll verify the attendance figure. In the same row under the 'attendance' column, it says 34028, which exactly matches the number stated in the claim.\n\nSo both conditions are satisfied: the date is correct, the opponent is correct, and the attendance figure aligns with what's provided. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing anything else. Are there any other rows with September 12? No, only Row 2 has that date.

The claim says: \"alabama be the opponent when the attendance be 81079.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It's saying that when the attendance was 81,079, the opponent was Alabama. So, essentially, we're looking for a row in the table where the opponent is Alabama and the attendance is exactly 81,079.\n\nLooking at the table rows one by one:\n\nRow 1: Opponent is Virginia Tech, Attendance is 48,134. Doesn't match.\nRow 2: Opponent is Chattanooga, Attendance is 34,028. No match.\nRow 3: Opponent is Ohio, Attendance is 19,186. Nope.\nRow 4: Army, 40,607. Not relevant.\nRow 5: UAB, 31,002. Still no.\nRow 6: Alabama as the opponent, attendance is 80,079. Hmm, that's close but not exactly 81,079. There's a difference of 1,000 people here.\nRow 7: Southern Miss, 24,020. No match.\nRow 8: Houston, 26,821. Not relevant.\nRow 9: Cincinnati, 19,098. Nope.\nRow 10: Louisville, 26,258. Doesn't fit.\nRow 11: Memphis, 16,052. No match.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check Row 6. It says attendance is 80,079 for Alabama as the opponent. The claim mentions 81,079. That's off by exactly 1,000. So that's not an exact match.\n\nIs there any other row where the attendance was 81,079? Scanning through again, I don't see such a figure in any of the rows except Row 6 which is 80,079. \n\nSo the claim states that when the opponent was Alabama, the attendance was 81,079, but according to the table, the attendance was 80,079 on that date. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the data provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because while Alabama is indeed an opponent in one of the rows, the attendance figure doesn't match what's claimed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Alabama was the opponent when attendance was 81,079.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"uab be the opponent when the attendance be 33002\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim states that UAB was the opponent in a game where the attendance was 33,002. So, I need to check two things: whether there is an entry in the table where the opponent is UAB and if in that same row, the attendance was exactly 33,002.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with details like date, opponent, site, result, and attendance. The rows are indexed from 1 to 12, but I think when considering JSON objects, it's better to use zero-based indexing, so rows go from 0 to 11.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1 (index 0): Opponent is Virginia Tech, attendance 48,134. Not UAB and not 33k.\n\nRow 2 (index 1): Opponent is Chattanooga, attendance 34,028. Close to 33k but still higher than the claim.\n\nRow 3 (index 2): Opponent Ohio, attendance 19,186. Lower than needed.\n\nRow 4 (index 3): Army as opponent, attendance 40,607. Higher.\n\nRow 5 (index 4): UAB is the opponent here. Let's check the attendance: 31,002. Hmm, that's 31k, not 33k. So, close but not matching.\n\nWait, the claim says 33002, which is 33,002. But in row 5 (index 4), it's 31,002. That's a difference of 2,000 attendees. Maybe I'm missing something? Let me double-check all rows to ensure I didn't skip any.\n\nRow 6: Alabama opponent, attendance 80,079. Nope.\n\nRow 7: Southern Miss, 24,020. No.\n\nRow 8: Houston, 26,821. No.\n\nRow 9: Cincinnati, 19,098. No.\n\nRow 10: Louisville, 26,258. No.\n\nRow 11: Memphis, 16,052. No.\n\nRow 12 (index 11): This row seems to be a note about all times being in Eastern, so it's not relevant for our data points.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I made a mistake with the indices? Let me recount:\n\nRow 1: Index 0\n\nRow 2: Index 1\n\n...\n\nRow 5: That should be index 4. So opponent UAB at row index 4, attendance 31,002.\n\nSo in this case, there's no instance where the opponent is UAB and the attendance is exactly 33,002. The closest is 31,002 which is less than 33k. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data in the table.\n\nHence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that UAB was the opponent when attendance was 33,002.
