    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"hayate usui be only 1 time defeat in round 3\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Hayate Usui has only one loss (defeat) in the third round of his matches. So, my task is to check how many times he lost when the round was 3.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match with details like result, record, opponent, method, event, round, and time. The rows are indexed from 1 to 19, but in programming terms, they might be zero-indexed if we're considering arrays or lists. However, in this context, since the user provided rows as Row 1 to Row 19, I'll consider row indexes starting at 1.\n\nI need to go through each row and check two things:\n1. The result of the match (whether it's a loss).\n2. The round number where the match took place.\n\nThe claim is about having only one defeat in round 3, so I'm specifically looking for rows where 'res' is 'loss' and 'round' is 3.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- **Row 1**: res: loss, round: 2 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- **Row 2**: res: loss, round: 3 \u2192 This fits. So this is one loss in round 3.\n- **Row 3**: res: win, round: 2 \u2192 Irrelevant.\n- **Row 4**: res: win, round: 2 \u2192 Irrelevant.\n- **Row 5**: res: win, round: 2 \u2192 Irrelevant.\n- **Row 6**: res: loss, round: 2 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- **Row 7**: res: win, round: 2 \u2192 Irrelevant.\n- **Row 8**: res: win, round: 2 \u2192 Irrelevant.\n- **Row 9**: res: draw, round: 2 \u2192 Irrelevant (not a loss).\n- **Row 10**: res: win, round: 2 \u2192 Irrelevant.\n- **Row 11**: res: win, round: 2 \u2192 Irrelevant.\n- **Row 12**: res: loss, round: 2 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- **Row 13**: res: win, round: 2 \u2192 Irrelevant.\n- **Row 14**: res: loss, round: 2 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- **Row 15**: res: win, round: 2 \u2192 Irrelevant.\n- **Row 16**: res: win, round: 2 \u2192 Irrelevant.\n- **Row 17**: res: loss, round: 2 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- **Row 18**: res: loss, round: 2 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- **Row 19**: res: loss, round: 2 \u2192 Not relevant.\n\nFrom this review, only Row 2 has a 'res' of 'loss' and 'round' as 3. So there's only one instance where Hayate Usui lost in the third round. \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because he has exactly one defeat in round 3.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"4 of usui's fight end before the 5-minute period be up.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should look at each row in the table and check if any fights ended before the 5-minute mark. Each row has a 'time' column which shows how long the fight lasted. The claim is about four fights ending before the 5-minute period, so I'm looking for rows where the time is less than 5:00.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Time is 5:00. That's exactly at the limit, not before.\nRow 2: Also 5:00. Same as above.\nRow 3: 5:00 again. No change here.\nRow 4: Still 5:00. Not less than that.\nRow 5: Time is 5:00. Same result.\nRow 6: Again, 5:00. So far, none of these are before 5 minutes.\nRow 7: 5:00. Same pattern continues.\nRow 8: 5:00 as well. No luck yet.\n\nMoving on to Row 9: Time is 5:00. Still not under.\nRow 10: 5:00 again. Hmm, still nothing before the mark.\nRow 11: Also 5:00. Not helpful for this claim.\n\nNow, looking at Row 12: The time here is 4:51. That's less than 5 minutes! So that's one fight that ended early.\nRow 13: Time is 2:38. Definitely before the 5-minute mark. That's two fights now.\nRow 14: 4:58. Another one under five minutes, making it three.\nRow 15: Time is 5:00. No change here.\nRow 16: Also 5:00. Still no fourth fight before the time limit.\n\nRow 17: Time is 5:00. Not relevant.\nRow 18: Again, 5:00. Same as above.\nRow 19: 2:06. That's way under five minutes. So that's four fights now.\n\nWait a minute, so I found four rows where the time was less than 5:00. Those are Rows 12, 13, 14, and 19. Each of these entries shows that the fight ended before the five-minute period. \n\nBut wait, looking back at the claim again: \"4 of usui's fights end before the 5-minute period.\" The claim uses \"usui,\" but in all the rows, I don't see any fighter named Usui as an opponent. All opponents have different last names like Tamura, Nakamura, etc. So is this even about Usui? Or maybe I misread.\n\nWait no, actually, looking again at each row, perhaps 'usui' refers to the fighter whose record we're tracking. Because the table shows 'res', which could be the result of USUI's fights. Let me check: in Row 1, opponent is Issei Tamura, and the result was a loss. So this might be USUI's fight against Tamura. If that's the case, then all these rows are about Usui's fights.\n\nSo if that's correct, then Rows 12, 13, 14, and 19 show fights that ended before five minutes. That makes four fights, which matches the claim exactly. So the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"3 of usui's win be by majority decision\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll understand what each part of the claim means. The subject here is \"usui,\" which I assume refers to a fighter named Usui. The claim states that three of his wins were decided by majority decision. So, I need to look through the table and count how many times Usui won with a method described as a \"majority decision.\"\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a fight result. Each row has columns like 'res' (result), 'record', 'opponent', 'method', etc. The relevant columns for this claim are 'res' to check if it's a win and 'method' to see if it was a majority decision.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Result is loss. Doesn't count.\n2. **Row 2**: Result is loss. Doesn't count.\n3. **Row 3**: Result is win. Method is \"decision (unanimous).\" Not a majority decision, so doesn't count towards the claim.\n4. **Row 4**: Result is win. Method is \"decision (majority).\" This counts as one.\n5. **Row 5**: Result is win. Method is \"decision (unanimous).\" Doesn't count.\n6. **Row 6**: Result is loss. Doesn't count.\n7. **Row 7**: Result is win. Method is \"decision (unanimous).\" Doesn't count.\n8. **Row 8**: Result is win. Method is \"decision (unanimous).\" Doesn't count.\n9. **Row 9**: Result is draw. Not a win, so doesn't count.\n10. **Row 10**: Result is win. Method is \"decision (majority).\" This counts as two.\n11. **Row 11**: Result is win. Method is \"decision (unanimous).\" Doesn't count.\n12. **Row 12**: Result is loss. Doesn't count.\n13. **Row 13**: Result is win. Method is submission, not a decision type. So doesn't count.\n14. **Row 14**: Result is loss. Doesn't count.\n15. **Row 15**: Result is win. Method is \"decision (majority).\" This counts as three.\n16. **Row 16**: Result is win. Method is \"decision (majority).\" Wait, that would make it four if I include this. But let me double-check the claim: it says \"3 of usui's win be by majority decision.\" So up to here, we have rows 4, 10, and 15 as wins with majority decisions\u2014three in total.\n\nWait a second, row 16 also has a win with method \"decision (majority).\" That would actually make it four, not three. But the claim says three. So perhaps I miscounted earlier or maybe the rows beyond this don't belong to usui?\n\nHold on, looking back at all rows:\n\n- Row 4: method is majority \u2192 count 1\n- Row 10: method is majority \u2192 count 2\n- Row 15: method is majority \u2192 count 3\n- Row 16: method is majority \u2192 count 4\n\nSo according to this, there are four wins by majority decision. But the claim states three. That would mean the claim is false.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me go through each row again carefully:\n\n1. Rows with 'res' as win:\n   - Row3: method unanimous \u2192 no\n   - Row4: method majority \u2192 yes (1)\n   - Row5: method unanimous \u2192 no\n   - Row7: method unanimous \u2192 no\n   - Row8: method unanimous \u2192 no\n   - Row10: method majority \u2192 yes (2)\n   - Row11: method unanimous \u2192 no\n   - Row13: submission \u2192 not a decision, so no\n   - Row15: method majority \u2192 yes (3)\n   - Row16: method majority \u2192 yes (4)\n\nSo that's four instances where the result is win and the method is majority decision.\n\nBut wait, maybe some rows don't belong to usui. The table only lists opponents, not necessarily usui as the fighter. So perhaps in this table, all these fights are from usui's perspective. But I'm assuming each row represents a fight that usui participated in, with 'opponent' being who he fought against.\n\nIf that's the case, then four wins by majority decision would make the claim of three incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE because there are more than three such wins.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misinterpreting 'usui.' Maybe usui is not the fighter in all these rows. The table doesn't specify who the fighter is\u2014only the opponent. So if the claim is about a specific fighter named Usui, then maybe only some of these rows are his fights.\n\nBut without knowing which rows belong to Usui as the fighter, I can't accurately count. However, given that the table seems to list all of usui's fights (since it starts from record 0-1 and builds up), perhaps each row is indeed a fight involving usui.\n\nIn that case, four wins by majority decision would mean the claim is FALSE because three is less than four. Alternatively, maybe I'm counting incorrectly. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at all rows where 'res' is win:\n\n- Row3: method (unanimous) \u2192 no\n- Row4: method (majority) \u2192 yes (1)\n- Row5: method (unanimous) \u2192 no\n- Row7: method (unanimous) \u2192 no\n- Row8: method (unanimous) \u2192 no\n- Row10: method (majority) \u2192 yes (2)\n- Row11: method (unanimous) \u2192 no\n- Row13: submission \u2192 not a decision, so no\n- Row15: method (majority) \u2192 yes (3)\n- Row16: method (majority) \u2192 yes (4)\n\nSo four wins by majority decision. Therefore, the claim that three of his wins were by majority is false because it's actually four.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in considering rows beyond row 16? The table only goes up to row 19 (as per the last row index given), so let me check all rows again:\n\nRows where 'res' is win and method is majority decision:\n\n- Row4: yes\n- Row10: yes\n- Row15: yes\n- Row16: yes\n\nThat's four. Therefore, the claim of three is incorrect. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding \"3 of usui's win.\" It could mean that out of all his wins, 3 are majority decisions. If he has more than three wins with majority decisions, then the claim is still TRUE as long as at least three are by majority. But no, the exact wording is \"3 of usui's win be by majority decision,\" which implies exactly three.\n\nIn that case, since there are four, it would make the claim false because it's not exactly three but more. Alternatively, if the claim allows for at least three, then TRUE. However, given the phrasing, I think it's meant to say exactly three. So with four instances, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check again:\n\nRow4: yes (1)\nRow10: yes (2)\nRow15: yes (3)\nRow16: yes (4)\n\nSo that's four. Therefore, the answer is FALSE because there are more than three wins by majority decision.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that exactly three of Usui's wins were by majority decision. Upon reviewing each row in the table, we found four instances where the result was a win and the method was a majority decision. Since the count exceeds three, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the defeat by a ko do not occur in the same tournament as the drawn match\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It states that there isn't a KO loss and a draw in the same event. So, I need to check if any row where the result was a KO loss (res: loss and method: ko) shares the same event as the drawn match.\n\nLooking at the table, the only drawn match is in Row 9, which has res: draw and event: pip - east vs west.\n\nNow, checking for KO losses. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 14: res: loss, method: ko (punch), event: shooto.\n- Any other rows with method: ko? Let's see:\n   - Row 9 is a draw, not a loss.\n   - Row 17: res: loss, method: decision (majority).\n   - Others either have submission or decision methods.\n\nSo the only KO loss is in Row 14. The event for that row is shooto. \n\nThe drawn match's event is pip - east vs west. Since shooto \u2260 pip - east vs west, there's no overlap. Therefore, the KO loss and draw don't occur in the same tournament.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows of the table are relevant to this claim. The claim mentions two fights: one against Daisuke Ishizawa and another against Manabu Inoue. \n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For Daisuke Ishizawa: I scan each row until I find where the opponent is Daisuke Ishizawa. That's Row 5.\n- For Manabu Inoue: I look for rows where the opponent is Manabu Inoue, which is Row 10.\n\nNow, I need to check how Usui defeated these opponents and compare the methods of victory to assess which was more convincing. The methods are listed under the 'method' column.\n\n- Against Daisuke Ishizawa (Row 5), the method is \"decision (unanimous)\".\n- Against Manabu Inoue (Row 10), the method is \"decision (majority)\".\n\nIn terms of how convincing a decision is, a unanimous decision means all judges agreed on the outcome, which is more convincing than a majority decision where two out of three judges agreed. Therefore, defeating Daisuke Ishizawa with a unanimous decision would be considered more convincing than defeating Manabu Inoue with a majority decision.\n\nSo the claim that Usui defeated Daisuke Ishizawa more convincingly than Manabu Inoue is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Usui's victory over Daisuke Ishizawa was via a unanimous decision, which is more convincing than the majority decision against Manabu Inoue.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim means. It's saying that Hayate Usui has never been defeated in any of his fights. So, I need to check if there are any losses in his record according to the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match with details like result (res), record, opponent, method, event, round, and time. The 'res' column shows whether it was a win or loss.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Row 1: res is 'loss'. So this means Hayate lost this fight.\n2. Row 2: Another 'loss'.\n3. Row 3: 'win', so that's a victory.\n4. Row 4: 'win' again.\n5. Row 5: 'win' as well.\n6. Row 6: 'loss'.\n7. Row 7: 'win'.\n8. Row 8: 'win'.\n9. Row 9: 'draw', so that's neither a win nor a loss.\n10.

Therefore, the claim that he was never defeated is not true.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells that support this conclusion. The key information is in the 'res' column for each row where it shows a loss. Each of these losses indicates a defeat, which directly contradicts the claim.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are all rows where 'res' is 'loss'.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"none of usui's fight end before the 5-minute period be up\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim is saying. It states that none of Usui's fights ended before the five-minute mark in each round. In other words, every fight went the full duration without ending early due to a knockout, submission, or any other stoppage before the 5 minutes were up.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each row to see if the time column shows exactly 5:00 or less than that. If any row has a time less than 5:00, then the claim would be FALSE because that fight ended early.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\nRow 1: Time is 5:00 - full duration.\nRow 2: Time is 5:00 - same here.\nRow 3: Also 5:00.\nRow 4: 5:00 again.\nRow 5: 5:00.\nRow 6: 5:00.\nRow 7: 5:00.\nRow 8: 5:00.\nRow 9: Time is 5:00, but it's a draw. Draws can happen at the end of the time period.\nRow 10: 5:00.\nRow 11: 5:00.\nRow 12: Time is 4:51 - that's less than 5 minutes. So this fight ended early because of a submission (rear naked choke). This means Usui lost this fight before the 5-minute mark.\nRow 13: Time is 2:38 - definitely less than 5 minutes. Submission via armlock, so another early finish.\nRow 14: 4:58 - just shy of 5 minutes, ended by knockout.\nRow 15: 5:00.\nRow 16: 5:00.\nRow 17: 5:00.\nRow 18: 5:00.\nRow 19: Time is 2:06 - very early end due to TKO.\n\nSo, there are multiple instances where Usui's fights ended before the 5-minute period. Specifically, rows 12, 13, 14, and 19 have times less than 5:00. This means the claim that none of his fights ended early is FALSE.\n\nI should note which cells are relevant to this conclusion. These would be all the time columns where the time is less than 5 minutes because they directly contradict the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that none of Usui's fights ended before five minutes, but several fights did end early as shown in rows 12, 13, 14, and 19.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the defeat by a ko occur in the same tournament as the drawn match\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It says that there was a loss (defeat) via knockout (KO) and a draw, both of which happened in the same event or tournament. So I need to find if there's any row where the result is 'loss' with method 'ko', and see what event that was. Then check if there's another row where the result is 'draw' in the same event.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like result (res), record, opponent, method, event, round, time.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: res loss, method decision (unanimous), event shooto. Not KO or draw.\nRow 2: res loss, method decision (unanimous), event shooto. Same as above.\nRow 3: res win, method decision (unanimous), event tenkaichi fight. Doesn't matter since it's a win.\nRow 4: res win, method decision (majority), event shooto.\nRow 5: res win, method decision (unanimous), event shooto.\nRow 6: res loss, method decision (unanimous), event shooto. Not KO.\nRow 7: res win, method decision (unanimous), event shooto.\nRow 8: res win, method decision (unanimous), event shooto.\nRow 9: res draw, method draw, event pip - east vs west. So this is the drawn match in event 'pip - east vs west'.\nRow 10: res win, method decision (majority), event gcm - dog 5.\nRow 11: res win, method decision (unanimous), event mars.\nRow 12: res loss, method submission (rear naked choke), event shooto. Not KO.\nRow 13: res win, method submission (armlock), event shooto.\nRow 14: res loss, method ko (punch), event shooto. This is the KO loss in event 'shooto'.\nRow 15: res win, method decision (majority), event shooto.\nRow 16: res win, method decision (majority), event shooto.\nRow 17: res loss, method decision (majority), event shooto. Not KO.\nRow 18: res loss, method decision (unanimous), event shooto. Not KO.\nRow 19: res loss, method tko, event shooto.\n\nWait, row 14 is a loss with method 'ko' in event 'shooto'. The draw was in event 'pip - east vs west'.\n\nSo the KO loss happened in 'shooto', while the drawn match was in 'pip - east vs west'. These are different events. Therefore, they didn't occur in the same tournament.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if there's another row with a KO and the draw is in the same event.\n\nLooking back, only row 14 has method KO (punch) and it's in 'shooto'. The draw is in 'pip - east vs west' which is a different event. So they didn't happen in the same tournament.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both the defeat by KO and the drawn match occurred in the same tournament. Upon reviewing the table, the KO loss (row 14) was in 'shooto', while the draw (row 9) was in 'pip - east vs west'. These are different events, so the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"usui defeat daisuke ishizawa in the same manner he defeat manabu inoue\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It says that Usui defeated Daisuke Ishizawa and Manabu Inoue using the same method. So I need to check how each of these opponents was defeated by Usui.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find the matches against Daisuke Ishizawa and Manabu Inoue.\n\nStarting with Daisuke Ishizawa: Scanning through the rows, Row 5 has opponent \"daisuke ishizawa\". The method here is listed as \"decision (unanimous)\".\n\nNext, for Manabu Inoue: I check each row and find that Row 10 mentions opponent \"manabu inoue\" with a result of \"win\". The method used was \"decision (majority)\".\n\nNow, comparing the two methods: Daisuke Ishizawa was defeated by a unanimous decision, while Manabu Inoue's defeat came via a majority decision. Since these are different types of decisions, Usui did not use the same manner to defeat both opponents.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
