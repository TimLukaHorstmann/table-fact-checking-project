The county must have joined after 1926.\n2. The county must have participated in the Olympic conference.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- Each row represents a school with details including \"year joined\" and \"previous conference.\"\n\nI'll go through each row to check these conditions.\n\nRow 1: Anderson\n- Year Joined: 1926 \u2192 Not after 1926. So, doesn't meet the first condition.\n- Previous Conference: Independents \u2192 Doesn't match Olympic.\nSo, this row is not relevant.\n\nRow 2: Huntington North\n- Year Joined: 2003 \u2192 After 1926. Meets the first condition.\n- Previous Conference: Olympic \u2192 Matches the second condition.\nThis row satisfies both conditions. The county here is 35 huntington.\n\nRows 3 to 8:\n-kokomo, logansport community, marion, muncie central, new castle chrysler, richmond\n\nEach of these rows has \"year joined\" as either 1926 or later but not after 2003. However, their previous conferences are mostly \"independents,\" except Huntington North which was in the Olympic conference.\n\nSo, only Row 2 meets both conditions. The county is indeed 35 huntington.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because only Huntington North (Row 2) joined after 1926 and was part of the Olympic conference.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"previous conference\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"olympic have an ihsaa class / football / soccer of 4a / 5a / 2a and join after 1926\". \n\nFirst, I should parse the claim into two main parts. Part one is about Olympic's IHSAA classification for each sport, and part two is about when they joined, specifically if it was after 1926.\n\nLooking at the table, there are eight rows, each representing a different school. The columns include 'school', 'location', 'mascot', 'county', 'enrollment', 'ihsaa class / football / soccer', 'year joined', and 'previous conference'.\n\nThe claim mentions \"olympic\", so I need to check if any of the schools in the table are named Olympic. Scanning through the 'school' column:\n\nRow 1: Anderson\nRow 2: Huntington North\nRow 3: Kokomo\nRow 4: Logansport Community\nRow 5: Marion\nRow 6: Muncie Central\nRow 7: New Castle Chrysler\nRow 8: Richmond\n\nNone of these are named Olympic. However, looking at the 'previous conference' column might be relevant because the claim refers to \"olympic\" in that context. Let me check each row's previous conference:\n\nRow 1: independents\nRow 2: olympic\nRow 3: independents\nRow 4: independents\nRow 5: independents\nRow 6: independents\nRow 7: independents\nRow 8: independents\n\nAh, Row 2 has the previous conference as \"olympic\". So, Olympic is actually the name of a conference that Huntington North was part of before joining their current conference.\n\nNow, checking the claim's first part: does the Olympic conference (as represented by Huntington North) have an IHSAA classification of 4a / 5a / 2a? Looking at Row 2's 'ihsaa class / football / soccer' column, it says 4a / 5a / 2a. So that matches.\n\nNext, the claim states they joined after 1926. The 'year joined' for Huntington North is 2003, which is indeed after 1926. Therefore, both parts of the claim are satisfied based on Row 2.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to the conference \"olympic\" (Huntington North's previous conference) having a specific IHSAA classification and joining after 1926. Both conditions are met as per the data in Row 2.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ihsaa class / football / soccer\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"huntington north , viking as the mascot , join in 2003\".\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components to check each part against the table.\n\n1. **School Name**: The first part of the claim mentions \"huntington north\". I need to find this school in the table. Looking through the rows, Row 2 is for Huntington North. So that's a match.\n\n2. **Mascot**: The claim states the mascot is \"viking\". Checking Row 2, under the 'mascot' column, it indeed says \"vikings\". Although the claim uses \"viking\" singular and the table has plural, I think this is just a minor grammatical difference and refers to the same mascot. So that's correct.\n\n3. **Year Joined**: The claim says they joined in 2003. Looking at Row 2 under 'year joined', it shows 2003. That matches perfectly.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies between the claim and the table. Each piece of information from the claim is accurately represented in Row 2 of the table.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that if the school in question is Logansport Community, then its mascot should be \"berries\". My task is to check this against the given data.\n\nLooking at the table, there are eight rows, each representing a different school. Each row has several columns: school name, location, mascot, county, enrollment, IHSAA class details (football and soccer), year joined, and previous conference.\n\nI need to find the row where the school is Logansport Community. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Anderson\n- Row 2: Huntington North\n- Row 3: Kokomo\n- Row 4: Logansport Community \u2013 this is the one.\n- Rows 5-8: Other schools.\n\nSo, focusing on Row 4. The columns here are school (Logansport Community), location (Logansport), mascot (berries), county (09 Cass), enrollment (1245), IHSAA classes (4a / 4a / 2a), year joined (1926), and previous conference (independents).\n\nThe claim is about the mascot when the school is Logansport Community. From Row 4, under the 'mascot' column, it clearly states \"berries\". That matches exactly with what the claim says.\n\nSo, checking each part:\n\n- School name: Logansport Community \u2013 correct.\n- Mascot: berries \u2013 correct.\n\nThere's no discrepancy here. The relevant cells would be the school name and mascot in that row to confirm both parts of the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the data supports it completely.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break down each part of the claim and check it against the data in the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"Anderson school have an 1884 enrollment in 48 Madison county and have a Viking mascot.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for the Anderson school in the table. Scanning through the rows, Row 1 has \"school: anderson\". That's our target row.\n\nNow, checking each part of the claim:\n\n1. **Enrollment**: The claim mentions an enrollment of 1884. Looking at Row 1 under the \"enrollment\" column, it indeed shows 1884. So this part is correct.\n\n2. **County**: The claim states Anderson is in 48 Madison county. From the table, Row 1's \"county\" is listed as \"48 madison\". This matches exactly with what the claim says about the county. So that's accurate too.\n\n3. **Mascot**: The claim claims Anderson has a Viking mascot. Checking the \"mascot\" column in Row 1, it shows \"indians\", not Vikings. Hmm, this is different. \n\nWait a minute, let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up any rows. Looking at other schools, Huntington North (Row 2) does have the Viking mascot. But Anderson's mascot is clearly listed as Indians. So the claim about the mascot being Vikings doesn't hold true for Anderson.\n\nSo, out of the three parts in the claim:\n- Enrollment and county are correct.\n- Mascot is incorrect because it's Indians, not Vikings.\n\nSince one part of the claim is false, the entire statement isn't fully supported by the table. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nI also need to note which cells were relevant for checking each part of the claim:\n- Enrollment: Row 1, \"enrollment\"\n- County: Row 1, \"county\"\n- Mascot: Row 1, \"mascot\"\n\nSo the relevant cells are these three in Row 1.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"county\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The football classification here is 5a, not 4a as required. So this row doesn't satisfy the IHSAA condition.\n\nRow 2: Huntington North\n- Previous Conference: olympic (doesn't match)\nSo this row can be skipped.\n\nRow 3: Kokomo\n- Previous Conference: independents (matches)\n- IHSAA Class/Football/Soccer: 4a / 5a / 2a. Football is 5a again, not matching the required 4a. So this doesn't work either.\n\nRow 4: Logansport Community\n- Previous Conference: independents (matches)\n- IHSAA Class/Football/Soccer: 4a / 4a / 2a. Here, football is 4a, which fits.\n- Year Joined: 1926. The claim requires a year larger than 1926, so this doesn't meet the criteria.\n\nRow 5: Marion\n- Previous Conference: independents (matches)\n- IHSAA Class/Football/Soccer: 4a / 4a / 2a. Football is 4a.\n- Year Joined: 1933. This is larger than 1926, so this row satisfies all conditions.\n\nRow 6: Muncie Central\n- Previous Conference: independents (matches)\n- IHSAA Class/Football/Soccer: 3a / 4a / 2a. Football is 4a.\n- Year Joined: 1926. The year needs to be larger than 1926, so this doesn't fit.\n\nRow 7: New Castle Chrysler\n- Previous Conference: independents (matches)\n- IHSAA Class/Football/Soccer: 4a / 4a / 2a. Football is 4a.\n- Year Joined: 1926. Again, the year isn't larger than 1926.\n\nRow 8: Richmond\n- Previous Conference: independents (matches)\n- IHSAA Class/Football/Soccer: 4a / 5a / 2a. Football is 5a, so it doesn't meet the condition.\n\nSo, after reviewing all rows, only Row 5 (Marion) meets all three conditions:\n- Previous conference is independents.\n- IHSAA football classification is 4a.\n- Year joined is 1933, which is larger than 1926.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"the / county that have a year join less than 1926, and a previous conference of independent be 35 huntington.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse this claim correctly. It seems to be saying that the counties with both a year joined less than 1926 and a previous conference of independents should be \"35 huntington.\" So I'm looking for schools where the year joined is before 1926 (i.e., less than 1926) and their previous conference was independents. Then, among those, their county should be 35 huntington.\n\nWait, but let me check each part carefully. The claim might actually mean that the counties with a year join less than 1926 and a previous conference of independent are \"35 huntington.\" So perhaps it's saying that all such counties (those who joined before 1926 and were previously in independents) should be 35 huntington. Alternatively, maybe it's asserting that the county is 35 huntington if both conditions are met.\n\nLet me check each row to see which ones meet these criteria: year joined <1926 and previous conference = independents.\n\nLooking at each school:\n\nRow 1: Anderson\nYear Joined: 1926. This is not less than 1926, so it doesn't qualify.\nPrevious Conference: independents. But since the year isn't less than 1926, this row doesn't fit both conditions.\n\nRow 2: Huntington North\nYear Joined: 2003. That's way more than 1926, so no.\nPrevious Conference: Olympic. Doesn't meet either condition.\n\nRow 3: Kokomo\nYear Joined: 1926. Not less than, so doesn't fit.\nPrevious Conference: independents.\n\nRow 4: Logansport Community\nYear Joined: 1926. Again, not less than.\nPrevious Conference: independents.\n\nRow 5: Marion\nYear Joined: 1933. That's after 1926, so nope.\nPrevious Conference: independents.\n\nRow 6: Muncie Central\nYear Joined: 1926. Same as above.\nPrevious Conference: independents.\n\nRow 7: New Castle Chrysler\nYear Joined: 1926. Doesn't fit the year condition.\nPrevious Conference: independents.\n\nRow 8: Richmond\nYear Joined: 1926. So, same issue as others here; not less than 1926.\nPrevious Conference: independents.\n\nWait a minute... Looking at all rows, I don't see any school where the year joined is less than 1926. The earliest is 1926 in multiple rows, but none before that. So for both conditions (year <1926 and previous conference = independents), there are no schools meeting both.\n\nTherefore, there's no county in the table that satisfies these conditions. Hence, the claim cannot be TRUE because it's asserting that such a county exists as 35 huntington, but since none do, the statement is FALSE.\n\nWait another thought: maybe I misread the claim. Let me re-examine it. The claim says \"the / county that have a year join less than 1926, and a previous conference of independent be 35 huntington.\" Perhaps this means that for counties with these two attributes (year <1926 and previous conference = independents), their county is 35 huntington. But since no schools meet both conditions, the claim is asserting something about a non-existent set. Therefore, it's FALSE.\n\nAdditionally, if I look at row 2: Huntington North has County 35 huntington. Let me check its details:\n\nRow 2:\nYear Joined: 2003 (which is greater than 1926)\nPrevious Conference: Olympic\nSo, this school doesn't meet the criteria either.\n\nThus, there are no schools that have both a year joined less than 1926 and a previous conference of independents. Therefore, the claim that such counties are 35 huntington is FALSE because those conditions don't apply to any county in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"previous conference\"}]}",

Kokomo is a different school altogether, as seen in Row 3.\n\nNext, checking the year joined: The claim says Huntington North joined in 2003.
