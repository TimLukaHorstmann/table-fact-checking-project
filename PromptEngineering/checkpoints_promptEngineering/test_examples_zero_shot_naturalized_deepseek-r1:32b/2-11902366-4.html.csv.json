Scanning row by row:\n- Row 9 has a date of November 17. That's our target row for this claim.\n\n**Step 2: Verifying Teams Involved**\nIn Row 9, under the 'visitor' column, it says \"new jersey\". The 'home' team is listed as \"philadelphia\". So, on November 17, New Jersey was visiting Philadelphia. This matches the teams mentioned in the claim.\n\n**Step 3: Checking Attendance**\nThe 'attendance' for Row 9 is 19621, which exactly matches the number stated in the claim (19,621). \n\nAll three components of the claim are accurately represented in Row 9.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the highest attended game in the new jersey devils'07 - 08 season be against philadelphia\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that the game with the highest attendance during the '07-'08 season was against Philadelphia. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game played by the New Jersey Devils. The relevant columns here are \"date\", \"visitor\", \"score\", \"home\", and \"attendance\". \n\nI need to find all games where the opponent (visitor or home) is Philadelphia and then check their attendance numbers. Also, I should identify which game had the highest attendance overall in the season to compare.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n1. Row 1: Home is New Jersey vs. Toronto. Attendance is 14523.\n2. Row 2: Visitor is New Jersey vs. NY Rangers. Attendance is 18200.\n3. Row 3: Visitor is Pittsburgh vs. New Jersey. Attendance is 14032.\n4. Row 4: Visitor is Philadelphia vs. New Jersey. This looks like a home game for the Devils against Philadelphia. The attendance here is 14948.\n5. Row 5: Visitor is New Jersey vs. NY Islanders. Attendance is 15361.\n6. Row 6: Visitor is New Jersey vs. Pittsburgh. Decision was Weekes, but I need to check the opponent and attendance. Attendance is 17096.\n7. Row 7: Visitor is NY Rangers vs. New Jersey. Attendance is 17625.\n8. Row 8: Visitor is NY Islanders vs. New Jersey. Attendance is 15076.\n9. Row 9: Visitor is New Jersey vs. Philadelphia. This seems like an away game, but the attendance isn't directly relevant here since we're looking for games involving New Jersey as either home or visitor. The attendance is 19621.\n10. Row 10: Visitor is New Jersey vs. Pittsburgh. Attendance is 17132.\n11. Row 11: Visitor is New Jersey vs. Atlanta. Attendance is 18545.\n12. Row 12: Visitor is New Jersey vs. Tampa Bay. Attendance is 19077.\n13. Row 13: Visitor is Dallas vs. New Jersey. Attendance is 13665.\n14. Row 14: Visitor is Montreal vs. New Jersey. Attendance is 15081.\n\nNow, looking for games against Philadelphia:\n- In row 4, the game is against Philadelphia at home with attendance 14948.\n- In row 9, the game is away against Philadelphia with attendance 19621.\n\nBut wait, actually, in row 9, New Jersey is the visitor. So that's a game where they played as visitors against Philadelphia. The attendance for that game was 19621.\n\nNow, I need to find the highest attendance across all games. Let's list all attendances:\n\n- Row 1: 14523\n- Row 2: 18200\n- Row 3: 14032\n- Row 4: 14948\n- Row 5: 15361\n- Row 6: 17096\n- Row 7: 17625\n- Row 8: 15076\n- Row 9: 19621\n- Row 10: 17132\n- Row 11: 18545\n- Row 12: 19077\n- Row 13: 13665\n- Row 14: 15081\n\nThe highest attendance is in row 9 with 19621. So the claim states that the highest attended game was against Philadelphia, which matches because in row 9 they played against Philadelphia and had the highest attendance.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if any other games against Philadelphia have higher attendances than others but maybe not the overall maximum.\n\nLooking back, only two games are against Philadelphia:\n\n- Row 4: Home vs. Philadelphia with 14948\n- Row 9: Away vs. Philadelphia with 19621\n\nAnd since row 9 has the highest attendance in the entire table (19621), it's correct that their game against Philadelphia had the highest attendance.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"row_4\": {\"visitor\": \"Philadelphia\", \"attendance\": 14948}, \"row_9\": {\"visitor\": \"Philadelphia\", \"attendance\": 19621}}\n\nThe claim is TRUE.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the new jersey devil play at home 7 times during the 07-08 season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that New Jersey played 7 home games in the 2007-2008 season. The table given seems to list a series of hockey games with details like date, visitor, score, home team, decision, attendance, and record for each game.\n\nLooking at the structure of the table, each row represents a single game. There are 14 rows in total, each corresponding to a different date between November 2 and November 30. The columns include \"date\", \"visitor\", \"score\", \"home\", \"decision\", \"attendance\", and \"record\".\n\nThe key part here is to identify how many times New Jersey played at home. In the table, the \"home\" column specifies which team was the home team for each game. So I need to count the number of rows where the \"home\" value is \"new jersey.\"\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n1. Row 1: Home is new jersey\n2. Row 2: Visitor is new jersey (they're away)\n3. Row 3: Home is new jersey\n4. Row 4: Home is new jersey\n5. Row 5: Visitor is new jersey\n6. Row 6: Visitor is new jersey\n7. Row 7: Home is new jersey\n8. Row 8: Home is new jersey\n9. Row 9: Visitor is new jersey\n10. Row 10: Visitor is new jersey\n11. Row 11: Visitor is new jersey\n12. Row 12: Visitor is new jersey\n13. Row 13: Home is new jersey\n14. Row 14: Home is new jersey\n\nNow, let's count the rows where \"home\" is \"new jersey\":\n\n- Rows 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 13, and 14.\n\nThat makes a total of 7 games where New Jersey was the home team. The claim states they played at home 7 times during the season, which matches our count here. \n\nI should also consider if there might be any other rows or data that could affect this count. Looking again, each row clearly specifies whether New Jersey is the visitor or the home team, so I don't see any ambiguity. Each time they are listed as \"home,\" it's a separate game.\n\nTherefore, the claim appears to be accurate based on the provided table.\n</think>\n\nThe table lists 14 games where New Jersey was either the home or visiting team. Counting the instances where \"home\" is \"new jersey\" gives exactly 7 games. Hence, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"home\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"in their 07 - 08 season, the new jersey devil never finish a game without score\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that the New Jersey Devils didn't have any games in the '07-'08 season where they finished without scoring. In other words, in every game they played, they scored at least one goal.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game. The relevant columns are \"home\", \"visitor\", and \"score\". The home team is listed under the \"home\" column, and the visitor is the opponent. The score is given as visitor's goals - home's goals.\n\nThe claim is about New Jersey's games, so I need to check all rows where either the home or visitor is \"new jersey\".\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Home is new jersey, Visitor is Toronto. Score: 2-3. NJ scored 3.\n2. **Row 2**: Visitor is new jersey, Home is NY Rangers. Score: 1-2. NJ scored 1.\n3. **Row 3**: Home is new jersey, Visitor is Pittsburgh. Score: 5-0. NJ scored 0? Wait, that can't be right because the score shows 5-0, so home (NJ) has 0 goals. That would mean they didn't score in this game.\n4. **Row 4**: Home is new jersey, Visitor is Philadelphia. Score: 1-4. NJ scored 4.\n5. **Row 5**: Visitor is new jersey, Home is NY Islanders. Score: 1-2. NJ scored 2.\n6. **Row 6**: Visitor is new jersey, Home is Pittsburgh. Score: 3-2. NJ scored 3.\n7. **Row 7**: Visitor is NY Rangers, Home is new jersey. Score: 4-2. Wait, the score here is visitor (NYR) 4 - home (NJ) 2? So NJ scored 2 goals.\n8. **Row 8**: Visitor is NY Islanders, Home is new jersey. Score: 1-0. NJ scored 0. Oh no, that's another game where they didn't score.\n9. **Row 9**: Visitor is new jersey, Home is Philadelphia. Score: 6-2. They scored 6.\n10. **Row 10**: Visitor is new jersey, Home is Pittsburgh. Score: 2-1. They scored 2.\n11. **Row 11**: Visitor is new jersey, Home is Atlanta. Score: 3-0. They scored 3.\n12. **Row 12**: Visitor is new jersey, Home is Tampa Bay. Score: 3-2. They scored 3.\n13. **Row 13**: Visitor is Dallas, Home is new jersey. Score: 2-4. NJ scored 4.\n14. **Row 14**: Visitor is Montreal, Home is new jersey. Score: 0-4. NJ scored 4.\n\nWait a second, I noticed in Row 3 and Row 8, New Jersey didn't score any goals. In Row 3, the home team (NJ) had a score of 0 against Pittsburgh. In Row 8, as the home team, they were beaten by NY Islanders with a score of 1-0. So that's two games where NJ Devils finished without scoring.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there are instances where New Jersey didn't score in their games during the '07-'08 season.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the New Jersey Devils never finished a game without scoring during the 2007-08 season. However, examining the table shows two instances (Row 3 and Row 8) where New Jersey scored zero goals, meaning they didn't score in those games.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: Look for all rows where \"home\" or \"visitor\" is \"new jersey\".\n2. **Check Scores**: For each relevant row, check the score to see if New Jersey (NJ) scored any goals.\n3. **Find Counterexamples**: Found two games (Rows 3 and 8) where NJ's score was 0.\n\n**Relevant cells:**\n- Row 3: Home is new jersey with a score of 5-0, meaning NJ scored 0.\n- Row 8: Home is new jersey with a score of 1-0, meaning NJ scored 0.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine whether the claim \"the game with attendance of more than 19000 be all loss\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems to state that any game where the attendance was over 19,000 resulted in a loss for the home team, New Jersey. So, my goal is to check each row of the table where attendance exceeds 19,000 and verify if all those games ended with a loss.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row contains details like date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record. The key columns here are \"attendance\" and \"score,\" as well as possibly \"record.\"\n\nI'll start by identifying all rows where attendance is more than 19,000. Let's go through each row:\n\n- Row 2: Attendance is 18,200 (November 3). That's below 19k.\n- Row 6: Attendance is 17,096 (November 12). Also below.\n- Row 7: Attendance is 17,625 (November 14). Still under.\n- Row 8: 15,076 \u2013 nope.\n- Row 9: 19,621. This exceeds 19k.\n- Row 10: 17,132. No.\n- Row 11: 18,545. Below.\n- Row 12: 19,077. That's just over 19k.\n\nSo, only rows 9 and 12 have attendance above 19,000.\n\nNow, I need to check the outcomes of these games for New Jersey as the home team.\n\nFor row 9 (November 17):\n- Visitor: Philadelphia\n- Score: 6 - 2. Since New Jersey is the home team and they scored more points (6), this was a win for them.\n\nRow 12 (November 24):\n- Visitor: Tampa Bay\n- Score: 3 - 2. Again, New Jersey as home with 3 goals, so another win.\n\nBoth games where attendance was over 19k resulted in wins for the home team. Therefore, the claim that such games were all losses is incorrect.\n\nAdditionally, looking at other rows to ensure there are no other high attendances missed:\n\n- Row 2: 18,200 \u2013 under.\n- Rows beyond 9 and 12 don't exceed 19k except for row 9 and 12 as we've checked.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because both games with attendance over 19k resulted in wins, not losses.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"no game be play on november 17 through 20th\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that no games were played from November 17th to November 20th. My task is to check the table and see if there are any games within those dates.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, visitor, home team, etc. The rows are indexed from 0 to 13 (since there are 14 rows in total). I'll go through each row's date column to check for any dates between November 17 and November 20.\n\nStarting with Row 9: the date is november 17. That falls exactly on the start of the period mentioned. So, this row is relevant because it shows a game was played on November 17th.\n\nNext, I need to check if there are any games between November 18 and November 20. Let me scan through the other rows quickly:\n\nRow 10: november 21 \u2013 that's after November 20.\nRow 11: november 23 \u2013 also after.\nRows before Row 9: dates go up to november 16, which is before the period.\n\nSo, only Row 9 falls within the specified range. This means there was at least one game played on November 17th, and none on the subsequent days until November 20th. Therefore, the claim that \"no games were played\" from November 17 to 20 is FALSE because a game did take place on the 17th.\n\nI should also note which cells are relevant for this determination. The key information comes from the 'date' column in Row 9, which shows that a game was indeed held on November 17th. There's no need to look at other columns since the date alone is sufficient to disprove the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there was a game played on November 17th.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the lowest attendance game be play against the new jersey devil\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what each row in the table represents. Each row corresponds to a specific game played on a particular date. The columns include details like the date, visitor team, score, home team, decision-maker (probably the goalie), attendance, and record.\n\nThe claim is about the lowest attendance being for a game against the New Jersey Devils. So I need to check two things: what was the lowest attendance, and which game(s) had that attendance.\n\nLooking at each row's 'attendance' column:\n\nRow 1: 14,523\nRow 2: 18,200\nRow 3: 14,032\nRow 4: 14,948\nRow 5: 15,361\nRow 6: 17,096\nRow 7: 17,625\nRow 8: 15,076\nRow 9: 19,621\nRow 10: 17,132\nRow 11: 18,545\nRow 12: 19,077\nRow 13: 13,665\nRow 14: 15,081\n\nThe lowest attendance here is 13,665 in Row 13. Now, I need to check if this game was against the New Jersey Devils.\n\nIn each row, the home team and visitor are listed. The New Jersey Devils would be either the 'home' or the 'visitor'. So for Row 13:\n\nHome: new jersey\nVisitor: dallas\n\nSo yes, the home team is New Jersey, meaning it's a game against them as hosts.\n\nWait, but I should check all games to ensure that this is indeed the lowest. Let me list all attendances again:\n\nRow 1: 14,523\nRow 2: 18,200\nRow 3: 14,032\nRow 4: 14,948\nRow 5: 15,361\nRow 6: 17,096\nRow 7: 17,625\nRow 8: 15,076\nRow 9: 19,621\nRow 10: 17,132\nRow 11: 18,545\nRow 12: 19,077\nRow 13: 13,665\nRow 14: 15,081\n\nThe lowest is definitely Row 13 with 13,665. Now, in this row, the home team is New Jersey, so it's a game they played against Dallas as the visitors.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct because the lowest attendance was during a game involving the New Jersey Devils.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the lowest attendance game involved the New Jersey Devils. By examining each row, we find that the game on November 28 had the lowest attendance of 13,665, with New Jersey as the home team. Thus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"home\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the new jersey devil play more away game than home game in the 07 - 08 season",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the New Jersey Devils play more away games than home games in the 07-08 season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what's being asked here.\n\nFirst, the table seems to list games played by the New Jersey team (probably the New Jersey Devils) during a certain period, likely the 2007-2008 hockey season since that's what the claim refers to. Each row represents a game with details like date, visitor, home, score, etc.\n\nThe claim is about whether they played more away games than home games in that season. So, I need to count how many times New Jersey was the visitor (away) and how many times they were the home team.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Row 1: Home is New Jersey, so this is a home game.\n2. Row 2: Visitor is New Jersey, so away.\n3. Row 3: Visitor is Pittsburgh; home is NJ, so home.\n4. Row 4: Visitor is Philadelphia; home is NJ, so home.\n5. Row 5: Visitor is NJ, so away.\n6. Row 6: Visitor is NJ, away.\n7. Row 7: Visitor is NY Rangers; home is NJ, so home.\n8. Row 8: Visitor is NY Islanders; home is NJ, so home.\n9. Row 9: Visitor is NJ, away.\n10. Row 10: Visitor is NJ, away.\n11. Row 11: Visitor is NJ, away.\n12. Row 12: Visitor is NJ, away.\n13. Row 13: Home is NJ, so home.\n14. Row 14: Home is NJ, so home.\n\nNow counting:\n\nHome games:\nRows 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 13, 14 \u2192 that's 7 home games.\n\nAway games:\nRows 2,5,6,9,10,11,12 \u2192 that's 7 away games.\n\nWait, so it's equal? Hmm. But the claim says \"more away than home.\" If they played equally, then the claim is FALSE because \"more\" implies more, not equal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed something. Let me recount:\n\nHome games:\nRow 1: Home\nRow 3: Home\nRow 4: Home\nRow7: Home\nRow8: Home\nRow13: Home\nRow14: Home \u2192 Total of 7.\n\nAway games:\nRow2: Visitor (NJ)\nRow5: Visitor\nRow6: Visitor\nRow9: Visitor\nRow10: Visitor\nRow11: Visitor\nRow12: Visitor \u2192 That's also 7.\n\nSo, equal number. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because they didn't play more away games; it was the same number.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that New Jersey played an equal number of home and away games during the specified period. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"home\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "a shutout game be when a team do not score at all during a game the new jersey devil lose 3 game this way , score no point",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break down the claim first.\n\nThe claim says: \"a shutout game be when a team do not score at all during a game the new jersey devil lose 3 game this way, score no point.\"\n\nHmm, okay. So there are two parts here. First, defining a shutout game as when one team doesn't score at all. Second, stating that the New Jersey Devils lost three games this way and scored no points in those games.\n\nWait, but in sports like hockey, if a team is shut out, they score zero goals. But do they necessarily lose all those games? Or can it be either win or loss?\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a 'score' column which shows the visitor's score and the home's score. The home team here is sometimes New Jersey, sometimes another team.\n\nFirst, I need to find all games where the home team is New Jersey and they didn't score any goals (shutout for them). Alternatively, if the visitor is New Jersey and the opponent shut them out, meaning New Jersey scored zero.\n\nWait, no. The claim says \"the new jersey devil lose 3 game this way.\" So it's when NJ lost because they were shut out\u2014meaning in those games, their score was zero.\n\nSo I need to look for rows where either:\n\n1. Home team is New Jersey and their score is 0 (so visitor scored all goals), meaning NJ lost at home.\n2. Visitor is New Jersey and their score is 0 (so opponent as home team scored, making NJ lose away).\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: date: november 2, visitor: toronto, score: 2 - 3, home: new jersey. So home is NJ, but they scored 3, so not a shutout for them.\n\nRow 2: visitor: new jersey, score: 1 - 2, home: ny rangers. So NJ as visitor scored 1, opponent scored 2. Not a shutout for NJ.\n\nRow 3: visitor: pittsburgh, score:5-0, home:new jersey. Here, NJ is home and scored 0. So this is a shutout loss for them.\n\nRow4: visitor:philadelphia, score:1 -4, home:NJ.NJ scored 4, so not a shutout.\n\nRow5:visitor: NJ, score:1-2, home: ny islanders. NJ scored 1, not a shutout.\n\nRow6:visitor:NJ, score:3-2, home:pittsburgh.NJ won here, but their score was 3, so no shutout.\n\nRow7:visitor:ny rangers, score:4-2, home:NJ.NJ scored 2, not a shutout.\n\nRow8:visitor:ny islanders, score:1-0, home:NJ.NJ scored 0. So another shutout loss.\n\nRow9:visitor:NJ, score:6-2, home:philadelphia.NJ scored 6, so no.\n\nRow10:visitor:NJ, score:2-1, home:pittsburgh.NJ won, but scored 2, not a shutout.\n\nRow11:visitor:NJ, score:3-0, home:atlanta.NJ scored 3, opponent 0. So Atlanta was shut out, but NJ scored and won. Not a loss for NJ.\n\nRow12:visitor:NJ, score:3-2, home:tampa bay.NJ won, so not a loss.\n\nRow13:visitor:dallas, score:2-4, home:NJ.NJ scored 4, not a shutout.\n\nRow14:visitor:montreal, score:0 -4, home:NJ.NJ scored 4; opponent scored 0. So another shutout for NJ as the home team.\n\nWait, in row3, NJ was home and lost 5-0 (score:5-0). In row8, NJ was home and lost 1-0. In row14, NJ was home and won 4-0 against Montreal. Wait, no\u2014row14's score is 0 -4? Or is it visitor's score first or home's?\n\nWait the 'score' column is written as \"visitor_score - home_score\". So in row3: visitor pittsburgh scored 5, home NJ scored 0.\n\nRow8: visitor ny islanders scored 1, home NJ scored 0. So that's another shutout loss for NJ at home.\n\nRow14: visitor montreal scored 0, home NJ scored 4. That means NJ won with a shutout, so they didn't lose this game.\n\nSo how many times did NJ lose because of a shutout?\n\nFrom the table:\n\nRow3: score 5-0 (visitor pittsburgh). So NJ as home team scored 0, lost. Count 1.\n\nRow8: visitor ny islanders scored 1, NJ scored 0. So another loss by shutout. Count 2.\n\nIs there a third? Let me check again.\n\nWait row14 is a win for NJ with a shutout (they scored 4, opponent 0). So that's not a loss.\n\nAre there any other rows where NJ as home or visitor scored zero?\n\nRow5: visitor NJ scored 1, home ny islanders scored 2. Not a shutout for NJ.\n\nRow2: visitor NJ scored 1, home ny rangers scored 2. Not a shutout.\n\nSo only two instances where NJ lost by shutout: row3 and row8.\n\nBut the claim says they lost three games this way. So that would make the claim FALSE because there are only two such games.\n\nWait wait\u2014did I miss any?\n\nLet me double-check all rows:\n\n1. Home NJ, score 2-3: NJ scored 3, not a shutout loss.\n2. Visitor NJ, score 1-2: not a shutout for NJ (they scored).\n3. Visitor pittsburgh, score5-0: NJ home, 0 goals. Shutout loss.\n4. Visitor philadelphia, score1-4: NJ scored 4, no.\n5. Visitor NJ, score1-2: not a shutout.\n6. Visitor NJ, score3-2: won, so no.\n7. Visitor ny rangers, score4-2: NJ home, scored 2.\n8. Visitor ny islanders, score1-0: NJ home, 0 goals. Shutout loss.\n9. Visitor NJ, score6-2: won, not a shutout.\n10. Visitor NJ, score2-1: won, no.\n11. Visitor NJ, score3-0: won with opponent shutout, so not a loss for NJ.\n12. Visitor NJ, score3-2: won.\n13. Visitor dallas, score2-4: NJ scored 4, no.\n14. Visitor montreal, score0-4: NJ home, 4 goals. Opponent shutout, but NJ won.\n\nSo only two games where NJ was shut out and lost: rows 3 and 8.\n\nTherefore, the claim says they lost three games this way, which is incorrect. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the New Jersey Devils lost three games by being shut out. After reviewing the table, we found only two instances where NJ lost due to a shutout (rows 3 and 8). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
