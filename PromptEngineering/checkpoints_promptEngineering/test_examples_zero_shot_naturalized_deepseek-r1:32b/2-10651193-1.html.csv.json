    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"there be no player draft from tennessee state with a rank lower than 261\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that there are no players drafted from Tennessee State University who have an overall ranking (I assume \"rank\" refers to the \"overall\" column in the table) lower than 261. So, we're looking for any player from Tennessee State with an overall rank greater than 261.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row of the table one by one to check if there's a player from Tennessee State and what their overall rank is.\n\nRow 1: Player is Willis Adams from Houston, overall rank 20. Not relevant since it's not Tennessee State.\n\nRow 2: Lawrence Johnson from Wisconsin, overall 40. Not relevant.\n\nRow 3: Sam Claphan from Oklahoma, overall 47. No.\n\nRow 4: Jim Ramey from Kentucky, overall 70. No.\n\nRow 5: Matt Miller from Colorado, overall 95. No.\n\nRow 6: Rich Dimler from USC, overall 124. No.\n\nRow 7: Clinton Burrell from LSU, overall 151. No.\n\nRow 8: Jim Ronan from Minnesota, overall 163. No.\n\nRow 9: Cody Risien from Texas A&M, overall 183. No.\n\nRow 10: Kent Perkov from San Diego State, overall 204. No.\n\nRow 11: Carl McGee from Duke, overall 234. No.\n\nRow 12: Curtis Weathers from Mississippi, overall 241. No.\n\nRow 13: John Henry Smith from Tennessee State, overall 261. Wait, this is the first player from Tennessee State I see. His overall rank is exactly 261.\n\nRow 14: Randy Poeschl from Nebraska, overall 287. Not relevant.\n\nRow 15: Dee Methvin from Tulane, overall 315. No.\n\nSo, in the table, there's only one player from Tennessee State, which is John Henry Smith, and his overall rank is 261. The claim says that no player from Tennessee State has a rank lower than 261. Since 261 is exactly at that point, not lower, it means that there are indeed no players from Tennessee State with an overall rank below 261.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
