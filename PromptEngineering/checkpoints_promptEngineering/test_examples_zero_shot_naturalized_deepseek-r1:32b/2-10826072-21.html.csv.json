Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table and find the venues mentioned. The table has six rows, each representing a different game with details like home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific venues: arden street oval and junction oval.

Now, I need to check the crowd numbers for these two rows.\n\nLooking at row 5 (arden street oval), the crowd is listed as 8733. For row 6 (junction oval), the crowd is 22413. \n\nThe claim states that arden street oval's game had a smaller crowd than junction oval's. Comparing the two numbers: 8733 (arden) vs. 22413 (junction). Clearly, 8733 is less than 22413, so the claim holds true.\n\nTo be thorough, I should also check if there are any other instances of these venues in the table. But looking back, each venue appears only once, so rows 5 and 6 are the only relevant ones for this claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE because the crowd at arden street oval (8733) is indeed smaller than the crowd at junction oval (22413).\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is comparing two crowds: one at Junction Oval and another at Kardinia Park. It says that the crowd at Junction Oval is three times bigger than the crowd at Kardinia Park.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are six rows, each representing a different game on August 21, 1971. Each row has details like home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd size, and date.\n\nI need to find two specific rows: one where the venue is Junction Oval and another where the venue is Kardinia Park.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Venue is Moorabbin Oval. Not relevant.\nRow 2: Venue is MCG. Not relevant.\nRow 3: Venue is Victoria Park. Not relevant.\nRow 4: Venue is Kardinia Park. Here, the crowd size is 17,864.\nRow 5: Venue is Arden Street Oval. Not relevant.\nRow 6: Venue is Junction Oval. The crowd size here is 22,413.\n\nSo, I found both venues in Row 4 and Row 6.\n\nNow, the claim says the crowd at Junction Oval (which is 22,413) should be three times bigger than Kardinia Park's crowd (17,864). Let me check if 22,413 is approximately three times 17,864.\n\nCalculating: 17,864 multiplied by 3 equals 53,592. But the crowd at Junction Oval is only 22,413, which is less than half of that number. So, it's not even close to being three times bigger; in fact, it's about 1.26 times bigger (since 22,413 / 17,864 \u2248 1.255).\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the crowd at Junction Oval isn't three times larger than that at Kardinia Park.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row 4, column \"crowd\" for Kardinia Park's crowd size.\n- Row 6, column \"crowd\" for Junction Oval's crowd size.\n\nI'll list these in the relevant_cells array with their respective row indices and column names.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim mentions three venues: Victoria Park, Kardinia Park, and MCG (Melbourne Cricket Ground). For each of these venues, I'll look up their respective crowd numbers from the table.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 3 is about Victoria Park. It shows a crowd of 41,312.\n- Row 4 mentions Kardinia Park with a crowd of 17,864.\n- Row 2 lists MCG's crowd as 37,732.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the combined crowd for Kardinia Park and MCG.

To check this, I'll calculate if 22,413 is twice 17,864 or more.\n\nCalculating twice of Kardinia's crowd: 17,864 * 2 = 35,728. Now, compare that to Junction Oval's crowd: 22,413. Is 22,413 greater than or equal to 35,728? No, it's not. So, the crowd at Junction Oval wasn't two times larger.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I misread the claim. It says \"have 2 time a larger,\" which could mean twice as large. But mathematically, twice as large would be 2x, so if Kardinia had X, Junction should have at least 2X. Since 22k is less than 35k, it's not twice as large.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the crowd at Junction Oval (22,413) was not two times larger than that at Kardinia Park (17,864).\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
