    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"bok\u0161i\u0107 be the only player to score 8 goal in the league\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It says that bok\u0161i\u0107 is the only player who scored 8 goals in the league. So I need to check two things: did bok\u0161i\u0107 score 8 goals in the league, and is he the only one with that number of goals?\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different player with their respective statistics across four columns: name, league, fa cup, league cup, and total. The 'league' column shows how many goals each player scored in the league.\n\nStarting with bok\u0161i\u0107. Row 1 has name: bok\u0161i\u0107, league: 8. So yes, he scored 8 goals in the league. That part checks out.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that no other player has a 'league' value of 8. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Row 2: whelan - league:4\n- Row3: n\u00e9meth - league:3\n- Row4: ince - league:2\n- Row5: cooper - league:2\n- Row6: queudrue - league:2\n- Row7: marinelli - league:2\n- Row8: mustoe - league:2\n- Row9: deane - league:1\n- Row10: johnston - league:1\n- Row11: greening - league:1\n- Row12: stockdale - league:1\n- Row13: festa - league:1\n- Row14: windass - league:1\n- Row15: southgate - league:1\n- Row16: carbone - league:1\n- Row17: ehiogu - league:1\n- Row18: murphy - league:0 (he scored in the league cup though)\n- Row19: wilson - league:0\n- Row20: cambell - league:0, but he scored 1 in FA Cup\n- Row21: own goals - league:1\n\nFrom this, it looks like all other players have a 'league' value of less than 8. The highest after bok\u0161i\u0107 is whelan with 4, and then several others with lower numbers down to 0 or 1.\n\nSo, since bok\u0161i\u0107 has 8 goals in the league and no one else does, the claim is TRUE. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are row 1's 'league' column to confirm his 8 goals and checking all other rows' 'league' columns to ensure none have 8.\n\nI think that covers everything needed to verify the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that bok\u0161i\u0107 is the only player who scored 8 goals in the league. The table shows that bok\u0161i\u0107 indeed scored 8 goals, and no other players have this number in their respective 'league' column. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"league\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"whelan be the only player to score 3 goal in the fa cup\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has rows representing different players with columns for name, league goals, FA Cup goals, League Cup goals, and total goals. The claim specifically mentions the FA Cup, so I should focus on that column.\n\nThe claim states that \"whelan\" is the only player who scored 3 goals in the FA Cup. So, my first step is to check if there's a player named Whelan in the table and what their FA Cup goal count is.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n- Row 2 has the name 'whelan', with FA Cup goals as 3. That matches the claim.\n  \nNext, I need to verify if any other players have scored exactly 3 goals in the FA Cup. To do this, I'll scan each row's FA Cup column:\n\nRow 1: 0\nRow 2: 3 (Whelan)\nRows 3-8: All have either 0 or numbers less than 3.\nRow 9 onwards: The FA Cup goals are all 0 except for Row 21, which has FA Cup as 1.\n\nWait, looking again at the table provided:\n\nRow 14: fa cup is 0\nRow 20: fa cup is 0\nRow 21: fa cup is 1 (Own Goals)\n\nI don't see any other player with 3 goals in the FA Cup except Whelan. So, it seems like Whelan is indeed the only one.\n\nBut I need to be thorough. Let me go through each row again:\n\n- Row 1: bok\u0161i\u0107 - fa cup 0\n- Row 2: whelan - 3 (FA Cup)\n- Row 3: n\u00e9meth - 1\n- Row 4: ince - 1\n- Row 5: cooper - 0\n- Row 6: queudrue - 0\n- Row 7: marinelli - 0\n- Row 8: mustoe - 0\n- Row 9: deane - 0\n- Row 10: johnston - 0\n- Row 11: greening - 0\n- Row 12: stockdale - 0\n- Row 13: festa - 0\n- Row 14: windass - 0\n- Row 15: southgate - 0\n- Row 16: carbone - 0\n- Row 17: ehiogu - 0\n- Row 18: murphy - 0 (FA Cup is 0, League Cup is 1)\n- Row 19: wilson - 0\n- Row 20: cambell - FA Cup 1\n- Row 21: own goals - FA Cup 1\n\nSo, only Row 2 (whelan) has 3 FA Cup goals. No other player has that number.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Whelan is indeed the only player with exactly 3 FA Cup goals.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"}]}",

Looking at the table, row 7 is marinelli and row 10 is johnston. \n\nNow, I need to check their total goals. For marinelli, the 'total' column shows 2 goals. For johnston, it's also 1 goal. Wait, that doesn't add up because 2 minus 1 is 1.

I need to determine if the claim \"cambell score 1 less goal than ehiogu in the league\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. Each row represents a player with their goals in different competitions: league, FA cup, league cup, and total. The claim specifically mentions the league goals for two players: cambell and ehiogu.\n\nI need to find the relevant rows for these two players. Let me scan through the table:\n\n- Looking at each name:\n  - Row 18: murphy\n  - Row 19: wilson\n  - Row 20: cambell\n  - Row 21: own goals (probably not a player)\n  \nWait, I might have missed ehiogu. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nRow 4 is ince, row 5 cooper, row 6 queudrue, row 7 marinelli, row 8 mustoe, row 9 deane, row10 johnston, row11 greening, row12 stockdale, row13 festa, row14 windass, row15 southgate, row16 carbone, row17 ehiogu. Okay, so ehiogu is in row 17.\n\nNow, checking the league goals for each:\n\n- cambell (row 20): league column has 0.\n- ehiogu (row 17): league column also has 1.\n\nThe claim says \"cambell score 1 less goal than ehiogu in the league.\" So, if ehiogu scored 1, then cambell should have scored 0. That's exactly what the table shows: cambell has 0 and ehiogu has 1. Therefore, the claim is correct.\n\nI need to collect the relevant cells:\n\n- For cambell, row index 20 (assuming rows start at 0), column \"league\".\n- For ehiogu, row index 17, same column.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- {\"row_index\":20, \"column_name\":\"league\"}\n- {\"row_index\":17, \"column_name\":\"league\"}\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"league\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It states that four players\u2014Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, and Queudrue\u2014all have a total of 2 goals each. So my task is to check each of these names in the table and verify if their 'total' column indeed shows 2.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has columns for name, league, fa cup, league cup, and total. The rows are numbered from 1 to 21, with each containing a player's data.\n\nI'll start by locating each of these four players in the table:\n\n1. **Cooper**: Scanning through the rows, I find Cooper at Row 5. Checking the 'total' column here shows it's 2. So that's correct for Cooper.\n\n2. **Marinelli**: Next up is Marinelli. I check the rows and locate him at Row 7. His total goals are also listed as 2. That matches the claim.\n\n3. **Mustoe**: Now, looking for Mustoe. He appears in Row 8 with a 'total' of 2 goals. This aligns with what's claimed.\n\n4. **Queudrue**: The last player is Queudrue. I find him at Row 6. His total is also listed as 2 goals. So that checks out too.\n\nSince all four players\u2014Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, and Queudrue\u2014have a 'total' of 2 goals each according to the table, the claim seems to be supported. \n\nI should double-check to make sure I didn't miss any discrepancies or misread any rows.

The table has rows with each player's name and their goals across different competitions: league, FA cup, league cup, and total. Each row represents a player's statistics.\n\nThe claim states that bok\u0161i\u0107 is one of three players who scored 8 goals in the league. So, I need to check two things:\n1. How many goals did bok\u0161i\u0107 score in the league?\n2. How many other players also scored exactly 8 goals in the league?\n\nLooking at row 1 of the table (row index 0), under the \"league\" column, it shows that bok\u0161i\u0107 scored 8 goals. That's a good start.\n\nNext, I'll scan through each row to see if any other players have an '8' in their league column. Let's go through them one by one:\n- Row 2 (whelan): league = 4 \u2192 Not 8.\n- Row 3 (n\u00e9meth): league = 3 \u2192 Not 8.\n- Row 4 (ince): league = 2 \u2192 Not 8.\n- Row 5 (cooper): league = 2 \u2192 Not 8.\n- Row 6 (queudrue): league = 2 \u2192 Not 8.\n- Row 7 (marinelli): league = 2 \u2192 Not 8.\n- Row 8 (mustoe): league = 2 \u2192 Not 8.\n- Row 9 (deane): league = 1 \u2192 Not 8.\n- Rows 10 to 18: All have league goals of 1 or less, so none are 8.\n- Row 19 (murphy): league = 0 \u2192 Not 8.\n- Row 20 (wilson): league = 0 \u2192 Not 8.\n- Row 21 (cambell): league = 0 \u2192 Not 8.\n- The last row mentions own goals, but that's not a player.\n\nFrom this, it seems only bok\u0161i\u0107 has exactly 8 league goals.

It states that Whelan is the only player who scored exactly 3 goals in any of the competitions listed (league, FA cup, league cup). So, my task is to check two things:\n\n1. Does Whelan have exactly 3 goals in any competition?\n2. Is there any other player besides Whelan with exactly 3 goals in any competition?\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by locating Whelan's row. According to Row 2:\n- Name: whelan\n- League: 4 goals\n- FA cup: 3 goals\n- League cup: 0 goals\n- Total: 7 goals\n\nSo, Whelan scored 3 goals in the FA cup and 4 in the league, making his total 7. The claim mentions scoring 3 goals in \"any competition,\" which I interpret as at least one competition where he scored exactly 3.\n\nNow, I need to check if any other player has exactly 3 goals in any of their competitions. I'll go through each row:\n\nRow 1: bok\u0161i\u0107 \u2013 League:8, FA cup:0, League cup:0.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this table with various players and their goal statistics across different competitions. The claim is that Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, and Queudrue are the only players who scored 2 or more goals. My task is to check if this claim is true or false based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each of these four players mentioned: Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, and Queudrue. Let me find their rows in the table. \n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Row 5: Cooper has a league total of 2 goals, FA Cup and League Cup are 0 each, so total is 2.\n- Row 7: Marinelli also has 2 goals in the league, with others at 0, totaling 2.\n- Row 8: Mustoe similarly has 2 in the league, others 0, total 2.\n- Row 6: Queudrue is same as above, 2 in the league, others 0, total 2.\n\nSo each of these four players have exactly 2 goals. Now, I need to check if any other player has scored 2 or more goals. \n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nRow 1: Bok\u0161i\u0107 has 8 goals total.\nRow 2: Whelan has 7.\nRow 3: N\u00e9meth has 6.\nRow 4: Ince has 3.\nRows 5-8: Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, Queudrue each have 2.\n\nThen from Row 9 onwards, players have totals of 1 or less. \n\nWait a minute, Bok\u0161i\u0107 alone scored 8 goals, which is way more than 2. Similarly, Whelan and N\u00e9meth also have much higher totals. So the claim says that Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, and Queudrue are the only ones with 2 or more goals, but this isn't true because there are others with significantly higher goal counts.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be all the rows where total is 8 (Row1), 7 (Row2), 6 (Row3), and 3 (Row4). Each of these players has a total that's equal to or greater than 2, which contradicts the claim. \n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there are other players who have scored more than 2 goals.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, and Queudrue are the only players with 2 or more goals. However, Bok\u0161i\u0107, Whelan, N\u00e9meth, and Ince also meet this criterion.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
