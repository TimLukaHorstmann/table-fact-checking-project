    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with several rows of data about different football teams and their coaching changes. The claim is: \"the date of vacancy when the position in the table be 10th and the manner of departure be resign be 28 february 2011\". My task is to determine if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is looking for a row where two conditions are met: the \"position in table\" is 10th and the \"manner of departure\" is \"resign\". Then, it's checking if the corresponding \"date of vacancy\" for that row is February 28, 2011.\n\nLooking at each row one by one to see which ones meet both conditions. \n\nRow 1: Position is off-season and manner is sacked. Doesn't fit.\nRow 2: Position 15th, manner sacked. Not relevant.\nRow 3: Position 14th, manner sacked. No match.\nRow 4: Position 9th, manner resigned. Close but position isn't 10th.\nRow 5: Position 16th, manner sacked. Doesn't fit.\nRow 6: Position 16th, manner sacked. No good.\nRow 7: Position 13th, manner resigned. Not 10th.\nRow 8: Position 3rd, manner resigned. Doesn't match position.\nRow 9: Here we go. Position is 10th and manner of departure is \"resigned\". That matches both conditions. Now checking the date of vacancy for this row\u2014it's February 28, 2011. So that fits exactly with what the claim states.\n\nSo since Row 9 meets all the criteria\u2014position in table is 10th, manner is resign, and date of vacancy is 28 feb 2011\u2014the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the relevant cells where position is 10th and departure is resignation. The corresponding date matches February 28, 2011.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"position in table\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"manner of departure\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date of vacancy\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"the date of vacancy be 28 december 2011 with the incoming head coach be carlos azenha.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n1. The date of vacancy is December 28, 2011.\n2. The incoming head coach is Carlos Azenha.\n\nI need to check each row in the table to see if there's any instance where both these conditions are met.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Date of vacancy is July 7, 2010. Not matching December 28, 2011.\nRow 2: September 14, 2010. Doesn't match.\nRow 3: September 27, 2010. No.\nRow 4: December 21, 2010. Close but not the date in question.\nRow 5: December 19, 2010. Also doesn't fit.\nRow 6: Date of vacancy is December 28, 2011. That's a match for the first part. Now check incoming coach: Carlos Azenha. Yes, that's exactly who it says here. So both conditions are satisfied in this row.\n\nRows 7 to 10 have dates after February 2011 and March 2011, so none of them are December 28, 2011.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Row 6 has both the correct date of vacancy and incoming coach.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies two conditions: a date of vacancy on December 28, 2011, and an incoming head coach named Carlos Azenha. Checking each row in the table:\n\n- **Row 6** matches both conditions exactly.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date of vacancy\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"incoming head coach\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"when the team be uni\u00e3o de leiria, the date of appointment be 10 july 2010\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim. The claim mentions two things: the team is Uni\u00e3o de Leiria and the date of appointment is 10 July 2010. So, I need to check if these two pieces of information are correct for the same row in the table.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it's organized into rows, each representing a different team and details about their head coaches. Each row has columns like team, outgoing head coach, manner of departure, date of vacancy, position in table, incoming head coach, and date of appointment.\n\nI'll start by finding the row where the team is Uni\u00e3o de Leiria. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Team is Uni\u00e3o de Leiria. That's the one I need to focus on.\n\nNow, within this row, I need to check two things:\n1. The team name matches Uni\u00e3o de Leiria.\n2. The date of appointment is 10 July 2010.\n\nLooking at Row 1, under \"incoming head coach\" there's Pedro Caixinha, and the date of appointment is listed as 10 July 2010. So both conditions are met here.\n\nTo make sure I'm thorough, I'll cross-verify if any other rows have Uni\u00e3o de Leiria as the team. Scanning through Rows 2 to 10, none of them list Uni\u00e3o de Leiria again. So Row 1 is the only relevant row for this claim.\n\nTherefore, since the date of appointment (10 July 2010) does match when the team is Uni\u00e3o de Leiria in Row 1, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Row 1 confirms that when the team is Uni\u00e3o de Leiria, the date of appointment for the incoming head coach was indeed on 10 July 2010.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date of appointment\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"as the team be uni\u00e3o de leiria, the date of appointment be before 10 july 2010.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. It's saying that for the team Uni\u00e3o de Leiria, their incoming head coach was appointed before July 10, 2010. I'll need to check the table row corresponding to Uni\u00e3o de Leiria to find out when the new coach was appointed.\n\nLooking at the table, Row 1 is about Uni\u00e3o de Leiria. The outgoing coach is Lito Vidigal, who was sacked on July 7, 2010. The incoming head coach is Pedro Caixinha, and he was appointed on July 10, 2010.\n\nSo the claim says the date of appointment should be before July 10, but according to Row 1, it's exactly on July 10, not before. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because the appointment was on that date, not prior.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Uni\u00e3o de Leiria's incoming coach was appointed before July 10, 2010. However, the table shows Pedro Caixinha was appointed on July 10, 2010.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"incoming head coach\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date of appointment\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the date of vacancy be after 28 december 2011 with the incoming head coach, carlos azenha.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand each part of the claim. It's saying that there should be a row where the date of vacancy is after December 28, 2011, and the incoming head coach is Carlos Azenha.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to check for any instances where both conditions are met: date of vacancy > Dec 28, 2011, and incoming coach is Carlos Azenha.\n\nRow by row analysis:\n\nRow 1: Date of vacancy is July 7, 2010. Earlier than 2011. Doesn't fit.\nRow 2: September 14, 2010. Also earlier. No.\nRow 3: September 27, 2010. Again, before 2011. Not relevant.\nRow 4: December 21, 2010. Still in 2010. Doesn't qualify.\nRow 5: December 19, 2010. Same as above.\nRow 6: Date of vacancy is Dec 28, 2011. Wait, the claim says \"after\" Dec 28, so this is exactly on that date. So it doesn't satisfy being after. Also, incoming coach here is Carlos Azenha. But since the date isn't after, it doesn't meet both conditions.\nRow 7: February 20, 2011. This is before Dec 28, 2011. Doesn't apply.\nRow 8: Feb 26, 2011. Still earlier than required date.\nRow 9: Feb 28, 2011. Closer but still not after Dec 28, 2011.\nRow 10: March 1, 2011. Again, before the cutoff.\n\nLooking through all rows, only Row 6 mentions Carlos Azenha as incoming coach, but its vacancy date is exactly December 28, 2011, not after. The other rows don't have Carlos Azenha or their dates are too early. Therefore, there's no row where the date of vacancy is after Dec 28, 2011, and the incoming coach is Carlos Azenha.\n\nSo, the claim isn't supported by any data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim requires a date after December 28, 2011. The only relevant entry with Carlos Azenha as the incoming coach is on Dec 28, 2011, which doesn't satisfy \"after.\"\n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date of vacancy\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"incoming head coach\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
