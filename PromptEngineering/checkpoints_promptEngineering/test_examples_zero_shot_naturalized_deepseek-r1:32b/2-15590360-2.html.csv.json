    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"there be 0 pole in the moto2 class\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the table represents.\n\nThe table has several rows with different classes: 125 cc, 250 cc, motogp, moto2, and total. Each row includes details like the season, number of races, podiums, and poles.\n\nLooking at the claim specifically about \"moto2 class\" and whether there are 0 poles in that class. I need to find the relevant cell in the table for the moto2 class under the 'pole' column.\n\nFirst, I'll identify which row corresponds to the moto2 class. Scanning through the rows:\n\nRow 1: 125 cc\nRow 2: 250 cc\nRow 3: motogp\nRow 4: moto2\nRow 5: total\n\nSo, Row 4 is the one for moto2. Now, checking that row's 'pole' value. The columns are class, season, race, podiums, pole.\n\nIn Row 4, the 'pole' column shows a value of 0. This means in the moto2 class, there have been zero poles achieved according to the data provided.\n\nTherefore, the claim stating \"there be 0 pole in the moto2 class\" is supported by the table. The relevant cell for this verification is the 'pole' entry in Row 4.\n\nI don't think any other rows are needed because the claim specifically mentions moto2. So, only Row 4's 'pole' column is relevant here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pole\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"4 pole have a moto2 class\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the data in the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"4 pole have a moto2 class.\" I think this might be a bit unclear, but I'll interpret it as meaning that there are 4 poles (which in racing terms usually refers to pole positions) associated with the Moto2 class. So, the claim is asserting that in the Moto2 category, there were 4 pole positions.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided:\n\nRow 1: class: 125 cc, season: 2001, race: 1, podiums: 0, pole: 0.\nRow 2: class: 250 cc, season: 2002 - 2008, race: 65, podiums: 7, pole: 0.\nRow 3: class: motogp, season: 2009, race: 7, podiums: 0, pole: 0.\nRow 4: class: moto2, season: 2010 -, race: 62, podiums: 4, pole: 0.\nRow 5: class: total, season: 2002 - present, race: 135, podiums: 11, pole: 0.\n\nI need to find the row that corresponds to the Moto2 class and check the value in the \"pole\" column. \n\nLooking at Row 4, which is for the moto2 class, the pole count is listed as 0. That means there were zero poles (or pole positions) achieved by the Moto2 class according to this table.\n\nThe claim states that there are 4 poles, but according to the data, it's 0. Therefore, the claim doesn't match the information provided in the table.\n\nTo confirm, I'll also check if any other rows might relate to the Moto2 class or affect this count. The \"total\" row at the bottom shows a pole count of 0 as well, which suggests that across all classes combined, there were no poles. So, it's consistent with the Moto2 class having zero.\n\nTherefore, since the claim says there are 4 poles for Moto2 and the table shows 0, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"4 pole have a moto2 class\" is FALSE because the Moto2 class has 0 pole positions according to the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pole\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
