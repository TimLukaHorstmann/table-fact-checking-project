    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states:\n\n\"on june 9 , the record be 28 - 29 with a loss of mulholland (5 - 6) and an opponent of the yankee\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim to check against the table.\n\n1. **Date**: The date mentioned is June 9. Looking at the table, each row has a 'date' column. Scanning through, I find that Row 7 corresponds to June 9.\n\n2. **Record**: The claim mentions the record being 28-29 on that date. Checking Row 7, the 'record' is listed as 28 - 29. This matches.\n\n3. **Loss Information**: The loss is attributed to \"mulholland (5 - 6)\". In the table, the 'loss' column for Row 7 shows \"mulholland (5 - 6)\", which aligns with the claim.\n\n4. **Opponent**: The opponent is stated as \"the yankee\". The table's 'opponent' column in Row 7 lists \"yankee\" (assuming that's a typo and should be \"Yankees\"). However, since it's spelled as \"yankee\" in both places, it seems consistent.\n\nEach part of the claim corresponds correctly with the data in Row 7. There are no discrepancies found in any of these points.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"date\"}, {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"record\"}, {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"loss\"}, {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"opponent\"}]}",
