The claim states: \"the result when dundee be the opponent be 3 - 4\". \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find where the opponent is Dundee. Scanning through rows 1 to 6, I see that Row 4 has the opponent as Dundee. Now, checking the result for this row: it's listed as 3-1, not 3-4. The scorers are mckinnon, jackson, and ferguson.\n\nThe claim mentions a result of 3-4 against Dundee, but according to Row 4, the actual result was a win with 3 goals scored by our team and only 1 from Dundee. There's no row where Dundee as an opponent resulted in a 3-4 outcome. \n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"on march 13 1990 be play against dundee and result in 3 - 1.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll check each part of the claim against the table's rows to see if all conditions are met.\n\nLooking at the dates in each row:\n- Row 1: 26 January 1990\n- Row 2: 29 January 1990\n- Row 3: 23 February 1990\n- Row 4: 13 March 1990\n- Row 5: 6 April 1991\n- Row 6: 18 May 1991\n\nThe claim mentions \"march 13 1990,\" which corresponds to Row 4's date of 13 March 1990. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, the opponent is mentioned as \"dundee.\" Looking at Row 4, the opponent is indeed Dundee. That matches the claim.\n\nNow, checking the result: The claim says \"result in 3 - 1.\" In Row 4, the result column shows \"3 - 1,\" which aligns exactly with what's stated.\n\nAdditionally, the venue isn't specified in the claim, so I don't need to verify that. Similarly, attendance and scorers aren't part of the claim, so they're irrelevant here.\n\nAll parts of the claim (date, opponent, result) are accurately reflected in Row 4 of the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
