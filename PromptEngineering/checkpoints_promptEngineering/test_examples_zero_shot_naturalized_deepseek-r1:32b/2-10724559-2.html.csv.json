That's our target row.\n\nNow, let's check the details mentioned in the claim. The first part is about \"apps\" which stands for appearances. In Row 4, under the column \"apps\", the value is 258. So that matches exactly with what's claimed.\n\nNext, the claim mentions an \"all-time rank of 53\". Looking at Row 4 again, the column \"all - time rank\" has a value of 53. That also matches perfectly.\n\nSo both pieces of information in the claim are accurate according to the table.

I need to determine whether the claim \"Diego Milito debut in 2008 and have 86 goal\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n1. Diego Milito's debut year was 2008.\n2. He has scored 86 goals.\n\nNext, I need to look at the table provided to verify these two pieces of information.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n- Row 8: Rank 8, All-time rank 97, Name Diego Milito, Debut year 2008, Current club Inter, Goals 86, Apps 145.\n- Row 9: Also has a rank of 8 and same all-time rank, but the name is Sergio Pellissier.\n\nSo for Diego Milito:\n- His debut year is listed as 2008. That matches the first part of the claim.\n- He has 86 goals, which also matches the second part of the claim.\n\nBoth pieces of information from the claim are correctly represented in Row 8 of the table. There's no discrepancy here.\n\nTherefore, since both parts of the claim are accurate according to the table, the answer should be TRUE. The relevant cells are the 'debut year' and 'goals' columns for Diego Milito in row 8.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Claim Components:**\n   - Claim states that Diego Milito debuted in 2008.\n   - He has scored 86 goals.\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Data in Table:**\n   - Scanning through the rows, Row 8 contains information about Diego Milito.\n   \n3. **Verify Each Part of the Claim:**\n   - **Debut Year:** The 'debut year' column in Row 8 shows 2008, which matches the claim.\n   - **Goals Scored:** The 'goals' column in Row 8 indicates 86 goals, aligning with the claim.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   Both pieces of information from the claim are accurately reflected in Row 8 of the table. Hence, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"debut year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"Diego Milito, who scored 86 goals, have a debut year of 2008.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find the entry for Diego Milito. Scanning the names, I see that in row 8 and row 9, both players have the same all-time rank (97) but different names: Diego Milito is in row 8.\n\nLooking at row 8, I check the columns relevant to the claim. The name is correct\u2014Diego Milito. Next, I'll verify his goals. In the 'goals' column, it shows 86, which matches the claim's 86 goals. Then, checking the 'debut year' for Diego Milito in row 8, it says 2008. That also aligns with what the claim states.\n\nSo both pieces of information\u2014the number of goals and the debut year\u2014are accurate according to the table.

The claim states: \"the person who have an all-time rank of 53, have 258 apps.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the table to find where the 'all-time rank' column matches 53. Scanning down, Row 4 shows that Luca Toni has an all-time rank of 53. Now, checking the 'apps' column for this row, it says 258. \n\nThat means the claim is correct because Luca Toni, who has an all-time rank of 53, indeed has 258 applications (apps).

    "claim": "0 goal occur with diego milito in a debut year before 2008",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"0 goal occur with diego milito in a debut year before 2008\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that Diego Milito scored zero goals in a season where his debut year was before 2008. So I need to check two things for Diego Milito: his debut year and the number of goals he has scored.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through each row until I find Diego Milito's name. Scanning down, Row 8 is Dieo Milito. The details are: rank 8, all-time rank 97, name Diego Milito, debut year 2008, current club Inter, goals 86, apps 145.\n\nSo, his debut year is 2008, and he has scored 86 goals. Now, the claim says that in a debut year before 2008, Diego Milito had zero goals. But according to the table, his debut was exactly in 2008, not before.\n\nWait, does the claim specify \"debut year before 2008\"? So if his debut was in 2008, any goals he scored after that would be in years starting from 2008 onwards. The claim is about whether there were zero goals in a season where his debut was before 2008. Since his debut was in 2008 itself, does that mean prior to 2008, he hadn't debuted yet? Therefore, any goals would start from 2008 onwards.\n\nBut the claim is phrased as \"0 goal occur with diego milito in a debut year before 2008\". So it's saying that in years where his debut was before 2008, he had zero goals. Since his debut was in 2008, there are no seasons where his debut was before 2008. Therefore, the number of goals in such seasons would be zero because those seasons didn't exist for him.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the claim is TRUE. There are no goals from Diego Milito in a debut year before 2008 because he debuted in 2008.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is about whether Diego Milito scored any goals in seasons where his debut occurred before 2008. The table shows that his debut was in 2008, so there are no prior years to consider. Hence, the number of goals is zero.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"debut year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the claim \"there be 96 goal achieve when chievo be the club which debut after 1999\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems a bit awkwardly phrased, but I think it's trying to say that there are 96 goals scored by players who play for Chievo and made their debut after the year 1999.\n\nSo, breaking down the claim into parts:\n\n1. Club: Chievo\n2. Debut year: After 1999 (so 2000 or later)\n3. Goals achieved: 96\n\nNow, I'll check each row in the table to see if any player meets these conditions.\n\nLooking through the rows, I find that Row 9 has Chievo as the current club. Let's examine this row:\n\n- Name: Sergio Pellissier\n- Current Club: Chievo\n- Debut Year: 2002 (which is after 1999)\n- Goals: 86\n\nThe goals here are 86, which doesn't match the claim of 96. So, this player only has 86 goals.\n\nNext, I'll check if there's any other row where the current club is Chievo. From a quick glance, it seems Row 9 is the only one with Chievo as the club. \n\nI should also consider if \"chievo be the club which debut after 1999\" refers to the player's debut year being after 1999 while playing for Chievo. But in this case, Sergio Pellissier's debut was in 2002 when he was with another club before moving to Chievo, I suppose. However, regardless of that, his total goals are still only 86.\n\nAre there any other players from Chievo? Let me double-check the table:\n\n- Row 1: Roma\n- Row 2: Udinese\n- Row 3: Genoa\n- Row 4: Verona\n- Row 5: Parma\n- Row 6: Milan\n- Row 7: Juventus\n- Row 8: Inter\n- Row 9: Chievo\n- Row 10: Parm\n\nNo other rows have Chievo as the current club. So, only Sergio Pellissier from Chievo is in the table.\n\nSince his goals are 86 and not 96, the claim isn't supported by the data. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"current club\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"debut year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"mirko vu\u010dini\u0107 didn't score any goal in a debut year later than 2008\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify where Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107's information is in the table. Looking through each row:\n\nRow 6 and Row 7 both have rank 6 and all-time rank 81. Row 6 is Giampaolo Pazzini, and Row 7 is Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107. So, his details are in Row 7.\n\nNow, looking at the claim: it says he didn't score any goal in a debut year later than 2008. Wait, that phrasing seems a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. The claim is about whether he scored goals in a debut year after 2008. But actually, when a player debuts, their debut year is the first year they played. So if his debut year was 2008 or earlier, then any goals he scored would be from that year onward.\n\nWait, no. The claim says \"didn't score any goal in a debut year later than 2008.\" That might mean that there's no data showing he scored in a debut year after 2008. But actually, each player has only one debut year\u2014the first year they played professionally. So if his debut was before or in 2008, then any goals he scored in later years would still be valid.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the relevant data for Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107:\n\n- Debut Year: 2000\n- Goals: 95\n\nSo his debut was in 2000. The claim is about whether he didn't score any goals in a debut year later than 2008. Since his debut year is 2000, which is earlier than 2008, the question is whether he scored any goals after 2008.\n\nWait, but the claim specifically mentions \"in a debut year.\" That's confusing because each player has only one debut year\u2014their first season. So if someone's debut year was in 2000, there are no later debut years for them. Therefore, the claim is a bit nonsensical because he can't have a debut year after 2008 since he already debuted in 2000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is trying to say that he didn't score any goals in seasons where his debut was after 2008. But since his debut was in 2000, all subsequent years are not his debut year. Therefore, it's impossible for him to have scored goals in a debut year after 2008 because he doesn't have any.\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE because there are no seasons where his debut year would be later than 2008\u2014his only debut was in 2000.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107 didn't score any goals in a debut year after 2008. Since his debut was in 2000, there are no years beyond 2008 where he could have debuted. Thus, the statement is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"debut year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
