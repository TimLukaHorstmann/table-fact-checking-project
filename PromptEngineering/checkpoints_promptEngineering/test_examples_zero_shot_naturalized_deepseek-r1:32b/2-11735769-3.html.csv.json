    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"icarly be nominate for more award than the show win\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim means. The claim states that the show \"iCarly\" was nominated for more awards than it actually won. So, I need to count how many times \"iCarly\" was nominated and compare that to the number of awards it won.\n\nLooking at the table, there are seven rows of data, each representing a different award event from 2009 to 2013. The relevant columns here are 'award', 'category', 'work' (which is \"icarly\" in most cases), and 'result'.\n\nI'll go through each row and check the result column to see if it's a nomination or a win, specifically for \"iCarly\".\n\nRow 1: Year 2009, award is Teen Choice Awards, category is Choice TV Actor - Comedy, work is iCarly, result is Nominated. So that's one nomination.\n\nRow 2: 2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards, Big Kid Award for iCarly, result is Nominated. Another nomination.\n\nRow 3: Same year and award as row 2, but category is Lol Award (shared with ensemble), work is iCarly, result is Won. So that's one win.\n\nRow 4: 2011 UK Kids' Choice Awards, Nick UK's Funniest Person, iCarly, result is Won. Another win.\n\nRow 5: 2011 Meus Pr\u00e3\u00aamios Nick Brazil, Funniest Character, iCarly, result is Nominated. So another nomination.\n\nRow 6: 2012 Kids' Choice Awards, Favorite TV Sidekick, iCarly, result is Nominated. That's the fourth nomination.\n\nRow 7: 2013 Daytime Emmy Awards, category is Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program, work is Tuff Puppy (not iCarly), so this row can be ignored as it's for a different show.\n\nNow, let's tally up the nominations and wins specifically for iCarly:\n\nNominations: Rows 1, 2, 5, 6 \u2192 that's four nominations.\nWins: Rows 3, 4 \u2192 that's two wins.\n\nSo, the claim is checking if the number of nominations (4) is more than the number of wins (2). Since 4 > 2, this makes the claim TRUE.\n\nAdditionally, I'll note which cells are relevant. The 'result' column for each row where work is iCarly is important. So rows 1-6 are relevant because they involve iCarly, except row 7 since it's about Tuff Puppy.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are all the rows from 0 to 5 (since indexing starts at 0), specifically looking at the 'result' column in each of these.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"tuff be the only other show nominate aside from icarly\". Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's saying that \"Tuff\" is the only other show besides \"iCarly\" that has been nominated for any award. So, in other words, apart from all the nominations under \"iCarly,\" there should be exactly one more nomination for another show, which is \"Tuff.\"\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, each row represents a different award nomination or win. Let's go through each row to check the 'work' column because that indicates which show was nominated.\n\nRow 1: Work is \"icarly\" \u2013 so this is about iCarly.\nRow 2: Also \"icarly.\"\nRow 3: Again, \"icarly.\"\nRow 4: Still \"icarly.\"\nRow 5: Nominated for \"iCarly\" again in Brazil.\nRow 6: Another nomination for \"iCarly\" as a favorite TV sidekick.\nRow 7: Here's where it changes. The work is \"tuff puppy.\" So this row is about \"Tuff Puppy,\" and it was nominated in the category of outstanding performer in an animated program at the Daytime Emmys.\n\nSo, from rows 1 to 6, all works are \"icarly,\" except for row 7, which is \"tuff puppy.\"\n\nNow, let's count how many other shows have been nominated besides \"iCarly.\" From the table, only row 7 mentions a different show, \"Tuff Puppy.\" All others are iCarly. So, there is indeed another show, Tuff Puppy, that was nominated.\n\nBut wait, does any other row mention a different show? Let me double-check all rows:\n\n- Rows 1: icarly\n- Row 2: icarly\n- Row 3: icarly\n- Row 4: icarly\n- Row 5: icarly\n- Row 6: icarly\n- Row 7: tuff puppy\n\nSo, only row 7 has a different show. Therefore, Tuff Puppy is the only other show besides iCarly that was nominated.\n\nThe claim says \"tuff be the only other show nominate aside from icarly.\" So according to the table, yes, Tuff Puppy is the sole other nomination outside of iCarly.\n\nThus, the claim should be TRUE. The relevant cells are all the 'work' columns because they indicate which shows were nominated. Specifically, rows 1-6 and row 7 under the 'work' column show that only Tuff Puppy is the other nominee besides iCarly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_1\": 1, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_2\": 2, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_3\": 3, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_4\": 4, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_5\": 5, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_6\": 6, \"column_name\": \"work\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim about Jerry Trainor winning two awards is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim carefully: \"Jerry Traino win a total of 2 award, 1 for lol award (shared with ensemble) and 1 for nick uk 's funniest person.\" So, according to this, he won two awards in total\u2014one was the \"lol award\" shared with an ensemble, and another was \"nick uk's funniest person.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find entries where the result is \"won\" because the claim is about winning awards. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Nominated for Choice TV Actor: Comedy in 2009. Not a win.\n\nRow 2: Nominated for Big Kid Award in 2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards. Also not a win.\n\nRow 3: Won the \"lol award\" shared with ensemble in 2010. That's one win as per the claim.\n\nRow 4: Won \"nick uk's funniest person\" in 2011. That's another win, so that's two wins total according to the table.\n\nRows 5-7 show nominations or different categories where he didn't win. \n\nSo, based on this, Jerry Trainor won exactly two awards: one for \"lol award\" and one for \"nick uk's funniest person.\" Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant. For each award mentioned, I should look at the row index and the column names that support this conclusion.\n\nFor the \"lol award (shared with ensemble)\" win:\n- The row index is 2.\n- The columns involved here are \"category\" where it's \"lol award (shared with ensemble)\" and \"result\" which shows \"won.\"\n\nFor the \"nick uk's funniest person\" win:\n- The row index is 3.\n- Again, we look at \"category\" being that specific award and \"result\" indicating a win.\n\nSo the relevant cells are in rows 2 and 3 for their respective categories and results. \n\nPutting this all together, the claim checks out with the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about Jerry Traino's nominations and wins is true or false based on the table provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"Jerry Traino be nominated for 2 award in 2010 and 2 award in 2011 win only 1 in each year.\" It seems like there might be a typo, maybe it should say \"nominated\" instead of \"be nominate,\" but I'll assume that's the intended meaning.\n\nThe claim states two main points:\n1. In 2010, Jerry was nominated for 2 awards and won only 1.\n2. In 2011, he was also nominated for 2 awards and won only 1 in each year.\n\nI need to check these against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- **2009**: Row 1 shows a nomination for Teen Choice Awards.\n- **2010**: Rows 2 and 3. Both are from the Australian Kids' Choice Awards. In row 2, he was nominated in the Big Kid Award category and result is \"nominated.\" In row 3, it's the LOL Award (shared with ensemble) and the result is \"won.\" So, for 2010, that's one nomination and one win.\n- **2011**: Rows 4 and 5. Row 4 is from UK Kids' Choice Awards, category Nick UK's funniest person, result won. Row 5 is Meus Pr\u00eamios Nick Brazil, category Funniest Character, result nominated. So, in 2011, that's one win and one nomination.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says he was nominated for 2 awards each year (2010 and 2011) and won only 1 in each year. But looking at the table:\n\n- In 2010: He had two entries, both from Australian Kids' Choice. Row 2 is a nomination, row 3 is a win. So that's one nomination and one win.\n- In 2011: Two entries again. Row 4 is a win, row 5 is a nomination.\n\nSo each year (2010 and 2011), he had two awards each\u2014 one where he was nominated and one where he won. But according to the table, in both years, he only won once each. So that part of the claim seems correct: in each year, he was nominated for two awards and won one.\n\nWait, but looking again, in 2010, there are two separate categories within the same award event (Australian Kids' Choice). The first nomination is for Big Kid Award, and the second is a win for LOL Award. Similarly, in 2011, he has a win in UK's funniest person and a nomination in Brazil's Meus Pr\u00eamios Nick.\n\nSo each year, there are two awards (different categories) with one win and one nomination each.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"nominated for 2 award in 2010\"\u2014that's correct because he was nominated once and won once. So in total, that's two awards related to him in 2010: one nomination and one win. Similarly, in 2011, same situation.\n\nSo the claim is accurate: in both 2010 and 2011, Jerry Traino was involved in two awards each year\u2014 one where he was nominated and another where he won. So the claim that he was nominated for two awards each year (each time including a nomination and a win) holds.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if \"nominated for 2 awards\" means exactly two nominations or two mentions (nomination plus win). If the claim is saying he was nominated in both cases, then it's incorrect because one of them he won. So perhaps the wording is off.\n\nThe claim says: \"Jerry Traino be nominate for 2 award in 2010 and 2 award in 2011 win only 1 in each year.\" It seems to suggest that in each of those years, he was nominated twice (two nominations) but won once. However, according to the table:\n\n- In 2010: He has two entries\u2014one as a nomination and one as a win.\n- In 2011: Similarly, one win and one nomination.\n\nSo if \"nominated for 2 awards\" means he was nominated in both cases, but one of them resulted in a win, then that's not accurate because being nominated doesn't necessarily mean you didn't win. So the claim might be misleading. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is saying he was nominated twice and won once each year.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nThe claim: \"Jerry Traino be nominate for 2 award in 2010 and 2 award in 2011 win only 1 in each year.\"\n\nThis can be interpreted as:\n- In 2010: Nominated for two awards, won one.\n- In 2011: Nominated for two awards, won one.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nIn 2010:\n- Award 1: Australian Kids' Choice - Big Kid Award: nominated\n- Award 2: Australian Kids' Choice - LOL Award: won\n\nSo he was nominated once and won once. So total nominations in 2010: 1, wins:1.\n\nSimilarly, in 2011:\n- UK Kids' Choice Awards: won\n- Meus Pr\u00eamios Nick Brazil: nominated\n\nAgain, one nomination and one win each year.\n\nSo the claim says he was nominated for two awards each year. But according to the table, each year he had only one nomination (and one win). Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states two nominations each year when actually there was only one nomination per year.\n\nWait, but in 2010, there are two separate categories within the same award event\u2014does that count as two awards? So perhaps each category is considered an individual award. So in 2010, he participated in two different categories under the Australian Kids' Choice Awards: one nomination and one win.\n\nSimilarly, in 2011, two different categories: one win and one nomination.\n\nSo if each category counts as a separate award, then yes, he was nominated for two awards in 2010 (but only one resulted in a nomination, the other in a win). Similarly, in 2011, two awards with one nomination and one win.\n\nBut wait, being nominated implies that you didn't win. If you won an award, you were not \"nominated\" for it\u2014you were a winner. So if the claim is saying he was nominated for two awards each year (implying both times he was just nominated and didn't win), but according to the table, in 2010 and 2011, he won one award each year.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it suggests that in each of those years, he was only nominated twice without winning anything. But in reality, he did win once each year, which would mean he wasn't just \"nominated\" for both; one of them resulted in a win.\n\nHence, the correct interpretation would be that the claim is incorrect because it implies two nominations (without wins) when actually there was a mix of a nomination and a win each year.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Jerry Traino was nominated for two awards in 2010 and two awards in 2011, winning only one in each year. However, upon examining the table:\n\n- In **2010**, Jerry was involved in two separate categories under the Australian Kids' Choice Awards:\n  - **Nominated** for the Big Kid Award.\n  - **Won** the LOL Award.\n\n- In **2011**, he was again involved in two categories:\n  - **Won** at the UK Kids' Choice Awards.\n  - **Nominated** at Meus Pr\u00eamios Nick Brazil.\n\nThus, each year Jerry had one nomination and one win. The claim incorrectly suggests that he was nominated for two awards without considering the wins. Therefore:\n\n- In 2010: He was **nominated once** (Big Kid Award) and **won once** (LOL Award).\n- In 2011: He was **nominated once** (Meus Pr\u00eamios Nick Brazil) and **won once** (UK Kids' Choice Awards).\n\nThe claim is inaccurate because it implies two nominations without acknowledging the wins.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is incorrect. Jerry Traino was nominated for one award and won another each year in 2010 and 2011, not twice nominated with a single win as stated.",

The claim states: \"In 2010 Jerry Traino was nominated for the 2010 Australian Kids' Choice Award in two different categories.\"\n\nFirst, let me look at the table rows where the year is 2010. There are two such rows: Row 2 and Row 3.\n\nRow 2 shows that in 2010, there was a nomination for the \"Big Kid Award\" from the Australian Kids' Choice Awards, with the work being iCarly. The result was a nomination.\n\nRow 3 also mentions 2010, same award event, but this time it's the \"LOL Award (shared with ensemble)\" category, again for iCarly. However, in this case, the result was a win.\n\nThe claim says Jerry Traino was nominated in two different categories. From Row 2 and Row 3, I can see that there are indeed two entries for 2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards: one in \"Big Kid Award\" and another in \"LOL Award\". However, looking at the results, while he was nominated in the first category (as per Row 2), in the second category, it shows a win. So the claim might be mixing up whether both were nominations or if one resulted in a win.\n\nBut wait, the claim specifically mentions being nominated, not necessarily winning. So I need to check if in both categories he was at least nominated. In Row 3, the result is \"won,\" which implies that it's an award he received, so perhaps the nomination occurred as well since you can't win without being nominated first.\n\nBut looking back, the table might just list whether they were nominated or won. So for Row 2: category was a nomination, and in Row 3: it resulted in a win. Therefore, he was at least nominated in both categories because winning implies he was nominated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table doesn't explicitly state if both were nominations; maybe only one was a nomination, but that's not clear. However, given that both are from 2010 and same award event, it's logical to infer that being in two different categories for the same award would involve two nominations.\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim says \"nominated for... in two different categories.\" So if one was a nomination (Row 2) and another resulted in a win (Row 3), does that count as both being nominated? The table doesn't explicitly state whether he was nominated in the LOL Award category or only won. But usually, to win, you have to be nominated first.\n\nTherefore, it's reasonable to conclude that he was indeed nominated in both categories, and one of them resulted in a win. So the claim holds: he was nominated in two different categories at the 2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Jerry Traino was involved in two separate entries for the 2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards. In Row 2, he was nominated in the \"Big Kid Award\" category and in Row 3, he won the \"LOL Award (shared with ensemble)\" category. Since winning typically follows a nomination, it implies that he was also nominated for the second category.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is TRUE as Jerry Traino was nominated in two different categories at the 2010 awards.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"category\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine if the claim \"icarly be nominate for 10 time as many award as the show win\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the table structure. Each row represents an award nomination or win for the show \"iCarly.\" There are columns for year, award name, category, work (which is always iCarly except for one entry), and result which can be either nominated or won.\n\nThe claim says that \"icarly be nominate for 10 times as many awards as the show win.\" So I need to count how many nominations and wins there are. \n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Nominated\nRow 2: Nominated\nRow 3: Won\nRow 4: Won\nRow 5: Nominated\nRow 6: Nominated\nRow 7: This is about \"Tuff Puppy,\" not iCarly, so I can ignore this row.\n\nNow, counting the nominations for iCarly:\nRows 1,2,5,6 are nominated. That's 4 nominations.\n\nWins for iCarly:\nRows 3 and 4 are wins. So that's 2 wins.\n\nThe claim says it was nominated 10 times as many awards as it won.

That doesn't add up at all.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I misinterpreted the claim. Perhaps it's saying the number of nominations is ten times the number of wins? So nominations = 10 * wins.\n\nIn this case, nominations would need to be 20 for the claim to hold true, but we only have 4.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Jerry Traino's nominations and wins is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"jerry traino be nominate for 2 award in 2010 and 2 award in 2011 win both in each year.\" Hmm, I notice that there are some grammatical errors here, but I think the intended meaning is that Jerry Traino was nominated for two awards in 2010 and two awards in 2011, winning both in each of those years.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, which lists various awards, categories, works, results, etc. But wait a second\u2014I don't see any mention of \"Jerry Traino\" in the table. The work listed is always \"icarly,\" but there's no indication of who was nominated or won these awards. So, the table doesn't provide information about individuals; it just mentions the award, category, and result.\n\nSince the claim is specifically about Jerry Traino, but the table doesn't include any data related to him, I can't verify whether he was nominated or won anything in 2010 or 2011. The table only shows that \"icarly\" received nominations and wins across different years and awards.\n\nTherefore, without any information about Jerry Traino in the table, I have no basis to confirm his nominations or victories. This means the claim cannot be supported by the given data.\n</think>\n\nThe table doesn't mention Jerry Traino, so we can't verify the claims about him.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "claim": "tuff be the only show nominate",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"tuff be the only show nominate\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It seems like it's saying that \"Tuff\" was the only show that received a nomination. So, I'm looking for any mentions of shows being nominated and checking if \"Tuff\" is the sole nominee.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has entries for year, award, category, work, and result. The key columns here are \"work\" which indicates the show or role, and \"result\" which tells us if it was nominated or won.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Work is \"icarly\", result is \"nominated\".\n2. **Row 2**: Work is \"icarly\", result is \"nominated\".\n3. **Row 3**: Work is \"icarly\", result is \"won\".\n4. **Row 4**: Work is \"icarly\", result is \"won\".\n5. **Row 5**: Work is \"icarly\", result is \"nominated\".\n6. **Row 6**: Work is \"icarly\", result is \"nominated\".\n7. **Row 7**: Work is \"tuff puppy\", result is \"nominated\".\n\nFrom this, I can see that multiple entries for \"icarly\" have the result as nominated or won. The only entry where a different work is mentioned is in Row 7, which is \"tuff puppy\". So, \"Tuff Puppy\" was nominated once, but \"icarly\" had several nominations and wins.\n\nThe claim says that \"Tuff\" (presumably referring to \"Tuff Puppy\") was the only show nominated. However, since \"icarly\" also received multiple nominations, this isn't accurate.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are all instances where the result is 'nominated' or 'won'. This includes Rows 1-6 for \"icarly\" and Row 7 for \"tuff puppy\". The claim is FALSE because \"icarly\" was nominated more than once.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states that Jerry Trainor won a total of 4 awards: 2 for the \"lol award (shared with ensemble)\" and 2 for \"nick uk's funniest person\". \n\nFirst, I'll go through each row of the table to see which ones are relevant. \n\nLooking at Row 3: It mentions the 2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards with the category \"lol award (shared with ensemble)\" where the result was a win. That's one award under that category.\n\nRow 4 is about the 2011 UK Kids' Choice Awards, specifically the \"nick uk's funniest person\" category, and it says the result was a win. So that's one win in this category.\n\nNext, I check if there are any other rows where either of these categories appear again. Row 3 is the only mention of the lol award, so that's just one win. Similarly, Row 4 is the sole instance of \"nick uk's funniest person\", giving another single win. \n\nSo far, I've found two wins in total: one for each category. The claim says Jerry won four awards with two in each category, which doesn't match the table. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Jerry Trainor only won one \"lol award (shared with ensemble)\" and one \"nick uk's funniest person\", totaling two wins instead of four.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"category\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"In 2008 Jerry Traino was nominated for the 2008 Australian Kids' Choice Award in two different categories.\"\n\nFirst, I need to check if there are any entries in the table from 2008.

Checking the awards:\n\n- Rows 2 and 3 mention \"2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards,\" but the year is 2010, not 2008.\n- No other rows have an award from 2008.\n\nAdditionally, the claim states that he was nominated in two different categories. However, since there are no entries for 2008 at all, and specifically none for Jerry Traino or any awards from that year, this can't be true.\n\nMoreover, looking at each cell to see if anything relates to 2008 or the Australian Kids' Choice Awards in 2008:\n\n- All rows are either 2009, 2010, 2011, etc., so no relevant cells here.\n- The only Australian awards are in row 2 and 3 for 2010.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no data supporting any nominations in 2008, let alone two categories.
