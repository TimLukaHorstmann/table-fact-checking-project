    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the youngest winner be 8 years older than the youngest nominee.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and identify which rows are relevant for this claim. The claim mentions two things: the youngest winner and the youngest nominee. So, I should find the rows that have information about these superlatives.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 1 talks about the most awards, so not directly relevant.\n- Row 2 is about the most nominations; again, not exactly what we need.\n- Rows 3 and 4 are about the oldest winners and nominees. Not needed here since the claim is about the youngest.\n- Row 5: superlative is \"youngest winner.\" So this row is important. The director is Norman Taurog, record set at 32 years old in 1930/31. Notes say Skippy. So the age here is 32.\n  \n- Row 6: superlative is \"youngest nominee.\" Director is John Singleton, record set at 24 years old in 1991. Notes mention Boyz n the Hood. So his age was 24.\n\nNow, the claim says that the youngest winner is 8 years older than the youngest nominee. Let's calculate the difference between their ages: Youngest winner is 32, youngest nominee is 24. Subtracting 24 from 32 gives us 8 years. So yes, 32 minus 24 equals exactly 8 years. That means the claim is correct.\n\nSo, I need to note which cells were relevant for this determination. For the youngest winner, that's Row 5 in the \"record set\" column where it says 32 years old. And for the youngest nominee, that's Row 6 in the same \"record set\" column showing 24 years old.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because 32 minus 24 equals 8.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the youngest winner was 8 years older than the youngest nominee. Checking the table:\n\n- Youngest winner: Norman Taurog at 32 years old (Row 5).\n- Youngest nominee: John Singleton at 24 years old (Row 6).\n\nDifference is 8 years, so the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"record set\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"record set\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"William Wyler received more than twice the amount of nominations as John Ford\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me look at each row in the table to find information about William Wyler and John Ford.\n\nLooking at Row 2: Superlative is \"most nominations\", Director is William Wyler. The record set here is 12 nominations. So, William Wyler received 12 nominations.\n\nNext, checking for John Ford. I see Row 1 has the director as John Ford. His record is about awards, not nominations. It says he received 4 awards from 5 nominations. Wait, so does that mean John Ford had 5 nominations? The notes say \"awards resulted from 5 nominations,\" which implies he was nominated 5 times.\n\nNow, to verify the claim: William Wyler's nominations (12) compared to twice John Ford's nominations. Twice 5 is 10. So, 12 > 10, meaning William Wyler indeed received more than twice as many nominations as John Ford.\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells are:\n- Row 2 for William Wyler's nominations.\n- Row 1 for John Ford's nominations (from notes).\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"notes\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record set\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that both the oldest winner and the oldest nominee are in their seventies. So I should check two things: who is the oldest winner, how old were they, and then do the same for the oldest nominee.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has different information about directors and records related to awards or nominations. The superlative column tells us what record each director holds. \n\nStarting with the oldest winner: I scan through the rows looking for \"oldest winner\". That's in Row 3. According to that row, Clint Eastwood is the oldest winner at 74 years old when he won in 2004 for \"Million Dollar Baby.\" So 74 falls into the seventies.\n\nNext, I need to find the oldest nominee. Scanning through again, I see Row 4 mentions John Huston as the oldest nominee, aged 79 years old in 1985 for \"Prizzi's Honor.\" 79 is also in the seventies since it's between 70 and 79 inclusive.\n\nSo both the oldest winner (74) and the oldest nominee (79) are indeed in their seventies. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nTo make sure I didn't miss anything, I'll double-check the relevant cells:\n\n- For the oldest winner: Row 3 has superlative as \"oldest winner,\" director Clint Eastwood, record set at 74 years old.\n- For the oldest nominee: Row 4 shows superlative as \"oldest nominee,\" director John Huston, with a record of 79 years old.\n\nBoth these entries are in their respective seventies. No other rows mention older ages or conflicting information. So I'm confident that the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks both the oldest winner and the oldest nominee's ages against the seventies. Both Clint Eastwood (74) and John Huston (79) fit within this range.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"superlative\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record set\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"superlative\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"record set\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. The table has six rows, each representing a different record with columns like superlative, director, record set, year, and notes.\n\nThe claim mentions that three directors have the first name \"john.\" So I need to check each row's director column to see how many start with John.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Director is John Ford. That counts as one.\nRow 2: William Wyler\u2014doesn't start with John.\nRow 3: Clint Eastwood\u2014nope.\nRow 4: John Huston\u2014that's two.\nRow 5: Norman Taurog\u2014not John.\nRow 6: John Singleton\u2014that makes three.\n\nSo, rows 1, 4, and 6 have directors named John. That adds up to three directors with the first name John. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to list the relevant cells for each of these entries.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It states two main points:\n1. The oldest winner (from the table) set their record.\n2. This happened in the \"most recent year list.\" I think that means it occurred in the most recent year listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows, each with different superlatives. The relevant superlative here is \"oldest winner,\" which is row 3: Clint Eastwood, who was 74 years old when he won in 2004 for \"Million Dollar Baby.\"\n\nNow, I need to check what the \"most recent year\" in the table is. Let's look at all the years listed:\n- Row 1: 1952\n- Row 2: 1965\n- Row 3: 2004\n- Row 4: 1985\n- Row 5: 1930/31\n- Row 6: 1991\n\nThe most recent year among these is 2004, which corresponds to row 3.

So the youngest winner is 32 years old.\n\nNext, checking Row 6: The superlative here is \"youngest nominee\", directed by John Singleton, who was 24 years old in 1991. Therefore, the youngest nominee is 24 years old.\n\nNow, I need to compare these two ages. The claim states that the youngest winner is more than 8 years older than the youngest nominee. Let's calculate the age difference: 32 (winner) - 24 (nominee) = 8 years. \n\nThe claim says \"more than 8 years,\" but the actual difference is exactly 8 years.

The claim is: \"William Wyler received less than 2 times the amount of nominations as John Ford.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should find the relevant information about William Wyler and John Ford from the table. Looking at the table rows:\n\n- Row 1 talks about John Ford with superlative \"most awards,\" but that's not directly relevant to nominations.\n- Row 2 is about William Wyler with \"most nominations.\" So this seems important because the claim mentions nominations for both directors.\n\nWait, does the table have information about the number of nominations each received? Let me check:\n\nRow 1: John Ford has 4 awards from 5 nominations (since notes say awards resulted from 5 nominations). So John Ford was nominated 5 times.\nRow 2: William Wyler set a record with 12 nominations, which resulted in 3 awards.\n\nSo, William Wyler had 12 nominations. The claim says that William received less than 2 times the amount of nominations as John Ford. Let's compute:\n\nJohn Ford's nominations = 5\nWilliam Wyler's nominations = 12\n\nNow, 2 times John Ford's nominations would be 2 * 5 = 10.\n\nThe question is: Is 12 (Wyler's) less than 10? No, because 12 is greater than 10. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait a second, maybe I misread something. Let me double-check:\n\n- John Ford has 5 nominations leading to 4 awards.\n- William Wyler has 12 nominations leading to 3 awards.\n\nSo the numbers are correct. The calculation: 2 * John's nominations = 10. William's is 12, which is more than 10, so he didn't receive less than two times. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells would be:\n\n- For William Wyler (Row 2), the \"record set\" column mentions 12 nominations.\n- For John Ford (Row 1), the \"notes\" column mentions 5 nominations.\n\nSo those are the two cells needed to verify the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"record set\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"notes\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
