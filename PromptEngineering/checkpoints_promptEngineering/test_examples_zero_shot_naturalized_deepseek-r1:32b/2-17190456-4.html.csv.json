So the claim says \"St. Louis 3, Pittsburgh 2\", which matches.\n\nNext, checking the points accumulated. The 'points' column for row 12 shows 20.

I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nThe claim is: \"18 points were accumulated on December 21 when Pittsburgh hosted Minnesota in front of a crowd of 5307.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the components that need verification:\n1. **Date**: The event should be on December 21.\n2. **Home Team**: Pittsburgh should be the home team.\n3. **Visitor Team**: Minnesota should be the visiting team.\n4. **Points Accumulated**: The points for that game should be 18.\n5. **Attendance**: There should be 5307 attendees.\n\nNow, I'll look through each row of the table to find the relevant information.\n\nStarting with Row 9:\n- Date: December 21\n- Visitor: Minnesota\n- Home: Pittsburgh\n- Attendance: 5307\n- Points: 18\n\nThis matches all the criteria mentioned in the claim. The date is correct, the home team is Pittsburgh, the visitor is Minnesota, the attendance is exactly 5307, and the points accumulated are 18.\n\nI should also check if there's any other row that might fit these details to ensure there isn't a mistake or duplication.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the point be 18 when the home team be boston\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break down the steps.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that whenever Boston is the home team, the points should be 18. So I'm looking for any row where the home team is Boston and checking if the points in that row are indeed 18.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Home is Oakland, so not relevant.\nRow 2: Home is Pittsburgh, not Boston.\nRow 3: Home is St. Louis.\nRow 4: Home is Pittsburgh.\nRow 5: Home is Minnesota.\nRow 6: Home is Pittsburgh.\nRow 7: Home is Boston! Here's the one we're interested in.\n\nIn Row 7, let's check the points column. The points are listed as 18. That matches the claim exactly. So this row supports the statement that when the home team is Boston, the points are 18.\n\nNow, I should also make sure there are no other rows where the home team is Boston to confirm consistency. Scanning through all rows:\n\nRows 1-6: Home teams are not Boston.\nRow 7: Home is Boston, points 18.\nRows 8-14: The rest don't have Boston as the home team.\n\nSo only Row 7 meets the condition of being a home game for Boston. Since in that case the points are indeed 18, the claim holds true.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cell is in row 7 (index starting at 0) and the \"points\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"2 - 3 be score , when visitor be pittsburgh , and when point be less than 20\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse each condition in the claim:\n\n1. The score must be \"2 - 3\".\n2. The visitor team must be Pittsburgh.\n3. The points for that game should be less than 20.\n\nI need to check each row of the table to see if there's a match for all these conditions simultaneously.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Visitor is Pittsburgh, score is 4-4. Points are 15. So points are less than 20 here, but the score doesn't match 2-3. So this doesn't satisfy all conditions.\n\nRow 2: Visitor is Detroit, not Pittsburgh, so irrelevant.\n\nRow 3: Visitor is Pittsburgh, score is 1-1. Points are 16, which is less than 20. But score isn't 2-3. Doesn't fit.\n\nRow 4: Visitor is Toronto, not relevant.\n\nRow 5: Visitor is Pittsburgh, score is 4-2. Points are 18 <20. Score doesn't match 2-3.\n\nRow 6: Visitor is LA, irrelevant.\n\nRow 7: Visitor is Pittsburgh, score is 3-5. Points are 18<20. Still not the right score.\n\nRow 8: Visitor is Pittsburgh, score is 2-8. Points are 18 <20. Score isn't 2-3.\n\nRow 9: Visitor is Minnesota, irrelevant.\n\nRow 10: Visitor is Pittsburgh, score is 1-3. Points are 18<20. Close, but the score is 1-3, not 2-3.\n\nRow 11: Visitor is Detroit, irrelevant.\n\nRow 12: Visitor is Pittsburgh, score is 2-3. Wait, let me check points here. The points column for row 12 is 20. But the condition is that points must be less than 20. So even though the score and visitor are correct, the points are exactly 20, not less than. Therefore, this doesn't satisfy all conditions.\n\nRow 13: Visitor is Oakland, irrelevant.\n\nRow 14: Visitor is Montreal, irrelevant.\n\nSo, after checking all rows, I don't find any row where all three conditions are met. The only row that has the score 2-3 and visitor Pittsburgh is row 12, but in that case, points are exactly 20, not less than 20. Therefore, there's no row that satisfies all parts of the claim.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE because there's no data supporting all three conditions together.\n</think>\n\nThe claim requires checking if any game where Pittsburgh was the visitor had a score of 2-3 and points less than 20. Only Row 12 meets two conditions but fails on points being exactly 20.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"when home be boston , the lowest point be 10\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It says that when the 'home' team is Boston, the lowest points are 10. So I need to look for any rows where the home team is Boston and check the points in those rows. If the lowest points in such cases are exactly 10, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are 14 rows of data. Each row has columns: date, visitor, score, home, attendance, record, points. I'll go through each row to find where 'home' is Boston.\n\nRow 7 has home as Boston. Let me check what the points column says for that row. The points in Row 7 are 18. \n\nWait, but according to the claim, when home is Boston, the lowest point should be 10. But in this case, there's only one instance where home is Boston, and the points are 18, not 10. So that means the lowest point when home is Boston isn't 10\u2014it's actually higher than that.\n\nSo since there's no row where 'home' is Boston with points equal to or lower than 10 (in fact, it's 18), the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that when the home team is Boston, the lowest points are 10. However, in the table, the only instance of Boston as the home team has points at 18, which doesn't support the claim.\n\n**Answer: FALSE**\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"the sum of point be 18 , when home be pittsburgh , when date be after december 21 , and when attendance be smaller than 5307\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse each condition:\n\n1. **Home is Pittsburgh**: We're only looking at rows where the 'home' column is \"pittsburgh\".\n2. **Date after December 21**: So dates must be December 22 or later.\n3. **Attendance smaller than 5307**: The attendance number in that row should be less than 5307.\n\nFor each of these conditions, I'll check the relevant rows and columns.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRows where 'home' is Pittsburgh are rows 1-8 except for row 9. Wait no, let me check each row:\n\n- Row 1: home oakland \u2192 not pittsburgh.\n- Row 2: home pittsburgh \u2192 yes.\n- Row 3: home st louis \u2192 no.\n- Row 4: home pittsburgh \u2192 yes.\n- Row 5: home minnesota \u2192 no.\n- Row 6: home pittsburgh \u2192 yes.\n- Row 7: home boston \u2192 no.\n- Row 8: home philadelphia \u2192 no.\n- Row 9: home pittsburgh \u2192 yes.\n- Row 10: home chicago \u2192 no.\n- Row 11: home pittsburgh \u2192 yes.\n- Row 12: home st louis \u2192 no.\n- Row 13: home pittsburgh \u2192 yes.\n- Row 14: home pittsburgh \u2192 yes.\n\nWait, actually row 9 is home pittsburgh? Let me check. Yes, row 9 has 'home' as pittsburgh. So rows that meet the 'home' condition are:\n\nRow 2, Row 4, Row 6, Row 9, Row 11, Row 13, Row 14.\n\nNow, among these, we need to find those where date is after December 21. Let's see which of these rows have dates after Dec 21:\n\n- Row 2: Dec 4 \u2192 before.\n- Row 4: Dec 8 \u2192 before.\n- Row 6: Dec 14 \u2192 before.\n- Row 9: Dec 21 \u2192 date is exactly December 21, so not \"after\".\n- Row 11: Dec 25 \u2192 after.\n- Row 13: Dec 28 \u2192 after.\n- Row 14: Dec 31 \u2192 after.\n\nSo the relevant rows are 11, 13, and 14.\n\nNow, from these three rows, we need to check if their attendance is smaller than 5307.\n\nLet's look at each:\n\n- Row 11: attendance 2420 \u2192 less than 5307.\n- Row 13: attendance 8196 \u2192 more than 5307.\n- Row 14: attendance 3979 \u2192 less than 5307.\n\nSo only rows 11 and 14 meet all three conditions (home is pittsburgh, date after Dec 21, attendance <5307).\n\nNow, the claim says that the sum of 'points' under these conditions should be 18. Let's check the points for these rows:\n\n- Row 11: points = 20\n- Row 14: points = 20\n\nWait, adding them together would give 20 + 20 = 40, which is not equal to 18. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Does it mean that each row's 'points' equals 18 under these conditions? Or does it mean the sum across all such rows is 18?\n\nThe wording says \"the sum of point be 18\", so probably it's referring to the total sum.\n\nBut let's see: for the relevant rows (11 and 14), their points are both 20 each. So 20 + 20 = 40, which is not 18. Therefore, the claim would be FALSE.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I made a mistake in identifying the correct rows.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\nRows where 'home' is pittsburgh and date after Dec 21: rows 11 (Dec25), 13 (Dec28), 14 (Dec31).\n\nFrom these, attendance <5307:\n\nRow 11: 2420 <5307 \u2192 yes.\nRow 13: 8196 >5307 \u2192 no.\nRow 14: 3979 <5307 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo rows 11 and 14 are the ones that meet all conditions. Their points are both 20 each, so sum is 40, not 18.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the sum of points under these conditions is 40, not 18.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread the rows. Let me check row 9: home pittsburgh, date Dec21. Since the condition is 'after' December 21, Dec21 itself doesn't count. So only rows after Dec21 are considered.\n\nThus, the sum of points for rows 11 and 14 is 20 + 20 = 40, which does not equal 18. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is evaluated by checking rows where 'home' is Pittsburgh, date is after December 21, and attendance is less than 5307. The sum of points in these qualifying rows (rows 11 and 14) equals 40, not 18.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
