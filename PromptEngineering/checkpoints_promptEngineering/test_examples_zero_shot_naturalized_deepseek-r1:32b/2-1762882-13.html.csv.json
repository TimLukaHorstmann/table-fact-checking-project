    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"during the 2003 - 04 scottish football season scotland score 0 point 3 time.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It's stating that in the 2003-04 Scottish football season, Scotland scored zero points three times. Wait, scoring zero points? That doesn't quite make sense because in most sports, including football (soccer), a team earns points based on wins and draws. Typically, a win gives 3 points, a draw gives 1 point each, and a loss gives nothing.\n\nSo, if Scotland scored zero points three times, that would mean they lost those matches, right? Because losing doesn't give any points. So the claim is saying that in the 2003-04 season, Scotland had three games where they didn't earn any points, which implies they lost three games.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, I see there are ten rows of data. Each row has information about a match: date, venue, score, competition, and report from BBC Sport. The venues include places like Ullevaal Stadium in Oslo, Hampden Park in Glasgow, etc. The scores show the results of each match.\n\nMy task is to check if Scotland scored zero points three times in that season. To do this, I need to look for matches where Scotland lost, meaning their score was lower than the opponent's, resulting in zero points for those games.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1:** Date: 20 August, Venue: Ullevaal Stadium, Oslo (a), Score: 0-0, Competition: Friendly, Report: BBC Sport.\n   - The score is a draw, so both teams get 1 point each. So Scotland didn't lose here; they drew. So this doesn't count towards the claim.\n\n2. **Row 2:** Date: 6 September, Venue: Hampden Park, Glasgow (h), Score: 3-1, Competition: ECQG5, Report: BBC Sport.\n   - Here, Scotland is at home and scored 3 goals against 1. That's a win for them, so they get 3 points. This doesn't support the claim.\n\n3. **Row 3:** Date: 10 September, Venue: Westfalenstadion, Dortmund (a), Score: 1-2, Competition: ECQG5, Report: BBC Sport.\n   - Scotland is away and lost 1-2. So they got zero points here. This counts as one loss.\n\n4. **Row 4:** Date: 11 October, Venue: Hampden Park, Glasgow (h), Score: 1-0, Competition: ECQG5, Report: BBC Sport.\n   - Scotland won this match, so they get 3 points. Not relevant to the claim.\n\n5. **Row 5:** Date: 15 November, Venue: Hampden Park, Glasgow (h), Score: 1-0, Competition: ECQPO, Report: BBC Sport.\n   - Another win for Scotland, getting 3 points. Doesn't support the claim.\n\n6. **Row 6:** Date: 19 November, Venue: Amsterdam Arena, Amsterdam (a), Score: 0-6, Competition: ECQPO, Report: BBC Sport.\n   - Scotland lost badly here with a score of 0-6. That's another loss, so zero points. Now we have two losses.\n\n7. **Row 7:** Date: 31 March, Venue: Hampden Park, Glasgow (h), Score: 1-2, Competition: Friendly, Report: BBC Sport.\n   - Scotland lost this friendly match with a score of 1-2. That's another zero points. Now we have three losses.\n\n8. **Row 8:** Date: 28 April, Venue: Parken Stadium, Copenhagen (a), Score: 0-1, Competition: Friendly, Report: BBC Sport.\n   - Scotland lost again with a score of 0-1. That's four losses, but the claim only mentions three times.\n\n9. **Row 9:** Date: 27 May, Venue: A Le Coq Arena, Tallinn (a), Score: 1-0, Competition: Friendly, Report: BBC Sport.\n   - Scotland won this match, so they get points here. Doesn't support the claim.\n\n10. **Row 10:** Date: 30 May, Venue: Easter Road, Edinburgh (h), Score: 4-1, Competition: Friendly, Report: BBC Sport.\n    - Another win for Scotland, getting 3 points. Not relevant to the claim.\n\nSo from the table, Scotland lost in Rows 3, 6, 7, and 8. That's four instances where they scored zero points. The claim states that it happened three times. Since there are actually four losses (and thus four times scoring zero points), the claim is technically not fully accurate. However, maybe I'm miscounting or misunderstanding.\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\n- Row 3: loss\n- Row 6: loss\n- Row 7: loss\n- Row 8: loss\n\nYes, that's four losses where they scored zero points. The claim says three times. So the claim is incorrect because it happened more than three times.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding what \"score 0 point\" means. Maybe it refers to when Scotland didn't score any goals? Let me check again:\n\nIn Row 1: 0-0, so both teams scored zero.\nRow 6: 0-6, Scotland scored zero.\n\nSo in these two cases, Scotland scored zero goals. But the claim is about scoring zero points, which relates to not earning any points, meaning losing the match. So it's more accurate to count the number of losses (zero points) rather than the number of times they didn't score a goal.\n\nGiven that, Scotland lost four times in this season according to the table, so the claim of three times is FALSE.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The competition codes are ECQG5 and ECQPO\u2014maybe these are qualifiers for European Championships or something? Could there be more context? But given just the data here, four losses with zero points each.\n\nTherefore, the claim that it happened three times is incorrect because it actually occurred four times. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe task was to determine if Scotland scored zero points in three matches during the specified season based on the provided data. By analyzing each match result, we found that Scotland lost four times (Rows 3, 6, 7, and 8), resulting in zero points for each of these matches. Since the claim states it happened three times but actually occurred four times, the answer is:\n\n**Answer:** False",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"During the 2003 - 04 Scottish football season, Scotland play at Hampden Park, Glasgow 4 times.\"\n\nFirst, let's parse the components of the claim:\n1. The time frame is the 2003-04 season.\n2. The location is Hampden Park in Glasgow.\n3. Scotland played there four times.\n\nNow, I'll examine the table to see how many matches were held at Hampden Park during that period. Looking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Date 20 August, Venue Ullevaal Stadium, Oslo (Away), Competition Friendly. Not Hampden Park.\n- Row 2: Date 6 September, Venue Hampden Park, Glasgow (Home), Score 3-1, Competition ECQG5. This counts as one match at Hampden Park.\n- Row 4: Date 11 October, Venue Hampden Park, Glasgow (Home), Score 1-0, Competition ECQG5. Second match at Hampden Park.\n- Row 5: Date 15 November, Venue Hampden Park, Glasgow (Home), Score 1-0, Competition ECQPO. Third match.\n- Row 7: Date 31 March, Venue Hampden Park, Glasgow (Home), Score 1-2, Competition Friendly. Fourth match.\n\nRows 3, 6, 8, 9, and 10 are at different venues or away matches, so they don't count towards the claim.\n\nI found four instances where Scotland played at Hampden Park during that season: Rows 2, 4, 5, and 7.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"during the 2003 - 04 scottish football season scotland hold their competition to 0 point 4 time.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means.\n\n- **Competition**: It's about competitions Scotland participated in during the specified season.\n- **0 points**: This likely refers to matches where Scotland didn't score any goals (a 0-x score) or maybe they got zero points from those games. However, looking at the table, I don't see a column for points; instead, there's \"score,\" which shows the match outcome in terms of goals.\n- **4 times**: The claim suggests that Scotland had four such instances where they either didn't score (0-x) or perhaps drew without scoring.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists several matches with dates, venues, scores, competitions, and reports. Let's analyze each row for relevant information.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Date: 20 August, Venue: Ullevaal Stadium, Oslo (A), Score: 0-0, Competition: Friendly\n   - The score is 0-0, meaning Scotland didn't score any goals beyond what's reflected in the draw.\n\n2. **Row 2**: Date: 6 September, Venue: Hampden Park, Glasgow (H), Score: 3-1, Competition: ECQG5\n   - Here, Scotland scored 3 goals; so this doesn't fit the 0-point scenario.\n\n3. **Row 3**: Date: 10 September, Venue: Westfalenstadion, Dortmund (A), Score: 1-2, Competition: ECQG5\n   - Scotland scored 1 goal here; again, not a 0.\n\n4. **Row 4**: Date: 11 October, Venue: Hampden Park, Glasgow (H), Score: 1-0, Competition: ECQG5\n   - They scored 1, so no.\n\n5. **Row 5**: Date: 15 November, Venue: Hampden Park, Glasgow (H), Score: 1-0, Competition: ECQPO\n   - Scotland scored 1; not a 0.\n\n6. **Row 6**: Date: 19 November, Venue: Amsterdam Arena, Amsterdam (A), Score: 0-6, Competition: ECQPO\n   - Here, the score is 0-6. So Scotland didn't score any goals in this match.\n\n7. **Row 7**: Date: 31 March, Venue: Hampden Park, Glasgow (H), Score: 1-2, Competition: Friendly\n   - They scored 1; not a 0.\n\n8. **Row 8**: Date: 28 April, Venue: Parken Stadium, Copenhagen (A), Score: 0-1, Competition: Friendly\n   - Scotland didn't score here, so this is another instance of 0 points in terms of goals scored.\n\n9. **Row 9**: Date: 27 May, Venue: A Le Coq Arena, Tallinn (A), Score: 1-0, Competition: Friendly\n   - They scored 1; not relevant.\n\n10. **Row 10**: Date: 30 May, Venue: Easter Road, Edinburgh (H), Score: 4-1, Competition: Friendly\n    - Scotland scored 4 goals here; definitely not a 0.\n\nNow, compiling the instances where Scotland either had a score of 0 or didn't score any goals:\n\n- Row 1: 0-0\n- Row 6: 0-6 (Scotland scored 0)\n- Row 8: 0-1 (Scotland scored 0)\n\nThat's three matches where Scotland's score was 0. The claim mentions four times, but according to the table, it's only three instances.\n\nWait a second\u2014maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check each row:\n\nRow 1: 0-0 \u2013 both teams scored 0; that's one instance where Scotland didn't score beyond what's reflected in their goals (they drew without scoring more than 0).\n\nRows 6 and 8 are clear instances where Scotland scored 0.\n\nSo, total of three matches where Scotland either drew with a 0 or lost without scoring. The claim says four times. Therefore, the number doesn't add up.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe considering \"hold their competition to 0 points\" as not winning any points? But in soccer, a draw gives each team one point, so in Row 1, Scotland would have gotten one point, which isn't zero. So perhaps that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is referring to matches where Scotland lost, meaning they got zero points (since they lost). Let me check how many losses there are:\n\n- Row 6: Loss (0-6)\n- Row 8: Loss (0-1)\n\nThat's two losses. So if considering only losses as getting zero points, it's two instances.\n\nAlternatively, the claim might be mixing up not scoring any goals and not winning points. But regardless, the table shows three instances where Scotland scored 0 or drew with 0, but not four.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there are only three such matches, not four.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim about Scotland's football matches during the 2003-04 season is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll restate the claim: \"During the 2003 - 04 Scottish football season, Scotland plays at Hampden Park, Glasgow three more times than they do Ullevaal Stadium, Oslo.\" \n\nSo, we need to check how many times Scotland played at each of these venues and see if Hampden Park was used three times more often than Ullevaal Stadium.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 10 rows of data. Each row represents a match with details like date, venue, score, competition, and report source.\n\nLet's identify which rows involve matches played at Hampden Park and Ullevaal Stadium.\n\nStarting with Hampden Park:\n- Row 2: Date 6 September, Venue Hampden Park, Glasgow (h), Score 3-1, Competition ECQG5.\n- Row 4: Date 11 October, Venue Hampden Park, Glasgow (h), Score 1-0, Competition ECQG5.\n- Row 5: Date 15 November, Venue Hampden Park, Glasgow (h), Score 1-0, Competition ECQPO.\n- Row 7: Date 31 March, Venue Hampden Park, Glasgow (h), Score 1-2, Competition friendly.\n\nThat's a total of four matches at Hampden Park.\n\nNow, checking Ullevaal Stadium:\n- Row 1: Date 20 August, Venue Ullevaal Stadium, Oslo (a), Score 0-0, Competition friendly.\n\nOnly one match was played at Ullevaal Stadium.\n\nThe claim states that Scotland played three more times at Hampden Park than at Ullevaal Stadium.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"during the 2003 - scottish football season scotland beat easter road 3 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two main points:\n\n1. The timeframe: 2003 Scottish football season.\n2. Scotland beating Easter Road three times during that season.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice it has rows with dates ranging from August 20 to May 30. Since the years aren't explicitly mentioned in each row, I have to infer if these games are all part of the same season. The 2003-2004 football season is typically when such a span would fall because it starts in summer and ends in spring.\n\nNext, let's check for matches at Easter Road. Scanning through the venue column:\n\n- Row 1: Ullevaal Stadium, Oslo (A)\n- Row 2: Hampden Park, Glasgow (H)\n- Row 3: Westfalenstadion, Dortmund (A)\n- Row 4: Hampden Park, Glasgow (H)\n- Row 5: Hampden Park, Glasgow (H)\n- Row 6: Amsterdam Arena, Amsterdam (A)\n- Row 7: Hampden Park, Glasgow (H)\n- Row 8: Parken Stadium, Copenhagen (A)\n- Row 9: A Le Coq Arena, Tallinn (A)\n- Row 10: Easter Road, Edinburgh (H)\n\nOnly Row 10 has Easter Road as the venue. Now, checking if Scotland won this match. The score is 4 - 1 in favor of Scotland (since it's marked as home). So they did beat the opponent at Easter Road once.\n\nThe claim says they beat Easter Road three times, but according to the table, there's only one instance where the venue was Easter Road and Scotland won. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"during the 2003 - 04 scottish football season scotland score 4 point only 1 time.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of the claim means. The key points here are:\n1. Timeframe: 2003-04 Scottish football season.\n2. Scotland's score was 4 points.\n3. This happened only once.\n\nLooking at the table, it has rows with dates, venues, scores, competitions, and reports. I notice that each row corresponds to a match, with details like when it was played, where, the result, etc.\n\nThe claim mentions \"scottish football season\" so I'm assuming we're looking for matches involving Scotland. The score mentioned is 4 points, which in football terms typically refers to goals. So the claim is saying that Scotland scored exactly 4 goals only once during this season.\n\nNow, checking each row:\n\nRow 1: Score 0-0. Not relevant because it's a draw and doesn't show any team scoring 4.\nRow 2: Score 3-1. So one team scored 3, the other 1. No 4 here.\nRow 3: 1-2. Again, no 4.\nRow 4: 1-0. Only one goal for Scotland maybe? But not 4.\nRow 5: 1-0 again. Same as above.\nRow 6: 0-6. One team scored 6, the other none. Not relevant to 4.\nRow 7: 1-2. No 4 here.\nRow 8: 0-1. Again, no 4.\nRow 9: 1-0. Still no 4.\nRow 10: Score is 4-1. So one team scored 4 goals.\n\nNow, I need to check which team scored the 4. The venue for Row 10 is Easter Road, Edinburgh (h), so probably the home team scored 4 and lost 1? Or won? Wait, the score is 4-1, so if it's a home game, the home team would have scored 4 and perhaps lost or won depending on context. But looking at the report being BBC Sport, I can't be sure without more info.\n\nBut wait, the competition for Row 10 is friendly. The claim says during the 2003-04 season. If the match in Row 10 was part of that season, then it's relevant. However, the dates need to fall within that timeframe. Let me check the dates:\n\nRow 1: 20 August\nRow 2: 6 September\nRow 3: 10 September\nRow 4: 11 October\nRow 5: 15 November\nRow 6: 19 November\nRow 7: 31 March (next year)\nRow 8: 28 April (next year)\nRow 9: 27 May (next year)\nRow 10: 30 May (next year)\n\nAssuming the season runs from August to May, but usually football seasons are split into two parts. The 2003-04 season would run from August 2003 to May 2004. So all these dates fall within that period except maybe March-May if it's a different structure.\n\nSo Row 10 is on 30 May, which is in May 2004, so part of the same season. The score here is 4-1. Assuming the home team (Easter Road, Edinburgh) scored 4 goals. If that was Scotland, then yes, they scored 4 points once.\n\nLooking at other rows, none have a score where either team scored exactly 4 goals except Row 10. So only one instance of a 4-goal score in this table.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"Scotland score 4 point only 1 time.\" If Scotland was the team scoring 4, then yes. However, sometimes the way scores are presented can be ambiguous. For example, in some tables, it's Home - Away. So Row 10: Easter Road is home (h), so they scored 4, and the away team scored 1.\n\nAssuming Scotland was playing at home here, which makes sense since the venue is Edinburgh, a Scottish city, then yes, Scotland scored 4 goals in this match. \n\nSo according to the table, there's only one instance where 4 goals were scored by a team (presumably Scotland) in their matches during that season. Therefore, the claim seems supported.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure all other rows don't have any 4-goal scores. Checking again:\n\nRows 1-9: No scores with 4 except Row 10. So yes, only one time.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Scotland scored exactly four goals in one match during the specified season.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. So, the claim says: \"during the 2003 - scottish football season glasgow hold their competition back 4 time.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The key points here are:\n\n1. Timeframe: 2003 Scottish football season.\n2. Location: Glasgow.\n3. Action: \"hold their competition back 4 times.\"\n\nHmm, the phrasing is a bit unclear. Does it mean that Glasgow hosted four competitions during that season? Or does it refer to something else?\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see ten rows of data about various football matches. Each row has details like date, venue, score, competition type, and report source.\n\nI need to focus on rows where the venue is in Glasgow because the claim is about Glasgow hosting competitions. Let's go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Venue is Ullevaal Stadium, Oslo (A). Not Glasgow.\n- Row 2: Hampden Park, Glasgow (H). This is a home game for Scotland or the host team in Glasgow.\n- Row 3: Westfalenstadion, Dortmund (A). Away venue, not relevant.\n- Row 4: Hampden Park again, same as row 2. Another competition here.\n- Row 5: Hampden Park once more. This seems like another match held in Glasgow.\n- Row 6: Amsterdam Arena, away. Not relevant.\n- Rows 7-10: Some are in Glasgow (Row 7 is Hampden Park), others not.\n\nWait, so let's count how many times competitions were held in Glasgow:\n\n- Row 2: Competition type ECQG5\n- Row 4: Competition type ECQG5\n- Row 5: Competition type ECQPO\n- Row 7: Friendly competition\n\nSo that's four instances where the venue is Hampden Park in Glasgow. Each row represents a separate match, so each counts as a time they \"held their competition.\"\n\nBut I should check if these are all within the same season. The dates range from August 20 to May 30. Since football seasons typically span a year, and 2003 would include games in late 2003 and early 2004. But the claim is about the 2003 Scottish season, so I think it's acceptable as all these dates fall within that period.\n\nWait, but the competition types vary: ECQG5 appears twice (Rows 2 and 4), ECQPO once (Row 5), and a friendly once (Row7). So, four competitions in total held in Glasgow during that time. \n\nSo the claim is saying they held their competition back 4 times, which matches with the data showing four rows where Glasgow was the venue.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be TRUE based on the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that during the 2003 Scottish football season, Glasgow hosted four competitions. The table shows four instances where the venue is Hampden Park in Glasgow (Rows 2, 4, 5, and 7). Each of these rows represents a separate competition held in Glasgow.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"during the 2003 - scottish football season scotland play at amsterdam 2 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It's saying that Scotland played in Amsterdam twice during their 2003-Scottish football season.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like date, venue, score, etc. The key columns here are \"date\" and \"venue\".\n\nI need to check for matches where the venue is in Amsterdam and count how many times Scotland played there during that season.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\nRow 1: Venue is Ullevaal Stadium in Oslo (away). Not Amsterdam.\nRow 2: Hampden Park in Glasgow (home). Not Amsterdam.\nRow 3: Westfalenstadion in Dortmund (away). Not Amsterdam.\nRow 4: Hampden Park again. Home, not relevant.\nRow 5: Hampden Park again. Still home, no Amsterdam.\nRow 6: Venue is Amsterdam Arena, location Amsterdam (away). So this is one instance of playing in Amsterdam.\nRow 7: Hampden Park again. Home, not Amsterdam.\nRow 8: Parken Stadium in Copenhagen (away). Not Amsterdam.\nRow 9: A Le Coq Arena in Tallinn (away). Not Amsterdam.\nRow 10: Easter Road in Edinburgh (home). Not Amsterdam.\n\nSo, from the table, Scotland only played once at Amsterdam Arena on November 19th. There's no other match listed where they were playing in Amsterdam.\n\nTherefore, the claim that they played twice is FALSE. Only one instance exists in the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Scotland played twice in Amsterdam during their 2003 season. Checking each row, only row 6 shows a match at Amsterdam Arena. Thus, the claim is incorrect as it mentions two visits when there's only one.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"during the scottish football season scotland play easter road , edinburgh 5 time more than hampden park , glasgow.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse what exactly the claim is stating. It seems like it's comparing how many times Scotland played at Easter Road, Edinburgh versus Hampden Park, Glasgow during their season. The claim suggests that they played at Easter Road five times more than at Hampden Park.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like date, venue, score, competition, etc. I need to count how many matches were played at Easter Road, Edinburgh and how many were at Hampden Park, Glasgow.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Venue is Ullevaal Stadium, Oslo (A) \u2013 not either of the venues in question.\nRow 2: Hampden Park, Glasgow (H) \u2013 so this counts for Hampden Park.\nRow 3: Westfalenstadion, Dortmund (A) \u2013 irrelevant.\nRow 4: Hampden Park, Glasgow (H) \u2013 another count for Hampden.\nRow 5: Hampden Park again (H).\nRow 6: Amsterdam Arena, Amsterdam (A) \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 7: Hampden Park (H) again? Wait no, row 7's venue is Hampden Park, but the score is 1-2, and competition friendly. So that's another Hampden match.\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRows with Hampden Park as home (H):\nRow 2, Row 4, Row5, Row7 \u2013 that's four matches at Hampden.\n\nNow for Easter Road, Edinburgh:\nLooking through all rows, the only row mentioning Easter Road is Row 10: Venue is Easter Road, Edinburgh (H), score 4-1. So that's one match.\n\nSo according to the table, Scotland played once at Easter Road and four times at Hampden Park. The claim says they played five times more at Easter Road than at Hampden. But clearly, 5 times more would mean if Hampden had x matches, Easter Road had 5x. However, in reality, it's the opposite: they played more at Hampden.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the claim. The claim says \"play easter road... 5 time more than hampden park\". So does that mean five times as many at Easter Road compared to Hampden? If so, then since Easter had 1 and Hampden had 4, 1 is not five times more than 4. In fact, it's less.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is saying they played five times in total at Easter Road and four times at Hampden, but that doesn't make sense because there's only one match at Easter Road.\n\nWait no, looking back: The table shows only one match at Easter Road (Row 10) and four matches at Hampden Park. So the claim is incorrect because they played fewer times at Easter Road than at Hampden, not five times more.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Scotland played five times more at Easter Road than at Hampden Park during their season. From the table, there's only one match at Easter Road and four matches at Hampden Park. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
