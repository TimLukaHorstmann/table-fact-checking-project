    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim and check each part against the data.\n\nThe claim states: \"In 2012, the Oakland Raiders lose to the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium with a result of 15-0.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for all rows in the table where the year is 2012. Scanning through the rows:\n\nRow 5: Year 2012, date October 28, winner Oakland Raiders, result 26-16, loser Kansas City Chiefs, location Arrowhead Stadium.\nRow 6: Year 2012, date December 16, winner Oakland Raiders, result 15-0, loser Kansas City Chiefs, location O.co Coliseum.\n\nSo there are two games in 2012 between these teams. Now, the claim mentions a loss by Oakland at Arrowhead Stadium with a score of 15-0. Let's check each relevant detail:\n\n1. Year: Both rows are from 2012, so that matches.\n2. Location: The claim specifies Arrowhead Stadium. Looking at Row 5, location is Arrowhead Stadium, but the Raiders won there with a result of 26-16. In Row 6, the location is O.co Coliseum where the Raiders also won with a result of 15-0.\n3. Result and Outcome: The claim says Oakland lost, but both entries show them as winners in 2012. The scores don't align with a loss for Oakland at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the claim. It says \"lose to Kansas City,\" meaning Oakland is the loser. But in both rows, Raiders are the winner. So there's no instance where Oakland lost to KC in 2012 at any stadium with that score.\n\nLooking again, maybe the claim mixed up the location? The only time KC won was in 2011 (Row 3) and 2013 (Row 7). In 2012, Raiders won both meetings. So the claim is incorrect because Oakland didn't lose at Arrowhead Stadium with a 15-0 result in 2012.\n\nWait, but Row 6 shows Raiders winning 15-0 at O.co Coliseum. Maybe the claim confused the location and result? The actual loss by Raiders would have to be elsewhere, but according to the table, they didn't lose in 2012.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are not supported: the Raiders won both games in 2012, so there's no instance where they lost at Arrowhead with a 15-0 result. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":5,\"column_name\":\"year\"},{\"row_index\":5,\"column_name\":\"location\"},{\"row_index\":6,\"column_name\":\"year\"},{\"row_index\":6,\"column_name\":\"result\"}]}\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows for 2012:** Look through the table for entries where the year is 2012. This gives us Row 5 and Row 6.\n\n2. **Check Location (Arrowhead Stadium):** In both relevant rows, check the location column. Only Row 5 mentions Arrowhead Stadium.\n\n3. **Verify Result at Arrowhead Stadium:** The result in Row 5 is Raiders winning 26-16, which contradicts the claim of a loss with a 15-0 score.\n\n4. **Check for Other Locations and Results:** In Row 6, the Raiders won 15-0 but at O.co Coliseum, not Arrowhead Stadium.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** There's no row where Oakland lost to Kansas City at Arrowhead Stadium in 2012 with a result of 15-0. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
