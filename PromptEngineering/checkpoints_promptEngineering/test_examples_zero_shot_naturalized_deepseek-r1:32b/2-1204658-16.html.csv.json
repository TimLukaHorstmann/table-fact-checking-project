    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"south melbourne score the most points out of every team\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table and note down the home and away teams along with their scores. The relevant columns are \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", and \"away team score\".\n\nRow 1: Home is Fitzroy (13.16 = 94 points), Away is University (11.7 = 73 points).\nRow 2: Home is Essendon (17.17 = 119 points), Away is Melbourne (8.11 = 59 points).\nRow 3: Home is Collingwood (10.10 = 70 points), Away is St Kilda (7.9 = 51 points).\nRow 4: Home is South Melbourne (18.12 = 120 points), Away is Richmond (4.4 = 28 points).\nRow 5: Home is Geelong (5.9 = 39 points), Away is Carlton (6.13 = 49 points).\n\nNow, I'll list all the teams and their respective scores:\n\nFitzroy: 94\nUniversity: 73\nEssendon: 119\nMelbourne: 59\nCollingwood: 70\nSt Kilda: 51\nSouth Melbourne: 120\nRichmond: 28\nGeelong: 39\nCarlton: 49\n\nLooking at all these scores, the highest is 120 points by South Melbourne. I'll check if any other team has a higher score than that. From the list above, it seems no other team scored more than 120. Therefore, South Melbourne indeed scored the most points.\n\nThe relevant cells are in Row 4 for both \"home team\" and \"home team score\" because that's where South Melbourne's high score is recorded.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"no team score more than 120 points in a game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each row of the table represents. Each row corresponds to a different game played on August 8, 1908, with details about both home and away teams, their scores, venue, and date.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions that no team scored more than 120 points in a single game. So, my main focus should be on the 'home team score' and 'away team score' columns for each row because these contain the points scored by each team in the games listed.\n\nLooking at Row 1:\n- Home Team: Fitzroy, Score: 13.16 (94)\n- Away Team: University, Score: 11.7 (73)\nBoth teams have scores below 120, so this row doesn't affect the claim.\n\nRow 2:\n- Home Team: Essendon, Score: 17.17 (119)\n- Away Team: Melbourne, Score: 8.11 (59)\nEssendon's score is 119, which is just below 120. Still, no team exceeds the threshold here.\n\nRow 3:\n- Home Team: Collingwood, Score: 10.10 (70)\n- Away Team: St Kilda, Score: 7.9 (51)\nBoth teams are well under 120 points in this game.\n\nRow 4:\n- Home Team: South Melbourne, Score: 18.12 (120)\n- Away Team: Richmond, Score: 4.4 (28)\nHere's where things get interesting. The home team, South Melbourne, scored exactly 120 points. The claim states \"no team scores more than 120,\" which means scoring exactly 120 would still be within the limit. However, if a team had scored above 120, that would make the claim false.\n\nRow 5:\n- Home Team: Geelong, Score: 5.9 (39)\n- Away Team: Carlton, Score: 6.13 (49)\nBoth teams are significantly below the 120-point threshold here.\n\nAfter reviewing all rows, I see that South Melbourne scored exactly 120 points, which is at the upper limit of the claim. Since the claim allows for a maximum of 120 and no team exceeds this, the claim holds true. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

To verify this, I should check each row's \"venue\" column and see if all venues are distinct.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. Row 1: Venue is brunswick street oval.\n2. Row 2: Venue is emcg.\n3. Row 3: Venue is victoria park.\n4. Row 4: Venue is lake oval.\n5.

There are no repeating venues across any rows. Therefore, each game was indeed played at a different venue.\n\nTo make sure I didn't miss anything, I'll cross-reference each row's venue with the others:\n\n- Row 1's venue doesn't match any other row.\n- Similarly, Rows 2 through 5 all have unique venues without overlap.\n\nSince all venues are distinct, the claim holds true.

The claim involves three teams: south melbourne, richmond, and carlton.\n\nLooking at row 4 of the table, which mentions south melbourne as the home team. Their score is 18.12 (120). So, their total points are 120.\n\nNow, I need to find Richmon'd's score. In the same row 4, the away team is richmond with a score of 4.4 (28), so they have 28 points.\n\nNext, looking for carlton's score. Carlton is mentioned as the away team in row 5.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"south melbourne score the least point out of every team\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states that South Melbourne has the lowest score among all teams mentioned in the table. So, I should check each team's score to see if South Melbourne indeed has the least points.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five rows, each representing a game with home and away teams. Each row includes the scores of both teams. My task is to find the total points for every team across all games and compare them to see if South Melbourne has the lowest.\n\nLet me list out all the teams first from each row:\n\nRow 1: Fitzroy (home), University (away)\nRow 2: Essendon (home), Melbourne (away)\nRow 3: Collingwood (home), St Kilda (away)\nRow 4: South Melbourne (home), Richmond (away)\nRow 5: Geelong (home), Carlton (away)\n\nSo the teams are Fitzroy, University, Essendon, Melbourne, Collingwood, St Kilda, South Melbourne, Richmond, Geelong, and Carlton.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to note down their scores. The score format is Goals.Behinds (Total points). To calculate total points, I know that in Australian Rules Football, a goal is worth 6 points and a behind is worth 1 point. So the formula for total points is Goals * 6 + Behinds.\n\nLet me compute each team's total points:\n\nRow 1:\n- Fitzroy: 13 goals, 16 behinds = (13*6) + 16 = 78 + 16 = 94 points\n- University: 11 goals, 7 behinds = (11*6) + 7 = 66 + 7 = 73 points\n\nRow 2:\n- Essendon: 17 goals, 17 behinds = (17*6) + 17 = 102 + 17 = 119 points\n- Melbourne: 8 goals, 11 behinds = (8*6) + 11 = 48 + 11 = 59 points\n\nRow 3:\n- Collingwood: 10 goals, 10 behinds = (10*6) + 10 = 60 + 10 = 70 points\n- St Kilda: 7 goals, 9 behinds = (7*6) + 9 = 42 + 9 = 51 points\n\nRow 4:\n- South Melbourne: 18 goals, 12 behinds = (18*6) + 12 = 108 + 12 = 120 points\n- Richmond: 4 goals, 4 behinds = (4*6) + 4 = 24 + 4 = 28 points\n\nRow 5:\n- Geelong: 5 goals, 9 behinds = (5*6) + 9 = 30 + 9 = 39 points\n- Carlton: 6 goals, 13 behinds = (6*6) + 13 = 36 + 13 = 49 points\n\nWait a minute, in Row 4, South Melbourne scored 18.12 which is 120 points. But the claim says they have the least. However, looking at other teams:\n\n- University: 73\n- Melbourne: 59\n- St Kilda: 51\n- Richmond: 28\n- Geelong: 39\n- Carlton:49\n\nWait, hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier because in Row 4, South Melbourne is the home team and scored 18.12 (120), but their away opponent Richmond only got 4.4 (28). So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, looking at all teams:\n\nFitzroy:94\nUniversity:73\nEssendon:119\nMelbourne:59\nCollingwood:70\nSt Kilda:51\nSouth Melbourne:120\nRichmond:28\nGeelong:39\nCarlton:49\n\nNow, looking for the lowest score. The scores are as follows:\n\nRichmond: 28 points (from Row 4)\nMelbourne:59 (Row 2 away)\nSt Kilda:51 (Row 3 away)\nUniversity:73 (Row1 away)\nGeelong:39 (Row5 home)\nCarlton:49 (Row5 away)\nFitzroy:94\nCollingwood:70\nEssendon:119\nSouth Melbourne:120\n\nSo, the lowest is Richmond with 28 points. Then St Kilda has 51, which is higher than 28. Similarly, Geelong is at 39.\n\nWait, but in Row4, South Melbourne scored 120 as home team, while Richmond, their opponent, only got 28. So Richmond's score is the lowest among all teams listed.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"south melbourne score the least point out of every team\" would be FALSE because Richmond actually has the lowest points at 28, not South Melbourne.\n\nSo to verify this, I need to look at all teams' scores in each row. The relevant cells are all the scores for each team across the table.\n\nIn terms of rows and columns:\n\n- Row1: Fitzroy (home) score and University (away) score\n- Row2: Essendon (home) and Melbourne (away)\n- Row3: Collingwood (home) and St Kilda (away)\n- Row4: South Melbourne (home) and Richmond (away)\n- Row5: Geelong (home) and Carlton (away)\n\nSo each row has two teams with their respective scores. The claim is about which team has the least, so all these cells are relevant because they contribute to determining whether South Melbourne is indeed the lowest.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because Richmond scored only 28 points, which is lower than South Melbourne's 120 and all other teams.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that South Melbourne scores the least points. However, upon examining all team scores in each row, Richmond has the lowest score at 28 points. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Away team University scored 73 points, also under 110. So this row doesn't affect the claim; it's fine.\n\nRow 2: Home team Essendon has a score of 119 points. Wait, that's more than 110. The away team Melbourne scored 59, which is okay. But since Essendon scored 119, this would make the claim false because they exceeded 110.\n\nI should check the other rows just to be thorough.

I'll note down the relevant cells as each row's \"venue\" column to support this conclusion.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether the claim \"south melbourne score less points than richmond and carlton combine\" is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to in the context of the table. The table lists several rows with details about different games played on August 8, 1908. Each row includes information like home team, their score, away team, their score, venue, and date.\n\nThe claim is comparing South Melbourne's score to the combined scores of Richmond and Carlton. So, I need to find where each of these teams appears in the table as either home or away teams and then extract their scores.\n\nLooking at Row 4: The home team is South Melbourne with a score of 18.12 (120), and the away team is Richmond with a score of 4.4 (28). So, South Melbourne's points are 120, and Richmond has 28.\n\nNow, I need to find Carlton's score. Looking through the other rows: Row 5 shows that Carlton is the away team against Geelong. Their score is 6.13 (49), so Carlton has 49 points.\n\nNext, I should add Richmond's and Carlton's points together. Richmond has 28, and Carlton has 49. Adding these gives 28 + 49 = 77 points combined.\n\nNow, comparing this to South Melbourne's score of 120. The claim states that South Melbourne scored less than the combined total of Richmond and Carlton. But here, 120 is more than 77. Therefore, the claim is false because South Melbourne actually scored more points than the sum of Richmond and Carlton's points.\n\nSo, to summarize: I looked up each team's score in their respective rows, added the relevant scores for Richmond and Carlton, compared it to South Melbourne's score, and concluded that the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
