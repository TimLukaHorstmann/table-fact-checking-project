    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"Two-thirds of the judge appoint have more than 10 year to go until their mandatory retirement.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's about judges who were appointed and how many years they have left until they retire. Specifically, it claims that two-thirds of these appointments have more than 10 years remaining.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are nine rows, each representing a different judge with details like name, rank, years until retirement, appointed by, and year appointed. My task is to check how many of these judges have more than 10 years until mandatory retirement.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Anabelle Rodr\u00edguez has 6 years left. That's less than 10, so she doesn't meet the condition.\nRow 2: Edgardo Rivera Garcia has 11 years. That's more than 10, so he does meet it.\nRow 3: Erick Kolthoff Caraballo has 17 years. Also meets the condition.\nRow 4: Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton has 0 years. Definitely doesn't meet it.\nRow 5: Liana Fiol Matta has 2 years. Doesn't meet.\nRow 6: Luis Estrella Mart\u00ednez has 27 years. Meets.\nRow 7: Mildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco has 13 years. Meets.\nRow 8: Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres has 15 years. Meets.\nRow 9: Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n has 19 years. Meets.\n\nNow, let's count how many meet the condition of having more than 10 years:\n\nRows 2,3,6,7,8,9. That's six rows out of nine.\n\nThe claim says two-thirds of the appoints have more than 10 years. Two-thirds of nine is six (since 9 \u00f7 3 = 3; 3 \u00d7 2 = 6). So exactly two-thirds meet the condition.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n appointed all her justices in 2004 and didn't make any appointments outside of that year. So my task is to check if every justice appointed by her was indeed in 2004.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a justice with details like name, rank, years until retirement, who appointed them, and the year they were appointed. I need to focus on two columns: \"appointed by\" and \"year appointed\".\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n in 2004. That fits the claim.\n2. **Row 4**: Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton, also appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n in 2004. Still consistent.\n3. **Row 5**: Liana Fiol Matta, same here\u2014appointed by her in 2004. So far so good.\n\nNow, I should check if there are any other justices appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n outside of 2004. Scanning through the rest:\n\n- Rows 2,3,6,7,8,9: All these are appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o in various years (2010, 2009, 2011). So they don't affect our claim since we're only concerned with Calder\u00f3n's appointments.\n\nSo all justices appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n were indeed in 2004. There are no entries where she appointed someone in a different year. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nTo gather the relevant cells, I need to note down the rows and columns that support this conclusion. The relevant information is found in the \"appointed by\" and \"year appointed\" columns for each row where the appointing authority is Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n. That's Rows 1,4,5, specifically looking at \"appointed by\" and \"year appointed\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all justices appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n were in 2004.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"only 1 of the justice be appoint in 2010\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim correctly. It says only one justice was appointed in 2010. So I should check how many justices have the yearappointed as 2010.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Year appointed 2004\nRow 2: Year appointed 2010\nRow 3: 2009\nRow 4: 2004\nRow 5: 2004\nRow 6: 2011\nRow 7: 2009\nRow 8: 2009\nRow 9: 2011\n\nOnly Row 2 has the year 2010. So only one justice was appointed in that year.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cell is row index 1 (since rows are zero-indexed? Wait, no, looking back at the example given, the first row is row_0 or row_1? In the initial table, Row 1 is index 0 maybe? Or perhaps the example shows rows starting from 0.\n\nWait in the example provided, the output had \"row_index\": 0 and 1. So I think the table starts at row_index 0 for Row 1.\n\nBut in our case, looking back, the first row is labeled as Row 1 with name anabelle rodr\u00edguez. So probably, the rows are zero-indexed here as well, so Row 2 would be index 1. But to confirm:\n\nRow numbers as per user's table:\nRow 1: anabelle rodr\u00edguez - year appointed 2004\nRow 2: edgardo rivera garcia - 2010\nSo in the JSON example, row indexes start at 0 for the first data row. So Row 1 is index 0, Row 2 is index 1.\n\nWait no, looking back, the user's instruction says \"Row 1: name: anabelle rodr\u00edguez...\", which would be the first entry. In JSON, arrays are zero-indexed, so the first item is index 0.\n\nTherefore, in the table:\n\n- Row 1 (name anabelle) \u2192 row_index 0\n- Row 2 (edgardo) \u2192 row_index 1\n\nSo the justice appointed in 2010 is edgardo rivera garcia at row index 1. So relevant_cells would be [{\"row_0\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year appointed\"}.\n\nWait no: in JSON, each cell is specified by row index and column name. The claim refers to the yearappointed being 2010. So for each justice, check if their 'year appointed' is 2010.\n\nSo, I need to list all cells where 'yearappointed' is 2010.\n\nLooking through:\n\nRow 0: 2004\nRow 1: 2010 \u2192 relevant\nRows 2-9: others have years not 2010.\n\nThus, only one cell meets the condition.

Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. There are 9 rows, each representing a judge with details like name, rank, years until mandatory retirement, appointed by, and year appointed.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"chief justice,\" so my first thought is to check which row(s) have that rank. Looking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Associate Justice\n- Row 2: Associate Justice\n- Row 3: Associate Justice\n- Row 4: Chief Justice\n- Rows 5-9: All Associate Justices\n\nSo, only Row 4 has the rank of Chief Justice. Now, I need to check how long this judge served as Chief Justice.\n\nThe claim states that \"none lasted more than a year.\" To assess this, I should look at when the judge was appointed and calculate their tenure until their mandatory retirement or until now if they're still serving.\n\nLooking at Row 4:\n- Year appointed: 2004\n- Years until mandatory retirement: 0 years\n\nIf the current year is not specified, but since the table doesn't provide a current year, I can assume it's up to the present. The fact that there are 0 years left until retirement suggests that they are about to retire or have already retired. However, without knowing the exact current year, I'll consider their appointment in 2004.\n\nIf we take the current year as 2023 (since this is a realistic timeframe), then the tenure would be from 2004 to 2023, which is 19 years. This clearly exceeds one year.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"none lasted more than a year.\" But if they've been in office for almost two decades, that's way more than a year. Therefore, the claim is false because at least one chief justice served longer than a year.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells:\n- The rank cell (row 4, column \"rank\") shows they're Chief Justice.\n- The year appointed (2004) and years until retirement (0) indicate their tenure duration.\n\nSo, I'll include these three cells in the relevant_cells list. \n\nWait, but does the claim refer to all chief justices? Since there's only one, the existence of even one who served longer than a year makes the claim false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Chief Justice Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton was appointed in 2004 and has been serving for over a decade.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year appointed\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table and check who appointed each associate justice. The relevant columns here are \"name\", \"rank\", \"appointed by\", and \"year appointed\".\n\nStarting with Row 1: Anabelle Rodr\u00edguez was appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n in 2004. So, not Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n\nRow 2: Edgardo Rivera Garcia was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o in 2010. That's one appointment by Fortu\u00f1o already.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"1 of the judge be appoint\", which I think means at least one judge was appointed by Fortu\u00f1o. Since Row 2 is from Fortu\u00f1o, that makes the statement true.\n\nHowever, looking further just to be thorough:\n\nRow 3: Erick Kolthoff Caraballo was also appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o in 2009. That's a second appointment.\n\nRow 4: Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton is the Chief Justice appointed by Calder\u00f3n.\n\nRow 5: Liana Fiol Matta, again from Calder\u00f3n.\n\nRows 6,7,8,9 all have appointments by Luis Fortu\u00f1o as well. So actually, multiple judges were appointed by Fortu\u00f1o, but since the claim only requires one, it's definitely true.\n\nWait a minute, but I should check if there's any possible issue with the claim. The wording is a bit off\u2014\"1 of the judge be appoint\". It might mean exactly one, which would be false because more than one were appointed by Fortu\u00f1o. So maybe the user intended \"at least one\", making it true.\n\nI think in this context, since the claim uses \"be appoint\" without specifying only one, but says \"1 of the judge\", perhaps meaning at least one, so TRUE is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that one judge was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o. Checking each row, multiple judges were indeed appointed by him, starting with Edgardo Rivera Garcia in Row 2.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine whether the claim \"sila mar\u00eda calder\u00f3n appoint the chief justice\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is saying. The claim states that Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n appointed someone as the Chief Justice. My task is to verify this by checking the relevant information in the given table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are nine rows, each representing a different individual with details about their name, rank, years until retirement, who appointed them, and the year they were appointed.\n\nI need to focus on two main pieces of information for each row: \"rank\" and \"appointed by\". Specifically, I'm looking for any entry where the rank is \"chief justice\" and the person who appointed them is Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n.\n\nLet's go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Anabelle Rodr\u00edguez, associate justice. Appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n in 2004. Since her rank isn't chief justice, this doesn't apply to our claim.\n   \n2. **Row 2**: Edgardo Rivera Garcia, associate justice. Appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o in 2010. Again, not a chief justice.\n\n3. **Row 3**: Erick Kolthoff Caraballo, associate justice. Also appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o in 2009. Not relevant here.\n\n4. **Row 4**: Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton, rank is chief justice. He was appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n in 2004. This seems to match the claim exactly\u2014Sila appointed a chief justice.\n\n5. **Row 5**: Liana Fiol Matta, associate justice. Appointed by Sila in 2004. Not relevant since she's an associate justice.\n\n6. **Row 6**: Luis Estrella Mart\u00ednez, associate justice. Appointed by Fortu\u00f1o in 2011. Doesn't apply.\n\n7. **Row 7**: Mildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco, associate justice. Appointed by Fortu\u00f1o in 2009. Not relevant.\n\n8. **Row 8**: Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres, associate justice. Also appointed by Fortu\u00f1o in 2009.\n\n9. **Row 9**: Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n, associate justice. Appointed by Fortu\u00f1o in 2011.\n\nFrom this review, the only row that mentions a chief justice is Row 4. In that row, it's stated that Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton holds the rank of chief justice and was appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n in 2004. This directly supports the claim made.\n\nNow, considering the years until mandatory retirement for this individual: 0 years, which indicates that he is currently at the point of mandatory retirement or perhaps already retired. However, the claim doesn't specify anything about his current status, only who appointed him as chief justice. Therefore, the appointment itself by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n stands true regardless of his current retirement status.\n\nThus, based on Row 4's information, the claim is fully supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n appointed Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton as the Chief Justice in 2004. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the chief justice be appoint in 2011\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding the table structure and the relevant information.\n\nLooking at the table, there are nine rows, each representing a person with details about their name, rank, years until mandatory retirement, who appointed them, and the year they were appointed. The claim is specifically about the chief justice being appointed in 2011.\n\nFirst, I should identify which row contains the chief justice. Scanning through the ranks, Row 4 has \"federico hern\u00e1ndez denton\" with the rank of \"chief justice.\" So that's the relevant person for this claim.\n\nNext, I need to check when federico hern\u00e1ndez denton was appointed. According to Row 4, he was appointed by \"sila mar\u00eda calder\u00f3n\" in the year 2004. The appointment year is 2004, not 2011. \n\nNow, considering other rows to ensure there's no other chief justice or any confusion. Rows 1-9 list associate justices and one chief justice (Row 4). None of the other entries have the rank \"chief justice,\" so Row 4 is the only relevant one.\n\nThe claim says the chief justice was appointed in 2011, but according to the table, it's 2004. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nTo compile the relevant cells: for Row 4, I need both the \"rank\" and the \"year appointed.\" These are the columns that confirm the position and the appointment year. So the relevant cells are {\"row_index\": 3 (since rows are zero-indexed?), wait no\u2014wait, in the table provided, rows are labeled from Row 1 to Row 9. In programming terms, arrays or lists are typically zero-indexed, but since the user listed them as Row 1-Row 9, I think the indices should be 0 for Row 1, up to 8 for Row 9. Wait no, in the example given, they used row_0. So perhaps the rows are zero-indexed. Let me confirm:\n\nIn the problem statement's example, the JSON has \"row_index\": 0 and 1. But looking back at the table, it starts with Row 1 as anabelle rodr\u00edguez. Wait no, in the provided instruction example, they have row indices starting from 0 for Row 1, which might not be correct. Wait, perhaps I should check again.\n\nWait, actually, in the user's problem statement, under Table (naturalized), it starts with \"Row 1: ...\". So that suggests that rows are numbered starting at 1. But when building the JSON response, row indices should be zero-based? Or is it based on how they presented it?\n\nWait, looking back, no\u2014the example given in the problem uses:\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\":  [ { \"row_0\", ... }, etc. ]\n}\n\nWait, but in their example, it's written as row_0 and row_1, which suggests zero-based indexing. However, the table they provided starts with Row 1: anabelle rodr\u00edguez... So perhaps I need to map Row 1 to index 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user considers the first row as row_index 0. Let me think about how to handle this.\n\nIn programming, when using JSON for such responses, it's common to use zero-based indexing. But in their example, they have rows labeled as Row 1 and Row 2 but refer to them as \"row_0\" and \"row_1\". So I think row_index is zero-based.\n\nTherefore, the first row (Row 1) is index 0, the second (Row 2) is index 1, and so on. So Row 4 would be index 3.\n\nSo for federico hern\u00e1ndez denton, who is in Row 4, which is index 3. The columns are \"rank\" and \"year appointed\".\n\nTherefore, relevant_cells should include row_index: 3 with column names \"rank\" and \"year appointed\".\n\nBut wait, the claim is about the chief justice being appointed in 2011. So I need to check if any row has rank as chief justice and yearappointed as 2011.\n\nLooking at Row 4, it's chief justice, but yearappointed is 2004. All other rows are associate justices, so none have the rank of chief justice except Row 4.\n\nThus, no one was appointed as chief justice in 2011; therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the chief justice was appointed in 2011. Checking the table, only Row 4 has the rank \"chief justice,\" and it shows an appointment year of 2004. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"rank\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year appointed\" }\n   ]\n}\n```",
