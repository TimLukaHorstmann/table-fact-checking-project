    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a table with several rows of data about hockey games, each containing details like date, visitor, score, home team, decision-maker, attendance, and record. The claim is that there was a game on February 25 with a score of 2-1 and another game on February 29 with a score of 3-1.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the table to find any games matching these specific dates and scores. \n\nStarting with February 25: Scanning the 'date' column, I see that row 12 has the date as February 25. The visitor was Pittsburgh, and the score is listed as 2 - 1. That matches exactly what the claim states for this date.\n\nNext, checking February 29: Looking through the dates again, row 13 shows February 29 as the date. The visitor in this case was Los Angeles, and the score is 3 - 1. This also aligns perfectly with the claim's details for that date.\n\nI should ensure there are no other games on these dates or any discrepancies. From what I can see, each date has only one corresponding game entry, so there's no confusion about multiple games on the same day.\n\nThe decision-makers and attendance numbers don't affect this particular claim since it focuses solely on dates and scores. However, noting that both entries have 'favell' as the decision might be an extra detail, but it doesn't impact the truth of the claim.\n\nSince both specified games exist in the table with the exact details mentioned, I can confidently say the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"parent have the decision when the attendance be 3069 in a game on february 14\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It has two main parts: \n1. The decision was made by \"parent\".\n2. The attendance was 3069 on February 14th.\n\nI'll start by looking for the row that corresponds to February 14th in the table. Scanning through each row, I see:\n\n- Row 7 has the date: february 14. So this is the relevant row.\n  \nNext, I need to check two things in this row:\n- The value under the \"decision\" column.\n- The value under the \"attendance\" column.\n\nLooking at Row 7:\n- The decision was made by \"parent\".\n- The attendance was 3069.\n\nBoth parts of the claim match exactly what's in the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, to list the relevant cells that were checked:\n1. Row 7, column \"decision\" confirms who made the decision.\n2.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"the highest score be 3 - 7 in a game against minnesota on february 22 and the lowest be 1 - 1 in a game against pittsburgh on february 21.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. Highest score is 3-7 against Minnesota on February 22.\n2. Lowest score is 1-1 against Pittsburgh on February 21.\n\nI'll start by examining each part separately.\n\n**Part 1: Checking for the highest score of 3-7 on February 22 against Minnesota**\n\nLooking through the table, I need to find the row where the date is February 22 and the visitor is Minnesota. \n\n- Row 11 has the date February 22, with Philadelphia as the home team. The visitor here is Minnesota. The score listed is 3-7 (visitor's score first). So this part of the claim matches the table.\n\n**Part 2: Checking for the lowest score of 1-1 on February 21 against Pittsburgh**\n\nNext, I need to find the row where the date is February 21 and the home team is Pittsburgh. \n\n- Row 10 has the date February 21, with Philadelphia as the visitor. The score is 1-1 (visitor's score first). However, the home team here is Pittsburgh, so this matches the claim.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there are any other scores that might be lower or higher than these in the table to ensure that these are indeed the lowest and highest.\n\nLooking through all the rows:\n\n- Scores listed: 3-3, 3-5, 1-4, 1-4, 2-1, 3-2, 0-4, 1-7, 1-3, 1-1, 3-7, 2-1, 3-1.\n\nThe scores where the visitor's score is first. So for each game:\n\nRow 1: Visitor California vs Home Philadelphia - 3-3 (both teams scored 3)\nRow 2: Chicago at Philadelphia - 3-5\nRow 3: Toronto at Philadelphia - 1-4\nRow 4: Philadelphia at Montreal - 1-4\nRow 5: Philadelphia at St. Louis - 2-1\nRow 6: Philadelphia at Minnesota - 3-2\nRow 7: Philadelphia at California - 0-4\nRow 8: Philadelphia at Los Angeles - 1-7\nRow 9: Philadelphia at New York - 1-3\nRow 10: Philadelphia at Pittsburgh - 1-1 (visitor's score is 1, home's is 1)\nRow 11: Minnesota at Philadelphia - 3-7\nRow 12: Pittsburgh at Philadelphia - 2-1\nRow 13: Los Angeles at Philadelphia - 3-1\n\nNow, looking for the highest and lowest scores. The score in Row 11 is 3-7, which is a total of 10 points (3+7). Is this the highest?\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\n- The highest total score would be the sum of both teams' goals. Let's calculate each game's total:\n\nRow 1: 3+3=6\nRow 2: 3+5=8\nRow 3: 1+4=5\nRow 4: 1+4=5\nRow 5: 2+1=3\nRow 6: 3+2=5\nRow 7: 0+4=4\nRow 8: 1+7=8\nRow 9: 1+3=4\nRow 10: 1+1=2\nRow 11: 3+7=10\nRow 12: 2+1=3\nRow 13: 3+1=4\n\nSo the highest total score is indeed 10 in Row 11 (3-7), which matches the claim.\n\nNow, checking for the lowest score. The claim says the lowest is 1-1 on February 21. \n\nLooking at all scores:\n\nRow 10 has a score of 1-1, total 2 points. Any other lower?\n\nLooking through:\n\nThe lowest total is 2 in Row 10 (1-1). Are there any games with lower than that? No, because the next lowest would be 3, but since Row 10 is 1+1=2, which is indeed the lowest.\n\nHowever, I should check if all the rows are correctly accounted for. \n\nWait, in Row 5: Philadelphia at St. Louis - 2-1 (total 3), which is higher than 2. So yes, Row 10's total of 2 is the lowest.\n\nSo both parts of the claim seem to hold true based on the table.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that the scores are interpreted correctly. In sports like hockey or soccer, sometimes the visitor and home team scores can be misleading. But in this case, the table lists the visitor's score first followed by the home team's score.\n\nSo for Row 11: Visitor Minnesota (3) vs Home Philadelphia (7). So the score is 3-7 in favor of Philadelphia. Similarly, Row 10 is Philadelphia (visitor) 1 vs Pittsburgh (home) 1.\n\nTherefore, both claims are correct based on the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly identifies the highest and lowest scores as per the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"highest_score\": {\n        \"date\": \"February 22\",\n        \"teams\": \"Minnesota at Philadelphia\",\n        \"score\": \"3-7\"\n    },\n    \"lowest_score\": {\n        \"date\": \"February 21\",\n        \"teams\": \"Philadelphia at Pittsburgh\",\n        \"score\": \"1-1\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"highest_score\": true,\n    \"lowest_score\": true\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"there be 2 game against california with the score of 0 - 4 and 3 - 3\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim in detail. It mentions two games against California with specific scores: 0-4 and 3-3. I need to check if both these games exist in the table.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 1 has a score of 3-3 where the visitor is California, playing against Philadelphia at home. So that's one game matching the first score (3-3). \n\nNext, I'll search for another game against California with a different score. Scanning through all rows, Row 7 shows a game on February 14 where Philadelphia is visiting California, and the score is 0-4. That's the second part of the claim.\n\nSo both scores (3-3 and 0-4) are present in the table against California. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there are two games against California with scores of 0-4 and 3-3. Checking the table:\n\n1. **Score 3-3 vs California**: Found in Row 1 (visitor: California).\n2. **Score 0-4 vs California**: Found in Row 7 (home: California).\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the lowest attendance be 3069 when the record go to 25 - 21 - 8 and highest attendance be 15154 when the record go to 25 - 20 - 8.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is referring to. It mentions two specific attendances: 3069 as the lowest and 15154 as the highest. Each of these attendances is linked to a particular record (win-loss-tie). So I have to check if in the table, the attendance 3069 corresponds to the record 25-21-8 and whether 15154 corresponds to 25-20-8.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record. I'll go through each relevant part of the claim step by step.\n\nStarting with the lowest attendance. The claim states it's 3069 when the record is 25-21-8. Let me scan through the 'attendance' column to find where 3069 occurs. \n\nLooking at row indices from 0 to 12 (since there are 13 rows), I check each attendance value:\n- Row 0: 6386\n- Row 1: 14646\n- Row 2: 14646\n- Row 3: 14026\n- Row 4: 13112\n- Row 5: 15154 \u2192 This is the highest attendance mentioned in the claim.\n- Row 6: 3069 \u2192 Here's the lowest attendance.\n\nSo, row index 6 has an attendance of 3069. Now I need to check what the record was on that day. The 'record' column for row 6 shows 25-21-8. That matches exactly with the claim. So this part checks out.\n\nNext, checking the highest attendance which is claimed as 15154 when the record is 25-20-8. From earlier, I noted that row index 5 has an attendance of 15154. Let's look at its record: row 5 shows a record of 25-20-8, which also matches the claim.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that these are indeed the lowest and highest attendances in the entire table. So let me confirm if there are any other attendances lower than 3069 or higher than 15154.\n\nLooking through all the attendance numbers:\n- Row 0: 6386\n- Row 1: 14646\n- Row 2: 14646\n- Row 3: 14026\n- Row 4: 13112\n- Row 5: 15154 (highest so far)\n- Row 6: 3069 (lowest so far)\n- Row 7: 9867\n- Row 8: 17250 \u2192 Wait, this is higher than 15154? Let me check. 17250 is indeed higher than 15154.\n\nHold on, that's a problem because the claim says the highest attendance is 15154, but in row 8 (index 8), the attendance is 17250, which is even higher. So this means the claim might be incorrect regarding the highest attendance.\n\nWait, let me double-check row indices to avoid confusion:\n- Row 6: February 14 \u2192 attendance 3069, record 25-21-8\n- Row 5: February 11 \u2192 attendance 15154, record 25-20-8\n- Row 8: February 18 \u2192 attendance 17250, but let's check its record. The 'record' for row 8 is 25-23-8.\n\nSo the claim says that the highest attendance (15154) corresponds to a record of 25-20-8, which it does in row 5. However, there's another attendance higher than 15154 (row 8 with 17250), but this doesn't conflict with the claim because the claim only specifies that 15154 is when the record was 25-20-8, not necessarily the overall highest. But wait, does the claim imply that 15154 is the absolute highest attendance? Because in row 8, there's a higher attendance of 17250.\n\nSo the problem arises: if the claim states that 15154 is the highest attendance when the record was 25-20-8, but in reality, there's a higher attendance elsewhere, does that affect the validity of the claim? Because the claim might be implying that 15154 is the maximum overall, which it isn't because row 8 has a higher number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. The claim could be saying that when the record was 25-20-8, the attendance was 15154, and this is the highest for that particular record, not necessarily the overall highest. But in reality, row 8 has a higher attendance but a different record.\n\nSo let's clarify: The claim mentions two specific attendances tied to specific records. It doesn't explicitly state whether these are the absolute highs or lows, just that those attendances correspond to those records. However, the way it's phrased could imply that 3069 is the lowest attendance across all games and 15154 is the highest.\n\nGiven that row 8 has an attendance of 17250, which is higher than 15154, if the claim is asserting that 15154 is the overall maximum, then it's incorrect. But if it's just saying that when the record was 25-20-8, attendance was 15154 (which is correct), and similarly for 3069 with 25-21-8, but without implying these are the overall maxima or minima, then perhaps the claim is partially correct.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the exact wording: \"the lowest attendance be 3069 when the record go to 25 - 21 - 8 and highest attendance be 15154 when the record go to 25 - 20 - 8.\" The use of 'be' could imply that these are the respective minima and maxima. So if there's a higher attendance elsewhere, then the claim is incorrect in stating that 15154 is the highest.\n\nSo, since row 8 has an attendance of 17250, which is higher than 15154, the claim's assertion that 15154 is the highest is false. Therefore, the entire claim is incorrect because while the attendance at 3069 does correspond to record 25-21-8 and 15154 corresponds to 25-20-8, the latter isn't the overall highest.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting row indices. Let me recount:\n\nRows are from 0 to 12 (since there are 13 rows):\n\nRow 0: Feb 1 \u2192 attendance 6386\nRow 1: Feb 2 \u2192 14646\nRow 2: Feb 3 \u2192 14646\nRow 3: Feb 4 \u2192 14026\nRow 4: Feb 5 \u2192 13112\nRow 5: Feb 6 \u2192 15154 (highest so far)\nRow 6: Feb 7 \u2192 3069 (lowest so far)\nRow 7: Feb 8 \u2192 9867\nRow 8: Feb 9 \u2192 17250 \u2192 Oh, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the dates correctly.\n\nWait, no, the rows are as per their order in the table provided. So row 8 is indeed the one with attendance 17250 on February 18, which has a record of 25-23-8. Therefore, this is higher than the claimed highest of 15154.\n\nSo, to sum up:\n\n- The claim says lowest attendance (3069) occurs when record is 25-21-8: Correct (row 6).\n- The claim says highest attendance (15154) occurs when record is 25-20-8: Correct for that specific instance, but there's a higher attendance elsewhere (17250), so the overall highest isn't 15154.\n\nTherefore, if the claim implies that these are the absolute min and max attendances across all games, it's incorrect because of the higher attendance in row 8. However, if it's just stating that those attendances occurred at those records without implying they're the extremes, then only part is correct.\n\nBut given the wording \"lowest... be\" and \"highest... be,\" it seems to imply that these are the respective minimum and maximum attendances overall. Since there's a higher attendance elsewhere, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe task was to verify if the lowest attendance of 3069 occurred when the record was 25-21-8 and if the highest attendance of 15154 occurred when the record was 25-20-8. \n\nUpon examination:\n- The attendance of 3069 corresponds to a record of 25-21-8 (correct).\n- However, while the attendance of 15154 does correspond to a record of 25-20-8, there is a higher attendance of 17250 recorded on another date with a different record. \n\nThus, the claim that 15154 is the highest overall attendance is incorrect because a higher attendance exists.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is partially correct; while 3069 and 15154 are attendances for their respective records, 15154 is not the highest overall. \n\n\\boxed{\\text{The claim is partially correct.}}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"parent have the decision when the attendance be 9867 in a game on february 14.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. **Decision Maker**: The person making the decision is \"parent.\"\n2. **Attendance**: The attendance at that game was 9867.\n3. **Date of Game**: February 14.\n\nI'll look through each row in the table to find a match for these conditions.\n\nStarting with Row 1: It's from February 1, not the 14th. So I can skip this.\n\nRow 2 is February 3rd; still not matching. Moving on.\n\nRow 3 is February 4th\u2014nope.\n\nRow 4: February 7th\u2014doesn't fit either.\n\nLooking at Row 5: It's February 10th, which isn't the date we're interested in.\n\nRow 6: February 11th\u2014still not matching.\n\nRow 7: This is from February 14th. Now, let me check the attendance here. The attendance for this row is 3069. That's much lower than 9867. Also, who made the decision? It says \"parent\" in the decision column. So while the date and decision maker match, the attendance does not.\n\nContinuing to Row 8: February 16th\u2014doesn't fit. The attendance here is 9867, which matches the claim's attendance figure. However, the date isn't February 14, so this row doesn't satisfy all conditions.\n\nRow 9: February 18th\u2014nope.\n\nRow 10: February 21st\u2014doesn't match either.\n\nRows 11 to 13 are after February 14, so they don't apply here.\n\nSo, from my analysis:\n\n- The attendance of 9867 occurs on February 16 (Row 8), but the decision was made by \"parent.\"\n- On February 14 (Row 7), the attendance was 3069, not 9867, even though the decision was by \"parent.\"\n\nTherefore, there's no row where all three conditions are met: parent as the decision maker, attendance of 9867, and date being February 14. The claim is false because the attendance on February 14 wasn't 9867, and the game with 9867 attendance was on a different date.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states two things: \n\n1. The highest score was 2-7 in a game against Minnesota on February 22.\n2. The lowest score was 1-1 in a game against Pittsburgh on February 21.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row to find the relevant games mentioned in the claim and check their scores.\n\nStarting with February 22: Looking at Row 11, it shows that Philadelphia hosted Minnesota on February 22. The score was 3-7. Wait a minute, the visitor is Minnesota with a score of 3, and the home team Philadelphia scored 7? No, actually, looking again, the visitor's score comes first in the format 'visitor - home'. So it's 3 (Minnesota) vs. 7 (Philadelphia). That makes the score 3-7 for that game.\n\nBut the claim says the highest score was 2-7. Hmm, that doesn't match because the actual score is 3-7. Also, looking through all rows, let me check if there's a game with 2-7 as the score. Scanning each row:\n\nRow 1: 3-3\nRow 2: 3-5\nRow 3: 1-4\nRow 4: 1-4\nRow 5: 2-1\nRow 6: 3-2\nRow 7: 0-4\nRow 8: 1-7\nRow 9: 1-3\nRow 10: 1-1\nRow 11: 3-7 (visitorMinnesota)\nRow 12: 2-1\nRow 13: 3-1\n\nI don't see a game with the score 2-7. The closest is Row 8 where Philadelphia lost to Los Angeles with a score of 1-7, but that's not against Minnesota.\n\nNext, checking February 21: The claim mentions a game against Pittsburgh on that date with a score of 1-1. Looking at Row 10, the date is February 21, visitor is Philadelphia, home is Pittsburgh, and the score is 1-1. So that part is correct.\n\nBut since the first part about the highest score being 2-7 in a game against Minnesota on February 22 isn't accurate (the actual score was 3-7), the claim has an error. Therefore, the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states two points: a high score of 2-7 against Minnesota on Feb 22 and a low of 1-1 vs. Pittsburgh on Feb 21. Checking the table:\n\n- **Feb 22 (Row 11)**: Game against Minnesota, score was 3-7, not 2-7.\n- **Feb 21 (Row 10)**: Game against Pittsburgh, score was 1-1.\n\nSince the highest score mentioned in the claim doesn't match, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says two things: first, that the lowest attendance was 9115 when the record was 25-21-8, and second, that the highest attendance was 15154 when the record was 25-20-8.\n\nLet me start by looking at each part of the claim one by one. \n\nFirst, the lowest attendance. I'll go through each row in the table and check the attendance numbers. Let's list them out:\n\nRow 1: 6386\nRow 2: 14646\nRow 3: 14646\nRow 4: 14026\nRow 5: 13112\nRow 6: 15154\nRow 7: 3069\nRow 8: 9867\nRow 9: 17250\nRow 10: 9198\nRow 11: 14392\nRow 12: 14418\nRow 13: 9115\n\nLooking at these numbers, the smallest attendance is 3069 in row 7, but wait, that's lower than 9115. So the claim says the lowest attendance was 9115. But in reality, it's actually 3069 on February 14 against California. Therefore, the first part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nNow, checking the second part about the highest attendance. The highest number I see is 17250 in row 9. So according to that, the highest was 17250 when the record was 25-23-8, not 25-20-8 as claimed.\n\nWait, but the claim says the highest attendance is 15154 when the record was 25-20-8. Let me check which row has 15154. That's row 6: February 11 against Minnesota. The record there is indeed 25-20-8, so that part of the claim about the attendance and record being 25-20-8 is correct.\n\nBut wait, the overall highest attendance is actually higher than 15154\u2014it's 17250 in row 9. So the claim says the highest was 15154 when the record was 25-20-8, but that's not the actual highest; there's a higher attendance later on.\n\nAlso, regarding the lowest attendance: the claim states it was 9115 when the record was 25-21-8. Let me check which row has attendance 9115. That's row 13: February 29 against Los Angeles. The record there is 26-25-9, not 25-21-8 as the claim says.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are incorrect. The lowest attendance was actually lower (3069) and occurred when the record was different. Similarly, the highest attendance was higher than 15154 and also occurred at a different record point.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"there be 2 game against california with the score of 0 - 2 and 2 - 3\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the table carefully. The table has multiple rows, each representing a different game. Each row includes details like date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record. My focus is on games against California, so I need to look for entries where either the visitor or the home team is California.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Visitor is California, Home is Philadelphia. Score is 3 - 3.\n- Row 2: Visitor is Chicago, Home is Philadelphia. Not relevant.\n- Row 3: Visitor is Toronto, Home is Philadelphia. Not relevant.\n- Row 4: Visitor is Philadelphia, Home is Montreal. Not relevant.\n- Row 5: Visitor is Philadelphia, Home is St Louis. Not relevant.\n- Row 6: Visitor is Philadelphia, Home is Minnesota. Not relevant.\n- Row 7: Visitor is Philadelphia, Home is California. Score is 0 - 4.\n- Rows 8 to 13 don't have California as either visitor or home.\n\nSo, the games against California are in Row 1 and Row 7. Now, let's check their scores:\n\nRow 1: The score is 3 - 3 (California vs Philadelphia).\nRow 7: The score is 0 - 4 (Philadelphia vs California).\n\nThe claim mentions two games with scores 0-2 and 2-3. Let's see if these scores exist.\n\nLooking at the scores in the relevant rows:\n- Row 1: 3-3\n- Row 7: 0-4\n\nNeither of these matches 0-2 or 2-3. So, there are no games where California scored 0 against 2 or 2 against 3. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data in the table.\n\nSo, I should mark this as FALSE and list the relevant cells which are Rows 1 and 7 with their respective scores.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states two games against California with specific scores, but the table shows only one game each where California was involved, both with different scores. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
