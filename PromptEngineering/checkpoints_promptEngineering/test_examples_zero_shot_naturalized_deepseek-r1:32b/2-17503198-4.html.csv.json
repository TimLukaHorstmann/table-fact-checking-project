    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"bate borisov score 2 goal more in match against anderlecht as compare to the match against levski sofia\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It states that Bate Borisov scored two goals more against Anderlecht than they did against Levski Sofia.\n\nI'll start by looking for matches involving Bate Borisov against both Anderlecht and Levski Sofia in the table.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 9: Round is second qualifying round. Team 1 is Anderlecht, Team 2 is Bate Borisov. The aggregate score is 3-4. So Bate scored 4 goals here.\n- Row 10: Round is third qualifying round. Team 1 is Levski Sofia, Team 2 is Bate Borisov. Aggregate score is 1-2. So Bate scored 2 goals here.\n\nNow, comparing the two matches:\n\nAgainst Anderlecht: Bate scored 4 goals.\nAgainst Levski Sofia: Bate scored 2 goals.\n\nThe difference is 4 - 2 = 2 goals. Therefore, Bate Borisov scored exactly 2 more goals against Anderlecht than against Levski Sofia.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\n- For the match against Anderlecht (Row 9), we need the 'agg' and possibly both legs to confirm total goals.\n- For the match against Levski Sofia (Row 10), similarly, 'agg' would suffice but checking legs doesn't change the aggregate.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are Row 9's 'agg', Row 9's team 2, Row 10's 'agg', and Row 10's team 2.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's see. I need to determine whether the claim \"bate borisov play as team 2 against juventus in the group stage\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row of the table and look for instances where Bate Borisov is involved as either Team 1 or Team 2. The claim specifies that Bate Borisov is playing as Team 2 against Juventus in the group stage.\n\nLooking at Row 8: It's about Bate Borisov in the first qualifying round, but it doesn't involve Juventus. So this isn't relevant.\n\nRow 9: Anderlecht vs. Bate Borisov in the second qualifying round. Again, not related to Juventus or the group stage.\n\nRow 10: Levski Sofia vs. Bate Borisov in the third qualifying round. Still no mention of Juventus.\n\nNow, looking at Row 12: It's under the group stage, which is what the claim mentions. The teams here are Bate Borisov as Team 1 and Juventus as Team 2. But wait, the claim says Bate Borisov is Team 2. In this row, they're Team 1.\n\nHmm, so according to the table, in the group stage, Bate Borisov was Team 1 against Juventus. The claim says they were Team 2. That's a discrepancy.\n\nIs there another row where Bate Borisov plays as Team 2 against Juventus? Let me check Rows 1 through 13 again.\n\nRow 11: Real Madrid vs. Bate Borisov in the group stage, so here Bate is Team 2. But it's against Real Madrid, not Juventus.\n\nRows 1 to 13 don't show any instance where Bate Borisov is Team 2 against Juventus in the group stage. The only group stage match involving Bate Borisov as a team is when they're Team 1 against Juventus (Row 12) and Team 2 against Real Madrid (Row 11). There's no entry where they are Team 2 against Juventus.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by the table. It should be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Bate Borisov played as Team 2 against Juventus in the group stage. Checking the relevant row in the table:\n\n- **Row 12**: Under the group stage, Bate Borisov is listed as Team 1 facing off against Juventus.\n\nSince the table shows Bate Borisov as Team 1 and not Team 2 against Juventus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It states that Shakhtior Soligorsk scored the highest number of goals, which is 5, in the first round of the 2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup. So I need to check if this is accurate according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\n- Each row has columns: round, team1, agg, team2, 1st leg, 2nd leg.\n- The rows are indexed from 0 (Row 1) to 12 (Row 13).\n\nI'll start by identifying the relevant rows. The claim mentions \"first round of 2008 uefa intertoto cup.\" Looking through the table:\n\n- Row 1 is about the 2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup but seems like a header or placeholder since all entries are the same as the round name.\n- Row 2: Round is first round, team1 is Cracovia, agg is 1 - 5, team2 is Shakhtior Soligorsk. The 1st leg was 1-2 and 2nd leg 0-3.\n\nSo in this row (Row 2), the aggregate score is 1 - 5. This indicates that Team1 scored 1 goal total across both legs, and Team2 (Shakhtior Soligorsk) scored 5 goals.\n\nThe claim states that Shakhtior Soligorsk scored the highest of 5 in this round. From Row 2, team2 is indeed Shakhtior Soligorsk with an aggregate score of 5, which seems to be correct.\n\nAre there other rows that mention the first round of the 2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup? Let's check:\n\n- Rows 3 to 13 don't have \"first round\" except Row 9 mentions second qualifying round and others refer to different tournaments like UEFA Cup, Champions League, etc. So only Row 2 is relevant for this specific claim.\n\nTherefore, the information in Row 2 supports that Shakhtior Soligorsk scored 5 goals in the first round of the 2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team2\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"there be only 1 match in the 2008 belarusian premier league with the agg of 4 - 1\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is referring to. The claim mentions two things: \n\n1. There's only one match in the 2008 Belarusian Premier League.\n2. That match has an aggregate score (agg) of 4-1.\n\nSo, my task is to look through the table and see if there's exactly one such match with those specifics.\n\nLooking at the table structure provided, it seems each row represents a different round or stage of some competition, possibly the Belarusian Premier League. The columns are \"round,\" \"team 1,\" \"agg,\" \"team 2,\" \"1st leg,\" and \"2nd leg.\" \n\nI'll go through each row to see if any mention the 2008 Belarusian Premier League. Let's start:\n\n- Row 1: Talks about the 2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup, not the Premier League.\n- Row 2: First round of some competition between Cracovia and Shakhtyor Soligorsk. Doesn't mention the Premier League.\n- Row 3: Second round between Sturm Graz and Shakhtyor Soligorsk again, no Premier League here.\n- Row 4: Refers to the 2008-09 UEFA Cup; not relevant.\n- Row 5: First qualifying round with Legia Warszawa vs. Gomel. Hmm, Gomel is a Belarusian team, but does this qualify as the Premier League? I'm not sure yet. The agg score here is 4-1 in favor of Legia Warszawa over Gomel.\n- Row 6: First qualifying round between MTZ-Ryppon Minsk and Zilina. MTZ is a Belarusian team, but again, not sure if this is the Premier League.\n- Row 7: 2008-09 UEFA Champions League; irrelevant to Belarusian Premier League.\n- Rows 8-13: Various rounds involving Bate Borisov, Anderlecht, Valur, Levski Sofia, Real Madrid, Juventus, Zenit St. Petersburg. These include teams from different leagues and competitions.\n\nNow, focusing on the claim's two points:\n\n1. Only one match in the 2008 Belarusian Premier League: I'm not sure if these are all matches within the Premier League or if they're qualifying rounds for other European competitions. The table doesn't explicitly state it's the Premier League; instead, it seems to be various competitions involving teams from different countries.\n\n2. Aggregate score of 4-1: Looking through the agg column, I see Row 5 has an agg of 4-1 (Legia Warszawa vs Gomel). Are there any other rows with a 4-1 aggregate? Let me check:\n\nRows:\n- Row 2: 1-5\n- Row 3: 2-0\n- Row 5: 4-1\n- Others have different scores.\n\nSo, only one match has an agg of 4-1. But is that match part of the Belarusian Premier League? The table doesn't specify the league; it just lists matches in various competitions. So unless I can confirm that these are indeedPremier League matches, I might be off track.\n\nWait, but the user's claim specifies \"2008 belarusian premier league.\" If the table is about the Premier League, then Row 5 would be the only match with a 4-1 agg. However, if the table includes other competitions, then maybe there are more such matches elsewhere not shown here.\n\nBut based solely on this table, within its data, only Row 5 has a 4-1 aggregate. So, according to the claim, if that's the only one in the Premier League, it would be TRUE. However, since the table doesn't explicitly state these are Premier League matches, I can't be certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all these matches are part of the Belarusian Premier League. If so, then there is indeed only one with a 4-1 agg (Row 5). But without explicit mention, it's ambiguous.\n\nWait, another angle: The user might have confused the competition. Maybe the table includes matches from other competitions, but the claim refers to the Premier League, which may not be represented here. Or perhaps all these are part of the Premier League rounds or qualifiers.\n\nThis is a bit tricky because without knowing the context of each row's competition, it's hard to say for sure. However, given that the user specified \"2008 belarusian premier league,\" and if none of these rows explicitly mention it, then maybe there are zero such matches in the table. Alternatively, perhaps some of them are.\n\nWait, looking back at Row 5: Legia Warszawa is a Polish team, Gomel is Belarusian. So this might be an international match, not necessarily part of the Premier League.\n\nSimilarly, MTZ-Ryppon Minsk (Row 6) is a Belarusian team playing against Zilina from Slovakia. Again, possibly a qualifier for another competition.\n\nGiven that, perhaps none of these rows are actually from the Belarusian Premier League but rather European qualifiers or other competitions. Therefore, if there's no row explicitly mentioning the Premier League and only one with 4-1 agg in some competition, the claim could be TRUE only if that single match is indeed part of the Premier League.\n\nBut since the table doesn't specify that, I might have to assume based on the teams involved. Gomel is a Belarusian club, so maybe Row 5 is a domestic match. If it's within the same league, then yes, but again, without explicit info, it's uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all these matches are in the Premier League, and thus only one has the 4-1 agg. Therefore, the answer would be TRUE.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe there's another row with a 4-1 agg that I missed? Let me check again:\n\nLooking through each row's agg column:\n- Row 2: 1-5\n- Row 3: 2-0\n- Row 5: 4-1\n- Rows beyond that have different scores.\n\nSo, only one instance of 4-1 in the entire table. So if that is within the Premier League as per the user's claim, then TRUE; otherwise, FALSE.\n\nBut the problem is whether these are indeed Premier League matches. The rows mention various competitions like Intertoto Cup, Champions League, etc., but not necessarily the Premier League.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'round' column refers to the stage within the Premier League? For example, first round, second round, etc. If that's the case, then all these are part of the league stages.\n\nIf so, then Row 5 would be a match in the Premier League with an agg of 4-1, and there's only one such match in the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE, as it's the only one with that score.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake, and the competition isn't the Premier League but another league or cup. But based on the given data, I have to work with what's here.\n\nIn conclusion, assuming that all these matches are part of the Belarusian Premier League, then there is only one match with an aggregate score of 4-1 (Row 5). Therefore, the answer would be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n   ]\n}",

It mentions Valur losing in the first qualifying round of the 2008-09 UEFA Champions League. So I need to find any rows that pertain to the first qualifying round and involve Valur as a team.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: This seems to be a header or placeholder row since all columns have the same value, \"2008 uefa intertoto cup.\" Probably not relevant here.\n\nRow 5: It's about the first qualifying round between Legia Warszawa and Gomel. Valur isn't involved here.\n\nRow 6: First qualifying round between MTZ-Ripo Minsk and \u017dilina. Still no mention of Valur.\n\nRow 8: This is where I find Valur. The row says it's the first qualifying round, team1 is BATE Borisov with agg score 3-0 over Valur (team2). So in this match, Valur lost both legs: 0-2 and 0-1.\n\nNow, checking if this is part of the UEFA Champions League. The row under 'round' says \"first qualifying round,\" but I need to confirm which competition it's for. Looking at other rows, like Row 4 and Row 7, they mention the UEFA Cup and Champions League with the same season (2008-09). However, this specific first qualifying round in row 8 doesn't explicitly state it's for the Champions League\u2014it just says \"first qualifying round.\" \n\nWait, but I should check if the rounds are part of the Champions League. The first qualifying rounds can be for different competitions, so without explicit mention, it's unclear. However, since Valur is a team that might participate in the Champions League qualifiers, and given the structure of the table, row 8 is likely part of the Champions League process.\n\nAdditionally, looking at other rows like Row 10 and 11, they involve BATE Borisov progressing further into group stages against teams like Real Madrid and Juventus, which are part of the Champions League. This suggests that the earlier qualifying rounds (like in row 8) were for the Champions League.\n\nTherefore, Valur did lose the first qualifying round of the 2008-09 UEFA Champions League.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as Valur lost to BATE Borisov in the first qualifying round.

I need to determine whether the claim \"there be at least 3 match in the 2008 belarusian premier league with an agg of 4 - 1\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the table structure. It looks like each row represents a different round or stage in some football competitions, such as the UEFA Intertoto Cup, UEFA Cup, and others. The columns include \"round,\" \"team 1,\" \"agg\" (which likely stands for aggregate score), \"team 2,\" \"1st leg,\" and \"2nd leg.\" \n\nThe claim mentions three matches in the 2008 Belarusian Premier League with an aggregate score of 4-1. So, I need to check if there are at least three entries in the table that correspond to this league and have an agg of 4-1.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: This seems to be a header or title for the 2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup, not related to the Belarusian Premier League. So, I can skip this row.\n\nRow 2: It's about the first round between Cracovia and Shakhtyor Soligorsk with an aggregate score of 1-5. The teams don't seem to be from the Belarusian Premier League, so probably not relevant.\n\nRow 3: Second round between Sturm Graz and Shakhtyor Soligorsk with a 2-0 aggregate. Again, not related to the Belarusian Premier League.\n\nRow 4: This looks like another header or title for the 2008-09 UEFA Cup. Not relevant here.\n\nRows 5 and 6: Both are first qualifying rounds of different competitions. Row 5 is between Legia Warszawa (Polish team) and Gomel (Belarusian), with an agg of 4-1. That's one match that fits the agg of 4-1, but I need to see if it's in the Belarusian Premier League. However, Legia Warszawa is from Poland, so maybe not a domestic league match.\n\nRow 6: MTZ-Ripo Minsk vs. \u017dilina (Slovakia) with an agg of 2-3. Not relevant as well.\n\nRows 7 and 8: Similar to rows 4 and others, they are headers or qualifying rounds in other competitions.\n\nRow 9: Second qualifying round between Anderlecht (Belgium) and Bate Borisov (Belarus). The aggregate is 3-4. Close, but not exactly 4-1.\n\nRow 10: Third qualifying round between Levski Sofia (Bulgaria) and Bate Borisov with an agg of 1-2. Not matching the 4-1 score.\n\nRows 11-13: These are group stages in the UEFA Champions League, involving teams like Real Madrid, Juventus, Zenit St Petersburg, and Bate Borisov. The aggregates here don't include a 4-1 score either.\n\nNow, focusing on rows that mention Belarusian Premier League. From what I see, row 5 mentions Gomel, which is a Belarusian team, but the opponent is Legia Warszawa from Poland, so it's an international match, not a domestic league game.\n\nLooking back at all the rows, none of them are specifically labeled as part of the 2008 Belarusian Premier League. The table seems to cover various UEFA competitions and qualifying rounds rather than domestic leagues. Therefore, there aren't any matches listed from the Belarusian Premier League in this table, let alone three with an aggregate score of 4-1.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, I don't find evidence supporting that there are at least three such matches in the 2008 Belarusian Premier League.

The claim states: \"In the first round of 2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup, Shakhtyor Soligorsk be eliminate and score no goal.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is asserting. There are two main points here:\n1. Shakhtyor Soligorsk was eliminated in the first round.\n2. They scored no goals in that round.\n\nLooking at the table, I should find the row that corresponds to the \"first round\" of the \"2008 uefa intertoto cup.\" Scanning through the rows, Row 2 is labeled as the first round for the 2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup. Let's examine this row closely.\n\nIn Row 2:\n- Team 1: Cracovia\n- Team 2: Shakhtyor Soligorsk\n- Aggregate (agg): 1 - 5\n- 1st leg score: 1 - 2\n- 2nd leg score: 0 - 3\n\nFrom the aggregate score of 1-5, it's clear that Cracovia scored a total of 1 goal, while Shakhtyor Soligorsk scored 5 goals. This means Shakhtyor actually won this round with a higher score, so they weren't eliminated here; instead, they advanced.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the goals scored by Shakhtyor in each leg:\n- In the first leg, they scored 2 goals.\n- In the second leg, they scored another 3 goals.\nSo, altogether, they scored 5 goals across both legs. This directly contradicts the claim that they scored no goals.\n\nMoreover, being eliminated would mean that their aggregate score was lower than Cracovia's, but since Shakhtyor has a higher score (5-1), they weren't eliminated in this round.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect: Shakhtyor wasn't eliminated, and they did score multiple goals.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Shakhtyor Soligorsk won the first round by scoring five goals and was not eliminated.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Bate Borisov's performance against Anderlecht and Levski Sofia is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the claim first.\n\nThe claim states: \"Bate Borisov do not score any goal against Anderlecht, but score 4 more when competing against Levski Sofia.\" So, two parts here:\n\n1. Bate Borisov didn't score any goals against Anderlecht.\n2. They scored 4 goals against Levski Sofia.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table to find the relevant rows where Bate Borisov is involved in matches against these teams.\n\nLooking through the table, let's identify each match involving Bate Borisov:\n\n- Row 8: First qualifying round, Bate Borisov vs Valur. Here, they scored 3 goals in total (2 in first leg and 1 in second). Not relevant for our claim.\n  \n- Row 9: Second qualifying round, Anderlecht vs Bate Borisov. The aggregate is 3 - 4, so that means Anderlecht scored 3, Bate Borisov scored 4? Wait, no. Let me check the columns correctly.\n\nWait, in row 9, team1 is Anderlecht and team2 is Bate Borisov. The 'agg' column shows 3 - 4. So that means Anderlecht's total is 3, Bate Borisov's total is 4? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, no. In football matches, the aggregate score is typically team1 vs team2. So in row 9: agg is 3 - 4, meaning Anderlecht scored 3 and Bate Borisov scored 4. But wait, that can't be right because in the legs, first leg was 1-2 (Anderlecht 1, Bate 2), second leg 2-2 (Anderlecht 2, Bate 2). So total for Anderlecht is 3 and Bate is 4. Wait no: team1 is Anderlecht, so in first leg, they scored 1, Bate 2; in second leg, Anderlecht 2, Bate 2. So overall, Anderlecht has 3 (1+2), Bate Borisov has 4 (2+2). But wait, the aggregate is listed as 3-4 for team1 and team2 respectively. Wait no: in row 9, team1 is Anderlecht, team2 is Bate. The agg column shows 3 - 4. So that would mean Anderlecht scored 3 goals total, Bate Borisov scored 4? That doesn't make sense because the legs are first leg 1-2 (Anderlecht 1, Bate 2) and second leg 2-2 (Anderlecht 2, Bate 2). So Anderlecht's total is 3 goals (1+2), Bate Borisov's total is 4 goals (2+2). Therefore, the aggregate score is 3 - 4 in favor of Bate Borisov. So in this match against Anderlecht, Bate scored 4 goals.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"do not score any goal against Anderlecht.\" But according to this, they scored 4. That would make the first part false. However, let me double-check if I'm reading it correctly.\n\nLooking at row 9:\n\n- Round: second qualifying round\n- team1: anderlecht\n- team2: bate borisov\n- agg: 3 - 4 (so team1 scored 3, team2 scored 4)\n- 1st leg: 1 - 2 (Anderlecht 1, Bate 2)\n- 2nd leg: 2 - 2 (Anderlecht 2, Bate 2)\n\nSo yes, Bate Borisov scored a total of 4 goals against Anderlecht. Therefore, the first part of the claim is false.\n\nNow, checking the second part: scoring 4 goals against Levski Sofia.\n\nLooking through the table for matches involving Levski Sofia and Bate Borisov.\n\nI see row 10:\n\n- Round: Third qualifying round\n- team1: Dinamo Zagreb\n- team2: Bate Borisov\n- agg: 5 - 3 (so Dinamo scored 5, Bate scored 3)\n- Legs: first leg 2-1, second leg 3-2\n\nWait, but where is the match against Levski Sofia?\n\nLooking again, perhaps I missed it. Let me check all rows:\n\nRows are from index 0 to 10.\n\nRow 8: Bate vs Valur\nRow 9: Anderlecht vs Bate\nRow 10: Dinamo Zagreb vs Bate\n\nNo row shows a match between Bate Borisov and Levski Sofia. So according to the table, there is no data about Bate Borisov playing against Levski Sofia.\n\nTherefore, the second part of the claim can't be verified because there's no such match in the provided table. Since the claim states they scored 4 goals against Levski Sofia, but we have no information on that, it might not be supported.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check again. Is there any other row where Bate Borisov is involved?\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\nRow 8: Bate vs Valur\nRow 9: Anderlecht vs Bate\nRow 10: Dinamo Zagreb vs Bate\n\nNo Levski Sofia in any of these. So the claim's second part isn't supported by the table.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. The claim is about two specific matches: against Anderlecht and Levski Sofia. From the table, we have data on their match against Anderlecht (row 9) where Bate scored 4 goals. So the first part of the claim that they didn't score any goal is false because they did score 4.\n\nThe second part says they scored 4 more when competing against Levski Sofia. Since there's no data on a match between Bate and Levski in the table, we can't confirm this. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the table because one part is false (scoring goals against Anderlecht) and the other is unverified.\n\nSo, putting it together: The first part of the claim is false, so regardless of the second part, the overall answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are from row 9 where Bate Borisov played against Anderlecht. They scored 4 goals in total (2 in each leg). Since they did score against Anderlecht, the claim's first assertion is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n     {\"row_1st_leg\": 9, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n     {\"row_2nd_leg\": 9, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"In the first qualifying round of the 2008-09 UEFA Champions League, Valur was able to win and then proceed to 3 more qualifying rounds.\"\n\nWait a minute, I notice that in the table, one of the teams is spelled as \"valur\" (all lowercase) while the claim uses \"Valur.\" I should consider if these are the same. Since it's just a difference in capitalization, I can assume they refer to the same team.\n\nNext, I'll look through the table to find any mention of Valur in the first qualifying round of the 2008-09 UEFA Champions League. \n\nLooking at Row 5: It mentions the \"first qualifying round\" for Legia Warszawa against Gomel. Not Valur here.\n\nRow 6 is also about the \"first qualifying round,\" but it's between MTZ-RIPo Minsk and \u017dilina. Again, no Valur.\n\nRow 8 has \"first qualifying round\" with team Bate Borisov vs Valur. The aggregate score is 3-0 in favor of Bate Borisov. So Valur lost this match.\n\nNow, the claim says Valur won and proceeded to three more rounds. But according to Row 8, Valur lost the first qualifying round. Therefore, they wouldn't have moved on to subsequent rounds.\n\nAdditionally, looking further down the table, I don't see any entries where Valur participated in later qualifying rounds beyond the first. All their appearances are limited to this initial loss.\n\nSo, since Valur didn't win and proceed, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
