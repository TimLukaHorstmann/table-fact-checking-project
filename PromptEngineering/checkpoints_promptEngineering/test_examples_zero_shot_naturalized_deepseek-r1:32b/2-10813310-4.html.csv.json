    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"at the venue the stoop, the score be 24 - 28\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that at a game held at the venue called \"the stoop,\" the score was 24-28. So I'm looking for a row where the venue is \"the stoop\" and checking if the score matches 24-28.\n\nLooking through the table, each row has a venue column. I'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Venue is odsal stadium \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 2: Boundary park \u2013 nope.\nRow 3: The jungle \u2013 no.\nRow 4: Odsal stadium again.\nRow 5: Central park.\nRow 6: Stade S\u00e9bastien Charl\u00e9ty \u2013 not the stoop.\nRow 7: Odsal.\nRow 8: Odsal.\nRow 9: Odsal.\nRow 10: Wilderspool.\nRow 11: Odsal.\nRow 12: Thrum hall.\nRow 13: The willows.\nRow 14: Headingley.\nRow 15: Odsal.\nRow 16: Knowsley road.\nRow 17: Odsal.\nRow 18: Odsal.\nRow 19: Don valley stadium.\nRow 20: Odsal.\nRow 21: Odsal, but result is L. Score is 18-33.\nRow 22: Venue is the stoop! So this is the relevant row.\n\nIn row 22 (which would be index 21 if starting from 0), venue is the stoop. Now checking the score: it's 24 - 28, which matches the claim. The result was L, but the claim doesn't specify win or loss, just the score, so that's fine.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as the relevant row (row 21) at venue \"the stoop\" has a score of 24-28.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine if the claim \"mcnamara score 3/4 goal when the venue be the stoop\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n1. Player: mcnamara\n2. Goals scored: 3 goals out of 4 attempts (3/4)\n3. Venue: the stoop\n\nNow, I need to check each row in the table for a match with these criteria.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Row 22 has the venue as \"the stoop\" and shows mcnamara scoring 4/4 goals. This doesn't match the claim of 3/4.\n  \nI don't see any other entries where mcnamara scored exactly 3/4 at \"the stoop\". All other rows either have different venues or different goal statistics.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by the data in the table. The answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
