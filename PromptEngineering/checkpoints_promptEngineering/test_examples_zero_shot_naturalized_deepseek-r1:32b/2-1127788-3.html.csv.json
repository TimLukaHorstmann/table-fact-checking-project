    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"rafael m\u00e1rquez score 3 goal in his career at international friendly competition\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: It says that Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored 3 goals in his international friendly competitions. So I need to look for entries in the table where the competition is a 'friendly' and sum up the goals he scored in those matches.\n\nLooking at the table structure provided, each row has columns: goal, date, score, result, and competition. The \"goal\" column seems to be an incremental count of his total career goals, so it's not directly linked to specific competitions. Instead, I should focus on the 'competition' column to find which rows are friendlies.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Competition is 1999 Carlsberg Cup \u2013 Not a friendly.\nRow 2: 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup \u2013 Not a friendly.\nRow 3: 2002 World Cup Qualifier \u2013 Not a friendly.\nRow 4: Friendly \u2013 Yes, so this row counts. The goal here is number 4.\nRow 5: 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup \u2013 Not a friendly.\nRow 6: 2006 World Cup Qualifier \u2013 Not a friendly.\nRow 7: 2006 World Cup Qualifier \u2013 Not a friendly.\nRow 8: 2006 FIFA World Cup \u2013 Not a friendly.\nRow 9: Friendly \u2013 Yes, this counts. Goal number 9.\nRow 10: 2010 World Cup Qualifier \u2013 Not a friendly.\nRow 11: 2010 FIFA World Cup \u2013 Not a friendly.\nRow 12: 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup \u2013 Not a friendly.\nRow 13: Friendly \u2013 Yes, this counts. Goal number 13.\n\nSo the rows that are friendlies are Rows 4, 9, and 13. Now, looking at these rows:\n\nRow 4: Score is 2-1, so he scored once here (since it's his goal count as 4).\nWait, actually, I'm a bit confused. The 'score' column shows the match score, but does that mean how many goals he personally scored? Or is it the team's score?\n\nHmm, on closer inspection, the 'goal' column seems to be the cumulative number of goals in his career. So each row represents one goal he scored. Therefore, in each of these friendly rows (4,9,13), he has 3 separate goals.\n\nSo, in total, he has three goals in friendly competitions.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because he scored 3 goals in international friendlies as per Rows 4, 9, and 13.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored 3 goals in his international friendly career. Checking the table for rows where the competition is 'friendly', we find three such entries: goal numbers 4 (Row 4), 9 (Row 9), and 13 (Row 13). Each of these represents a separate goal in a friendly match, confirming that he scored exactly 3 goals in friendlies.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"goal\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal at both the 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cup\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored in two specific FIFA World Cups: 2006 and 2010. So, I need to check if there are entries in the table corresponding to these competitions where he scored goals.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a goal with details like date, score, result, and competition. The columns are \"goal\", \"date\", \"score\", \"result\", and \"competition\". \n\nI'll start by identifying which rows correspond to the 2006 FIFA World Cup and the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\nScanning through each row:\n\n- Row 8: Competition is \"2006 fifa world cup\". The score here is 1-0, so a goal was scored. This indicates M\u00e1rquez scored in the 2006 World Cup.\n  \n- Looking for the 2010 World Cup, I check each row. Row 11 mentions \"2010 fifa world cup\" as the competition. The score is 1-1, so a goal was scored there as well.\n\nBoth competitions are present in the table with goals scored by M\u00e1rquez. Therefore, the claim is supported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"2000 be the only year rafael m\u00e1rquez score more than 1 goal in international competition\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It states that in the year 2000, Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in international competitions, and that this was the only year he achieved this.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match where goals were scored by Rafael M\u00e1rquez. The relevant columns here are \"date\" (to determine the year), \"goal\" (the number of goals scored in that particular match), and \"competition\" to ensure it's an international competition.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Date is February 5, 1999. Goals: 1. Year is 1999. Only one goal here.\n2. **Row 2**: Date is February 13, 2000. Goals: 2. Competition is the Concacaf Gold Cup, which is international. So in 2000, he scored two goals in this match.\n3. **Row 3**: September 3, 2000. Goals: 5-1, so M\u00e1rquez scored 5? Wait, no\u2014the \"goal\" column seems to indicate the number of goals he scored in that game. So here it's goal:3, meaning he scored three times in this match. That adds up to more than one goal in 2000.\n4. **Row 4**: May 12, 2002. Goals: 2-1. He scored once (goal:4). Year is 2002, so only one goal that year.\n5. **Row 5**: July 24, 2003. Goals: 2-0. M\u00e1rquez scored two goals in this match. So in 2003, he scored two goals. This contradicts the claim that 2000 was the only year he scored more than one goal.\n6. **Row 6**: June 19, 2004. Goals:3-0. He scored three goals here. So in 2004, he scored multiple goals again.\n7. **Row 7**: September 7, 2005. Score: 2-0. M\u00e1rquez scored two goals. Year is 2005\u2014another year with more than one goal.\n8. **Row 8**: June 24, 2006. Score:1-0, but the result was 1-2 (AET). So he scored once here.\n9. **Row 9**: March 28, 2007. Score:2-2. He scored twice in this match, so two goals in 2007.\n10. **Row 10**: September 10, 2008. Score:2-0. He scored twice here as well, adding to his tally for 2008.\n11. **Row 11**: June 11, 2010. Score:1-1. Only one goal in this match.\n12. **Row 12**: June 12, 2011. Score:1-0. He scored once here.\n13. **Row 13**: October 30, 2013. Score:1-0. Another single goal.\n\nWait a second, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check each row:\n\nLooking back at the \"goal\" column:\n- Row 2: goal is 2 \u2192 two goals in 2000.\n- Row 3: goal is 3 \u2192 three goals in 2000.\n\nSo in 2000, he scored a total of 2 (Row 2) + 3 (Row 3) = 5 goals across different matches. So the claim that 2000 was the only year he scored more than one goal is incorrect because in later years like 2003, 2004, 2005, etc., he also scored multiple goals.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there are other years beyond 2000 where M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in international competitions.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false. Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in several years beyond 2000.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"goal\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"Mexico only lose 1 time in international competition when Rafael M\u00e1rquez score a goal\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It says that Mexico lost only once in international competitions where Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal. So I need to check two things: how many times Mexico lost when M\u00e1rquez scored, and whether that number is exactly one.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with various details like date, score, result, competition, etc. The \"goal\" column increments from 1 to 13, so these are likely goals scored by M\u00e1rquez in his career. \n\nI'll go through each row to see when M\u00e1rquez scored and whether Mexico lost those matches.\n\nRow 1: Goal 1, Date 5 Feb 1999, Score 1-0, Result 3-0, Competition Carlsberg Cup.\nHere, the result is 3-0 in favor of Mexico. So even though M\u00e1rquez scored (goal 1), Mexico won this match.\n\nRow 2: Goal 2, Date 13 Feb 2000, Score 1-0, Result 4-0, Competition Concacaf Gold Cup.\nAgain, the result is a 4-0 win for Mexico. M\u00e1rquez scored here too, but it's a win.\n\nRow 3: Goal 3, Date 3 Sep 2000, Score 5-1, Result 7-1, Competition World Cup Qualifier.\nResult shows Mexico won 7-1. M\u00e1rquez scored, and they won.\n\nRow 4: Goal 4, Date 12 May 2002, Score 2-1, Result 2-1, Competition Friendly.\nHere, the result is 2-1 in favor of Mexico. They didn't lose; it's a win.\n\nRow 5: Goal 5, Date 24 Jul 2003, Score 1-0, Result 2-0, Competition Concacaf Gold Cup.\nAnother win for Mexico with M\u00e1rquez scoring.\n\nRow 6: Goal 6, Date 19 Jun 2004, Score 3-0, Result 3-0, Competition World Cup Qualifier.\nWin again. M\u00e1rquez scored here too.\n\nRow 7: Goal 7, Date 7 Sep 2005, Score 2-0, Result 5-0, Competition World Cup Qualifier.\nMexico won this match as well.\n\nRow 8: Goal 8, Date 24 Jun 2006, Score 1-0, Result 1-2 (aet), Competition FIFA World Cup.\nThis is the first instance where M\u00e1rquez scored and Mexico lost. The result was a loss in extra time.\n\nRow 9: Goal 9, Date 28 Mar 2007, Score 2-2, Result 4-2, Competition Friendly.\nMexico won this friendly match despite M\u00e1rquez scoring.\n\nRow 10: Goal 10, Date 10 Sep 2008, Score 2-0, Result 2-1, Competition World Cup Qualifier.\nAnother win for Mexico with M\u00e1rquez's goal.\n\nRow 11: Goal 11, Date 11 Jun 2010, Score 1-1, Result 1-1, Competition FIFA World Cup.\nThis was a draw. So even though M\u00e1rquez scored, it's not a loss.\n\nRow 12: Goal 12, Date 12 Jun 2011, Score 1-0, Result 4-1, Competition Concacaf Gold Cup.\nMexico won this match.\n\nRow 13: Goal 13, Date 30 Oct 2013, Score 1-0, Result 4-2, Competition Friendly.\nAnother win for Mexico with M\u00e1rquez's goal.\n\nSo, looking through all the rows, the only time when M\u00e1rquez scored and Mexico lost was in Row 8. All other instances where he scored resulted in either a win or a draw. Therefore, the claim that Mexico only lost once when M\u00e1rquez scored is true based on this table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"}]}\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, the task is to determine whether the claim \"Rafael M\u00e1rquez does not score a goal in international competition in 2001 or 2009 or 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table represents. It seems like each row corresponds to a specific goal scored by Rafael M\u00e1rquez. Each row has information about the goal number, date, score, result, and competition.\n\nThe claim is stating that in the years 2001, 2009, and 2012, Rafael didn't score any goals in international competitions. So, I need to check each of these years against the dates in the table to see if there's a goal scored in those years.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: February 5, 1999 \u2192 year is 1999.\n- Row 2: February 13, 2000 \u2192 year is 2000.\n- Row 3: September 3, 2000 \u2192 year 2000.\n- Row 4: May 12, 2002 \u2192 year 2002.\n- Row 5: July 24, 2003 \u2192 year 2003.\n- Row 6: June 19, 2004 \u2192 year 2004.\n- Row 7: September 7, 2005 \u2192 year 2005.\n- Row 8: June 24, 2006 \u2192 year 2006.\n- Row 9: March 28, 2007 \u2192 year 2007.\n- Row 10: September 10, 2008 \u2192 year 2008.\n- Row 11: June 11, 2010 \u2192 year 2010.\n- Row 12: June 12, 2011 \u2192 year 2011.\n- Row 13: October 30, 2013 \u2192 year 2013.\n\nNow, the years in question are 2001, 2009, and 2012. I'll check each of these:\n\n1. **2001**: Looking at the table, there are no goals scored in 2001. The closest is 2000 (rows 1-3) and then 2002 (row4). So, no goal in 2001.\n\n2. **2009**: Checking row 10: September 10, 2008 \u2192 year 2008. Next is row11: June 11, 2010 \u2192 2010. There's no goal in 2009.\n\n3. **2012**: The last few rows are 2010 (row11), 2011 (row12), and then row13 is October 30, 2013 \u2192 2013. There's no goal in 2012.\n\nSo, none of the years 2001, 2009, or 2012 have any goals by Rafael M\u00e1rquez as per the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because there are no goals in those specific years mentioned.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells: For each year (2001, 2009, 2012), I should look at the rows where the date falls within those years and check if any goal was scored. However, since none of these years have goals, the relevant cells are all the 'date' columns from row1 to row13 because they show that no dates fall in those years.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's better to list each relevant cell where the year is close or near 2001, 2009, and 2012. For example:\n\n- Rows before 2001 (row1-row3) are in 1999 and 2000.\n- Between 2001 and 2009: rows4 to row10 include years 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008. So, no goal in 2001 or 2009.\n- Between 2009 and 2012: rows10 to row12 are 2008, 2010, 2011. No goals in 2009 or 2012.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be all the 'date' columns from each row because they show that no goal was scored in those specific years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n      {\"row\": 1, \"column\": \"date\"},\n      {\"row\": 2, \"column\": \"date\"},\n      {\"row\": 3, \"column\": \"date\"},\n      {\"row\": 4, \"column\": \"date\"},\n      {\"row\": 5, \"column\": \"date\"},\n      {\"row\": 6, \"column\": \"date\"},\n      {\"row\": 7, \"column\": \"date\"},\n      {\"row\": 8, \"column\": \"date\"},\n      {\"row\": 9, \"column\": \"date\"},\n      {\"row\": 10, \"column\": \"date\"},\n      {\"row\": 11, \"column\": \"date\"},\n      {\"row\": 12, \"column\": \"date\"},\n      {\"row\": 13, \"column\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. The subject is Rafael M\u00e1rquez, and the claim is about the number of goals he scored in international friendly competitions. Specifically, it states that he scored fewer than 3 goals. So, my task is to check how many goals M\u00e1rquez has scored in friendly matches according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match with details like goal number, date, score, result, and competition type. The relevant columns for this claim are \"goal\" (to count the goals) and \"competition\" (to identify if it's a friendly).\n\nI'll go through each row to check where the competition is listed as \"friendly.\" Let's start from Row 1:\n\n- **Row 1**: Competition is \"1999 carlsberg cup\" \u2013 not friendly.\n- **Row 2**: \"2000 concacaf gold cup\" \u2013 not friendly.\n- **Row 3**: \"2002 world cup qualifier\" \u2013 nope.\n- **Row 4**: Here, competition is listed as \"friendly.\" So this is a relevant row. The goal number here is 4 (from the 'goal' column). That means M\u00e1rquez scored one goal in a friendly match.\n\nContinuing to check other rows:\n\n- **Row 5**: \"2003 concacaf gold cup\" \u2013 not friendly.\n- **Row 6**: \"2006 world cup qualifier\" \u2013 nope.\n- **Row 7**: Another qualifier, so not friendly.\n- **Row 8**: The competition is the \"2006 fifa world cup\" \u2013 not a friendly match.\n- **Row 9**: Here, it's another \"friendly.\" So this is another relevant row. Goal number here is 9.\n\nMoving on:\n\n- **Row 10**: \"2010 world cup qualifier\" \u2013 not friendly.\n- **Row 11**: It's the \"2010 fifa world cup,\" so nope.\n- **Row 12**: \"2011 concacaf gold cup\" \u2013 not a friendly match.\n- **Row 13**: Competition is \"friendly.\" Goal number is 13. So this is another relevant row.\n\nWait, let me recount the rows where competition is 'friendly':\n\n- Row 4: goal 4\n- Row 9: goal 9\n- Row 13: goal 13\n\nThat's three goals in friendly matches. The claim says \"fewer than 3,\" which would mean 2 or fewer. But according to the table, M\u00e1rquez scored 3 goals in friendly competitions.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because he scored exactly 3 goals, not fewer than 3.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant rows are Rows 4, 9, and 13 where the competition type is 'friendly.' Each of these rows shows a goal scored by Rafael M\u00e1rquez in friendly matches. Since there are three such goals, the claim stating fewer than 3 is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"goal\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal at the 2006 FIFA World Cup but remained scoreless during the 2010 FIFA World Cup\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any entries related to the 2006 FIFA World Cup in the table. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 8 mentions the competition as \"2006 fifa world cup\". The goal number here is 8, and the score is 1-0, with a result of 1-2 (after extra time). This indicates that Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in this match. So, the first part of the claim is supported.\n\nNext, I'll check for any goals scored by him during the 2010 FIFA World Cup:\n\nLooking through all rows, none of them have the competition listed as \"2010 fifa world cup\". There's a row (Row 11) with the competition as \"2010 world cup qualifier\", but that's not the actual World Cup itself. Since there are no entries for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, it implies he didn't score any goals during that event.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the table. He scored in the 2006 World Cup and did not score in the 2010 World Cup.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"goal\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "2000 be 1 of 2 year rafael m\u00e1rquez score more than 1 goal in international competition",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"2000 be 1 of 2 year rafael m\u00e1rquez score more than 1 goal in international competition.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that in the year 2000, Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in an international competition. Also, it seems to imply that 2000 was one of two years where he achieved this. But for now, I'll focus on verifying if in 2000, he indeed scored more than one goal.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match with details like date, score, result, and competition. The \"goal\" column seems to be just an incrementing number, so it's not indicating how many goals were scored by M\u00e1rquez specifically in that match. Wait, actually, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The \"score\" column shows the team's score versus the opponent, but without knowing which player scored, I can't directly attribute the goals to M\u00e1rquez.\n\nWait a minute, looking again, perhaps each row is a goal that M\u00e1rquez scored? That would make more sense because each row has a unique \"goal\" number. So Row 1: goal 1, date February 5, 1999, and so on. If that's the case, then each entry represents one of his goals in international competitions.\n\nSo now, I need to check how many times he scored in 2000. Let me go through each row and see which ones fall within the year 2000.\n\nRow 1: 5 February 1999 \u2013 that's 1999.\nRow 2: 13 February 2000 \u2013 that's 2000.\nRow 3: 3 September 2000 \u2013 also 2000.\nRows beyond that are in later years, so I can stop once I pass 2000.\n\nSo Row 2 and Row 3 are both from 2000. Each of these rows represents a goal scored by M\u00e1rquez in international competitions. Therefore, he scored at least two goals in 2000. That would make the claim TRUE because 2000 is one of the years (in this case, the only year shown) where he scored more than one goal.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions \"1 of 2 year,\" implying that there's another year besides 2000 where he scored more than one goal. However, looking at the table, I don't see any other years with multiple goals except for maybe checking if in any other year he has two or more entries.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n- Row 1: 1999 \u2013 only one entry.\n- Rows 2 and 3: 2000 \u2013 two entries.\n- Row 4: May 2002 \u2013 one goal.\n- Rows 5,6,7: 2003 to July 2003 (Row5), June 2004 (Row6), September 2005 (Row7) \u2013 each is a single goal except Row7 which is 2005 and has one entry.\n- Rows 8 to 13: These are from 2006 onwards, each with single goals except maybe checking if any have multiple.\n\nWait, let me recount all rows by year:\n- 1999: 1 goal\n- 2000: 2 goals (Rows 2 and 3)\n- 2002: Row4 is May 2002 \u2013 one goal\n- 2003: Row5, July 2003 \u2013 one goal\n- 2004: Row6, June 2004 \u2013 one goal\n- 2005: Row7, September 2005 \u2013 one goal (scored two goals in that match?)\nWait, the \"score\" column for Row7 is 2-0. Does this mean M\u00e1rquez scored two goals in that match? Or was it his team's score?\n\nHmm, maybe I misinterpreted earlier. The \"score\" might be the team's overall score, not individual player stats. So if a row has a score of 2-0, does that mean M\u00e1rquez scored both goals? Or just one? Because each row represents a single goal by him.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me clarify: Each row in the table lists a specific goal (e.g., goal 1, goal 2) with details about when it was scored and in which competition. So each entry corresponds to a separate match where he scored at least one goal. Therefore, if a row has a score of 2-0, that means his team won 2-0, but the \"goal\" number increments by one each time. So each row is just indicating a single goal he scored in that match.\n\nSo in Row3: date September 3, 2000, competition 2002 World Cup qualifier, score 5-1 (team's score), result 5-1. So M\u00e1rquez scored one of those goals, as indicated by the \"goal\" number incrementing to 3.\n\nTherefore, in 2000, he has two separate rows: Rows2 and 3, meaning two different matches where he scored a goal each time. Thus, in 2000, he scored at least two goals in international competitions.\n\nNow, does the table show any other year with multiple goals? Let's check:\n\n- 1999: one goal (Row1)\n- 2000: two goals (Rows2 and3)\n- 2002: Row4 \u2013 one goal\n- 2003: Row5 \u2013 one goal\n- 2004: Row6 \u2013 one goal\n- 2005: Row7 \u2013 one goal\n- 2006: Row8 \u2013 one goal (in the World Cup final)\n- 2007: Rows9,10 \u2013 two goals in 2007? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, actually:\n\nRow9: April 2007 \u2013 one goal\n\nRow10: May 2007 \u2013 another goal. So that's two goals in 2007 as well.\n\nSo in 2007, he has Rows9 and10, both from April and May 2007. Therefore, in 2007, he also scored at least two goals.\n\nThus, the claim that \"2000 is one of two years where he scored more than one goal\" holds true because 2007 is another year with multiple goals.\n\nWait, but how many total years have multiple goals? Let me list all the years and count:\n\n- 1999: 1\n- 2000: 2 (Rows2,3)\n- 2002:1\n- 2003:1\n- 2004:1\n- 2005:1\n- 2006:1 (Row8)\n- 2007:2 (Rows9,10)\n- 2010: Row11 \u2013 one goal\n- 2013: Rows12 and13 \u2013 two goals\n\nWait, hold on. Rows12 and13 are from April and May 2013? Let me check the dates:\n\nRow12: April 25, 2013\n\nRow13: May 29, 2013\n\nSo that's two more goals in 2013. So actually, there are three years where he scored multiple goals: 2000, 2007, and 2013.\n\nBut the claim says \"1 of 2 year,\" implying only two such years. However, based on this table, it's at least three years (2000, 2007, 2013) where he scored more than one goal each.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The user might just be asking about 2000 and whether he scored multiple goals in that year, regardless of other years. Or maybe the claim was that 2000 is one such year among others.\n\nBut according to the table, yes, in 2000 he has two separate goals (Rows2 and3). Therefore, the answer is TRUE for 2000 being a year where he scored more than once.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if M\u00e1rquez scored multiple goals in international competitions during the year 2000 based on the provided table:\n\n1. **Identify Entries from 2000:**\n   - Row 2: February 13, 2000\n   - Row 3: September 3, 2000\n\n2. **Count Goals in 2000:**\n   Each row represents a separate goal scored by M\u00e1rquez. Therefore, he scored two goals in 2000.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim that M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in international competitions during the year 2000 is TRUE.\n\n\\boxed{True}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nThe claim says: \"Mexico lose 1 of 2 times in international competition when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scores a goal.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this means. It seems that the claim is stating that when Rafael M\u00e1rquez (a Mexican player) scores a goal for Mexico, Mexico lost once out of two such instances.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match where M\u00e1rquez scored a goal. Each row has details like date, score, result, and competition type.\n\nSo, I need to check each row to see whether Mexico won or lost when M\u00e1rquez scored. The \"result\" column seems crucial here because it shows the final outcome of the match.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Result is 3-0 in favor of Mexico (since the first number is 3). So, Mexico won here.\n2. **Row 2**: Result is 4-0 for Mexico again; they won.\n3. **Row 3**: Result is 7-1; Mexico won.\n4. **Row 4**: Result is 2-1; Mexico won.\n5. **Row 5**: Result is 2-0; Mexico won.\n6. **Row 6**: Result is 3-0; Mexico won.\n7. **Row 7**: Result is 5-0; Mexico won.\n8. **Row 8**: The result is listed as 1-2 (aet). So, Mexico lost this match in extra time.\n9. **Row 9**: Result is 4-2; Mexico won.\n10. **Row 10**: Result is 2-1; Mexico won.\n11. **Row 11**: Result is 1-1; it's a draw, not a loss.\n12. **Row 12**: Result is 4-1; Mexico won.\n13. **Row 13**: Result is 4-2; Mexico won.\n\nNow, compiling the results:\n\n- Total number of matches where M\u00e1rquez scored: 13\n- Matches where Mexico lost: Only Row 8 (result 1-2 aet)\n- Matches where Mexico drew: None, except maybe considering a draw as not a loss, but in this case, only one match resulted in a loss.\n\nSo according to the table, out of 13 matches where M\u00e1rquez scored, Mexico lost just once. The claim states that \"Mexico lose 1 of 2 times,\" which implies that half of the time (50%) when M\u00e1rquez scores, Mexico loses. However, looking at the data, it's only one loss out of thirteen wins and one draw.\n\nTherefore, the claim doesn't hold because the actual number of losses is much lower than what the claim suggests. The relevant cells to check are each row's \"result\" column to see if Mexico lost when M\u00e1rquez scored.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Mexico won in all but one match where Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal, contradicting the claim of losing 1 out of 2 times. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"Rafael M\u00e1rquez do not remain scoreless in international competition in 2001 or 2009 or 2012.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what this means. The statement is saying that in each of those years\u20142001, 2009, and 2012\u2014Rafael M\u00e1rquez did not remain without scoring any goals in international competitions. In other words, he scored at least one goal in each of those years.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see it lists various rows with details about each goal M\u00e1rquez scored, including the date, score, result, and competition. My task is to check if there's a goal from M\u00e1rquez in 2001, 2009, or 2012.\n\nLet me go through each year one by one:\n\n1. **2001**: I need to see if any of the goals were scored in this year. Checking the dates:\n   - Row 3: Date is 3 September 2000 (Competition: 2002 World Cup qualifier)\n   - Next, Row 4 is May 2002\n   So, there's no goal listed for 2001.\n\n2. **2009**: Looking at the table:\n   - The closest dates are September 2008 (Row 10: World Cup qualifier) and June 2010 (World Cup). There's a gap between 2008 and 2010, so no goals in 2009.\n\n3. **2012**: The last entry is October 2013, but the previous ones are up to June 2011 (Row 12: 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup). So, there's no goal listed for 2012 either.\n\nSince none of these years have a corresponding row in the table where M\u00e1rquez scored a goal, it implies that he did remain scoreless in international competitions during those years.
