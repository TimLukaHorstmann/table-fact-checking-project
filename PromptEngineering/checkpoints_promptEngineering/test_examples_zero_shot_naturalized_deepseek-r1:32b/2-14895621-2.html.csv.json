    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's see what I need to do here. The task is to determine whether the claim \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng 3 time at tournament\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has several rows and columns: outcome, event, year, venue, and partner. Each row seems to represent a different tournament or competition.\n\nThe claim mentions \"hwang sun,\" but looking through the table, I don't see any entry where the partner is \"hwang sun.\" Instead, all the relevant entries under the \"partner\" column are either \"kang haeng - suk\" or something else like \"world championships,\" \"asian games,\" etc. So it seems that Hwang Sun isn't listed as a partner in this table.\n\nNext, the claim says they partnered three times. I'll check how many times Kang Haeng appears as a partner with someone. Looking at the rows:\n\n- Row 2: partner is kang haeng - suk\n- Row 4: partner is kang haeng - suk\n- Row 6: partner is kang haeng - suk\n\nSo there are three instances where Kang Haeng is listed as a partner, but each time it's with someone else, not Hwang Sun. Therefore, even though the number of partnerships is correct (three times), the partners aren't Hwang Sun.\n\nSince there's no mention of Hwang Sun partnering with Kang Haeng in the table, the claim isn't supported by the data provided. So, I should mark this as FALSE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: I need to identify which parts of the table are checked. The partner column is key here because it specifies who was partnered with whom. So for each row that mentions Kang Haeng, those are the relevant ones:\n\n- Row 2's partner\n- Row 4's partner\n- Row 6's partner\n\nThese are all in the \"partner\" column, so I'll list them as such.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there's no record of Hwang Sun partnering with Kang Haeng three times; instead, it shows Kang Haeng partnering with someone else three times.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng for the first time at the 1985 world championship in calgary, canada.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for any mention of \"hwang sun\" in the table. Scanning through all rows, I don't see any row where the partner is listed as hwa ng sun or any similar name. The partners mentioned are either \"kang haeng - suk\" or generic terms like \"world championships.\" So, there's no direct evidence of hwang sun being a partner.\n\nNext, checking the years and events: In row 2, there's an event 'wd' in 1985 at Calgary, Canada with partner kang haeng - suk. Row 6 also mentions 1985, but it's the India Open. The World Championships are mentioned in row 1, but all details under that row are labeled as \"world championships,\" which seems like a header or placeholder rather than specific data.\n\nThe claim refers to the 1985 World Championship in Calgary, which would likely be in row 2 since it's the only one with 1985 and Calgary. However, the partner there is kang haeng - suk, not hwang sun. \n\nSince there's no mention of hwang sun as a partner, especially for the first time at that event, the claim isn't supported by the table data. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim and check each part against the data in the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"In 1982, Hwang Sun participate in the Asian Game in the double woman's double event, finish first, 1 of 2 times she win an event with Kang Haeng.\"\n\nFirst, I'll identify the key pieces of information from the claim:\n\n1. **Year**: 1982\n2. **Event**: Asian Games (specifically women's doubles)\n3. **Outcome**: Finish first (i.e., won)\n4. **Partner**: Kang Haeng\n5. **Total wins with partner**: This is the second win (since it's mentioned as \"1 of 2 times\")\n\nNow, I'll go through each row in the table to find relevant information.\n\n**Row 1**: All columns say \"world championships.\" Not relevant here since we're looking for Asian Games and 1982.\n\n**Row 2**: Year is 1985. Doesn't match 1982, so skip.\n\n**Row 3**: Outcome, event, year, venue, partner all say \"asian games.\" The outcome here isn't specified numerically, just the event type. This row might be relevant for the event and year if it had specific data, but since it's generic, I need to check other rows for specifics.\n\n**Row 4**: Outcome is 1 (indicating first place), event is \"wd\" which likely stands for women's doubles, year is 1982. The venue is New Delhi, India, and the partner is Kang Haeng-suk. This row matches several parts of the claim: the correct year, event type, outcome, and partner.\n\n**Row 5**: All columns say \"other open tournaments.\" Not relevant for Asian Games.\n\n**Row 6**: Year is 1985 again, so doesn't match 1982.\n\nNow, checking Row 4:\n- **Year**: Correct (1982)\n- **Event**: \"wd\" likely stands for women's doubles in the Asian Games.\n- **Outcome**: 1 means first place, which matches finishing first.\n- **Partner**: Kang Haeng-suk is listed, matching the claim.\n\nThe claim mentions that this was one of two times she won with Kang Haeng. From the table, I see only Row 4 and possibly another event in 1985 (Row 6). However, Row 6's year doesn't match 1982, so perhaps it refers to a different event. But since the claim is about 1982 specifically, and Row 4 shows one win, I need to verify if there are two wins in total.\n\nLooking again:\n- In 1982 (Row 4): Win with Kang Haeng-suk.\n- In 1985 (Row 6): Another win with the same partner. \n\nSo, that would make it two times she won an event with Kang Haeng-suk, which aligns with the claim stating \"1 of 2 times.\" Therefore, all parts of the claim are supported by Row 4 and considering the context from Row 6.\n\nI'll note the relevant cells as those in Row 4: outcome, event, year, venue, partner. These confirm the specific details about Hwang Sun's participation, her finish, the event type, and her partner.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"event\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"Hwang Sun partner with Kang Haeng at the 1985 India Open finish first 2 year after win the Asian Game.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse each part of this claim and see if it matches any information in the table.\n\nThe main points in the claim are:\n1. Hwang Sun partners with Kang Haeng.\n2. This partnership was at the 1985 India Open.\n3. They finished first there.\n4. Two years after winning the Asian Game.\n\nLet me go through each part step by step.\n\nStarting with point 1: Checking if Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng in any event. Looking at the table, I don't see \"Hwang Sun\" mentioned anywhere. Instead, the partner names listed are \"kang haeng - suk.\" So maybe it's a typo or misinterpretation. Perhaps the claim meant to say that someone partnered with Kang Haeng, but since Hwang Sun isn't in the table, this might be an issue.\n\nPoint 2: The event is the 1985 India Open. Let's look for events related to 1985 and \"India\" or \"calgary\" (since one venue mentions Calgary, Canada). In row 6, I see the year is 1985, the event is \"wd,\" which might stand for women's doubles? The venue is listed as \"india open.\" So that seems to match.\n\nPoint 3: They finished first. Looking at outcome in row 6, it's marked as 1, which I think means first place. So this part checks out.\n\nPoint 4: Two years after winning the Asian Game. Let's see if there was an Asian Games win two years before 1985, so that would be 1983. But looking through the table, in row 3, the outcome is \"asian games,\" event is \"asian games,\" year is \"asian games.\" That seems like a placeholder or maybe incorrect because it's repeating the same word for all columns. Wait, actually, looking again, row 4 has year 1982 and outcome 1. So if they won the Asian Games in 1982, then two years later would be 1984. But the claim says 1985 is two years after the Asian Game win. That's a three-year gap, not two. Or maybe the Asian Game was in 1983? The table doesn't show that.\n\nWait, row 3 has year as \"asian games,\" which isn't helpful. So perhaps the only relevant data is row 4: outcome 1 (win), event wd, year 1982, venue New Delhi, India, partner kang haeng - suk. If they won in 1982, then two years later would be 1984, but the claim says 1985. So that's a discrepancy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe row 3 is intended to represent an Asian Game with year 1983? But since it's just \"asian games\" in all columns, I can't confirm that. Therefore, the timeline might not align as the claim suggests.\n\nAlso, regarding point 1, since Hwang Sun isn't mentioned, maybe the claim is incorrect there too. Or perhaps it's a misstatement and should be someone else partnering with Kang Haeng.\n\nSo putting it all together: The India Open in 1985 (row 6) has partner kang haeng - suk, outcome 1. So that part is correct. However, the Asian Game win was in 1982 (row 4), so two years later would be 1984, not 1985. Plus, Hwang Sun isn't listed as a partner but another person with a different name.\n\nTherefore, some parts of the claim don't align with the table data. Specifically, the timeline between the Asian Game win and the India Open is off by a year, and the partnership mention doesn't include Hwang Sun.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions Hwang Sun partnering with Kang Haeng in 1985 at the India Open, finishing first two years after winning the Asian Games. Checking the table:\n\n- The 1985 India Open (row 6) shows a win (outcome 1) by Kang Haeng - Suk.\n- The Asian Games win was in 1982 (row 4), so two years later would be 1984, not 1985.\n- Hwang Sun isn't listed as a partner.\n\nThus, the claim is incorrect due to timeline and partnership details.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Asian game: This likely refers to events related to the Asian Games.\n4. 5 times at tournament: So, there should be five instances where they were partners at tournaments.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- Each row has columns: outcome, event, year, venue, partner.\n- Rows 1,3,5 have \"world championships\", \"asian games\", and \"other open tournaments\" respectively in all their cells. These seem to be header rows or placeholders, not actual data entries.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\nRow 2:\n- outcome: 3\n- event: wd (maybe women's doubles)\n- year: 1985\n- venue: calgary, canada\n- partner: kang haeng - suk\n\nRow 4:\n- outcome: 1\n- event: wd\n- year: 1982\n- venue: new delhi, india\n- partner: kang haeng - suk\n\nRow6:\n- outcome: 1\n- event: wd\n- year: 1985\n- venue: india open\n- partner: kang haeng - suk\n\nSo, all three data rows have Hwang Sun's partner as kang haeng - suk.

However, looking at the table:\n- There are only 3 instances where Hwang Sun partnered with kang haeng - suk.\n- None of these rows explicitly mention an Asian Games event beyond row3, which seems to be a header and not actual data.\n\nWait, row3 has all columns as \"asian games\", but that's likely just the category. The relevant data is in rows 2,4,6 where they have specific events like \"wd\" (women's doubles) with years and venues. None of these specify Asian Games as the event; rather, those are separate entries.\n\nSo, the claim says Hwang Sun partnered five times at tournaments related to the Asian Games, but according to the table, there are only three instances where she partnered with kang haeng - suk, and none specifically mention participating in the Asian Games more than once or even multiple times.

Let's scan through the 'partner' column in the table. Looking at rows 2,4,6: all have \"kang haeng - suk\" as the partner. So the partner part seems correct.\n\n2. **First time partnership**: The claim states this is their first time partnering. To check that, we need to see if there are any earlier entries where they were partners. Looking through rows 1-6:\n   - Row 4: Year 1982, outcome 1, partner kang haeng.\n   - Rows before that (rows 2 and maybe others) aren't clear because some years are listed as \"world championships\" or \"asian games\", which might not be specific years. But the first numerical year is 1982 in row 4.\n\n3. **Event details**: The claim mentions \"world championship\" but also says it was at the India Open venue. Let's check:\n   - For world championship, looking at outcome 'world championships' in rows 1 and 3: those are general entries without specific years or venues.\n   - Row 4 has event 'wd', which I assume stands for world doubles. The year is 1982, venue is New Delhi, India. So this seems to be a specific event.\n\nWait, the claim says it was at the \"India Open\" in 1982, but according to row 6: venue is \"india open\", event 'wd', year 1985. That's a different year. So if the 1982 event was in New Delhi (row4), and India Open was in 1985 (row6), then the claim might be mixing up the venue.\n\nPutting it together:\n- Partner is correct.\n- First time: row4 is the first occurrence with a numerical year, so maybe that's their first partnership.\n- The event in 1982 was at New Delhi, not India Open.

However, the outcome here is '3', not second place.\n\nRow 4 mentions the Asian Games in 1982 with outcome '1', so that doesn't fit the 1985 claim.\n\n**Step 2: Women's Doubles Event in 1985**\nLooking again at Row 6, it has year '1985', event 'wd' (women's doubles), venue 'India Open', partner Kang Haeng-suk, and outcome '1'. This shows a win but not the Asian Games.\n\n**Step 3: Checking for Second Place in Asian Games 1985**\nThe table doesn't have an entry where Hwang Sun finished second ('2') in the Asian Games in 1985. All entries either don't match the event, year, or outcome as per the claim.\n\n**Step 4: Number of Wins with Kang Haeng-suk**\nThe claim states she won two out of three times. Checking the rows where partner is Kang Haeng-suk:\n\n- Row 2: Outcome '3' (possibly third place)\n- Row 4: Outcome '1' (win)\n- Row 6: Outcome '1' (win)\n\nSo, in these three entries with Kang Haeng-suk as a partner, she won twice (Row 4 and 6) but finished third once (Row 2). However, the claim mentions finishing second, which isn't supported by any row.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe table doesn't have an entry where Hwang Sun finished second in the Asian Games in 1985. While there are wins with Kang Haeng-suk, the specific outcome of finishing second isn't present. Therefore, the claim is not fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break down the claim and check each part against the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng at the 1982 new delhi , india finish first 2 year after win the world championship\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse this into key components:\n\n1. Partner: hwang sun's partner is kang haeng.\n2. Event location and year: The event took place in New Delhi, India in 1982.\n3. Outcome: They finished first.\n4. Additional info: This happened two years after winning the world championship.\n\nNow, I'll check each part against the table rows.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 2: Event is 'wd' (probably World Doubles), year 1985, venue Calgary, Canada, partner kang haeng-suk. Outcome is 3.\n- Row 4: Event is 'wd', year 1982, venue New Delhi, India, partner kang haeng-suk. Outcome is 1.\n\nSo, in 1982 at New Delhi, they won first place (outcome 1). That matches the event details in the claim.\n\nNow, checking if this was two years after a world championship win. The table's Row 1 has outcome 'world championships', but it doesn't specify the year. Rows 4 and 6 have outcomes of 1 and 3 respectively, but they don't mention winning a world championship. There's no row indicating a world championship win in 1980 (which would be two years before 1982). \n\nTherefore, while the event details are correct for 1982, there's no evidence of them winning a world championship two years prior. Hence, the claim isn't fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because although Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng-Suk won first place in New Delhi in 1982 (Row 4), there's no record of them winning a world championship in 1980.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"With her partner Kang Haeng , Hwang Sun finish first at 3 different venues from 1982 to 1985.\" So, we need to check if Hwang Sun and her partner Kang Haeng won three times in different venues between those years.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 2: Outcome is 3, Event is WD, Year 1985, Venue Calgary, Canada, Partner Kang Haeng. So outcome of 3 might mean they finished third here.\n\nRow 4: Outcome is 1, Event WD, Year 1982, Venue New Delhi, India, Partner Kang Haeng. Outcome 1 means first place.\n\nRow 6: Outcome is 1, Event WD, Year 1985, Venue India Open, Partner Kang Haeng. So another first place here.\n\nWait, the claim says \"finish first,\" so we're looking for outcome '1'. \n\nSo in Row 4 and Row 6, Hwang Sun with Kang Haeng finished first. That's two venues: New Delhi (1982) and India Open (1985). But where is the third venue? The claim says three different venues.\n\nLooking back at Row 2: Outcome is 3, so that's a third place finish in Calgary. So even though they were partners there, Hwang Sun didn't finish first here.\n\nSo only two first-place finishes are present in the table for Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng. The claim says three different venues where they finished first, but we only have two. Therefore, the claim is false because it mentions three venues, but only two are supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Hwang Sun and her partner Kang Haeng finished first at 3 different venues between 1982 and 1985. However, the table shows two instances where they finished first (rows 4 and 6) and one instance where they finished third (row 2). There are only two venues with a first-place finish, not three.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
