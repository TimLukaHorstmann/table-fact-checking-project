    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"2 of the artist get a double digit percent vote\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a \"double digit percent vote\" means. That refers to any percentage that is 10% or higher because single digits are 0-9, and double digits start at 10. So, I'm looking for artists whose televote/SMS percentages are 10% or more.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"televote / sms\" column which shows the percentage of votes each artist received. Let's go through each row to check these values:\n\n- Row 1: 2.95% \u2192 Single digit.\n- Row 2: 0.37% \u2192 Single digit.\n- Row 3: 11.74% \u2192 Double digit (since it's over 10%).\n- Row 4: 2.39% \u2192 Single digit.\n- Row 5: 2.53% \u2192 Single digit.\n- Row 6: 3.91% \u2192 Single digit.\n- Row 7: 3.20% \u2192 Single digit.\n- Row 8: 8.45% \u2192 Wait, 8.45 is still single digit because it's less than 10%. So this is single.\n- Row 9: 2.03% \u2192 Single digit.\n- Row 10: 1.16% \u2192 Single digit.\n- Row 11: 55.52% \u2192 Double digit, definitely over 10%.\n- Row 12: 5.75% \u2192 Single digit.\n\nSo from the above, only two artists have double-digit percentages: Row 3 with 11.74% and Row 11 with 55.52%. That means exactly 2 artists received a double-digit vote percentage.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there are indeed two artists who got over 10% in their televote/SMS votes.\n\nThe relevant cells that support this conclusion are the \"televote / sms\" values for Row 3 and Row 11. Each of these rows has a value above 10%, confirming the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 5 artist that only have one name\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says there are five artists who only have one name each. In other words, their names shouldn't have any spaces\u2014each artist should be referred to with a single word or mononym.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll examine the 'artist' column for each row and count how many have only one name. \n\nRow 1: Stefan Ilchev \u2013 two names.\nRow 2: Moto \u2013 one name.\nRow 3: Poli Genova \u2013 two names.\nRow 4: Danny Milev \u2013 two names.\nRow 5: Ivelina \u2013 one name.\nRow 6: Grafa \u2013 one name.\nRow 7: Sahara \u2013 one name.\nRow 8: Mariana Popova \u2013 two names.\nRow 9: Jura Tone feat Lady B \u2013 this seems like multiple artists or a collaboration. 'Jura Tone' is one, 'Lady B' another? Or perhaps it's a single stage name with \"feat.\" indicating a collaboration. This might complicate things because if it's considered as one artist (with a full name including \"feat\"), then maybe it's two names, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, \"Jura Tone\" could be the main artist and \"Lady B\" is featured. For simplicity, let's consider 'Jura Tone' as part of the artist name, which is two words. So perhaps this counts as one artist with a single stage name or multiple names.\nRow 10: Stefan Dobrev \u2013 two names.\nRow 11: Krassimir Avramov \u2013 two names.\nRow 12: Nora \u2013 one name.\n\nNow, let's count the artists with only one name:\n\n- Row 2: Moto (1)\n- Row 5: Ivelina (2)\n- Row 6: Grafa (3)\n- Row 7: Sahara (4)\n- Row 12: Nora (5)\n\nWait, that gives us five artists. But let's double-check row 9. The artist is listed as \"Jura Tone feat lady b.\" Depending on interpretation, this could be a single artist with the name \"Jura Tone\" featuring another artist \"Lady B,\" but in terms of the 'artist' column here, it's written as one entry. If we count each part separately, that might change things. However, based on how it's presented, I think it's considered one artist (with a collaboration note), so perhaps it doesn't add to the count. Alternatively, if \"Jura Tone\" and \"Lady B\" are two separate artists, but in this table, they're listed as a single entry under 'artist' with \"feat.\" indicating a feature.\n\nSo assuming that row 9 is one artist (maybe the main act), then we have five artists: Moto, Ivelina, Grafa, Sahara, and Nora. That would make the claim TRUE because there are exactly five artists with only one name each.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n1. Moto (Row2)\n2. Ivelina (Row5)\n3. Grafa (Row6)\n4. Sahara (Row7)\n5. Nora (Row12)\n\nYes, that's five.

The claim states: \"first place get 55.52 percent of the vote, and last place get 0.37 percent of the vote.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the table structure. Each row has several columns: draw number, artist, song, televote/sms percentage, and place.\n\nLooking at the claim, there are two parts to verify:\n1. The first place received exactly 55.52% of the votes.\n2. The last place received exactly 0.37% of the votes.\n\nI'll check each part step by step.\n\nFor the first part: Who is in first place? Scanning the \"place\" column, I see that row 11 has a place value of 1. Looking at the televote/sms percentage for row 11, it's 55.52%. So this matches the claim.\n\nNext, for the second part: Who is in last place? The highest \"place\" number indicates the last position. In the table, the highest place is 12 (row 12). Wait, no, actually, looking again, row 10 has a place of 11 and row 12 has place 4, so I need to check which row has the highest place number. Let me list all the places:\n\nRow 1:7\nRow 2:12\nRow3:2\nRow4:9\nRow5:8\nRow6:5\nRow7:6\nRow8:3\nRow9:10\nRow10:11\nRow11:1\nRow12:4\n\nThe highest place number is 12, which is row 2.

I think it's about the number of words, so \"nyama vreme\" is two words, so no.\nRow 5: \"ready for love\" \u2013 three words.\nRow 6: \"vrag\" \u2013 that's a single word.\nRow 7: \"don' t kiss for the money\" \u2013 multiple words.\nRow 8: \"crazy\" \u2013 one word.\nRow 9: \"chance to love you\" \u2013 three words.\nRow 10: \"everlasting\" \u2013 one word.\nRow 11: \"illusion\" \u2013 one word.\nRow 12: \"it's not right\" \u2013 three words.\n\nNow, counting the songs that are single words:\n- Row 2: razstoyaniya\n- Row 6: vrag\n- Row 8: crazy\n- Row 10: everlasting\n\nWait, that's four. But wait, looking back at Row 11: \"illusion\" is also one word, but the claim says 4 artists, so if we count up to Row 12:\n\nRow 2: razstoyaniya \u2013 1\nRow 6: vrag \u2013 2\nRow 8: crazy \u20133\nRow 10: everlasting \u20134\n\nBut in my initial count, I thought Row 11 is another one-word song. So that's five. Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait the claim is about \"4 of the artist use a one name song.\" Let me list all single-word songs:\n\nRow 2: razstoyaniya \u2013 yes\nRow 6: vrag \u2013 yes\nRow 8: crazy \u2013 yes\nRow 10: everlasting \u2013 yes\nRow 11: illusion \u2013 yes\n\nThat's five. But the claim says four. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait no, let me check again:\n\nLooking at each row's song:\n\nRow 1: get up (2 words)\nRow 2: razstoyaniya (1 word)\nRow 3: one lifetime is not enough (4 words)\nRow 4: nyama vreme (2 words)\nRow 5: ready for love (3 words)\nRow 6: vrag (1 word)\nRow 7: don't kiss for the money (4 words)\nRow 8: crazy (1 word)\nRow 9: chance to love you (3 words)\nRow 10: everlasting (1 word)\nRow 11: illusion (1 word)\nRow 12: it's not right (3 words)\n\nSo the single-word songs are in rows 2,6,8,10,11. That's five artists. But the claim says four. So that would make the claim FALSE.\n\nWait, but perhaps \"one name song\" refers to the song title being a single word. So if there are five such cases, then the claim of four is incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that 4 artists have one-word song titles.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"the word love be use in a song 2 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table and understand its structure. It has several rows with columns: draw number, artist name, song title, televote/sms percentage, and place. The relevant information for this claim would be the song titles because we need to check if any songs contain the word \"love\" and how many times it's used.\n\nThe claim mentions that the word \"love\" is used in a song two times. I think there are two interpretations here: either a single song uses the word \"love\" twice, or two different songs each use the word once. However, given the phrasing, it seems more likely that the claim refers to the total number of occurrences across all songs.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 3: Song title is \"one lifetime is not enough.\" No mention of \"love.\"\n- Row 5: Song title is \"ready for love.\" This includes \"love\" once.\n- Row 8: Song title is \"crazy.\" Doesn't contain \"love.\"\n- Row 9: Song title is \"chance to love you.\" This includes \"love\" once.\n\nSo, in the table, two different songs have the word \"love\": \"ready for love\" and \"chance to love you.\" Each uses it once. Therefore, the total number of times \"love\" appears in song titles is two.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"use in a song 2 time,\" which could be interpreted as using the word twice within one song. However, based on the table, each occurrence is in a separate song. So if the claim requires two instances across songs, it's TRUE because there are two songs with \"love.\" But if it requires two mentions in the same song, then it's FALSE.\n\nBut considering the natural reading of the claim, it might be asking whether any song uses the word \"love\" twice, but in this case, each occurrence is in a different song. Alternatively, maybe it's about how many times the word appears across all songs. So if we count all instances, there are two. \n\nWait, another angle: perhaps the claim refers to the number of times the word \"love\" is used by an artist or in the context of the competition. But given the table only shows song titles, I think we have to stick with that.\n\nSo, based on the song titles provided:\n\n- \"ready for love\" uses \"love\" once.\n- \"chance to love you\" uses \"love\" once.\n\nTotal instances: two. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because the word \"love\" appears twice across different songs in the table.\n\nWait, but does each row represent a different song? Yes. So if there are two rows where the song title includes \"love,\" that's two times. Alternatively, if it were about the same song using \"love\" twice, that would be different, but here each is separate.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the word \"love\" appears in two different songs.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n   ]\n}",

Looking at the table, there are twelve rows, each representing an artist with their respective televote/sms percentages and places. My task is to check how many of these artists have a televote/sms percentage less than 2%.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1.

Row 4: Danny Milev - 2.39% \u2192 Just above 2%, so no.\n5. Row 5: Ivelina - 2.53% \u2192 Also just above, not counted.\n6. Row 6: Grafa - 3.91% \u2192 Above, skip.\n7.

Row 11: Krassimir Avramov - 55.52% \u2192 Way above, nope.\n12. Row 12: Nora - 5.75% \u2192 Above, skip.\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me double-check each to make sure I didn't miss anything. Sometimes it's easy to miscount or overlook a row.\n\nGoing back:\n\n- Rows with scores under 2% are rows 2 (0.37%) and row 10 (1.16%). That makes only two artists, not five as the claim suggests.\n\nSo, the claim states that five artists scored under 2%, but in reality, only two did. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to collect the relevant cells for these two artists to support my conclusion. Each of their entries includes the 'televote / sms' column, so those are the columns we need to reference.

Each time I checked an artist's name, that was a relevant cell. So, every row under the \"artist\" column is relevant because they all contribute to verifying if their names match Stefan.\n\nTherefore, all rows have the 'artist' column checked, but only two of them matched.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be a 70 percentage point difference between first and last place\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions a 70 percentage point difference. That's important because it's talking about the actual numerical difference in percentages, not a relative percentage difference. So I'm looking for two numbers where one is 70 points higher than the other when subtracted.\n\nNext, the claim refers to \"first and last place.\" From the table, I can see that each row represents an artist with their respective televote/sms percentages and their placement (place). The first place would be the highest percentage, and the last place would be the lowest percentage in this context since higher percentages indicate better performance.\n\nLooking at the table, let's identify the first and last places. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 1: televote/sms is 2.95%, place 7\n- Row 2: 0.37%, place 12\n- Row 3: 11.74%, place 2\n- Row 4: 2.39%, place 9\n- Row 5: 2.53%, place 8\n- Row 6: 3.91%, place 5\n- Row 7: 3.20%, place 6\n- Row 8: 8.45%, place 3\n- Row 9: 2.03%, place 10\n- Row 10: 1.16%, place 11\n- Row 11: 55.52%, place 1\n- Row 12: 5.75%, place 4\n\nSo, the first place is in row 11 with 55.52% televote/sms. The last place would be the smallest percentage, which looks to be row 2 at 0.37%.\n\nNow, let's calculate the difference between these two percentages. Subtracting 0.37 from 55.52 gives:\n\n55.52 - 0.37 = 55.15 percentage points.\n\nThe claim states a 70 percentage point difference. However, our calculation shows only a 55.15% difference. That's significantly less than 70. Therefore, the claim is not accurate based on the data provided.\n\nTo ensure I didn't miss anything, let me double-check if there are any other placements that might be considered as \"last.\" Looking again, row 2 has the lowest percentage at 0.37%, so it's definitely last. First place is indeed row 11 with 55.52%. No other rows have percentages that would create a higher difference.\n\nTherefore, since the actual difference is about 55.15 percentage points and not 70, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"2 song title be in english\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has rows numbered from 1 to 12, and each row contains information about a draw number, artist, song title, televote/SMS percentage, and place. The claim is about the number of English song titles, so I need to focus on the \"song\" column across all rows.\n\nI'll go through each song title one by one:\n\n1. Row 1: \"get up\" \u2013 This is in English.\n2. Row 2: \"razstoyaniya\" \u2013 Doesn't look like an English word; possibly Bulgarian.\n3. Row 3: \"one lifetime is not enough\" \u2013 Definitely English.\n4. Row 4: \"nyama vreme\" \u2013 Appears to be Bulgarian.\n5. Row 5: \"ready for love\" \u2013 English.\n6. Row 6: \"vrag\" \u2013 This seems like a foreign word, likely Bulgarian meaning \"devil.\"\n7. Row 7: \"don't kiss for the money\" \u2013 English.\n8. Row 8: \"crazy\" \u2013 English.\n9. Row 9: \"chance to love you\" \u2013 English.\n10. Row 10: \"everlasting\" \u2013 English.\n11. Row 11: \"illusion\" \u2013 English.\n12. Row 12: \"it's not right\" \u2013 English.\n\nWait, now I'm counting more than two English song titles. Let me recount:\n\n- Row 1: English\n- Row 3: English\n- Row 5: English\n- Row 7: English\n- Row 8: English\n- Row 9: English\n- Row 10: English\n- Row 11: English\n- Row 12: English\n\nThat's nine English song titles. The claim states that there are two, but clearly, more than that exist in the table. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to list all rows where the song title was checked. Each row's \"song\" column is examined, so every row from 1 to 12 has its \"song\" cell considered.\n\nSo, compiling this into the required JSON structure.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the winner have the longest song title",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine if the claim \"the winner have the longest song title\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll identify who the winner is from the table. Looking at each row, the column 'place' shows the rankings. The lowest number indicates a higher rank. So, row 11 has place: 1, which means that's the winning entry.\n\nNext, I need to find out what the song title of the winner is. From row 11, the artist is Krassimir Avramov and the song title is \"illusion\". \n\nNow, I have to check if this song title is indeed the longest among all entries. Let me list all the song titles:\n\n1. Get Up\n2. Razstoyaniya\n3. One Lifetime Is Not Enough\n4. Nyama Vreme\n5. Ready For Love\n6. Vrag\n7. Don't Kiss For The Money\n8. Crazy\n9. Chance To Love You\n10. Everlasting\n11. Illusion\n12. It's Not Right\n\nLooking at each title, \"One Lifetime Is Not Enough\" from row 3 seems quite long. Let me count the letters:\n\n- \"Get Up\" has 6 letters.\n- \"Razstoyaniya\" is longer; let's see: R-A-Z-S-T-O-Y-A-N-I-Y-A \u2013 that's 12 letters.\n- \"One Lifetime Is Not Enough\": O-n-e space L-i-f-e-t-i-m-e space I-s space N-o-t space E-n-o-u-g-h. If we count the letters without spaces, it's 23 letters (O-N-E-L-I-F-E-T-I-M-E-I-S-N-O-T-E-N-O-U-G-H). That's definitely longer.\n- \"Nyama Vreme\" is shorter, around 10 letters.\n- \"Ready For Love\" is about 14 letters.\n- \"Vrag\" is short.\n- \"Don't Kiss For The Money\" is quite long: D-O-N-'-T space K-I-S-S space F-O-R space T-H-E space M-O-N-E-Y. That's a lot, maybe around 20 letters without spaces.\n- \"Crazy\" is short.\n- \"Chance To Love You\": C-H-A-N-C-E space T-O space L-O-V-E space Y-O-U \u2013 about 17 letters.\n- \"Everlasting\" is 11 letters.\n- \"Illusion\" is 8 letters.\n- \"It's Not Right\" is around 12 letters.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the song titles accurately:\n\n- Row 3: One Lifetime Is Not Enough \u2013 that's definitely longer than most. Let's count it letter by letter without spaces and apostrophes. O-N-E-L-I-F-E-T-I-M-E-I-S-N-O-T-E-N-O-U-G-H. That's O (1), N (2), E (3), L (4), I (5), F (6), E (7), T (8), I (9), M (10), E (11), I (12), S (13), N (14), O (15), T (16), E (17), N (18), O (19), U (20), G (21), H (22). So 22 characters.\n\n- Row 7: Don't Kiss For The Money \u2013 D-O-N-'-T space K-I-S-S space F-O-R space T-H-E space M-O-N-E-Y. Without spaces and apostrophe, it's D-O-N-T-K-I-S-S-F-O-R-T-H-E-M-O-N-E-Y. Let me count: D(1), O(2), N(3), T(4), K(5), I(6), S(7), S(8), F(9), O(10), R(11), T(12), H(13), E(14), M(15), O(16), N(17), E(18), Y(19). So 19 characters.\n\nWait, I think I might have miscounted. Let me list them all properly:\n\nRow 3: \"One Lifetime Is Not Enough\" \u2013 breaking it down:\nO-n-e space L-i-f-e-t-i-m-e space I-s space N-o-t space E-n-o-u-g-h\nLetters only (without spaces): O, n, e, L, i, f, e, t, i, m, e, I, s, N, o, t, E, n, o, u, g, h \u2192 22 letters.\n\nRow 7: \"Don't Kiss For The Money\" \u2013 letters only (without apostrophe and spaces): D, O, N, T, K, I, S, S, F, O, R, T, H, E, M, O, N, E, Y \u2192 19 letters.\n\nSo Row 3 has a longer song title than Row 7. \n\nNow, the winner is in row 11 with \"Illusion\", which is only 8 letters. So the claim says that the winner (row 11) has the longest song title. But according to my analysis, row 3's song title is longer.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the winning song doesn't have the longest title; row 3 does.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the winner has the longest song title. The winner is in row 11 with the song \"Illusion\". However, examining all song titles, \"One Lifetime Is Not Enough\" from row 3 is significantly longer. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
