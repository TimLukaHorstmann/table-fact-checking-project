    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"from 1998 to 2009, manny pacquiao lack any defense 50% of the time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim means. It suggests that in the period from 1998 to 2009, Manny Pacquiao had no defenses in half of his title fights. So I need to check each row in the table for the 'defenses' column and see how many times he had zero defenses versus total number of rows.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: defenses = 1\nRow 2: defenses = 1\nRow 3: defenses = 4\nRow 4: defenses = 2\nRow 5: defenses = 0\nRow 6: defenses = 0\nRow 7: defenses = 0\nRow 8: defenses = 0\n\nWait, actually, let me count the rows correctly. The table has 8 rows (rows 1 to 8). Each row represents a different title and fight.\n\nNow, counting how many times defenses are zero:\n\nRows with defenses=0: Rows 5,6,7,8. That's four instances.\n\nTotal number of fights listed is 8.\n\nThe claim says he lacked any defense 50% of the time, which would mean 4 out of 8. So that matches exactly because 4/8 = 50%.\n\nSo the relevant cells are all rows where 'defenses' column has zero or non-zero values to assess the percentage.\n\nTherefore, each row's 'defenses' column is relevant because we need to count how many times defenses were zero versus total fights. So I'll include all 8 rows with their 'defenses' columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Manny Pacquiao lacked defenses in half of his fights from 1998 to 2009. Reviewing each fight, four out of eight had zero defenses, which is exactly 50%. Thus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out step by step. So the task is to determine whether the claim about Manny Pacquiao is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"Manny Pacquiao had his first TKO in a winning bout in 2001.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. A TKO stands for Technical Knockout, which means the fight was stopped by the referee because one fighter couldn't continue effectively. So the claim is stating that in 2001, Pacquiao had his first win via TKO.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists several rows with details about Pacquiao's fights. Each row has information like number, name, titles, date, opponent, result, and defenses. Since all rows have the same number (1) and name (Manny Pacquiao), I'll focus on the other columns.\n\nI need to find any entry where the result is a TKO and check if that was his first occurrence in 2001. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: The date is December 4, 1998. Result is KO (Knockout) in round 8 of 12. So this isn't a TKO, and the year is earlier than 2001.\n\nRow 2: Same as Row 1 but different title. Date is still 1998. Again, not relevant for the claim about 2001.\n\nRow 3: The date here is June 23, 2001. The result is TKO in round 6 of 12. This looks promising because it's a TKO and the year matches the claim. I'll note this as a potential first TKO.\n\nRow 4: Date is November 15, 2003. Result is TKO again but later than 2001. So even though it's another TKO win, since Row 3 is earlier in 2001, this isn't the first.\n\nRows 5 and 6: Both are on March 15, 2008. The result here is SD (Split Decision), not a KO or TKO. So these don't apply.\n\nRow 7: Date June 28, 2008. Result is TKO, but again after 2001.\n\nRow 8: May 2, 2009. Another TKO win, but still later than 2001.\n\nSo the only entry in 2001 with a TKO result is Row 3. That means this was Pacquiao's first TKO victory in that year as per the table. \n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be TRUE because Row 3 confirms a TKO win in 2001, and it's his earliest entry for such a result.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in Row 3 of the table, where Pacquiao achieved a TKO victory in 2001. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"manny pacquiao win more bout in 2008\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim means. It says that Manny Pacquiao won more bouts (fights) in the year 2008 than any other year mentioned in the table. So I need to count how many fights he had each year and see if 2008 has the highest number.\n\nLooking at the table, there are eight rows, all about Manny Pacquiao's wins. Each row represents a title win with details like date, opponent, result, etc.\n\nI'll go through each row and note the year of each bout:\n\n1. Row 1: Date is 1998-12-04 \u2192 Year 1998\n2. Row 2: Same as Row 1, so also 1998\n3. Row 3: Date is 2001-06-23 \u2192 Year 2001\n4. Row 4: Date is 2003-11-15 \u2192 Year 2003\n5. Row 5: Date is 2008-03-15 \u2192 Year 2008\n6. Row 6: Same as Row 5, so also 2008\n7. Row 7: Date is 2008-06-28 \u2192 Year 2008\n8. Row 8: Date is 2009-05-02 \u2192 Year 2009\n\nNow, let's count the number of bouts per year:\n\n- 1998: 2 bouts (Rows 1 and 2)\n- 2001: 1 bout (Row 3)\n- 2003: 1 bout (Row 4)\n- 2008: 3 bouts (Rows 5, 6, and 7)\n- 2009: 1 bout (Row 8)\n\nSo in 2008, Manny had three wins. Comparing this to other years, it's more than any other year listed here. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because he did have more bouts in 2008 compared to the other years shown.\n\nThe relevant cells are all the dates from each row, so I'll list them as row indices with column name \"date\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about Manny Pacquiao is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says he fought in 5 weight categories from 1998 to 2009. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and identify all the rows that involve Manny Pacquiao. Each row represents a fight with specific details like titles, dates, opponents, etc. Since all rows have his name, they're all relevant.\n\nNext, I need to focus on the 'titles' column because that tells me about the weight categories he fought in. Let's list out each title from the table:\n\n1. WBC Flyweight (112) - Row 1\n2. Lineal Flyweight (112) - Row 2\n3. IBF Super Bantamweight (122) - Row 3\n4. The Ring Featherweight (126) - Row 4\n5. WBC Super Featherweight (130) - Row 5\n6. The Ring Junior Lightweight (130) - Row 6\n7. WBC Lightweight (135) - Row 7\n8. The Ring Junior Welterweight (140) - Row 8\n\nWait, but I need to check if these are different weight categories or not. For instance, Flyweight appears twice (WBC and Lineal), but they're both at the same weight limit of 112. So that's still one category.\n\nLooking at the titles:\n\n- Flyweight (112): Rows 1 & 2\n- Super Bantamweight (122): Row 3\n- Featherweight (126): Row 4\n- Super Featherweight (130): Rows 5 & 6\n- Lightweight (135): Row 7\n- Junior Welterweight (140): Row 8\n\nSo that's a total of six different weight categories. But the claim says he fought in five. Hmm, did I count correctly?\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n1. Flyweight (112)\n2. Super Bantamweight (122)\n3. Featherweight (126)\n4. Super Featherweight (130)\n5. Lightweight (135)\n6. Junior Welterweight (140)\n\nYes, that's six categories. But maybe the claim is considering some as the same? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the weight classes.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me check each year and see how many times he moved up in weight. From 1998 to 2009, looking at the dates:\n\n- 1998: Flyweight\n- 2001: Super Bantamweight (higher than Flyweight)\n- 2003: Featherweight (higher than Super Bantam)\n- 2008: Super Featherweight and Junior Lightweight (same weight, different titles)\n- 2008 again: Lightweight\n- 2009: Junior Welterweight\n\nWait, so perhaps the confusion is between Super Featherweight and Junior Lightweight. They both are at 130, but different organizations. So that's still one category.\n\nSo from 1998 to 2009, he fought in:\n\nFlyweight (112), Super Bantam (122), Feather (126), Super Feather/Junior Light (130), Lightweight (135), and Junior Welter (140). That's six categories. So the claim says five, which would be false.\n\nWait, but maybe the two titles in 2008 are considered one category since they're both at 130? Let me see:\n\nIn Row 5: WBC Super Featherweight (130)\nRow 6: The Ring Junior Lightweight (130)\n\nYes, same weight limit. So that's still one category.\n\nSo the count is Flyweight (1), Super Bantam (2), Feather (3), Super Feather/Junior Light (4), Lightweight (5), Junior Welter (6). That makes six categories. Therefore, the claim of five is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Manny Pacquiao fought in 5 weight categories from 1998 to 2009. By examining the 'titles' column across all relevant rows, it's clear he competed in six different weight classes within this period. Thus, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"titles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"Manny Pacquiao have his biggest difference in final scoring point during his bout with Ricky Hatton.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. The claim is suggesting that in his fight against Ricky Hatton, Manny had the largest point difference in his scoring compared to other bouts listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different title, date, opponent, result, and defenses. For each bout, I should check the 'result' column because it shows how he won or lost and possibly the points involved.\n\nLet me go through each relevant row:\n\nRow 1: vs Chatchai Sasakul \u2013 Result is KO 8/12. This means he knocked out his opponent in the 8th round of a 12-round fight. The 'KO' result doesn't provide specific scoring points; it's a stoppage.\n\nRow 3: vs Lehlohonolo Ledwaba \u2013 Tko 6/12. Again, this is a technical knockout, so no detailed point scores here either.\n\nRow 4: vs Marco Antonio Barrera \u2013 Tko 11/12. Another stoppage win; points not specified.\n\nRow 5: vs Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez \u2013 SD 12/12. This stands for Split Decision, which means the judges had differing scores. However, the exact point difference isn't given here either.\n\nRow 6: Same as row 5, another split decision against the same opponent, but again no points provided.\n\nRow 7: vs David D\u00edaz \u2013 Tko 9/12. Another stoppage win without specific point data.\n\nRow 8: vs Ricky Hatton \u2013 Ko 2/12. This is a knockout in the second round. Again, no detailed scoring points are given; it's just that he won by KO.\n\nWait a minute. The table doesn't provide actual scoring points for any of these fights. It only gives the result type (KO, TKO, SD) and sometimes the round number. There's no numerical score differential mentioned anywhere in the table.\n\nSo, without specific point differentials listed, I can't compare which fight had the biggest difference. The claim is about the \"biggest difference in final scoring points,\" but the data doesn't include any scoring points at all. Therefore, there's no information to support or refute that the bout with Hatton was his biggest point differential.\n\nHence, based on the given table, I don't have enough information to confirm the claim as TRUE. Since the relevant cells (the 'result' column) don't contain the necessary data about scoring points, the answer must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break down the steps carefully.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"from 1998 to 2009, manny pacquiao lack any defense only 1 time.\" So, this means that during those years, there was only one instance where he didn't defend his title. In other words, in all other cases, he did have defenses except once.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different title and details about when he won it, who against, the result, etc. The key column here is \"defenses,\" which shows how many times he defended that title after winning it.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Row 1: WBC Flyweight, 1998-12-04, defenses = 1\n   - So, he had 1 defense here.\n\n2. Row 2: Lineal Flyweight, same date, defenses = 1\n   - Again, 1 defense.\n\n3. Row 3: IBF Super Bantamweight, 2001-06-23, defenses =4\n   - He defended this title four times.\n\n4. Row 4: The Ring Featherweight, 2003-11-15, defenses=2\n   - Two defenses here.\n\n5. Row 5: WBC Super Featherweight, 2008-03-15, defenses=0\n   - Zero defenses. This is one instance where he didn't defend the title.\n\n6.

Row8: The Ring Junior Welterweight, 2009-05-02, defenses=0\n   - Zero once more.\n\nNow, counting the number of times he had zero defenses:\n- Rows 5,6,7,8 all have 0 defenses. That's four instances where he didn't defend his titles.\n\nThe claim states that there was only one time when he lacked defenses, but according to the table, it happened four times between 1998 and 2009.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nThe claim says: \"Manny Pacquiao have his first TKO in a losing bout in 1998.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what each part means:\n- First TKO: The first time he was involved in a technical knockout (TKO) fight.\n- Losing bout: He lost that particular fight.\n- In 1998: This happened during the year 1998.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I'll check each row for relevant information about Manny Pacquiao's fights in 1998 and see if any of them are a TKO loss.\n\nStarting with Row 1:\n- Date is 1998-12-04.\n- Result is KO 8/12. So, it was a knockout, not a TKO. Also, the result isn't specified as a loss or win here, but since Manny Pacquiao is the name in all rows, I assume these are his wins.\n\nRow 2:\n- Same date as Row 1.\n- Also KO result, so same reasoning as above.\n\nRows beyond that have dates after 1998, so they can be ignored for this claim.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Are there any rows with TKO in the 'result' column?\n\nLooking at all rows:\nRow 3: Result is tko (TKO) but date is 2001.\nRow 4: tko result in 2003.\nRows 5 and 6: sd (split decision), not TKO.\nRow7: tko again, but in 2008.\nRow8: ko.\n\nSo the earliest TKO is in 2001, which is after 1998. Also, in 1998, the results were KO, not TKO. Moreover, all his fights listed here seem to be wins because he's gaining titles each time. So if it was a losing bout, maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, does 'result' indicate who won? Let me see:\n\n- In Row 1 and 2: result is KO in the 8th round of 12. Since Pacquiao got the title, he must have won.\n- In other rows, when it's a defense, but defenses are zero except for some rows.\n\nSo no, there's no TKO loss in 1998. The first TKO is in 2001, and it was a win because he's defending the title.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Manny Pacquiao had his first TKO in a losing bout in 1998 is FALSE because the table shows his earliest TKO result was in 2001, which was a win, and there were no TKOs in 1998.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"Manny Pacquiao won the most bouts in 2001\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row of the table and check for entries from the year 2001. The relevant columns are 'date' to find the year and 'result' to see if it's a win.\n\nRow 1: Date is December 4, 1998. That's not 2001.\nRow 2: Same date as Row 1, so also 1998.\nRow 3: June 23, 2001. This is the year we're interested in. The result here is TKO 6/12, which means he won by technical knockout in the 6th round of a 12-round bout. So this counts as a win.\nRow 4: November 15, 2003. Not relevant for 2001.\nRows 5-8 are all after 2008 or before 2009, so they don't fall into 2001.\n\nSo in 2001, Manny has one win according to the table. But wait, could there be more? The table only shows his title wins and defenses, but perhaps it's not listing all of his bouts, just the significant ones like title fights.\n\nThe claim says he \"won the most bouts\" in 2001. If the table doesn't show other bouts that year, we can't confirm if this was the highest number compared to other years. However, given only the information here, he has at least one win in 2001, but without knowing how many total bouts or comparing to other years, it's hard to say if it's the most.\n\nBut wait, maybe \"most\" refers to the majority of his wins that year. Since we only have this one win listed for 2001, perhaps that's considered the most he had in any single year based on the data provided. Alternatively, if other years have more wins but aren't shown here, then it would be false.\n\nGiven the table doesn't list all his bouts, just specific title fights, we might not have enough info. But since the claim is about 2001 and the only relevant entry is a win that year, maybe the answer is TRUE because he did have a significant bout there, but I'm not entirely sure if it's the \"most\".\n\nWait, another thought: The term \"won the most bouts\" could mean he had more wins than losses in 2001. But with only one listed result as a win, we don't know about other bouts or their outcomes that year. So without full data on all his bouts in 2001, it's impossible to confirm if he indeed won the most.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused. The claim might be FALSE because the table doesn't provide enough information to support that he had the highest number of wins in 2001 compared to other years. Alternatively, maybe it's TRUE based on the one win shown.\n\nBut since the instructions say to check each condition against the table and determine if fully supported, I think the answer is FALSE because we don't have enough data points about all his bouts in 2001 to confirm he won the most that year.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"Manny Pacquiao won the most bouts in 2001\" cannot be fully supported by the given table. The table only shows one bout for Manny in 2001, which was a win, but without information on all his bouts and results that year compared to other years, we can't confirm if it's the most.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"from 1998 to 2009 , manny pacquiao fought in the same weight category\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row of the table to see what weight categories Manny Pacquiao fought in during those years. The key columns here are \"date\" and \"titles\", specifically the weight category part indicated in parentheses after each title.\n\nLooking at Row 1: The date is 1998-12-04, which falls within the claim's timeframe. The title mentions WBC flyweight (112). So that's one category.\n\nRow 2 also has the same date as Row 1 and mentions lineal flyweight (112), so still flyweight.\n\nMoving to Row 3: Date is 2001-06-23. The title here is IBF super bantamweight (122). So now, he's fighting in a different weight category\u2014super bantamweight instead of flyweight. This change indicates that the claim might not hold because he's moving up in weight.\n\nRow 4: Date is 2003-11-15, and the title is The Ring featherweight (126). Another weight category, so definitely different from flyweight.\n\nRows 5 and 6 have dates in 2008. Row 5 is WBC super featherweight (130), and Row 6 is The Ring junior lightweight (130). These are both higher than his previous categories, showing progression.\n\nRow 7: Date is 2008-06-28 with the title WBC lightweight (135). Again, a different category.\n\nRow 8: Date is 2009-05-02, and the title is The Ring junior welterweight (140), which is another step up.\n\nSo, from 1998 to 2009, Manny fought in multiple weight categories: flyweight, super bantamweight, featherweight, super featherweight, lightweight, and junior welterweight. This shows that he didn't stay in the same category throughout; instead, he moved up as his career progressed.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because he competed in several different weight categories during that period.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"titles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim about Manny Pacquiao is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"Manny Pacquiao have the biggest difference in score point during his bout with Marco Antonio Barrera.\" \n\nFirst, I should parse the table to find all relevant information related to his bouts and their results. The key points here are the opponent, result type (like KO, TKO, SD), and possibly the score differences.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Opponent is Chatchai Sasakul, Result is KO 8/12\n- Row 2: Same as row 1 but different title.\n- Row 3: Opponent is Lehlohonolo Ledwaba, Result is TKO 6/12\n- Row 4: Opponent is Marco Antonio Barrera, Result is TKO 11/12\n- Row 5 and 6: Opponent Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez, Result SD 12/12\n- Row 7: David D\u00edaz, Result TKO 9/12\n- Row 8: Ricky Hatton, Result KO 2/12\n\nThe claim mentions the bout with Marco Antonio Barrera. Looking at row 4, the result is \"TKO 11/12\". The numbers after the result type (like 8/12) probably indicate the round in which it happened and the total rounds scheduled. But I'm not sure how this relates to score points.\n\nWait, TKO stands for technical knockout, which doesn't involve a score difference because the fight was stopped before completion due to injury or referee's decision. Similarly, KO means knockout, also no scores involved as the fight ended early.\n\nThe only result that mentions a score is \"sd 12/12\" in rows 5 and 6, which I believe stands for split decision. But in this case, the claim is about the biggest difference in score points during his bout with Barrera. \n\nSince the result against Barrera was a TKO, there wouldn't have been any official scores tallied because the fight ended early. Therefore, there's no score difference to compare. The claim might be confusing between different types of results and how they relate to scoring.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is FALSE because the bout with Barrera resulted in a TKO, which doesn't involve score points that could have a difference.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a score point difference during a specific bout. However, since the fight ended by TKO, there were no official scores tallied, meaning no score difference exists.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
