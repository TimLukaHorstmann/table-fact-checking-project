    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's see what I need to do here. The user has provided a table with several rows of data about football games in 1990. Each row includes details like week number, date, opponent, result, and attendance. They've made a claim that there are five games played in December with specific scores: w 23-20, w 38-31, w 24-7, w 28-24, and w 17-12. I need to determine if this claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table.\n\nFirst, I should identify all the rows where the date falls in December because the claim specifies that these games were played in December. Looking at the table, rows 12 through 16 have dates in December: weeks 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17.\n\nNext, I'll check the results of each of these December games to see if they match the scores mentioned in the claim. \n\n- Row 12 (week 13): Result is w 23-20\n- Row 13 (week 14): Result is w 38-31\n- Row 14 (week 15): Result is w 24-7\n- Row 15 (week 16): Result is w 28-24\n- Row 16 (week 17): Result is w 17-12\n\nNow, I'll list the results from these rows and compare them to the claim. The claim lists exactly five game scores, each corresponding to one of these December games. \n\nLooking at each score:\n- w 23-20 matches row 12\n- w 38-31 matches row 13\n- w 24-7 matches row 14\n- w 28-24 matches row 15\n- w 17-12 matches row 16\n\nEach of these scores is present in the table as per their respective rows. Therefore, all five games mentioned in the claim were indeed played in December with those exact scores.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are each result cell from rows 12 to 16. I'll list them accordingly to show which parts of the table support the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"in game 17, the Los Angeles Raiders play the San Diego Charger with a score of W 17 - 12 and attendance 62593.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a row in the table that corresponds to game number 17. Looking through the rows, I see that Row 16 has week: 17. So, that's our starting point.\n\nNext, let's verify each part of the claim against this row. \n\n1. **Opponent**: The claim mentions \"San Diego Charger.\" In Row 16, the opponent is listed as \"san diego chargers.\" The name matches except for capitalization and pluralization. Chargers vs. Charger \u2013 but I think it's acceptable since they're referring to the same team.\n\n2. **Result**: The claim states the result was \"W 17 - 12.\" In Row 16, the result is listed as \"w 17-12,\" which matches exactly except for the case of 'W' and the hyphen spacing. But that's minor; it clearly indicates a win with the same score.\n\n3. **Attendance**: The claim mentions attendance was 62593. Checking Row 16, the attendance is indeed 62593. That matches perfectly.\n\nHowever, there's something missing in the claim. It refers to \"the Los Angeles Raiders,\" but looking at the table, none of the rows mention \"Los Angeles Raiders.\" The team isn't listed as a participant in any game here; all opponents are other teams like Denver Broncos, Seattle Seahawks, etc., but never the Raiders.\n\nWait, that's odd. The user is talking about the Los Angeles Raiders playing against San Diego Chargers in week 17. But according to the table, the opponent in week 17 is San Diego Chargers, and the result was a win for whoever this team is (maybe another team like the Raiders? Or perhaps the table represents another team's schedule). \n\nBut since the claim specifically mentions \"Los Angeles Raiders,\" I need to confirm if that team is present in the table. Looking through all rows, opponents are Denver Broncos, Seattle Seahawks, Pittsburgh Steelers, etc., but there's no mention of Los Angeles Raiders as either the home or away team.\n\nSo, while the rest of the details (opponent, score, attendance) match Row 16, the claim incorrectly attributes the game to the Los Angeles Raiders. Since the table doesn't list the Raiders as a participant in any game, including week 17, the claim is not fully supported.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions \"Los Angeles Raiders,\" which isn't present in the table. The relevant cells match opponent, result, and attendance but lack information about the Raiders.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine whether a given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided data.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"when the score be l 9 -7 the week be 9 and the opponent be at kansas city chief\". \n\nBreaking it down:\n1. There's a game where the result was an 'L' (loss) with a score of 9-7.\n2. This game occurred in Week 9.\n3. The opponent for that game was the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nNow, I'll check each part against the table data to verify if all conditions are met.\n\nLooking through the rows of the table:\n- Row 8 corresponds to week 9. Let me examine the details there:\n   - Date: November 4, 1990\n   - Opponent: Kansas City Chiefs\n   - Result: L 9-7\n   - Attendance: 70,951\n\nSo, all three conditions in the claim are satisfied by this row:\n- The result is indeed a loss (L) with the score 9-7.\n- It took place in week 9.\n- The opponent was the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nSince all parts of the claim align perfectly with Row 8, the claim holds true.

The claim states: \"the highest attendance be 80156 in a game against the chicago bear on september 30  , 1990\".\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim into its components:\n\n1. Highest attendance: 80156\n2. Opponent: Chicago Bears\n3. Date: September 30, 1990\n\nI'll need to check each of these points against the table.\n\nLooking at the table rows one by one:\n\nRow 4:\n- Week 4\n- Date: September 30, 1990\n- Opponent: Chicago Bears\n- Result: W 24 -10\n- Attendance: 80156\n\nSo, according to row 4, the attendance on that date against the Chicago Bears was indeed 80156.\n\nNow, I need to check if this is the highest attendance in the entire table. Let's go through all rows and look at the attendance numbers:\n\nRow 1: 54206\nRow 2: 61889\nRow 3: 50657\nRow 4: 80156\nRow 5: 80076\nRow 6: 50624\nRow 7: 60569\nRow 8: 70951\nRow 9: 50855\nRow 10: 70553\nRow 11: 65710\nRow 12: 74162\nRow 13: 72190\nRow 14: 54132\nRow 15: 53899\nRow 16: 62593\n\nLooking through these numbers, the highest attendance is 80156 in row 4. The next highest is 80076 in row 5, which is slightly lower.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are correct:\n- The attendance was 80156.\n- It was against the Chicago Bears.\n- The date was September 30, 1990.\n- And it's indeed the highest attendance in the table.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"week 8 do not have a game or opponent but week 10 have a game on november 11, 1990 with opponent green bay packer.\"\n\nFirst, I'll check if there's any data for week 8 in the table. Looking through the rows, the weeks listed are 1 to 17, except I notice that row 8 is actually week 9. That means the table skips from week 4 (row 4) to week 6 (row 5), and then continues normally after that. Wait, no, let me recount. Rows 1-4 correspond to weeks 1-4. Then row 5 is week 5, row 6 is week 6, row 7 is week 7, row 8 is week 9, row 9 is week 10, and so on. So there's no data for week 8 at all in the table provided.\n\nNext, checking week 10: according to the claim, it should have a game on November 11, 1990 against Green Bay Packers. Looking at row 9 (since rows are zero-indexed or one-indexed? Wait, the example shows \"row_index\": 0 which refers to first row as index 0, so I think rows start at 0). Let me confirm: Row 1 is week 1, so row indexes go from 0 to 15 (since there are 16 rows). So for week 10, that's row 9.\n\nIn row 9 (week 10), the date is November 11, 1990, and the opponent is Green Bay Packers. The result is a loss with score 29-16. So yes, week 10 does have a game as per the table.\n\nTherefore, since week 8 doesn't exist in the table (no row for it), the first part of the claim is true, and the second part about week 10 is also true based on the data. Hence, the entire claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"In game 12, the Los Angeles Raiders play Kansas City Chiefs with a score of W 27-24 and attendance 65710.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim to see if it matches the table data. The table has rows from week 1 to week 17, so game 12 would correspond to row index 11 (since we start counting from 0). Let me check that row.\n\nLooking at Row 12 (index 11) in the table:\n- Week: 12\n- Date: November 25, 1990\n- Opponent: Kansas City Chiefs\n- Result: L 27 - 24\n- Attendance: 65710\n\nNow, let's verify each part of the claim against this row.\n\n1. **Game Number**: The claim mentions \"game 12\". In the table, Row 12 is game number 12 (since week 12 is the twelfth week). So that matches.\n\n2. **Team Playing**: The Raiders are not explicitly mentioned in the table; instead, the opponent is listed as \"Kansas City Chiefs\". However, since all rows list opponents, it's implied that the home team is the Los Angeles Raiders. But I should confirm if the claim specifies both teams or just one. The claim mentions \"the Los Angeles Raiders play Kansas City Chiefs\", which aligns with the table showing the opponent as Chiefs.\n\n3. **Score**: The claim states \"W 27 - 24\". In the table, the result is \"L 27 - 24\", meaning a loss for the home team (Raiders). So the score in the claim is presented as a win with 27-24, but the table shows it's a loss. This is a discrepancy.\n\n4. **Attendance**: The claim says attendance was 65710, which exactly matches the table's value for that row (attendance: 65710). So this part is correct.\n\nHowever, there's a contradiction in the result. The claim states it was a win (\"W\"), but the table shows it as a loss (\"L\"). Therefore, the overall claim isn't fully supported by the data because the outcome doesn't match.\n\nSo, even though attendance and opponent are correct, the incorrect result makes the entire statement false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly reports the game's result.

The claim says, \"the highest attendance be 80076 in a game against the buffalo bill on october 7, 1990.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check each part of this statement against the table provided. So, let's break it down into three parts: the attendance figure, the opponent, and the date.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple rows with different weeks, dates, opponents, results, and attendances. Let me go through each row one by one to find any that match October 7, 1990.\n\nRow 5 has a date of October 7, 1990. The opponent is the Buffalo Bills, which matches the claim. Now, checking the attendance for this game: it's listed as 80076. So, that part also matches the claim.\n\nNext, I need to verify if this is indeed the highest attendance in the entire table. Let's look through all the attendance numbers:\n\n- Row 1: 54206\n- Row 2: 61889\n- Row 3: 50657\n- Row 4: 80156\n- Row 5: 80076\n- Row 6: 50624\n- Row 7: 60569\n- Row 8: 70951\n- Row 9: 50855\n- Row 10: 70553\n- Row 11: 65710\n- Row 12: 74162\n- Row 13: 72190\n- Row 14: 54132\n- Row 15: 53899\n- Row 16: 62593\n\nLooking at these numbers, the highest attendance is in Row 4 with 80156. That's higher than 80076 from Row 5. So while the attendance on October 7 was high, it wasn't the highest of the season because there's a higher number in Row 4.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"the highest attendance be 80076\" is incorrect because 80156 is higher. However, the specific game against Buffalo Bills on that date did have an attendance of 80076, but it's not the highest overall.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the highest attendance was 80076 on October 7 against the Buffalo Bills.

Let me check row 9: Week 10, Opponent Green Bay Packers, Result L 29-16. The score here is 29-16, so not 9-7. So the opponent isn't San Diego either.\n\nI'm trying to see if there's any week where all three conditions meet:\n- Score 9-7\n- Week 10\n- Opponent San Diego Chargers\n\nFrom what I can tell, row 8 has the score but wrong week and opponent. Row 16 has the right opponent but wrong score and week. There's no entry in week 10 with a 9-7 score against San Diego. Therefore, the claim doesn't hold because all three conditions aren't met in any single row.\n\nSo, I think the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies that when the score is 9-7, it should occur in week 10 against the San Diego Chargers. Checking each condition:\n\n- **Score 9-7**: Found in Row 8 (Week 9 vs. Kansas City Chiefs).\n- **Week 10**: No row has a score of 9-7.\n- **Opponent San Diego Chargers**: Occurs in Rows 7 and 16, but with different scores.\n\nThus, no single row meets all three conditions.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"botk week 8 and 10 didn't have a game or opponent.\" First off, I notice there's a typo in \"botk\" \u2013 probably meant to be \"both\". So the claim is that both weeks 8 and 10 did not have any games or opponents.\n\nLooking at the table provided, let me check each week. The table has rows from week 1 to week 17, but I need to focus on weeks 8 and 10.\n\nStarting with week 8: Scanning through the rows, I don't see a row where the \"week\" is 8. The first few weeks go up to week 7, then jump to week 9. So there's no entry for week 8. That means week 8 didn't have any game or opponent listed here.\n\nNow checking week 10: Looking through the rows, I see a row with \"week\": 10. The details are date: november 11, 1990, opponent: green bay packers, result: l 29-16, attendance: 50855. So week 10 definitely had a game against the Green Bay Packers.\n\nSo the claim says both weeks didn't have games, but week 10 did. Therefore, the claim is false because while week 8 didn't have a game, week 10 did. \n\nThe relevant cells are for week 8 (which isn't present) and week 10's opponent. For week 10, row index 9 has the opponent information.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
