The claim is: \"the game play against the slough jet on the 2nd be attend by 320 fan.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should parse the claim correctly. It mentions a game against \"slough jets\" (I think that's a typo for \"jet\" but it probably refers to the team named Slough Jets). The date is the 2nd, and the attendance was 320 fans. So my task is to check if there's a row in the table where the opponent is Slough Jets on the 2nd with an attendance of 320.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 1: Date 1st, Opponent Slough Jets. Not relevant because it's not the 2nd.\nRow 2: Date 2nd, Opponent Slough Jets. This seems relevant. The result is lost 5-6 (OT), and attendance is 320. So that matches the claim.\n\nWait, but in Row 2, the opponent is Slough Jets on the 2nd with an attendance of 320. That's exactly what the claim says. Therefore, the claim is supported by this row.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows that might match to ensure no mistakes. Let me look through all the rows quickly:\n\nRow 3: Opponent Swindon Wildcats on the 8th.\nRow 4: Same opponent but home game on 9th.\nRows 5-11 don't mention Slough Jets except Row 1 and 2.\n\nSo only Row 2 matches both the date and opponent.

It seems to suggest that Wightlink Raiders were an opponent in a home game. So, I'm looking for any row where the opponent is Wightlink Raiders and the venue is Home.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- Row 8: Opponent is \"wightlink raiders\", Venue is \"away\". So this doesn't fit because it's an away game.\n- The other rows mention different opponents like Slough Jets, Swindon Wildcats, etc., but none of them have Wightlink Raiders as the opponent in a home game.\n\nWait, actually, I need to double-check all rows for any occurrence where \"opponent\" is Wightlink Raiders and \"venue\" is Home.

To verify this, I need to look at all rows where the venue is 'away' and check if any of those have a result of 2-3.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 11 rows (indexed from 0 to 10). Let's go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Opponent Slough Jets, Venue Home, Result Lost 2-3. Since it's a home match, this doesn't fit the claim.\n2. **Row 1**: Opponent Slough Jets, Venue Away, Result Lost 5-6 (OT). The result is 5-6, not 2-3. So, no match here.\n3. **Row 2**: Opponent Swindon Wildcats, Venue Away, Result Won 6-3. This isn't a loss and the score doesn't match.\n4. **Row 3**: Home against Swindon, result is 4-2. Not an away match.\n5. **Row 4**: Away vs Sheffiled Scimitars, won 7-4. Doesn't fit.\n6. **Row 5**: Home against Milton Keynes, lost 2-4. No, not away.\n7. **Row 6**: Home against Romford Raiders, won 6-2. Not relevant.\n8. **Row 7**: Away vs Wightlink Raiders, lost 5-4. Still not 2-3.\n9. **Row 8**: Home against Telford Tigers, result 4-2. Doesn't matter as it's home.\n10. **Row 9**: Home against Romford, won 7-2. Not away.\n11. **Row 10**: Away against Bracknell Bees, won 4-0. The score doesn't match.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed something. Let me double-check. The claim is about an away match with a result of 2-3. So I'm looking for 'venue' as 'away' and 'result' as 2-3.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Row 1: Away vs Slough, lost 5-6 (OT). Not 2-3.\n- Row 2: Away vs Swindon Wildcats, won 6-3. But this is a win, not a loss, and the score is 6-3, which isn't 2-3.\n- Row 4: Away vs Sheffiled, won 7-4. Again, doesn't match.\n- Row 7: Away vs Wightlink, lost 5-4. Still not 2-3.\n\nSo none of the away matches have a result of 2-3. The only row with a 2-3 result is Row 0, which is a home game. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by any away match in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that an away match resulted in a 2-3 score.

The claim says: \"the league / cup competition, play against the swindon wildcat, be lost 4 - 2 with neil liddiard name as man of the match.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down each part of the claim and check it against the table.\n\n1. **Competition**: The claim mentions \"league / cup.\" Looking at the table, all rows have either \"league\" or \"cup\" in the competition column. So that's a general condition, not specific to any row yet.\n\n2. **Opponent**: The opponent is Swindon Wildcats. I'll scan through each row to find where the opponent is Swindon Wildcats.\n\n- Row 3: Opponent is Swindon Wildcats, venue away, result won 6-3.\n- Row 4: Opponent is Swindon Wildcats again, but this time at home, and the result was a win 4-2. Wait, no\u2014looking closely, row 4's result is \"won 4 - 2,\" so it's a win.\n\nWait, hold on\u2014the claim says they were \"lost\" with that score. So in the table, both matches against Swindon are wins, not losses. That might be an issue because if the claim states a loss, but in reality it was a win, then part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss any other rows. Rows 1-4 mention Swindon, and both were wins. The rest don't have Swindon as opponents. So no row where they lost to Swindon with that score.\n\nWait, but looking again at the table:\n\nRow 3: Away vs Swindon, won 6-3.\nRow 4: Home vs Swindon, won 4-2.\n\nSo both were wins. The claim says \"be lost 4 - 2,\" which doesn't match any rows for that opponent.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misreading the claim. Let me read it again: \"the league / cup competition, play against the swindon wildcat, be lost 4 - 2 with neil liddiard name as man of the match.\"\n\nWait, maybe the row where Neil Liddiard is Man of the Match is Row 4, which was a win.

Let me check all rows again:\n\n- Rows 1: Opponent Slough Jets, lost 2-3.\n- Row 2: Slough Jets away, lost 5-6 OT.\n- Row 3: Swindon away, won 6-3.\n- Row4: Swindon home, won 4-2. Man of the match Neil Liddiard.\n\nSo yes, in row 4, they played against Swindon at home, won 4-2, and Neil was M.O.M. The claim says it was a loss with that score, so it's incorrect on two counts: result (loss vs win) and maybe even the opponent if I misread.\n\nWait, but in row 4, the result is \"won 4 - 2,\" not lost. So the claim states they were \"lost\" which contradicts that.\n\nBut let me double-check\u2014could there be another match against Swindon where they lost? From rows 1-10, only rows 3 and 4 are against Swindon, both wins.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because:\n\na) The result was a win, not a loss.\nb) The score in row 4 is 4-2 (win), so claiming a loss with that exact score is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, if there's a typo in the claim and they meant \"won,\" but as per the given claim, it says \"be lost.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the match against Swindon Wildcats where Neil Liddiard was M.O.M. resulted in a win, not a loss.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that against Swindon Wildcats in the league/cup competition, they lost 4-2 with Neil Liddiard as man of the match.

The claim states: \"the man of the match against the slough jet on the 2nd be lukas smital.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim:\n\n1. **Opponent**: Slough Jets\n2. **Date**: 2nd\n3. **Man of the Match**: Lukas Smital\n\nI'll check each row in the table to find the match that fits these criteria.\n\nLooking at Row 1:\n- Date: 1st, Opponent: Slough Jets\nThis doesn't match because the date is the 1st, not the 2nd.\n\nRow 2:\n- Date: 2nd, Opponent: Slough Jets\nThis matches both the opponent and the date. Now, checking who was named Man of the Match here: Paul Dixon. So, it's Paul, not Lukas Smital.\n\nRows beyond that have different opponents or dates, so they don't apply.\n\nSince on the 2nd against Slough Jets, the Man of the Match was Paul Dixon, not Lukas Smital, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"man of the match\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
