The relevant columns here are \"rank\" and \"nation\".\n\nThe claim is stating that Australia is not ranked first place. So, my task is to check if Australia's rank is indeed higher than 1.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: Rank 1 is Canada.\n- Row 2: Rank 2 is Australia.\n- Row 3: Also Rank 2 is Netherlands.\n- Rows 4 and 5 are both Rank 4, United States and Japan respectively.\n\nSo, Australia is in row 2 with a rank of 2. The first place (rank 1) is Canada. Therefore, the claim that \"Australia be not the nation that rank in first place\" is correct because Australia isn't ranked first; they're second.\n\nTo verify this, I need to check the relevant cells. For Australia's information, it's in row 2 where both the nation and rank are specified. The nation column confirms it's Australia, and the rank column shows they're at position 2.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE because Australia isn't ranked first.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nation\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Each row represents a country's performance in terms of medals won.\n\nThe claim says that there are four nations that didn't receive any gold medals.

Let me list them:\n\n1. Canada - 2 golds (has a gold)\n2. Australia - 0 (no gold)\n3. Netherlands - 0 (no gold)\n4. USA - 0 (no gold)\n5. Japan - 0 (no gold)\n\nSo, out of five nations listed, four have zero gold medals.
