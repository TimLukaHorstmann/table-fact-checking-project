    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. The claim is that \"217 be the lowest 1st lbsc number with a lbsc name of granville.\" So I need to verify if 217 is indeed the smallest '1st lbsc' number corresponding to the 'lbsc name' Granville.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each column means. The table has columns like \"row_index\", \"1st lbsc\", and \"lbsc name\". It looks like each row represents a specific entry with an assigned number in the first lbsc column and a corresponding name in the lbsc name column.\n\nThe claim is about finding the lowest '1st lbsc' number where the 'lbsc name' is Granville. So I need to search through all rows where 'lbsc name' is Granville and check their '1st lbsc' numbers. Then, determine if 217 is indeed the smallest among them.\n\nLooking at the data provided:\n\n- Row 34: 1st lbsc is 218, lbsc name is Beaconsfield\n- Row 35: 1st lbsc is 219, lbsc name is Cleveland\n- Then there's a jump to row 37 (since rows 0-36 are given) with 1st lbsc numbers continuing. Wait, looking back, actually in the provided data, I don't see Granville listed except perhaps elsewhere?\n\nWait, let me check all rows:\n\nRow 32: 1st lbsc is 216, name Granville.\n\nSo row 32 has 1st lbsc number 216 and lbsc name Granville. Then, if I'm looking for the lowest '1st lbsc' with name Granville, that would be 216 in row 32. But the claim says it's 217.\n\nWait, is there another entry? Let me check all rows again:\n\nLooking through each row, in row 32: 1st lbsc is 216, name Granville.\n\nRow 34: 218, Beaconsfield\n\nRow 35: 219, Cleveland\n\nRow 33: 217, Northcote (wait, no, row 33's name is Northcote)\n\nWait, let me make sure:\n\nRow 33: 1st lbsc 217, lbsc name Northcote.\n\nSo that would be another entry with 217 as the number but for a different name. So in row 32, Granville is at 216, which is lower than 217.\n\nWait, so if there's a 'Granville' at 216 and another at maybe 217? Or does Granville only appear once?\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 32: 1st lbsc 216, name Granville.\n\nIs there another row with the same name? Let me check all rows from 0 to 36:\n\n- Row 32: Granville at 216\n- No other 'Granville' names in other rows. So the lowest '1st lbsc' number for Granville is 216.\n\nBut the claim says it's 217, which would be incorrect because there's a lower number (216) associated with Granville. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that 217 is the lowest '1st lbsc' number for Granville, but according to the table, row 32 has 'Granville' at 216, which is lower.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"1st lbsc\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"lbsc name\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
