    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"marc surer score 4 more point in 1985 compare to 1984\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions Marc Surer scoring 4 more points in 1985 compared to 1984. So, I need to check Marc Surer's points for both years and see if the difference is indeed 4 points.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a team entry with details like year, entrant, chassis, engine, and points. However, I notice that there's no information about drivers in the table; all entries are listed by the team names without specifying individual drivers. This means I don't have data on which driver scored how many points for each team.\n\nSince the claim is about Marc Surer specifically, but the table doesn't include any driver names, it's impossible to verify his exact points from 1984 and 1985 using this data. Without knowing which teams he drove for in those years or their corresponding points, I can't calculate the difference.\n\nMoreover, even if I look at the points scored by teams in those years, like Row 10 showing 1 point for Barlsey Nordica Arrows BMW in 1984 and Row 11 showing 5 points for Motor Racing Developments Ltd in 1985, there's no way to attribute these points directly to Marc Surer. The table doesn't link drivers to their teams or the points they earned.\n\nTherefore, without specific driver information tied to each entry, I can't confirm whether Marc Surer scored 4 more points in 1985 than in 1984. This makes it impossible to verify the claim as TRUE; hence, it must be FALSE based on the given data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be verified because the table lacks driver-specific information linking Marc Surer to his points in each year.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"Marc Surer scored a total of 5 points in both 1985 and 1986\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, there are rows from 1979 to 1986. Each row has details like year, entrant, chassis, engine, and points. The claim mentions Marc Surer, but I don't see any column in the table that lists drivers or individuals; it only goes up to 'points'. So, does this mean that each entry represents a team's performance, not individual drivers?\n\nThe claim refers to both 1985 and 1986. Let me check those years in the table.\n\nFor 1985 (Row 11), the entrant is \"motor racing developments ltd\", chassis is \"brabham bt54\", engine is \"bmw str-4 t/c\", and points are 5. \n\nIn 1986 (Row 12), the entrant is \"barclay arrows bmw\", chassis is \"arrows a8\", engine is \"bmw str-4 t/c\", and points are 0.\n\nThe claim says Marc Surer scored 5 points in both years. However, from the table, in 1986, the team got 0 points. So if Marc was part of that team, his points would have been included in the team's total. But since the team had 0 points, unless he scored individually beyond what's listed here, which isn't shown, it doesn't add up.\n\nWait, but maybe Marc Surer drove for different teams in those years? The table shows different entrants for 1985 and 1986. In 1985, the team is \"motor racing developments ltd\", and in 1986, it's \"barclay arrows bmw\". So if Marc was driving for both teams, would his points be split between them?\n\nLooking at the points: 1985 has 5 points, 1986 has 0. If he scored all 5 points in 1985 and none in 1986, the total across both years would be 5. But the claim says \"a total of 5 point in both 1985 and 1986\", which might imply 5 each year or a combined total. The wording is a bit unclear.\n\nBut regardless, the table only shows team points. Without specific driver data, we can't confirm individual contributions. So, since Marc Surer isn't mentioned in the table at all, and the points are per team, not per driver, we don't have enough info to verify if he scored 5 points each year or a total of 5 across both.\n\nTherefore, the claim can't be supported by the given data, so it's FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"marc surer score 4 point 1 time less than he score 0 point\" is true or false based on the given table. First off, I notice that the table doesn't mention any drivers' names, just entrants, chassis, engines, and points for each year from 1979 to 1986.\n\nThe claim is about Marc Surer's scores: specifically, whether he scored 4 points once less than he scored 0 points. But since the table doesn't list any drivers, only teams and their point totals, I can't directly link Marc Surer to any of these entries. Maybe Marc Surer drove for one of these teams in those years? That's possible, but without explicit data linking him to specific rows, it's impossible to verify.\n\nLooking at the points column: in 1979 and some other years like 1980, there are zeros. In 1981, two entries have 4 points each, 1982 has 3 points twice, 1983 has 4 again, and so on. So overall, the team points vary but without driver info.\n\nSince Marc Surer isn't mentioned in the table, I can't determine how many times he scored 4 or 0 points. Therefore, the claim can't be verified with the given data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be evaluated because the table does not include information about individual drivers like Marc Surer; it only provides team and point totals.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"marc surer score the same amount of point in both race in 1981\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the claim and then checking the relevant data.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions Marc Surer and his points in races from 1981. The question is whether he scored the same amount of points in both races that year.\n\nLooking at the table, I see entries for the year 1981. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 4: Year 1981, Entrant is ensign racing, Chassis ensign n180b, Engine cosworth v8, Points 4.\nRow 5: Year 1981, Entrant is theodore racing team, Chassis theodore ty01, Engine cosworth v8, Points 4.\n\nSo in 1981, there are two entries with points. Each has 4 points. The claim says Marc Surer scored the same amount of points in both races that year. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if both these rows are related to Marc Surer. The table only provides information about entrants, chassis, engine, and points, but it doesn't mention drivers or specific names like Marc Surer.\n\nSo without knowing who was driving each car, I can't confirm if both entries correspond to Marc Surer's performances. If the claim is about him scoring 4 points in two different races, but I don't have data linking these rows specifically to him, then the table doesn't support the claim.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, the claim isn't supported because there's no mention of Marc Surer in the table. The relevant cells are just the points from the 1981 entries.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not include information about Marc Surer or specifically link him to any points scored in 1981. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"marc surer score a total of 8 points in the 2 race of 1981\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, it has entries from 1979 to 1986 with various teams and their performance data like chassis, engine, and points scored each year. The claim mentions \"marc surer,\" but I notice that none of the rows in the table include any driver names; they only list entrants (teams), chassis details, engines, and points. So, there's no mention of \"marc surer\" anywhere in this data.\n\nNext, let's focus on the years mentioned in the claim. The claim is about 1981. Looking at rows 4 and 5, both are from 1981. Each has points scored: 4 for ensign racing and 4 for theodore racing team. So, combined, these two teams scored a total of 8 points in 1981.\n\nHowever, since the claim specifically mentions \"marc surer,\" I need to see if there's any information linking him to these points. The table doesn't provide driver details, only team entries. Without knowing which drivers were part of each team or their individual contributions, it's impossible to attribute those 8 points solely to marc surer.\n\nTherefore, while the total points in 1981 sum up to 8 across two races (assuming each row represents a race), we can't confirm if marc surer was responsible for all or any of those points. The claim doesn't have enough supporting information from the table since marc surer isn't mentioned.\n\nSo, even though the total points add up, without knowing who earned them, the claim isn't fully supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions a driver not listed in the table and refers to points scored by teams, but without driver-specific info, we can't verify if marc surer scored those points. Thus, it's FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"marc surer score 2 time as many point in 1986 than 1983\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Marc Surer scored twice as many points in 1986 compared to 1983. So, I need to check the points he earned in those two years from the table.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has information about a team's performance in a specific year. The columns include 'year', 'entrant', 'chassis', 'engine', and 'points'. \n\nI'll start by finding all rows where Marc Surer is mentioned. Wait, actually, looking through the rows, I don't see any mention of Marc Surer in the entrant column or anywhere else. That's a bit confusing because if he's not listed as an entrant in any year, then how can we determine his points? Maybe the entrant names include team names that he was part of?\n\nWait a second, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The table lists teams and their points each year. So, Marc Surer would have been part of one of these teams, but the table doesn't specify individual drivers; it just shows the team's total points for each year.\n\nSo, if I look at 1983, which row is that? Let me check: Row 8 is 1983, entrant Arrows Racing Team, chassis Arrows A6, engine Cosworth V8, points 4. So in 1983, the team scored 4 points.\n\nThen, looking at 1986: Row 12 is year 1986, entrant Barclay Arrows BMW, chassis Arrows A8, engine BMW STR-4T/C, points 0. So in 1986, the team scored 0 points.\n\nThe claim says that Marc Surer's points in 1986 were twice as much as in 1983. But according to the table, in 1983, the team (and presumably Marc if he was driving) had 4 points. In 1986, the same or another team associated with him scored 0 points.\n\nSo, mathematically, twice 4 is 8, but in 1986, it's 0, which isn't equal to 8. Therefore, the claim is not true based on the data provided.\n\nI should also consider if Marc Surer was part of a different team in either year that isn't listed here. But from the given table, there are no other entries for those years beyond what I've checked. So unless he drove for another team not mentioned here, but since the claim is about points scored by him through these teams, and according to this table, both 1983 and 1986 don't support the claim.\n\nWait, perhaps the point values are per car or per entrant? But each row represents an entrant, so if a team had multiple chassis in a year, like Arrows in 1982 with A4 and A5, both scoring 3 points. So total for the team would be 6 points in that case. But in 1983, only one entry: 4 points. In 1986, also just one entry: 0.\n\nSo Marc Surer's points in 1986 (0) versus twice as much as 1983 (4). That would mean 0 vs 8, which is not true.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cells are the points for 1983 and 1986.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Marc Surer's team scored 0 points in 1986 compared to 4 points in 1983, which doesn't satisfy the condition of being twice as many.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine whether the claim \"marc surer score 6 point 2 time more than he score 2 point in total\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the claim. It seems a bit unclear due to possible translation issues. Let me parse it carefully: \"marc surer score 6 point 2 time more than he score 2 point in total.\" So, maybe the intended meaning is that Marc Surer scored 6 points twice as much as he scored 2 points in total? Or perhaps it's saying he scored 6 points two times more than his previous score of 2 points. Alternatively, maybe it's stating that he achieved a certain number of points with a ratio involved.\n\nLooking at the table, I see entries from 1979 to 1986 for various teams and their performances. Each row includes year, entrant (team), chassis, engine, and points scored. However, there is no column for drivers or specific individuals like Marc Surer. All the rows list the team's total points, not individual driver points.\n\nSo, without any information about individual drivers in the table, it's impossible to verify anything about Marc Surer's points.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions Marc Surer scoring the same number of points in three races in 1982. However, looking at the table provided, I don't see any mention of drivers' names\u2014only entrants, chassis, engines, and points. So the first thing that comes to mind is whether the table includes information about individual drivers like Marc Surer.\n\nLooking through each row of the table:\n\n- Rows 1 to 3 are from years 1979, 1980, 1980.\n- Rows 4 and 5 are from 1981.\n- Rows 6 and 7 are from 1982. These are for Arrows Racing Team with chassis A4 and A5, both using Cosworth V8 engines and scoring 3 points each.\n- Rows 8 to 12 cover years 1983 to 1986.\n\nSince the claim is about 1982, I focus on rows 6 and 7. Each of these entries has 3 points. However, the table doesn't specify how many races each entrant participated in or who drove for them. Without driver names listed, there's no way to attribute the points to Marc Surer specifically.\n\nMoreover, the claim refers to three races where Marc scored the same amount of points. The table only shows two entries for 1982, both with 3 points each. It doesn't provide data on individual races or drivers' performances beyond the team level.\n\nTherefore, without information about Marc Surer's participation or his specific point contributions in those races, I can't verify the claim.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the claim. It mentions Marc Surer, who I assume is a driver, scoring a total of 9 points across 4 races in the year 1982. My task is to check if the data in the table supports this.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an entry for a particular year with details about the team, chassis, engine, and points scored. The claim is about 1982, so I'll focus on rows from that year.\n\nIn the table provided, there are two entries for the year 1982:\n\n- Row 6: Arrows Racing Team with chassis Arrows A4, Cosworth V8 engine, points 3.\n- Row 7: Arrows Racing Team with chassis Arrows A5, Cosworth V8 engine, points 3.\n\nSo in total for 1982, the team scored 3 + 3 = 6 points across two races. The claim states that Marc Surer scored a total of 9 points in 4 races. \n\nWait a minute, I'm noticing something here. The table only shows entries for Arrows Racing Team in 1982 with a total of 6 points. However, the claim mentions Marc Surer specifically. The table doesn't list individual drivers; it lists teams and their points. So unless Marc Surer was part of one of these entries, we can't directly link his points to the team's points.\n\nBut from the data given, there are only two races for Arrows in 1982, totaling 6 points. The claim says 4 races with 9 points. That's a discrepancy because the table shows fewer races and points than claimed.\n\nAdditionally, I don't see any mention of Marc Surer in the table at all. Each row lists the entrant (team) but not individual drivers. Without specific driver information, we can't attribute points to Marc Surer directly from this data.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided table, there's no evidence supporting that Marc Surer scored 9 points in 4 races in 1982.
