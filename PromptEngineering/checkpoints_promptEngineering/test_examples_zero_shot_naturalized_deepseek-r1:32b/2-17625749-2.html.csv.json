The claim mentions two clubs: pontyclun rfc and cilfynydd rfc. It states that pontyclun has more points than cilfynydd for the 20 games they played.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see columns like \"played\", \"points\", etc. So I need to check both the number of games each club played and their respective points.\n\nStarting with pontyclun rfc:\n- From Row 2: They played 20 games.\n- Their points are listed as 86.\n\nNow, for cilfynydd rfc:\n- From Row 3: They also played 20 games (so the number of games is the same).\n- Their points are listed as 74.\n\nComparing the points: pontyclun has 86 and cilfynydd has 74. Clearly, 86 is more than 74, so the claim holds true.\n\nTo make sure I didn't miss anything, I'll check other relevant cells. Both clubs have \"played\":20, which matches the claim's condition of 20 games. Their points are directly compared, and there's no mention of other factors like try bonuses or losing bonuses affecting the overall points beyond what's stated. So the comparison is straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is about two clubs, pontyclun rfc and barry rfc, regarding their average number of drawn games during 20 games played. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that both clubs have an average of 1 draw each over the 20 games they played. So, essentially, it's suggesting that each club drew 1 game on average.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different club with various statistics including the number of drawn games. I need to find the rows for pontyclun rfc and barry rfc.\n\nStarting with pontyclun rfc, which is in Row 2. The 'drawn' column shows that they have 0 draws. Next, checking barry rfc in Row 4, their 'drawn' count is 2. \n\nNow, calculating the average number of drawn games between these two clubs: (0 + 2) / 2 = 1. So, the average number of draws per club is indeed 1. However, the way the claim is phrased might be a bit tricky. It says they have an average of 1 draw during their 20 games. \n\nWait a second, each club played 20 games individually, right? So for pontyclun rfc, out of 20 games, they drew 0 times, and barry rfc drew 2 times out of their 20 games. The average across both clubs is 1 draw per club when considering both together, but individually, one has 0 and the other has 2.\n\nThe claim doesn't specify whether it's talking about each club having an average of 1 or the combined average. If we interpret it as each club averaging 1 draw in their respective 20 games, that would be incorrect because one has 0 and the other has 2. However, if it refers to the average between the two clubs, then it's correct.\n\nBut usually, when a claim mentions individual averages for multiple entities, it implies each entity meeting that average. Since pontyclun rfc has 0 draws, which is less than 1, the overall statement isn't accurate for both clubs individually. Therefore, the claim is false because one of them doesn't meet the average.\n\nSo, I should mark this as FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both pontyclun rfc and barry rfc have an average of 1 drawn game each over their 20 games. Checking the table:\n\n- **pontyclun rfc** (Row 2) has 0 draws.\n- **barry rfc** (Row 4) has 2 draws.\n\nCalculating the average for both clubs: (0 + 2) / 2 = 1 draw. However, since the claim implies each club individually averages 1 draw, which isn't true because one has 0 and the other has 2, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"for the total 20 game these team play , canton rfc achieve the lowest point.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions that all teams played a total of 20 games, which from the table, each row under 'played' is indeed 20 for every club. So that condition holds.\n\nNext, the main point is whether Canton RFC achieved the lowest points among all the teams. To verify this, I need to look at the 'points' column for each team.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- pontyclun rfc: 86 points\n- cilfynydd rfc: 74 points\n- barry rfc: 63 points\n- st albans rfc: 55 points\n- deri rfc: 52 points\n- hirwaun rfc: 51 points\n- penygraig rfc: 43 points\n- cowbridge rfc: 37 points\n- old penarthians rfc: 33 points\n- dinas powys rfc: 19 points\n- canton rfc: 10 points\n\nCanton RFC has the lowest points at 10. I need to make sure no other team has fewer than 10. Scanning through, all others have higher points than 10, so Canton is indeed the lowest.\n\nThe relevant cells for this claim are the 'points' column across all rows because I need to compare each team's points to confirm that Canton has the minimum.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"cilfynydd rfc have the most point through 20 game\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that Cilfynydd RFC have the most points over 20 games. So, I should check how many points each club has and see if Cilfynydd indeed has the highest.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple rows, each representing a different club with various statistics like played games, drawn, lost, points for, etc., including the total points. The key here is to find the \"points\" column for each club.\n\nThe table has 12 rows in total. Let me list out the points for each club:\n\n1. Pontyclun RFC: 86 points\n2. Cilfynydd RFC: 74 points\n3. Barry RFC: 63 points\n4. St Albans RFC: 55 points\n5. Deri RFC: 52 points\n6. Hirwaun RFC: 51 points\n7. Penygraig RFC: 43 points\n8. Cowbridge RFC: 37 points\n9. Old Penarthians RFC: 33 points\n10. Dinas Powys RFC: 19 points\n11. Canton RFC: 10 points\n\nNow, I'll compare these points to see which club has the most. Starting from the top:\n\n- Pontyclun has 86, which is the highest so far.\n- Cilfynydd has 74, which is less than Pontyclun.\n- The rest have even fewer points.\n\nSo, it's clear that Cilfynydd RFC doesn't have the most points; Pontyclun RFC does. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nTo verify this, I should note the relevant cells in the table. For each club, we're looking at the \"points\" column under their respective rows. Specifically, the row for Cilfynydd is Row 3 and for Pontyclun it's Row 2. Both have the \"points\" column as the key data point here.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n- For Cilfynydd RFC: row index 3 (since counting starts at 0, but looking back, in the original table provided by the user, rows start from 1? Wait, no\u2014the table was presented with Row 1 as headers and Rows 2 to 12 as data. So, in JSON terms, if we consider the first row after headers as index 2 (Row 2), then Cilfynydd is at row index 3 (since Row 3 corresponds to index 3). But when extracting data, usually rows are zero-indexed or one-indexed based on context. However, in this case, the user's example shows \"row_index\" as integers starting from 0 for headers, but perhaps here it's better to map them correctly.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the table provided:\n\n- Row 1 is the header: club, played, etc.\n- Rows 2-12 are data rows (from pontyclun rfc down to canton rfc).\n\nSo in terms of indices if we consider the first row as index 0 (header), then the data rows start from index 1. Therefore:\n\n- Row 2 is index 1: pontyclun\n- Row 3 is index 2: cilfynydd\nWait, no\u2014actually, no, perhaps in the user's table, each row is listed as Row 1, Row 2, etc., with Row 1 being the header and Rows 2-12 being data. So when extracting \"row_index\", it refers to these as per their listing. So Cilfynydd is Row 3 (third row in the table), which would be index 3 if starting from 0.\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, since the user's example shows row indices starting at 0 for the header, I think we need to adjust accordingly. Wait, no\u2014the example given by the user has:\n\n\"relevant_cells\": [ {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"}, ... ]\n\nWhich implies that the first data row is index 1 (since headers are often considered index 0). Therefore, in our case, the header is Row 1 as per the table listing, but perhaps the indices start at 1 for data rows. This can be confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider each data row starting from index 1. So Row 2 (pontyclun) is index 1, Row 3 (cilfynydd) is index 2, and so on up to Row 12 as index 11.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- Cilfynydd's points are in row index 2.\n- Pontyclun's points are in row index 1.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be these two rows under the \"points\" column.\n\nSo putting it all together, since Cilfynydd has fewer points than Pontyclun, the answer is FALSE, and the relevant cells include the points for both clubs.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"for the total 20 game these team play, penygraig rfc have the lowest losing bonus\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim step by step. The claim mentions that Penygraig RFC has the lowest losing bonus among all teams that played 20 games each.\n\nLooking at the table structure: Each row represents a club with various statistics. All clubs have \"played\": 20, so the condition about 20 games applies to all of them. Now, I need to check the \"losing bonus\" column for each team and find out which one is the lowest.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Pontyclun RFC: losing bonus is 2\n2. Cilfynydd RFC: losing bonus is 2\n3. Barry RFC: losing bonus is 2\n4. St Albans RFC: losing bonus is 4\n5. Deri RFC: losing bonus is 3\n6. Hirwaun RFC: losing bonus is 2\n7. Penygraig RFC: losing bonus is 1\n8. Cowbridge RFC: losing bonus is 4\n9. Old Penarthians RFC: losing bonus is 3\n10. Dinas Powys RFC: losing bonus is 3\n11. Canton RFC: losing bonus is 1\n\nWait, hold on. Penygraig RFC has a losing bonus of 1 according to row 8. But then looking at the last club, Canton RFC in row 12 also has a losing bonus of 1. So both have 1, which is lower than others.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Penygraig RFC has the lowest isn't entirely true because another team (Canton RFC) shares the same lowest value. However, if the claim is about having one of the lowest, but not necessarily the sole lowest, it's a bit ambiguous. But as stated, the claim says \"the lowest,\" implying that they are the only ones with that value.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The table shows:\n\n- Penygraig RFC: losing bonus 1 (row 8)\n- Canton RFC: losing bonus 1 (row 12)\n\nSo two teams have a losing bonus of 1. Thus, Penygraig isn't the only one with the lowest; it's tied with Canton. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because they don't have the sole lowest.\n\nWait, but sometimes \"lowest\" can mean among all, even if others share it. The question is whether they have the lowest, not necessarily being unique. So if multiple teams have the same lowest value, then each of them does indeed have the lowest. So maybe the claim is TRUE because Penygraig RFC has a losing bonus equal to the lowest in the table.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The claim says \"Penygraig RFC have the lowest losing bonus.\" If there are multiple teams with the same minimum value, then technically they all share the lowest. So it's still correct because Penygraig is among those with the lowest. But sometimes, \"the\" implies uniqueness. In English, when someone says \"X has the lowest Y,\" it can be ambiguous whether X is the sole holder or just one of multiple holders.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- Row 8: Penygraig RFC: losing bonus 1\n- Row 12: Canton RFC: losing bonus 1\n\nSo both have 1, which is the lowest. So the claim that Penygraig has the lowest is correct because they indeed are tied for the lowest.\n\nWait no, actually, I think \"the\" could imply the singular. But in data terms, when there's a tie for the minimum, each tied team does hold the lowest value. So perhaps the answer is TRUE because they do have the same losing bonus as others but it's still the minimum.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim was that they are the only ones with the lowest, then it would be FALSE. But since it just says \"have the lowest,\" which they do, even though not alone, maybe it's TRUE.\n\nBut wait, let me check all rows again to make sure I didn't miss any other team with a lower value.\n\nLooking through:\n\n1. 2\n2. 2\n3. 2\n4. 4\n5. 3\n6. 2\n7. 1 (Penygraig)\n8. 4\n9. 3\n10. 3\n11. 3\n12. 1 (Canton)\n\nSo the losing bonuses are: 2,2,2,4,3,2,1,4,3,3,3,1.\n\nSo the minimum is 1, achieved by Penygraig and Canton. Therefore, both have the lowest losing bonus.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Penygraig has the lowest is TRUE because they do indeed have a losing bonus of 1, which is the lowest in the table.\n\nWait no, but if multiple teams share the same minimum, then each can be said to have the lowest. So the answer should be TRUE because Penygraig does have a losing bonus equal to the lowest value present.\n\nBut earlier I thought that perhaps the claim would require them to be the only one, but in reality, having the same as others doesn't negate their status of being among those with the lowest. Therefore, the answer is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Penygraig RFC has the lowest losing bonus. By examining all teams, we find that both Penygraig and Canton have a losing bonus of 1, which is the minimum value in the table. Therefore, Penygraig does have one of the lowest losing bonuses.\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"losing bonus\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"losing bonus\"}\n   ]\n}",

The task is to determine whether the claim \"canton rfc lost all 20 games\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the table and what each column represents. The table lists various clubs with their performance statistics across several columns: club, played, drawn, lost, points for, points against, tries for, tries against, try bonus, losing bonus, and points.\n\nThe claim in question is about \"canton rfc\" and whether they lost all 20 games. So, I need to look into the row corresponding to canton rfc and check two key pieces of information: how many games they played and how many they lost.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different club. The last row (Row 12) is about canton rfc. According to this row:\n- Played: 20\n- Lost: 18\n\nThe claim states that they \"lost all 20 games.\" However, from the data, it's clear that they lost 18 games but didn't lose all 20. There are other possibilities for why they didn't lose all games; perhaps some were drawn or won. \n\nWait a minute\u2014looking back at the columns, there's a \"drawn\" column as well. The row shows \"drawn: 0,\" meaning they didn't have any draws. So if they played 20 games and had 0 draws, that leaves only wins and losses. They lost 18, so that means they won 2 games (since 20 total games = 18 lost + 2 others, which would be wins because there are no draws).\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"canton rfc lost all 20 games\" is incorrect. They actually lost 18 and won 2.\n\nTo support this conclusion, I should identify the relevant cells from the table:\n- The row for canton rfc (Row 12) has the \"played\" column with value 20.\n- Also in Row 12, the \"lost\" column shows 18.\n- Additionally, since there are no draws (drawn: 0), it confirms that they didn't lose all games.\n\nHence, based on this data, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"canton rfc lost all 20 games.\" According to the table, canton rfc played 20 games and lost 18. There are no drawn games, so they must have won the remaining 2. Therefore, they did not lose all 20 games.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n1. Locate the row for \"canton rfc\" in the table (Row 12).\n2. Check the \"played\" column: 20 games.\n3. Check the \"lost\" column: 18 losses.\n4. Since there are no draws (\"drawn\": 0), the remaining 2 games must be wins.\n5.

I'll go through each row starting from Row 2 (since Row 1 is headers) and note down the number of drawn games for each club.\n\nStarting with Row 2: Pontyclun RFC has 0 draws.\nRow 3: Cilfynydd RFC has 1 draw.\nRow 4: Barry RFC has 2 draws.\nRow 5: St Albans RFC has 0 draws.\nRow 6: Deri RFC has 0 draws.\nRow 7: Hirwaun RFC has 1 draw.\nRow 8: Penygraig RFC has 1 draw.\nRow 9: Cowbridge RFC has 1 draw.\nRow 10: Old Penarthians RFC has 0 draws.\nRow 11: Dinas Powys RFC has 0 draws.\nRow 12: Canton RFC has 0 draws.\n\nFrom this, I can see that Barry RFC is the only team with more than one draw\u2014they have exactly two. All other teams either have zero or just one drawn game. \n\nThe claim says Barry are \"the only\" team with more than one draw. Since no other club exceeds one draw, this makes the statement TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to list each cell that supports this conclusion. Each row's 'drawn' value is relevant because we're checking if any other team besides Barry has more than one draw. So, for every row from 2 to 12, the 'drawn' column was checked.\n\nSo compiling all these cells: rows 2 through 12, each with the 'drawn' column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "canton rfc gain the fourth - least point through 20 game",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"canton rfc gain the fourth - least point through 20 game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, \"canton rfc\" is one of the clubs listed in the table. I need to find their points and see where they stand. The phrase \"gain the fourth - least point\" suggests that among all the teams, they are ranked fourth from the bottom in terms of points. So, if there are 12 teams, being fourth from the bottom would mean they're in ninth place overall.\n\nLooking at the table, each club has a 'points' column. Let me list out the points for each team to see their rankings:\n\n- Pontyclun RFC: 86\n- Cilfynydd RFC: 74\n- Barry RFC: 63\n- St Albans RFC: 55\n- Deri RFC: 52\n- Hirwaun RFC: 51\n- Penygraig RFC: 43\n- Cowbridge RFC: 37\n- Old Penarthians RFC: 33\n- Dinas Powys RFC: 19\n- Canton RFC: 10\n\nWait, actually, when I list them in descending order:\n\n86 (Pontyclun), 74 (Cilfynydd), 63 (Barry), 55 (St Albans), 52 (Deri), 51 (Hirwaun), 43 (Penygraig), 37 (Cowbridge), 33 (Old Penarthians), 19 (Dinas Powys), 10 (Canton).\n\nWait, that's 11 teams. Hmm, but in the table there are 12 rows, including row 1 as headers. So clubs from row 2 to row 12 make 11 clubs.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRow 2: pontyclun rfc - points 86\nRow 3: cilfynydd rfc -74\nRow 4: barry rfc-63\nRow5: st albans-55\nRow6: deri-52\nRow7: hirwaun-51\nRow8: penygraig-43\nRow9: cowbridge-37\nRow10: old penarthians-33\nRow11: dinas powys-19\nRow12: canton-10\n\nSo total 11 teams. So from top to bottom in points:\n\n1. Pontyclun (86)\n2. Cilfynydd (74)\n3. Barry (63)\n4. St Albans (55)\n5. Deri (52)\n6. Hirwaun (51)\n7. Penygraig (43)\n8. Cowbridge (37)\n9. Old Penarthians (33)\n10. Dinas Powys (19)\n11. Canton (10)\n\nSo the ranking is from highest points to lowest.\n\nThe claim says that \"Canton RFC gain the fourth - least point through 20 game.\" So, \"fourth-least\" would mean they are the team with the fourth-lowest points. Since there are 11 teams, the fourth from the bottom would be at position 8 (because 11-4+1=8). Let me see:\n\nThe least points: Canton (10) is the lowest.\n\nThen Dinas Powys (19), Old Penarthians (33), Cowbridge (37), Penygraig (43), Hirwaun (51), Deri (52), St Albans (55), Barry (63), Cilfynydd (74), Pontyclun (86).\n\nWait, so in order from least to most points:\n\nCanton:10\nDinas Powys:19\nOld Penarthians:33\nCowbridge:37\nPenygraig:43\nHirwaun:51\nDeri:52\nSt Albans:55\nBarry:63\nCilfynydd:74\nPontyclun:86\n\nSo the fourth from the bottom (fourth-least) would be Cowbridge with 37 points. Because:\n\n1st least: Canton (10)\n2nd least: Dinas Powys (19)\n3rd least: Old Penarthians (33)\n4th least: Cowbridge (37)\n\nTherefore, the team with the fourth-least points is Cowbridge RFC.\n\nBut the claim says it's Canton RFC. So according to this, Canton is actually the team with the least points, not the fourth-least. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted \"fourth - least\". Maybe they mean the team in the fourth position when sorted from least to most. Let me see:\n\nIf we sort all teams by points from lowest (least) to highest:\n\n1. Canton: 10\n2. Dinas Powys:19\n3. Old Penarthians:33\n4. Cowbridge:37\n5. Penygraig:43\n6. Hirwaun:51\n7. Deri:52\n8. St Albans:55\n9. Barry:63\n10. Cilfynydd:74\n11. Pontyclun:86\n\nSo the fourth team in this list is Cowbridge with 37 points. Therefore, if the claim says Canton RFC has the fourth-least points, that's incorrect because Canton is actually first in the least points.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again:\n\nTotal teams:11\n\nIf we are to find the fourth-least, that would be the team that is number 4 when counting from the bottom (least points). So:\n\n1st least: Canton (10)\n2nd least: Dinas Powys (19)\n3rd least: Old Penarthians (33)\n4th least: Cowbridge (37)\n\nSo yes, Cowbridge is fourth-least. Therefore, the claim that \"canton rfc gain the fourth - least point\" is false because Canton actually has the least points, not the fourth.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting correctly. Sometimes \"fourth-least\" can be ambiguous. Let's consider: if we have 11 teams, the rankings from least to most would be:\n\n1st: Canton (10)\n2nd: Dinas Powys (19)\n3rd: Old Penarthians (33)\n4th: Cowbridge (37)\n\nSo yes, Cowbridge is fourth. Therefore, the claim that Canton RFC has the fourth-least points is incorrect; they have the least.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells would include all the 'points' columns for each team to see their rankings. So rows 2 to 12, column 'points'.\n\nSo in terms of row indices:\n\n- Row 2: Pontyclun RFC - points 86\n- Row3: Cilfynydd -74\n- Row4: Barry-63\n- Row5: St Albans-55\n- Row6: Deri-52\n- Row7: Hirwaun-51\n- Row8: Penygraig-43\n- Row9: Cowbridge-37\n- Row10: Old Penarthians-33\n- Row11: Dinas Powys-19\n- Row12: Canton-10\n\nAll of these are relevant because to determine the ranking, we need all teams' points.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE. Canton RFC has the least points (10), not the fourth-least.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
