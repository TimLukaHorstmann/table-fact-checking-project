    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"indiana state and cincinnati on september 11 draw the least attendance with only 30807 attend the game.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It mentions two teams, Indiana State and Cincinnati, playing on September 11, and their game had the lowest attendance of 30,807 people.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find which rows have these teams. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 1: September 10, West Virginia vs. Marshall. Not relevant.\n- Row 2: September 11, South Florida vs. No. 8 Florida. Attendance is 90,612.\n- Row 3: September 11, Indiana State (visiting) vs. Cincinnati (home). Attendance is 30,807.\n- Row 4: September 11, Texas Southern vs. Connecticut. Attendance is 37,359.\n- Row 5: September 11, New Hampshire vs. Pittsburgh. Attendance is 50,120.\n- Row 6: September 11, Eastern Kentucky vs. Louisville. Attendance is 51,427.\n- Row 7: September 11, Syracuse vs. Washington. Attendance is 62,418.\n\nSo, on September 11, there are six games listed. The attendance figures are as follows:\n\n- Row 3: 30,807 (Indiana State and Cincinnati)\n- Row 4: 37,359\n- Row 2: 90,612\n- Row 5: 50,120\n- Row 6: 51,427\n- Row 7: 62,418\n\nComparing these numbers, the lowest attendance is indeed 30,807 at Row 3. Therefore, the claim that Indiana State and Cincinnati's game on September 11 had the least attendance with only 30,807 attendees is correct.\n\nI should make sure there are no other games with lower attendance on the same date. All other attendances are higher than 30,807, so Row 3's figure is indeed the lowest.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the game between Indiana State and Cincinnati on September 11 had the smallest attendance of 30,807.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the home team win 5 of the 7 game play on the day list\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the table. There are seven rows, each representing a different game played on September 10 and September 11. Each row has details like date, time, visiting team, home team, site, broadcast, result, and attendance.\n\nThe claim is about home teams winning five out of seven games listed in the day's schedule. So, I need to check each row to see if the home team won that game.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Result is \"w 24 - 21 ot\". Since it's a home team (marshall), and result starts with 'w', which likely stands for win. So, Home Win.\n2. **Row 2**: Result is \"l 14 - 38\". The home team is Florida. Result 'l' means loss, so no home win here.\n3. **Row 3**: Result is \"w 40 -7\". Home team Cincinnati won.\n4. **Row 4**: Result is \"w 62-3\". Home team Connecticut won.\n5. **Row 5**: Result is \"w 38-16\". Home team Pittsburgh won.\n6. **Row 6**: Result is \"w 23-13\". Home team Louisville won.\n7. **Row 7**: Result is \"l 20 -41\". Home team Washington lost.\n\nNow, counting the home wins: Rows 1, 3, 4, 5, 6. That's five wins.

Let's break down the claim: \"the game in the middle of the day, with the exception of the florida game, have lower attendance than those play late afternoon or evening.\"\n\nFirst, I'll identify which games are considered \"middle of the day.\" Looking at the times, 12:00 pm is likely considered midday. There are multiple rows with time as 12:00 pm:\n\n- Row 2: September 11, 12:00 pm (Florida vs. South Florida)\n- Row 3: September 11, 12:00 pm (Cincinnati vs. Indiana State)\n- Row 4: September 11, 12:00 pm (Connecticut vs. Texas Southern)\n\nThen, there's a game at 1:00 pm in row 5 (Pittsburgh vs. New Hampshire) and one at 3:30 pm in row 6 (Louisville vs. Eastern Kentucky).

Let me break down each part of the claim and check against the relevant cells in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the game involving Washington as one of the teams. Scanning through the rows, I see that Row 7 mentions both \"visiting team: syracuse\" and \"home team: washington\". So, Washington is the home team here.\n\nNext, the claim states that Washington lost to Syracuse. In the result column of Row 7, it's written as \"l 20 - 41\". The 'l' indicates a loss by the home team (Washington), with scores showing Syracuse winning 41-20. So, yes, Washington did lose.\n\nThe claim also mentions that this happened in front of 62418 fans at home. Looking at the attendance column for Row 7, it's exactly 62418. Since Washington is the home team, their stadium would have hosted the game with that attendance number. Therefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the data.\n\nI'll collect the relevant cells to verify each part:\n- For the teams involved: \"visiting team\" and \"home team\" in Row 7.\n- For the result (loss): \"result\" column in Row 7.\n- For attendance: \"attendance\" column in Row 7.\n\nAll these details align with the claim, so I conclude it's TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"visiting team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"the largest attendance on september 11 be in the game between south florida and washington.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what this means. It's claiming that among all games played on September 11, the one involving South Florida and Washington had the highest attendance.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are multiple rows with dates on September 10 and September 11. Let me focus only on the games played on September 11 since the claim specifies that date.\n\nRow indices for September 11: Rows 2 to 7 (since Row 1 is September 10). Now, let's check each of these rows:\n\n- Row 2: South Florida vs. No. 8 Florida, attendance 90612\n- Row 3: Indiana State vs. Cincinnati, attendance 30807\n- Row 4: Texas Southern vs. Connecticut, attendance 37359\n- Row 5: New Hampshire vs. Pittsburgh, attendance 50120\n- Row 6: Eastern Kentucky vs. Louisville, attendance 51427\n- Row 7: Syracuse vs. Washington, attendance 62418\n\nWait, the claim mentions South Florida and Washington. Looking at the visiting and home teams:\n\nRow 2 is South Florida as the visiting team against Florida (home). Row 7 has Washington as the home team against Syracuse.\n\nSo the game involving South Florida is in Row 2, which had an attendance of 90612. The game involving Washington is in Row 7 with 62418 attendees.\n\nNow, comparing all attendances on September 11:\n\n- 90612 (Row 2)\n- 30807 (Row 3)\n- 37359 (Row 4)\n- 50120 (Row 5)\n- 51427 (Row 6)\n- 62418 (Row 7)\n\nThe highest attendance is indeed in Row 2 with 90612. The claim states that the largest was between South Florida and Washington, but according to the table, Washington isn't involved in that game; it's against Florida.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because while South Florida's game had the highest attendance on September 11, it wasn't against Washington. Instead, it was against No. 8 Florida.\n\nSo, I need to verify which cells are relevant:\n\nFor each row with date September 11, check 'attendance' and both team columns to see if they involve South Florida or Washington.\n\nRelevant cells would be:\n\n- For all rows on Sep 11, the 'date', 'visiting team', 'home team', and 'attendance'.\n\nBut specifically, for our determination, we looked at each row's attendance and teams. So the relevant cells are all the 'attendance' cells in rows with September 11 date.\n\nAlternatively, since the claim involves a specific game between South Florida and Washington, I should check if that game exists and its attendance compared to others.\n\nWait, looking back: The claim says \"the largest attendance on september 11 be in the game between south florida and washington.\" So first, is there a game between those two teams?\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 2: South Florida vs. Florida\nRow 7: Syracuse vs. Washington\n\nSo no game where South Florida plays against Washington. Therefore, that specific game isn't listed. Hence, the claim's assertion about that game having the largest attendance is false because such a game doesn't exist on that date.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume perhaps a typo and meant to refer to one of them separately, but as per the data, South Florida vs. Washington didn't occur on Sep 11. The highest was between South Florida and Florida with 90612, which is higher than all others on that day.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there's no game between South Florida and Washington on September 11. The largest attendance was in a different game.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** Only rows with date \"september 11\" are considered (Rows 2 to 7).\n\n2. **Check for the Game Mentioned:** Look for a game between South Florida and Washington. Such a game does not exist in the provided data.\n\n3. **Determine Largest Attendance on Sep 11:**\n   - Row 2: 90612\n   - Row 7: 62418\n   - Other rows have lower attendances.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since there's no game between South Florida and Washington, the claim is FALSE. Additionally, if considering a different interpretation, even the highest attendance (Row 2) isn't this specific game.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"visiting team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"visiting team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"indiana state and cincinnati on september 10 draw the least attendance with only 41382 attend the game.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what the claim is saying. It mentions two teams: Indiana State and Cincinnati playing on September 10, and that their game had the lowest attendance of 41,382 people.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table to see which rows have these teams or the specified date. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1 is about September 10. The home team is Marshall against visiting No. 23 West Virginia. Attendance was 41,382. So this game had that attendance number.\n\nNow, looking for Indiana State and Cincinnati: let's see Row 3. It says the date is September 11, with Indiana State as the visiting team and Cincinnati as the home team. The attendance there was 30,807.\n\nThe claim mentions September 10, but this game was on September 11. So that changes things. Also, the attendance for Row 3 is lower than Row 1's 41,382.\n\nWait, so if the claim says it's on September 10, but the actual game with Indiana State and Cincinnati was on September 11, then that part of the claim is incorrect.

I need to determine whether the claim \"the home team win all of the game play on the day list\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. It states that every home team listed in the table won their respective games. So, my task is to check each row and see if the result column indicates a 'W' (win) for the home team.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has multiple rows with columns like date, time, visiting team, home team, site, broadcast, result, and attendance. The key columns here are \"result\" since that's where the outcome of each game is recorded.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Result is \"w 24 - 21 ot\". The 'W' indicates a win for the home team (Marshall). This supports the claim.\n2. **Row 2**: Result is \"l 14 - 38\". Here, the home team is Florida, and they lost because it's an 'L'. This directly contradicts the claim.\n3. **Row 3**: Result is \"w 40 - 7\". The home team (Cincinnati) won, supporting the claim.\n4. **Row 4**: Result is \"w 62 - 3\". Home team (Connecticut) won, which supports the claim.\n5. **Row 5**: Result is \"w 38 - 16\". Home team (Pittsburgh) won, so this is good for the claim.\n6. **Row 6**: Result is \"w 23 - 13\". The home team (Louisville) won, which supports the claim.\n7. **Row 7**: Result is \"l 20 - 41\". Here, Washington is the home team and they lost, as indicated by 'L'. This also contradicts the claim.\n\nFrom this analysis, I found two instances where the home teams did not win (Rows 2 and 7). Therefore, the claim that all home teams won their games on September 10-11 is FALSE. \n\nThe relevant cells are in the \"result\" column across all rows because each one tells whether the home team won or lost.

I need to determine whether the claim \"washington win against syracuse in front of 62418 fan at home\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. **Team Involved**: Washington\n2. **Opponent**: Syracuse\n3. **Result**: Win\n4. **Attendance**: 62,418 fans\n5. **Location**: Home game\n\nNow, I'll look through each row of the table to find where Washington and Syracuse are involved.\n\nLooking at Row 7:\n- Date: September 11\n- Time: 7:00 pm\n- Visiting Team: Syracuse\n- Home Team: Washington\n- Site: Husky Stadium, Seattle, WA\n- Broadcast: FSN Northwest\n- Result: L 20 - 41 (which stands for Loss)\n- Attendance: 62,418\n\nFrom this row:\n- The home team is Washington.\n- They played against Syracuse as the visiting team.\n- The result was a loss (L) with scores 20-41. So Washington lost.\n- The attendance was exactly 62,418.\n\nThe claim states that Washington won against Syracuse at home in front of 62,418 fans. However, according to the table, Washington lost the game. Therefore, even though the attendance and location match, the result contradicts the claim.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE because Washington did not win; they lost.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Washington won against Syracuse at home with 62,418 attendees.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"all of the game in the middle of the day have lower attendance than those play late afternoon or evening\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what defines a game in the middle of the day versus those in the late afternoon or evening. The times given in the table are:\n\n- September 10: 7:00 pm\n- September 11: 12:00 pm (multiple games)\n- September 11: 1:00 pm\n- September 11: 3:30 pm\n\nI'll consider \"middle of the day\" as noon to around 3:00 pm, so times like 12:00 pm, 1:00 pm, and 3:30 pm. Late afternoon or evening would be from 3:30 pm onwards but in this case, since September 10 is 7:00 pm and September 11 has a game at 7:00 pm as well, those fall into the late afternoon/evening category.\n\nNext, I'll check each row to see if it falls into either category and then compare their attendances.\n\nLooking at Row 1 (September 10): time is 7:00 pm. Attendance is 41382. This would be a late game, so attendance here is higher than some midday games but I need to check others.\n\nRows 2-6 are on September 11:\n- Row 2: 12:00 pm (midday), attendance 90612\n- Row 3: 12:00 pm, attendance 30807\n- Row 4: 12:00 pm, attendance 37359\n- Row 5: 1:00 pm (midday), attendance 50120\n- Row 6: 3:30 pm (late afternoon), attendance 51427\n- Row 7: 7:00 pm, attendance 62418\n\nWait a minute. The claim says all midday games have lower attendance than late afternoon/evening games. So let's compare each midday game to the later ones.\n\nMidday attendances:\n- Row 2: 90612\n- Row 3: 30807\n- Row 4: 37359\n- Row 5: 50120\n\nLate afternoon/evening attendances (Rows 1, 6, 7):\nRow 1: 41382\nRow 6: 51427\nRow 7: 62418\n\nWait, but Row 2's attendance is 90612 which is higher than some of the late games. For example, Row 7 has 62418, and Row 1 has 41382. So a midday game (Row 2) has higher attendance than both late games in Rows 1 and 7.\n\nThat means not all midday games have lower attendance. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all midday games have lower attendance than evening or late afternoon games. However, Row 2 shows a midday game with an attendance of 90612, which is higher than some later games (e.g., Row 1:41382 and Row 7:62418). Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
