    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"aracely ar\u00e1mbula be the nominee for best lead actress\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row of the table to find information related to Aracely Ar\u00e1mbula and the category mentioned in the claim. The claim specifies \"best lead actress,\" so I'm searching for that exact category and the nominee name.\n\nLooking at Row 2: It mentions the year 2001, tvynovelas awards, best lead actress category. The nominee is Aracely Ar\u00e1mbula, and her result was 'nominated'. This matches exactly what the claim is stating. So this row directly supports the claim.\n\nI'll check other rows just to be thorough. Rows 1,3-10 don't mention Aracely Ar\u00e1mbula or the best lead actress category. They cover different categories and nominees.\n\nSo, based on Row 2, the claim is fully supported because it shows that Aracely Ar\u00e1mbula was indeed nominated in the best lead actress category at the 2001 tvynovelas awards.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"category\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"in 2001 there be a category of best support actress\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has several rows, each representing different categories and nominees from the 2001 TVyNovelas Awards. The columns include year, ceremony, category, nominee, and result.\n\nThe claim is about whether there was a \"best support actress\" category in 2001. So I need to check if any of the rows have that specific category listed.\n\nLooking through each row:\n- Row 1: Best telenovela\n- Row 2: Best lead actress\n- Row 3: Best lead actor\n- Row 4: Best female villain\n- Row 5: Best male villain\n- Row 6: Best supporting actress\n- Rows 7 to 10: Other categories like best supporting actor, best first actress, etc.\n\nWait a minute, row 6 has the category \"best supporting actress\" and the nominee is Carmen Salinas. The result says she was nominated, not that she won, but the presence of the category is confirmed here.\n\nSo the claim mentions \"support actress,\" which I believe refers to \"supporting actress.\" In the table, it's spelled as \"best supporting actress,\" so it's a match. Therefore, there was indeed such a category in 2001.\n\nThe relevant cell for this is row 6, specifically the \"category\" column.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"category\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"nailea norvind be the nominee who win for best male villain\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. Each row represents a nomination at the 2001 Tvynovelas Awards with details like category, nominee, and result. \n\nLooking at each relevant part of the claim:\n\n1. **Nominee**: The claim mentions \"nailea norvind\". I'll check each row to see if this name appears.\n   - Scanning through rows 1 to 10, I find that Nailea Norvind is listed as a nominee in Row 4.\n\n2. **Category**: The claim states she won for \"best male villain\". I need to verify the category and the result.\n   - Row 4 shows the category as \"best female villain\", not male. This already indicates a mismatch because Nailea is nominated in the female category, but the claim refers to a male one.\n\n3. **Result**: Even though the category is incorrect, let's check if she won her category.\n   - In Row 4, under 'result', it says \"won\". So she did win for best female villain.\n\nPutting it all together: The claim incorrectly attributes Nailea Norvind to winning in the male category when she actually won in the female category. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row 4's 'nominee' to confirm her name.\n- Row 4's 'category' to check the correct award category.\n- Row 4's 'result' to see that she won, but in the wrong category mentioned.\n\nThis confirms that Nailea Norvind did not win for best male villain; instead, she won for best female villain. Hence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The nominee listed here is Carmen Salinas with a result of \"nominated.\"\n\nNext, I check if there are any other nominees or winners in this category for 2001. Going through all the rows from 1 to 10, only Row 6 mentions the \"best supporting actress.\" There's no indication that another nominee was present or that there was a tie.\n\nSince the table shows only one nomination under this category without any mention of a tie or multiple winners, the claim is not supported by the data.
