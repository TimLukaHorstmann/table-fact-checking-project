    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the team geelong have the highest away team score in the list\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me look at what each row provides. The table has six rows, each representing a game played on 28 May 1932 between different teams. For each game, there are details like home team, their score, away team, their score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nThe claim is about Geelong's away team score being the highest among all away teams in this list. So I need to check all the away team scores across each row and see if Geelong indeed has the highest one.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Away team is St Kilda with a score of 8.10 (58).\n2. **Row 2**: Away team is Geelong with a score of 20.10 (130). Wait, that seems high because 20 goals and 10 behinds add up to 130 points.\n3. **Row 3**: Away team is Collingwood with 11.7 (73).\n4. **Row 4**: Away team is Melbourne with 12.16 (88).\n5. **Row 5**: Away team is Hawthorn with 6.9 (45).\n6. **Row 6**: Away team is Essendon with 9.11 (65).\n\nNow, compiling all the away scores:\n\n- St Kilda: 58\n- Geelong: 130\n- Collingwood: 73\n- Melbourne: 88\n- Hawthorn: 45\n- Essendon: 65\n\nLooking at these numbers, Geelong's score of 130 is significantly higher than all others. The next highest is Melbourne with 88, which is still lower than Geelong's 130.\n\nSo, the claim that Geelong has the highest away team score in this list is TRUE because their score of 20.10 (130) is indeed the highest among all away teams listed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as Geelong's away score is the highest at 130 points.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Each row has details like home team, their score, away team, their score, venue, crowd, and date. The claim is about North Melbourne's home team score being the highest.\n\nFirst, I need to find which row corresponds to North Melbourne as the home team. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Footscray vs St Kilda\n- Row 2: Fitzroy vs Geelong\n- Row 3: Carlton vs Collingwood\n- Row 4: North Melbourne vs Melbourne\n- Row 5: Richmond vs Hawthorn\n- Row 6: South Melbourne vs Essendon\n\nSo, the relevant row is Row 4. The home team score for North Melbourne is listed as 18.10 (118). Now, I need to compare this with all other home team scores in the table.\n\nLet's list out all home team scores:\n\n- Footscray: 13.14 (92)\n- Fitzroy: 12.6 (78)\n- Carlton: 13.15 (93)\n- North Melbourne: 18.10 (118)\n- Richmond: 13.18 (96)\n- South Melbourne: 14.15 (99)\n\nNow, I'll convert these scores into their total points to make comparison easier:\n\nFootscray: 13*6 +14 = 78+14=92  \nFitzroy: 12*6 +6=72+6=78  \nCarlton: 13*6 +15=78+15=93  \nNorth Melbourne: 18*6 +10=108+10=118  \nRichmond: 13*6 +18=78+18=96  \nSouth Melbourne: 14*6 +15=84+15=99  \n\nLooking at these totals:\n\n- Footscray: 92\n- Fitzroy: 78\n- Carlton: 93\n- North Melbourne: 118\n- Richmond: 96\n- South Melbourne: 99\n\nThe highest score among these is 118, which belongs to North Melbourne.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"arden street oval venue have 2000 crowd more than punt road oval.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's comparing the crowd numbers at two venues: Arden Street Oval and Punt Road Oval. Specifically, it's stating that Arden Street Oval has a crowd that's 2000 more than Punt Road Oval.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different game on May 28, 1932. Each row includes details like home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd, and date. \n\nI need to find the rows where the venues are Arden Street Oval and Punt Road Oval.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 4 has the venue as Arden Street Oval.\n- Row 5 has the venue as Punt Road Oval.\n\nNow, checking the crowd numbers for these two venues:\n\nFor Arden Street Oval (Row 4), the crowd is listed as 12000. \n\nFor Punt Road Oval (Row 5), the crowd is 10000.\n\nThe claim says that Arden Street Oval has 2000 more people than Punt Road Oval. Let's calculate the difference: 12000 - 10000 = 2000. So yes, the crowd at Arden Street Oval is exactly 2000 more than at Punt Road Oval.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. \n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells from the table that support this conclusion:\n\n- For Arden Street Oval (Row 4), we need the 'crowd' value.\n- For Punt Road Oval (Row 5), we also need the 'crowd' value.\n\nSo the relevant cells are Row 4's crowd and Row 5's crowd. \n\nI think that's all I need to check.

The claim says, \"the second largest crowd be on the venue of lake oval.\" So I need to check which venues had how many crowds and see where Lake Oval stands.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows, each with a home team, their score, away team, their score, venue, crowd, and date. All dates are 28 May 1932, so they're all from the same day. The relevant columns here are \"venue\" and \"crowd.\"\n\nFirst, I'll list out the venues and their corresponding crowds:\n\nRow 1: Western Oval - 14,000\nRow 2: Brunswick Street Oval - 13,000\nRow 3: Princes Park - 32,000\nRow 4: Arden Street Oval - 12,000\nRow 5: Punt Road Oval - 10,000\nRow 6: Lake Oval - 28,000\n\nNow, I need to determine the largest and second-largest crowds.

The second-largest is Lake Oval with 28,000. Therefore, the claim that \"the second largest crowd be on the venue of lake oval\" is true.\n\nThe relevant cells are the ones showing the venues and their crowds.

Let me start by understanding what each part of the table represents and how the data is structured.\n\nLooking at the table, it has six rows (rows 1 through 6), each representing a game with details like home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. All the games took place on May 28, 1932.\n\nThe claim is about South Melbourne having the highest home team score. So I need to check each row's home team score and compare them all to see if South Melbourne indeed has the highest one.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Home team is Footscray with a score of 13.14 (92). The scoring format seems to be goals.points, so their total points are 92.\n\nRow 2: Fitzroy is the home team with a score of 12.6 (78). Their total points are 78.\n\nRow 3: Carlton's home team score is 13.15 (93), totaling 93 points.\n\nRow 4: North Melbourne has 18.10 (118) points as the home team, which is pretty high at 118.\n\nRow 5: Richmond scored 13.18 (96) as the home team, so that's 96 points.\n\nRow 6: South Melbourne, the focus of the claim, has a score of 14.15 (99), totaling 99 points.\n\nNow, compiling all the home team scores:\n\n- Footscray: 92\n- Fitzroy: 78\n- Carlton: 93\n- North Melbourne: 118\n- Richmond: 96\n- South Melbourne: 99\n\nLooking at these numbers, I need to identify which is the highest. The scores are as follows: 92, 78, 93, 118, 96, 99.\n\nThe highest score here is North Melbourne with 118 points. South Melbourne comes next with 99 points, followed by Carlton at 93, Footscray at 92, Richmond at 96 (wait, that's higher than Carlton but lower than South Melbourne), and Fitzroy the lowest.\n\nWait a minute, I think I made an error there. Let me sort them again:\n\n- North Melbourne: 118\n- South Melbourne: 99\n- Richmond: 96\n- Carlton: 93\n- Footscray: 92\n- Fitzroy: 78\n\nSo North Melbourne is the highest, then South Melbourne, then Richmond, etc. Therefore, South Melbourne does not have the highest home team score; instead, it's second.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"south melbourne have the highest home team score in the list\" is false because North Melbourne has a higher score of 118 compared to South Melbourne's 99.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I examined each row's home team score:\n\n- Row 1 (Footscray): 92 points\n- Row 2 (Fitzroy): 78 points\n- Row 3 (Carlton): 93 points\n- Row 4 (North Melbourne): 118 points (highest)\n- Row 5 (Richmond): 96 points\n- Row 6 (South Melbourne): 99 points\n\nSince North Melbourne's score of 118 is higher than South Melbourne's 99, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is that \"lake oval be the venue which have the largest crowd in the list.\" My task is to determine if this claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking each row's information.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each row represents. Each row has details like home team, their score, away team, their score, venue, crowd size, and date. The date for all these rows is the same: 28 May 1932, so that part isn't relevant here. My focus should be on the 'venue' and 'crowd' columns.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"lake oval\" as the venue with the largest crowd.

Lake oval has a crowd of 28000, which is less than princes park.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"lake oval be the venue which have the largest crowd\" is incorrect because the actual largest crowd was at princes park with 32000 attendees.\n\nThe relevant cells are each row's 'venue' and 'crowd'. So for all six rows, I need to consider both columns. That way, I can compare all venues and their respective crowds to determine which one is the highest.\n\nSo compiling this, the answer should be FALSE because lake oval isn't the venue with the largest crowd; it's princes park.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"punt road oval venue have 2000 crowd more than arden street oval\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table to find the relevant data points mentioned in the claim. The claim compares the crowd numbers at two venues: Punt Road Oval and Arden Street Oval.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Western Oval\n- Row 2: Brunswick Street Oval\n- Row 3: Princes Park\n- Row 4: Arden Street Oval, with a crowd of 12,000\n- Row 5: Punt Road Oval, with a crowd of 10,000\n- Row 6: Lake Oval\n\nSo, for Punt Road Oval (Row 5), the crowd is 10,000. For Arden Street Oval (Row 4), the crowd is 12,000.\n\nThe claim says that Punt Road Oval has a crowd 2,000 more than Arden Street Oval. But according to the numbers, Punt Road Oval's crowd (10,000) is actually less than Arden Street Oval's crowd (12,000). In fact, it's 2,000 fewer.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the numbers don't support it. Instead of being higher by 2,000, Punt Road Oval has a lower attendance.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Punt Road Oval has a crowd 2,000 more than Arden Street Oval. Checking the data: Punt Road Oval had 10,000 attendees and Arden Street Oval had 12,000. Thus, Punt Road Oval's crowd is actually smaller by 2,000.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has given me a table with six rows of data about different Australian Rules Football matches on May 28, 1932. Each row includes details like home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd size, and date.\n\nThe claim to verify is: \"the third largest crowd be on the venue of lake oval\". I need to determine if this statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I'll identify which cells are relevant. The key elements in the claim are 'crowd' sizes and the 'venue' as Lake Oval. So, I'll look at each row's crowd number and venue name.\n\nLooking through each row:\n- Row 1: Venue Western Oval, Crowd 14000\n- Row 2: Venue Brunswick Street Oval, Crowd 13000\n- Row 3: Venue Princes Park, Crowd 32000\n- Row 4: Venue Arden Street Oval, Crowd 12000\n- Row 5: Venue Punt Road Oval, Crowd 10000\n- Row 6: Venue Lake Oval, Crowd 28000\n\nNext, I'll list the crowd numbers in descending order to find the third largest. The crowds are:\n32000 (Row 3), 28000 (Row 6), 14000 (Row 1), 13000 (Row 2), 12000 (Row 4), 10000 (Row 5).\n\nSo, the order is:\n1. 32000\n2. 28000\n3. 14000\n\nThe third largest crowd is 14000 at Western Oval, not Lake Oval. Therefore, the claim that the third largest crowd was at Lake Oval is incorrect.\n\nI'll structure my answer to reflect this analysis.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
