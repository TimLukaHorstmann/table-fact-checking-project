    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"tarso marques do not complete any lap\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and scan each row for the driver named Tarso Marques. I see that the table has 22 rows. Let's check each one:\n\nRow 1: Damon Hill\nRow 2: Jean Alesi\nRow 3: Michael Schumacher\nRow 4: Mika H\u00e4kkinen\nRow 5: Mika Salo\nRow 6: Olivier Panis\nRow 7: Eddie Irvine\nRow 8: Pedro Diniz\nRow 9: Ukyo Katayama\nRow 10: Pedro Lamy\nRow 11: Luca Badoer\nRow 12: Martin Brundle\nRow 13: Rubens Barrichello\nRow 14: Heinz-Harald Frentzen\nRow 15: David Coulthard\nRow 16: Johnny Herbert\nRow 17: Jacques Villeneuve\nRow 18: Gerhard Berger\nRow 19: Andrea Montermini\nRow 20: Ricardo Rosset\nRow 21: Jos Verstappen\nRow 22: Tarso Marques\n\nAlright, I found Tarso Marques in Row 22. Now, looking at the columns for this row:\n\n- Driver: Tarso Marques\n- Constructor: Minardi - Ford\n- Laps: 0\n- Time / Retired: Spun off\n- Grid: 21\n\nThe claim is about whether he completed any laps. The 'Laps' column shows 0, which means he didn't complete any laps. The time/retired column says \"Spun off,\" indicating that his race ended due to an accident without completing any laps.\n\nSo the relevant cell here is in Row 22 under the 'Laps' column. Since the value is 0, it directly supports the claim that he did not complete any lap.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"tarso marque start in grid 13 but do not complete any lap\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for Tarso Marques in the driver column. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 22: Driver is Tarso Marques. Let me check his details.\n  \nHis constructor is Minardi - Ford, laps are 0, time/retired is \"spun off\", and grid position is 21.\n\nThe claim says he started in grid 13. But according to row 22, his grid was 21, not 13. That's a discrepancy. \n\nAdditionally, the claim states he didn't complete any laps, which aligns with the table since laps are listed as 0.\n\nSo, even though he did start and didn't finish any laps, the grid position in the table doesn't match the claim. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions Tarso Marques starting at grid 13 but not completing any laps. Checking row 22: Tarso Marques started at grid 21 (not 13) and completed 0 laps.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
