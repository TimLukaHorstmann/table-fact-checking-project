    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the match held on January 26, 2006 had a result of 2-1.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the table to find the one with the date January 26, 2006. Scanning the dates:\n\nRow 1: June 7, 2000 \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 2: November 17, 2004 \u2013 nope.\nRow 3: Same as Row 2.\nRow 4: Again, same date as above.\nRow 5: June 8, 2005 \u2013 not the target date.\nRow 6: September 7, 2005 \u2013 still not matching.\nRow 7: October 26, 2005 \u2013 no match.\nRow 8: January 26, 2006 \u2013 this is the one.\n\nNow that I've found the relevant row (Row 8), I'll check the result. The claim says the result was 2-1. Looking at Row 8's \"result\" column, it indeed shows 2-1. \n\nSo both the date and the result match exactly with the claim. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 7,\n       \"column_name\": \"date\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 7,\n       \"column_name\": \"result\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",
