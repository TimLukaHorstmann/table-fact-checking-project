    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"north america account for half of the medal win at the 2012 game in football\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that North America accounts for half of the medals won. So, I need to check how many medals were won by countries in North America and see if they make up 50% of all the medals.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a nation along with their medal counts: gold, silver, bronze, and total. The rows are as follows:\n\n1. Mexico - rank 1, gold:1\n2. United States - rank 1, gold:1\n3. Brazil - rank 3, silver:1\n4. Japan - rank 3, silver:1\n5. Canada - rank 5, bronze:1\n6. South Korea - rank 5, bronze:1\n7. Total row with total medals across all categories.\n\nWait, but the table's last row says \"total\" for nation and shows gold:2, silver:2, bronze:2, total:6. So total medals are 6.\n\nNow, North America includes Mexico (row 1), United States (row 2), and Canada (row 5). Let me check each of their medals:\n\n- Mexico has 1 gold.\n- USA has 1 gold.\n- Canada has 1 bronze.\n\nSo adding up: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 medals from North America.\n\nTotal medals are 6, so half would be 3. So 3 out of 6 is indeed half. But wait, the claim mentions \"medal win at the 2012 game in football\". The table doesn't specify any sport; it's general, I think. Also, the total row shows 6 medals. Since North America accounts for 3, that's exactly half.\n\nBut let me double-check if all North American countries are included and no others. The nations listed are Mexico, USA, Brazil (which is in South America), Japan, Canada, South Korea. So only Mexico, USA, and Canada are from North America.\n\nSo their medals add up to 3. Total medals are 6, so yes, exactly half.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about the ranks. The table has two nations with rank 1: Mexico and USA. Then Brazil and Japan share rank 3, and Canada and South Korea share rank 5. But for counting medals, it's just the sum of their individual counts.\n\nYes, so 3 out of 6 is half. So the claim seems to be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that North America accounts for half of the medal wins. By examining the table, the relevant cells are those corresponding to Mexico, United States, and Canada, which together account for 3 medals out of a total of 6. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided. The table lists nations along with their medal counts and ranks. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the table carefully. There are seven rows in total. Rows 1 to 6 represent individual countries, and row 7 seems to be a summary of all medals. Each row has columns for rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, and total medals.\n\nThe claim is: \"4 out of 6 medal belong to country of north or south america.\" Hmm, I need to parse this correctly. It looks like the claim is stating that four out of six medals are from countries in North or South America. \n\nWait a second, let me clarify what's meant by \"belong to country of north or south america.\" Does it mean that each medal counts toward the total for their respective continents? Or does it mean that all medals from those two continents together amount to four out of six?\n\nLooking at row 7, which is the totals, there are 2 gold, 2 silver, and 2 bronze medals, making a total of 6 medals. So overall, there are 6 medals.\n\nNow, I need to find how many of these belong to countries in North or South America. Let's go through each country:\n\nRow 1: Mexico is in North America. They have 1 gold medal.\nRow 2: United States is also in North America. They have another gold medal.\nRow 3: Brazil is in South America, with a silver medal.\nRows 4,5,6: Japan and Canada (North America), South Korea\u2014wait, South Korea isn't in the Americas, so that's two bronze medals.\n\nWait, let me list each country:\n\n1. Mexico - North America\n2. United States - North America\n3. Brazil - South America\n4. Japan - Asia\n5. Canada - North America\n6. South Korea - Asia\n\nSo, from rows 1-6, the countries in the Americas are Mexico (row1), US (row2), Brazil (row3), and Canada (row5). Let's count their medals:\n\nMexico: 1 gold\nUS: 1 gold\nBrazil: 1 silver\nCanada: 1 bronze\n\nSo that's a total of 4 medals from the Americas. The other two medals are from Japan (silver) and South Korea (bronze), which are in Asia.\n\nTherefore, out of the total 6 medals, 4 belong to countries in North or South America. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to identify which parts of the table support this conclusion. We looked at each country's continent and their medal counts:\n\n- Mexico (row1): nation and gold\n- US (row2): nation and gold\n- Brazil (row3): nation and silver\n- Canada (row5): nation and bronze\n- Total medals: row7, total column.\n\nWait, but the user instruction says to list each cell that's relevant. So for each country in the Americas, we looked at their 'nation' and their respective medal counts.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\nRow1: nation (to confirm it's Mexico) and gold\nRow2: nation (US) and gold\nRow3: nation (Brazil) and silver\nRow5: nation (Canada) and bronze\nAnd perhaps row7 to get the total medals, but the claim doesn't directly mention the total; it just says 4 out of 6. So maybe only rows1-3 and 5 are needed for the count.\n\nWait, let me think again. The claim is about how many medals belong to countries in the Americas. Each medal from Mexico, US, Brazil, and Canada counts toward that. So each of their gold/silver/bronze cells contribute. Also, we need to know which countries they are, so 'nation' column is necessary.\n\nSo for each relevant row (1,2,3,5), we need both the nation and their respective medal count columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to note that rows 1-6 have medals from those countries. But since we're counting per country, I think each of their medals contribute to the total in the Americas.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\nFor Mexico: row0 (assuming 0-indexed), nation and gold\nWait, looking back at the table provided, it's rows1-6 as given. Wait no, in the naturalized format, row1 is rank1, nation Mexico etc., so perhaps rows start from 1.\n\nBut in programming terms, when we index, it's usually 0-based. But in the user's example, they used \"row_0\" for revenue, which was first row.\n\nWait no, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe table is given as Row 1 to Row7. So in naturalized format, each row starts with 'Row n: ...'.\n\nSo perhaps when identifying row indices, we consider them as 1-based? Or does it map to the JSON array as 0-based?\n\nWait, no\u2014probably, when the user refers to \"row_0\", they mean the first row in their data structure. So if the table is given with Row1: ... then perhaps in the code, these are stored in an array where index 0 corresponds to Row1.\n\nBut in any case, in the response example, the keys were row_index as integers starting from 0.\n\nWait, looking at the user's example:\n\nIn their sample JSON, they had \"row_0\" and \"row_1\", but that was under different contexts. In our case, we have rows 1-7. So perhaps in the response, the row indices are 0-based as per the array order.\n\nBut let me think again: The table given has rows from Row1 to Row7. If I'm listing the relevant cells, each object must specify \"row_index\" (int) and \"column_name\". \n\nSo for Mexico, it's in Row1 of the table, which would be index 0 if considering an array where the first element is Row1.\n\nWait no\u2014if the rows are given as Row1 to Row7, then perhaps in code, we might store them in a list starting at index 0. So Row1 is index0, Row2 index1, etc., up to Row7 being index6.\n\nSo when referring to Mexico (Row1), that's row_index=0. Similarly:\n\n- Mexico: row_index=0\n- US: row_index=1\n- Brazil: row_index=2\n- Japan: row_index=3\n- Canada: row_index=4\n- South Korea: row_index=5\n- Total: row_index=6\n\nSo for the relevant cells, we need:\n\nFor Mexico: 'nation' and 'gold'\nRow0, nation; Row0, gold.\n\nSimilarly, US: Row1, nation and gold.\n\nBrazil: Row2, nation and silver.\n\nCanada: Row4, nation and bronze.\n\nWait, but does the claim specify which medals? Or just that 4 of the 6 belong to those countries. So perhaps each medal from these countries counts as one towards the total.\n\nSo for Mexico's 1 gold, US's 1 gold, Brazil's 1 silver, Canada's 1 bronze\u2014each counts as a medal from the Americas.\n\nHence, we need to include all of their 'gold', 'silver', and 'bronze' columns? Or just that they have medals?\n\nWait no\u2014the claim is about how many medals are from countries in North or South America. So each medal from these four countries contributes to the count. But actually, in this case, Mexico (North America), US (North America), Brazil (South America), Canada (North America). So their total medals sum up.\n\nBut in reality, looking at the given data:\n\n- Row1: Mexico has 1 gold\n- Row2: US has 1 gold\n- Row3: Brazil has 1 silver\n- Row5: Canada has 1 bronze\n\nSo that's four medals. Hence, each of these cells (gold for Mexico and US, silver for Brazil, bronze for Canada) is relevant.\n\nAdditionally, we need to know the total number of medals, which is in row7 (index6), column 'total'.\n\nWait, but in this case, the total is 6. So perhaps that's also a relevant cell because it verifies that 4 out of 6 are from these countries.\n\nAlternatively, if all the other medals are accounted for (i.e., Japan and South Korea have 1 each), but since we're only interested in confirming four belong to Americas, maybe just their counts.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps including row7's total as well.\n\nSo compiling:\n\nRelevant cells:\n\n- Row0: nation and gold\n- Row1: nation and gold\n- Row2: nation and silver\n- Row4: nation and bronze\n- Row6: total\n\nWait, but in this case, the 'total' is 6. So to confirm that it's four out of six, we need row6's 'total' cell.\n\nBut perhaps for the purposes of this task, each relevant medal cell from the American countries is enough, as their sum is 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just the counts from those rows and the total.\n\nIn any case, the user wants us to list which cells are relevant. So I think including nation and respective medals for each country in question (Mexico, US, Brazil, Canada), plus the total cell.\n\nSo that's:\n\n- Row0: nation and gold\n- Row1: nation and gold\n- Row2: nation and silver\n- Row4: nation and bronze\n- Row6: total\n\nAlternatively, perhaps not including row6 if we don't need to confirm the total, but since the claim says 4 out of 6, it's better to include that.\n\nSo in JSON:\n\n[\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nation\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nation\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nation\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"silver\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nation\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bronze\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\" }\n]\n\nThat's a possible list.\n\nBut perhaps the user expects just the count of medals from each country without the nation column? No, because to confirm which countries belong to Americas, we need their names. So we must include 'nation' for those rows.\n\nSo in conclusion, I think the claim is TRUE and the relevant cells are as listed above.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE. The relevant cells that support this conclusion are:\n\n- Mexico's nation and gold count\n- US's nation and gold count\n- Brazil's nation and silver count\n- Canada's nation and bronze count\n- Total medals count\n\nHere is the JSON representation of these relevant cells:\n\n```json\n[\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nation\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nation\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nation\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"silver\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nation\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bronze\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\" }\n]\n```",

I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 6 total medal award at the 2012 olympic game in football\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, looking at the table structure. It has rows with rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, and total medals. There are seven rows in total. The last row (row index 6) mentions \"total\" for nation and shows 2 gold, 2 silver, 2 bronze, making a total of 6 medals.\n\nThe claim states there were 6 total medal awards in football during the 2012 Olympics. From the table's last row, it does show that the total number of medals across all categories is 6. However, I need to verify if this specifically pertains to football or not.\n\nWait a minute\u2014the table doesn't mention any sport; it just lists nations and their medal counts. There's no column or information indicating which sport these medals are from. So while the total medals in the table add up to 6, there's no way to link that number directly to football.\n\nTherefore, since the table doesn't specify the sport, I can't confirm if those 6 medals were indeed awarded for football. The claim might be making an assumption that isn't supported by the given data.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows a total of 6 medals but doesn't mention the sport.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"4 of the 6 medal go to north american country\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the table shows. It lists several nations with their medal counts and ranks. Each row has information about gold, silver, bronze medals, and the total. The last row is a total sum of all medals across all countries.\n\nThe claim mentions that 4 out of 6 medals went to North American countries. So I need to check two things: how many medals were awarded in total, and which of those went to North American nations.\n\nLooking at the table, the last row (row index 6) shows the totals: 2 gold, 2 silver, 2 bronze, making a total of 6 medals. That matches the claim's mention of 6 medals, so that part is correct.\n\nNext, I need to identify which countries are in North America. From the table:\n\n- Mexico (row 0) is definitely in North America.\n- The United States (row 1) is also a North American country.\n- Brazil (row 2) is in South America.\n- Japan (row 3) is in Asia.\n- Canada (row 4) is in North America.\n- South Korea (row 5) is in Asia.\n\nSo, the North American countries in the table are Mexico, United States, and Canada. Now I'll check how many medals each of these countries received.\n\nMexico has 1 gold medal, so that's 1.\nThe United States also has 1 gold medal, adding another 1.\nCanada has 1 bronze medal, which is 1 more.\n\nAdding those up: Mexico (1) + USA (1) + Canada (1) = 3 medals in total from North American countries. \n\nBut the claim says that 4 out of 6 went to North America. However, according to the table, only 3 medals were awarded to these three countries. The remaining medals (2 silver and 0 others) went to Brazil and Japan, which are not in North America.\n\nSo, since only 3 out of 6 medals went to North American countries, the claim that it's 4 is incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at what the table contains. Each row represents a nation and their medal counts (gold, silver, bronze) along with their total medals and rank. The last row seems to be a total across all countries.\n\nThe claim mentions that no single country won more than 1 medal in football. I need to check if any country has more than one medal. Looking at the table:\n\n- Mexico has 1 gold, others zero: total 1.\n- United States also has 1 gold, same as Mexico.\n- Brazil and Japan each have a silver medal (total 1).\n- Canada and South Korea each have a bronze medal (total 1).\n\nEach country in the table either has one medal or none. Even looking at the totals, there are 2 golds, 2 silvers, and 2 bronzes across all countries, but no single nation has more than one.\n\nWait, I should also check if \"football\" is explicitly mentioned here because the claim is about that specific sport. However, the table doesn't specify the sport; it's a general medal tally. The claim could be misleading by implying football specifically, but without data on which sport each medal was from, we can't confirm if all these medals are from football or other sports.\n\nBut given the information provided, since all countries have at most one medal, regardless of the sport, and assuming this table is about football medals, then yes, no country has more than one. If it's not, but we don't have data on that, maybe the claim isn't fully supported, but based on the table alone.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The user might just be referring to the medal counts in this table, regardless of sport. So each country has 1 or 0 medals, so no one has more than one. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nSo, checking each row: all countries have total medals equal to 1 or less? Wait, let's see:\n\nRow 1: Mexico - total 1\n\nRow 2: US - total 1\n\nRow3: Brazil - total 1\n\nRow4: Japan - total1 \n\nRows5 and6: Canada and South Korea each have 1.\n\nSo yes, all countries listed have at most 1 medal.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"north america account for half of the gold medal win in football at the 2012 summer olympics\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at what the table contains. It has rows with rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, and total medals. The nations listed are Mexico, United States, Brazil, Japan, Canada, South Korea, and a total row. Each of these rows except for the last one represents a country's medal count.\n\nThe claim is about North America accounting for half of the gold medals in football. So I need to see how many gold medals were won by North American countries and compare that to the total number of golds.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant columns are 'gold' and 'nation'. Let me check which countries are from North America. Mexico, United States, and Canada are all in North America. So I'll need to sum their gold medals.\n\nFrom row 1: Mexico has 1 gold.\nRow 2: United States also has 1 gold.\nRow 5: Canada's gold is 0.\nSo total from North America would be 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 golds.\n\nNow, the total number of gold medals according to the table is in row 7 under 'gold': 2. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if both Mexico and US have 1 each, that's already 2, but let me double-check. Oh wait, no, looking at the table again: Row 1 has 1 gold for Mexico, row 2 has 1 for US, rows 3 and 4 are Brazil and Japan with 0, row 5 Canada also 0. So total golds are indeed 1+1 = 2, but in row 7 it's 2 as well.\n\nThe claim says North America accounts for half of the gold medals. Half of 2 is 1. But wait, actually, North America contributed 2 out of 2 gold medals? That would be 100%, not half. So that can't be right because 2/2 is 1, which is 100%, not half.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recount. Mexico has 1, US has 1, Canada has 0. Total North American golds: 2. The total number of gold medals in the table is also 2. So 2 out of 2 is indeed 100%, so half would be 1. But that's not matching. Therefore, the claim that they account for half is incorrect because they actually account for all the golds.\n\nWait another thought: Perhaps I misread the table. Let me check again. The total row shows 'gold' as 2, which aligns with Mexico and US each having 1. So North America's contribution is indeed 2 out of 2. That means they have 100% of the gold medals, not half. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, identifying relevant cells: I need the 'gold' column for each country in North America (Mexico, US, Canada) and the total golds from the last row.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Row 1, 'gold'\n- Row 2, 'gold'\n- Row 5, 'gold'\n- Row 7, 'gold'\n\nThese are all needed to calculate both the North American total and the overall total.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because North America accounted for all of the gold medals (total 2), not half.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 8 total medal award for football at the 2012 olympic game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the table and then checking the claim against it.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a nation's performance in terms of medals won. The columns are rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, and total. There are six rows for individual nations and one last row labeled \"total\" which sums up all the medals: 2 golds, 2 silvers, and 2 bronzes, making a total of 6 medals.\n\nThe claim mentions 8 total medals awarded for football in the 2012 Olympics. However, the table doesn't specify anything about football; it's just a general medal count across different nations without any mention of sports. The \"total\" row adds up to 6 medals, which is less than 8.\n\nSo, since the table doesn't provide information about football specifically and only shows a total of 6 medals, the claim that there were 8 total medals awarded for football can't be supported by this data. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to football medals at the Olympics, but the table lacks any specific sports data. The total medals from all categories are 6, not 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Analyze the Claim:** It states there were 8 medals awarded for football in 2012.\n2. **Examine the Table Data:** Totals show 2 gold, 2 silver, and 2 bronze, summing to 6 medals without any mention of sports.\n3. **Conclusion:** No data supports 8 football medals; thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "south korea and the united state rank higher than all other competitor",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"south korea and the united state rank higher than all other competitor\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has several rows with columns like rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, and total. The claim mentions South Korea and the United States ranking higher than all other competitors.\n\nI need to check the ranks of each country. Let's go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Mexico is ranked 1.\nRow 2: United States is also ranked 1.\nRow 3: Brazil is ranked 3.\nRow 4: Japan is ranked 3.\nRow 5: Canada is ranked 5.\nRow 6: South Korea is ranked 5.\nRow 7: Total row, which I can ignore for this analysis.\n\nThe claim states that both South Korea and the United States rank higher than all other competitors. So, let's see if their ranks are indeed higher than others.\n\nLooking at the ranks:\n\n- Mexico: 1\n- United States: 1\n- Brazil: 3\n- Japan: 3\n- Canada: 5\n- South Korea: 5\n\nSouth Korea is ranked 5th, and there are other countries (Mexico and the US) that are ranked higher at 1st. Similarly, the United States is tied with Mexico at rank 1. However, the claim says they both rank higher than all others. \n\nWait, but in the table, there's a row for the United States with rank 1 and South Korea with rank 5. So, the US does rank higher than all others since it's first. But South Korea is ranked 5th, which isn't higher than everyone else; there are countries (like the US, Mexico) that are above them.\n\nSo, the claim says both South Korea and the US rank higher than all other competitors, but in reality, South Korea doesn't. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported because one part of it is false.\n\nTo confirm this, I'll check each nation's rank:\n\n- The United States: Rank 1 (highest)\n- Mexico: Rank 1 (tied with US)\n- Brazil and Japan: Rank 3\n- Canada and South Korea: Rank 5\n\nSo, the United States does rank higher than all others except Mexico, but since they are tied, it's still not higher. Wait, in the claim, \"higher\" might mean strictly above, so if they're tied at rank 1, then both can't be said to rank higher than all others because there's another country at the same rank.\n\nBut maybe the user considers being tied as ranking equally high. So perhaps the US is among the highest, but South Korea is not. Therefore, the claim that both rank higher than all other competitors isn't true since South Korea doesn't meet this condition.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE because while the United States ranks first (along with Mexico), South Korea does not; thus, the claim isn't fully supported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"only canada win more than 1 medal in football in the 2012 summer olympics\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the table structure. It has columns: rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total. Each row represents a country's medal count in some event, likely the Olympics since it mentions the 2012 Summer Olympics.\n\nLooking at each row:\n- Mexico and United States both have 1 gold medal each.\n- Brazil and Japan each have 1 silver.\n- Canada and South Korea each have 1 bronze.\n- The last row is a total, showing 2 golds, 2 silvers, 2 bronzes, totaling 6 medals.\n\nThe claim says only Canada won more than one medal. But looking at the table, Canada has only 1 bronze (row 5). Similarly, other countries have just one medal each too. The total across all is 6 medals, but that's not per nation. Each nation listed has exactly 1 medal except maybe others not shown?\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"football.\" Hmm, but in the table, there's no mention of sports; it just lists nations and their medal counts. So perhaps this table isn't about football specifically? Or maybe I'm supposed to assume that these are medals from football events.\n\nIf that's the case, then looking at each nation's medal count:\n- Mexico: 1 gold\n- US: 1 gold\n- Brazil: 1 silver\n- Japan: 1 silver\n- Canada: 1 bronze\n- South Korea: 1 bronze\n\nSo no country has more than one medal in this table. The total row shows overall totals across all nations, but individually, each nation only has one medal.\n\nThe claim says \"only Canada\" won more than one, which isn't true because Canada also only has one. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nTo support my answer, I'll note that all rows except the last show 1 medal per country. The relevant cells are each row's 'total' column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that only Canada won more than one medal in football during the 2012 Olympics. However, according to the table, every nation listed has a total of exactly 1 medal. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
