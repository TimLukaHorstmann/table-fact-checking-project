    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"the low point total for team with 81 place be 185.7\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim carefully. It mentions a team that has an 81st place and states that their point total is 185.7. So I need to check two things: does a team have 81 places? If yes, what are their points?\n\nLooking at the table row by row:\n\n- Row 9 shows \"places\": 81 for the team Stacey Smith / John Summers from the United States. Their points are listed as 185.7.\n\nSo the claim is correct because the team with 81 places has exactly 185.7 points.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells:\n\n- I need to identify which cells in the table support this claim. The key pieces of information are \"places\" being 81 and \"points\" being 185.7.\n- Row 9 contains both these details.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are row index 9 (since rows start at 0) for both \"places\" and \"points\".\n\nWait, actually, in the table provided, Row 9 is the 10th entry if counting from 1, but since JSON uses zero-based indexing, row_index should be 8. Wait no, looking back:\n\nWait, the user's table starts with Row 1: rank 1, and goes up to Row 20. So when they refer to \"row_1\", it's actually index 0 in programming terms, but perhaps in their system it's considering row numbers starting at 1. But in the example given earlier, the JSON uses row_index as an integer, which I think refers to the actual row number minus one (assuming zero-based). However, looking at the sample provided:\n\nIn the sample, for row_0: rank:1 and so on. So if Row 9 is index 8? Or perhaps it's considering rows starting from 1. Wait no, in the table above, each row is labeled as Row 1 to Row 20.\n\nBut looking at the claim: \"the low point total for team with 81 place be 185.7\". The team with places=81 is in Row 9 (assuming rows start at 1). So in JSON, if the row_index starts from 0, then it's index 8.\n\nBut wait, in the table provided, Row 9 has \"places\": 81 and points: 185.7. But the user didn't specify whether the row indices are zero-based or one-based. In the problem statement example, they used {\"row_index\":0} for the first row. So I think it's zero-based.\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\nIn the sample given in the instructions, the JSON has \"row_index\": 0, which corresponds to Row 1 in the table as presented. Therefore, each row's index is one less than its position in the table description.\n\nSo Row 9 in the table (as described with places:81) would be row_index 8.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are at row_index 8 for \"places\" and \"points\".\n\nWait, but looking back at the table:\n\n- The user's table is presented as Row 1 to Row 20. So in JSON terms, row indexes would be 0 to 19.\n\nSo for places=81, that's in Row 9 of the user's description, which corresponds to row_index 8.\n\nThus, relevant cells are:\n\n- {\"row_8\", \"places\"}\n- {\"row_8\", \"points\"}\n\nWait no, each cell is an object with row_index and column_name. So it should be two separate objects: one for places and one for points in that same row.\n\nSo the relevant_cells array would include both of these entries.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\",\"relevant_cells\":[{\"row_8\":\"places\"},{\"row_8\":\"points\"}]}\n\nWait, but JSON syntax requires string keys. So it should be:\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\":  [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"places\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nBut let me make sure about the row index.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- Row 1: rank 1\n...\nRow 9: places=81\n\nSo in JSON, row indexes start from 0. So Row 9 is index 8.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"places\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nBut wait, the problem says to return only the JSON object with those two keys. So I need to correct any syntax issues.\n\nFinal JSON:\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"places\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\" }\n   ]\n}\n\nBut let me check again: in the user's table, Row 9 is places=81 and points=185.7.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is TRUE with those two cells in row index 8 (since rows start at 0).\n\nFinal JSON:\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"places\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\" }\n   ]\n}\n\nBut wait, in the example given earlier, they used row index as integers starting at 0. So Row 9 is indeed 8.\n\nYes.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"places\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\" }\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"united kingdom finish with 187.84 point\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the subject of the claim is \"united kingdom.\" Looking at the table, I see that there are multiple entries where the nation is the United Kingdom. Specifically, in rows 5 and 8, the nation column lists \"united kingdom.\"\n\nThe claim states that they finished with \"187.84 points.\" To verify this, I'll check each row where the nation is the UK to see if any of them have exactly 187.84 points.\n\nRow 5: The points are listed as 194.0. That's higher than 187.84, so it doesn't match.\nRow 8: The points here are 187.84. This matches the claim exactly.\n\nSo, there is an entry where the United Kingdom has 187.84 points. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, to compile the relevant cells for this verification. I need to point out the rows and columns that were checked:\n\n- For row 5: Checked the 'points' column.\n- For row 8: Checked the 'points' column as well because it's where the matching points are found.\n\nSo the relevant cells are in row indexes 4 (since counting starts at 0, so row 5 is index 4) and 7 (row 8), both under the 'points' column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the United Kingdom's pair Jayne Torvill/Christopher Dean scored exactly 187.84 points as shown in row 8 of the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"yumiko kage / tadayuki takahashi come in 98th place\" is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the table to find the row that corresponds to Yumiko Kage and Tadayuki Takahashi. Scanning through the rows, I see that Row 19 has their names: \"yumiko kage / tadayuki takahashi\" from Japan with points 153.3 and places 175.\n\nThe claim says they came in 98th place, but according to the table, their place is listed as 175. That's a significant difference. Therefore, the claim doesn't match what's in the table.\n\nSo, the relevant cells here are the 'places' column for that specific row. Since the places value isn't 98 but 175, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"places\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with several rows and columns, each containing information about different pairs of people along with their rank, nation, points, and places. The claim is: \"claudio koch  / peter sch\u00fcbl come in 81st place.\" I need to determine if this claim is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I should look through each row to find if there's a pair named Claudio Koch and Peter Sch\u00fcbl. Let me go through the rows one by one:\n\n- Row 1: Natalia Linichuk / Gennadi Karponosov from the Soviet Union with points 207.86, place 9.\n- Row 2: Krisztina Reg\u0151czy / Andr\u00e1s Sallay from Hungary with points 204.1, place 22.\n- ...\n- Continuing down, I see various names but none matching Claudio Koch and Peter Sch\u00fcbl until I reach the last row.\n\nLooking at Row 20: The name is Claudia Koch / Peter Sch\u00fcbl, nation Austria, points 151.94, places 174. Hmm, that's close to what the claim says, but there are a couple of differences. First, the first name in the table is \"Claudia\" while the claim says \"Claudio.\" Also, the place mentioned in the table for this pair is 174th, not 81st.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any other row has Claudio Koch / Peter Sch\u00fcbl. Let me scan through again quickly. No, it seems that Row 20 is the only one with a similar name, but with Claudia instead of Claudio and place 174 instead of 81.\n\nSo, the claim says \"claudio koch / peter sch\u00fcbl come in 81st place.\" But according to the table, Claudia Koch / Peter Sch\u00fcbl are ranked 20th overall and placed 174th. Therefore, the claim is incorrect on both counts: the name (Claudio vs. Claudia) and the placement (81 vs. 174). \n\nAdditionally, I should check if there's any other row where the place is 81. Looking through each row's 'places' column:\n\n- Row 9 has a place of 81 with the pair Stacey Smith / John Summers from the United States.\n\nSo, Stacey and John are in 81st place, not Claudio Koch and Peter Sch\u00fcbl. Therefore, the claim is false because both the name and the placement do not match any entry in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that \"Claudio Koch / Peter Sch\u00fcbl\" came in 81st place. The correct name from the table is \"Claudia Koch / Peter Sch\u00fcbl,\" who are ranked 20th with a place of 174, not 81. Additionally, the pair in 81st place is Stacey Smith / John Summers.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 20-1, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9-1, \"column_name\": \"places\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
