    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"On August 13th, 1966, the away team was North Melbourne, while the home team was Collingwood.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has six rows, each representing a game with details like home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific teams: Collingwood as the home team and North Melbourne as the away team on August 13th, 1966. So I need to check each row to see if any of them match these details on that exact date.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Home is St Kilda vs Away South Melbourne \u2013 not Collingwood or North Melbourne.\nRow 2: Home Essendon vs Away Fitzroy \u2013 again, neither team matches the claim.\nRow 3: Here's home Collingwood vs away North Melbourne. The date here is August 13, 1966. That seems to match exactly what the claim states.\nRows 4-6 don't involve either of these teams on that date.\n\nSo, Row 3 is where both conditions are met. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because it accurately reflects the data in row 3. The relevant cells would be the home team (Collingwood) and away team (North Melbourne), along with the date to confirm it's August 13th.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly identifies that on August 13, 1966, Collingwood was the home team and North Melbourne was the away team. The relevant cells are found in row 3.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
