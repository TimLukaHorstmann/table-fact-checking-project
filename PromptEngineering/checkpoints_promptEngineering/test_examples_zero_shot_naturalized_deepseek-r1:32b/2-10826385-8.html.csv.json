The task is to determine if the claim \"melbourne be the home team with the highest score at 20.14\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means:\n\n- **Home Team**: Melbourne is mentioned as the home team.\n- **Highest Score**: The score given is 20.14 (which converts to a total of 134 points).\n\nNow, looking at the table, there are six rows, each representing a different game on May 20, 1972. My goal is to check two things:\n\n1. **Is Melbourne listed as the home team in any row?**\n   - Scanning through the rows:\n     - Row 1: Collingwood (home)\n     - Row 2: Melbourne (home)\n     - Row 3: South Melbourne (home)\n     - Row 4: North Melbourne (home)\n     - Row 5: St Kilda (home)\n     - Row 6: Richmond (home)\n   - Yes, Melbourne is the home team in Row 2.\n\n2. **Is this score the highest among all home teams?**\n   - I'll list out the home team scores:\n     - Collingwood: 7.14 (56 points)\n     - Melbourne: 20.14 (134 points)\n     - South Melbourne: 9.7 (61 points)\n     - North Melbourne: 8.13 (61 points)\n     - St Kilda: 10.12 (72 points)\n     - Richmond: 11.25 (91 points)\n   - Comparing these, Melbourne's 134 is indeed the highest.\n\nSo both conditions of the claim are satisfied. Melbourne is a home team and has the highest score among all home teams in that table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Melbourne is listed as the home team with the highest score of 20.14 (134 points), which exceeds all other home team scores.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"fitzroy be the away team with the highest score at 18.11\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the table. Each row represents a game played on May 20, 1972. The columns include home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Since all games were on the same date, I don't need to worry about different dates affecting the comparison.\n\nThe claim is about Fitzroy being the away team with the highest score of 18.11. So, my task is two-fold: confirm that Fitzroy was indeed an away team in one of these rows and check if their score of 18.11 is the highest among all away teams.\n\nLet me go through each row to identify which ones have Fitzroy as the away team. \n\nLooking at Row 3:\n- Home team: South Melbourne\n- Away team: Fitzroy\n- Away team score: 18.11 (which is 119 points)\n\nSo, in this row, Fitzroy scored 18 goals and 11 behinds, totaling 119 points.\n\nNow, I need to compare this score with the away team scores from all other rows to see if it's the highest.\n\nLet me list out all the away teams and their respective scores:\n\n- Row 1: Away team Footscray, score 11.14 (80)\n- Row 2: Away team Geelong, score 14.17 (101)\n- Row 3: Away team Fitzroy, score 18.11 (119)\n- Row 4: Away team Essendon, score 14.12 (96)\n- Row 5: Away team Carlton, score 14.15 (99)\n- Row 6: Away team Hawthorn, score 13.6 (84)\n\nLooking at these scores:\n- Footscray: 80\n- Geelong: 101\n- Fitzroy: 119\n- Essendon: 96\n- Carlton: 99\n- Hawthorn: 84\n\nThe highest score here is indeed 119 by Fitzroy, which is higher than the next highest of 101 (Geelong) and 99 (Carlton). So, no other away team in these rows has a higher score than Fitzroy.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Fitzroy was the away team with the highest score at 18.11 (119 points) is TRUE.\n\nI need to identify which cells are relevant for this conclusion. The key cells are those that specify that Fitzroy was the away team in Row 3 and their corresponding score. \n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 3, \"away team\" column\n- Row 3, \"away team score\" column\n\nThese cells directly support both parts of the claim: identifying Fitzroy as the away team and confirming their high score.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"the game at moorabbin oval have the largest crowd, with 31547 crowd.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find where the venue is moorabbin oval. From the rows given:\n\n- Row 1: Venue is Victoria Park\n- Row 2: Venue is MCG\n- Row 3: Venue is Lake Oval\n- Row 4: Venue is Arden Street Oval\n- Row 5: Venue is Moorabbin Oval\n- Row 6: Venue is VFL Park\n\nSo, the game at Moorabbin Oval is in Row 5. The crowd number there is 31547.\n\nNext, I need to check if this is indeed the largest crowd among all games on that date. Let me list out all the crowd numbers:\n\n- Row 1: 25986\n- Row 2: 19023\n- Row 3: 12421\n- Row 4: 14091\n- Row 5: 31547\n- Row 6: 25845\n\nLooking at these numbers, 31547 is the highest. The next closest are 25986 and 25845 in Rows 1 and 6.

The claim states: \"the game at mcg , lake oval , and arden street oval all have crowd with less than 20000 crowd.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is referring to. It mentions three venues: mcg, lake oval, and arden street oval. For each of these, I need to check the crowd numbers from the table.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- Row 1: Home team Collingwood vs Footscray at Victoria Park with a crowd of 25986.\n- Row 2: Melbourne vs Geelong at mcg with 19023 people.\n- Row 3: South Melbourne vs Fitzroy at lake oval, crowd is 12421.\n- Row 4: North Melbourne vs Essendon at arden street oval, crowd is 14091.\n- Rows 5 and 6 are other games not involving the venues mentioned in the claim.\n\nSo the relevant rows for the claim are rows 2, 3, and 4 because those are the games played at mcg, lake oval, and arden street oval respectively. \n\nNow, I'll check each of these crowd numbers:\n\n- Row 2: mcg has a crowd of 19023. Is this less than 20000? Yes, it's under.\n- Row 3: Lake Oval has 12421. Also under 20000.\n- Row 4: Arden Street Oval has 14091. Again, below 20000.\n\nSince all three venues listed in the claim have crowd numbers less than 20000, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI'll make sure to note which cells were relevant for this determination.

To verify this, I need to check the 'date' column for each of the six rows.\n\nLooking at Row 1: The date is listed as \"20 may 1972\". Similarly, Rows 2 through 6 all have the same date. Each row's date matches May 20, 1972, which means every game in the table was indeed played on that specific date.\n\nTherefore, since all six games were set on May 20, 1972, as indicated by their respective dates in each row of the table, the claim is supported and should be considered TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking each row's date.

My task is to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information given in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. Each row represents a game with details like home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. The claim states: \"melbourne be the home team with the highest score at 18.11.\"\n\nBreaking down the claim:\n1. Identify if Melbourne is a home team.\n2. Check what their score was.\n3. Verify if this score is the highest among all home teams.\n4. Ensure the score mentioned in the claim (18.11) matches the actual score.\n\nLooking at Row 2: Home team is Melbourne, and their score is listed as 20.14 (which equals 134). The away team is Geelong with a score of 14.17 (101).\n\nNow, checking all home team scores:\n- Collingwood: 7.14 (56)\n- Melbourne: 20.14 (134) - this seems higher than others\n- South Melbourne: 9.7 (61)\n- North Melbourne: 8.13 (61)\n- St Kilda: 10.12 (72)\n- Richmond: 11.25 (91)\n\nMelbourne's score of 134 is indeed the highest among home teams. However, the claim mentions a score of 18.11 for Melbourne as the home team with the highest score. Wait, that doesn't match. The actual score in Row 2 for Melbourne is 20.14, not 18.11.\n\nLooking back, I see that Fitzroy (away team in Row 3) has a score of 18.11 (119). So the claim incorrectly attributes Fitzroy's score to Melbourne as the home team.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because while Melbourne was the home team with the highest score, their actual score was higher than what's stated in the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Melbourne was the home team with the highest score at 18.11.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says Fitzroy was the home team and had the highest score of 18.11 (which I assume translates to 119 points). \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match on May 20, 1972. Each row has details like home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nI'll go through each row to check where Fitzroy is mentioned as the home team or away team and their respective scores.\n\nRow 1: Collingwood vs Footscray. Neither is Fitzroy.\nRow 2: Melbourne vs Geelong. No Fitzroy here.\nRow 3: South Melbourne vs Fitzroy. Here, Fitzroy is the away team with a score of 18.11 (119). The home team in this row is South Melbourne with 9.7 (61).\nRow 4: North Melbourne vs Essendon. No Fitzroy.\nRow 5: St Kilda vs Carlton. Again, no Fitzroy.\nRow 6: Richmond vs Hawthorn. Still no Fitzroy.\n\nSo, the only row where Fitzroy appears is Row 3 as the away team. Their score was indeed 18.11 (119). But since they were the away team, not the home team, that part of the claim is incorrect. \n\nNow, checking if any home team had a higher score than 18.11. Let's look at all home team scores:\n\nRow 1: Collingwood - 7.14 (56)\nRow 2: Melbourne - 20.14 (134)\nRow 3: South Melbourne - 9.7 (61)\nRow 4: North Melbourne - 8.13 (61)\nRow 5: St Kilda - 10.12 (72)\nRow 6: Richmond - 11.25 (91)\n\nThe highest home team score is in Row 2, where Melbourne scored 20.14 (134). This is higher than Fitzroy's away score of 18.11 (119).\n\nTherefore, the claim that Fitzroy was the home team with the highest score isn't accurate on two counts: they weren't the home team in their game, and another home team had a higher score.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states Fitzroy as the home team with the highest score.

The claim mentions two key points:\n1. The game was held at Lake Oval.\n2. This game had a crowd of 31,547, which is the largest among all games listed.\n\nNext, I need to refer back to the table provided. Let me go through each row one by one to extract the necessary information.\n\nLooking at Row 1: The venue is Victoria Park with a crowd of 25,986.\nRow 2: Venue is MCG, crowd 19,023.\nRow 3: Venue is Lake Oval, and the crowd here is 12,421. Wait, that's significantly lower than 31,547. So this row directly relates to Lake Oval but doesn't support the claim about having a large crowd.\nRow 4: Arden Street Oval with 14,091 attendees.\nRow 5: Moorabbin Oval had 31,547 people in attendance. That's a high number compared to others.\nRow 6: VFL Park, crowd of 25,845.\n\nNow, the claim states that the game at Lake Oval had the largest crowd with 31,547. However, from Row 5, Moorabbin Oval is where the crowd was 31,547, not Lake Oval. Therefore, the claim incorrectly associates this large crowd figure with Lake Oval when it's actually for Moorabbin Oval.\n\nAdditionally, checking the other venues' crowds confirms that 31,547 is indeed the highest in the table (Row 5: st kilda vs carlton at moorabbin oval). Therefore, the claim is false because it misattributes this large crowd to Lake Oval instead of Moorabbin Oval.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 3 for Lake Oval's crowd count.\n- Row 5 for the venue and crowd that actually had the highest attendance.\n\nThis confirms that the claim is FALSE as it incorrectly states the venue with the largest crowd.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}",

Looking at Row 6, which is the game at VFL Park. The crowd there was 25845. That's more than 20,000, so that alone makes the claim FALSE because not all three venues have crowds under 20,000.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I'll check Lake Oval as well. Lake Oval is in Row 3.

Checking each venue:\n\n- **VFL Park (Row 6)**: Crowd is 25845 (>20,000)\n- **Lake Oval (Row 3)**: Crowd is 12421 (<20,000)\n- **Arden Street Oval (Row 4)**: Crowd is 14091 (<20,000)\n\nSince VFL Park's crowd exceeds 20,000, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the 6 game list be all set on may 25 , 1972\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It states that all six games were held on May 25, 1972. So I need to check each row in the table to see what date each game was played.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are six rows, each representing a game with details like home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd, and date. The relevant column here is \"date\".\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n- Row 1: Date is May 20, 1972.\n- Row 2: Date is May 20, 1972.\n- Row 3: Date is May 20, 1972.\n- Row 4: Date is May 20, 1972.\n- Row 5: Date is May 20, 1972.\n- Row 6: Date is May 20, 1972.\n\nWait a minute. All six games are listed as happening on May 20, not May 25. The claim says all were on the 25th. That's a discrepancy. \n\nSo, each row's date column shows May 20, which doesn't match the claim's May 25. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nNow, I need to note the relevant cells that support this conclusion. Each of the six rows has a \"date\" column indicating May 20, so all these cells are relevant because they directly contradict the claim's date.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies May 25, but every game in the table is on May 20.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
