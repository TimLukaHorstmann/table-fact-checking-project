    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the match with opponent cleber luciano last 7:57\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any row where the opponent is \"cleber luciano.\" Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 13 mentions Cleber Luciano as the opponent. Let me check all columns in this row to see if they match the claim.\n\nLooking at the details of Row 13:\n- Result: win\n- Record: 3 - 0\n- Opponent: cleber luciano (matches)\n- Method: ko\n- Event: ec 22 - extreme challenge 22\n- Round: 1\n- Time: 7:57\n\nThe claim mentions \"last 7:57,\" which I interpret as the duration of the match. In Row 13, under the 'time' column, it's exactly 7:57. This matches perfectly.\n\nSo, all parts of the claim are supported by this row:\n- Opponent is Cleber Luciano.\n- The time taken was 7 minutes and 57 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because both pieces of information from the claim are found in Row 13.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there's a match against Cleber Luciano with a duration of 7:57. Looking at Row 13, it confirms this with the opponent being Cleber Luciano and the time as 7:57.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"tko (cut) be the method in round 1 of the ufc 20 event\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through each part of the claim step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components:\n1. The method used was tko via a cut.\n2. This occurred in round 1.\n3. The event name is UFC 20.\n\nI'll start by looking for all rows where the event is \"ufc 20\". Scanning through each row, I find that Row 11 mentions \"ufc 20\" as the event. \n\nNow, checking Row 11's details:\n- Method: tko (cut)\n- Round: 1\n\nThe claim states that the method was tko with a cut in round 1 of UFC 20. According to the table, Row 11 matches all these criteria. The result for this row is \"loss\", but since the claim doesn't specify the outcome, only the method and event details, that's irrelevant here.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in Row 11.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Row 11 shows a tko (cut) method in round 1 of UFC 20.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Event:** Look for rows where the event is \"ufc 20\". This is found in Row 11.\n2. **Check Method and Round:** In Row 11, the method is \"tko (cut)\" and the round is 1, matching the claim.\n3. **Conclusion:** Since all aspects of the claim are satisfied by Row 11, the answer is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the ufc 20 event end with a method of decision (unanimus)\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim refers to an event named \"ufc 20\". Looking at the table, I'll scan through the 'event' column in each row to find where it mentions UFC 20. \n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: lip 1\n- Row 2: hfp 2\n- Row 3: ufc 33\n- Row 4: ufc 32\n- Row 5: ufc 30\n- Row 6: ufc 29\n- Row 7: ufc 27\n- Row 8: kotc 4\n- Row 9: ufc 24\n- Row 10: pride 8\n- Row 11: ufc 20\n- Rows 12,13,14 don't have ufc in the event.\n\nSo, I found that Row 11 has \"ufc 20\" as the event. Now, I need to check what the method was for this event. \n\nIn Row 11, the 'method' is listed as \"tko (cut)\", not a decision. The claim says it ended with a \"decision (unanimus)\", which would be a unanimous decision. But according to the table, the method is tko, specifically due to a cut.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check if any other rows have UFC 20 or similar events that might be confused with UFC 20. Scanning again, no other rows mention UFC 20 except Row 11. \n\nTherefore, since the method in Row 11 is tko and not a decision, the claim is incorrect. The relevant cell here is the 'method' column in Row 11.\n\nSo, putting it together: the claim says UFC 20 ended with a decision (unanimous), but according to the table, it ended with a tko. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the UFC 20 event ended with a method of \"decision (unanimus)\". Checking the table, the relevant row for UFC 20 is Row 11, which shows the method as \"tko (cut)\", not a decision. Hence, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
