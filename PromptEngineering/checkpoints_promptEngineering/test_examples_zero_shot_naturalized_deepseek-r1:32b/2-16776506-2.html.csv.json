    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with several rows and columns, each containing information about different matches or tournaments. The claim I need to check is: \"on 2 may 1999, the surface be hard.\" Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim. It specifies a date, which is 2 May 1999, and it mentions that the surface was hard on that day. My task is to verify if this statement is true or false based on the data provided in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an outcome of a match\u2014either a win or a runner-up result\u2014with details like date, location, surface type, opponent, and score. So, I need to find the row where the date matches 2 May 1999.\n\nStarting from Row 1: The date is listed as \"2 may 1999.\" That's exactly what the claim is referring to. Now, in this same row, under the \"surface\" column, it says \"hard.\" So that directly supports the claim that on that date, the surface was hard.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure there are no other rows with the same date. Scanning through Rows 2 to 10, none of them have the date 2 May 1999. So Row 1 is the only relevant row here.\n\nThe claim doesn't mention anything about the opponent or the score; it's solely focused on the surface type and the specific date. Therefore, as long as the surface in that particular row is hard, the claim holds true.\n\nIs there any possibility that another row could affect this? Well, no, because each row corresponds to a unique event with its own date. Since only Row 1 has the date mentioned, it's the only one we need to consider.\n\nTherefore, based on the information in Row 1, the surface was indeed hard on 2 May 1999. So the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"mirielle dittmann be the opponent in the final on hard surface on 6 february 2000 in wellington new zealand.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down each part of the claim to check against the table.\n\n1. **Opponent's Name**: The claim mentions Mirielle Dittmann as the opponent in the final. I need to find any row where the opponent is Mirielle Dittmann.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n- Row 3: Opponent is Mirielle Dittmann.\n- Row 6: Also mentions Mirielle Dittmann.\n\n2. **Date**: The claim specifies the date as 6 February 2000. Let's check the dates in those rows.\n\n- Row 3 has Date: 6 February 2000.\n- Row 6 has Date: 6 February 2005, which is a different year.\n\nSo, only Row 3 matches the date mentioned.\n\n3. **Location**: The location is Wellington, New Zealand. Both rows 3 and 6 are in Wellington, but since we already matched the date to Row 3, that's our focus.\n\n4. **Surface Type**: The claim states it's a hard surface. Checking Row 3, Surface: hard. That matches.\n\n5. **Outcome**: The claim doesn't specify whether she was the winner or runner-up, just that she was the opponent in the final on those specific details.\n\nPutting it all together:\n- Opponent: Mirielle Dittmann (Row 3)\n- Date: 6 February 2000 (Row 3)\n- Location: Wellington, New Zealand (Row 3)\n- Surface: Hard (Row 3)\n\nAll the conditions in the claim are satisfied by Row 3. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent in final\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this table with ten rows of data about some tennis matches or something similar. Each row has details like the outcome, date, location, surface type, opponent in final, and the score. The claim is \"the surface be grass on 2 may 1999.\" My job is to check if that's true or false based on the table.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim correctly. It seems like it's saying that on May 2, 1999, the surface used was grass. So I have two things to verify: the date and the surface type.\n\nLooking at the table, there are ten rows, each representing a different match or event. Each row has a 'date' column and a 'surface' column. My task is to find the row where the date is \"2 may 1999\" and then check what the surface was on that date.\n\nStarting with Row 1: The date here is \"2 may 1999.\" That matches the claim's date. Now, I need to look at the 'surface' column in this row. According to the data provided, the surface for this row is listed as 'hard.' So, on May 2, 1999, the surface was hard, not grass.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there aren't any other rows with that date. Scanning through Rows 2 to 10, I don't see another entry with \"2 may 1999.\" So Row 1 is the only one with that specific date.\n\nTherefore, since the surface on May 2, 1999, was hard and not grass, the claim is incorrect. \n\nSo, compiling this information: the relevant cell is in row 0 (assuming rows are zero-indexed) under the 'surface' column because it directly relates to the claim about the surface type on that specific date.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that on May 2, 1999, the surface was grass. Checking Row 1 (row index 0), the date matches and the surface is listed as hard. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's see what the claim is. It says: \"the opponent in final on 6 February 2000 in Wellington New Zealand on hard surface be Katerina Kramperov\u00e1.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check each part of this claim against the table provided. The table has several rows, so I'll go through them one by one.\n\nLooking at the date first: 6 February 2000. Scanning the dates in the table, Row 3 is on 6 february 2000. That's a match. \n\nNext, location: Wellington, New Zealand. Yep, Row 3 also mentions Wellington, New Zealand. So that checks out.\n\nSurface type is hard. Row 3 says surface: hard, so that's correct too.\n\nNow, the opponent in final is supposed to be Katerina Kramperov\u00e1 according to the claim. Let me check what Row 3 says. Oh, it says the opponent was Mirielle Dittmann. So there's a discrepancy here because the claim mentions Katerina Kramperov\u00e1 instead.\n\nWait, maybe I should look elsewhere. Are there any other rows with Wellington and that date? No, Row 3 is the only one on 6 Feb 2000 in Wellington. \n\nLooking further down, Rows 8 and 9 are also in Wellington but different dates (February 2006). In Row 9, Katerina Kramperov\u00e1 is indeed an opponent, but that's on 12 February 2006, not 2000. So the claim has the wrong date for when she was the opponent.\n\nTherefore, the opponent in the final on 6 Feb 2000 was Mirielle Dittmann, not Katerina Kramperov\u00e1. The other details (date, location, surface) match Row 3 except for the opponent name.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE because it incorrectly identifies the opponent.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that on 6 February 2000 in Wellington, New Zealand, on a hard surface, the opponent was Katerina Kramperov\u00e1. Checking the table:\n\n- **Row 3** has the date 6 February 2000, location Wellington, New Zealand, surface hard.\n- However, the opponent listed is Mirielle Dittmann, not Katerina Kramperov\u00e1.\n\nThus, the claim incorrectly names the opponent for that specific match. The correct opponent was Mirielle Dittmann.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent in final\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
