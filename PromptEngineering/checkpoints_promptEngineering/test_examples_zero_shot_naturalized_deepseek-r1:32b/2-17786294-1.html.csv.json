    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says, \"as monaco score the most goal in the round of 16 in the 1983 - 84 coupe de france.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. Each row seems to represent a match between two teams, with details like team names, scores, and possibly the rounds they played. The columns are \"team 1\", \"score\", \"team 2\", \"1st round\", and \"2nd round\".\n\nThe claim is about AS Monaco scoring the most goals in the round of 16 during that specific Coupe de France season. I need to check if Monaco's total goals scored in both rounds of their match were the highest among all teams listed.\n\nLooking at Row 3: Team 1 is AS Monaco (d1) with a score of 6-1 against AS Nancy (d1). The 1st round was 2-0, and the 2nd round was 4-1. So, in total, Monaco scored 2 + 4 = 6 goals.\n\nNow I need to check other teams' goal totals from their matches. Let's go through each row:\n\nRow 1: RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg. The scores are 1-0 and 0-0. Total goals by RC Lens: 1 (from first round) + 0 (second round) = 1. But wait, team 2 is RC Strasbourg with a score of 0 in the first round but maybe scored in the second? Let me see. The \"score\" column for each row shows the total across both rounds. For Row 1, it's 1-0 overall, so team 1 (Lens) scored 1 goal in total. Team 2 (Strasbourg) scored 0.\n\nRow 2: FC Rouen vs Stade Lavallois. The score is 2-4. So FC Rouen scored 2 goals in total. Stade Lavallois scored 4, which is more than Monaco's 6? Wait no, because 4 is less than 6.\n\nRow 3: AS Monaco as discussed, 6 goals.\n\nRow 4: Girondins de Bordeaux vs FC Mulhouse (d2). The score is 2-3. So Bordeaux scored 2 in total, and Mulhouse scored 3. That's more than some teams but not higher than Monaco.\n\nRow 5: FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais. Score is 4-4. Each team scored 4 goals.\n\nRow 6: AS Cannes (d2) vs FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard (d1). The overall score is 4-1, so AS Cannes scored 4 in total, and Sochaux scored 1.\n\nRow 7: Sporting Toulon Var vs En Avant Guingamp. Score is 2-1. Total goals by Toulon Var: 2.\n\nRow 8: FC Metz vs Besan\u00e7on RC (d2). Score is 5-1, so Metz scored 5 in total.\n\nNow compiling all the goal totals for each team:\n\nAS Monaco: 6\nFC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnais: 4 each\nAS Cannes: 4\nFC Metz: 5\n\nWait, FC Metz scored 5 goals. That's more than FC Nantes and AS Cannes but less than Monaco's 6.\n\nSo the highest is Monaco with 6 goals in their two rounds. No other team in the table has a higher total. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"there be 2 scoreless legs - the second round of rc lens vs rc strasbourg, and the first round of fc nantes vs olympique lyonnais.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse each part of the claim.\n\n1. **Second round of RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg**: Looking at row 1, which involves RC Lens (team 1) and RC Strasbourg (team 2). The second round score is listed as 0-0. Since both scores are zero, this is a scoreless leg.\n\n2. **First round of FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais**: Checking row 5, where team 1 is FC Nantes and team 2 is Olympique Lyonnais (d2). The first round score is 0-0, which also means no goals were scored; hence, this is another scoreless leg.\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are satisfied as both rounds mentioned have scores of 0-0.

    "claim": "fc nantes and olympique lyonnaise tie on aggregate with a score of 4 - 4 , require the match to be decide by the away goal rule",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I need to determine if the claim about FC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnais is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, the claim states that they tied 4-4 on aggregate and required the away goal rule to decide the match. So, I need to check two main things: the aggregate score and whether it was a tie that would necessitate the use of the away goal rule.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match between two teams with their respective scores in the first and second rounds. The fifth row mentions FC Nantes (d1) vs Olympique Lyonnais (d2). Let's examine this row:\n\n- Team 1: FC Nantes (d1), Score: 4 - 4\n- Team 2: Olympique Lyonnais (d2)\n- 1st round score: 0 - 0\n- 2nd round score: 4 - 4\n\nThe total aggregate score is indeed 4-4 when combining both rounds. Now, regarding the away goal rule, this rule typically comes into play when two teams are tied on aggregate. It states that if one team has scored more goals away from home than the other, they win without needing extra time or a penalty shootout.\n\nLooking at the second round score: FC Nantes (home) 4 - Olympique Lyonnais (away) 4. Since it's a tie in both rounds, the aggregate is also tied. However, in this case, FC Nantes scored all their goals at home in the second round, while Olympique Lyonnais scored four away goals. Wait, no\u2014the scores for each round are per match. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the first round, it was 0-0. In the second round, it's 4-4. So overall, both teams have 4 goals in total. Now, to apply the away goal rule, we look at which team scored more goals away.\n\nLooking at each round:\n- First round: FC Nantes (home) vs Olympique Lyonnais (away): 0-0. No away goals here.\n- Second round: FC Nantes (home) again? Wait, no\u2014actually, the second round might be a reverse fixture where Olympique Lyonnais is at home.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me check how the matches are structured. In the table, each row represents a match between two teams with two legs (first and second rounds). So for FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais:\n\n- First round: 0-0. Since Olympique is d2, perhaps they were away in the first leg.\n- Second round: 4-4. Now, who was home here? The team listed as Team 1 is FC Nantes (d1), so likely they were at home in both legs.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because usually, in a two-leg match, each team hosts once. So perhaps the first leg was Olympique Lyonnais at home, and the second leg was FC Nantes at home. But looking at the table, for row 5:\n\n- Team 1: FC Nantes (d1), Score: 4 - 4\n- Team 2: Olympique Lyonnais (d2)\n- First round score: 0 - 0\n- Second round score: 4 - 4\n\nThis suggests that the first leg was a draw, and the second leg was also a 4-4 tie. So overall aggregate is 4-4. Now, who scored more away goals?\n\nIn the first leg (Team 1's home): FC Nantes as Team 1 would be at home, but the score is 0-0. Olympique Lyonnais was away and didn't score any.\n\nIn the second leg (Team 2's home? Or does Team 1 host both legs? Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the table is structured. The first round and second round might be separate matches where each team hosts once.\n\nBut in this case, since FC Nantes is d1 and Olympique is d2, maybe the first leg was at Olympique's home (d2), but according to row 5, it's 0-0 for the first round. Then the second leg is back at FC Nantes' place with a 4-4 score.\n\nSo in terms of away goals:\n- Olympique Lyonnais played as Team 2 in both legs? Wait, no\u2014the first leg would be Olympique at home (as d2) and the second leg FC Nantes at home (d1). But according to the table, it's just two rounds with scores, but the home/away isn't explicitly stated beyond team1 and team2.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps in each row, Team 1 hosts both legs? That would mean FC Nantes hosted both matches, which might not be standard. But regardless, looking at the aggregate score, it's 4-4, so they tied on points.\n\nNow, for the away goal rule to apply, one team must have scored more goals in their away game(s). Let's see:\n\nIf in the first leg (Team 2's home), Olympique was at home and FC Nantes were away. The score was 0-0, so no away goals there.\n\nIn the second leg (Team 1's home), FC Nantes scored 4 goals, and Olympique scored 4 as well. So Olympique scored 4 goals in their away game (second leg). Meanwhile, FC Nantes didn't score any away goals because both legs were at home for them? Wait, no\u2014if FC Nantes hosted both legs, then Olympique would have played two away games.\n\nWait, that can't be right because in a standard two-leg match, each team hosts once. So perhaps the first leg was at Olympique's place (Team 2) and the second at FC Nantes' place (Team 1). Therefore:\n\n- First leg: Olympique Lyonnais (home) vs FC Nantes (away): 0-0\n- Second leg: FC Nantes (home) vs Olympique Lyonnais (away): 4-4\n\nSo in this case, Olympique scored 4 goals away in the second leg. FC Nantes didn't score any away goals because their only away game was the first leg where they scored 0.\n\nTherefore, Olympique Lyonnais have 4 away goals, while FC Nantes have 0. So under the away goal rule, Olympique would win because they have more away goals than FC Nantes.\n\nBut wait, in reality, when teams are tied on aggregate, you look at away goals. If both scored equally at home and away, then it goes to extra time or penalties. But if one has more away goals, they win.\n\nIn this case, Olympique Lyonnais have 4 away goals (from the second leg) and FC Nantes have 0 away goals. Therefore, Olympique would win on away goals.\n\nHowever, in the table, it just shows the aggregate score as 4-4 without indicating a winner. So perhaps the match was decided by other means or went to penalties. But according to the data given, we only know the scores and that the aggregate is tied at 4-4.\n\nTherefore, yes, because Olympique Lyonnais scored more away goals (4) compared to FC Nantes who didn't score any away goals in their two matches, Olympique would have won via the away goal rule. So the final result after applying the away goal rule would be Olympique Lyonnais advancing.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check:\n\n- First leg: Olympique at home (as Team 2) vs FC Nantes away: 0-0. Olympique scored 0 away goals in this game because they were at home.\n- Second leg: FC Nantes at home (Team 1) vs Olympique away: 4-4. So Olympique scored 4 away goals here.\n\nThus, Olympique's total away goals are 4. FC Nantes played both games at home (assuming Team 1 hosts both legs), so their away goals would be from the first leg where they were away and scored 0.\n\nTherefore, Olympique has more away goals than FC Nantes, so they win on away goals.\n</think>\n\nThe match between FC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnais ended with an aggregate score of 4-4. Applying the away goal rule:\n\n1. **First Leg**: Olympique Lyonnais (home) vs FC Nantes (away) - Score: 0-0\n   - Olympique scored 0 goals away.\n2. **Second Leg**: FC Nantes (home) vs Olympique Lyonnais (away) - Score: 4-4\n   - Olympique scored 4 goals away.\n\n**Away Goals Calculation**:\n- Olympique Lyonnais: 4 away goals.\n- FC Nantes: 0 away goals.\n\nSince Olympique Lyonnais have more away goals, they advance based on the away goal rule.\n\n**Answer**: The final result is Olympique Lyonnais advancing with a score of \\boxed{Olympique\\ Lyonnais} after applying the away goal rule.",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"in the first leg, only 1 goal be scored by an away team: fc mulhouse score 1 against girondin de bordeaux.\" So, the key points here are that in the first round (leg), only one goal was scored by an away team, and that goal was by FC Mulhouse against Girondins de Bordeaux.\n\nNext, I'll look at the table provided. Each row represents a match between two teams with their respective scores and results from the first and second rounds.\n\nI need to identify which rows are relevant. Since the claim mentions the first leg (or round), I should focus on the \"1st round\" column across all rows. Additionally, I'll look for any away team goals in that specific round.\n\nLooking at each row:\n- Row 4: Team 1 is Girondins de Bordeaux (d1) and Team 2 is FC Mulhouse (d2). The first round score is 0 - 1. Here, the away team (FC Mulhouse) scored 1 goal.\n- I'll check other rows to ensure there are no other goals scored by away teams in their respective first rounds:\n   - Row 1: RC Strasbourg (away) vs RC Lens (home). First round score is 1-0. The away team scored 1 goal here as well.\n   - Wait, that's another goal by an away team in the first leg. So the claim states only FC Mulhouse scored a goal in the first leg, but Row 1 shows RC Strasbourg also scored a goal. That means there are at least two goals scored by away teams in the first round.\n\nWait, no, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check. The claim says \"only 1 goal be scored by an away team: fc mulhouse score 1 against girondin de bordeaux.\" So, according to this, only FC Mulhouse scored a goal in the first leg as an away team.\n\nBut looking at Row 1: Team 2 is RC Strasbourg (d1), playing away. The first round score is 0-1? Or wait, the table structure might be different. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no\u2014the way the table is structured for each row, \"team 1\" and \"team 2\" are the two opponents. So in Row 4: team 1 is Girondins de Bordeaux (d1), team 2 is FC Mulhouse (d2). The first round score is 0 - 1, meaning Girondins scored 0 and FC Mulhouse scored 1. Since FC Mulhouse is the away team here (as indicated by d2), they scored 1 goal in their first leg.\n\nNow, checking other rows for any goals scored by away teams in the first round:\n- Row 1: RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg. First round score 1 - 0. Team 2 (RC Strasbourg) is the away team here since they're listed as team 2 with d1. So RC Strasbourg, as the away team, scored 0 goals in their first leg.\n- Row 2: FC Rouen vs Stade Lavallois. First round score 1 - 0. Team 2 (Stade Lavallois) is away? Wait, but both are d1. So if they're both d1, maybe the designation isn't based on division but home/away. Alternatively, perhaps the first team listed is the home team. Let's assume that for each row, team 1 is the home team and team 2 is the away team.\n\nIf that's the case:\n- Row 1: RC Lens (home) vs RC Strasbourg (away). First round score 1 - 0. So the away team scored 0 goals.\n- Row 4: Girondins de Bordeaux (home) vs FC Mulhouse (away). First round score 0 - 1. Away team scored 1 goal.\n\nChecking other rows:\n- Row 2: FC Rouen (home, d1) vs Stade Lavallois (away, d1). First round score 1 - 0. So the away team didn't score.\n- Row 3: AS Monaco (home) vs AS Nancy (away). First round 2 - 0. Away team scored 0.\n- Row 5: FC Nantes (home, d1) vs Olympique Lyonnais (away, d2). First round 0 - 0. No goals by away team.\n- Row 6: AS Cannes (home, d2) vs FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard (away, d1). First round 3 - 0. Away team scored 0.\n- Row 7: Sporting Toulon Var (home, d1) vs En Avant Guingamp (away, d2). First round 2 - 0. Away team scored 0.\n- Row 8: FC Metz (home, d1) vs Besan\u00e7on RC (away, d2). First round 4 - 0. Away team didn't score.\n\nSo in the first leg across all matches, only FC Mulhouse as the away team scored a goal in their first leg. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because only one away team (FC Mulhouse) scored a single goal in the first leg.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that only FC Mulhouse scored 1 goal in the first leg as an away team. Checking each match's first round:\n\n- Row 4: Girondins de Bordeaux vs FC Mulhouse, first round score 0-1 (FC Mulhouse scored 1).\n- All other matches' first rounds either resulted in no goals by the away teams or had higher scores.\n\nThus, only one goal was scored by an away team in the first leg.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": \"The claim is correct. Only FC Mulhouse scored a goal as an away team in the first leg.\"\n}\n```\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Away Teams:** For each row, assume team 1 is home and team 2 is away.\n2. **Check First Round Scores for Away Goals:**\n   - Row 1: RC Strasbourg (away) scored 0.\n   - Row 4: FC Mulhouse (away) scored 1.\n   - Rows 2-8: No goals by other away teams in their first rounds.\n3. **Conclusion:** Only FC Mulhouse's single goal meets the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": \"true\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Only FC Mulhouse as an away team scored a goal (1) in the first leg.\"\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the highest scoring leg, and highest aggregate score for a match, total 8 goal, with fc nantes vs olympique lyonnaise\".\n\nFirst, let's break down the components of the claim:\n\n1. **Highest Scoring Leg**: This likely refers to a single leg (either the first or second round) where the most goals were scored in that particular match.\n\n2. **Highest Aggregate Score for a Match**: The total number of goals scored by both teams across both legs of a match.\n\n3. **Total 8 Goals**: The claim specifies that the highest aggregate is 8 goals, achieved by FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnaise.\n\nI'll start by examining each row to find which matches have the highest scoring legs and the highest aggregate scores.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- **Row 1**: RC Lens (D1) vs RC Strasbourg (D1)\n  - Score: 1 - 0\n  - First Round: 1 - 0, Second Round: 0 - 0\n  - Total goals per leg: First round has 1 goal, second round 0.

The highest aggregate is in Row 5, where FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais have a total of 8 goals (0-0 + 4-4).\n\nThe claim states that the highest scoring leg and the highest aggregate are both 8 goals for this match.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about FC Nantes and FC Mulhouse is true or false based on the table provided. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim again: \"FC Nantes and FC Mulhouse tie on aggregate with a score of 4-4, requiring the match to be decided by the away goal rule.\" \n\nI need to check two main things here:\n1. Did their aggregate score end up as 4-4?\n2. Was there a need for an away goal rule decision?\n\nLooking at the table, I see it has multiple rows with details about different matches. Each row lists Team 1 and Team 2 along with their scores in the first round and second round.\n\nI'll start by locating FC Nantes and FC Mulhouse in the table. \n\nScanning through the rows:\n- Row 5 mentions FC Nantes as Team 1, score 4-4 against Olympique Lyonnais (d2). The first round was 0-0, and the second round was 4-4.\n- Row 4 has Girondins de Bordeaux vs. FC Mulhouse. Here, Girondins scored 2-3 in total, with first round 0-1 and second round 2-2.\n\nWait a minute, so FC Nantes is playing against Olympique Lyonnais, not FC Mulhouse. And FC Mulhouse is playing against Girondins de Bordeaux. \n\nSo the claim mentions FC Nantes and FC Mulhouse as opponents, but according to the table, they are in separate matches. Therefore, their scores aren't directly tied against each other.\n\nBut let me double-check in case I missed something. Maybe there's another row where these two teams face each other? Looking again through all eight rows: No, FC Nantes is only listed once, and so is FC Mulhouse. They are both in different matches with different opponents.\n\nSo the claim incorrectly pairs them as opponents when they aren't. Therefore, their aggregate score of 4-4 isn't between each other but against other teams.\n\nThus, the claim is false because FC Nantes and FC Mulhouse didn't play against each other in these matches.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that FC Nantes and FC Mulhouse tied with a 4-4 aggregate. In reality, they were not opponents; FC Nantes faced Olympique Lyonnais (Row 5), while FC Mulhouse played Girondins de Bordeaux (Row 4).\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "as monaco score the few goal in the round of 16 in the 1983 - 84 coupe de france",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"as monaco score the few goal in the round of 16 in the 1983 - 84 coupe de france\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"AS Monaco.\" Looking at the table, I see a row where Team 1 is AS Monaco (D1) and they scored against AS Nancy (D1). The score is listed as 6 - 1. So, AS Monaco scored 6 goals in that match.\n\nNext, the claim refers to the \"round of 16.\" From the table, each row seems to represent a different round since it lists details like '1st round' and '2nd round.' The row with AS Monaco is under Row 3. Let me check if this row corresponds to the round of 16. Typically, in knockout tournaments, after initial rounds, you have the quarterfinals, then semifinals, etc., but sometimes the first few rounds can be considered qualifying or early stages before the main bracket.\n\nWait, actually, in Coupe de France, there are several rounds leading up to the final. The first round is usually Qualifying Round 1, followed by Qualifying Round 2, then the Main Draw (which includes the Round of 32, then Round of 16). However, looking at the table's structure, it seems each row has two rounds: '1st round' and '2nd round.' For example, Row 1 shows team 1 vs. team 2 with scores in both rounds.\n\nBut in this specific table, for AS Monaco (Row 3), the score is 6 - 1 overall, with a breakdown of 2-0 in the first round and 4-1 in the second round. So, perhaps these are two legs of a single match? Or maybe they played twice in different rounds.\n\nWait, the way it's structured, each row represents a team 1 vs. team 2 matchup across two rounds. For example, Row 3: AS Monaco (D1) vs. AS Nancy (D1), score overall is 6-1, with first round 2-0 and second round 4-1.\n\nSo, the total goals scored by AS Monaco in their match against AS Nancy are 6. Now, does this match belong to the Round of 16? The table doesn't explicitly state which rounds correspond to each row, but given that it's structured as two legs per matchup, perhaps these are the matches leading up to or part of the Round of 16.\n\nAlternatively, in some tournaments, a single-elimination format might have multiple rounds before reaching the final. If this is the case, then the Round of 16 would be an early stage, and the scores here could indeed be from that round.\n\nBut looking back at the claim: \"AS Monaco score the few goal.\" Wait, that doesn't make much sense grammatically. Maybe it's a mistranslation or typo. Perhaps it means AS Monaco scored few goals in the Round of 16? But according to the table, AS Monaco scored 6 goals in their match, which seems like a lot.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"the few goal\" is intended to mean they scored a specific number of goals, perhaps one. But 6 is quite high. So if the claim is that AS Monaco scored few (i.e., a low number) of goals in the Round of 16, but according to the table, they actually scored a lot, then the claim would be false.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting \"score the few goal.\" Perhaps it's meant to say they were the ones who scored the fewest goals overall in that round. But looking at other rows:\n\nRow 1: RC Lens vs. RC Strasbourg, total score 2-0\nRow 2: FC Rouen vs. Stade Lavallois, total score 6-4\nRow 3: AS Monaco vs. AS Nancy, total score 7-1 (6 by Monaco)\nRow 4: Girondins de Bordeaux vs. FC Mulhouse, total 5-3\nRow 5: FC Nantes vs. Olympique Lyonnais, total 8-8\nRow 6: AS Cannes vs. FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard, total 5-2\nRow 7: Sporting Toulon Var vs. En Avant Guingamp, total 3-1\nRow 8: FC Metz vs. Besan\u00e7on RC, total 6-1\n\nSo, the goals scored by each team in their matches vary. The claim says AS Monaco scored \"the few goal,\" which is unclear. If it's about them scoring a specific number (like only one), but they scored six, then it's false. Alternatively, if it's about them being the team with the fewest goals in that round, looking at all the scores, perhaps not.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me focus on the claim again: \"AS Monaco score the few goal in the round of 16.\" It might be a translation issue. Perhaps it means AS Monaco scored fewer goals than others in that round. But looking at the table, their total was 6-1, so they actually scored more than most other teams.\n\nWait no, each row is a match between two teams, and each team's score is given. So for AS Monaco, in their match against AS Nancy, they scored 6 goals across both rounds (2 + 4). If the claim is about the Round of 16, perhaps it's referring to their performance in that specific round.\n\nWait, but how are the rounds structured? The table shows each matchup as having two rounds: '1st round' and '2nd round.' For AS Monaco, they scored 2 goals in the first round and 4 in the second, totaling 6. If the Round of 16 is composed of these two legs, then their total might be considered for that stage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each team plays multiple rounds before reaching the final. But without more context on the tournament structure, it's hard to say exactly which round corresponds to the data in each row.\n\nHowever, given the information, if the claim is that AS Monaco scored few goals (like one or two) but they actually scored six, then the claim is false. Alternatively, if \"score the few goal\" means something else, like being the team with the fewest goals in the entire Round of 16, but looking at all teams:\n\nFrom Row 3: AS Monaco scored 6\nOthers:\nRow 1: RC Lens scored 2\nRow 2: FC Rouen 6-4 (they scored 6)\nRow 4: Girondins de Bordeaux 5-3 (they scored 5)\nRow 5: FC Nantes 8-8 (they scored 8)\nRow 6: AS Cannes 5-2 (they scored 5)\nRow 7: Sporting Toulon Var 3-1 (they scored 3)\nRow 8: FC Metz 6-1 (they scored 6)\n\nSo, among all teams in their respective matches, the lowest goals scored by a team in that round would be RC Lens with 2, and AS Monaco with 6. Therefore, if the claim is that AS Monaco scored few goals, meaning they were one of the lower scorers, it's not accurate because they actually scored quite a lot.\n\nBut wait, maybe \"score the few goal\" refers to them scoring in both rounds but being low per round? They scored 2 and 4, which are moderate numbers. But compared to others:\n\nRow 1: RC Lens 1st round score isn't given directly, but overall is 2-0\nRow 3: AS Monaco first round 2, second 4\n\nBut without more data, it's hard to say. However, based on the total goals per team in their matches, AS Monaco scored a significant number of goals.\n\nTherefore, if the claim is that they scored few goals (implying fewer than others), but in reality, they scored a lot, then the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"AS Monaco score the few goal in the round of 16.\" Based on the provided data:\n\n- AS Monaco's total score across both rounds against AS Nancy was 6 goals (2 in the first round and 4 in the second).\n- Comparing with other teams in their respective matches, several teams scored more or similar amounts.\n\nThe claim suggests that AS Monaco scored fewer goals than others, but they actually scored a significant number of goals. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because AS Monaco scored 6 goals in total, which was not few compared to other teams in the Round of 16.",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says there are two scoreless legs: specifically, the second round of RC Lens vs Olympique Lyonnais and the first round of FC Nantes vs RC Strasbourg.\n\nFirst, let me parse the table row by row to find these matches. \n\nLooking at Row 1: It's RC Lens (D1) vs RC Strasbourg (D1). The scores are listed as 1-0 overall. Then it breaks down into two rounds: 1st round is 1-0, and 2nd round is 0-0. So for RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg, the first round was 1-0, not scoreless. The second round was 0-0, which is a scoreless draw.\n\nNow, looking for Olympique Lyonnais: They are in Row 5 as team 2 against FC Nantes (D1). The overall score is 4-4. Breaking it down into two rounds: first round was 0-0 and second round was also 4-4. Wait, that doesn't seem right because the second round can't have a higher score than the first if it's cumulative. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again.\n\nWait, each row seems to represent a match between two teams across two rounds. So for Row 5: Team1 is FC Nantes (D1) and Team2 is Olympique Lyonnais (D2). The overall score is 4-4. Then it shows the first round as 0-0 and second round as 4-4. That would mean that in the second round, both teams scored 4 goals each. But I'm trying to find if any of these legs were scoreless.\n\nThe claim mentions the second round of RC Lens vs Olympique Lyonnais. Wait a minute, looking back at Row 1: it's RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg, not Olympique Lyonnais. So where is Olympique Lyonnais? They are in Row 5 as team2 against FC Nantes (team1). The second round of that match was 4-4, which isn't scoreless.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check each row again for Olympique Lyonnais. It's only present in Row 5. So the claim mentions RC Lens vs Olympique Lyonnais, but looking at all rows, RC Lens is only in Row1 against RC Strasbourg. There's no match between RC Lens and Olympique Lyonnais listed here.\n\nSo the first part of the claim refers to a second round that doesn't exist because those two teams didn't play each other according to the table. Therefore, there's no such leg as the second round between RC Lens and Olympique Lyonnais in this data.\n\nThe second part of the claim is about the first round of FC Nantes vs RC Strasbourg being scoreless. Looking at Row2: Team1 is FC Rouen (D1) vs Stade Lavallois (D1), so that's not relevant. The match between FC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnais is in Row5, where the first round was 0-0. But wait, FC Nantes is team1 against Olympique Lyonnais as team2. So their first round was 0-0, which is scoreless.\n\nBut according to the claim, it's FC Nantes vs RC Strasbourg. Let me check Row1 again: Team1 is RC Lens (D1) and Team2 is RC Strasbourg (D1). The first round was 1-0. So that leg wasn't scoreless.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the teams. The claim says \"the second round of rc lens vs olympique lyonnais\" but in our table, Olympique Lyonnais is only in Row5 against FC Nantes. There's no RC Lens vs Olympique Lyonnais match listed here. So that part of the claim isn't supported by the data.\n\nThe other part of the claim refers to \"the first round of fc nantes vs rc strasbourg.\" Looking at Row1: it's RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg, and their first round was 1-0, not scoreless. The FC Nantes match in Row5 is against Olympique Lyonnais, whose first round was 0-0.\n\nSo the claim mentions two legs that are supposed to be scoreless:\n\n1. Second round of RC Lens vs Olympique Lyonnais: Not present in the table.\n2. First round of FC Nantes vs RC Strasbourg: From Row1, it's 1-0, not scoreless.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misreading the teams. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at Row5: team1 is FC Nantes (D1) vs team2 Olympique Lyonnais (D2). First round was 0-0, which is scoreless. So that first round between FC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnais was indeed scoreless.\n\nBut the claim says \"fc nantes vs rc strasbourg.\" From Row1: RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg's first round was 1-0, not scoreless. So in the table, there is a scoreless leg (Row5, first round) between FC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnais, but not between FC Nantes and RC Strasbourg.\n\nSo the claim incorrectly states that both legs were scoreless when one of them isn't even present, and the other part refers to a non-scoreless match.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me list out all the first and second rounds:\n\nRow1: RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg\n- 1st round: 1-0 (not scoreless)\n- 2nd round: 0-0 (scoreless)\n\nRow5: FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais\n- 1st round: 0-0 (scoreless)\n- 2nd round: 4-4\n\nSo, in the table:\n\nScoreless legs are:\n- Row1's second round (RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg: 0-0)\n- Row5's first round (FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais: 0-0)\n\nBut the claim mentions:\n\n\"the second round of rc lens vs olympique lyonnais\" which isn't in the table.\n\nand\n\n\"the first round of fc nantes vs rc strasbourg\" which is Row1's first round (1-0), not scoreless.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect according to the data provided. The only scoreless legs are:\n\n1. RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg in their second round.\n2. FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais in their first round.\n\nBut these don't match the teams mentioned in the claim. So the claim is inaccurate based on the given table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim references two specific legs as being scoreless:\n\n1. The second round between RC Lens and Olympique Lyonnais: This match does not exist in the provided data, as Olympique Lyonnais only appears in a match against FC Nantes.\n\n2. The first round between FC Nantes and RC Strasbourg: According to the table, this leg resulted in a 1-0 scoreline, which is not scoreless.\n\nIn the given data:\n\n- The second round of RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg was scoreless (0-0).\n- The first round of FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais was scoreless (0-0).\n\nThus, neither part of the claim is accurate based on the provided information.",

    "claim": "in the first leg , only 2 be score by an away team : fc mulhouse score 1 against girondin de bordeaux",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's see what this claim is saying and how I can verify it against the table provided. The claim states: \"In the first leg, only 2 were scored by an away team: fc mulhouse scored 1 against girondin de bordeaux.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. Each row represents a match between two teams, with details about their scores in different rounds. The columns include team names, overall score, and the results of each round (1st and 2nd). \n\nThe claim is specifically talking about the first leg, which I assume refers to the first round of each match. It mentions that only two goals were scored by away teams in this first leg, and specifically highlights that FC Mulhouse scored one goal against Girondins de Bordeaux.\n\nLet me go through each row to check the scores from the away team's perspective in the first round.\n\nRow 1: RC Lens (d1) vs. RC Strasbourg (d1). The first-round score is 1-0. Since both are d1 teams, I'm not sure if one is home or away, but the claim doesn't mention this match, so probably irrelevant for now.\n\nRow 2: FC Rouen (d1) vs. Stade Lavallois (d1). First-round score is 1-0. Again, both are d1 teams; unsure about home/away.\n\nRow 3: AS Monaco (d1) vs. AS Nancy (d1). First-round score is 2-0. Both teams are in the same division, so perhaps not relevant unless one is an away team.\n\nRow 4: Girondins de Bordeaux (d1) vs. FC Mulhouse (d2). The first-round score here is 0-1. So, in this match, FC Mulhouse is likely the away team since they're from a lower division (d2). They scored 1 goal against Girondins.\n\nRow 5: FC Nantes (d1) vs. Olympique Lyonnais (d2). First-round score is 0-0. No goals here.\n\nRow 6: AS Cannes (d2) vs. FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard (d1). The first-round score is 3-0. Here, AS Cannes is d2 and might be the away team. They scored 3 goals, which is more than what the claim suggests.\n\nWait, but the claim says only 2 goals were scored by away teams in total across all matches. So if Row 6's away team (AS Cannes) scored 3 goals, that would already exceed the claimed total of 2. But perhaps I'm misunderstanding; maybe the claim is about each match having only a certain number of away goals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to the first leg in general, and whether only two goals were scored by all away teams across all matches in the first round.\n\nLet me re-examine each row's first-round scores:\n\nRow 1: Team 1 (RC Lens) score is 1-0. If RC Strasbourg is away, they scored 0.\n\nRow 2: FC Rouen 1-0 against Stade Lavallois. If Lavallois is away, they scored 0.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to determine which team is home and which is away. In the table, Team 1 might be the home team, as it's common in sports tables to list the home team first. So for each row, Team 1 is home, Team 2 is away.\n\nSo looking at the first round:\n\nRow 1: Team 1 (RC Lens) scored 1, Team 2 (Strasbourg) scored 0. So away team scored 0.\n\nRow 2: FC Rouen (home) 1, Stade Lavallois (away) 0. Away team scored 0.\n\nRow 3: AS Monaco (home) 2, AS Nancy (away) 0. Away team 0.\n\nRow 4: Girondins de Bordeaux (home) 0, FC Mulhouse (away) 1. So away team scored 1 here.\n\nRow 5: FC Nantes (home) 0, Olympique Lyonnais (away) 0. Away team 0.\n\nRow 6: AS Cannes (d2, perhaps home or away?) Wait, the teams are AS Cannes (d2) vs. FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard (d1). Assuming Team 1 is home, so AS Cannes is home, scored 3 in first round, and FC Sochaux (away) scored 0.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought because if AS Cannes is Team 1, then they are home. But the claim mentions FC Mulhouse as an away team scoring against Girondins de Bordeaux. \n\nRow 7: Sporting Toulon Var (d1) vs. En Avant Guingamp (d2). First round score is 2-0. So if Team 1 is home, they scored 2; away team (Guingamp) scored 0.\n\nRow 8: FC Metz (d1) vs. Besan\u00e7on RC (d2). First-round score is 4-0. Home team scored 4, away team 0.\n\nWait, that would mean the only away goal in the first round is from Row 4, where FC Mulhouse scored 1. So total away goals across all matches in the first leg would be 1. But the claim says \"only 2 were scored by an away team,\" which doesn't align because it's actually just 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at each row, for the first round (1st round), only the away team's score matters.\n\nRow 4: Girondins de Bordeaux vs FC Mulhouse. First-round score is 0-1. So FC Mulhouse (away) scored 1.\n\nAre there any other rows where the away team scored in the first round?\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 6: AS Cannes (d2, Team 1, so home) vs FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard (d1). First-round score is 3-0. Wait, but if FC Sochaux is Team 2, they are away and scored 0.\n\nSo no goals from away teams except Row 4's 1 goal.\n\nThus, the total away goals in first round across all matches would be just 1, not 2 as claimed. Therefore, the claim is incorrect unless I'm misinterpreting something.\n</think>\n\nThe initial analysis indicated that only one goal was scored by an away team in the first round of matches. However, upon re-examining the data:\n\n- In Row 4: Girondins de Bordeaux (home) vs FC Mulhouse (away), the score was 0-1. Thus, FC Mulhouse scored 1 goal as the away team.\n  \nThere were no other goals scored by away teams in the first round across all matches. Therefore, only one goal was scored by an away team in total during the first leg.\n\n**Answer:** Only one goal was scored by an away team in the first leg.",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the highest scoring leg, and highest aggregate score for a match, total 8 goal, with fc nantes vs besan\u00e7on rc.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what's being claimed here. It mentions two things: the highest scoring leg and the highest aggregate score. Both of these are supposed to be part of a single match between FC Nantes and Besan\u00e7on RC, totaling 8 goals.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details about both teams, their scores in each round, and the overall aggregate. The columns include team names, scores, and the two rounds of scoring.\n\nI'll go through each row to find where FC Nantes is involved. Scanning down, I see that Row 5 has team1 as FC Nantes (d1) and team2 as Olympique Lyonnais (d2). Their overall score is 4-4, which seems like a high aggregate but let me check the other rows.\n\nWait, actually, looking again at Row 8, it's FC Metz vs Besan\u00e7on RC. The overall score there is 5-1, which sums up to 6 goals. But the claim mentions FC Nantes vs Besan\u00e7on RC, so I need to find that specific match.\n\nHmm, in Row 5, team2 is Olympique Lyonnais, not Besan\u00e7on RC. So maybe the claim is mixing up teams? Or perhaps there's another row where Besan\u00e7on RC plays against someone else?\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. The table has rows from 1 to 8. Only Row 5 and Row 8 mention Besan\u00e7on RC. Wait no, actually looking back: Row 4 is Girondins de Bordeaux vs FC Mulhouse (d2), Row 5 is FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais, Row 6 is AS Cannes vs FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard, Row 7 is Sporting Toulon Var vs En Avant Guingamp, and Row 8 is FC Metz vs Besan\u00e7on RC.\n\nSo in the table, Besan\u00e7on RC only appears once as team2 in Row 8 against FC Metz. Their overall score is 5-1, which is a total of 6 goals, not 8.\n\nNow, looking at all rows for aggregate scores:\n\nRow1: 1-0 + 0-0 = 1 goal\nRow2: 2-4 (total 6), but the claim mentions 8.\nRow3: 6-1, which is 7 goals total. So that's higher than others except maybe Row5.\n\nRow4: 2-3, totaling 5 goals.\nRow5: 4-4, which totals 8 goals.\nRow6: 4-1, totaling 5.\nRow7: 2-1, totaling 3.\nRow8:5-1, totaling 6.\n\nSo the highest aggregate score is in Row5 with 8 goals (4-4). So that's a total of 8 goals. The claim says it's between FC Nantes vs Besan\u00e7on RC, but looking at Row5, it's against Olympique Lyonnais, not Besan\u00e7on RC. \n\nTherefore, the highest aggregate is indeed 8 goals, but it's in a different match than what the claim states. Additionally, checking for the highest scoring leg: each round is a leg. The first and second rounds are both legs.\n\nLooking at Row3, AS Monaco vs AS Nancy have scores of 2-0 in the first leg and 4-1 in the second leg. So each leg was 2-0 and 4-1. The highest scoring leg would be the second leg with 5 goals (4+1). However, other rows like Row3 have higher legs than others.\n\nWait, but in terms of aggregate, it's 6-1, which is 7 total. But the claim says that both the highest scoring leg and highest aggregate are for the same match, totaling 8 goals with FC Nantes vs Besan\u00e7on RC. \n\nSo to clarify:\n\n- The highest aggregate score is indeed 8 goals (4-4) in Row5, but it's between FC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnais, not Besan\u00e7on RC.\n\n- The claim mentions that both the highest scoring leg and highest aggregate are for this match with 8 total goals. Since the actual highest aggregate is 8, but against a different team than claimed, plus the highest leg in Row3 (4-1) isn't part of that 8-goal match, the claim is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n     {\"row__index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
