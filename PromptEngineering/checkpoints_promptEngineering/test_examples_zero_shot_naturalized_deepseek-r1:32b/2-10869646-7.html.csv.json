    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"geelong be the only team with less than 60 point\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table and check the scores of both the home and away teams to see which ones are below 60 points. The claim specifically mentions Geelong, so I should start with their score.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Geelong is the home team with a score of 9.5 (59). That's just under 60 points, so they meet the condition. Now, I need to check all other teams in every row to see if any have less than 60 points as well.\n\nRow 2: Home team Essendon has 15.15 (105) and away team Richmond has 16.19 (115). Both are way above 60, so no issues here.\n\nRow 3: South Melbourne scores 13.16 (94), and Melbourne has 11.10 (76). Again, both are well over 60 points.\n\nMoving to Row 4: St Kilda with 12.10 (82) and Collingwood with 11.22 (88). Both teams exceed 60 points as well.\n\nRow 5: Hawthorn has 13.22 (100), and Carlton scores 8.12 (60). Wait, Carlton's score is exactly 60. The claim says \"less than 60,\" so 60 doesn't count. Therefore, no problem here.\n\nFinally, Row 6: Footscray with 12.15 (87) and Fitzroy with 8.12 (60). Same as before, both are at or above 60 points.\n\nSo, after checking all rows, Geelong is the only team with a score below 60 points (59). No other teams meet this condition. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Geelong is the only team with less than 60 points. By examining each row, we confirm that Geelong's score of 59 is indeed the only one under 60.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"windy hill get the most point in the 1974 vfl season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each column represents. The table has rows for different matches with details like home team, their score, away team, their score, venue, crowd, and date. All dates are May 18, 1974, so it's a single day of games in the VFL season.\n\nThe claim is about \"windy hill\" getting the most points. From the table, I see that windy hill is listed under the \"venue\" column for row 2, which was a match between Essendon (home) and Richmond (away). \n\nI need to figure out what's meant by \"most point.\" It could refer to the highest score or perhaps the attendance. Looking at row 2: home team score is 15.15 (105), away is 16.19 (115). So Richmond scored more points in that game, but the venue itself doesn't accumulate points; it's where the game was held.\n\nWait, maybe \"windy hill\" refers to a team? Let me check all the home teams: Geelong, Essendon, South Melbourne, St Kilda, Hawthorn, Footscray. None of these are Windy Hill. It's listed as a venue, not a team. So Windy Hill isn't a team playing; it's just where one game took place.\n\nTherefore, the claim is about a venue getting points, which doesn't make sense because venues don't score points in football matches. Points are accumulated by teams, not venues. Hence, the claim is incorrect.\n\nTo verify this, I'll check each relevant cell:\n\n- Venue: windy hill (Row 2)\n- Home team score: 105\n- Away team score: 115\n\nBut since Windy Hill isn't a team, it can't have points. So the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to \"windy hill\" getting the most points, but windy hill is a venue, not a team.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Lake oval venue hold the least amount of crowd at 10239\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the table to find the information related to the venues and their respective crowds. The claim mentions Lake Oval specifically, so I should check which row has that venue. Scanning through the rows, Row 3 lists the home team as South Melbourne at Lake Oval with a crowd of 10239.\n\nNext, I need to verify if this is indeed the smallest crowd among all the venues listed on May 18, 1974. Let's check each venue's crowd:\n\n- Kardinia Park: 24685\n- Windy Hill: 24376\n- Lake Oval: 10239\n- Moorabbin Oval: 27876\n- Princes Park: 21202\n- VFL Park: 19450\n\nLooking at these numbers, the crowd sizes are as follows (sorted from smallest to largest):\n\n1. Lake Oval: 10239\n2. VFL Park: 19450\n3. Princes Park: 21202\n4. Windy Hill: 24376\n5. Kardinia Park: 24685\n6. Moorabbin Oval: 27876\n\nSo, Lake Oval has the smallest crowd with 10239 attendees. Therefore, the claim is correct.\n\nNow, I'll identify the relevant cells from the table that support this conclusion. The key information needed is the venue (Lake Oval) and its corresponding crowd number (10239). This data is found in Row 3 of the table under the columns \"venue\" and \"crowd\".\n\nPutting it all together, since Lake Oval indeed had the least crowd, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what each part of the table represents.\n\nFirst, looking at the table structure: Each row has details about a match between two teams\u2014home and away. The columns include home team, their score, away team, their score, venue, crowd size, and date. The scores are given in a format like 9.5 (59), which I assume is goals and behinds, with the total points in parentheses.\n\nThe claim mentions three teams scoring over 100 points. Since each match has two teams, I need to check both home and away team scores across all rows to see if any of them exceed 100 points.\n\nLet's go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Home team Geelong scored 59 points (9.5), Away team North Melbourne scored 90 points (13.12). Neither exceeds 100.\n2. **Row 2**: Home team Essendon with 105 points (15.15) and Away team Richmond with 115 points (16.19). Here, both teams exceed 100. So that's two teams already.\n3. **Row 3**: South Melbourne scored 94 points and Melbourne 76. Neither is over 100.\n4. **Row 4**: St Kilda with 82 and Collingwood with 88. Both under 100.\n5. **Row 5**: Hawthorn has 100 points (13.22), which is exactly 100, but the claim says over 100, so this doesn't count. Carlton scored 60, which is way below.\n6. **Row 6**: Footscray with 87 and Fitzroy with 60. Both under 100.\n\nWait, in Row 2, both Essendon (105) and Richmond (115) are over 100. So that's two teams. Now, looking at the other rows again to see if there's a third team that scored over 100.\n\nHmm, Row 5: Hawthorn scored exactly 100, which doesn't meet \"over\" 100. The others are all under. So only two teams in this table have scores over 100 points.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there aren't three teams that scored over 100 points in the given data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that three teams scored over 100 points.

The table has multiple rows, so I should look for the rows where either Richmond or Geelong are mentioned.\n\nLooking at Row 1: It shows Geelong as the home team with a score of 9.5 (59). So Geelong scored 59 points.\n\nNow, checking other rows to find Richmond. In Row 2, I see that Richmond is the away team against Essendon. Their score is 16.19 (115), so they scored 115 points.\n\nThe claim says Richmond acquired 56 more points than Geelong. To check this, I subtract Geelong's points from Richmond's: 115 - 59 = 56. That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 56 points in favor of Richmond over Geelong. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells for this are:\n- Row 1, where Geelong's score is listed.\n- Row 2, where Richmond's score is listed.\n\nI need to note their row indices and column names. In the table provided, each row starts with \"Row X:\", so I think the rows are zero-indexed or one-indexed? Wait, in the naturalized format given, the first row is referred as Row 1: which would be row index 0 if we're counting from zero. But looking back at the instructions, when they provided an example, it used row_index starting from 0. So in this case:\n\nRow 1 (Geelong) is actually row index 0.\nRow 2 (Richmond) is row index 1.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"} for Geelong's points.\n- {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"} for Richmond's points.\n\nThat should be enough to verify the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Richmond scored 56 more points than Geelong.

The claim says: \"the lake oval venue hold a crowd of 10239 crowd on march 1974 which be the most amount of crowd for a match.\"\n\nFirst, let me check each part of the claim against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows. Each row has details about different matches played on May 18, 1974. So all the dates in the table are from May 1974, not March as mentioned in the claim. That's one point of discrepancy.\n\nNow, checking for Lake Oval: In Row 3, the venue is Lake Oval. The crowd there was 10239 on May 18, 1974. But since the claim mentions March 1974, that date isn't present in any row of the table. So the date part doesn't match.\n\nNext, I need to verify if 10239 is indeed the highest crowd among all matches on May 18, 1974. Let's look at all the crowd numbers:\n\n- Row 1: 24685\n- Row 2: 24376\n- Row 3: 10239\n- Row 4: 27876\n- Row 5: 21202\n- Row 6: 19450\n\nThe highest crowd is in Row 4 with 27876 at Moorabbin Oval. So, Lake Oval's crowd of 10239 isn't the most; it's actually one of the lower crowds that day.\n\nTherefore, two issues make the claim false: the date is incorrect (March instead of May) and the crowd number for Lake Oval isn't the highest.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states both the date and the crowd count. The correct date in the table is May 1974, not March, and while Lake Oval did have a crowd of 10239 on that day, it wasn't the largest.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a specific claim about a table from the 1974 VFL season is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"windy hill be the venue be the most point be score in the 1974 vfl season and that number be 2 occur in june 1974.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim correctly. It seems a bit ungrammatical, but I'll try to understand it piece by piece. The first part says \"windy hill be the venue be the most point be score,\" which I interpret as meaning that Windy Hill is the venue where the highest points were scored in the 1974 VFL season. Then, the second part mentions that this number (the highest points) was achieved twice and occurred in June 1974.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are six rows, each representing a game on May 18, 1974. Each row includes details like home team, their score, away team, their score, venue, crowd, and date. The claim refers to events in June 1974, which isn't present in the given data; all entries are from May 18, 1974.\n\nSo, let's break down the claim into parts:\n\n1. **Venue with the most points scored:** \n   - We need to check each venue and calculate the total points for both home and away teams at that venue.\n   \n2. **Highest points number occurring twice in June 1974:**\n   - Since our data is only from May, we don't have any entries for June. Therefore, this part of the claim can't be supported by the given table.\n\nStarting with the first part about Windy Hill being the venue with the most points scored:\n\n- **Row 2:** Home team Essendon (15.15 = 105 points) vs. Away team Richmond (16.19 = 115 points). Total points at Windy Hill: 105 + 115 = 220 points.\n   \n- Comparing this to other venues:\n  - Kardinia Park (Row 1): Geelong (59) vs. North Melbourne (90) \u2192 Total 149\n  - Lake Oval (Row 3): South Melbourne (94) vs. Melbourne (76) \u2192 Total 170\n  - Moorabbin Oval (Row 4): St Kilda (82) vs. Collingwood (88) \u2192 Total 170\n  - Princes Park (Row 5): Hawthorn (100) vs. Carlton (60) \u2192 Total 160\n  - VFL Park (Row 6): Footscray (87) vs. Fitzroy (60) \u2192 Total 147\n\nSo, Windy Hill indeed has the highest total points at 220 compared to other venues.\n\nNow, for the second part of the claim: that this number (220 points) occurred twice in June 1974. However, all our data is from May 18, 1974, so there's no information about June matches. Therefore, we can't confirm that Windy Hill hosted another game with the same or any other point total in June.\n\nPutting it together:\n- The first condition (Windy Hill being the venue with the most points) is TRUE based on Row 2.\n- The second condition (this happening twice in June) is FALSE because there's no data for June.\n\nSince both parts of the claim must be true for the entire statement to be TRUE, and one part fails, the overall answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim has two parts. First, Windy Hill is correctly identified as having the highest points scored (220) in a single game on May 18, 1974. However, since there's no data for June 1974 in the table, we can't confirm that this occurred twice in June. Thus, the claim isn't fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says there are three teams that scored over 100 points in the 1974 season: footscray, hawthorn, and st kilda. It also mentions that all other teams scored only 50 points.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row of the table to check the scores.\n\nRow 1: Geelong (home) scored 9.5 which is 59 points. North Melbourne (away) scored 13.12 which is 90 points.\n- Neither team scored over 100.\n\nRow 2: Essendon (home) scored 15.15, totaling 105 points. Richmond (away) scored 16.19, totaling 115 points.\n- Both teams scored over 100. So that's two teams already beyond the claim which says only three.\n\nRow 3: South Melbourne (home) scored 13.16 for 94 points. Melbourne (away) scored 11.10, totaling 76 points.\n- No team here scored over 100.\n\nRow 4: St Kilda (home) scored 12.10, which is 82 points. Collingwood (away) scored 11.22, totaling 88 points.\n- Neither reached 100.\n\nRow 5: Hawthorn (home) scored 13.22 for 100 points exactly. Carlton (away) scored 8.12 for 60 points.\n- Hawthorn is at 100, which the claim says they are over 100, but it's actually exactly 100. Also, only one team here.\n\nRow 6: Footscray (home) scored 12.15 for 87 points. Fitzroy (away) scored 8.12 for 60 points.\n- Both under 100.\n\nNow, compiling the scores over 100:\n- Essendon: 105\n- Richmond: 115\n\nThe claim lists footscray, hawthorn, and st kilda as over 100. From the data:\n- Footscray scored 87 (Row 6)\n- Hawthorn scored exactly 100 (Row 5), which is not over 100\n- St Kilda scored 82 (Row 4)\n\nSo none of these three teams scored over 100. Instead, Essendon and Richmond did. The claim also says all other teams scored only 50 points, but looking at the data, most scores are above 50 except perhaps some away teams like Fitzroy with 60 in Row 6.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because it incorrectly identifies which teams scored over 100 and misrepresents the other teams' scores.\n</think>\n\nThe claim lists three specific teams as scoring over 100 points. Checking each team:\n\n- Footscray: 87 points\n- Hawthorn: 100 points (exactly, not over)\n- St Kilda: 82 points\n\nIn reality, Essendon and Richmond scored over 100.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"geelong be the only team that score less than 10 point in a home team score when every other team score 11 point\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim carefully. It says two things:\n1. Geelong scored less than 10 points at home.\n2. Every other team (except Geelong) scored at least 11 points when they were the home team.\n\nI'll check each row of the table to verify these conditions.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Home team is Geelong with a score of 9.5, which equals 59 points. The claim says less than 10 points. Wait, here I might have made a mistake because in Australian Rules Football, scores are typically represented as Goals.Behinds, where each goal is worth 6 points and behinds are 1 point. So Geelong's score of 9.5 translates to (9*6) + 5 = 54 + 5 = 59 points. The claim mentions \"less than 10 point\", which I think refers to less than 10 goals, not points. Or maybe it's a misinterpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the user meant less than 10 points in total? But that can't be right because each goal is 6 points, so even one goal would be 6 points. So perhaps they mean less than 10 goals.\n\nWait, but let me check: The claim says \"score less than 10 point\". That's grammatically incorrect; it should be \"points.\" Maybe the user meant that Geelong scored less than 10 goals in their home score. Or maybe it's about points. I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps they're referring to total points being under 10, but given the scores, that can't be because even 9.5 is 59 points.\n\nWait no, maybe \"score less than 10\" refers to goals, not points. So Geelong scored 9 goals as the home team. Let me check each row's home team score:\n\nRow 1: Geelong - 9.5 (goals.behinds)\nRow 2: Essendon - 15.15\nRow 3: South Melbourne -13.16\nRow4: St Kilda -12.10\nRow5: Hawthorn -13.22\nRow6: Footscray -12.15\n\nSo, the claim is that Geelong is the only home team with less than 10 goals (i.e., 9 or fewer), while all other home teams scored at least 11 points? Or perhaps 11 goals? Wait, no. The second part says \"every other team score 11 point.\" Again, it's likely a typo for \"points,\" but in terms of total points.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: the claim is about home team scores. So each row has a home team and their score (goals.behinds) converted into points.\n\nThe claim says:\n- Geelong scored less than 10 points as the home team.\n- Every other home team scored at least 11 points.\n\nWait, but looking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Geelong's total is 59 points. So that's way more than 10 points. So if the claim is that Geelong scored less than 10 points as a home team, that's false because they scored 59.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's referring to goals only (the first number). So:\n\nRow 1: Geelong - 9 goals\nRow2: Essendon -15\nRow3: South Melbourne -13\nRow4: St Kilda -12\nRow5: Hawthorn -13\nRow6: Footscray -12\n\nSo, in terms of goals:\n- Geelong has 9 goals (less than 10)\n- All others have more than or equal to 11? Wait:\n\nEssendon:15, South Melbourne:13, St Kilda:12, Hawthorn:13, Footscray:12.\n\nSo the other home teams have at least 12 goals except for St Kilda and Footscray who have 12. So all other home teams (except Geelong) have more than or equal to 12 goals, which is above 10. Therefore, if the claim refers to goals:\n\n- Geelong:9 <10\n- Others:15,13,12,13,12 >=11?\n\nWait, no. The second part says \"every other team score 11 point.\" Again, it's unclear. If they mean points, then looking at the total points:\n\nRow1: Geelong -59\nOthers:\nEssendon:105 (15*6 +15=90+15=105)\nSouth Melbourne:13*6 +16=78+16=94\nSt Kilda:12*6 +10=72+10=82\nHawthorn:13*6 +22=78+22=100\nFootscray:12*6 +15=72+15=87\n\nSo total points:\n\nGeelong:59 (Row1)\nOthers:\nEssendon:105 >59\nSouth Melbourne:94>59\nSt Kilda:82>59\nHawthorn:100>59\nFootscray:87>59\n\nSo if the claim is that Geelong scored less than 10 points (which would be impossible as they have 59), but perhaps it's about goals. Alternatively, maybe \"less than 10\" in terms of total score? No, because all are way higher.\n\nWait, I think there might be a confusion here. Let me read the claim again: \"geelong be the only team that score less than 10 point in a home team score when every other team score 11 point\"\n\nSo perhaps it's referring to the total points being under 10 for Geelong and over 11 for others.\n\nBut looking at the table, all teams have way more than 10 points as home teams. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"less than 10\" in goals (the first number), so:\n\nGeelong:9 goals\nOthers:\nEssendon:15>10\nSouth Melbourne:13>10\nSt Kilda:12>10\nHawthorn:13>10\nFootscray:12>10\n\nSo yes, Geelong has 9 (less than 10), and all others have more than or equal to 12. So perhaps the claim is that Geelong is the only home team with less than 10 goals, while others have at least 11.\n\nBut in reality:\n\n- Geelong:9\n- Others: Essendon(15), South Melbourne(13), St Kilda(12), Hawthorn(13), Footscray(12)\n\nSo yes, all others have more than or equal to 12. So the claim is correct if it's about goals.\n\nBut wait, let me see: The claim says \"score less than 10 point\" which probably meant points, but in reality, they scored 59 points. So perhaps the user made a typo and meant goals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's referring to something else. But considering the data, if we consider goals:\n\n- Geelong is the only home team with less than 10 goals (they have 9), others have more than that.\n\nBut according to the claim: \"Geelong be the only team that score less than 10 point in a home team score when every other team score 11 point\"\n\nIf we interpret it as:\n\n- Geelong's home score is less than 10 (goals)\n- Others' home scores are at least 11 (goals)\n\nWhich would mean:\n\nGeelong:9 <10\nOthers:15,13,12,13,12 >=11\n\nYes, that holds.\n\nBut the way it's written is confusing. It says \"less than 10 point\" which is probably a typo for points, but if we take it as goals, it makes sense.\n\nSo to answer: The task is to verify whether Geelong is the only home team with less than 10 goals (which they are) and all other home teams have at least 11 goals. But looking at the data:\n\n- Essendon:15\n- South Melbourne:13\n- St Kilda:12\n- Hawthorn:13\n- Footscray:12\n\nAll of these are >=12, which is more than 11.\n\nSo in that sense, yes, Geelong is the only home team with less than 10 goals (they have 9), and all others have at least 12, which satisfies \"every other team score 11\" if we consider it as goals. But since the claim says \"less than 10 point\", perhaps points were intended.\n\nBut given that Geelong has 59 points, which is more than 10, the only way the claim makes sense is if they're talking about goals.\n\nSo to proceed, assuming the claim refers to goals:\n\n- Geelong:9 <10\n- Others: >=12\n\nTherefore, the statement holds true. So when the user says \"You are tasked...\", I need to explain this in a step-by-step manner.\n</think>\n\nThe task is to determine whether Geelong is the only home team that scored less than 10 goals, while all other home teams scored at least 11 goals. \n\nHere's the analysis:\n\n1. **Geelong's Performance**:\n   - Home Score: 9.5 (goals.behinds)\n   - Goals: 9 (less than 10)\n\n2. **Other Home Teams' Performances**:\n   - Essendon: 15.15 \u2192 15 goals\n   - South Melbourne: 13.16 \u2192 13 goals\n   - St Kilda: 12.10 \u2192 12 goals\n   - Hawthorn: 13.22 \u2192 13 goals\n   - Footscray: 12.15 \u2192 12 goals\n\nAll other home teams have scored at least 12 goals, which satisfies the condition of scoring more than 10 goals.\n\n**Conclusion**: Geelong is indeed the only home team with less than 10 goals (9), and all others have met or exceeded 11 goals. Therefore, the claim holds true when interpreted in terms of goals scored. \n\nAnswer: The statement is accurate as it pertains to goals; Geelong's home score was under 10 goals, while all other teams had at least 12 goals.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"richmond acquire 56 point more than geelong who score 1000 point while at the vfl park venue.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into parts.\n\n1. Richmond acquired 56 points more than Geelong.\n2. Geelong scored 1000 points.\n3. This happened at VFL Park venue.\n\nI'll check each part against the table data step by step.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 1: Home team is Geelong, score 9.5 (59). Away team is North Melbourne, score 13.12 (90). Venue is Kardinia Park. So Geelong's score here is 59 points, not anywhere near 1000.\n\nRow 6: Footscray vs Fitzroy at VFL Park. The scores are 12.15 (87) for Footscray and 8.12 (60) for Fitzroy. So VFL Park's game didn't involve Geelong or Richmond in this row.\n\nRichmond is listed as the away team in Row 2, where they played against Essendon at Windy Hill. Their score was 16.19 (115). Essendon's score was 15.15 (105). So Richmond scored 115 points, and Geelong isn't even in this row.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"Geelong who score 1000 point.\" That seems way too high compared to the scores in the table. In Row 1, Geelong scored 59 points. Even if we look at other rows, the highest score is 16.19 (115) by Richmond.\n\nSo the claim that Geelong scored 1000 points is definitely incorrect. Also, Richmond isn't in a game where they scored 56 more than Geelong since Geelong's score was 59 and Richmond's was 115 elsewhere, but not against each other.\n\nAdditionally, VFL Park venue doesn't have any game involving both Richmond and Geelong as per the table. So all parts of the claim are false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Geelong did not score 1000 points, Richmond didn't acquire 56 more points than them in this context, and the venue mentioned isn't where they played against each other.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
