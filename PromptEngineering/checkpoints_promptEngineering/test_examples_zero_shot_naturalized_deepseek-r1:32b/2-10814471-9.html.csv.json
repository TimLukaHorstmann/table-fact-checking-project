    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"tevita vaikona score 100 point on 25 tries\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through each part of the claim step by step.\n\nFirst, I should find the row where Tevita Vaikona is listed. Looking at the rows, Row 2 has \"tevita vaikona\". So that's our relevant row.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific pieces of information: points (100) and tries (25). Let me check these in the table.\n\nFor points, I'll look at the \"points\" column for Tevita Vaikona. According to Row 2, his points are listed as 100. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nNext, checking the number of tries. In the same row, under the \"tries\" column, it says he has 25 tries. This also matches what the claim states.\n\nSince both the points and the number of tries in the table match the numbers given in the claim, there's no discrepancy here. Therefore, the claim is accurate based on the data provided.\n\nI should note that while other players have similar points or tries, the specific combination for Tevita Vaikona aligns perfectly with the claim. There's no conflicting information elsewhere in the table that would suggest otherwise.\n\nSo, putting it all together, both pieces of information from the claim are correctly represented in the table. Thus, the answer is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"tevita vaikona be the only player to score at least 100 points when make more than 23 tries.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It says that Tevita Vaikona is the only player who scored at least 100 points and also made more than 23 tries. So there are two conditions here: one about the number of points (at least 100) and another about the number of tries (more than 23). And Tevita Vaikona should be the only one meeting both conditions.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to check if any other players besides Tevita meet these criteria. Let's start with Row 1: Robbie Paul has 92 points and 23 tries. He doesn't meet the points condition because it needs to be at least 100.\n\nNext is Row 2, which is about Tevita Vaikona himself. He has 100 points and 25 tries. So he meets both conditions: more than 23 tries (since 25 > 23) and at least 100 points.\n\nMoving on to other players. Row 3: Leon Pryce with 64 points and 16 tries doesn't meet either condition. Similarly, Row 4 has Nathan McAvoy with 16 points and 4 tries\u2014way below both thresholds.\n\nRow 5 is Michael Withers. He has 124 points, which meets the points condition, but his tries are 31. Wait, that's more than 23 as well. So he has both over 100 points and more than 23 tries. Oh wait, does this mean Tevita isn't the only one? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the claim says \"make more than 23 tries\"\u2014so 24 or above. Michael Withers has 31 tries, which is indeed more than 23. His points are 124, which is at least 100. So he also meets both conditions. That means Tevita isn't the only one; Michael does too.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any other players. Let's go through all rows just to be thorough.\n\nRow 6: Henry Paul has 457 points but his tries are 9. So he doesn't meet the tries condition. Similarly, Row 7: Paul Deacon with 86 points and 6 tries\u2014doesn't fit.\n\nRow 8: Joe Vagina has 8 points and 2 tries\u2014nope. Row 9: James Lowes with 53 points and 13 tries\u2014not enough.\n\nRow 10: Paul Anderson has 32 points and 8 tries\u2014again, no. Row 11: Daniel Gartner has 56 points and 14 tries\u2014still not meeting either condition.\n\nRow 12: Mike Foshaw with 24 points and 6 tries. No. Row 13: Lee Gilmour with 32 points and 8 tries\u2014doesn't meet.\n\nRow 14: Shane Rigon has 48 points and 12 tries. Nope. Row 15: Alex Wilkinson with 0 points and 0 tries, so no.\n\nRow 16: Lee Radford has 8 points and 2 tries\u2014no. Row 17: Jamie Peacock with 32 points and 8 tries\u2014doesn't fit.\n\nRow 18: Scott Naylor has 56 points and 14 tries\u2014not enough. Row 19: Brian McDermott with 12 points and 3 tries\u2014nope.\n\nRow 20: Graham Mackay has 50 points, which is below 100, so even though he has 12 tries (which is more than 23? Wait, no. He has 12 tries, which is less than 23. So that's not meeting the second condition either.\n\nRow 21: Paul Sykes with 0 points and 0 tries\u2014doesn't matter. Row 22: Rob Parker same as above.\n\nRow 23: Stuart Spruce has 24 points and 6 tries\u2014no. Row 24: Stuart Fielden with 12 points and 3 tries\u2014doesn't fit.\n\nWait a second, so the only other player besides Tevita that meets both conditions is Michael Withers? So the claim says Tevita is the only one, but actually there's another player who also does. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nBut hold on, in Row 5, Michael has 31 tries and 124 points\u2014yes, that's definitely meeting both. So, I think that means the claim isn't correct because Michael also meets the criteria.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Tevita Vaikona is the only player with at least 100 points and more than 23 tries. However, upon reviewing all players in the table, Michael Withers also meets both conditions (124 points and 31 tries). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"result\": \"false\"\n}\n```",
