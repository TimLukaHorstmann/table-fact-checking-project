    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"princess louise do not married until she be around 38 year old\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the table to find the entry for Princess Louise. Scanning the rows, I see that Row 5 mentions \"louise, princess royal 1867-1931\". So that's the relevant row.\n\nNow, the claim states that she didn't marry until she was around 38 years old. To check this, I need to find her date of marriage and calculate her age at that time. Looking at Row 5, the \"date married\" is listed as 1889. \n\nHer birth year is 1867, so subtracting that from 1889 gives us 22 years old when she got married. The claim says she was around 38, which is significantly older than 22. Therefore, the claim doesn't hold true based on the data provided.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are the \"name dates\" to identify her and the \"date married\" to determine her age at marriage.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Princess Louise didn't marry until she was around 38 years old. From the table, she married in 1889 at age 22, making the claim FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date married\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"princess mary marry william ii before she be 12\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the table to find any princess named Mary. Scanning the rows, I see that row 1 has a name: Mary, and row 6 also mentions Mary as well. \n\nLooking at row 1: The details say that Princess Mary was born in 1631 and married William II in 1641. So her age when she got married would be 1641 minus 1631, which is 10 years old. Wait, but the claim says \"before she be 12,\" so 10 is before 12, right? That makes it true.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there's another Mary in the table. Row 6 has Princess Mary as well, born in 1897 and married in 1922. So her age at marriage would be 1922 minus 1897, which is 25 years old. But since William II isn't her husband (her husband was Henry Lascelles), this row doesn't apply to the claim about William II.\n\nSo focusing back on row 1: Mary married William II at age 10, which is definitely before she turned 12. That seems to confirm the claim as true. I don't see any conflicting information in other rows that would change this conclusion.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Princess Mary married William II when she was 10 years old, which is before turning 12.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"},\n     {\"row_1\": 1631, \"column_name\": \"date married\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nWait, I need to correct the relevant cells. The row indices start from 0, so row 1 is index 0? Wait no, in the table provided earlier, Row 1 was order:1, which would be index 0 if we're zero-indexing. Let me adjust that.\n\nBut looking back at how rows are presented:\n\nRow 1: order: 1\nRow 2: order: 2\n...\nSo in the JSON response, row_index should correspond to the actual row number starting from 0 or 1? The example given starts with row_index:0 as \"Revenue\" and row_index:1 as \"Employees\". So I think it's zero-based.\n\nBut wait, the table in the problem is presented as Row 1, Row 2,... so when referring to them in JSON, perhaps they are considered as 1-based? Or maybe not. The example in instructions uses row_index starting at 0. Let me check:\n\nIn the user message, under \"Instructions\", the example given for \"relevant_cells\" has {\"row_index\": 0, ...}, which corresponds to Row 1.\n\nWait no, in the example, it's about a different table with columns like Revenue and Employees, so perhaps row indices are 0-based. So in our case, Row 1 is index 0.\n\nBut looking at the data:\n\nRow 1 (order:1) would be index 0.\n\nSo for Princess Mary who married William II, that's in row 1 of the table as presented, which is order:1. So in JSON, it should be row_index:0.\n\nSimilarly, her marriage date is 1641, so age 10.\n\nWait no, but looking at the data structure, each row has \"name dates\" and \"date married\". So for row 1 (index 0), name dates are Mary born in 1631. Date married: 1641.\n\nSo she was 10 years old when she married William II. Thus, the claim is TRUE because 10 < 12.\n\nRelevant cells would be her birth year and marriage date from row 1.\n\nSo the relevant_cells should include:\n\n- row_index 0, column \"name dates\" (to get her birth year)\n- row_index 0, column \"date married\" (to get the year she married)\n\nThus, the JSON answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date married\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nWait, but in the data structure, is there a column named \"age\"? No, so we have to calculate it from birth year and marriage date. But since the JSON only asks for which cells are relevant, not how to compute.\n\nSo yes, those two columns in row 0 are needed to determine her age at marriage.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Princess Mary married William II before turning 12 is TRUE based on the information provided in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date married\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"princess anne of elizabeth the ii have have 2 husband\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the table and the claim step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, each row represents a princess royal with various details like name, dates, parent, date married, and husband's details. The rows are ordered from 1 to 8, but I notice that row 7 and 8 both have the same order number, which is 7. That might be a mistake, but for now, I'll focus on the content.\n\nThe claim is about Princess Anne of Elizabeth II having two husbands. So, I need to find if Princess Anne in the table has been married twice. Let's scan through the rows.\n\nRow 1: Mary, daughter of Charles I. Not relevant.\nRow 2: Anne, princess royal from 1709-1759, parent George II. This is a different Anne, not Elizabeth II's daughter.\nRows 3 to 6: Charlotte, Victoria, Louise, and another Mary. These don't match Anne of Elizabeth II.\n\nLooking at Row 7 and 8: Both are about Anne, princess royal from 1987-present, daughter of Elizabeth II. That's the correct Anne we're looking for.\n\nIn row 7: She was married in 1973-1992 to Mark Phillips. Then, in row 8: She remarried in 1992 to Sir Timothy Laurence.\n\nSo, Princess Anne has two marriages as per the table: first to Mark Phillips from 1973 to 1992, and then to Sir Timothy Laurence starting in 1992. Therefore, she indeed had two husbands.\n\nThe relevant cells are the husband dates in both row 7 and 8. For row 7, it's under \"husband dates\" where Mark Phillips is listed with his lifespan, and for row 8, it's Sir Timothy Laurence. So these are the relevant cells that support the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"princess anne of elizabeth be the only princess of the list to have get a divorce\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the table carefully to understand the structure and data presented. The table lists eight rows, each corresponding to a different Princess Royal with various details about their lives. Each row includes information such as order number, name and dates, period they were Princess Royal, parent's details, date married, and husband's details.\n\nThe claim in question is that Princess Anne of Elizabeth is the only one on the list to have gotten a divorce. To verify this, I need to check each princess's marriage status, specifically looking for any indication of divorce or separation.\n\nStarting with Row 1: Mary, her husband is William II, Prince of Orange, and there\u2019s no mention of a divorce here. She was married in 1641, so assuming the relationship continued until his death in 1650.\n\nRow 2: Anne's marriage details show she was married in 1734 to William IV, with his dates from 1711-1751. No indication of divorce here either; likely remained married until his death.\n\nRow 3: Charlotte married in 1797 to Frederick I of W\u00fcrttemberg, who died in 1816. Again, no mention of divorce.\n\nRow 4: Victoria was married in 1858 to Frederick III, German Emperor, who passed away in 1888. No signs of divorce here.\n\nRow 5: Louise married Alexander Duff in 1889, and he died in 1912. There's no indication she divorced; it seems they were together until his death.\n\nRow 6: Mary married Henry Lascelles in 1922. He passed away in 1947, so again, no mention of divorce here.\n\nNow, looking at Row 7 and Row 8, both pertain to Princess Anne, daughter of Elizabeth II. In Row 7, she was married from 1973 to 1992 to Mark Phillips. The end date suggests a separation or divorce around that time. Then in Row 8, she remarried Timothy Laurence in 1992. \n\nSo, Princess Anne has two marriage entries: one ending in 1992 and another starting the same year with her second husband. This indicates that her first marriage ended, likely through divorce, allowing her to remarry.\n\nChecking the other princesses again, none have such a change or end date in their marriage that suggests a divorce; all marriages seem to have ended only by the death of the spouse.\n\nTherefore, Princess Anne is indeed the only one listed who experienced a divorce. This makes the claim TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by examining each princess's marital history. Only Princess Anne has a marriage ending (1973-1992) followed by another marriage, indicating a divorce.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date married\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date married\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"prince mary of charles i die before age 40\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the components of the claim. The subject here is a person named Prince Mary who is associated with Charles I. The claim states that this individual died before the age of 40. \n\nLooking at the table provided, each row lists information about different princesses royal and their details. Let's examine each row to see if there's someone named Mary related to Charles I.\n\nStarting from Row 1: It mentions \"mary\" as the name, with parent Charles I (1600-1649). The princess was born in 1631 and died in 1660. So her lifespan is 1631-1660. Now, wait\u2014the claim refers to a prince named Mary, but the table lists her as \"princess royal.\" That might be a bit confusing since Mary could have been a princess, not a prince. But perhaps it's a typo or gender-neutral title usage.\n\nNext, let's calculate how old she was when she died. She was born in 1631 and died in 1660. Subtracting 1631 from 1660 gives us 29 years. So Mary would have been 29 years old at the time of her death. Since 29 is less than 40, that seems to support the claim.\n\nBut wait a second\u2014the claim says \"prince mary.\" The table lists her as a princess, not a prince. Could this be an error? Maybe it's a mistake in the title, or perhaps the name refers to someone else. Let me check other rows just to make sure there isn't another Mary associated with Charles I.\n\nLooking at Row 6: There's another Mary listed, but her parent is George V (1865-1936). That's a different era, so she can't be the one referred to in the claim about Charles I. Rows 2 through 5 don't mention any other Marys.\n\nSo focusing back on Row 1: The relevant cells are \"name dates\" which is Mary, and \"date married\" is 1641. Wait, no\u2014the death date is actually in the \"princess royal from (date) to (date)\" field, which ends in 1660, indicating her death year.\n\nWait, but looking again at Row 1: The \"name dates\" are mary, princess royal 1631-1660. So she died in 1660 at age 29. That's definitely before 40. \n\nNow, the claim refers to her as a prince. But in the table, she is listed as a princess. Is there any other Mary who was a prince? Let me check if any of the other entries have a different title or role.\n\nLooking through all rows, it seems that all are princesses except for some husbands who are princes or kings. So perhaps the claim has a mix-up in titles. But since Mary is listed as dying at 29, which is before 40, regardless of her title, the age part holds true.\n\nTherefore, even though she's referred to as a princess, not a prince, the key fact here is that she died before 40. So the claim is TRUE based on the information given in Row 1.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to \"prince mary of charles i\" dying before age 40. The table shows Mary (Row 1) as princess royal with death year 1660, born in 1631. She died at 29, which is under 40. Despite the title mix-up, her age meets the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"princess royal from (date) to (date)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"princess mary marry her husband william ii after her 12th birthday\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which row in the table corresponds to Princess Mary. Looking at the rows:\n\nRow 1: Mary, Princess Royal from 1642-1660.\nRow 6: Mary, Princess Royal from 1932-1965.\n\nSo there are two entries for Mary. The claim mentions William II as her husband, so I'll check both rows to see who their husbands were.\n\nIn Row 1, under \"husband dates,\" it's William II, Prince of Orange (1626-1650). That matches the name in the claim. So this is the relevant row for the princess Mary and her marriage to William II.\n\nNext, I need to find out when Princess Mary was born and when she married. From Row 1:\n\n- Name dates: Mary, 1631-1660.\n- Date married: 1641.\n\nSo her birth year is 1631, and she married in 1641. To find out if she was older than 12 when she married, I subtract her birth year from the marriage year: 1641 - 1631 = 10 years old.\n\nWait, that means she was only 10 years old when she married. The claim says \"after her 12th birthday,\" which would mean she should be at least 13 or older. But according to the table, she was 10 when she married William II. \n\nSo this makes the claim FALSE because she married before turning 12.\n\nNow, for Row 6's Mary: Her husband is Henry Lascelles, not William II, so that row isn't relevant here. Thus, only Row 1 matters.\n\nTo summarize:\n- Relevant cells are from Row 1.\n- The name dates and date married columns show she was 10 when married, which contradicts the claim of being older than 12.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date married\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim \"princess louise marry edward vii before the age of 20\" is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is saying. The subject here is Princess Louise, and the action is that she married Edward VII before she was 20 years old. So I'm looking for information about when Princess Louise got married and how old she was at that time.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several rows with different princesses. Since the claim mentions Princess Louise, I should find her in the table. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Mary\n- Row 2: Anne\n- Row 3: Charlotte\n- Row 4: Victoria\n- Row 5: Louise\n- Row 6: Mary\n- Rows 7 and 8: Anne\n\nSo, Princess Louise is in Row 5. Let me look at the details for her.\n\nIn Row 5, under \"name dates,\" it says \"louise , princess royal 1867 - 1931.\" So her birth year is 1867 and death year is 1931. Her parent is Edward VII, as listed in the \"parent\" column: \"edward vii 1841 - 1910.\"\n\nNext, I need to find when she got married. The \"date married\" column for Row 5 shows \"1889.\" So Princess Louise married in 1889.\n\nNow, let's calculate her age at the time of marriage. She was born in 1867, so subtracting that from the marriage year: 1889 - 1867 = 22 years old. Wait, but that would make her 22 when she married. However, wait a second\u2014maybe I need to consider the exact months or whether it's before her birthday in 1889. The table doesn't specify the exact date beyond the year, so we can only go by the years.\n\nIf she was born in 1867 and married in 1889, at the earliest, she could have been just over 21 if her birthday is after the marriage date. But since we don't have the months, it's safest to say she was about 22 years old when she married.\n\nWait, but hold on\u2014Edward VII is listed as her parent? That seems off because Edward VII was born in 1841 and became king in 1901, reigning until his death in 1910. If Princess Louise is his daughter, that would make sense. But wait, looking again at Row 5: \"parent: edward vii 1841 - 1910.\" So Edward VII is her father.\n\nNow, the claim says she married Edward VII before the age of 20. Wait a minute\u2014Edward VII was her father, not someone she would marry. That seems contradictory. Did I misread that?\n\nWait no, looking back at the table: Row 5's \"parent\" is Edward VII, so he is her parent, but the claim says she married Edward VII. That can't be correct because you can't marry your own father. So perhaps there's a mistake in the claim? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait no, let me check again. The claim says \"princess louise marry edward vii before the age of 20.\" But according to the table, Edward VII is her parent. Therefore, she can't have married him because that would be impossible\u2014marrying your own father isn't feasible. So there's a mistake in the claim.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm mixing up Edward VII and another person? Let me check Row 5 again: \"parent: edward vii 1841 - 1910.\" Yes, that's correct. So Edward VII is her father, not someone she married.\n\nBut then, in the \"husband dates\" column for Row 5, it says \"alexander duff , 1st duke of fife 1849 - 1912.\" So Princess Louise married Alexander Duff, not Edward VII. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because she didn't marry Edward VII at all; he was her father.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding\u2014maybe the claim meant that she married someone else, and they are claiming it's Edward VII. But according to the table, her husband is Alexander Duff. So the claim is wrong in two ways: first, she didn't marry Edward VII (he was her father), and second, even if we ignore that, she was 22 when she married, which is over 20.\n\nSo putting it all together: The claim states that Princess Louise married Edward VII before age 20.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"princess anne of elizabeth be 1 of 3 princess on the list who have a divorce\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The key points are:\n1. Princess Anne is one of three princesses in the list.\n2. These three princesses have experienced a divorce.\n\nI need to verify each part using the data from the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it's organized with rows representing different princess royals, each having details like order, name, dates, parent, marriage date, and husband's details. The relevant columns here would be \"name dates\" for identifying each princess and the \"date married\" or any indication of divorce in their marital status.\n\nStarting with Princess Anne, as she is specifically mentioned. From row 7, we see that Princess Anne was born in 1950 and became princess royal from 1987 to present. Her first marriage was to Mark Phillips from 1973 to 1992, which indicates a divorce. She remarried Sir Timothy Laurence in 1992. So, she has been married twice, implying one divorce.\n\nNext, I'll check each row for any mention of multiple marriages or specific divorces. The table doesn't explicitly state \"divorced\" but the presence of two husbands suggests a divorce. Let's examine all princesses:\n\n- Row 1: Mary, married in 1641 to William II. Only one husband listed; no indication of divorce.\n- Row 2: Anne, married in 1734 to William IV. One husband; no divorce indicated.\n- Row 3: Charlotte, married in 1797 to Frederick I. One husband; no divorce.\n- Row 4: Victoria, married in 1858 to Frederick III. One husband; no divorce.\n- Row 5: Louise, married in 1889 to Alexander Duff. One husband; no divorce.\n- Row 6: Mary, married in 1922 to Henry Lascelles. One husband; no divorce.\n- Rows 7 and 8: Both refer to Princess Anne, showing two marriages with different husbands, indicating one divorce.\n\nFrom this analysis, only Princess Anne has a recorded divorce as per the data provided. The claim states that she is one of three princesses with a divorce, but based on the table, there's only one instance of divorce. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because only Princess Anne has a recorded divorce, making her the sole princess with such an experience in the list.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date married\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date married\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "princess mary of charles i die before she turn 25",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"princess mary of charles i die before she turn 25\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that Princess Mary, who is a daughter of Charles I, died before turning 25 years old. So, I need to find her in the table and check her death date as well as calculate if she indeed passed away before reaching 25.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it's structured into rows with various details about each princess. Each row includes information such as order, name, dates, title duration, parent, marriage details, and husband's info. \n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to identify which one corresponds to Princess Mary who is the daughter of Charles I. Scanning Row 1: It mentions \"mary\" with the parent being Charles I (1600-1649). That seems to be the correct entry since it's the first row and directly links Mary to Charles I.\n\nFrom Row 1, the details are as follows:\n- Name dates: mary, princess royal from 1631-1660\n- Parent: Charles I (1600-1649)\n- Date married: 1641\n- Husband: William II, Prince of Orange (1626-1650)\n\nSo, the relevant details here are Mary's lifespan and her parent. The claim is about her dying before turning 25, so I need to find out when she was born and when she died.\n\nWait a minute, the table doesn't explicitly state the birth year of Princess Mary in Row 1. It only provides her name and the years associated with her title as princess royal (1631-1660). However, since Charles I was married to Henrietta Maria, their daughter Mary was born on April 28, 1631. That's a known historical fact not explicitly stated in the table, but perhaps it's implied by the \"name dates\" as princess royal starting from 1631.\n\nIf we take that Mary was born in 1631 and died in 1660, then she lived until age 29 (since 1660 minus 1631 is 29 years). Therefore, she did not die before turning 25; instead, she lived well beyond that.\n\nBut wait, the table might have her lifespan in another column. Let me check again: The \"name dates\" for Row 1 are \"mary , princess royal 1631 - 1660\". This likely indicates that she was princess royal from 1631 to 1660, but her actual birth and death years might be different. However, without explicit birth and death years, it's a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, the \"parent\" column shows Charles I died in 1649, so if Mary was born in 1631, she would have been 18 when her father died in 1649. The princess royal title duration is from 1642 to 1660, which might suggest that she held the title until 1660 but wasn't necessarily born in 1642.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"name dates\" are her lifespan? So Mary was princess royal from 1631-1660, meaning she was named as such when she was very young. But her actual birth year is likely around 1631, making her die in 1660 at age 29.\n\nGiven that, the claim says she died before turning 25, which would mean dying by 1656 (if born in 1631). Since she actually died in 1660, which is beyond 25 years old, the claim should be FALSE.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are from Row 1: \"name dates\" and \"princess royal from (date) to (date)\" as they provide her lifespan and the duration of her title, helping determine her age at death.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"princess royal from (date) to (date)\"}\n   ]\n}",
