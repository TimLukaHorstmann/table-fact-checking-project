    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the first place tie be betweem duffy waldorf , jeff sluman and frank nobilo\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. Each row has information about a player's rank (place), name, country, score, to par, and money.\n\nThe claim mentions that Duffy Waldorf, Jeff Sluman, and Frank Nobilo are tied for first place. To verify this, I need to check their respective rows in the table.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 9: Place t9, Player Jeff Maggert\n- Row 10: Place t9, Player Frank Nobilo\n- Row 11: Place t9, Player Jeff Sluman\n- Row 12: Place t9, Player Duffy Waldorf\n\nEach of these players is listed in rows 9 to 12. The place for each is \"t9\", which I assume stands for tied at 9th position. \n\nNow, checking the claim against this information: the claim says they are tied for first (place), but according to the table, all three are actually tied for 9th place.\n\nAdditionally, looking at rows 1-3, players like Ernie Els, Colin Montgomerie, and Loren Roberts are in a tie for first place (\"t1\"). These are the actual top positions.\n\nTherefore, the claim incorrectly states that Duffy Waldorf, Jeff Sluman, and Frank Nobilo are tied for first when they are actually tied for ninth. \n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are the \"place\" column for each of these three players. Each is in row 9 (Jeff Maggert), row 10 (Frank Nobilo), row 11 (Jeff Sluman), and row 12 (Duffy Waldorf). All show place as t9.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
