    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim is: \"In Karachi, Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera have 437 runs.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided. There are ten rows, each representing a different match with various details like wicket number, runs, battling partners, teams, venue, and season.\n\nThe key elements in the claim are:\n1. Location: Karachi\n2. Battering Partners: Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera\n3. Runs: 437\n\nI'll go through each row to see if any match these criteria.\n\nLooking at Row 4: The venue is Karachi, so that's a potential match. Let me check the batting partners here. They are Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera, which matches exactly what the claim states. Now checking the runs, it says 437 runs in this row. That aligns perfectly with the claim.\n\nSo all the elements of the claim are present in Row 4:\n- Venue: Karachi\n- Battering Partners: Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera\n- Runs: 437\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the information in the table. I don't see any discrepancies or missing pieces here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"battling partners\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"runs\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"in 1997, roshan mahanama and sanath jayasuira do not battle\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It states that in the year 1997, Roshan Mahanama and Sanath Jayasuriya were not batting partners. So I need to check if there was a row where these two were battling in 1997. If such a row exists, the claim would be FALSE; otherwise, it's TRUE.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 2 mentions Roshan Mahanama and Sanath Jayasuriya as batting partners for Sri Lanka against India in Colombo during the season 1997. So this directly contradicts the claim because they did battle together that year.\n\nTherefore, since the claim says they do not battle in 1997, but according to row 2, they did, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells are in row 2 for the columns 'battling partners', 'season'.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Row 2 shows that Roshan Mahanama and Sanath Jayasuriya were batting together in 1997.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"battling partners\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"season\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"mahela jayawardene and thilan samaraweera have 195 run together , in karachi\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find any mention of Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera as batting partners. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Doesn't mention either.\n- Row 2: No, it's about Roshan Mahanama and Sanath Jayasuriya.\n- Row 3: Mahela is here with Kumar Sangakkara.\n- Row 4: Ah, here we go. The batting partners are Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera. Let me note this down as row index 3 (since rows start at 0). \n\nNow, checking the runs column for this row. It says runs: 437. But the claim states 195 runs. That's a discrepancy because 437 doesn't match 195.\n\nNext, looking at the venue. The claim mentions Karachi. In row 4, the venue is Karachi. So that part matches.\n\nBut wait, the runs don't add up. Also, let me check other rows to see if there's another instance of these two batting partners elsewhere. \n\nLooking again:\n\n- Row 5: Different players.\n- Row 6: Mahela with Prasanna Jayawardene.\n- Rows 7-10: No mention of both names together.\n\nSo the only row where both are together is row 4, but the runs are 437 instead of 195. Therefore, the claim's run total doesn't match what's in the table. Even though the venue matches, the number of runs doesn't. So the claim isn't fully supported.\n\nHence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera scored 195 runs together at Karachi. The relevant data is found in row 4, which shows they batted together for 437 runs at Karachi, not 195.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"battling partners\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"runs\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
