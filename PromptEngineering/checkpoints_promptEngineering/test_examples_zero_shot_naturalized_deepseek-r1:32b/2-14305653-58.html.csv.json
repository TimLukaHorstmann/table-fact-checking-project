The claim states: \"the yugoslavian national team win both of its friendly match by a score of 2:1.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which rows in the table are relevant. The claim mentions two friendly matches, so I'll look for rows where the 'type of game' is 'friendly'. \n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: date: march 22, city: sarajevo, opponent: uruguay, results: 2:1, type of game: friendly.\n- Row 3: date: april 26, city: borovo, opponent: poland, results: 2:1, type of game: friendly.\n\nSo rows 0 and 2 (assuming zero-based indexing) are the friendly matches. Now, I need to check if both were won by Yugoslavia with a score of 2:1.\n\nIn Row 1 (index 0), the result is 2:1, which means Yugoslavia scored 2 goals and the opponent scored 1. So they won this match.\n\nRow 3 (index 2) also has a result of 2:1, so again, Yugoslavia won with the same score.\n\nI should ensure that these are the only friendly matches in the table. Checking all rows:\n\n- Row 2 is a Balkan Cup game.\n- Rows 4 and 5 are WCQ games.\n- Rows 6 and 7 are also WCQ games.\n\nOnly two friendly matches, both with results of 2:1 wins for Yugoslavia. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me read through the claim carefully.\n\nThe claim states: \"the yugoslavian national team suffer its worst outcome lose 1:4 in the balkan cup against romania on august 27\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the key points from the claim:\n\n1. The opponent is Romania.\n2. The result was a loss with the score 1:4 (Yugoslavia lost 1-4).\n3. The type of game was the Balkan Cup.\n4.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a table with several rows of data about the Yugoslavian national team's matches. The claim is that they lost the Balkan Cup against Romania with an aggregate score of 3:4. My task is to verify if this claim is true or false based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each column represents and how the data is structured. The columns are date, city, opponent, results, and type of game. Each row corresponds to a specific match with details filled under these columns.\n\nThe claim mentions two key points: \n1. The type of game was the Balkan Cup.\n2. The result against Romania was a loss with an aggregate score of 3:4.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan each row to find matches where the opponent is Romania and the type of game is Balkan Cup. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nRow 1: Opponent is Uruguay, not Romania. So this doesn't apply.\nRow 2: Opponent is Romania and the type is Balkan Cup. The result here was a win with 2:0.\nRow 4: Again, opponent is Romania, type is Balkan Cup. This time, the result was a loss with 1:4.\n\nNow, the claim talks about an aggregate score of 3:4. An aggregate usually refers to combining results from two legs or matches in a competition. So I need to check if there are multiple matches between Yugoslavia and Romania in the Balkan Cup.\n\nFrom the table, there's only one match against Romania in the Balkan Cup (Row 2) with a result of 2:0, which is a win. There's another match in Row 4 where they lost 1:4, but this seems to be a separate game. Wait, are these two legs of the same competition? The claim suggests that both games contribute to an aggregate score.\n\nIf we consider Rows 2 and 4 as two legs of the same Balkan Cup series against Romania, then adding up the goals:\n\nFirst leg (Row 2): Yugoslavia 2 - Romania 0\nSecond leg (Row 4): Yugoslavia 1 - Romania 4\n\nAggregate score would be (2+1) : (0+4) = 3:4. This matches the claim exactly.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the total goals from both matches against Romania in the Balkan Cup sum up to a 3-4 loss for Yugoslavia.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"type of game\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"type of game\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n   ]\n}\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"type of game\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"type of game\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"the yugoslavian national team fail to score only 1 time, drop a world cup qualify match 0:2 against italy.\" So there are two parts here. The first part says they failed to score only once. The second part mentions that in a World Cup qualifier (WCQ) match against Italy, they lost 0:2.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to identify all the matches played by Yugoslavia and check their results. Let's go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: March 22, Sarajevo vs Uruguay. Result is 2:1. So Yugoslavia scored twice here. They didn't fail to score here.\n\nRow 2: March 30, Belgrade vs Romania in the Balkan Cup. Result is 2:0. Again, they scored two goals. No failure here either.\n\nRow 3: April 26, Borovo vs Poland. Another friendly match with a result of 2:1. They scored twice again, so no issue here.\n\nRow 4: August 27, Bucharest vs Romania in the Balkan Cup. Result is 1:4. They scored once here. Still, they did score, just not as many as their opponents.\n\nRow 5: September 10, Luxembourg vs Luxembourg. Result is 5:0. Yugoslavia won this one with five goals. Clearly, they scored a lot in this match.\n\nRow 6: September 27, Ljubljana vs Denmark. Result is 2:1. Another win with two goals scored.\n\nRow 7: November 15, Torino (Italy) vs Italy. Result is 0:2. This is the World Cup qualifier mentioned in the claim. Here, Yugoslavia failed to score as they lost 0:2 against Italy.\n\nNow, focusing on whether Yugoslavia failed to score only once. From the table, I can see that in all other matches except for row 7, they scored goals. In row 7, their result is 0:2, meaning they didn't score at all. So this would be one instance where they failed to score.\n\nWait a minute, but let me check each match again:\n\n- Row 1: 2 goals\n- Row 2: 2 goals\n- Row 3: 2 goals\n- Row 4: 1 goal\n- Row 5: 5 goals\n- Row 6: 2 goals\n- Row 7: 0 goals\n\nSo, only in row 7 did they fail to score. That's just one instance, which matches the claim that they failed to score only once.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions that this was a World Cup qualifier against Italy with a result of 0:2, which is exactly what row 7 shows. So both parts of the claim are accurate based on the table.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"type of game\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim about the Yugoslavian national team's performance in the 3 matches for the 1982 World Cup qualifiers is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim: \"the yugoslavian national team score 7 goal and allow 3 against in the 3 1982 world cup qualify match.\"\n\nSo, it's saying that in three matches related to the 1982 World Cup qualifiers (wcq), Yugoslavia scored a total of 7 goals and conceded 3.\n\nLooking at the table, I should find all rows where the type of game is '1982 wcq'. From the table:\n\nRow 5: September 10, Luxembourg - results 5:0. So, they scored 5, allowed 0.\nRow 6: September 27, Ljubljana vs Denmark - results 2:1. Scored 2, allowed 1.\nRow 7: November 15, Torino vs Italy - results 0:2. Scored 0, allowed 2.\n\nSo that's three matches in total for the qualifiers.\n\nNow, let's sum up the goals scored and conceded:\n\nGoals scored:\nRow 5: 5\nRow 6: 2\nRow 7: 0\nTotal scored = 5 + 2 + 0 = 7\n\nGoals allowed:\nRow 5: 0\nRow 6: 1\nRow 7: 2\nTotal allowed = 0 + 1 + 2 = 3\n\nSo the claim says they scored 7 and allowed 3, which matches exactly.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE.

Yugoslavia played two friendly matches.\n2. In both matches, they won with a score of 0:2.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find the relevant data.\n\nRow 1: date march 22, city sarajevo, opponent uruguay, result 2:1, type friendly. So, it's a friendly match where Yugoslavia scored 2 and Uruguay 1. Result is a win for Yugoslavia with a score of 2-1.\n\nRow 3: date april 26, city borovo, opponent poland, result 2:1, type friendly. Again, a friendly match where Yugoslavia won 2-1 against Poland.\n\nNow, checking the claim's specifics:\n\nThe claim states both friendly matches were won with a score of 0:2. But looking at the results from rows 1 and 3, the scores are 2:1 in each case. So Yugoslavia didn't lose; they actually won both friendlies with a higher score.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the claim. It says \"win both... by a score 0:2.\" That would mean they lost both games because 0 is less than 2. But that contradicts the results in the table where Yugoslavia scored more goals each time. So the claim seems incorrect on two counts:\n\n- They didn't lose both; they won both.\n- The scores were not 0:2 but 2:1 in both cases.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells are from rows 1 and 3 where the type of game is friendly, and their results.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim first.\n\nThe claim says: \"the yugoslavian national team lose the italy against romania with a aggregate score of 3:4\"\n\nWait, that phrasing seems off. It mentions \"lose the italy\" which doesn't make much sense. Maybe it's supposed to say \"lose against Italy\"? Or perhaps there's a typo. Alternatively, maybe they meant that Yugoslavia lost in a game involving both Italy and Romania? Hmm, but looking at the table, I don't see any games where Yugoslavia played both Italy and Romania together. So perhaps the claim is misphrased.\n\nLooking back, the claim might be trying to say that Yugoslavia lost against Romania with an aggregate score of 3:4. But in the table, let's check the relevant rows for matches against Romania.\n\nRow 2: March 30, Belgrade vs Romania, result 2:0 (Yugoslavia won)\nRow 4: August 27, Bucharest, Romania vs Yugoslavia again, result 1:4. Wait, no, the opponent is Romania, and the results are 1:4. So the score here is 1 for Romania, 4 for Yugoslavia? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, looking at row 4: city is Bucharest, Romania; opponent is Romania, so the home team would be Romania, and the result is 1:4. That means Romania scored 1, Yugoslavia scored 4? So Yugoslavia won that match.\n\nWait, but the claim says they lost against Romania with an aggregate of 3:4. But in both games against Romania (rows 2 and 4), Yugoslavia won both. So how can there be a loss?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is talking about a different context, like a two-legged tie? The table shows two matches against Romania: March 30 (row 2) and August 27 (row 4). If we consider these as home and away games in a qualifier, perhaps.\n\nWait, row 2: Yugoslavia vs Romania at Belgrade, result 2:0 (Yugoslavia's win)\nRow 4: Romania vs Yugoslavia at Bucharest, result 1:4. Wait, that seems like a high score for a return leg. If it's a two-legged tie, the aggregate would be 2+4=6 for Yugoslavia and 0+1=1 for Romania. So Yugoslavia won both legs with an aggregate of 6-1.\n\nBut the claim says they lost against Romania with an aggregate of 3:4. That doesn't match because in reality, Yugoslavia won both matches, so there's no loss involved.\n\nWait another thought: maybe the claim is mixing up different opponents or games? Let me check all the rows again.\n\nRow 5: September 10 vs Luxembourg, result 5-0 (Yugoslavia win)\nRow 6: September 27 vs Denmark, result 2-1 (Yugoslavia win)\nRow 7: November 15 vs Italy in Torino, result 0-2 (Yugoslavia lost)\n\nSo the only loss Yugoslavia had was against Italy with a score of 0-2.\n\nThe claim mentions losing to Romania with an aggregate of 3-4. But according to the table, that's not accurate because they won both games against Romania. The only loss was against Italy in a friendly game where they lost 0-2.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect. They didn't lose against Romania; they lost against Italy.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Yugoslavia lost against Romania with an aggregate score of 3:4. However, according to the table, Yugoslavia won both matches against Romania (rows 2 and 4) with scores 2:0 and 1:4 respectively.

They lost a World Cup qualifier (WCQ) match 2-1 against Denmark.\n\nLet me check each point using the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row and note the relevant information.\n\nStarting with the first part: failing to score only once. To find this, I need to look for matches where Yugoslavia scored zero goals. \n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Results are 2-1 (scored 2)\n- Row 2: 2-0 (scored 2)\n- Row 3: 2-1 (scored 2)\n- Row 4: 1-4 (scored 1)\n- Row 5: 5-0 (scored 5)\n- Row 6: 2-1 (scored 2)\n- Row 7: 0-2 (scored 0)\n\nSo, in row 7, Yugoslavia scored 0. That's one instance where they failed to score. Are there any others? Let me double-check each result:\n\n- Row 1: 2\n- Row 2: 2\n- Row 3: 2\n- Row 4: 1\n- Row 5: 5\n- Row 6: 2\n- Row 7: 0\n\nOnly row 7 has a score of 0. So the first part of the claim is correct; they failed to score only once.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: dropping a World Cup qualifier match 2-1 against Denmark.\n\nI need to find a WCQ match where Yugoslavia lost 2-1 to Denmark.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 5: Opponent Luxembourg, type WCQ. Result 5-0 (win).\n- Row 6: Opponent Denmark, type WCQ. Result 2-1. Wait, the result is 2:1 in favor of Yugoslavia because they scored 2 and the opponent 1? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, the table shows \"results\" as \"5:0\", \"2:1\", etc., which I assume means Yugoslavia's goals first, then the opponent's. So for row 6:\n\nOpponent Denmark, result 2:1. That means Yugoslavia scored 2 and Denmark scored 1, so they won 2-1.\n\nBut the claim says they lost 2-1 against Denmark in a WCQ match. If it was a loss, the result would be 1:2 from Yugoslavia's perspective.\n\nLooking at row 6 again, it's 2:1 in favor of Yugoslavia. So they actually won that match, not lost.\n\nIs there any other WCQ match where they lost to Denmark?\n\nChecking all rows:\n\n- Row 5: vs Luxembourg, result 5-0 (Yugoslavia win)\n- Row 6: vs Denmark, result 2-1 (Yugoslavia win)\n- Row 7: vs Italy, type WCQ? Wait, row 7 is in the format \"torino , italy\", opponent Italy. The type of game is \"1982 wcq\". Result is 0-2, so Yugoslavia lost this match.\n\nBut that's against Italy, not Denmark. So they did lose a WCQ match, but it was against Italy, not Denmark.\n\nSo the claim says they dropped (lost) a WCQ match 2-1 against Denmark, but according to row 6, they won 2-1 against Denmark in a WCQ match. Therefore, this part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the result? Let me check again:\n\nRow 6: Results are 2:1. If it's Yugoslavia vs Denmark, then 2 is Yugoslavia's score, and 1 is Denmark's. So Yugoslavia won that match.\n\nSo the claim is wrong on two counts: they didn't lose to Denmark in a WCQ; instead, they won. Also, their only failed scoring was against Italy, not Denmark.\n\nBut wait, the first part of the claim says \"failed to score only once.\" From the table, that's correct because row 7 is the only instance where they scored zero.\n\nSo combining both parts:\n\n- Failed to score only once: TRUE\n- Lost a WCQ match 2-1 against Denmark: FALSE (they won 2-1)\n\nSince the claim combines both points as if they are facts, but one part is false, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells would be row 6 and row 7. Row 6 for checking the result against Denmark in a WCQ match, and row 7 to confirm when they failed to score.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about the Yugoslavian national team's performance in the 1982 World Cup qualifiers is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"the yugoslavian national team score 7 goal and allow 3 against in the 2 1982 world cup qualify score.\" It seems a bit jumbled, but I think it means that Yugoslavia scored 7 goals and conceded 3 goals across their two matches in the 1982 World Cup qualifiers.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a match. The columns are date, city, opponent, results, and type of game. The relevant part here is the \"type of game\" column to identify which matches were part of the 1982 WCQ (World Cup Qualifiers).\n\nSo, I need to find all rows where the type of game is '1982 wcq'. Let me check each row:\n\n- Row 5: September 10 in Luxembourg vs. Luxembourg, result 5:0, type '1982 wcq'.\n- Row 6: September 27 in Ljubljana vs. Denmark, result 2:1, type '1982 wcq'.\n- Row 7: November 15 in Torino vs. Italy, result 0:2, type '1982 wcq'.\n\nWait, that's three rows with the type '1982 wcq', not two as mentioned in the claim. Hmm, that might be a discrepancy already.\n\nNow, for each of these matches, I'll extract the goals scored by Yugoslavia and the goals conceded (opponent's goals).\n\nRow 5: Result is 5:0. So Yugoslavia scored 5, allowed 0.\nRow 6: Result is 2:1. Yugoslavia scored 2, allowed 1.\nRow 7: Result is 0:2. Yugoslavia scored 0, allowed 2.\n\nAdding up the goals scored across these three matches:\n5 (Row 5) + 2 (Row 6) + 0 (Row 7) = 7 goals total.\n\nGoals allowed:\n0 (Row 5) + 1 (Row 6) + 2 (Row 7) = 3 goals total.\n\nWait, so according to this, the team scored 7 and conceded 3 across three matches. But the claim mentions \"the 2 1982 world cup qualify score\", which suggests two matches. That's confusing because the table shows three matches of that type.\n\nSo maybe I misinterpreted the claim. Let me re-examine it: \"score 7 goal and allow 3 against in the 2 1982 world cup qualify score.\" It could mean that across two qualifying games, they scored 7 and allowed 3. But according to the table, there are three such matches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider only two of them? Let me check again:\n\nRow 5: 5:0 (Yugoslavia 5)\nRow 6: 2:1 (Yugoslavia 2)\nRow 7: 0:2 (Yugoslavia 0)\n\nTotal across all three: 5+2+0 = 7 goals scored, and 0+1+2=3 conceded.\n\nBut the claim mentions \"the 2\" which might refer to two games. However, in reality, there are three matches listed as '1982 wcq'. So if I take all three into account, the numbers add up: 7 goals scored and 3 allowed. But if it's referring to only two of them, then let me see:\n\nIf we consider just Row 5 and Row 6:\nScored: 5 + 2 = 7\nAllowed: 0 +1 =1\n\nBut that doesn't add up to 3 allowed.\n\nAlternatively, Rows 6 and 7:\nScored: 2+0=2\nAllowed:1+2=3\n\nThat gives 2 scored and 3 allowed, but not 7 scored.\n\nAnother possibility is the claim counts goals in two matches, but perhaps it's a mistake. The user might have intended to refer to all their qualifying games, which are three, but mistakenly said \"the 2\".\n\nGiven that, the total across three matches does add up to 7 scored and 3 allowed. However, since the claim mentions \"the 2\", maybe they meant two games where these totals occurred.\n\nBut in reality, it's three games. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because it refers to two games but there are actually three, making the statement misleading.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The user might have made a typo, and it should be \"the 3\" instead of \"the 2\". But sticking strictly to the given data, let's proceed.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps in the qualifiers, Yugoslavia played two matches where they scored 7 goals total and allowed 3? Let me check again:\n\nIf we take all three games as part of the qualifiers, then yes, 7-3. So maybe the claim is referring to their overall performance in all qualifiers (three games) but mistakenly said \"2\" instead of \"3\". Or perhaps the user intended to refer to two specific matches where these totals occurred.\n\nBut in any case, based on the table, across all '1982 wcq' games, they scored 7 and allowed 3. So the numerical claim is correct, but the number of games (2 vs 3) might be an issue.\n\nHowever, the claim says \"the yugoslavian national team score 7 goal and allow 3 against in the 2 1982 world cup qualify score.\" The phrasing is a bit off. It could mean that across two matches, they scored 7 and allowed 3. But according to the table, it's three matches.\n\nSo if we go strictly by the number of games mentioned (two), but in reality, there are three, then the claim would be false because it's not referring to two matches but three. Or perhaps it's a typo, and they meant three, making the claim true.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is correct because across all their qualifiers, which were three games, they scored 7 and allowed 3. So regardless of the number mentioned (2 vs 3), the totals are accurate.\n\nWait, but the claim specifically mentions \"the 2 1982 world cup qualify score\", so two matches. But in reality, there are three such matches. Therefore, perhaps the claim is incorrect because it refers to two games but there were three.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me list all '1982 wcq' rows:\n\nRow 5: vs Luxembourg\nRow 6: vs Denmark\nRow 7: vs Italy\n\nThat's three matches. So the claim says \"the 2\", implying two matches, but there are three. Therefore, the claim is inaccurate in that aspect.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the user meant \"two\" as in two legs of a home and away tie? But no, these seem to be separate matches against different opponents.\n\nSo given that, the claim's mention of \"the 2\" might make it incorrect because they played three qualifying games. However, their total across all three is indeed 7-3. So if we ignore the number of games mentioned, the numerical totals are correct, but the reference to two games is wrong.\n\nBut since the user specifically included \"the 2\", perhaps that's a key part of the claim. Therefore, considering both aspects: they scored 7 and allowed 3 across three games, not two. So the claim is incorrect because it mentions two games but in reality, it's three.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the number, and it should be \"three\". But since we have to evaluate based on what's given, which says \"the 2\", perhaps the claim is false.\n\nBut I'm not sure. The main issue is whether the scores add up across two or three games. If it's across all their qualifiers (three), then 7-3 is correct. So maybe the user mistakenly said \"two\" when they meant to refer to all matches, making the numerical part accurate but the count incorrect.\n\nIn any case, perhaps the focus is on whether the scores add up to 7 and 3, regardless of the number of games mentioned. If so, then the claim is correct numerically, even if the game count is off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that in their qualifying campaign, they had two matches where these totals occurred, but according to the table, it's three.\n\nGiven this ambiguity, perhaps the answer should note that while the numerical totals are accurate across all qualifiers (three games), the mention of \"two\" might be incorrect. But since the user asked for whether the claim is correct based on the data, focusing on the numbers: they scored 7 and allowed 3 in their qualifying games.\n\nSo, to sum up, despite the confusion about the number of games, the total goals match. Therefore, the claim is true numerically but possibly incorrect in stating \"the 2\" instead of \"three\". However, if we focus solely on the numbers, it's accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Yugoslavia scored 7 goals and allowed 3 across their 1982 World Cup qualifiers is correct when considering all three matches. The mention of \"two\" instead of \"three\" might be a mistake, but numerically, the totals are accurate.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is true based on the data provided, as Yugoslavia scored a total of 7 goals and conceded 3 in their qualifying games for the 1982 World Cup.",
