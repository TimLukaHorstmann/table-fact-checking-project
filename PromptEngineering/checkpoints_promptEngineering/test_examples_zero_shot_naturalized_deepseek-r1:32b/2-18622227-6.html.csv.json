    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the australian open and the french open have the same result in 1996 and 1990\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the table structure. The table has five rows:\n\n- Row 1: List of tournaments, all labeled as 'grand slam tournaments' for each year from 1986 to 1999.\n- Rows 2-5 correspond to specific tournaments: Australian Open (Row 2), French Open (Row 3), Wimbledon (Row 4), and US Open (Row 5). Each of these rows has results for the years mentioned.\n\nThe claim compares two tournaments: Australian Open and French Open. We need to check their results in two specific years, 1990 and 1996.\n\nStarting with 1990:\n\n- For Australian Open (Row 2), the result in 1990 is '3r'.\n- For French Open (Row 3), the result in 1990 is '3r'.\n\nSo, both have the same result ('3r') in 1990.\n\nNext, checking 1996:\n\n- Australian Open (Row 2) in 1996 shows 'a'.\n- French Open (Row 3) in 1996 also shows 'qf'.\n\nWait, that's a discrepancy. The claim says both have the same result in 1996, but according to the table, Australian Open has 'a' while French Open has 'qf'. These are different results.\n\nTherefore, even though they match in 1990, since they don't match in 1996, the claim is not fully supported. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nI need to identify the relevant cells for both years and tournaments:\n\n- For Australian Open (Row 2) in 1990: {\"row_2\", \"1990\"}\n- French Open (Row 3) in 1990: {\"row_3\", \"1990\"}\n- Australian Open (Row 2) in 1996: {\"row_2\", \"1996\"}\n- French Open (Row 3) in 1996: {\"row_3\", \"1996\"}\n\nThese are the cells that were checked to evaluate the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1990\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"1990\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1996\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"1996\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"each tournament have the same result in the year 1990 and 1999\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the table. The table has five rows: Row 1 lists the tournaments (Grand Slam tournaments), and Rows 2 to 5 correspond to each specific tournament\u2014Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open respectively. Each row has columns for the years from 1986 to 1999.\n\nThe claim is about whether each tournament had the same result in both 1990 and 1999. So, I need to check for each tournament, what their results were in those two specific years (1990 and 1999) and see if they are identical across all tournaments.\n\nLet's go through each tournament one by one.\n\nStarting with the Australian Open (Row 2):\n- In 1990, under the column '1990', the result is '3r'.\n- In 1999, under '1999', it's '1r'.\n\nSo for the Australian Open, the results in 1990 and 1999 are different.\n\nNext, the French Open (Row 3):\n- In 1990: Looking at Row 3, column '1990' is '3r'.\n- In 1999: Column '1999' shows '1r'.\n\nAgain, these results differ between 1990 and 1999.\n\nMoving on to Wimbledon (Row 4):\n- For 1990, the result is '3r'.\n- In 1999, it's '1r'.\n\nDifferent results again.\n\nLastly, the US Open (Row 5):\n- In 1990: The result is '3r'.\n- In 1999: It shows '1r'.\n\nAgain, different from each other.\n\nWait a minute. So for each tournament individually, their results in 1990 and 1999 are the same only if both years show the same stage reached. Let me verify again:\n\nAustralian Open:\n- 1990: 3r\n- 1999: 1r \u2192 Different.\n\nFrench Open:\n- 1990: 3r\n- 1999: 1r \u2192 Different.\n\nWimbledon:\n- 1990: 3r\n- 1999: 1r \u2192 Different.\n\nUS Open:\n- 1990: 3r\n- 1999: 1r \u2192 Different.\n\nWait, this is confusing. The claim says each tournament has the same result in both years, meaning for each tournament individually, their 1990 and 1999 results are identical? Or does it mean that all tournaments have the same result across those two years?\n\nI think the wording suggests that for each individual tournament, their performance in 1990 is the same as in 1999. So, let's check each tournament's 1990 and 1999 results.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me look again.\n\nLooking at Row 2 (Australian Open):\n- 1990: '3r'\n- 1999: '1r' \u2192 Different.\n\nRow 3 (French Open):\n- 1990: '3r'\n- 1999: '1r' \u2192 Different.\n\nRow 4 (Wimbledon):\n- 1990: '3r'\n- 1999: '1r' \u2192 Different.\n\nRow 5 (US Open):\n- 1990: '3r'\n- 1999: '1r' \u2192 Different.\n\nSo, for each tournament, their results in 1990 and 1999 are different. Therefore, the claim that \"each tournament have the same result in the year 1990 and 1999\" is false because none of them have matching results across those two years.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The table's columns are for each year, so for each row (tournament), the '1990' column shows their result in 1990 and '1999' shows their result in 1999. So, to check if \"each tournament has the same result in both years,\" I need to see if for each tournament, the cell under 1990 is equal to the cell under 1999.\n\nLooking at Row 2 (Australian Open): '3r' vs '1r' \u2192 Not same.\nRow 3: '3r' vs '1r' \u2192 Different.\nRow 4: '3r' vs '1r' \u2192 Different.\nRow 5: '3r' vs '1r' \u2192 Different.\n\nTherefore, for every tournament, the results in 1990 and 1999 are different. So, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait again. Let me check Row 2 (Australian Open) 1990 is '3r', but looking at the column headers: Are the years correctly aligned? For example, in Row 2, columns go from 1986 to 1999. So, 1990 is indeed the fifth column and 1999 is the last one.\n\nYes, so I think my initial assessment was correct. All four tournaments have different results in 1990 and 1999.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that each tournament had the same result in both 1990 and 1999 is false because for every tournament, their performance in these two years differed.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nFalse. Each tournament did not have the same result in 1990 and 1999; all four tournaments (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open) showed different results between those years.\n\nThe relevant data points are:\n\n- **Australian Open**: 1990 - 3r, 1999 - 1r\n- **French Open**: 1990 - 3r, 1999 - 1r\n- **Wimbledon**: 1990 - 3r, 1999 - 1r\n- **US Open**: 1990 - 3r, 1999 - 1r\n\nEach tournament's result in 1990 was different from their result in 1999.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"Wimbledon have only 1 'a' result during the year 1986 to 1999\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll understand what the table represents. It seems to be a record of tournament results for four major tennis tournaments: Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open, spanning from 1986 to 1999. Each row corresponds to a specific tournament, with columns representing the years. The entries under each year are abbreviations like 'a', '3r', 'qf', etc., which I assume stand for different stages or outcomes in the tournaments (e.g., 'a' might mean absent or not played, '1r' could be first round, '2r' second round, '3r' third round, 'qf' quarterfinals, and 'sf' semifinals).\n\nThe claim is about Wimbledon's results. Specifically, it states that Wimbledon had only one 'a' result between 1986 and 1999. So my task is to check all the entries under the Wimbledon row (Row 4) for each year from 1986 to 1999 and count how many times 'a' appears.\n\nLooking at Row 4, which corresponds to Wimbledon:\n- The years are listed as columns: 1986, 1988, 1989, up to 1999.\nWait a minute, I notice that the column headers don't include every year from 1986 to 1999. For example, there's no data for 1987 in this table. The given years are: 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999. So, the table skips 1987.\n\nNow, I'll go through each year under Wimbledon (Row 4) and note where 'a' appears:\n\n- 1986: a\n- 1988: sf\n- 1989: qf\n- 1990: 3r\n- 1991: qf\n- 1992: 3r\n- 1993: 1r\n- 1994: 2r\n- 1995: 3r\n- 1996: qf\n- 1997: 3r\n- 1998: 3r\n- 1999: 1r\n\nFrom this, I see that 'a' appears only once in 1986 under Wimbledon. The other years have different results without any additional 'a's.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"during the year 1986 to 1999.\" Does that include all years in between? But in our table, we don't have data for every single year; some are missing, like 1987. However, since the table only provides specific years, I can only assess based on the given data.\n\nSo according to the provided table, Wimbledon has exactly one 'a' result in 1986 and none in other listed years. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because there's only one occurrence of 'a'.\n\nThe relevant cells are each year under Wimbledon (Row 4), but since we're specifically looking for 'a', I need to list all these columns as they were checked.\n\nWait no, perhaps I should only include the cells where 'a' was found. So only 1986 in Row 4 has 'a'. Therefore, the relevant cell is just {\"row_index\":3 (since Row 4 is index 3), \"column_name\":\"1986\"}.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The problem says to include all cells that are relevant to verify the claim. Since I had to check each year under Wimbledon from 1986 onwards as per the table to ensure there's only one 'a', perhaps all these cells are relevant because I looked at each of them to confirm that only 1986 has 'a'. So, including all years from 1986 to 1999 under Wimbledon (Row 4) would be necessary.\n\nWait, the table doesn't include every year; for example, 1987 is missing. But the claim covers 1986-1999, so perhaps in reality, there could be more 'a's if those years were included. However, based on the given data, I can only confirm that within the provided years, Wimbledon has only one 'a'.\n\nTherefore, to accurately assess using the table, we look at all available entries under Wimbledon and count 'a's. Only 1986 in Row 4 has an 'a', so the claim is correct based on the data.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are each of the years (columns) under Wimbledon (Row 4), from 1986 to 1999 as listed in the table.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if Wimbledon had only one 'a' result between 1986 and 1999 based on the provided data, we examine each year under Wimbledon:\n\n- **1986**: a\n- **1988**: sf\n- **1989**: qf\n- **1990**: 3r\n- **1991**: qf\n- **1992**: 3r\n- **1993**: 1r\n- **1994**: 2r\n- **1995**: 3r\n- **1996**: qf\n- **1997**: 3r\n- **1998**: 3r\n- **1999**: 1r\n\nOnly the year 1986 under Wimbledon shows an 'a'. Therefore, the claim is correct with only one occurrence of 'a'.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n```json\n[\n    {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"1986\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"1988\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"1989\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"1990\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"1991\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"1992\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"1993\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"1994\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"1995\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"1996\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"1997\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"1998\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"1999\"}\n]\n```\n\n**Answer:** The claim is TRUE.

The claim says, \"the australian open have 3 a result and wimbledon have only 1.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's talking about two tournaments: the Australian Open and Wimbledon. The claim mentions the number of 'a' results for each. From the table, it looks like 'a' stands for something, maybe \"absent\" or \"did not participate.\" \n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different tournament. Row 2 is the Australian Open, and Row 4 is Wimbledon. The columns are years from 1986 to 1999. Each cell under these rows has entries like 'a', '3r', 'qf', etc.\n\nSo I need to count how many times 'a' appears in each of these tournaments across all the years listed.\n\nStarting with the Australian Open (Row 2). Let's go through each year:\n\n- 1986: a\n- 1988: 3r\n- 1989: 3r\n- 1990: 3r\n- 1991: a\n- 1992: qf\n- 1993: 3r\n- 1994: 2r\n- 1995: 1r\n- 1996: a\n- 1997: 2r\n- 1998: 1r\n- 1999: 1r\n\nCounting the 'a's here: 1986, 1991, and 1996.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. The first row lists the types of tournaments: grand slam tournaments from 1986 to 1999. Then each subsequent row corresponds to a specific tournament with their respective results over those years. \n\nThe claim mentions two points about the US Open:\n1. In 1986, they had \"1r\".\n2. In 1999, they had \"3r\".\n\nI need to check both these facts against the table.\n\nLooking at Row 5 of the table, which is for the US Open:\n\n- The column names are years from 1986 to 1999.\n- Under 1986 (column name '1986'), the value is '1r'.\n- Under 1999 (column name '1999'), the value is '1r'.\n\nWait a minute, according to this, in 1999, it's '1r', not '3r' as the claim states. So there seems to be a discrepancy here.\n\nBut let me double-check in case I misread something. \n\n- For 1986: Yes, it's clearly '1r'.\n- For 1999: It's definitely '1r'.\n\nHmm, so the first part of the claim is correct (1986: 1r), but the second part isn't (1999 should be 1r, not 3r). Therefore, the entire claim isn't fully supported by the table.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again. \n\nLooking back at Row 5:\n\n- The US Open's results:\n  - 1986: '1r'\n  - 1987: not listed here, but irrelevant\n  ...\n  - 1999: '1r'\n\nSo yes, in 1999, the US Open had a result of '1r', which contradicts the claim's assertion of '3r'. \n\nThus, since one part of the claim is incorrect, the overall claim must be FALSE. However, I should consider if there's any possibility that I misread the table or columns.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps I mixed up the rows? Let me confirm:\n\nRow 1: Tournament types (not relevant for specific results).\nRow 2: Australian Open\nRow 3: French Open\nRow 4: Wimbledon\nRow 5: US Open\n\nYes, Row 5 is indeed the US Open. So the relevant cells are:\n- Row 5, column '1986' which is '1r'.\n- Row 5, column '1999' which is '1r'.\n\nSo both parts of the claim should be correct if the table supports it. But in reality, the second part isn't correct because 1999 shows '1r', not '3r'. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, but wait again! Let me check all rows once more to make sure I didn't pick the wrong one by mistake.\n\nRow 2: Australian Open\n- 1986: a\n- 1999: 1r\n\nRow 3: French Open\n- 1986: a\n- 1999: 1r\n\nRow 4: Wimbledon\n- 1986: a\n- 1999: 1r\n\nYes, so all other tournaments also have '1r' in 1999 except maybe others. So it's consistent that US Open is the same.\n\nTherefore, I can confirm that the claim is FALSE because while 1986 is correct ('1r'), 1999 is incorrect; instead of '3r', it's '1r'.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states two facts about the US Open: a result of \"1r\" in 1986 and \"3r\" in 1999. Checking the table, the US Open indeed had \"1r\" in 1986 but \"1r\" in 1999, not \"3r\". Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"1986\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"1999\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the wimbledon have the same result in the year 1986 and 1999\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has rows for each tournament: grand slam tournaments, Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open. Each row lists results from 1986 to 1999.\n\nThe claim is about Wimbledon's results in 1986 and 1999. So I need to check the cells under Wimbledon for these years.\n\nLooking at Row 4, which corresponds to Wimbledon. The column names are the years: 1986, 1987... up to 1999. \n\nFor 1986 (column '1986'), the result is 'a'. Wait, what does 'a' stand for? Maybe it's an abbreviation like 'absent' or 'did not participate'? I'm not sure, but I'll note that.\n\nThen for 1999 (column '1999'), the result is '1r', which I think stands for 'first round'. \n\nSo in 1986, Wimbledon's result was 'a' and in 1999 it was '1r'. Since these are different results ('a' vs. '1r'), the claim that they are the same would be FALSE.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check. Let me look again:\n\n- Row 4: Tournament is Wimbledon.\n- Column 1986: a\n- Column 1999: 1r\n\nYes, they are different. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to list the row indices and column names. \n\nRow 4 corresponds to Wimbledon. The columns are '1986' and '1999'. So the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row index 3 (since rows start at 0: Row 1 is index 0, Row 2 index 1, ..., Row 5 is index 4). Wait no, in the initial table, Row 1 is grand slam, which is probably row 0 if it's zero-indexed. Let me count:\n\nRows:\n1: grand slam (index 0)\n2: australian open (index 1)\n3: french open (index 2)\n4: wimbledon (index 3)\n5: us open (index 4)\n\nSo Wimbledon is row index 3.\n\nColumns are '1986' and '1999'. So the relevant cells are:\n\n{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"1986\"}\n{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"1999\"}\n\nThus, the JSON should reflect this.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"1986\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"1999\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the us open have the different result in the year 1990 and 1999\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided. It seems that each row represents a different tournament: grand slam tournaments, Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open. The columns are years from 1986 to 1999, with entries indicating the results in those years.\n\nThe claim is about the US Open having different results in 1990 and 1999. So I need to check the US Open row for both these years and see if their results are indeed different.\n\nLooking at Row 5, which is labeled \"tournament: us open\". The columns are years, so for 1990, I look at column '1990' in that row. According to the table, the result was '3r'. Then, for 1999, checking column '1999', it shows '1r'.\n\nNow, comparing these two: '3r' vs. '1r'. Since they are not the same, the results are different in those years. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI also need to identify the relevant cells that were checked. For the US Open, I looked at row 5 (index starts at 0, so it's actually index 4 since Row 1 is index 0) for columns '1990' and '1999'.\n\nWait a second, I just realized that in programming, arrays are zero-indexed. So the first row is index 0, which is \"tournament: grand slam tournaments\". Therefore, Row 5 (US Open) would be at index 4. Hmm, let me double-check.\n\nYes, looking back:\nRow 1: Grand Slam\nRow 2: Australian Open\nRow 3: French Open\nRow 4: Wimbledon\nRow 5: US Open\n\nSo the row indices are 0 to 4 for these five rows. Therefore, the US Open is at row index 4.\n\nThe columns in question are '1990' and '1999'. So each relevant cell would be {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1990\"} and another with column_name \"1999\".\n\nSo putting it all together, the claim is TRUE because the results for US Open in 1990 (3r) and 1999 (1r) are different.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the US Open row (row index 4) for both 1990 and 1999, which show different results. Therefore, the answer is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1990\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1999\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the australian open have same 'a' result as wimbledon have\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break down how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It seems there are five rows: one for each tournament (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open) and a header row that lists the years from 1986 to 1999 as columns. Each cell under these years likely represents the performance or result in that particular year.\n\nThe claim is about comparing the 'a' results between Australian Open and Wimbledon across all the years listed. So, I need to check each year for both tournaments and see if their results are the same when it's marked as 'a'.\n\nLooking at Row 2 (Australian Open):\n- The cells under each year show various results like 'a', '3r', 'qf', etc. Specifically, for Australian Open, in some years they have 'a' which I assume stands for 'absent' or 'did not participate'.\n\nSimilarly, looking at Row 4 (Wimbledon), their results are also listed under each year.\n\nMy task is to compare each corresponding cell between Australian Open and Wimbledon. For every year where Australian Open has an 'a', I need to check if Wimbledon also has an 'a' in the same year.\n\nLet me go through each year one by one:\n\n1986: \n- Australian Open (Row 2): a\n- Wimbledon (Row 4): a\nBoth have 'a'. So, this is matching.\n\n1988:\n- Australian Open: 3r\n- Wimbledon: sf\nNot both 'a', so this doesn't matter for the claim. The claim only concerns when they have the same 'a' result.\n\nWait, actually, the claim says \"have same 'a' result as\", which I think means in all years where one has 'a', the other should also have 'a'. So if Australian Open has 'a' in a year, Wimbledon must have 'a' in that same year for it to be true. Conversely, if Wimbledon has 'a', then Australian Open should too. But let's focus on when either of them has 'a' and see if they both do.\n\nWait no, the claim is specifically about the 'a' results. So I think the claim is saying that whenever one tournament has an 'a' result, the other does as well in the same year.\n\nSo, looking back:\n\n1986: Both have 'a'.\n1987 isn't listed; probably not applicable.\n1988:\n- Australian Open: 3r\n- Wimbledon: sf\nNeither is 'a', so no issue here.\n\n1989:\n- Australian Open: 3r\n- Wimbledon: qf\nNeither is 'a'.\n\n1990:\n- Australian Open: 3r\n- Wimbledon: 3r\nNo 'a's.\n\n1991:\n- Australian Open: a\n- Wimbledon: qf\nHere, Australian Open has 'a' but Wimbledon does not. This breaks the claim because they don't have the same result in this year.\n\nWait, so if in any year where one has 'a', the other doesn't, then the claim is false. So since in 1991, Australian Open has 'a' and Wimbledon doesn't, that means their results are not the same for all years when either has 'a'.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nTo confirm, let's check the rest of the years just to be thorough:\n\n1992:\n- Australian Open: qf\n- Wimbledon: 3r\nNeither is 'a'.\n\n1993:\n- Australian Open: 3r\n- Wimbledon: 1r\nNo 'a's.\n\n1994:\n- Australian Open: 2r\n- Wimbledon: 2r\nNo 'a's.\n\n1995:\n- Australian Open: 1r\n- Wimbledon: 3r\nNeither has 'a'.\n\n1996:\n- Australian Open: a\n- Wimbledon: qf\nAgain, Australian Open has 'a' but Wimbledon doesn't. So another discrepancy.\n\nWait, so in both 1991 and 1996, Australian Open has 'a', but Wimbledon does not. That definitely means the claim is false because their 'a' results don't match across all years.\n\nSo the relevant cells are where either tournament has an 'a'. Therefore, I need to list those specific cells in the JSON response.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there are years where Australian Open has 'a' but Wimbledon does not. The relevant cells include the years 1986, 1991, and 1996 for both tournaments.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1986\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1986\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1991\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1991\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1996\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1996\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
