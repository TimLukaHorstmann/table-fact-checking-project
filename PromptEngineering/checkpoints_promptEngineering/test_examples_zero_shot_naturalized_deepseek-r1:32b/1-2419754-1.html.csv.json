    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 2 institution locate within the state of ohio that be member of the great midwest conference\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim carefully. It's saying there are two institutions located in Ohio that were members of the Great Midwest Conference (GMC). The table lists six institutions with details including their location and when they joined/left the GMC.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. **University of Cincinnati**: Located in Cincinnati, OH. Joined 1991, left 1995.\n2. **University of Dayton**: Located in Dayton, OH. Joined 1993, left 1995.\n3. **DePaul University**: Chicago, IL. So not in Ohio.\n4. **Marquette University**: Milwaukee, WI. Not in Ohio.\n5. **University of Memphis**: Memphis, TN. Not in Ohio.\n6. **Saint Louis University**: St. Louis, MO. Not in Ohio.\n\nSo, only the first two rows (Row 1 and Row 2) are institutions in Ohio that were part of the GMC. They both joined around early '90s and left by 1995. This matches the claim exactly\u2014two Ohio institutions were members of the conference.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"5 out of the 6 institutions that be in the great midwest conference join the conference in 1991.\" \n\nFirst, let's parse the table. There are six rows, each representing an institution with various details including when they joined and left a conference.\n\nThe relevant columns here are 'joined' which tells us the year they joined the conference. The claim is about how many institutions joined in 1991. So I'll check each row's 'joined' column.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Joined 1991.\nRow 2: Joined 1993.\nRow 3: Joined 1991.\nRow 4: Joined 1991.\nRow 5: Joined 1991.\nRow 6: Joined 1991.\n\nSo, rows 1,3,4,5,6 joined in 1991. That's five institutions. The sixth one (Row 2) joined in 1993. \n\nTherefore, the claim that 5 out of 6 institutions joined in 1991 is correct. So the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, to list the relevant cells. Each row has a 'joined' column which we checked.

The claim is: \"there be 2 public institution that be member of the great midwest conference.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what's being asked here. The user wants to know if exactly two public institutions are members of the Great Midwest Conference (GMC). So I need to check each row in the table to see which ones have \"public\" as their type and also see when they joined and left the conference.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows, each representing a different institution. Each has columns for institution name, nickname, location, founded year, type (public or private), enrollment, joined year, and left year.\n\nThe key pieces of information I need from each row are:\n1. Type: to confirm if it's public.\n2. Joined and Left years: to see their membership in the GMC.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: University of Cincinnati\n- Type: Public\n- Joined: 1991, Left: 1995\nSo this institution is public and was a member from 1991 to 1995. That counts as one.\n\nRow 2: University of Dayton\n- Type: Private\nSo even though they joined in 1993 and left in 1995, since it's private, it doesn't count towards the claim about public institutions.\n\nRow 3: DePaul University\n- Type: Private\nAgain, private, so not relevant for this claim.\n\nRow 4: Marquette University\n- Type: Private\nSame as above.\n\nRow 5: University of Memphis\n- Type: Public\nJoined in 1991 and left in 1995. This is the second public institution that was a member.\n\nRow 6: Saint Louis University\n- Type: Private\nSo, private, not relevant.\n\nNow, compiling this information:\n- University of Cincinnati (public) joined in 1991.\n- University of Memphis (public) also joined in 1991.\n\nBoth left in 1995. So there are exactly two public institutions that were members of the Great Midwest Conference according to the table. \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because both these universities fit the criteria of being public and having been part of the conference during those years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"left\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"left\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"3 of the member of the great midwest conference be found before 1860\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim means. The claim states that three members of the Great Midwest Conference were founded before 1860. I need to check the 'founded' year for each institution in the table and count how many were established prior to 1860.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows, each representing an institution. Each row has a 'founded' column which indicates the year the institution was established. My task is to examine these years and see if at least three of them fall before 1860.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 1**: University of Cincinnati was founded in 1819. Since 1819 is less than 1860, this counts.\n2. **Row 2**: University of Dayton was founded in 1850. Again, this is before 1860.\n3. **Row 3**: DePaul University was founded in 1898. That's after 1860, so it doesn't count.\n4. **Row 4**: Marquette University was founded in 1881. Also after 1860, so not counted.\n5. **Row 5**: University of Memphis was founded in 1912. Definitely after 1860.\n6. **Row 6**: Saint Louis University was founded in 1818. This is before 1860.\n\nSo, the institutions founded before 1860 are:\n\n- Row 1 (1819)\n- Row 2 (1850)\n- Row 6 (1818)\n\nThat's three institutions. The claim states that \"3 of the members\" were found before 1860, which is exactly what we have here.\n\nNow, looking at the table structure, I need to note the relevant cells for each of these findings. For each row where the 'founded' year is before 1860, I should list the row index and the column name 'founded'.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 1, column 'founded'\n- Row 2, column 'founded'\n- Row 6, column 'founded'\n\nSince three institutions meet the criteria, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n   ]\n}",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should locate both universities in the table. Looking at Row 1, it's about the University of Cincinnati with an enrollment of 41357 students. Then, looking for Saint Louis University, that's in Row 6 with an enrollment of 13785 students.\n\nThe claim states that Cincinnati has 27,572 more students than Saint Louis. To verify this, I need to subtract the enrollment numbers. So, 41357 (Cincinnati) minus 13785 (Saint Louis) equals... Let me calculate that: 41357 - 13785 = 27572.\n\nWait a minute, that's exactly the number mentioned in the claim. So, it looks like the calculation is correct. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because the difference in enrollment between the two universities matches what's stated.\n</think>\n\nThe University of Cincinnati has an enrollment of 41,357 students, while Saint Louis University has 13,785 students.

Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 1: University of Cincinnati, located in Cincinnati, Ohio.\n- Row 2: University of Dayton, located in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nRows 3 to 6 are from Illinois, Wisconsin, Tennessee, and Missouri respectively, so they don't belong to Ohio. So there are two institutions in Ohio: University of Cincinnati and University of Dayton.\n\nNext, I need to check if both these institutions were members of the Great Midwest Conference (GMC).

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that more than half of the members (institutions) of the Great Midwest Conference were founded before 1860. So, I need to check how many institutions in the table were established before 1860 and see if that number exceeds half of the total.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows, each representing a different institution with details like institution name, nickname, location, founding year, etc. The key columns here are \"institution\" and \"founded.\" So, for each row, I'll check the \"founded\" year to see if it's before 1860.\n\nLet me list out each institution and their founded years:\n\n1. University of Cincinnati - Founded: 1819\n2. University of Dayton - Founded: 1850\n3. DePaul University - Founded: 1898\n4. Marquette University - Founded: 1881\n5. University of Memphis - Founded: 1912\n6. Saint Louis University - Founded: 1818\n\nNow, I'll note which were founded before 1860:\n\n- Cincinnati (1819) \u2192 Yes\n- Dayton (1850) \u2192 Yes\n- DePaul (1898) \u2192 No\n- Marquette (1881) \u2192 No\n- Memphis (1912) \u2192 No\n- Saint Louis (1818) \u2192 Yes\n\nSo, the institutions founded before 1860 are Cincinnati, Dayton, and Saint Louis. That's three out of six.\n\nNow, calculating half of six is three. The claim says \"more than half,\" which would require more than three institutions.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the university of cincinnati have the same number of student enrol as saint louis university\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the institutions mentioned in the claim: University of Cincinnati and Saint Louis University. I need to check their enrollment numbers from the table.\n\nLooking at Row 1 for University of Cincinnati, the enrollment is listed as 41357 students. Now, Saint Louis University is in Row 6, and its enrollment number is 13785 students.\n\nComparing these two, 41357 is clearly not equal to 13785. So, the claim that they have the same enrollment numbers isn't true.\n\nTo make sure I didn't miss anything, I'll double-check each relevant cell:\n- University of Cincinnati's enrollment in Row 1.\n- Saint Louis University's enrollment in Row 6.\n\nBoth are correct as per the table. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE because their enrollments aren't the same.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_5\", \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
