    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"episode 4 be the earliest episode number that originally air on june 8, 2008\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. It's saying that episode 4 was the earliest episode that aired on June 8, 2008. To verify this, I need to check two things: whether episode 4 actually aired on June 8, and if there are any episodes with lower numbers (earlier in sequence) that also aired on that date.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row corresponds to an episode with its details including the airdate. The rows are listed from episode 1 to episode 15, so I can go through them one by one or perhaps just look for June 8, 2008 specifically.\n\nI'll start by scanning the \"original airdate\" column across all rows to find any that match June 8, 2008. Let's see:\n\nRow 1: May 18, 2008\nRow 2: May 25, 2008\nRow 3: June 1, 2008\nRow 4: June 8, 2008 \u2013 Oh, here it is! Episode 4 aired on June 8.\nRow 5: June 15, 2008\n...\nContinuing down the list, the rest of the episodes after row 4 have different air dates.\n\nSo episode 4 is indeed the one that aired on June 8. Now, I need to check if it's the earliest episode number (i.e., has the lowest number) with that airdate. Since each episode in the table increases by one in order, and all earlier episodes (1-3) have different air dates, there are no episodes before episode 4 that aired on June 8.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because episode 4 is the earliest episode that originally aired on June 8, 2008.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE. Episode 4 was the first to air on June 8, 2008, and no earlier episodes shared this date.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"the least watched episode number with an original airdate of 8 june 2008 be 4.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse what this means. It says that the least watched episode (which would have the lowest viewership) that aired on June 8th, 2008 is episode number 4.\n\nI'll start by looking through each row in the table to find the one with the original airdate of June 8, 2008. Let me go through the rows:\n\nRow 1: May 18, 2008 \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 2: May 25, 2008 \u2013 nope.\nRow 3: June 1, 2008 \u2013 still not.\nRow 4: June 8, 2008. Okay, that's the row we're interested in.\n\nLooking at Row 4, the episode number is 4, viewers are 1.364 million, and the nightly rank is 4. The claim states that this should be the least watched episode with that airdate, which would mean it has the lowest viewer count among episodes airing on June 8, 2008.\n\nWait a minute \u2013 but in this table, each original airdate seems to correspond to only one episode. So for June 8, there's only Episode 4 listed. Therefore, if that's the only episode on that date, it is both the least and most watched since there are no others to compare it with.\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any other episodes with the same airdate. Looking through all rows again, I don't see another entry for June 8, 2008. So Episode 4 is the only one on that date, making it automatically the least watched because there's nothing else to compare.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true because there are no other episodes on that airdate to have a lower viewer count. The viewership of 1.364 million is indeed the lowest (and only) for that specific date.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Episode 4, aired on June 8, 2008, is the least watched. Since it's the sole episode on that date, it meets the condition.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
