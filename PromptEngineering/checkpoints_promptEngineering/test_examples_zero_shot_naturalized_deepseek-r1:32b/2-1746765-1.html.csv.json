It states that an individual (referred to as \"he\") has worked with two specific Formula One teams: Force India F1 Team and Sahara Force India F1 Team. My task is to verify if both these teams are present in the table under the \"team\" column for the same person or driver.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through each row to find entries related to Formula One.

So, I need to check if there are any entries in the table for DTM between those years and see who the driver is.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a season and series for Paul's participation.
