    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"montreal be the visitor on march 6\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim has two parts: \n1. The team involved is Montreal.\n2. They were the visitors on March 6.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll need to find a row where the date is March 6 and check who was the visitor that day.\n\nFirst, let me go through each row in the table to see which one corresponds to March 6. \n\n- Row 1: March 1\n- Row 2: March 2\n- Row 3: March 4\n- Row 4: March 6 \u2192 This is the date we're looking for.\n\nNow, checking Row 4:\n\nRow 4 has:\n- Date: March 6\n- Visitor: Montreal\n\nThe claim states that Montreal was the visitor on March 6. From Row 4, the 'visitor' column indeed says Montreal. So this part of the claim is correct.\n\nIs there anything else I need to check? The claim doesn't mention other details like the home team or the score, so focusing solely on the date and visitor is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, since the table confirms that Montreal was the visiting team on March 6, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"before march 6 montreal be the visitor\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break down what this claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions two things: the date and the status of Montreal as a visitor before March 6. So, I'm looking for any row where the date is earlier than March 6 and Montreal is listed as the visitor.\n\nLooking at each row in order:\n\nRow 1: March 1 - Visitor is Philadelphia, not Montreal.\nRow 2: March 2 - Visitor is NY Rangers.\nRow 3: March 4 - Visitor is Philadelphia again.\nRow 4: March 6 - Visitor is Montreal. Wait, but the claim says \"before\" March 6, so this row doesn't count because it's on March 6.\n\nSo up to Row 4 (March 6), there are no rows where Montreal is the visitor before that date. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Montreal visited on March 6, which is not before March 6 as per the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
