    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"the 2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier be play in leo palace resort soccer field, yona.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It states that a specific competition (2013 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier) was played at a particular venue (Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field, Yona). So, I need to check if there's any row in the table where both these pieces of information match.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Rows 8 and 9 mention Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field, Yona but their competitions are for 2008 and 2010 East Asian Football Championship qualifiers. Not relevant.\n- Row 10: Same venue but competition is 2010 EAFF qualifier. Still not the one mentioned in the claim.\n- Rows 14, 15, 16 all have Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field, Yona as the venue and their competitions are 2012 EAFF East Asian Cup qualifiers and 2013 EAFF qualifiers. Let's look at row 15: date is 20 July 2012, competition is 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup qualifier. The venue matches. So this supports the claim.\n\nTherefore, since there exists a row (row 15) where both the competition and the venue match the claim, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by row 15 which lists the correct venue for the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup qualifier.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the 2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier be play in rizai memorial stadium , manila\". \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into key components:\n\n1. **Competition**: 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier\n2. **Venue**: Rizai Memorial Stadium, Manila\n\nI'll go through each row of the table to check for any matches.\n\nLooking at Row 17: It mentions \"rizal memorial stadium , manila\" as the venue with a competition labeled \"2012 philippine peace cup\". This doesn't match the 2013 EAFF qualifier. So this is close but not exactly what we're looking for.\n\nNow, checking all other rows:\n\n- Rows 1-6: These are from 2006 to 2007 and involve different competitions like AFC Challenge Cup and World Cup qualifiers.\n- Rows 7-11: From 2008 to March 2009. Competitions include AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers and East Asian Football Championship qualifiers, but the venues are in places like Phnom Penh, Yona, etc., not Manila.\n- Rows 12-14: These are from April 2009 to July 2012. The competition here is the AFC Challenge Cup qualifier (Row 12), and others mention EAFF qualifiers but again in Macau Stadium or Leo Palace Resort.\n- Row 15: This row has \"2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier\" as the competition, but the venue is Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field in Yona, not Manila.\n\nSo, in none of the rows do we have a match where the competition is \"2013 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier\" and the venue is Rizal Memorial Stadium in Manila. The closest was Row 17 with Manila but for a different competition, and Row 15 which had the right competition but the wrong venue.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by any row in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup qualifier was played at Rizal Memorial Stadium in Manila. Checking each row:\n\n- **Row 17**: Correct venue (Manila) but competition is \"2012 Philippine Peace Cup\".\n- No other rows mention both the correct competition and venue.\n\nThus, no relevant cells support the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
