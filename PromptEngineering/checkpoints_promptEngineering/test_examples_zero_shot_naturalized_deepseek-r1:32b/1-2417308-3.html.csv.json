So I need to check each state mentioned in the table for their successor names.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five rows. I'll focus on the relevant columns: \"state (class)\" and \"successor\". \n\nRow 3 is Pennsylvania (class 3), and the successor is William Bigler (D). That fits because the first name is William. So that's one part of the claim satisfied.\n\nNext, Row 4 is California (class 3), with the successor being William M Gwin (D). Again, the first name is William. So both states mentioned have successors starting with William.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows for Pennsylvania or California, but looking at the table, each state appears only once in their respective rows. \n\nTherefore, both successors are named William as per the claim. No discrepancies found.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because both California and Pennsylvania have successors named William according to the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"successor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"state (class)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"successor\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the only class 2 state name be new hampshire\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It states that New Hampshire is the only state with a class 2. So I need to check if there are any other states in the table that have a class 2 besides New Hampshire.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: State (class): New Hampshire (2)\nRow 2: Alabama (3)\nRow 3: Pennsylvania (3)\nRow 4: California (3)\nRow 5: Indiana (3)\n\nFrom this, I can see that Row 1 is the only one with a class number of 2. The other rows all have class 3.\n\nNow, let's consider what the claim is asserting. It says \"the only class 2 state name be new hampshire.\" This means that New Hampshire should be the sole entry in the table where the class is 2. Since no other states in the table have a class of 2, this seems to hold true.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if there's any possibility that another row might also have class 2 but isn't explicitly shown. However, all rows clearly list their class numbers as either 2 or 3. So, it's clear that only New Hampshire has a class of 2.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table. The relevant cell to check this is Row 1 under the \"state (class)\" column because it shows New Hampshire with class 2 and no other rows have class 2.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that only New Hampshire has a class 2. Checking each row, only Row 1 lists a class 2 for New Hampshire, while all others are class 3.\n\n**Step-by-step Explanation:**\n1. The claim is about whether New Hampshire is the sole state with class 2.\n2. Reviewing each row in the table:\n   - Row 1: New Hampshire (class 2)\n   - Rows 2-5: Alabama, Pennsylvania, California, Indiana (all class 3)\n3. No other states besides New Hampshire have class 2.\n4.

There's also a claim that William M Gwin and Graham N Fitch joined Congress in 1857. My task is to determine if this claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the table.\n\nFirst, I need to look through each row of the table to find entries for William M Gwin and Graham N Fitch. Let's go step by step.\n\nLooking at Row 4: It mentions California (class 3), with the successor being William M Gwin (D). The date of his formal installation is January 13, 1857. So that's definitely one person in the claim, and he was installed in 1857.\n\nNext, checking Row 5: It's about Indiana (class 3), with Graham N Fitch as the successor, also a Democrat. His formal installation date is February 4, 1857. That means both of them joined Congress in 1857 based on their installation dates.\n\nI should make sure there are no other entries for these two names elsewhere in the table to confirm that I haven't missed any details. Scanning through Rows 1 to 3, none mention Gwin or Fitch, so my focus is correctly on Rows 4 and 5.\n\nTherefore, both William M Gwin and Graham N Fitch were installed as successors in 1857, which supports the claim that they joined Congress that year.

It has five rows, each representing a different state with details about successors in Congress. The columns include state/class, vacator, reason for change, successor, and date of successor's formal installation.\n\nThe claim mentions that there are 5 successors between 1855 and 1857. Let me check the 'date of successors formal installation' column for each row to see if they fall within this timeframe.\n\nRow 1: July 30, 1855 \u2013 This is within the range.\nRow 2: November 26, 1855 \u2013 Also within the range.\nRow 3: January 14, 1856 \u2013 Within range.\nRow 4: January 13, 1857 \u2013 Still within the period.\nRow 5: February 4, 1857 \u2013 Also within.\n\nSo all five rows have dates between 1855 and 1857.

The claim states: \"successor of indiana and alabama be both name william.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this means. It seems like the claim is saying that both Indiana and Alabama have successors named William. So, my goal is to check each state in the table for their respective successors and see if either's successor is named William.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five rows, each representing a different state with various details. Each row has columns: state (class), vacator, reason for change, successor, and date of successor's formal installation.\n\nI'll start by identifying which rows correspond to Indiana and Alabama since those are the states mentioned in the claim.\n\nRow 1: New Hampshire\nRow 2: Alabama (3)\nRow 3: Pennsylvania (3)\nRow 4: California (3)\nRow 5: Indiana (3)\n\nSo, row 2 is Alabama and row 5 is Indiana. \n\nNow, I need to check the 'successor' column for both these rows.\n\nFor Row 2 (Alabama): The successor is Benjamin Fitzpatrick (d). His name starts with B, so it's not William. Therefore, the claim about Alabama having a successor named William is false.\n\nNext, looking at Row 5 (Indiana): The successor is Graham N Fitch (d). Again, this doesn't start with William. So, neither of them has a successor named William.\n\nWait, but I should double-check in case there's a mistake. Let me look again:\n\nAlabama's successor: Benjamin Fitzpatrick\nIndiana's successor: Graham N Fitch\n\nNeither is William. Therefore, the claim that both successors are named William is false because neither one matches.\n\nI don't see any other William in the table either. The only names are John Parker Hale, Benjamin Fitzpatrick, William Bigler, William M Gwin, and Graham N Fitch. So, while there are two Williams (Pennsylvania and California), they're not the successors for Indiana or Alabama.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both Indiana and Alabama have successors named William.

Each row corresponds to a specific state and some details about legislative changes.\n\nThe claim is stating that California is the only state in class 2. From the table provided, I need to check if any other states are listed under class 2 besides California.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: New Hampshire (2) - This is a class 2 state. The vacator is vacant, and the successor is John Parker Hale (R), installed on July 30, 1855. So, this shows that New Hampshire is in class 2.\n\n2. **Row 2**: Alabama (3) - Class 3 here, so not relevant to our claim about class 2.\n\n3. **Row 3**: Pennsylvania (3) - Again, class 3, so no impact on the claim.\n\n4. **Row 4**: California (3) - Wait a minute, this row shows California as class 3. But the claim is that California is in class 2 and is the only one. This directly contradicts the claim because if California is listed under class 3, then it can't be the only state in class 2.\n\n5. **Row 5**: Indiana (3) - Another class 3 entry.\n\nSo, from this analysis, New Hampshire is in class 2, and California is in class 3 according to row 4. Therefore, the claim that California is the only class 2 state is false because there's another state, New Hampshire, in class 2.\n\nI should also verify if any other rows might have class 2 entries beyond what I initially thought. Scanning through again, only Row 1 (New Hampshire) has class 2. All others are either class 3 or not relevant. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because there's more than one state in class 2\u2014specifically, New Hampshire and California is actually in class 3.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the claim is FALSE because California isn't even a class 2 state; it's in class 3, and another state (New Hampshire) is also in class 2.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that California is the only class 2 state.

Successor is Benjamin Fitzpatrick (D) with installation on November 26, 1855. Not relevant to John Hale.\n\nRow 3: Pennsylvania (3), successor William Bigler (D) installed January 14, 1856.

So, the task is to determine if the claim \"there be 1 successor that start in 1855 which be william bigler\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.

The name of that successor is William Bigler.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row represents a state with specific details about the successor and their installation date. I'll go through each row to find any successors whose start year is 1855.\n\nRow 1: New Hampshire (class 2) - Successor John Parker Hale (R), installed on July 30, 1855.\n- The date here is clearly in 1855. So this is one successor starting in that year.\n\nRow 2: Alabama (class 3) - Successor Benjamin Fitzpatrick (D), installed on November 26, 1855.\n- Another entry in 1855. Now we have two successors from this year.\n\nRow 3: Pennsylvania (class 3) - Successor William Bigler (D), installed on January 14, 1856.\n- Wait, the date is 1856, not 1855. So William Bigler started in 1856, which doesn't fit the claim.\n\nRow 4: California (class 3) - Successor William M Gwin (D), installed on January 13, 1857.\n- This is after 1855, so no relevance here.\n\nRow 5: Indiana (class 3) - Successor Graham N Fitch (D), installed on February 4, 1857.\n- Also in 1857, so not relevant to the claim.\n\nSo from the table, I found two successors who started in 1855: John Parker Hale and Benjamin Fitzpatrick. However, the claim specifies only one successor starting that year, specifically William Bigler. But looking at Row 3, William Bigler's installation was in January 14, 1856, which is not 1855.\n\nTherefore, the claim has two issues:\n1. It incorrectly states there's only one successor in 1855 when actually there are two.\n2.

So each row's \"successor\" and \"date of successors formal installation\" columns are relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows five successors installed between 1855 and 1857, which contradicts the claim stating there are only two.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"successor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"successor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"successor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"successor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"successor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
