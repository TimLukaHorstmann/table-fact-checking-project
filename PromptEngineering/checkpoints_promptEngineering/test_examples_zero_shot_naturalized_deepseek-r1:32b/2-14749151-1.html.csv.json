    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"neman have a higher position in 2003 than belshina\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what's being asked here.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. It has rows with information about different teams, their locations, venues, capacities, and their positions in 2003. The claim compares the positions of two specific teams: neman and belshina.\n\nI'll go through each row to find where these teams are listed.\n\nLooking at Row 7: team is \"neman\", location is \"grodno\", and position in 2003 is 7. So, neman's position is 7th.\n\nNow, searching for \"belshina\". I see it in Row 10: team is \"belshina\", located in \"bobruisk\", with a position of 10. That means belshina was ranked 10th in 2003.\n\nThe claim says neman has a higher position than belshina. In terms of ranking, a lower numerical value indicates a higher position (like 1st is better than 10th). So, since 7 is less than 10, neman indeed had a higher position than belshina in 2003.\n\nNow, to list the relevant cells for each team:\n\nFor neman:\n- Row index 6 (since rows start at 0) because it's the seventh row.\n- Column \"position in 2003\".\n\nFor belshina:\n- Row index 9 (tenth row).\n- Column \"position in 2003\".\n\nSo, both relevant cells are their respective positions. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim compares the 2003 positions of neman and belshina. Neman was ranked 7th while belshina was 10th, making the statement true.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"position in 2003\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"position in 2003\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"gomel have a higher capacity than belshina\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has several rows, each representing different teams with various details like team name, location, venue, capacity, and position in 2003. My goal is to find the capacities of two specific teams: gomel and belshina.\n\nStarting with gomel, I'll scan through the table. The first row mentions \"team: gomel\" so that's our first point of interest. Looking at the capacity column for this row, it says 11800. So Gomel has a capacity of 11,800.\n\nNext, I need to find Belshina's capacity. Scanning through the rows again, I see Row 10: \"team: belshina\" with a capacity listed as 3550. That means Belshina's venue can hold 3,550 people.\n\nNow, comparing the two capacities: Gomel at 11,800 versus Belshina at 3,550. Clearly, 11,800 is larger than 3,550. So the claim that \"gomel have a higher capacity than belshina\" holds true.\n\nTo make sure I didn't miss anything, I'll double-check both rows again. Row 1 for Gomel and Row 10 for Belshina. Yep, capacities are correct as per my initial assessment. There's no conflicting information elsewhere in the table regarding these two teams' capacities.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because Gomel's capacity (11,800) exceeds Belshina's (3,550).\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"capacity\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"capacity\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"torpedo - ska be 1 of 4 team with location in minsk\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully. It mentions that Torpedo-SKA is one of four teams located in Minsk. So, my goal is to verify how many teams are actually based in Minsk according to the table and check if Torpedo-SKA is indeed among them.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different team with details like location. I'll go through each row to count the number of teams located in Minsk.\n\nStarting from Row 1: Team Gomel is located in Gomel. Not Minsk.\nRow 2: BATE is in Borisov. Also not Minsk.\nRow 3: Dinamo Minsk is clearly in Minsk. That's one team.\nRow 4: Torpedo-SKA is listed as being in Minsk. So that's the second team.\nRow 5: Shakhtyor is in Soligorsk. Not Minsk.\nRow 6: Torpedo is in Zhodino, not Minsk.\nRow 7: Neman is in Grodno. Not relevant.\nRow 8: Naftan is in Novopolotsk. No.\nRow 9: Dnepr-Transmash is in Mogilev. No.\nRow 10: Belshina is in Bobruisk. Still no.\nRow 11: Dinamo Brest is in Brest. Not Minsk.\nRow 12: Zvezda-VA-BGU is in Minsk. That's the third team.\nRow 13: Darida is in Minsk Raion, which I think refers to a region near Minsk but not necessarily the city itself. So maybe not counted here.\nRow 14: Slavia is in Mozyr. No.\nRow 15: Lokomotiv is in Vitebsk. Not relevant.\nRow 16: MTZ-RIPo is in Minsk, making it the fourth team.\n\nWait a second, so from my count, there are four teams located in Minsk:\n1. Dinamo Minsk (Row 3)\n2. Torpedo-SKA (Row 4)\n3. Zvezda-VA-BGU (Row 12)\n4. MTZ-RIPo (Row 16)\n\nSo that's four teams total in Minsk, and Torpedo-SKA is indeed one of them. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to list each row where the location is Minsk:\n- Row 3: Team Dinamo Minsk\n- Row 4: Team Torpedo-SKA\n- Row 12: Team Zvezda-VA-BGU\n- Row 16: Team MTZ-RIPo\n\nEach of these rows has the column \"location\" set to Minsk, confirming their locations. So all four teams are correctly identified in the table.\n\nI should also check if there are any other teams that might be mistakenly counted or overlooked. Looking back through each row again, I don't see any additional teams from Minsk beyond these four. \n\nTherefore, the claim accurately states that Torpedo-SKA is one of the four teams based in Minsk.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly identifies Torpedo-SKA as one of four teams located in Minsk.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n1. **Identify Teams in Minsk:** Scan each row to find teams with \"location\" as Minsk.\n   - Row 3: Dinamo Minsk\n   - Row 4: Torpedo-SKA\n   - Row 12: Zvezda-VA-BGU\n   - Row 16: MTZ-RIPo\n2. **Count the Teams:** There are four teams in total located in Minsk.\n3. **Check Claim Validity:** Since Torpedo-SKA is among these four, the claim holds true.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Rows 3 to 4 and 12 to 16 where \"location\" is Minsk.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"mtz - ripo be 1 of 2 team with venue traktor\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It says that mtz-ripo is one of two teams that have a venue named traktor. So, I need to check two things: \n\n1. Does mtz-ripo have a venue called traktor?\n2. Are there exactly two teams with the venue traktor?\n\nLooking at the table, let me find the row for mtz - ripo. Scanning through each row:\n\nRow 12 is \"team: zvezda - va - bgu\", so not this one.\nRow 14 and beyond don't seem relevant either.\n\nWait, actually, Row 16 says team: mtz-ripo, location: minsk, venue: traktor. So yes, mtz-ripo's venue is traktor.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are exactly two teams with venue traktor. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 3: Dinamo Minsk has venue dinamo.\nRow 12: zvezda - va - bgu has venue traktor? Wait, no\u2014looking at Row 12, the venue is traktor as well. Or wait, no, let's check again.\n\nWait, Row 12 says venue: traktor, and team is zvezda-va-bgu in minsk. Then Row 16 is mtz-ripo also with venue traktor. So that would be two teams: zvezda-va-bgu (Row 12) and mtz-ripo (Row 16). \n\nWait, but looking back at the table, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check each row's venue:\n\nLooking through all rows:\n- Row 3: dinamo\n- Row 12: traktor\n- Row 16: traktor\n\nAre there any other venues named traktor? Let me check each row carefully.\n\nRow 1: central\nRow 2: city stadium\nRow 3: dinamo\nRow 4: torpedo\nRow 5: stroitel\nRow 6: torpedo\nRow 7: neman\nRow 8: atlant\nRow 9: spartak\nRow 10: spartak\nRow 11: osk brestskiy\nRow 12: traktor (zvezda-va-bgu)\nRow 13: darida\nRow 14: yunost\nRow 15: central\nRow 16: traktor (mtz-ripo)\n\nSo, only two teams have venue traktor: Row 12 and Row 16.\n\nTherefore, mtz-ripo is indeed one of the two teams with venue traktor. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, compiling the relevant cells:\n\nFor mtz-ripo, we need their row (Row 15? Wait no, let me recount rows.\n\nWait, Row 16 is team: mtz - ripo, so that's correct. And their venue is traktor.\n\nAlso, zvezda - va - bgu in Row 12 has the same venue.\n\nSo relevant cells would be:\n\n- For mtz-ripo (Row 15? Wait no, rows are from 1 to 16 as per the user's input. Let me recount: \n\nWait, the table starts with Row 1 to Row 16. So Row 12 is zvezda - va - bgu, venue traktor.\n\nRow 16 is mtz-ripo, venue traktor.\n\nSo relevant cells are:\n\n{\"row_\": 15? Wait no, the rows in the table provided by the user are from row 1 to row 16 as per their naturalized format. So Row 12 and Row 16 have venues traktor.\n\nWait, let me correct that: looking back at the initial table structure:\n\nRow 15 is team: lokomotiv, venue: central\nRow 16: mtz-ripo, venue: traktor\n\nSo yes, Rows 12 and 16 are the ones with venue traktor.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells for each of these teams would be their row index (starting from 0 or 1? Wait in JSON, it's zero-based or one-based? The user says \"row_\": int. Looking at the example, it uses \"row_index\": 0 and 1, so I think it's zero-based.\n\nWait no, looking back: in the example given by the user:\n\n\"relevant_ cells\": [{\"row_\": 0}, {\"row_\": 1}] etc., but in the table provided here, each row is listed as Row 1 to Row 16. So perhaps the row indices are 0-based? Or maybe it's up to me.\n\nBut given that in the example, they have \"row_index\": 0 and 1 for what would be first and second rows, so I think we need to consider the rows starting at 0.\n\nWait no, looking again: in the user's instruction, the initial table is presented as:\n\n\"You are tasked with...\" etc., and then the assistant responds. The example given by the user shows row indices starting from 0, because in their example, they have {\"row_index\": 0} for the first row.\n\nTherefore, I should adjust my count accordingly. So Row 1 is index 0, Row 2 is index 1, etc., up to Row 16 being index 15.\n\nWait no, perhaps not. The user didn't specify whether rows are zero or one-based in their example; they just showed the indices as 0 and 1 for first two rows. So I think it's safe to assume that row_index starts at 0.\n\nBut in my case, mtz-ripo is in Row 16 of the table, which would be index 15 if starting from zero.\n\nWait, perhaps not: let me recount.\n\nThe user listed:\n\nRow 1\nRow 2\n...\nRow 16\n\nSo to get row indices as per the example (starting at 0), Row 1 is index 0, Row 2 index 1,..., Row 16 would be index 15.\n\nBut looking back at mtz-ripo: it's in Row 16 of the user's table. So that's index 15.\n\nSimilarly, zvezda - va - bgu is in Row 12 (user's numbering), which would be index 11 if zero-based.\n\nSo for each team with venue traktor:\n\n- zvezda - va - bgu: row index 11\n- mtz - ripo: row index 15\n\nAdditionally, to confirm that mtz-ripo has the correct venue, we need to include their row and venue cell. Similarly, for each of the two teams.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be:\n\nFor zvezda - va - bgu (Row 12, index 11):\n\n{\"row_\": 11, \"column\": \"venue\"}? Or perhaps just the row since the column is implied as venue. Wait, in the example provided by the user, they only specified row_index and maybe not the column.\n\nWait, looking at the initial instruction, in their example, it's {\"row_index\": 0}, which I think refers to the entire row. So for our case, we can just specify the rows where the venue is traktor.\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, since each cell corresponds to a specific value, maybe we need to reference both the row and column. However, the example didn't include columns, so perhaps it's sufficient to list the rows that contain the necessary information.\n\nAlternatively, for clarity, we can specify the exact cells (row and column) where the venue is traktor for each team.\n\nBut since in the problem statement, the user says \"You are tasked with...\", and the example shows only row indices, perhaps it's acceptable to list the rows that contain the venues as evidence.\n\nSo compiling:\n\n- Row index 11: zvezda - va - bgu has venue traktor\n- Row index 15: mtz - ripo has venue traktor\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are row indices 11 and 15.\n\nBut perhaps I should also include the team name and venue for clarity. But as per the user's example, they just listed row indices without specifying columns.\n\nSo to follow their format:\n\nThe claim is TRUE, and the relevant rows are 12 (index 11) and 16 (index 15). So in JSON terms:\n\n\"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 11}, {\"row_index\": 15}]\n\nBut I'm not sure if this captures all necessary info. Alternatively, perhaps each team's row is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we should include both the team name and venue in the cells, but since it's more involved, perhaps just listing the rows is enough.\n\nIn any case, based on the above reasoning, the answer is that the claim is TRUE, with mtz-ripo being one of two teams with traktor as their venue.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"mtz-ripo is one of two teams with the venue 'traktor'\" is true. The relevant evidence comes from rows 12 and 16 in the table.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify mtz-ripo's Venue:**  \n   - Locate the row for mtz-ripo, which is found in Row 16 (0-based index 15).  \n   - The venue listed here is 'traktor'.\n\n2. **Find Other Teams with 'traktor' Venue:**  \n   - Scan through all rows to find another team with the same venue.  \n   - Discover that zvezda - va - bgu in Row 12 (0-based index 11) also has the venue 'traktor'.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**  \n   - There are exactly two teams, mtz-ripo and zvezda - va - bgu, with the venue 'traktor'.  \n   - Therefore, the statement is true.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11}, // zvezda - va - bgu's row\n    {\"row_index\": 15}  // mtz-ripo's row\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe claim is TRUE. The teams with the venue 'traktor' are listed in rows 12 and 16 (0-based indices 11 and 15).",

The user has provided a table with several rows of data about different football teams, and they want me to determine if the claim \"torpedo - ska be 1 of 4 team with location in vitebsk\" is TRUE or FALSE.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim carefully. It says that torpedo-ska is one of four teams located in Vitebsk. So my task is to check two things: whether torpedo-ska's location is indeed Vitebsk and how many teams are listed as being from Vitebsk.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row one by one. \n\nStarting with Row 1: Team gomel is located in Gomel, so that's not relevant.\n\nRow 2: Bate is in Borisov, no match.\n\nRow 3: Dinamo Minsk is in Minsk, so not Vitebsk.\n\nRow 4: Torpedo-ska is listed here.

So this is the first team from Vitebsk.\n\nRow 16: MTZ-Ripo is in Minsk, not Vitebsk.\n\nSo only Lokomotiv is listed as being from Vitebsk.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"neman have a higher position in 2003 than lokomotiv\" is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the rows corresponding to neman and lokomotiv in the table.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Row 7: Team is neman, location Grodno. Position in 2003 is 7.\n- Row 15: Team is Lokomotiv, located in Vitebsk. Position in 2003 is listed as \"first league, 1.\" \n\nWait, the position for Lokomotiv is a bit unclear. It says \"position in 2003: first league, 1.\" I think this means they were in the first division (or first league) and their position within that was 1st place.\n\nIn contrast, neman's position is 7th in their respective division or table.\n\nSo comparing their positions:\n- Lokomotiv was ranked higher (position 1 in the first league).\n- Neman was ranked lower at position 7.\n\nSince higher position means a better rank (like 1st being higher than 7th), but the claim is that neman have a higher position than lokomotiv. That would mean neman's position number should be lower or less than Lokomotiv's. But neman is at 7, and Lokomotiv is at 1 in their league.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. If \"position in 2003\" refers to the overall league table, then being in the first league with position 1 would be higher than a team that's in the main table at position 7.\n\nAlternatively, if Lokomotiv is in the second division (first league might mean second tier), and neman is in the top flight but lower placed. But based on the data given, Lokomotiv is listed under \"position in 2003: first league, 1.\" while others have positions 1-14.\n\nAssuming that teams in the main table (rows 1-14) are in the same league, and rows 15-16 are in the first league. So Lokomotiv is actually in a lower tier division but at position 1 there. Meanwhile, neman is in the higher tier division at position 7.\n\nSo in terms of overall standing, neman would have a higher position (7th place) compared to Lokomotiv who is in a lower division (first league, which might be second tier), even though they are first there.\n\nBut this can be confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the main table has teams 1-14 as the top league, and then rows 15-16 are part of the same 2003 season but in a different division.\n\nIf that's the case, Lokomotiv being at position 1 in the first league would be better than neman's position 7 in the main league. But I'm not entirely sure about the structure here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"position in 2003\" is just their rank within their own division or overall.\n\nBut according to the data:\n\n- Neman: position 7\n- Lokomotiv: position first in first league (maybe meaning they are promoted from there)\n\nSo if we consider that the main league positions are 1-14, and then Lokomotiv is in a lower division but at position 1 there, their overall standing might not be higher than neman.\n\nWait, perhaps \"first league\" refers to them being promoted. So Lokomotiv was in first place in the second tier (first league) and got promoted, while neman stayed in the top league but at a lower position.\n\nIn that case, neman's position of 7 is better than Lokomotiv's promotion from the lower division.\n\nBut I'm not entirely certain about how the leagues are structured here. The table lists positions for teams up to row 14 as 9-10-11 etc., and then rows 15-16 have \"first league\" with positions 1 and 2.\n\nSo maybe the main league has 14 teams, and the first league (lower division) has at least two teams. So position-wise, Lokomotiv is in a lower division but top there, while neman is mid-table in the higher division.\n\nThus, neman's overall position is better than Lokomotiv's because they are in a higher division even though their numerical position is 7 versus Lokomotiv's 1 in the lower league.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"neman have a higher position in 2003 than lokomotiv\" would be TRUE.\n\nWait, but actually, sometimes in football leagues, being promoted to a higher division from a lower one means your position is considered better. So if Lokomotiv was first in their league (first league) and got promoted, they might have a higher status than neman who stayed in the top league but didn't win it.\n\nBut the question is about their positions in 2003. If both are in different divisions, it's tricky to compare directly. However, based on the data given, Lokomotiv was first in \"first league\" while neman were 7th elsewhere.\n\nSo if we assume that being in the main table (rows 1-14) is higher than \"first league,\" then neman's position of 7 is better than Lokomotiv's in a lower division.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe task was to determine if neman had a higher position in 2003 compared to lokomotiv. \n\n- **Neman** was ranked **7th** in their respective league (position 7). \n- **Lokomotiv** was ranked **1st** in the \"first league,\" which is likely a lower division.\n\nSince neman was part of the main league andlokomotiv was in a lower division, despite being first there, neman's position is considered higher. \n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{\\text{True}}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"gomel have a higher capacity than mtz - ripo\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the relevant information about each team mentioned in the claim: Gomel and MTZ-Ripo.\n\nStarting with Gomel:\n- Looking at Row 1 of the table, it shows that Gomel's capacity is 11800. So, their venue can hold 11,800 people.\n\nNow, moving on to MTZ-Ripo:\n- I scan through the rows and find MTZ-Ripo in Row 16. Their capacity is listed as 17600. That means their venue can accommodate 17,600 spectators.\n\nComparing both capacities:\n- Gomel's capacity: 11,800\n- MTZ-Ripo's capacity: 17,600\n\nSince 11,800 is less than 17,600, the claim that Gomel has a higher capacity than MTZ-Ripo is not correct. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nTo make sure I didn't miss anything, I'll double-check:\n- Did I get the right rows? Yes, Row 1 for Gomel and Row 16 for MTZ-Ripo.\n- Are the capacities correctly noted? Yes, 11800 vs. 17600.\n\nSo, there's no doubt that the claim is FALSE because Gomel's capacity is indeed lower than MTZ-Ripo's.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Gomel has a higher capacity than MTZ-Ripo. By examining the capacities from their respective rows in the table, we find that Gomel's capacity is 11800, while MTZ-Ripo's is 17600. Since 11800 is less than 17600, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"capacity\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"capacity\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"mtz - ripo be 1 of 2 team with venue atlant\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the team \"mtz - ripo\" in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see that row 16 mentions mtz - ripo. The relevant columns here are \"team\", \"venue\", and \"position in 2003\". \n\nThe claim says that mtz - ripo is one of two teams with venue \"atlant\". So, I need to check the venue for mtz - ripo first. Looking at row 16, the venue is listed as traktor, not atlant. That already seems like a problem because if their venue isn't atlant, they can't be one of two teams with that venue.\n\nBut let's double-check other rows to make sure there are only two teams with venue atlant or if maybe I made a mistake. Looking through all the venues: row 3 has dinamo, row 4 has torpedo, row 5 has stroitel, row 6 has torpedo, row 7 has neman, row 8 has atlant, and so on. Only row 8 has venue \"atlant\". \n\nSo, only one team, naftan in row 8, is using the venue atlant. Therefore, mtz - ripo isn't even at that venue, and there's only one team with venue atlant. This makes the claim FALSE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells for this conclusion. For mtz - ripo, I checked their venue in row 16, column \"venue\". And for all other teams, specifically looking for venues named atlant, which led me to row 8's venue as well. So the relevant cells are the venue of mtz - ripo and the venue of naftan.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because mtz - ripo's venue isn't atlant, and only one team uses that venue.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"bate finish with a higher position than lokomotiv in 2003\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me look at the table carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll search for the rows corresponding to the teams 'bate' and 'lokomotiv'. \n\nLooking through the rows:\n- Row 1: team gomel\n- Row 2: team bate\n- ...\n- Row 15: team lokomotiv\n\nSo, row 2 is about bate. The position in 2003 for bate is listed as 2.\n\nNow, looking at row 15: team lokomotiv has a position of \"first league\", which I think refers to the first division or a lower tier compared to the main league. Since positions are numbered from 1 to 14 in the main table and then rows 15 and 16 mention 'first league', it suggests that these teams are in a different, probably lower league.\n\nIn football leagues, a higher position means better ranking. The main league has teams ranked 1st to 14th, while the first league is likely below them. So, if bate is at position 2 in the main league and lokomotiv is in the first league (which is a lower tier), then bate's position is indeed higher than lokomotiv's.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because 'bate' finished in a higher position (position 2) compared to 'lokomotiv', which was in the first league, indicating a lower standing.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as bate finished in position 2 while lokomotiv was in a lower league.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position in 2003\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"position in 2003\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
