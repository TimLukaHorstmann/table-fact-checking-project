    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the record be 4 - 4 when the attendance at the game be 14489\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It's stating that there's a game where the team's record was 4-4 and the attendance was exactly 14,489 people.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week with details about the game played that week. The columns include week number, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance.\n\nI need to find if there's any row where both the 'record' is 4-4 and the 'attendance' is 14,489.\n\nLet me scan through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Record 1-0, Attendance 21597 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nRow 2: Record 2-0, Attendance 15229 \u2192 No.\nRow 3: Record 2-1, Attendance 20462 \u2192 No.\nRow 4: Record 3-1, Attendance 18372 \u2192 No.\nRow 5: Record 3-2, Attendance 19141 \u2192 No.\nRow 6: Record 4-2, Attendance 12683 \u2192 No.\nRow 7: Record 4-3, Attendance 13002 \u2192 No.\nRow 8: Record 4-4, Attendance 14489 \u2192 This matches the claim. So here, when attendance is 14489, the record is indeed 4-4.\n\nRows beyond this also have different records and attendances, but since I found a match in Row 8, it's sufficient to confirm the claim as TRUE.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE because Row 8 has both 'record' as 4-4 and 'attendance' as 14489.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Row 8 shows the record as 4-4 with an attendance of 14489.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"November 6, 1980 be the only record of a tied game that year\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions November 6, 1980 as having a tied game. The word \"be\" seems like it's supposed to be \"was\" maybe? So perhaps the intended meaning is that on November 6, 1980, there was a tied game and that this was the only tied game that year.\n\nLooking at the table provided, all the dates are in 1960. The opponent teams include names like Boston Patriots, Buffalo Bills, New York Titans, etc., which align with the 1960s era since some of these teams were part of the American Football League (AFL) around that time.\n\nNow, the claim is about November 6, 1980. But in the table, all entries are from 1960. So right away, there's a discrepancy in the years mentioned. The claim refers to 1980, but the data only goes up to December 10, 1960.\n\nNext, I should check if there was any tied game in the table. Looking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Week 1, September 9, result is W 13-10 \u2013 no tie.\nRow 2: Week 2, September 18, result W 27-21 \u2013 no tie.\nRow 3: Week 3, September 23, L 24-28 \u2013 loss, no tie.\nRow 4: Week 4, October 2, W 31-14 \u2013 win, no tie.\nRow 5: Week 6, October 16, L 19-23 \u2013 loss, no tie.\nRow 6: Week 7, October 23, W 31-24 \u2013 win, no tie.\nRow 7: Week 8, October 30, L 14-17 \u2013 loss, no tie.\nRow 8: Week 9, November 6, Result is L 25-45 \u2013 loss, not a tie. Wait, this date is November 6, but the year in the table is 1960, not 1980. So that's an issue right there.\n\nRow 9: Week 10, November 13, L 7-34 \u2013 loss.\nRow 10: Week 11, November 20, L 10-20 \u2013 loss.\nRow 11: Week 12, November 27, result T 38-38. This is a tie game, but the date here is November 27, 1960, not 1980.\nRow 12: Week 13, December 4, L 27-30 \u2013 loss.\nRow 13: Week 14, December 10, L 33-41 \u2013 loss.\n\nSo in the table, there's only one tied game on November 27, 1960. The claim mentions November 6, 1980 as a tied game and says it was the only one that year. But according to the table, November 6 is a loss (Row 8) in 1960, not a tie, and the tied game was on November 27, 1960.\n\nMoreover, all data is from 1960, so there's no entry for 1980. Therefore, the claim seems to be incorrect because:\n\n1. The year in the claim is 1980, but the table only has data for 1960.\n2. On November 6, 1960 (which is close to 1980), there was a loss, not a tie.\n3. There's a tied game on November 27, 1960, so even within the table, November 6 isn't the only or any tied game.\n\nThus, the claim doesn't hold based on the provided data. The relevant cells would be those that show the result of the games around November 6 and the tied game on November 27.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}",

The claim says, \"the game on november 13 , 1960 be hold at the cotton bowl site.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should parse the claim carefully. It's talking about a specific date: November 13, 1960. So I need to find the row in the table where the date is November 13, 1960. Once I have that row, I can check what the game site was.\n\nLooking at the table, there are rows for each week from 1 to 14, with corresponding dates. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: September 9, 1960\n- Row 2: September 18, 1960\n- Row 3: September 23, 1960\n- Row 4: October 2, 1960\n- Row 5: October 16, 1960\n- Row 6: October 23, 1960\n- Row 7: October 30, 1960\n- Row 8: November 6, 1960\n- Row 9: November 13, 1960\n- Row 10: November 20, 1960\n- Row 11: November 27, 1960\n- Row 12: December 4, 1960\n- Row 13: December 10, 1960\n\nSo the date in question is on row 9. Now, I need to check what the game site was for that game. The claim says it was held at the Cotton Bowl site.\n\nLooking at row 9's details:\n- Week: 10\n- Date: November 13, 1960\n- Opponent: Dallas Texans\n- Result: L 7 - 34\n- Game site: Cotton Bowl\n- Record: 4 -5\n- Attendance: 21000\n\nYes, the game on November 13, 1960, was indeed held at the Cotton Bowl. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI should also make sure there are no other rows with the same date but a different site. Scanning through, all dates seem unique in this table, so row 9 is the only one for November 13. Hence, I can confidently say that the relevant cell is row 9 under \"game site.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}]}",

The claim says: \"on november 13, 1960 the game site be the cotton bowl and the attendance be over 21000.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the table to find the one that has the date November 13, 1960. Scanning through the dates:\n\n- Row 1: September 9\n- Row 2: September 18\n- Row 3: September 23\n- Row 4: October 2\n- Row 5: October 16\n- Row 6: October 23\n- Row 7: October 30\n- Row 8: November 6\n- Row 9: November 13\n\nSo, row 9 is the one with November 13, 1960. Now, I'll check the relevant columns in this row.\n\nThe claim mentions two things: the game site being the Cotton Bowl and attendance over 21000.\n\nLooking at row 9:\n\n- Game Site: Cotton Bowl\n- Attendance: 21000\n\nWait, so the game site is indeed the Cotton Bowl. That part matches. But the attendance is exactly 21000, not over 21000 as the claim states. The claim says \"over,\" which would mean more than 21000, like 21001 or higher.\n\nSince the attendance is exactly 21000 and not exceeding that number, the second part of the claim isn't true. Therefore, even though the game site is correct, the attendance doesn't meet the \"over\" condition. So the entire claim isn't fully supported because one part (attendance) is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table data provided. It looks like there are 13 rows, each representing a different week of games in 1960. Each row has several columns: week number, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance.\n\nThe claim is about two things happening together: the team's record being 4-4 and the attendance at that game being 9928. So I need to find if there's any row where both these conditions are met.\n\nI'll start by looking for the row with attendance of exactly 9928. Scanning through each row's attendance:\n\n- Row 1: 21597\n- Row 2: 15229\n- Row 3: 20462\n- Row 4: 18372\n- Row 5: 19141\n- Row 6: 12683\n- Row 7: 13002\n- Row 8: 14489\n- Row 9: 21000\n- Row 10: 20778\n- Row 11: 7785\n- Row 12: 5861\n- Row 13: 9928\n\nSo, the attendance of 9928 is in row 13. Now I'll check what the record was on that week.\n\nLooking at row 13's 'record' column, it says 4 - 8 - 1. Wait, that doesn't match the claim which states 4-4. The record here is worse than that; actually, it's more losses and a tie.\n\nSo, even though the attendance was 9928 in row 13, the team's record wasn't 4-4 at that point\u2014it was 4-8 with one tie. Therefore, both conditions of the claim aren't satisfied together in any row. \n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states two simultaneous conditions: a specific attendance and record. Checking each row for these values reveals no such occurrence where both are true.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
