Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table and check for the home teams with a score of 9.7. \n\nRow 1: Home team is Hawthorn with a score of 14.10 (94). Not matching.\nRow 2: South Melbourne scored 20.9 (129). Doesn't match.\nRow 3: Essendon's score was 7.12 (54). Nope.\nRow 4: Melbourne had 9.7 (61).

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"collingwood and st kilda have an average away team score of 15.14\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the table. It has six rows, each representing a game with details like home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd, and date. The claim mentions two teams: Collingwood and St Kilda as away teams. I need to find their respective away scores in the table.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 1: Home is Hawthorn vs Away North Melbourne. So not relevant for Collingwood or St Kilda.\n- Row 2: South Melbourne vs Geelong. Again, no mention of the two teams.\n- Row 3: Essendon vs Collingwood. Here, Collingwood is the away team. Their score is 12.14 (86). So that's one data point.\n- Row 4: Melbourne vs St Kilda. St Kilda is the away team here with a score of 18.14 (122).\n- Rows 5 and 6 don't involve either Collingwood or St Kilda as away teams.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the average of these two scores. The scores are given in the format of goals.behinds (total points). For Collingwood: 12 goals and 14 behinds, totaling 86 points. For St Kilda: 18 goals and 14 behinds, totaling 122 points.\n\nWait, but the claim states \"average away team score\" of 15.14. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because scores are typically in goals.behinds format, not averaging to another goals.behinds figure. Maybe it's referring to averaging their total points and converting back? Or perhaps they're looking at the average of their goal and behind statistics separately?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"average\" here refers to taking the two away team scores (12.14 and 18.14) and calculating an average in goals and behinds.\n\nLet's compute that:\n\nFor Collingwood: 12 goals, 14 behinds.\nFor St Kilda: 18 goals, 14 behinds.\n\nAverage goals = (12 + 18)/2 = 30/2 = 15\nAverage behinds = (14 + 14)/2 = 28/2 = 14\n\nSo the average would be 15.14, which matches exactly what's in the claim.\n\nWait, but I should double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy. Let me look again:\n\nCollingwood's away score is indeed 12.14 (86) and St Kilda's is 18.14 (122). Yes, so averaging goals: 15, behinds: 14.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Collingwood and St Kilda have an average away team score of 15.14 when they were away teams in their respective matches on June 12, 1965 (Collingwood) and June 14, 1965 (St Kilda). By examining rows 3 and 4, we find that Collingwood scored 12.14 and St Kilda scored 18.14 as away teams. Averaging these scores gives us an average of 15.14 goals and behinds, confirming the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine if this statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asserting. It seems to say that Melbourne was not one of the home teams playing on June 12, 1965. So, my task is to check all games played on that date and see if Melbourne was a home team in any of them.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows, each representing a game with details like home team, away team, venue, etc., along with dates. I need to focus on rows where the date is June 12, 1965, and check if Melbourne appears as a home team in any of those.\n\nStarting with Row 1: The date here is 12 June 1965. The home team is Hawthorn, so that doesn't involve Melbourne as a home team.\n\nMoving to Row 2: Again, the date is 12 June 1965. Here, the home team is South Melbourne. Although it's called South Melbourne, I need to be careful because the claim refers to \"melbourne\". However, in sports teams, sometimes abbreviations or different names are used, but in this context, it seems like \"South Melbourne\" is a separate entity from \"Melbourne\". So, this row doesn't involve the home team being Melbourne either.\n\nRow 3 has the date 12 June 1965 as well. The home team here is Essendon, so again, not relevant to our claim about Melbourne.\n\nNow, checking Row 4: This entry is from 14 June 1965, which is a different day than specified in the claim. So, I can disregard this row for now since it's outside the date we're considering.\n\nRows 5 and 6 are also on 14 June 1965, so they don't apply to our query either.\n\nAfter examining all rows with the date of 12 June 1965 (rows 1, 2, and 3), I don't see any instance where Melbourne is listed as a home team. Therefore, the claim that Melbourne was not one of the home teams on that date seems to hold true.\n\nI should make sure there are no other entries for June 12 with Melbourne as a home team. From the given data, it appears that Melbourne only played as a home team on June 14 against St Kilda, but since that's a different day, it doesn't affect our claim.\n\nSo, based on the evidence in the table, the statement is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Melbourne was not a home team on June 12, 1965. By examining rows with that date, we find no entry where Melbourne is listed as the home team, confirming the claim's validity.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the game at mcg be the game that have the second largest crowd\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It has six rows, each representing a different game with details like home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd size, and date. The claim is about the game at the MCG having the second-largest crowd.\n\nTo verify this, my first step is to identify which row corresponds to the MCG. Looking through the 'venue' column:\n\n- Row 1: Glenferrie Oval\n- Row 2: Lake Oval\n- Row 3: Windy Hill\n- Row 4: MCG\n- Rows 5 and 6: Western Oval and Brunswick Street Oval\n\nSo, Row 4 is the game at the MCG. The crowd size for this game is listed as 72114.\n\nNext, I need to list all the crowd sizes from each row to determine their order:\n\n1. Row 1: 11000\n2. Row 2: 32260\n3. Row 3: 34900\n4. Row 4 (MCG): 72114\n5. Row 5: 25345\n6. Row 6: 20140\n\nNow, I'll sort these crowd numbers from largest to smallest:\n\n- Largest: 72114 (Row 4)\n- Next, the next largest would be the second position.\n\nLooking at the other rows:\n\n- The next highest is Row 3 with 34900\n- Then Row 2 with 32260\n- Followed by Row 5: 25345\n- Then Row 1: 11000 and Row 6: 20140\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Let me list them again in order:\n\n1. 72114 (Row 4) - Largest\n2. 34900 (Row 3)\n3. 32260 (Row 2)\n4. 25345 (Row 5)\n5. 20140 (Row 6)\n6. 11000 (Row 1)\n\nSo, the second-largest crowd is actually Row 3 with 34900 at Windy Hill. The MCG game has the largest crowd.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 72114 is clearly larger than all others. So, MCG has the largest, and the next would be 34900 (Row 3). Therefore, the claim says that the MCG game is the second-largest, which is incorrect because it's actually the first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me list all crowd sizes again:\n\n- Row 1: 11,000\n- Row 2: 32,260\n- Row 3: 34,900\n- Row 4: 72,114 (MCG)\n- Row 5: 25,345\n- Row 6: 20,140\n\nNow, sorted:\n\n1. 72,114 (Row 4 - MCG) - Largest\n2. 34,900 (Row 3) - Second largest\n3. 32,260 (Row 2)\n4. 25,345 (Row 5)\n5. 20,140 (Row 6)\n6. 11,000 (Row 1)\n\nSo, the MCG game is indeed the largest crowd, not the second-largest. Therefore, the claim that \"the game at mcg be the game that have the second largest crowd\" is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to check are:\n\n- For each row's 'crowd' column to determine their sizes.\n- Specifically, for the MCG (Row 4), we need its crowd size and compare it with others.\n\nSo, the relevant cells include all crowd figures from Rows 1 to 6 but focusing on Row 4 and the others to establish the order. However, since the answer is FALSE, I only need to show that the MCG has the largest, not second.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim mentions Fitzroy as a home team with a specific score of 9.7. My goal is to verify if there are any other home teams that also have the same score.\n\nStarting with Row 1: Home team is Hawthorn, and their score is 14.10.

Wait, that's exactly the score mentioned in the claim! But wait, Fitzroy isn't the only one then because Melbourne also has 9.7 as their score when they were the home team.\n\nRow 5: Footscray is the home team with a score of 9.11. Close to 9.7 but not exactly.\n\nFinally, Row 6: Fitzroy is indeed the home team with a score of 9.7.

Here, 18 is greater than 14, which doesn't meet the condition.\n\nSince both teams need to have an average below 14, but St Kilda's score is above 14, the overall claim isn't true for both teams. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are Collingwood's away team score in Row 3 and St Kilda's away team score in Row 4.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"melbourne play at home on june 12 1965\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts: checking if Melbourne played a home game and verifying that it was on June 12, 1965.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Home team is Hawthorn. Date is June 12. Not relevant for Melbourne.\nRow 2: Home team is South Melbourne. Date is June 12. Still not the Melbourne team we're looking for.\nRow 3: Home team is Essendon. Date is June 12. Again, not Melbourne.\nRow 4: Here's a match where the home team is Melbourne. The date here is June 14, which doesn't match the claim of June 12.\nRows 5 and 6 are on June 14 as well, so they don't help.\n\nSo, from all rows, Melbourne played at home but not on June 12\u2014it was two days later on June 14. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because the date doesn't match.\n\nThe relevant cells to check were:\n- Row 4: Home team and Date columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
