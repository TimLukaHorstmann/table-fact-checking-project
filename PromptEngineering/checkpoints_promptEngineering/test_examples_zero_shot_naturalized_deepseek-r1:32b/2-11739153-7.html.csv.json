The claim says: \"during the 2007 - 08 minnesota wild season, the score be the same on february 27 and february 29.\"\n\nFirst, I'll check which rows in the table correspond to February 27 and February 29.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 13: date is February 27. The visitor is Minnesota, home is Tampa Bay. The score is 3 - 2. So the score here is 3 for Minnesota and 2 for Tampa Bay.\n\nRow 14: date is February 29. Visitor is Minnesota, home is Florida. Score is 3 - 2 again. So same as before: 3-2.\n\nSo both games have a score of 3-2, which means the scores are indeed the same on those two dates.\n\nI should note that the claim mentions the \"minnesota wild season,\" but in each case, Minnesota is either visitor or home, so it's consistent with their season. The years mentioned are 2007-08, and the table doesn't specify the year, but given the context of a hockey season, this makes sense.\n\nSo based on this, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe scores for February 27 (3-2) and February 29 (3-2) are the same. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says that during the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, both matches on February 12 and February 20 had the same decision.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table provided. Each row represents a game with details like date, visitor, home, score, decision, etc. The relevant information here is the 'decision' column for the specified dates.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- For February 12: Let's see which row that is. Scanning down, I find Row 6 has the date February 12. In this row, the visitor is Minnesota, playing against Edmonton. The decision is listed as Harding.\n\n- Next, for February 20: Checking the table again, Row 10 is dated February 20. Here, the visitor is Minnesota facing Chicago. The decision column shows Harding again.\n\nSo both games on February 12 and February 20 have the same decision maker, Harding. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"decision\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"during the 2007-08 minnesota wild season, the score on february 10 and february 24 be 2 - 1.\"\n\nFirst, I need to check each date mentioned in the claim: February 10 and February 24. So I'll go through the table rows one by one.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 14 rows, each representing a game with details like date, visitor, score, home team, etc. Let's start with February 10.\n\nI scan down to find the row where the date is February 10. That's Row 5. The score in that row is listed as 2 - 1. So on February 10, Minnesota played against St. Louis and won 2-1. So that part of the claim matches.\n\nNext, I need to check February 24. Looking through the rows again, I find Row 11 with the date February 24. The score here is 2 - 1 as well. But wait, in this case, the visitor was Calgary and the home team was Minnesota. So the score was Calgary 2 - 1 Minnesota. So it's a loss for Minnesota on that day.\n\nThe claim mentions both dates having a score of 2-1. However, I need to clarify what \"score\" refers to here. If it means that the final score was 2-1 regardless of which team won, then both games fit: February 10 (Minnesota 2 - 1 St. Louis) and February 24 (Calgary 2 - 1 Minnesota). But if the claim is referring to Minnesota's scores specifically, then on February 24, Minnesota lost 2-1, which might still count as a 2-1 score.\n\nWait, the claim says \"the score on february 10 and february 24 be 2 - 1.\" It doesn't specify who won or if it's just the final score. So both games did end with a 2-1 scoreline. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nNow, I need to collect the relevant cells for each of these dates. For February 10, that's Row 5. The columns involved are date (February 10) and score (2 - 1). Similarly, for February 24, it's Row 11 with the same columns.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells list should include these entries:\n\n- {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"} because rows start from 0. Wait, in the given table, the first row is index 0 or 1? Looking back, the user provided Row 1 to Row 14, but when converted to a list, it's zero-indexed. So February 10 is Row 5, which would be index 4 (since starting from 0). Wait no, wait. Let me recount:\n\nRow 1: index 0\nRow 2: index 1\n...\nRow 5: index 4? No, that can't be right because the first row is index 0. So Row 1 is index 0, Row 2 is index 1, ..., Row 5 is index 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, in programming terms, when we have a list of rows starting from index 0, Row 1 would be index 0, Row 2 index 1, etc. So February 10 is the fifth row (Row 5), so it's at index 4. Similarly, February 24 is Row 11, which would be index 10.\n\nBut wait, in the given data, the rows are numbered from 1 to 14. But when processing as a list in code, they'd start from index 0. So:\n\nRow 1 (date: feb 2) \u2192 index 0\nRow 2 (feb5) \u2192 index1\n...\nRow 5 (feb10) \u2192 index4\nRow 11 (feb24) \u2192 index10\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be for row indices 4 and 10, columns 'date' and 'score'.\n\nWait, no. The claim is about two things: that on feb10, score was 2-1, and on feb24, score was 2-1. So each of these has two relevant cells: date to confirm the day, and score to confirm the result.\n\nSo for February 10 (Row5), which is index4:\n\n- date: 'February 10' \u2192 column 'date'\n- score: '2 - 1' \u2192 column 'score'\n\nSimilarly, for February 24 (Row11, index10):\n\n- date: 'February 24' \u2192 column 'date'\n- score: '2 - 1' \u2192 column 'score'\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells should include four entries:\n\n- Row4 (index4), 'date'\n- Row4 (index4), 'score'\n- Row10 (index10), 'date'\n- Row10 (index10), 'score'\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, each row is considered as per its index. So perhaps I need to list all four cells: two for each date.\n\nSo putting it all together, the answer should be \"TRUE\" with these relevant_cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that on February 10 and February 24, the scores were both 2-1. Checking the table:\n\n- On February 10 (Row5), the score is 2 - 1 (Minnesota won).\n- On February 24 (Row11), the score is 2 - 1 (Calgary won against Minnesota).\n\nBoth dates have a score of 2-1, so the claim is true. The relevant cells are:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"during the 2007 - 08 minnesota wild season , the decision be backstrom 11 time more than it be harding\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is stating. It seems like it's saying that Backstrom made the decision (probably as a goalie making saves or something) 11 times more frequently than Harding did during that season.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, visitor, home, score, decision, etc. The \"decision\" column probably refers to who was the starting goalie for the team, maybe indicating who was responsible for the win or loss in terms of their performance.\n\nSo I need to count how many times Backstrom and Harding were listed under the \"decision\" column.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Row 1: Decision is Backstrom\n2. Row 2: Backstrom\n3. Row 3: Backstrom\n4. Row 4: Backstrom\n5. Row 5: Harding\n6. Row 6: Harding\n7. Row 7: Backstrom\n8. Row 8: Backstrom\n9. Row 9: Backstrom\n10. Row 10: Harding\n11. Row 11: Backstrom\n12. Row 12: Backstrom\n13. Row 13: Backstrom\n14. Row 14: Backstrom\n\nNow, let's count the occurrences:\n\nBackstrom appears in rows 1,2,3,4,7,8,9,11,12,13,14. That's 11 times.\n\nHarding is in rows 5 and 6 (and row 10? Wait, looking again: row 5 is Harding, row 6 is Harding, row 10 is Harding as well). So that's 3 times.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRow 5: Harding\n\nRow 6: Harding\n\nRow 10: Harding\n\nSo total of 3 times for Harding.\n\nBackstrom has 11 decisions. The claim says Backstrom was the decision 11 times more than Harding. But 11 is not 11 times more than 3; rather, it's about 3 and two-thirds times as much (since 11 divided by 3 is approximately 3.666). \n\nWait, no. The claim says Backstrom was the decision \"11 time more\" which I think means that he had 11 more decisions than Harding. But in reality, Backstrom had 11 and Harding had 3, so Backstrom has 8 more (11-3=8). Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it's not 11 times more; rather, it's 8 more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding \"times more\". If someone says A is X times more than B, that usually means A = B + X*B. So if Harding had H decisions and Backstrom had B = H + 11*H = 12H. But in our case, B is 11 and H is 3. Does 11 equal 3 + 11*3? No, because that would be 36. So the claim might not hold.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The user's wording says \"Backstrom 11 time more than it be Harding\". Perhaps they mean Backstrom had 11 decisions and Harding had something else. But in reality, Backstrom has 11 and Harding has 3, so the claim that Backstrom was the decision 11 times more than Harding isn't accurate because 11 is not 11 times more than 3. Instead, it's roughly three times more.\n\nSo based on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Backstrom made decisions 11 times more than Harding during the season. However, according to the table, Backstrom was listed as the decision-maker in 11 games, while Harding was in 3. Since 11 is not 11 times more than 3, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Decision\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"during the 2007-08 minnesota wild season, minnesota play home 2 times less than they play away\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim means. The team is playing fewer home games by two times compared to away games. So, if they played H home games and A away games, the claim suggests that H = (A/2) - 2 or something along those lines? Wait, actually, \"2 times less than\" can be ambiguous. It might mean H = A / 2, which is half as many home games as away games.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game where Minnesota was either the visitor (away) or the home team. I need to count how many home and away games they played during this season.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Visitor is Minnesota, so it's an away game.\nRow 2: Home is Minnesota, home game.\nRow 3: Home is Minnesota, home game.\nRow 4: Home is Minnesota, home game.\nRow 5: Visitor is Minnesota, away.\nRow 6: Visitor is Minnesota, away.\nRow 7: Visitor is Minnesota, away.\nRow 8: Home is Minnesota, home.\nRow 9: Home is Minnesota, home.\nRow 10: Visitor is Minnesota, away.\nRow 11: Visitor is Minnesota, away.\nWait, no. Row 11 says visitor is Calgary and home is Minnesota. So that's a home game for Minnesota.\n\nRow 12: Visitor is Minnesota, so they're playing away.\nRow 13: Visitor is Minnesota, away.\nRow 14: Visitor is Minnesota, away.\n\nNow let me count:\n\nAway games (visitor): Rows 1,5,6,7,10,12,13,14. That's 8 away games.\n\nHome games (home): Rows 2,3,4,8,9,11. Let's see: Row 2 is home, row3 home, row4 home, row8 home, row9 home, and row11 is visitor: no, wait row11's visitor is Calgary, so home is Minnesota\u2014so that's another home game.\n\nWait, I think I miscounted earlier. Let me recount:\n\nHome games:\nRow 2: yes\nRow3: yes\nRow4: yes\nRow8: yes\nRow9: yes\nRow11: yes (home is Minnesota)\nSo that's 6 home games.\n\nAway games:\nRows 1,5,6,7,10,12,13,14\u2014so 8 away games.\n\nThe claim says they played home 2 times less than away. So if away is A=8, home should be H = (A/2) - 2? Or H = A / 2?\n\nWait, the way it's phrased: \"play home 2 time less than they play away.\" That could mean H = A - 2* something. Alternatively, maybe the user means that the number of home games is half the number of away games minus two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's interpreted as H = (A / 2) - 2? Let's test:\n\nIf H should be equal to (8/2) - 2 = 4-2=2. But in reality, H is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother interpretation: \"they play home two times less than they play away\" could mean that the number of home games is half of the away games minus two more? Or perhaps it's a way to say H = (A / 2) - 2. But again, A=8, so H would be 4-2=2, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"2 times less than\" means that H is half of A. So if A=8, then H should be 4. But in reality, H=6, which is more than 4.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is saying that they played home games two times fewer than away games. That could mean H = (A / 2). If A=8, H would be 4. But actual H is 6, so it's not less; it's actually more home games than half of away games.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is interpreted as H = A - 2. So if A=8, H should be 6. And indeed, that's exactly what we have here: H=6 and A=8. So H = A - 2.\n\nSo according to this interpretation, the claim would be TRUE because 6 = 8-2.\n\nBut wait, is \"two times less\" commonly understood as subtracting two? Or does it mean dividing by two?\n\nIn common usage, \"times less than\" can sometimes lead to confusion. For example, saying something is twice as much as another could mean double, but \"twice less\" isn't standard. So the phrase might be ambiguous.\n\nBut in this case, if we take \"two times less than away games,\" it's possible that it means H = (A / 2). In that case, A=8, so H should be 4. But actual home games are 6, which is more than 4. So the claim would be FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, interpreting it as playing two fewer home games compared to away games: H = A - 2. Here, A=8, so H=6, which matches the data. Thus, the claim is TRUE.\n\nBut this depends on interpretation. Since \"two times less than\" isn't a standard phrasing, but in some contexts, people might mean subtracting two. However, more commonly, it could be interpreted as dividing by two.\n\nGiven that, if H should be 4 (8/2), but actual H is 6, the claim would be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, another approach: perhaps \"two times less than\" means they played home games in half the number of away games minus two. So, A=8, so (A - 2) = 6. That's exactly what we have. So that would make H=6, which matches. Thus, TRUE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to stick with the common interpretation: \"two times less than\" meaning half as many. In that case, since H is not 4 but 6, it's FALSE.\n\nThis ambiguity makes it a bit tricky. However, considering the context and possible intended meaning, perhaps the claim is trying to say they played two fewer home games than away games, which would be TRUE because 8-2=6.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about this interpretation. It could go either way based on how \"two times less\" is understood.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Minnesota played 6 home games and 8 away games during the season. The claim states they played home games two times less than away games, which can be interpreted as H = A - 2 (6=8-2), making it TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Home\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"During the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, Minnesota lose by more than 2 on February 27 and February 29.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. Each row represents a game with details like date, visitor, score, home team, decision, attendance, and record. The key columns for this claim are 'date' and 'score', as well as perhaps 'visitor' to confirm it's Minnesota losing.\n\nI need to check two specific dates: February 27 and February 29. Let me go through each row:\n\n- **Row 1**: Date is February 2, not relevant.\n- **Row 2**: February 5, not our target date.\n- **Row 3**: February 7, nope.\n- **Row 4**: February 9, still not matching.\n- **Row 5**: February 10, visitor is Minnesota but it's a home game? Wait, in the table, 'home' is where the team is playing. So for Row 5, the visitor is Minnesota, and they played against St. Louis at home. The score was 2-1, so Minnesota won here.\n  \nWait, actually, looking again: the format seems to be visitor vs home, with the score as visitor's score first. So in Row 5, it's Visitor: Minn (score: 2) and Home: St. Louis (score: 1). So Minn won by 1.\n\nContinuing:\n\n- **Row 6**: February 12, visitor is Minn, played against Edmonton, score 2-4. So Minn lost by 2 goals. But the claim mentions losing by more than 2 on both dates, so this loss was exactly by 2, which doesn't meet \"more than 2.\"\n\n- **Row 7**: February 14, visitor is Minn against Vancouver, score 5-4. Minn lost by 1.\n\n- **Row 8**: February 17, Visitor: Nashville vs Home: Minn, score 4-5. So Minn won by 1 as the home team.\n\n- **Row 9**: February 19, Visitor: Vancouver vs Minn (home). Score 3-2, so Minn lost by 1. Not more than 2.\n\n- **Row 10**: February 20, Minn is visitor against Chicago. Score 0-3. So Minn lost by 3 goals here. That's more than 2.

Let me check again for February 27 and 29 specifically.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\n- **Row 13**: Date is February 27. Visitor: Minn vs Home: Tampa Bay. Score: 3-2. So the visitor (Minn) scored 3, home team scored 2. Wait, that means Minn won by 1 goal here because they are the visitor.\n\nWait no, wait. The score is given as visitor's score first. So in Row 13, Visitor: Minn (score 3), Home: Tampa Bay (score 2). So Minn won 3-2 on February 27. That's a win, not a loss by more than 2.\n\nNext, **Row 14**: Date is February 29. Visitor: Minn vs Home: Florida. Score: 3-2. Again, visitor (Minn) scored 3, home scored 2. So Minn won again here as well. Thus, they didn't lose on either date; instead, they won both games.\n\nWait a second\u2014that's conflicting with the initial thought. Let me double-check each row:\n\nLooking at Row 13: February 27, Visitor is Minn, score 3-2 (visitor's points first), so Minn won by 1. So that's not a loss.\n\nRow 14: February 29, same structure\u2014Visitor Minn, score 3-2, meaning Minn won again.\n\nSo both games on those dates were wins for Minnesota, not losses. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because on neither of these dates did Minnesota lose by more than 2 goals; they actually won both games.\n\nWait, but perhaps I misread the columns. Let me check: in each row, is 'visitor' the team visiting? Yes. So Visitor score comes first, then Home's score. So if Visitor is Minn and their score is higher, it's a win for them.\n\nSo the claim says they lost by more than 2 on both dates, but according to the table, they won both games. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Minnesota lost by more than 2 goals on February 27 and February 29. However, checking these dates:\n\n- **February 27 (Row 13)**: Visitor Minn vs Tampa Bay, score 3-2 \u2192 Minn won by 1 goal.\n- **February 29 (Row 14)**: Visitor Minn vs Florida, score 3-2 \u2192 Minn won by 1 goal.\n\nSince both games were wins for Minnesota, the claim is FALSE. The relevant data points are the scores on those dates showing they did not lose.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"during the 2007 - 08 minnesota wild season , minnesota play at home more time than they play away.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to understand how many times Minnesota played as the home team versus visiting other teams.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Home is Columbus, so Minnesota was visiting. That's an away game.\nRow 2: Home is Minnesota. So this is a home game for them.\nRow 3: Home is Minnesota. Another home game.\nRow 4: Home is Minnesota.

Let me check again. No, row 7 shows visitor as Minnesota and home as Vancouver. So that's an away game.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Let's count:\n\nRow 10: Visitor \u2192 Away\nRow 11: Visitor? No, row 11 shows visitor as Calgary; so this time, Minnesota is at home. So that's a home game (sixth).\nRow 12: Visitor is Minnesota \u2192 Away.\nRow 13: Visitor is Minnesota \u2192 Away.\nRow 14: Visitor is Minnesota \u2192 Away.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused.

That's six home games.\n\nAway games are when 'visitor' is Minnesota:\n\nRow 1: Yes\nRow5: Yes\nRow6: Yes\nRow7: Visitor is Minnesota? No, row7 shows visitor as Minnesota? Let me check:\n\nWait, in row7, the 'visitor' is minnesota and home is Vancouver. So yes, that's an away game for them.\n\nRows 10,12,13,14: All have visitor as Minnesota \u2192 four more away games.\n\nSo total home games: rows 2,3,4,8,9,11 \u2192 6 games.\nAway games: rows1,5,6,7,10,12,13,14 \u2192 8 games.\n\nWait, that's 6 home vs. 8 away. So more away games than home. But the claim says they played at home more than away. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I miscounted? Let me recount:\n\nHome games:\nRow2: Home\nRow3: Home\nRow4: Home\nRow8: Home (visitor is Nashville)\nRow9: Home (visitor is Vancouver)\nRow11: Home (visitor is Calgary)\n\nSo 6 home games.\n\nAway games:\nRow1: Visitor\nRow5: Visitor\nRow6: Visitor\nRow7: Visitor\nRow10: Visitor\nRow12: Visitor\nRow13: Visitor\nRow14: Visitor\n\nThat's 8 away games.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So the claim is about whether during the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, Harding made more decisions than Backstrom. Hmm, okay, so I need to check how many times each of them was the decision-maker in the games listed.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are 14 rows, each representing a game with details like date, visitor, score, home team, decision, attendance, and record. The key column here is \"decision,\" which shows who made the final decision for that game. \n\nFirst, I should go through each row and count how many times Harding and Backstrom are listed under the \"decision\" column.\n\nStarting from Row 1: Decision is Backstrom.\nRow 2: Backstrom again.\nRow 3: Backstrom.\nRow 4: Backstrom.\nRow 5: Harding. So that's one for Harding.\nRow 6: Harding, so two.\nRow 7: Backstrom. Hmm, but wait, in Row 7 it says \"decision: backstrom,\" so that would be another Backstrom decision.\nRow 8: Backstrom again.\nRow 9: Backstrom.\nRow 10: Harding. So now Harding has three decisions.\nRow 11: Backstrom.\nRow 12: Backstrom.\nRow 13: Backstrom.\nRow 14: Backstrom.\n\nWait, let me recount to make sure I didn't miss anything. \n\nBackstrom's decisions are in Rows 1,2,3,4,7,8,9,11,12,13,14. That seems like 11 times. Harding is in Rows 5,6,10. So that's three times for Harding.\n\nWait a second, but looking back at Row 5: decision is Harding. Then Row 6 also Harding, and Row 10 as well. So yes, three decisions by Harding versus eleven by Backstrom.\n\nSo the claim says that Harding made more decisions than Backstrom, but according to this table, it's actually the opposite. Backstrom was the decision-maker significantly more times. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Harding had more decisions than Backstrom during the 2007-08 season for the Minnesota Wild. By examining each row of the table, we find that Backstrom made decisions in 11 games (Rows 1,2,3,4,7,8,9,11,12,13,14), while Harding only had three decisions (Rows 5,6,10). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_1\": 1, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_2\": 2, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_3\": 3, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_4\": 4, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_5\": 5, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_6\": 6, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_7\": 7, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_8\": 8, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_9\": 9, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_10\": 10, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_11\": 11, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_12\": 12, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_13\": 13, \"column_name\": \"decision\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
