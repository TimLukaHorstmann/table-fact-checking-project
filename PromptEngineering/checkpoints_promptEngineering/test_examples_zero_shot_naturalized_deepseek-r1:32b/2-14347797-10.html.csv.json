    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's see what I need to do here. The user has provided a table in naturalized format and a claim about the opponent on April 14. My task is to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the relevant cells in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table structure. There are five rows, each representing a game with details like game number, date, opponent, score, and series status. The columns are: game, date, opponent, score, series.\n\nThe claim is: \"the opponent for april 14 be the new jersey devil.\" So I need to find if on April 14, the opponent was indeed New Jersey Devils.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: April 8 \u2013 opponent is NJD.\nRow 2: April 10 \u2013 same.\nRow 3: April 12 \u2013 same.\nRow 4: April 14 \u2013 opponent is NJD as well. The score is 3-0, and the series leads are updated here.\nRow 5: April 17 \u2013 still NJD.\n\nSo for April 14, which is Row 4, the opponent column confirms it's New Jersey Devils. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to list the relevant cells. The date in row 4 and the opponent in row 4 are both necessary. So, row_index 3 (since it starts at 0) for date, but wait, actually, each row has a date, so row 4 corresponds to row index 3 if we start counting from 0. But looking back, the rows are numbered 1-5 as per user's input. Wait no, in programming, indexes usually start at 0. So Row 4 is index 3.\n\nWait, let me check: The user provided Row 1 to Row 5. In JSON, when we list row indices, it's zero-based? Or are they one-based here?\n\nIn the example given, the response used \"row_index\": 0 and 1, so I think in this context, rows are 0-indexed. So April 8 is row 0, April 14 would be row 3.\n\nSo relevant cells: date (April 14) is in row 3, column 'date', and opponent in the same row. But wait, actually, to check if April 14's opponent was NJD, we only need the opponent cell from that row. Alternatively, both columns are relevant because the claim ties a specific date to an opponent.\n\nWait, the claim says \"the opponent for april 14 be...\" So I think it's sufficient to look at row where date is April 14 and check the opponent. Therefore, in Row 4 (index 3), column 'opponent' would confirm that the opponent was NJD on April 14.\n\nSo, relevant cells are: row index 3, column 'date' to find it's April 14, and column 'opponent' for the same row. Alternatively, since I can directly look at the opponent for April 14 without checking other rows, perhaps just that cell is sufficient. But the instructions say to list cells relevant to verify the claim.\n\nWait, maybe just the opponent in row where date is april 14. So perhaps it's enough to check column 'opponent' in row 3 (index 3). Alternatively, I need to confirm both the date and the opponent.\n\nHmm, but for a more thorough verification, one might first find the row with April 14, which is row index 3, then check the opponent in that same row. So relevant cells would be:\n\n- {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n- {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n\nBut perhaps just checking the opponent on April 14 is sufficient without needing to confirm the date again since the claim specifies April 14. But maybe it's better to include both to show how we arrived at the conclusion.\n\nWait, looking back at the instructions: \"If fully supported, answer 'TRUE'; otherwise, answer 'FALSE'.\" So I need to make sure that the data supports the claim entirely.\n\nIn this case, since April 14 is present and the opponent is NJD, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are the opponent for April 14. But in terms of how we find it, perhaps both date and opponent columns in row 3 are involved.\n\nBut I think the most straightforward way is to look at the opponent column where the date is April 14. So:\n\nRelevant cells would be:\n\n- For verifying the date: {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n- For verifying the opponent on that date: {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n\nSo both are relevant because they ensure that April 14's opponent is indeed NJD.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the opponent column in row 3 is needed since once we have identified the correct row (April 14), checking the opponent suffices. But to be thorough, including both ensures that we confirm the date and the corresponding opponent.\n\nI think including both makes sense because it shows how we matched the claim's date with the correct row and then checked the opponent there.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
