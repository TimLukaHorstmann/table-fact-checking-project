    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user is asking me to verify a claim about the 2018 season's Air Force-Navy score being \"TBD\" based on the provided table. I need to carefully check each condition in the claim against the table and determine if it's supported.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the data provided. The table seems to have rows corresponding to different seasons from 2014 onwards. Each row has details about the trophy winner and the scores for Air Force vs. Navy, Air Force vs. Army, and Army vs. Navy games.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions the 2018 season's Air Force-Navy score being TBD. So, I'll search the table for the row corresponding to the 2018 season. Looking through the rows, I find that Row 42 is for 2014 and continues up to Row 44 for 2018.\n\nIn Row 44 (since indexing starts at 0, but in this case, it's probably easier to count from the top), under \"air force - navy score,\" I see that it's listed as \"tbd.\" That directly matches the claim. So, the relevant cell here is for the Air Force-Navy score in the 2018 season.\n\nI also need to make sure there are no other rows or cells that might contradict this information. Scanning through the rest of the table, I don't see any conflicting data; all other entries either have scores filled in or indicate they're TBD as well, which doesn't affect the claim's validity.\n\nTherefore, since the cell explicitly states \"tbd\" for the Air Force-Navy score in 2018, the claim is fully supported. The answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 44,\n       \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"In 1983, the Air Force - Navy score was 44-17\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. Each row represents a season, starting from what seems to be earlier years up to 2018. The columns include \"season,\" \"trophy winner,\" and scores for Air Force vs. Navy, Air Force vs. Army, and Army vs. Navy.\n\nThe claim is about the year 1983. I'll scan through the table rows looking for a row with season \"1983.\" Scanning down the list:\n\n- Row 0: Season not specified\n- Rows continue up to row 44, which includes seasons from unspecified up to 2018. Notably, the earliest specific season in the table is 1983 at row index 0? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back, the rows are indexed from 0 to 44. Let me look through each row's \"season\" value:\n\n- Row 0: Season not specified, just a header\n- Rows 1 onwards: Seasons start with 1983? Or perhaps row 0 is 1983?\n\nWait, the first data row (row index 0) shows season 1983. Let me confirm:\n\nLooking at the initial table, I see rows starting from what seems to be 1983 up to 2018. The first data row after headers is likely 1983.\n\nSo, in row index 0 (assuming row 0 is the header), then row 1 would be 1983? Wait, I'm a bit confused about how the rows are indexed here.\n\nWait, looking at the user's table, it starts with \"You are tasked...\" and includes a series of rows. The first actual data row after that seems to be for season 1983. Let me check:\n\nThe table provided by the user lists rows from what appears to be starting in 1983 up through 2018. Each row corresponds to a season, with each season having details about the trophy winner and scores.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for 1983, that should be the first data row after the header.\n\nIn the table provided:\n\nRow index 0: Header\nRow index 1: Season 1983\n\nWait, no, actually, the user's table starts with season details without a separate header. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the JSON example, it seems that each row has columns like \"season,\" but in the user's provided data, it's a bit unclear. Wait, perhaps I should look for the exact structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key is to find if 1983 exists in the table and what the Air Force vs Navy score was that year.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow index starts from 0, but it's unclear if row 0 is a header or data. Let me assume that row 0 is data for 1983.\n\nWait, looking back, the user provided a long list of rows, each starting with \"season: [year], trophy winner: ...\", etc.\n\nSo, the first row (row index 0) is season 1983. Let me confirm:\n\nYes, looking at the data, the first entry after the initial instructions is for 1983, then continues up to 2018.\n\nTherefore, in row index 0, the \"season\" is 1983.\n\nNow, checking the Air Force vs Navy score for that year. The claim says it's 44-17.\n\nLooking at row index 0:\n\n\"air force - navy score\": \"44-17\"\n\nYes, exactly as claimed.\n\nSo, the relevant cell would be in row 0 (assuming row indices start at 0), under the column \"air force - navy score.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The user has provided a table with various rows and columns related to different sports seasons and the outcomes of Army-Navy games. The claim is that \"an Army - Navy game will be played on 10 dec 2016 at baltimore , md.\" I need to check if this claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row to find any mention of December 10, 2016. Scanning through rows 40, 41, 42, etc., I see that Row 43 mentions \"10 dec 2016 at baltimore , md.\" in the army-navy score column. This seems to directly match the claim.\n\nBut wait, the relevant cell is under the 'army - navy score' column for row 43. That means the game was scheduled or played on that date and location according to the table. So the claim aligns with this information.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows mentioning December 2016, but it looks like Row 43 is the only one.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the claim \"the score for air force - navy have all be decide up until 2018\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is saying. It states that all the scores between Air Force and Navy have been decided up until the year 2018. So, my goal is to check each row in the table from the earliest year to 2018 to see if there's any instance where the score for Air Force vs. Navy isn't available or marked as TBD.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that it starts from an unspecified year but goes up to 2018. Each row represents a season from 2004 onwards, with some missing entries. The relevant columns are \"air force - navy\" and \"trophy winner\".\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- **Row 37 (2008):** Score is 33-27. Decided.\n- **Row 38 (2009):** Score is 16-13 OT. Decided.\n- **Row 39 (2010):** Score is 14-6. Decided.\n- **Row 40 (2011):** Score is 35-34 OT. Decided.\n- **Row 41 (2012):** Score is 28-21 OT. Decided.\n- **Row 42 (2014):** The score is listed as \"4 oct 2014 at air force\". It looks like the game hasn't been played yet, and the score isn't available; instead, it's just the date and location. So, this is marked as TBD.\n- **Row 43 (2016):** Score for Air Force - Navy is TBD.\n- **Row 44 (2018):** Again, the score is TBD.\n\nWait, I need to check all rows up until 2018. Let me go back a bit:\n\nLooking from row 37 onwards:\n\n- Row 37: 2008 - Decided\n- Row 38: 2009 - Decided\n- Row 39: 2010 - Decided\n- Row 40: 2011 - Decided\n- Row 41: 2012 - Decided\n- Row 42: 2014 - TBD (score not decided)\n- Row 43: 2016 - TBD\n- Row 44: 2018 - TBD\n\nSo, starting from 2014 onwards, there are entries where the Air Force vs. Navy score is marked as TBD. This includes seasons 2014, 2016, and 2018.\n\nTherefore, not all scores up until 2018 have been decided. The claim is false because there are years within that range where the score isn't available yet.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 42, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 43, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 44, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to evaluate the claim: \"all but 1 season be about to have or have an army - navy game in baltimore , md (m& t bank stadium)\". So, first, let me understand what this means.\n\nThe claim is saying that except for one season, all other seasons either have had or are going to have their Army-Navy game at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, MD. My task is to check the table provided and see if this holds true.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row (season) and examine the \"army - navy score\" column because that's where the location of the game would be mentioned.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- Row 0: Season 2014. The army-navy score is listed as \"13 dec 2014 at baltimore , md (m& t bank stadium)\". So, this one is in Baltimore.\n- Row 1: Season 2016. The army-navy game is scheduled for \"10 dec 2016 at baltimore , md (m& t bank stadium)\". That's also in Baltimore.\n- Row 2: Season 2018. The game is on \"8 dec 2018\" but the location isn't specified\u2014it just says that date. So, this one might not be in Baltimore.\n\nNow, checking other rows above row 42 (since rows before 42 are older seasons):\n\nLooking back through the table, from season 2010 to earlier, most of them list the location as Baltimore, MD at M&T Bank Stadium. However, I need to make sure there's only one exception.\n\nWait, in row 38: Season 2009, it says \"army - navy score: 17 3\" without a location mentioned, but actually looking back, I think all except maybe row 42 (2014) and row 43 (2016) have the location. Wait no\u2014rows after 2014 include 2016 and 2018.\n\nWait, in row 42: Season 2014's army-navy game is at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore.\nRow 43: 2016's game is also there. Then row 44 (2018) doesn't specify the location\u2014only the date.\n\nSo, according to this table, except for season 2018, all others have their Army-Navy games at that stadium. So only one exception exists\u2014the claim says \"all but 1\", which fits because only 2018's game isn't specified as being in Baltimore, but maybe it is or isn't? Wait, the claim is about having or about to have\u2014so perhaps for 2018, if it's TBD, then it might not be there. Alternatively, does that count?\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\n- Row 42 (2014): game in Baltimore.\n- Row 43 (2016): game in Baltimore.\n- Row 44 (2018): location is not specified\u2014it just says the date and \"tbd\" for the score. So, it's possible that the location isn't at M&T Bank Stadium, or maybe it is but not specified.\n\nSo if only row 44 doesn't have the location specified as Baltimore, then the claim holds because all other seasons except one (2018) are either there or about to be there. But wait, in the table, I should check if any season before that didn't have it.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Rows from 2010 onwards: 2010's game is at Baltimore.\n- 2011: same.\n- 2012: mentions \"tbd\" but the location is still M&T Bank Stadium as per previous years. Wait, row 41 (2012) says army-navy score: 17 dec 2012 at baltimore , md (m& t bank stadium). So it's in Baltimore.\n- Rows before that, like 2008, the location is also M&T Bank Stadium.\n\nSo actually, only row 44 (2018) doesn't specify the location. Therefore, all but one season have or are about to have their game there. Hence, the claim is TRUE.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, in row 42: season 2014's army-navy score is listed as \"13 dec 2014 at baltimore , md (m& t bank stadium)\", so that's correct.\n\nRow 43 (2016) also has the game there. Row 44 (2018) doesn't have a location specified, but it might still be in Baltimore; perhaps it's just not filled out yet. But according to the table, only row 44 is missing the location detail.\n\nSo yes, all seasons except one are either having or about to have their game there. Thus, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that all but one season have had or will have their Army-Navy game at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, MD holds true based on the provided table. Only the 2018 season does not specify the location, making it the exception.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is TRUE. All seasons except for 2018 have either had or are scheduled to have their Army-Navy game at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, MD. Therefore, the assertion that all but one season meet this criterion is correct.\n\n\\boxed{TRUE}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"for the 1983 season, the air force - navy score be tbd\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that in the 1983 season, the Air Force vs. Navy game had a TBD (to be determined) score. So I'm looking for any row in the table that corresponds to the 1983 season and checks whether the Air Force - Navy score is marked as TBD.\n\nLooking at the provided data, each row represents a different season starting from what seems to be 1983 up to 2018. Let me check the rows for the 1983 season. \n\nWait, actually, looking at the table structure, the first few rows are labeled with seasons like 1983, but when I look closely, the data starts from 1983 and goes up to 2018. Let me count how many rows there are. The last row is row index 44 for season 2018. So each row corresponds to a different year starting from 1983.\n\nWait no, let's check the initial data again. Actually, the user provided rows starting from what looks like 1983 up to 2018, but when I look at the numbers, it starts with \"You are tasked...\" and then provides a series of rows with seasons like 1983 (row index 0), 1984 (row index 1), ..., up to 2018 (row index 44). So each row is for a specific season.\n\nWait, actually, the user's table starts at what seems to be 1983 but in reality, it might not. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\n- The first row after the initial description is labeled as \"Row 0: ...\", and it mentions \"You are tasked...\" which seems like a prompt rather than part of the table. Then there's a series of lines starting with \"Row x: ...\" each describing a season. For example, Row 0 is about 1983, Row 1 is 1984, etc., up to Row 44 for 2018.\n\nSo I need to check if in the row corresponding to the 1983 season (Row 0), whether the Air Force - Navy score is marked as TBD.\n\nLooking at the details of Row 0: \n\n- Season: 1983\n- Trophy winner: TBD?\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nActually, when I look at the data, it's a bit confusing because the initial part seems to be instructions, but then there are lines like \"Row x: ...\" which probably represent each season.\n\nLet me parse this correctly. The user provided a table with rows from 1983 onwards. Each row has columns such as season, trophy winner, Air Force - Navy score, etc.\n\nSo for the claim about 1983, I need to check Row 0 of the table.\n\nLooking at Row 0: \n\n- Season: 1983\n- Trophy winner: The user's data shows \"tbd\" in some later rows but not sure if 1983 is tbd. Wait, no, looking back, actually, in the initial data provided by the user, I don't see a row for 1983 except maybe at Row index 0.\n\nWait, let me recount. The first line after the problem statement says:\n\n\"You are tasked...\".\n\nThen there's a series of lines starting with \"Row x: ...\", each describing a season from 1983 up to 2018, but actually looking closer, it starts at 1983 (row index 0) and goes up to 2018 (row index 44). So row indices go from 0 to 44, each representing a season starting at 1983.\n\nBut when I look through the rows, Row 0 says \"Row 0: ...\" with some data. Let me check what's in Row 0.\n\nLooking at Row 0:\n\n\"Row 0: Season: 1983, Trophy winner: TBD, Air Force - Navy score: tbd, Air Force - Army score: tbd, Army - Navy score: tbd\"\n\nWait no, the actual data provided by the user in the problem is different. Let me parse it again.\n\nThe user provided a series of rows starting with:\n\nRow 0: Season: 1983, Trophy winner: tbd, Air Force - navy score: tbd, etc.\n\nBut actually, looking at the initial data, perhaps Row 0 is not 1983. Let me see the exact data provided by the user.\n\nWait, no, in the problem description, the user wrote:\n\n\"You are tasked... [problem statement] ... You must respond ...\"\n\nThen after that, there's a series of lines starting with \"Row x: Season...\", which I think represent each row in the table. So Row 0 is for season 1983.\n\nSo looking at Row 0:\n\n\"Row 0: Season: 1983, Trophy winner: tbd, Air Force - navy score: tbd\"\n\nWait no, actually, let me parse correctly.\n\nThe user's data shows rows like:\n\nRow 0: Season: 1983, Trophy winner: tbd, Air Force - navy score: tbd\n\nBut in the actual problem, I need to check whether the Air Force - Navy score for 1983 is marked as TBD. So if Row 0 corresponds to 1983 and has \"tbd\" for that game, then the claim would be TRUE.\n\nLooking at Row 0: \n\nYes, in the first row (Row 0), Season: 1983, Trophy winner: tbd, Air Force - navy score: tbd. So yes, the Air Force vs. Navy score is marked as TBD for 1983.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in the 1983 season, the Air Force vs. Navy game had a TBD score. Checking Row 0 of the table, which corresponds to the 1983 season, confirms that the Air Force - Navy score is indeed marked as \"tbd.\" Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n**Answer: TRUE**",
