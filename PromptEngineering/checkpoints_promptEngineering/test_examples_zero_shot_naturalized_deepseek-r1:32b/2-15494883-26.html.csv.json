    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"none of the airport on the list have seen a decrease in use\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part means.\n\nThe claim says that none of the airports listed have experienced a decrease in their passenger numbers. So, I should look at each row and check if any of them have a negative annual change percentage because that would indicate a decrease.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: S\u00e3o Paulo with 12.8% increase.\nRow 2: Another S\u00e3o Paulo entry with 11.7% increase.\nRow 3: Bras\u00edlia has a huge jump of 45.1%, so that's up.\nRow 4: Rio de Janeiro at 30.4% increase.\nRow 5: Another Rio airport, 9.2% up.\nRow 6: Salvador with 20% growth.\nRow 7: Porto Alegre increased by 11.6%.\nRow 8: Belo Horizonte's annual change is 7.5%, still positive.\nRow 9: Recife went up by 16.1%.\nRow 10: Curitiba has a 13% increase.\nRow 11: Fortaleza saw a 24% rise, which is significant.\nRow 12: Florian\u00f3polis with 7.8%, still positive.\nRow 13: Manaus increased by 10.3%.\nRow 14: Bel\u00e9m's annual change is 13.5%, up again.\nRow 15: Vit\u00f3ria has a 6.1% increase.\n\nWait, let me double-check each one to make sure I didn't miss anything. All the annual changes are positive percentages, meaning every airport listed had an increase in passengers over the year. There's no negative number anywhere in the 'annual change' column. \n\nSo since all of them have a positive or increasing trend, it means none have decreased. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that no airport on the list has seen a decrease in use. By examining each row, I observe that every annual change percentage is positive, indicating an increase in passengers for all listed airports.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states that \"the Vit\u00f3ria airport be the most crowded airport, run at 222.5% capacity.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find the row for Vit\u00f3ria. Scanning down, I see that Row 15 lists Vit\u00f3ria with a capacity in use of 222.5%. That matches exactly what the claim says about the percentage.\n\nNext, the claim refers to it being \"the most crowded airport.\" To verify this, I need to check the 'capacity in use' column across all rows and see if 222.5% is indeed the highest value there.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. S\u00e3o Paulo: 113.4%\n2. S\u00e3o Paulo: 78.4%\n3. Bras\u00edlia: 134.1%\n4. Rio de Janeiro: 40.2%\n5. Rio de Janeiro: 152.7%\n6. Salvador: 69.1%\n7. Porto Alegre: 52.7%\n8. Belo Horizonte: 213.0% \u2192 Wait, this is higher than Vit\u00f3ria's 222.5%? No, wait, actually 213.0% is less than 222.5%. So Vit\u00f3ria is still higher.\n9. Recife: 63.5%\n10.

Vit\u00f3ria: 222.5%\n\nWait, actually, looking again at row 8: Belo Horizonte has a capacity in use of 213.0%, which is less than 222.5%. So yes, Vit\u00f3ria's 222.5% is the highest among all listed.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are accurate: Vit\u00f3ria airport runs at 222.5% capacity and it's the most crowded based on that metric.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately reflects the data in the table, with Vit\u00f3ria having the highest capacity usage.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"capacity in use\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the problem step by step. The task is to determine whether a given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"s\u00e3o paulo and rio de janeiro be the only location to have 2 airport, and both of them have 1 run under capacity and 1 running over.\" \n\nFirst, I'll parse the table provided in naturalized format. Each row represents an entry with columns: rank, location, total passengers, annual change, and capacity in use. There are 15 rows, each corresponding to different locations in Brazil.\n\nThe claim has two main parts:\n1. S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are the only locations with two airports.\n2. Both of these cities have one airport operating under capacity and another over capacity.\n\nTo verify the first part, I'll check how many entries there are for each location. Looking through the rows:\n\n- S\u00e3o Paulo appears in Row 1 and Row 2 (rank 1 and rank 2).\n- Rio de Janeiro is listed in Row 4 and Row 5.\n- Other locations like Bras\u00edlia, Salvador, Porto Alegre, etc., each have only one entry.\n\nSo, it's clear that both S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro have two airports each, while all others have only one. This part of the claim holds true.\n\nNext, I'll examine whether each of these cities has one airport under capacity and another over capacity. The \"capacity in use\" column indicates if an airport is operating above or below its capacity. A value over 100% means it's running over capacity, while below 100% is under.\n\nFor S\u00e3o Paulo:\n- Row 1: Capacity in use is 113.4% (over capacity).\n- Row 2: Capacity in use is 78.4% (under capacity).\n\nSo, S\u00e3o Paulo has one airport over and one under.\n\nFor Rio de Janeiro:\n- Row 4: Capacity in use is 40.2% (under capacity).\n- Row 5: Capacity in use is 152.7% (over capacity).\n\nAgain, Rio de Janeiro also has one airport under and another over.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are satisfied.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the most over capacity airport , vit\u00f3ria , be also the airport that have see the least annual growth\". So I'll break this down into two parts and check each against the table.\n\nFirst part: Identify which airport is the most over capacity. Looking at the column \"capacity in use\", higher percentages mean more over capacity. Scanning through the rows, Vit\u00f3ria is on row 15 with a capacity in use of 222.5%. That's clearly the highest among all the listed airports. So, yes, Vit\u00f3ria is the most over capacity.\n\nSecond part: Determine if this airport has seen the least annual growth. The \"annual change\" column shows the percentage growth each airport had. For Vit\u00f3ria, it's 6.1%, which I need to compare with others. Let me check all annual changes:\n\nRow 3: 45.1% (highest), Row 4:30.4%, Row 5:9.2%, Row6:20%, Row7:11.6%, Row8:7.5%, Row9:16.1%, Row10:13%, Row11:24%, Row12:7.8%, Row13:10.3%, Row14:13.5%, Row15:6.1%.\n\nSo the annual changes range from 6.1% up to 45.1%. Vit\u00f3ria's 6.1% is indeed the lowest, meaning it has seen the least growth. Therefore, both parts of the claim are accurate.\n\nNow, I'll list the relevant cells:\n\n- For capacity in use (most over capacity): row 15.\n- For annual change (least growth): also row 15.\n\nSo both pieces of information come from row 15.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"capacity in use\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"s\u00e3o paulo and rio de janeiro be the only location to see more than 10000000 passenger pass through their airport.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this claim carefully. It says that S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are the only locations where the number of passengers exceeds 10,000,000 per year at their airports.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are two rows for S\u00e3o Paulo and two for Rio de Janeiro because each is mentioned twice in different ranks. So, I'll need to check all these entries.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Location S\u00e3o Paulo with 13,611,227 passengers.\nRow 2: Also S\u00e3o Paulo with 12,940,193.\nBoth of these are above 10 million. So, that part checks out.\n\nNow for Rio de Janeiro:\nRow 4: Rio has 6,024,930 passengers.\nRow 5: Another entry for Rio with 4,887,306.\nWait a minute, both of these are below 10 million. That means neither of Rio's entries meet the claim's threshold.\n\nSo, according to this, only S\u00e3o Paulo has airports handling over 10 million passengers, not Rio de Janeiro as stated in the claim. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because Rio's numbers don't exceed 10 million. Also, there might be other cities with higher than 10 million? Let me check all rows just to make sure.\n\nLooking at all rows:\n- S\u00e3o Paulo: Rows 1 and 2 both above 10M.\n- Bras\u00edlia has 9,926,786 \u2013 below 10M.\n- Rio de Janeiro's entries as discussed are below.\n- Salvador: 4,145,371; Porto Alegre: 3,215,545; Belo Horizonte: 3,194,715; Recife: 3,173,672; Curitiba: 2,840,349; Fortaleza: 2,317,869; Florian\u00f3polis: 1,382,577; Manaus: 1,368,968; Bel\u00e9m: 1,330,965; Vit\u00f3ria: 1,246,222.\n\nNone of the other locations exceed 10 million except for S\u00e3o Paulo. So, the claim incorrectly includes Rio de Janeiro and doesn't recognize that there are no others besides S\u00e3o Paulo above 10M. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because only S\u00e3o Paulo's airports have more than 10 million passengers, not Rio de Janeiro.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total passengers\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total passengers\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total passengers\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total passengers\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"the recife airport be the most crowded airport, run at 81.2% capacity.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check what defines a crowded airport in this table. It probably refers to how much of their capacity they're using, which is given by the 'capacity in use' column. So higher numbers there mean more crowded.\n\nLooking through each row for Recife: I see that Recife is listed at row 9. Its capacity in use is 63.5%, and annual change is 16.1%. \n\nWait, but the claim mentions 81.2% capacity. Let me check all rows to find where 81.2% appears. Scanning through each 'capacity in use' value: Row 10 has Curitiba at 81.2%, which matches the percentage in the claim. \n\nSo, according to this, the airport running at 81.2% is Curitiba, not Recife. Recife's capacity usage is actually lower at 63.5%. Therefore, the claim incorrectly attributes Curitiba's data to Recife.\n\nAlso, checking if any airport in Recife has higher capacity use than others: The highest I see for Recife is 63.5%, while other cities like Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre have higher percentages. So Recife isn't even the most crowded based on their own data.\n\nHence, both parts of the claim are wrong: it's not Recife running at 81.2%, but Curitiba is.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Recife has an 81.2% capacity and is the most crowded.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"all of the airport on the list have seen a decrease in use\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part means.\n\nThe table has 15 rows, each representing an airport with details like rank, location, total passengers, annual change, and capacity in use. The claim says that all airports have had a decrease in use. I think \"use\" here refers to either the number of passengers or maybe something else, but since the annual change column is about percentages, probably it's referring to whether each airport's passenger count has decreased.\n\nSo, for the claim to be TRUE, every single airport should show a negative percentage in the annual change. Let me check each row one by one.\n\nLooking at Row 1: S\u00e3o Paulo with an annual change of 12.8%. That's positive, so it's an increase. Already this means not all have decreased. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"use.\" Maybe they're referring to capacity in use? Let me think again.\n\nWait, the claim says a decrease in use. If \"use\" is about how much of their capacity is being used, then perhaps looking at 'capacity in use' makes sense. So, if all capacities are decreasing, but I see that some have high percentages like 213% in Row 8 (Belo Horizonte). But the annual change for Belo Horizonte is 7.5%, which is an increase. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait no, the claim says \"a decrease in use.\" So if 'annual change' refers to the percentage change in passengers, then a positive number means more passengers (increase), negative would mean decrease. The claim states that all have seen a decrease, so they should all have negative annual changes.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: S\u00e3o Paulo - 12.8% increase.\nRow 2: S\u00e3o Paulo again - 11.7% increase.\nRow 3: Bras\u00edlia - 45.1% increase.\nRow 4: Rio de Janeiro - 30.4% increase.\nRow 5: Another Rio airport - 9.2% increase.\nRow 6: Salvador - 20% increase.\nRow 7: Porto Alegre - 11.6% increase.\nRow 8: Belo Horizonte - 7.5% increase.\nRow 9: Recife - 16.1% increase.\nRow 10: Curitiba - 13% increase.\nRow 11: Fortaleza - 24% increase.\nRow 12: Florian\u00f3polis - 7.8% increase.\nRow 13: Manaus - 10.3% increase.\nRow 14: Bel\u00e9m - 13.5% increase.\nRow 15: Vit\u00f3ria - 6.1% increase.\n\nWait, I didn't see any negative percentages in the annual change column. All are positive, meaning all airports have seen an increase in passengers. So the claim that \"all...have seen a decrease in use\" is definitely FALSE because they've actually increased.\n\nSo the relevant cells are the 'annual change' for each row, as that's where we can see whether there was an increase or decrease.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because all airports showed an increase in passengers, not a decrease.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table with several rows of data about different locations and their airports, including metrics like rank, total passengers, annual change, and capacity in use. The claim is: \"manaus and rio de janeiro be the only location to have 2 airport , and both of them be run over capacity.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is saying. It seems there are two main points here:\n\n1. **Only Manaus and Rio de Janeiro have two airports each.**\n2. **Both of these locations are operating over their capacity.**\n\nTo verify this, I'll check the table for each location mentioned.\n\n**Checking for Two Airports:**\n- The table lists multiple rows, but some locations appear more than once because they have multiple airports.\n- Let's look through the 'location' column:\n  - S\u00e3o Paulo appears twice (Rows 1 and 2).\n  - Rio de Janeiro also appears twice (Rows 4 and 5).\n  - Manaus appears only once (Row 13).\n  \nWait, this is conflicting with the claim. The claim says both Manaus and Rio de Janeiro have two airports each, but in the table, only Rio de Janeiro has two entries. Manaus is listed once. So, according to the table, Manaus doesn't have a second airport entry.\n\n**Checking Over Capacity:**\n- 'Capacity in use' being over 100% indicates that an airport is operating over its capacity.\n- For Manaus (Row 13): Capacity in use is 75.4%, which is below 100%. So, it's not over capacity.\n- Rio de Janeiro has two entries:\n  - Row 4: 40.2% (not over)\n  - Row 5: 152.7% (over capacity)\n\nSo, only one of Rio's airports is over capacity, but Manaus isn't.\n\n**Evaluating the Claim:**\nThe claim says both Manaus and Rio have two airports each, and both are over capacity. However:\n- Only Rio de Janeiro has two entries; Manaus doesn't.\n- Neither airport in Manaus is over capacity, and only one of Rio's is.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by the data. The answer should be FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\nI'll list the cells that support this conclusion:\n- For Manaus, check its capacity (Row 13).\n- For Rio de Janeiro, both rows to see their capacities.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_5\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_13\": \"capacity in use\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut following the correct JSON structure as per the example:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"capacity in use\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"capacity in use\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the most under capacity airport , vit\u00f3ria , be also the airport that have see the most annual growth",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the most under capacity airport, vit\u00f3ria, be also the airport that have see the most annual growth.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what each part of the claim means. The first part refers to the \"most under capacity\" airport, which is Vit\u00f3ria. Under capacity usually means that the airport isn't operating at full capacity; in other words, it has a lower percentage of capacity in use. So I need to find which airport has the lowest value in the \"capacity in use\" column.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"capacity in use\" value. Let's scan through them:\n\nRow 1: S\u00e3o Paulo with 113.4%\nRow 2: Another S\u00e3o Paulo with 78.4%\nRow 3: Bras\u00edlia with 134.1%\nRow 4: Rio de Janeiro with 40.2%\nRow 5: Rio de Janeiro again with 152.7%\nRow 6: Salvador with 69.1%\nRow 7: Porto Alegre with 52.7%\nRow 8: Belo Horizonte with 213.0% \u2013 that's over capacity.\nRow 9: Recife with 63.5%\nRow 10: Curitiba with 81.2%\nRow 11: Fortaleza with 77.3%\nRow 12: Florian\u00f3polis with 125.7%\nRow 13: Manaus with 75.4%\nRow 14: Bel\u00e9m with 49.3%\nRow 15: Vit\u00f3ria with 222.5%\n\nWait, hold on, the claim says that Vit\u00f3ria is the most under capacity, but looking at its \"capacity in use\" it's 222.5%, which is actually over capacity. That seems contradictory because being over capacity would mean they are using more than their available capacity, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait no, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The claim says the most under capacity airport is Vit\u00f3ria, but in the table, Vit\u00f3ria has 222.5%, which is higher than 100%, meaning it's over capacity. So that contradicts the claim because if an airport is over capacity (using more than 100%), it's not under capacity. That would suggest that the first part of the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"under capacity.\" Usually, under capacity means that they are using less than their total available capacity, so a percentage below 100%. So looking for the airport with the lowest capacity in use, which would be the most under capacity. Let's find the smallest value in \"capacity in use.\"\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nRow 4: Rio de Janeiro has 40.2% \u2013 that's the lowest.\nThen Row 7: Porto Alegre with 52.7%, then Recife at 63.5%, Bel\u00e9m at 49.3%.\n\nWait, so Row 14 is Bel\u00e9m with 49.3%, which is even lower than Rio de Janeiro's 40.2%. Wait no: 40.2% is less than 49.3%. So the most under capacity airport is actually Rio de Janeiro in row 4 with 40.2%. But according to the claim, it's Vit\u00f3ria.\n\nSo that part of the claim is incorrect because Vit\u00f3ria is at 222.5%, which is over capacity. Therefore, the first condition of the claim is false, making the entire claim false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread the rows. Let me check again.\n\nRow 15: location: vit\u00f3ria, capacity in use: 222.5% \u2013 yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the most under capacity airport would have the smallest \"capacity in use\" value. The smallest is Row 4 with 40.2%, which is Rio de Janeiro. Therefore, the claim incorrectly states that Vit\u00f3ria is the most under capacity when it's actually over capacity. Hence, the first part of the claim is false.\n\nNow, even if we were to check the second part about annual growth, but since the first condition is already incorrect, the entire claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting \"most under capacity.\" Maybe it refers to having the most available capacity left, which would be calculated as 100% minus the percentage used. So for example, an airport with 40.2% in use has 59.8% unused capacity, while Vit\u00f3ria at 222.5% is over by 122.5%, so it's not under.\n\nTherefore, the claim's first assertion is wrong because Vit\u00f3ria isn't the most under capacity; instead, it's over capacity.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Vit\u00f3ria is both the most under capacity and has the highest annual growth. However, Vit\u00f3ria's \"capacity in use\" is 222.5%, indicating it's over capacity, not under. The most under capacity airport is Rio de Janeiro at 40.2%. Thus, the first part of the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": {\n    \"status\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"explanation\": \"Vit\u00f3ria's 'capacity in use' is 222.5%, indicating it is over capacity, not under. The most under capacity airport is Rio de Janeiro with 40.2%.\"\n  }\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided.\n\nThe claim says: \"Salvador and Rio de Janeiro be the only location to see more than 20,000,000 passengers pass through their airport.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It claims that Salvador and Rio de Janeiro are the only two locations where airports have handled over 20 million passengers annually.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different location with its total passengers. The \"total passengers\" column will be crucial here because it shows how many passengers each airport has served.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to check which locations have total passengers exceeding 20,000,000.\n\nRow 1: S\u00e3o Paulo - 13,611,227 passengers. That's about 13.6 million, so less than 20 million.\nRow 2: Another entry for S\u00e3o Paulo with 12,940,193 passengers. Again, below 20 million.\nRow 3: Bras\u00edlia has 9,926,786 passengers. That's about 9.9 million, also less than 20 million.\nRow 4: Rio de Janeiro with 6,024,930 passengers. Wait, that's only around 6 million. Hmm, but the claim mentions Rio having over 20 million? That doesn't add up. Maybe I'm missing something.\nWait, let me check again. Row 5 is also Rio de Janeiro with 4,887,306 passengers. That's even less, about 4.9 million. So neither of the Rio rows exceed 20 million.\n\nRow 6: Salvador has 4,145,371 passengers. That's around 4.1 million, which is still below 20 million.\nRows 7 to 15 are all under 20 million as well. The highest I see is S\u00e3o Paulo with about 13.6 million in the first row.\n\nWait a second, maybe I misread something. Let me double-check each row:\n\nRow 1: S\u00e3o Paulo - 13,611,227\nRow 2: S\u00e3o Paulo - 12,940,193\nRow 3: Bras\u00edlia - 9,926,786\nRow 4: Rio de Janeiro - 6,024,930\nRow 5: Rio de Janeiro - 4,887,306\nRow 6: Salvador - 4,145,371\n\nNone of these are over 20 million. So according to the table, no location has more than 20 million passengers. The claim says Salvador and Rio are the only ones above 20 million, but in reality, they're both below that threshold.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because neither Salvador nor Rio de Janeiro have passenger counts exceeding 20 million. In fact, all locations listed have less than 14 million passengers at most.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE as no location has over 20 million passengers; Salvador and Rio are both below that number.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total passengers\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total passengers\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
