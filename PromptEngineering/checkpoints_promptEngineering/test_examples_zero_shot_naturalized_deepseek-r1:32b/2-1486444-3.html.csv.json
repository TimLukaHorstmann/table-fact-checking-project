    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says: \"at the shooto 2003 event on march 18th in tokyo , japan , he battle with fighter rumina sato\".\n\nFirst, let me break down the components of this claim:\n\n1. Event name: shooto 2003\n2. Date: March 18th\n3. Location: Tokyo, Japan\n4. Fighter involved: rumina sato\n\nI need to check each of these against the table to see if they match.\n\nLooking at the table rows, I'll go through them one by one, focusing on events named \"shooto 2003\" and looking for any mentions of Rumina Sato as an opponent.\n\nStarting from Row 29: It says \"event: shooto 2003: 3 / 18\". The event name is \"shooto 2003\", which matches the claim. The date listed here is 3/18, which I assume is March 18th since the month isn't specified beyond the number. So that's a match for the date and event name.\n\nLooking at Row 29 again: Opponent is Rumina Sato, method was TKO via punches, location is Tokyo, Japan. Wait, no\u2014location in the table says \"tokyo\" but the location column specifically mentions \"japan\", so it's consistent with the claim of being in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nSo the event on March 18th (Row 29) involves fighting Rumina Sato at a shooto 2003 event in Tokyo, Japan. That matches all parts of the claim: event name, date (March 18th), location (Tokyo, Japan), and opponent (Rumina Sato).\n\nTherefore, all elements of the claim are supported by Row 29 in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the data in the table. The relevant cells include the event details, date, opponent, and location from Row 29.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_28\", \"date\": \"3 / 18\"}, // Note: Correcting the example to match the actual row index and data structure\n     {\"row_29\", \"opponent\": \"rumina sato\"},\n     {\"row_29\", \"location\": \"tokyo, japan\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nWait, I think there was a mistake in how I structured the JSON. The correct approach should list each relevant cell with its row index and column name.\n\nThe correct JSON response based on Row 29 would be:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut since the user provided Row 29 as the correct row in their thought process, I should adjust accordingly.\n\nActually, correcting myself:\n\nThe claim refers to March 18th at shooto 2003 in Tokyo. From the table, Row 28 is \"shooto 2003: 8 / 10\" and Row 29 is \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\". So the correct row is 29.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\n- event (Row 29)\n- date (Row 29)\n- opponent (Row 29)\n- location (Row 29)\n\nBut in the initial thought process, I might have miscounted rows. To be accurate, Row 29 is \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\", so it's correct.\n\nFinal JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"event\"}, // shooto 2003: 8/10\n     {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}, // rumina sato\n     {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"location\"} // tokyo, japan\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nWait no, the correct row for March 18th is Row 29.\n\nSo correcting:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut perhaps the exact event in Row 29 is shooto 2003: 3 / 18. So:\n\n- Column \"event\" in Row 29: \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\"\n- Column \"date\": \"3 / 18\"\n- Column \"opponent\": \"rumina sato\"\n- Column \"location\": \"tokyo, japan\"\n\nThus, the JSON should list these four cells from Row 29.\n\nHowever, in the table provided earlier, Row 28 is:\n\n\"shooto 2003: 8 / 10\" and Row 29 is \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\". So the correct row for March 18th is 29.\n\nThus, the final JSON would correctly reference Row 29 for all these details.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_ cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to verify the claim: \"at dream 11, his fight with shinya aoki go to 4:56\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look through each row in the table provided and check if there's any mention of \"dream 11\" or a fight involving Shinya Aoki. The claim is about a specific event at Dream 11 where his fight went to 4:56, which I assume refers to the time duration.\n\nLooking through the rows one by one:\n\nRow 0: Event is \"fire fight 3\", opponent Marcus Peltonen. Not relevant.\nRow 1: Event is \"fire fight 4\", opponent Jani Lax. Still not related.\n...\nContinuing down, row 26 mentions \"Shooto Finland: Capital Punishment 2\" against Metin Yakut. No match here.\n\nWait, looking at the rows, I see that in Row 18, the event is \"dream 11\", but the opponent there is Shinya Aoki? Let me check. Oh wait no, in row 26 it's Shooto Finland... Wait, maybe I'm miscounting rows. Let me recount carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go through each row again more carefully.\n\nRow 0: fire fight 3\nRow 1: fire fight 4\n...\nI see that Row 26 is \"Shooto Finland...\" and Row 25 is \"Shooto 2004...\". Hmm, maybe I need to look for any event named \"dream 11\".\n\nWait, in the table provided, looking at all rows from 0 to 35, I don't see any row where the Event column is \"dream 11\" or a similar event. The closest is Row 26 and others but not specifically Dream 11.\n\nAlso, checking for fights against Shinya Aoki: looking through each opponent's name. In Row 26, the opponent is Metin Yakut; in Row 25, Gesias Cavalcante. I don't see any row where the opponent is Shinya Aoki. So there's no fight with him mentioned.\n\nMoreover, regarding the time \"4:56\", none of the rows show a Time that matches this exactly. The times vary from 1:38 to 9:25 and others, but not 4:56.\n\nTherefore, since there is no row in the table mentioning an event called \"dream 11\" or a fight against Shinya Aoki with a time of 4:56, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a specific event at Dream 11 where a fight went to 4:56. However, reviewing all rows in the table, there is no mention of \"dream 11\" or a fight involving Shinya Aoki with that time duration. Therefore, the claim is not supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to verify a claim about a specific fight outcome using the provided table data. The claim is: \"his fight at pride bushido 10 end via ko with a knee strike.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is asserting and then check if it aligns with the information in the table.\n\nBreaking down the claim:\n- The event name is \"pride bushido 10.\"\n- The outcome (result) was a KO.\n- The method used was a knee strike.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row of the table to find any mention of \"Pride Bushido 10.\" Scanning through rows 1 to 35, looking at the 'event' column. \n\nI notice that in row 24 (assuming counting starts from 0 or as per how it's indexed), there's a mention of \"pride bushido 10\" under the event. Let me check what other details are provided for this row. The method is listed as KO, and the description mentions ending with a knee strike.\n\nWait, actually looking at the table data provided by the user, I should map each cell correctly. Each row in the table has columns: res (result), record, opponent, method, event, round, time, location.\n\nLooking back, for example, Row 24:\n- Event: \"pride bushido 10\"\n- Method: KO\n- Description says it ended with a knee strike.\n\nSo yes, this matches the claim. The fight at Pride Bushido 10 resulted in a KO via a knee strike. Therefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the data in row 24.\n\nI should ensure there's no other instance of \"Pride Bushido 10\" elsewhere to confirm uniqueness, but from the given rows, it seems only this one occurrence exists.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_25\": 24, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nWait, I need to correct the row indices and ensure accurate cell references. Upon rechecking, in the table provided by the user, each entry starts from Row 0 as per their list.\n\nLooking again, the relevant event is listed under 'event' for a particular fight. Let me recount:\n\nUpon closer inspection, the event \"pride bushido 10\" appears in row 24 (assuming rows are zero-indexed). The method was KO, and the description mentions ending via knee strike.\n\nBut actually, in the table provided by the user, let's list out each relevant cell accurately. Each fight entry has an 'event' column where \"Pride Bushido 10\" is listed in row 24 (if starting from 0), along with method and result.\n\nThus, the correct cells are:\n\n- Row 24, event: pride bushido 10\n- Row 24, method: KO\n- Row 24, description: ended via knee strike\n\nSo the JSON should reflect these cells. The relevant_ cells would include 'event', 'method', and possibly others to fully support the claim.\n\nBut looking back at the table structure, each fight has columns for res (result), record, opponent, method, event, round, time, location.\n\nIn row 24:\n\n- event: pride bushido 10\n- method: KO\n- description in 'method' might mention knee strike, but in the provided data, perhaps the exact method is just KO without specifying the knee. Alternatively, if in another column like 'notes' or similar, but based on the user's table structure as shown, it's likely that 'method' specifies KO via a knee.\n\nWait, in the original data, each row has columns separated by commas, so perhaps under 'method', it says \"KO (knee)\" or similar. Assuming that, then:\n\nRelevant cells are:\n- event: pride bushido 10\n- method: KO with a knee strike\n\nSo for JSON, referencing row index and column names.\n\nThe table is structured as follows:\n\nColumns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time, location.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be 'event' to confirm the fight took place at Pride Bushido 10, and 'method' to confirm it ended via KO with a knee strike.\n\nThus, the JSON should list these two cells:\n\n{\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n{\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n\nHence, the correct answer is TRUE, supported by these two cells.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's break this down step by step. The user is asking whether the claim \"round 3 be at 3:50\" is true or false based on the provided data table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim means. It seems to suggest that in round 3 of some event, the time was 3 minutes and 50 seconds (3:50). So I'm looking for a row where the 'round' is 3 and the 'time' column has 3:50.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match or event with details like opponent, method, round, time, etc. I need to scan through each row to find any instance where the round is 3 and the time matches 3:50.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- Row 26 mentions \"round 3\" in the 'column_name' as \"round_3\". The 'time' for this row is listed as 3:50. That's a direct match. So this supports the claim.\n\nI should check if there are any other rows with round 3 to ensure consistency, but from the provided data, only Row 26 has round 3 and the corresponding time of 3:50.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to verify this claim: \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18 be the event in turku , finland and have an opponent of rumina sato.\" Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two main points: the event is \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\" held in Turku, Finland, and the opponent was Rumina Sato. I'll check each part step by step.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to find a row where the Event column matches \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\". Let me scan through the rows. \n\nRow 29 mentions the event as \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\" and it took place in Tokyo, Japan. The opponent here is Rumina Sato. Wait a minute, the location in this row is Tokyo, not Turku, Finland. That seems contradictory.\n\nBut wait, let me check other rows to be thorough. Let's look for any event named \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\". Scanning through, I see that only Row 29 lists this exact event name. The location is Tokyo, Japan, and the opponent is indeed Rumina Sato.\n\nHowever, the claim says the event was in Turku, Finland. That doesn't match with what's in Row 29. So there might be a mistake here because the location specified in the claim isn't matching any entry. Let me check if there are other events related to Turku, Finland.\n\nLooking through the table again, I see that some events took place in Turku, Finland, but those are different events. For example, Row 31 mentions \"shooto Finland: the first time\" in Turku, Finland, with an opponent of Sami Hyyppa. But this isn't the event claimed.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The event \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\" is listed in Row 29, but it's in Tokyo, Japan, not Turku, Finland. Therefore, the claim that it was held in Turku is incorrect. Additionally, while the opponent Rumina Sato is correct for that event, the location isn't.\n\nSo, since part of the claim (the location) doesn't match, the entire statement isn't fully supported by the data. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\" took place in Turku, Finland, with Rumina Sato as the opponent.

The user has provided a table with multiple rows of data and a specific claim: \"pride bushido 10 never have ko (knee) method.\" My task is to verify the truthfulness of this claim based on the given data.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The event in question is \"Pride Bushido 10,\" and the claim states that this event does not have a KO (Knee) method as one of its fight outcomes. So, my goal is to check if any fights at \"Pride Bushido 10\" ended with a KO via knee strike.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different match or fight event. Each row has details such as the fighter's record, opponent, method of victory, event name, and other specifics like round and time.\n\nTo verify the claim, I'll need to scan through all rows where the event is \"Pride Bushido 10\" and check if any of these fights ended with a KO (Knee) method.

Let me list all events to identify where \"Pride Bushido 10\" appears.\n\nAfter reviewing each row, it seems that \"Pride Bushido 10\" isn't listed in any of the provided rows. Therefore, there are no entries for this event in the given table.\n\nSince there's no data for \"Pride Bushido 10,\" we can infer that either the event wasn't part of the dataset or it didn't occur. However, according to the claim, we need to check if any fight at this event used a KO (knee) method.\n\nGiven that there are no relevant entries in the table for \"Pride Bushido 10,\" the claim can be considered TRUE because there's no evidence of such an outcome in the dataset. Alternatively, without data supporting the existence of the event, we might consider it as not having any KO (knee) methods since there's nothing to contradict.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed some rows. Let me double-check:\n\nRow 23: \"Shooto 2004: 7 / 16\" \u2013 no.\nRow 24: \"Shooto Finland: Capital Punishment 2\" \u2013 no.\n...\nI think it's clear that \"Pride Bushido 10\" isn't present in the table. Therefore, there are no relevant cells to check, and the claim holds as TRUE.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought Row 33 was part of the event, but upon checking, it doesn't specify the event correctly. So yes, \"Pride Bushido 10\" isn't in any row, so no fights there used KO (knee) method based on this data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
