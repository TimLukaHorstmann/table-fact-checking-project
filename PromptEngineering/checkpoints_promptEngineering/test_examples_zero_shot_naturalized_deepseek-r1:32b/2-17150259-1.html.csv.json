    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"the friendly competition on 26 may 1999 take place at lugo , emilia - romagna\". \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components. It mentions a friendly competition on May 26, 1999, and the venue was Lugo in Emilia-Romagna. So I need to check if there's a row in the table where the date is 26 May 1999, the competition type is friendly, and the venue is Lugo, Emilia-Romagna.\n\nLooking at the table rows one by one:\n\nRow 1: Date is 25 September 1993. Not relevant.\nRow 2: Date is 6 November 1993. Not relevant.\nRow 3: Date is 13 March 1994. No.\nRow 4: 17 April 1994. No.\nRow 5: 8 June 1995. Competition is World Cup, not friendly.\nRow 6: 19 November 1995. UEFA qual, not friendly.\nRow 7: 23 May 1998. World Cup qual. Not the date or competition type.\nRow 8: 13 September 1998. World Cup qual. No.\nRow 9: 11 October 1998. World Cup qual. No.\nRow 10: Date is 26 May 1999. Let's check this row.\n\nRow 10 details:\n- Goal: 17\n- Date: 26 May 1999\n- Venue: Lugo, Emilia-Romagna\n- Result: 1 - 4\n- Competition: Friendly\n- Scored: 1\n\nThis matches the claim exactly. The date is correct, the venue is Lugo in Emilia-Romagna, and the competition is friendly. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to list the relevant cells. For Row 10, we're checking four columns: date, venue, competition, and scored (though scored isn't part of the claim, but it's good to confirm the data). However, strictly for the claim, we only need the date, venue, and competition.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- row_index: 9 (since rows start at 0), column_name: \"date\"\n- row_index: 9, column_name: \"venue\"\n- row_index: 9, column_name: \"competition\"\n\nWait, in the table provided, Row 10 is actually index 9 because counting starts from 0. So yes, that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly references Row 10 of the table (index 9), which shows a friendly competition on May 26, 1999, at Lugo in Emilia-Romagna.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's break this down step by step. I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"lugo , emilia - romagna be the venue when the competition be friendly on 26 may 1999 and the result be 2 - 4.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find any entries that match the date mentioned in the claim, which is 26 May 1999. Scanning the rows, I see that Row 10 has a date of \"26 may 1999.\" That's a direct match.\n\nNext, I'll check the venue for this row. The venue listed in Row 10 is \"lugo , emilia - romagna,\" which exactly matches the claim. So far, so good.\n\nNow, looking at the competition column for Row 10, it says \"friendly.\" That's consistent with the claim as well. The competition type mentioned in the claim is friendly on that date, and here we have a friendly match on 26 May 1999.\n\nFinally, I need to verify the result. The claim states the result was \"2 - 4,\" but according to Row 10, the result is listed as \"1 - 4.\" There's a discrepancy here\u2014the first number in the score doesn't match. The claim says 2 goals for one team and 4 for the other, while the table shows 1 goal for the home team and 4 for the away team.\n\nSince the result in the table (1-4) does not match the claimed result (2-4), even though the venue, date, and competition type are correct, the claim is not fully supported by the data. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
