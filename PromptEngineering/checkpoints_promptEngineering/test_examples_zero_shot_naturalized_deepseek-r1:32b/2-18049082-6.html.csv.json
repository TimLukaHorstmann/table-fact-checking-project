    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"justin rose be from the united state\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The rows are numbered from 1 to 13, and each row has details about a player including their place, name, country, score, and to par. My goal is to find out where Justin Rose is from.\n\nLooking through the rows, I spot Justin Rose in Row 5. Let me verify that: yes, Row 5 says \"player: justin rose (a)\" and under the country column, it's listed as england. So according to this data, Justin Rose is from England, not the United States.\n\nThe claim states that he's from the US, but the table contradicts that. Therefore, the claim must be FALSE. \n\nTo support my conclusion, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant. The key information here is the player's name and his country. So, for Row 5, both the \"player\" and \"country\" columns are important.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE with the relevant cells being row_index 4 (since indexing starts at 0) for the player column and row_index 4 for the country column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is about Justin Rose's nationality. Checking Row 5 shows his country as England, not the United States. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"danish thomas bj\u00f8rn rank lower than tiger wood\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify Thomas Bj\u00f8rn and Tiger Woods in the table. Looking at the rows:\n\n- Row 6: place t6, player thomas bjarn, country denmark\n- Row 9: place t6, player tiger woods, country united states\n\nWait, but the claim mentions \"danish thomas bj\u00f8rn,\" which matches Thomas Bjarn in row 6. His country is Denmark, so that's correct.\n\nNow, both Thomas Bj\u00f8rn and Tiger Woods are listed with a place of t6. The 't' probably stands for tied at that position. So, they're both in the same tie position, which is 6th place each.\n\nThe claim says that Thomas Bj\u00f8rn's rank is lower than Tiger Wood's. Lower rank would mean a worse position, like higher number, because in golf lower scores are better. But since both are t6, their ranks are equal, not one being lower than the other.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because they have the same rank, so Bj\u00f8rn isn't ranked lower; he's tied with Tiger Woods.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are Thomas Bj\u00f8rn's and Tiger Woods' place positions. Both are in t6, indicating they're tied, so Bj\u00f8rn isn't lower.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
