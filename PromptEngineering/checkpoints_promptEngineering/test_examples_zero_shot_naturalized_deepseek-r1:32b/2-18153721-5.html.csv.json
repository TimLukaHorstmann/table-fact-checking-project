The 'place' column seems crucial here because it indicates the player's position or tie in the rankings.\n\nThe claim mentions that there are 7 players tied for 6th place. So I need to check how many players have a place marked as 't6'. \n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Rows 1 and 2: Both have place t1, so they're tied for first.\n- Rows 3,4,5: These are all t3, meaning tied for third.\n- Rows 6 through 12: Each of these has place t6.

The table has rows from 1 to 12, each representing a different player's performance in some competition, probably a golf tournament since it mentions scores and 'to par' which are common in golf.\n\nThe claim says two players tied for the lead with a score that's 2 under par. Let me break this down into parts:\n\n1. **Tied for the lead**: This means both players should be in the same position (same place) at the top of the standings.\n2. **Score 2 under par**: The 'to par' column should show '-2' because being under par is represented by a negative number.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: David Graham, Australia, score 68 +71=139, to par -1\n- Row 2: Sandy Lyle, Scotland, same as above\n\nSo both are tied for t1 (tied first place) with a total score of 139 and 'to par' is -1. Wait, that's only 1 under par, not 2.\n\nLet me check the other rows to see if any others have higher positions or better scores:\n\n- Rows 3-5 are t3 with 'to par' e (even), which is worse than -1.\n- Rows 6-12 are t6 with +1, which is even worse.\n\nSo only rows 1 and 2 are in the lead with to par -1. But the claim says \"2 under par\", so that's not matching. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because while two players tied for the lead, their score was only 1 under par, not 2.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\n- For both Row 1 and Row 2, we need to check 'place' (to confirm they are tied first) and 'to par' (to see if it's -2). But since their to par is -1, that's why the claim is false. So I'll include those relevant cells.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\nRow 0: place = t1 and to_par = '-1'\nRow 1: place = t1 and to_par = '-1'\n\nBut wait, in the example, row indices start from 0, so Row 1 is index 0? No, actually, looking back, the user provided the table with rows labeled 1-12. But when converting to JSON, indexes are zero-based. So:\n\nRow 1: t1, David Graham... which would be index 0\nRow 2: t1, Sandy Lyle... index 1\n\nSo relevant cells are columns 'place' and 'to_par' for rows 0 and 1 (since in programming, we often start from 0).\n\nWait, but in the table description, it's row 1 to row 12. So when translating to a JSON array, each row is an object at index 0-11.\n\nSo, for the first two rows:\n\nRow 1: t1 (index 0)\nRow 2: t1 (index 1)\n\nThus, their 'place' and 'to_par' are relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there's a tie for the lead with a score of 2 under par. Checking the table, both David Graham and Sandy Lyle are tied for first place but their scores are only 1 under par. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
