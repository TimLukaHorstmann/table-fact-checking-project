Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 5: Place t5, Player Bob Gilder\n- Row 6: Place t5, Player Steven Richardson\n\nThe 't5' notation suggests that both are tied for fifth place.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"kenny knox receive a higher number score than john huston\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that Kenny Knox has a higher score than John Huston. I need to check their respective scores in the table to see if this is accurate.\n\nLooking at the table, each row provides information about different players, including their place, name, country, total score, to par, and money earned. The key here is the 'score' column because that's what the claim is about.\n\nLet me find the rows for Kenny Knox and John Huston. \n\nKenny Knox is in Row 4. His total score is listed as 67 + 71 + 70 + 74 = 282. So, his total score is 282.\n\nJohn Huston is in Row 9. His score is given as 70 + 72 + 70 + 72 = 284. Therefore, John Huston's total score is 284.\n\nNow, comparing the two: Kenny Knox has a score of 282, and John Huston has a score of 284. Since 282 is less than 284, this means that Kenny Knox actually has a lower score than John Huston. \n\nWait a minute, but in golf, lower scores are better because they indicate fewer strokes. However, the claim is about who has the \"higher number\" score, not necessarily who performed better. So higher number-wise, 284 is indeed higher than 282.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify: in golf, a lower total score means a better performance because it's fewer strokes. But the claim isn't about who played better; it's specifically asking if Kenny Knox has a higher number score than John Huston. \n\nSo numerically, 284 is higher than 282. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because Kenny's score (282) is actually lower than John's (284). Wait, no\u2014that would mean the claim is FALSE because it's stating that Kenny has a higher score when in reality his numerical score is lower.\n\nWait, I'm getting this mixed up. The claim says Kenny Knox received a higher number score. If Kenny's total is 282 and John's is 284, then 282 is less than 284. So Kenny's score is numerically lower. Therefore, the claim that he has a higher score is FALSE.\n\nWait again\u2014am I interpreting this correctly? The claim states \"Kenny Knox receive a higher number score than John Huston.\" So if Kenny's score is 282 and John's is 284, then John has a higher number. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because Kenny does not have a higher score; he has a lower one.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should double-check the rows to ensure I didn't mix up their scores. Let me go back:\n\nRow 4: Kenny Knox's score is 67 +71 +70 +74 =282.\nRow 9: John Huston's score is 70+72+70+72=284.\n\nYes, so 282 < 284. Therefore, the claim that Kenny has a higher number score than John is FALSE because his total is actually lower.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.
