    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"4 of the team have a minus goal difference while only 4 have score more goal than those against them.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part means. A \"minus goal difference\" would mean that the team has scored fewer goals than they've conceded, so their difference is negative. On the other hand, if a team has scored more goals than against them, their difference should be positive.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see there are 9 rows, each representing a different team with various statistics. The relevant column here is \"difference,\" which I assume represents the goal difference (goals for minus goals against).\n\nLet me go through each row and note the \"difference\" value:\n\n1. Flamengo: 8 (positive)\n2. Fluminense: 10 (positive)\n3. Corinthians: 4 (positive)\n4. Palestra It\u00e1lia: 3 (positive)\n5. Portuguesa: -10 (negative)\n6. Botafogo: 0 (neutral, neither positive nor negative)\n7. Vasco da Gama: -2 (negative)\n8. Am\u00e9rica: -10 (negative)\n9. S\u00e3o Paulo: -13 (negative)\n\nNow, I'll count how many teams have a minus goal difference and how many have a positive one.\n\nStarting with the minus differences:\n- Portuguesa: -10\n- Vasco da Gama: -2\n- Am\u00e9rica: -10\n- S\u00e3o Paulo: -13\n\nThat's 4 teams with negative differences. \n\nNow for the positive differences:\n- Flamengo: 8\n- Fluminense: 10\n- Corinthians: 4\n- Palestra It\u00e1lia: 3\n\nThat's also 4 teams. However, there's Botafogo with a difference of 0, which is neutral. The claim doesn't mention the neutral case; it only talks about minus and scoring more (positive). \n\nSo according to the counts:\n- Minus goal differences: 4 teams\n- Positive goal differences: 4 teams\n\nThe claim states exactly that: \"4 have a minus... while only 4 have scored more.\" So based on this, the numbers match. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nI also need to list the relevant cells for each part of the claim. For the minus differences, I'll include all four rows with negative difference values (rows 5,7,8,9). For the positive differences, the first four rows (1-4) have positive differences. Botafogo's row isn't included because their difference is zero, which doesn't fall into either category mentioned in the claim.\n\nSo compiling this information, the answer should be TRUE, with the relevant cells being those where the \"difference\" column has negative or positive values as counted.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"difference\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "claim": "the top 2 team have the same number of point but separate by a goal difference",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the top 2 team have the same number of points but separate by a goal difference\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the table shows. It looks like it's a sports league standings table with teams ranked by position. Each row represents a team and has details like their position, name, points, games played, against (which I think refers to goals scored or maybe shots?), and difference, which is likely goal difference.\n\nThe claim mentions two things: that the top 2 teams have the same number of points and that they are separated by a goal difference. So, I need to check both parts of this statement.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1 (position 1): Flamengo has 13 points.\nRow 2 (position 2): Fluminense also has 13 points.\n\nSo, both top teams have the same number of points. That part checks out.\n\nNext, I need to check if they are separated by a goal difference. The column named \"difference\" likely represents the goal difference. \n\nFor Flamengo: Difference is 8.\nFor Fluminense: Difference is 10.\n\nSo, Fluminense has a higher goal difference than Flamengo. In sports standings, when two teams have the same points, they are usually sorted by goal difference. Therefore, Fluminense being above Flamengo makes sense because their goal difference is higher.\n\nWait, but in the table, Flamengo is at position 1 and Fluminense is at position 2. That means despite having the same points, Fluminense has a better (higher) goal difference but is ranked lower? Wait, that doesn't make sense because usually, a higher goal difference would mean a better ranking.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check the table:\n\nRow 1: Flamengo - Position 1, Points 13, Difference 8\nRow 2: Fluminense - Position 2, Points 13, Difference 10\n\nSo, even though Fluminense has a higher goal difference (10 vs. 8), they are ranked second. That seems contradictory because in most leagues, if two teams have the same points, the one with a better goal difference is placed higher.\n\nBut according to this table, Flamengo is first despite having a lower goal difference than Fluminense. This might be an error in the table or perhaps another factor is at play here. However, for the purpose of evaluating the claim, I need to focus on whether they have the same points and are separated by goal difference.\n\nThe claim says they're separated by a goal difference, which means their positions are determined by that. But according to the standings given, even though both have 13 points, Flamengo is first with a lower goal difference than Fluminense who is second. That would mean that in this case, despite having higher points or same points and better goal difference, the ranking doesn't follow the usual rule.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something about the table's structure. Let me re-examine:\n\nThe \"against\" column has values like 12 for Flamengo and 15 for Fluminense. Maybe \"against\" refers to goals against, so their goal difference is calculated as goals scored minus goals against? But in that case, Flamengo's difference is 8, which would be goals scored (maybe implied) minus 12 equals 8. So goals scored would be 20 for Flamengo.\n\nFluminense has a difference of 10, so goals scored would be 25 if goals against are 15? Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the table only provides \"against\" and \"difference\". \n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"difference\" is goals scored minus goals conceded. So, Flamengo has a difference of +8, while Fluminense has +10.\n\nIn that case, even though both have 13 points, Fluminense should be above Flamengo because they have a better goal difference. But in the table, Flamengo is first and Fluminense is second. So this seems inconsistent with standard ranking rules where same points would have higher goal difference teams ranked higher.\n\nHowever, for the claim's sake, it says that the top 2 teams are separated by goal difference. That is, their positions differ because of the goal difference even though they have the same points. But in reality, in this table, Flamengo has lower goal difference but is placed first, which contradicts the usual rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The claim doesn't say anything about the order being correct according to goal difference; it just states that they're separated by a goal difference. So regardless of who is higher, as long as their points are equal and their difference is different, the separation is due to that.\n\nIn this case, both have 13 points, and their differences are 8 and 10 respectively. So yes, the top two teams have same points but differ in goal difference, hence separated by it.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe top two teams (Flamengo and Fluminense) both have 13 points. Despite having the same points, they are ranked differently based on their goal differences (8 vs. 10), indicating that the separation between them is due to this difference.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"difference\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"3 team tie on point but be separate by goal difference\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that three teams have tied points, meaning they all have the same number of points. However, their positions are different because their goal differences vary, which separates them in the standings.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll check each row to see how many points each team has and then look at their goal difference (difference column). \n\nStarting from the top:\n- Row 1: Flamengo has 13 points with a difference of 8.\n- Row 2: Fluminense also has 13 points but a higher difference of 10.\n- Row 3: Corinthians have 9 points, so they're not part of the tie.\n- Rows 4 to 9 show teams with lower points than 13.\n\nSo, only Flamengo and Fluminense are at 13 points. But wait, that's just two teams. The claim says three teams tied on points. Since there are only two teams with 13 points each, the first part of the claim isn't satisfied. Therefore, the claim can't be TRUE because it requires three teams to tie on points.\n\nAdditionally, even if we consider other point totals:\n- Corinthians have 9 points alone.\n- Palestra Italia has 8 points.\n- Portuguesa with 7, Botafogo and Vasco with 6 each, Am\u00e9rica also 6, S\u00e3o Paulo at 4. None of these have three teams tied on the same points except maybe looking for lower point ties.\n\nWait, let's check for other possible three-way ties:\nLooking at points column again:\n- Points: 13 (2 teams)\n- 9 (1 team)\n- 8 (1)\n- 7 (1)\n- 6 occurs for Botafogo (row 6), Vasco da Gama (row 7), and Am\u00e9rica (row 8). So three teams have 6 points each. Now, checking their differences:\nBotafogo: difference is 0\nVasco da Gama: -2\nAm\u00e9rica: -10\n\nSo these three teams are tied on points at 6 but separated by goal difference. This seems to fit the claim.\n\nWait, so I initially thought only two teams have 13 points, which doesn't satisfy the three-way tie, but there's another group of three with 6 points each. So does that make the claim TRUE?\n\nBut the original claim is about three teams tying on points and being separated by goal difference. Since such a trio exists (Botafogo, Vasco da Gama, Am\u00e9rica), the answer should be TRUE.\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier by focusing only on the top two teams. I need to check all possible point values to see if any three have the same. So yes, there is a group of three teams tied at 6 points each, and their goal differences are different, which separates them in position (rows 6-8).\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that three teams tie on points but are separated by goal difference. The table shows that Botafogo, Vasco da Gama, and Am\u00e9rica all have 6 points each, with differing goal differences of 0, -2, and -10 respectively.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"difference\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a table with information about several football teams and their performance metrics like points, played matches, goals against, and goal difference. The claim is that \"2 of the team have the same number of goals scored against them.\" My task is to determine if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand which column corresponds to the number of goals each team has conceded (goals against). Looking at the table headers: position, team, points, played, against, difference. The \"against\" column likely represents the total goals scored against each team.\n\nSo, for each row, I'll extract the value from the \"against\" column and check if any two teams have the same number here.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. **Flamengo**: Against = 12\n2. **Fluminense**: Against = 15\n3. **Corinthians**: Against = 15\n4. **Palestra It\u00e1lia**: Against = 19\n5. **Portuguesa**: Against = 23\n6. **Botafogo**: Against = 25\n7. **Vasco da Gama**: Against = 19\n8. **Am\u00e9rica**: Against = 25\n9. **S\u00e3o Paulo**: Against = 24\n\nNow, I'll look for duplicates in the \"against\" column:\n\n- Fluminense and Corinthians both have 15 goals against.\n- Vasco da Gama has 19, which is unique since Palestra It\u00e1lia also has 19 but they are different teams.\nWait no, Palestra It\u00e1lia has 19, and Vasco da Gama also has 19? Let me check again.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow 4: Palestra It\u00e1lia: against =19\n\nRow 7: Vasco da Gama: against=19. So two teams have 19 goals against as well. But in the initial count, I thought only Fluminense and Corinthians share 15. But actually, there are two instances of 15 (Fluminense and Corinthians) and two instances of 19 (Palestra It\u00e1lia and Vasco da Gama).\n\nSo, that's four teams with duplicated \"against\" numbers: two pairs.\n\nBut the claim is about at least two teams having the same number. So yes, there are multiple cases where this happens.\n\nWait a second, I need to make sure if the question is asking for exactly two or at least two. The wording says \"2 of the team have the same,\" so it's satisfied as long as there exists at least two teams sharing the same \"against\" value.\n\nSo in this case, both Fluminense and Corinthians have 15 against, which means the claim is TRUE.\n\nHowever, I should also check if any other teams share the same \"against\" numbers. For example:\n\n- Botafogo and Am\u00e9rica both have 25 against.\nWait, no: Botafogo is 25 (Row 6), Am\u00e9rica is also 25 (Row 8). So that's another pair.\n\nSimilarly, Palestra It\u00e1lia has 19 (Row4) and Vasco da Gama also has 19 (Row7).\n\nSo there are three pairs of teams with the same \"against\" numbers: two teams each. Therefore, definitely more than one case where two teams have the same against goals.\n\nBut the claim is just about whether at least two teams do so. So the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells, I need to list all rows and columns that support this conclusion. Since the claim is true because of multiple instances, but we only need two examples to confirm it, perhaps we can point out one pair. But since the question doesn't specify how many pairs are needed, just whether there are at least two teams with the same against goals, any single pair suffices.\n\nLooking at Fluminense (Row2) and Corinthians (Row3), both have 15 against. So those cells would be relevant. Alternatively, Palestra It\u00e1lia (Row4) and Vasco da Gama (Row7) also share 19. Or Botafogo (Row6) and Am\u00e9rica (Row8) with 25.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I can choose the first pair: Rows 2 and 3, column \"against\".\n\nWait, but in my initial thought, I considered that there are multiple pairs, so perhaps all of them should be included. However, the claim only requires two teams, so perhaps just showing one example is enough to confirm it's true.\n\nBut to fully support the claim, maybe we need to show at least one instance where two teams have the same against value.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that there are three such pairs, but for the sake of this problem, as long as at least two exist, the answer is TRUE. So the relevant cells would be Rows 2 and 3's \"against\" column, or any other pair.\n\nI think for clarity, listing all instances where duplicates occur might be more thorough, but perhaps it's sufficient to show one example since the claim only requires that at least two teams have this.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows multiple instances where two teams have the same number of goals against. Specifically, Fluminense and Corinthians both have 15 goals against, Palestra It\u00e1lia and Vasco da Gama both have 19 goals against, and Botafogo and Am\u00e9rica both have 25 goals against. This confirms that at least two teams share the same number of goals against.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It seems like it's saying that the two teams in the top positions have different points, and the second-place team is trailing the first by exactly 2 points.\n\nLooking at the table, the first row (position 1) is Flamengo with 13 points, and the second row (position 2) is Fluminense also with 13 points.

So same points, so the first part of the claim that they hold a different amount is false because they have the same points.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"less than 3 teams hold a minus goal difference, while more than 5 have scored more goals against them.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. Less than 3 teams have a negative goal difference.\n2. More than 5 teams have scored more goals against them.\n\nI need to verify each part separately using the data from the table provided.\n\nLet's start with the first condition: \"less than 3 teams hold a minus goal difference.\" \n\nLooking at the table, I'll check the 'difference' column for each team. The 'difference' represents the goal difference (goals scored minus goals against). A negative value means they have a minus goal difference.\n\n- Flamengo: +8\n- Fluminense: +10\n- Corinthians: +4\n- Palestra It\u00e1lia: +3\n- Portuguesa: -10\n- Botafogo: 0 (which is neither plus nor minus)\n- Vasco da Gama: -2\n- Am\u00e9rica: -10\n- S\u00e3o Paulo: -13\n\nNow, counting the teams with a negative difference:\n- Portuguesa: -10 \u2192 Yes\n- Vasco da Gama: -2 \u2192 Yes\n- Am\u00e9rica: -10 \u2192 Yes\n- S\u00e3o Paulo: -13 \u2192 Yes\n\nWait, that's four teams. But the claim says \"less than 3.\" Hmm, so according to this count, it's actually four teams with a negative goal difference, which is more than three. That would make the first part of the claim FALSE.\n\nMoving on to the second condition: \"more than 5 teams have scored more goals against them.\"\n\nI need to check the 'against' column, which represents goals against each team. The statement says that more than five teams have a higher number in this column compared to their points or something else? Wait, no\u2014the wording is a bit unclear. It says \"more than 5 have score more goal against them.\" I think it means more than five teams have a high 'against' value, but perhaps the exact threshold isn't clear.\n\nLooking at the 'against' numbers:\n- Flamengo: 12\n- Fluminense: 15\n- Corinthians: 15\n- Palestra It\u00e1lia: 19\n- Portuguesa: 23\n- Botafogo: 25\n- Vasco da Gama: 19\n- Am\u00e9rica: 25\n- S\u00e3o Paulo: 24\n\nNow, how many have a high 'against' value? The claim says \"more than five\" so let's see. If we consider teams with goals against higher than, say, the average or a certain threshold, but since it's not specified, I think any team has some against goals. However, perhaps the claim is referring to teams having more against goals than goals for (difference). But that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'against' column directly indicates how many goals were scored against them. So, the statement is saying more than five teams have a high number of goals against them. Let's see:\n\nLooking at each team:\n- Flamengo: 12\n- Fluminense: 15\n- Corinthians: 15\n- Palestra It\u00e1lia: 19\n- Portuguesa: 23\n- Botafogo: 25\n- Vasco da Gama: 19\n- Am\u00e9rica: 25\n- S\u00e3o Paulo: 24\n\nMost of these are relatively high, but the claim is that more than five teams have scored more goals against them. Since there are nine teams in total, and more than five would be six or more.\n\nCounting how many teams have a higher 'against' value\u2014actually, all teams have some against goals, but perhaps the statement is just about the quantity of teams with any against goals, which is all nine, so that's more than five. However, considering the first part was four teams having negative differences, making the claim as a whole FALSE.\n\nWait, maybe I misinterpreted the second condition. Let me read it again: \"more than 5 have score more goal against them.\" It could mean that more than five teams have scored more goals against others, but that doesn't make much sense because 'against' is goals conceded. Alternatively, perhaps it's about teams having a higher number of goals against than their points or something else. But without more context, I think the second part is trying to say that more than five teams have high goals against them.\n\nIn any case, since the first condition was four teams (which contradicts \"less than 3\"), making the overall claim FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim has two parts. The first part states that less than three teams have a negative goal difference. From the table, four teams (Portuguesa, Vasco da Gama, Am\u00e9rica, and S\u00e3o Paulo) have negative differences, which makes this part false. The second part mentions more than five teams having scored more goals against them, but since the first condition is already false, the entire claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"difference\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if the claim \"over 3 team have the same number of goals scored against them\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each column represents. The columns are position, team, points, played, against, and difference. From context, I assume \"against\" refers to the number of goals a team has conceded (goals scored against them). So, my focus is on the \"against\" column.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 1: Flamengo has 12 goals against.\n- Row 2: Fluminense also has 12 goals against.\n- Row 3: Corinthians have 15 goals against.\n- Row 4: Palestra It\u00e1lia has 19 goals against.\n- Row 5: Portuguesa has 23 goals against.\n- Row 6: Botafogo has 25 goals against.\n- Row 7: Vasco da Gama has 19 goals against.\n- Row 8: Am\u00e9rica also has 25 goals against.\n- Row 9: S\u00e3o Paulo has 24 goals against.\n\nNow, I need to check if more than three teams have the same number of goals against them. Let's list out the \"against\" values and their counts:\n\n- 12 appears twice (Flamengo and Fluminense).\n- 15 appears once (Corinthians).\n- 19 appears twice (Palestra It\u00e1lia and Vasco da Gama).\n- 23 appears once (Portuguesa).\n- 24 appears once (S\u00e3o Paulo).\n- 25 appears twice (Botafogo and Am\u00e9rica).\n\nFrom this, the maximum number of teams sharing the same \"against\" value is two. For example, both Flamengo and Fluminense have 12 goals against them. Similarly, Palestra It\u00e1lia and Vasco da Gama share 19, and Botafogo and Am\u00e9rica share 25.\n\nSince no more than three teams share the same number of goals against, the claim that \"over 3 team have the same...\" is not supported by the data. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are all in the \"against\" column across each row because we need to compare each team's goals against to check for duplicates.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "none team tie on point , but most be separate by more than 1 goal difference",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"none team tie on point , but most be separate by more than 1 goal difference.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this means. It looks like there are two parts to the claim:\n\n1. No teams have tied points.\n2. If points were tied (but since they aren't), then they must be separated by more than one goal difference.\n\nWait, actually reading it again: \"none team tie on point , but most be separate by more than 1 goal difference.\" Hmm, maybe it's saying that no two teams have the same points, and if any did, they would need to be separated by more than a one-goal difference. But in this case, since none are tied, does the second part matter? Or is it just stating both conditions?\n\nBut let me check the table.\n\nLooking at the \"points\" column:\n\n- Flamengo: 13\n- Fluminense: 13\n- Corinthians: 9\n- Palestra It\u00e1lia: 8\n- Portuguesa:7\n- Botafogo:6\n- Vasco da Gama:6\n- Am\u00e9rica:6\n- S\u00e3o Paulo:4\n\nWait, I see that Flamengo and Fluminense both have 13 points. So the first part of the claim says \"none team tie on point,\" but in reality, two teams do tie on points (Flamengo and Fluminense). Therefore, this makes the claim false because it's stated that no teams tie on points.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread the claim. Let me parse it again: \"none team tie on point , but most be separate by more than 1 goal difference.\" Maybe it's a bit confusingly phrased. Perhaps it means that if any teams are tied in points, they must be separated by more than one goal difference.\n\nBut according to the table, there is a tie between Flamengo and Fluminense with 13 points each. So let's check their goal differences.\n\nFlamengo: difference of +8\nFluminense: difference of +10\n\nThe difference in their goal differences is 2 (10 - 8). Since 2 is more than 1, the second part holds for this pair. But wait, since they are tied on points, does that violate the first condition? The claim says \"none team tie on point,\" which isn't true because we have a tie.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Perhaps the claim is trying to say that even if teams are not tied in points, their separation by more than one goal difference is required when they are close in points. But that doesn't seem to be the case here because the first part clearly states \"none team tie on point,\" which isn't true.\n\nSo, breaking it down:\n\n- Are there any teams tied in points? Yes: Flamengo and Fluminense both have 13.\n- Therefore, the claim's first condition is false.\n\nEven though when they are tied, their goal difference separation is more than one (which satisfies the second part), the fact that they are tied contradicts the first part of the claim. Hence, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells:\n\nFor Flamengo and Fluminense:\n- Check \"points\" for both teams.\nSo row 1: points (13)\nRow 2: points (13)\n\nThat's enough to show a tie in points, making the first part of the claim false. So these are the relevant cells.\n\nI think that's all needed because once we find two teams with the same points, it disproves the claim regardless of other factors.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Flamengo and Fluminense both have 13 points, indicating a tie. This violates the first part of the claim, making the entire statement false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
