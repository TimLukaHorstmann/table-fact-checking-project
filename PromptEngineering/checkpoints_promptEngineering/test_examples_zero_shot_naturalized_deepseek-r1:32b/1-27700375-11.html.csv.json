    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"brook lopez lead the team in both point and rebound in a single game 3 different times.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what this means. It's saying that Brook Lopez was the top scorer (led in points) and also led in rebounds for his team in three separate games.\n\nLooking at the table, there are seven rows, each representing a game. For each row, I need to check two things: who had the high points and who had the high rebounds. Then, see if Brook Lopez was both the top scorer and rebounder in any of those games. Finally, count how many times this happened.\n\nStarting with Row 1 (Game 75):\n- High Points: Brandan Wright (15)\n- High Rebounds: Brandan Wright (11)\nSo, Brook Lopez isn't leading here. Not relevant.\n\nRow 2 (Game 76):\n- High Points: Deron Williams (18)\n- High Rebounds: Travis Outlaw (9)\nAgain, not Brook. So nothing here.\n\nRow 3 (Game 77):\n- High Points: Brook Lopez (30)\n- High Rebounds: Brook Lopez (12)\nYes! Here, Brook leads in both points and rebounds. That's the first instance.\n\nRow 4 (Game 78):\n- High Points: Brook Lopez (39)\n- High Rebounds: Brook Lopez (7)\nAnother time he leads both. Second instance.\n\nRow 5 (Game 79):\n- High Points: Brook Lopez (27)\n- High Rebounds: Jordan Farmar (8)\nHe led in points but not rebounds here. So this doesn't count.\n\nRow 6 (Game 80):\n- High Points: Brook Lopez (35)\n- High Rebounds: Brook Lopez (11)\nThird time he leads both. That's the third instance.\n\nRow 7 (Game 81):\n- High Points: Brook Lopez (31)\n- High Rebounds: Dan Gadzuric (8)\nHe led in points but not rebounds again. So this doesn't count either.\n\nSo, across the games, there are three instances where Brook Lopez led both in points and rebounds:\n- Game 77\n- Game 78\n- Game 80\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by three instances in Games 77, 78, and 80 where Brook Lopez led in both points and rebounds.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is \"the nets' only win come at the prudential center.\" I need to determine if this is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to identify which games resulted in a win for the Nets. From the table:\n\n- Row 1: Score is L 90-115 (OT), so it's a loss.\n- Row 2: Score is L 94-108 (OT), another loss.\n- Row 3: Score is W 107-105 (OT), this is a win. I'll note the location here as Prudential Center.\n- Rows 4 to 7 all show losses, except for checking if any other wins exist.\n\nSo, there's only one win in the table, which is in Row 3. Now, I need to check where that game was played. Looking at the \"location attendance\" column for Row 3: it's Prudential Center with an attendance of 13461.\n\nNext, I should confirm if all other wins (if any) are also at Prudential Center. Since there's only one win in this table, and it was at Prudential Center, the claim seems to hold based on the data provided. However, I need to ensure that there are no other wins elsewhere.\n\nGoing through each row again:\n\n- Rows 1,2: Losses.\n- Row3: Win at Prudential Center.\n- Rows4-7: All losses.\n\nTherefore, in this dataset, the Nets only won once, and that was indeed at Prudential Center. Hence, the claim appears to be TRUE according to the table provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_3\", \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nHowever, following your exact instructions and the correct JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut since row indexes start at 0:\n\nThe correct JSON with proper row indices (Row 3 is index 2) should be:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut according to the user's initial table, Row 3 is index 2. So, in the correct format with proper row indices and column names:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_ cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut let's make sure the row indexes are correct. The table has rows 1 to 7 in naturalized format. In JSON array indices, they start at 0.\n\nSo Row 1: index 0\nRow 2: index 1\nRow3 (game77): index 2\n\nYes, so the relevant cells are:\n\nRow3's score and location attendance, which are row_index 2.\n\nSo final answer is TRUE because only one win in the table is at Prudential Center.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_ cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut in proper JSON without the typo:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"brook lopez lead the team in point for 5 straight game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each row represents. The table has seven rows, each corresponding to a different game (game numbers 75 through 81). Each row contains information about the date, team played against, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, and the team's record after that game.\n\nThe claim is about Brook Lopez leading the team in points for five consecutive games. To verify this, I should check each relevant game to see who had the highest points and if it was consistently Brook Lopez across those five games.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. **Game 75 (Row 1):** The high points are Brandan Wright with 15 points.\n2. **Game 76 (Row 2):** Deron Williams led with 18 points.\n3. **Game 77 (Row 3):** Brook Lopez scored 30 points, leading the team.\n4. **Game 78 (Row 4):** Again, Brook Lopez had the highest with 39 points.\n5. **Game 79 (Row 5):** He led again with 27 points.\n6. **Game 80 (Row 6):** Brook Lopez scored 35 points, still leading.\n7. **Game 81 (Row 7):** He had 31 points, maintaining his lead.\n\nNow, the claim mentions \"5 straight games.\" So I need to check if there's a sequence of five consecutive games where Brook Lopez led in points each time.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Game 75: Not Lopez\n- Game 76: Not Lopez\n- Game 77: Lopez leads (1st game)\n- Game 78: Lopez leads (2nd game)\n- Game 79: Lopez leads (3rd game)\n- Game 80: Lopez leads (4th game)\n- Game 81: Lopez leads (5th game)\n\nFrom Game 77 to Game 81, that's five consecutive games where Brook Lopez led in points. However, the claim doesn't specify starting from a particular point, just \"5 straight games.\" So checking the table, I see that there is indeed a stretch of five consecutive games (Games 77-81) where Lopez was the leading scorer each time.\n\nWait, but wait: The first two games (75 and 76) were led by others. Then starting from Game 77, it's four games in a row. Wait, Game 77 is the third game listed. Let me recount:\n\n- Game 75: April 1\n- Game 76: April 3\n- Game 77: April 5 (Lopez leads)\n- Game 78: April 6 (Lopez leads)\n- Game 79: April 8 (Lopez leads)\n- Game 80: April 10 (Lopez leads)\n- Game 81: April 11 (Lopez leads)\n\nSo starting from Game 77, there are five consecutive games where Lopez led in points. Therefore, the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It's making two points: \n\n1. The most highly attended game was played against Miami.\n2. That game took place at the Prudential Center.\n\nI need to check both parts of this statement against the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, there are seven rows, each representing a different game. Each row has various details like date, team, score, location attendance, etc.\n\nLet me first identify which games were played against Miami. I'll go through each row and look for where the 'team' column is 'miami'.\n\nRow 2: Game 76 is against Miami. The location attendance here is Prudential Center with 18,711 attendees. So that's one data point.\n\nNow, I need to check if this is indeed the highest attendance across all games. Let me list out all the attendances:\n\n- Row 1: Wells Fargo Center - 16,695\n- Row 2: Prudential Center - 18,711\n- Row 3: Prudential Center - 13,461\n- Row 4: The Palace of Auburn Hills - 14,554\n- Row 5: Prudential Center - 18,023\n- Row 6: Air Canada Centre - 17,755\n- Row 7: Prudential Center - 13,853\n\nLooking at these numbers, the highest attendance is in Row 2 with 18,711. So that's the most attended game.\n\nNext, I need to confirm if this game was against Miami and took place at the Prudential Center. From Row 2, yes, it was against Miami, and the location was Prudential Center with attendance of 18,711.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the data: the most attended game (highest number) was indeed against Miami at the Prudential Center.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE.

It states that Brook Lopez led his team in assists in more games than Deron Williams did. So I need to count how many times each of them had the highest assist numbers per game and then compare those counts.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 7 rows, each representing a game (from Game 75 to Game 81). For each row, the column \"high assists\" tells who led in assists for that game. I'll go through each game one by one:\n\n- **Game 75 (Row 1):** High Assists - Deron Williams (7)\n- **Game 76 (Row 2):** High Assists - Deron Williams (9)\n- **Game 77 (Row 3):** High Assists - Deron Williams (21)\n- **Game 78 (Row 4):** High Assists - Jordan Farmar (11) \u2192 Neither Brook nor Deron\n- **Game 79 (Row 5):** High Assists - Jordan Farmar (9) \u2192 Neither Brook nor Deron\n- **Game 80 (Row 6):** High Assists - Jordan Farmar (7) \u2192 Neither Brook nor Deron\n- **Game 81 (Row 7):** High Assists - Jordan Farmar (9) \u2192 Neither Brook nor Deron\n\nNow, counting the games where each led:\n\n- **Deron Williams:** Games 75, 76, and 77.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"jordan farmar lead the team in point for 5 straight game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. The claim states that Jordan Farmar led his team in points for five consecutive games. So, I need to check if there are five games in a row where Jordan Farmar had the highest points among his teammates.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, opposing team, score, and key players' stats. Specifically, the columns of interest here are \"high points\" for each game because that tells us who scored the most in that particular game.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to see if Jordan Farmar is listed under \"high points.\" Let's list out the games:\n\n1. **Game 75 (April 1):** High points are Brandan Wright with 15.\n2. **Game 76 (April 3):** Deron Williams led with 18 points.\n3. **Game 77 (April 5):** Brook Lopez scored the most with 30.\n4. **Game 78 (April 6):** Again, Brook Lopez with 39 points.\n5. **Game 79 (April 8):** Brook Lopez led with 27.\n6. **Game 80 (April 10):** Brook Lopez had 35 points.\n7. **Game 81 (April 11):** Brook Lopez scored the most with 31.\n\nFrom this, I notice that Jordan Farmar is not listed under \"high points\" in any of these games. It seems that Brook Lopez was consistently leading the team in points during this stretch, and sometimes Deron Williams or others were the top scorers. \n\nWait a second, perhaps I missed something? Let me double-check each row:\n\n- **Game 75:** Brandan Wright (15)\n- **Game 76:** Deron Williams (18)\n- **Game 77:** Brook Lopez (30)\n- **Game 78:** Brook Lopez (39)\n- **Game 79:** Brook Lopez (27)\n- **Game 80:** Brook Lopez (35)\n- **Game 81:** Brook Lopez (31)\n\nYes, in none of these games did Jordan Farmar lead in points. Therefore, the claim that he led for five straight games is not supported by the data provided.\n\nSo, I'll conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the most highly attended game was against minnesota at the prudential center.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down what this claim is saying. It suggests that among all the games listed, the one played against the Minnesota team at the Prudential Center had the highest attendance.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with various details like date, opponent, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, and record. The relevant columns here are 'team' (to find games against Minnesota) and 'location attendance' (to check the number of attendees).\n\nLet me go through each row to identify which games were against Minnesota and their corresponding attendances.\n\nRow 3: This is game number 77 on April 5 against the Minnesota team. The location was Prudential Center with an attendance of 13,461.\n\nNow, I need to check all other rows to see if any other games had higher attendance at the Prudential Center or if another opponent's game had a higher attendance elsewhere.\n\nLooking at other rows:\n- Row 2: Miami team, attendance 18,711 (location Prudential Center)\n- Row 4: Detroit, attendance 14,554 (location The Palace of Auburn Hills)\n- Row 5: New York, attendance 18,023 (Prudential Center)\n- Row 6: Toronto, attendance 17,755 (Air Canada Centre)\n- Row 7: Charlotte, attendance 13,853 (Prudential Center)\n\nFrom this, the highest attendances at Prudential Center are:\n- Row 2: 18,711\n- Row 5: 18,023\n- Row 7: 13,853\n\nComparing these to row 3's attendance of 13,461 against Minnesota at Prudential Center, it's clear that the games in rows 2 and 5 had higher attendances. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because while there was a game against Minnesota at Prudential Center (row 3), it wasn't the most highly attended. The highest attendance at Prudential Center occurred in games against Miami and New York.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 3's 'team' and 'location attendance' to confirm the opponent and attendance.\n- Rows 2,5,7 for their attendances at Prudential Center to compare.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_2\", \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_5\", \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_7\", \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
