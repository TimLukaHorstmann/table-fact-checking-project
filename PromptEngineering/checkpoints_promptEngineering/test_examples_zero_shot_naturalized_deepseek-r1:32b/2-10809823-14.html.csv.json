The claim says: \"Prince park be 1 of the 6 venue that be put to use on 28 june 1980.\" Hmm, first thing I notice is a typo in the venue name\u2014should probably be \"Princes Park\" instead of \"Prince park.\" But maybe it's just a minor mistake and they mean the same place.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows, each representing a game on June 28, 1980. Each row has details like home team, away team, venue, etc. I need to check if \"Princes Park\" is listed as one of the venues in these games.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Venue is Kardinia Park.\nRow 2: Western Oval.\nRow 3: Princes Park\u2014yes, that's the one mentioned in the claim.\nRow 4: Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).\nRow 5: Lake Oval.\nRow 6: VFL Park.\n\nSo, counting them up, we have Kardinia Park, Western Oval, Princes Park, MCg, Lake Oval, and VFL Park. That's six venues in total, each hosting a game on that date. Since Row 3 specifically lists Princes Park as the venue, it is indeed one of the six used on June 28, 1980.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Princes Park was among the venues used that day.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Each row includes details like home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd size, and date.\n\nThe claim is: \"western oval venue recorded a lower crowd participation than that of the kardinia park venue.\" I need to determine if this claim is true or false based on the data provided in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll identify which rows correspond to each venue. Looking at Row 1: Kardinia Park has a crowd of 21555. Then, looking through the other rows, Row 2 mentions Western Oval with a crowd of 11785. The rest of the venues (Princes Park, MCG, Lake Oval, VFL Park) aren't relevant here because they're not part of the claim.\n\nSo, I need to compare the crowd numbers at Western Oval and Kardinia Park. From Row 2, Western Oval had a smaller crowd (11785) compared to Kardinia Park's 21555 in Row 1. That means Western Oval indeed has a lower crowd participation.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.

The claim says, \"north melbourne away team record an away score of 4.3 (27) while melbourne record an away score of 6.7 (43).\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each part of the claim separately and check against the table data.\n\nStarting with North Melbourne: The claim states that they are the away team with a score of 4.3 (27). Looking through the rows, I see Row 1 has home team Geelong and away team North Melbourne. Their score is indeed listed as 4.3 (27). So this part checks out.\n\nNext, the claim mentions Melbourne recording an away score of 6.7 (43). Scanning the table again, I check each row where the away team is Melbourne. Row 2 shows Footscray as the home team and Melbourne as the away team with a score of 6.7 (43). That's exactly what the claim says.\n\nI should also make sure there are no other rows where Melbourne might be an away team, but looking through Rows 1 to 6, Row 2 is the only one where Melbourne is the away team. So both parts of the claim align perfectly with the data in the table.\n\nTherefore, since both claims about North Melbourne and Melbourne being away teams with their respective scores are accurate according to the table, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately reflects the data for both North Melbourne and Melbourne as away teams with their respective scores.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states two things: it was during the 1980 VFL season, and the MCg venue had the highest crowd participation. \n\nLooking at the table, all rows are from June 28, 1980. So the data is indeed from the 1980 season.\n\nNow, for each game played at different venues, we need to check the crowd numbers:\n\n- Kardinia Park: 21555\n- Western Oval: 11785\n- Princes Park: 8209\n- MCg: 64054\n- Lake Oval: 12362\n- VFL Park: 20485\n\nComparing these numbers, the highest crowd is clearly at MCg with 64054 attendees. \n\nSo the claim is TRUE because MCg had the largest attendance among all listed venues on that date in 1980.\n\nThe relevant cells are the \"crowd\" column for each venue to compare their attendances.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Each row has information about a match including home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd, and date. The claim mentions two venues: VFL Park and Lake Oval. I need to find out how many people attended each of these venues.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nRow 6 is about St Kilda vs Essendon at VFL Park with a crowd of 20485.\nRow 5 is South Melbourne vs Carlton at Lake Oval, with a crowd of 12362.\n\nThe claim says that VFL Park had 8123 more attendees than Lake Oval. So I'll subtract the two crowds: 20485 (VFL) minus 12362 (Lake). Let me calculate that:\n\n20485 - 12362 = ?\n\nLet's do it step by step:\n20,485\n-12,362\n---------\nSubtracting the thousands: 20k -12k is 8k. Then the hundreds and tens: 485 - 362 is 123. So total is 8,123.\n\nYes, that's exactly what the claim states.

So I need to check which venue had the lowest crowd and see if it's Prince Park or another one.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: Kardinia Park, Crowd: 21555\n- Row 2: Western Oval, Crowd: 11785\n- Row 3: Princes Park, Crowd: 8209\n- Row 4: MCG, Crowd: 64054\n- Row 5: Lake Oval, Crowd: 12362\n- Row 6: VFL Park, Crowd: 20485\n\nI need to find the smallest crowd number.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"western oval venue record a lower crowd participation and host a lower away scorer team than that of the kardinia park venue.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the claim into two parts. The first part is about crowd participation (crowd numbers) at Western Oval compared to Kardinia Park. The second part is about whether the away team's score at Western Oval was lower than that at Kardinia Park.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows, each representing a different game on June 28, 1980. Each row has information like home team, their score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nI'll start by identifying which rows correspond to Western Oval and Kardinia Park. \n\nFrom the table:\n- Row 1 is at Kardinia Park: home team Geelong vs away team North Melbourne.\n- Row 2 is at Western Oval: home team Footscray vs away team Melbourne.\n\nSo, for crowd participation, I need to compare the 'crowd' numbers of these two venues. \n\nLooking at Row 1 (Kardinia Park), the crowd was 21,555. For Row 2 (Western Oval), the crowd was 11,785. So, Western Oval indeed had a lower crowd participation than Kardinia Park.\n\nNext, regarding the away scorer teams: I need to compare the scores of the away teams at each venue. \n\nAt Kardinia Park (Row 1), the away team was North Melbourne with a score of 4.3 (27). At Western Oval (Row 2), the away team was Melbourne with a score of 6.7 (43). So, comparing these two, 4.3 is lower than 6.7. That means Kardinia Park's away team scored less points than Western Oval's away team.\n\nWait, but the claim says that Western Oval \"host a lower away scorer team\" than Kardinia Park. If we're looking at which venue has a lower scoring away team, since Kardinia Park had an away team score of 4.3 (27) and Western Oval had 6.7 (43), then actually Kardinia Park's away team scored less points, meaning that Western Oval did NOT host a lower away scorer team compared to Kardinia Park. In fact, the opposite is true.\n\nSo putting it together: The first part of the claim is correct\u2014Western Oval had a lower crowd. But the second part is incorrect because Western Oval's away team actually scored more points than Kardinia Park's away team. \n\nTherefore, since both conditions in the claim need to be true for the overall statement to be TRUE, and one of them isn't, the entire claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim has two parts: lower crowd at Western Oval (true) and lower away score there compared to Kardinia Park (false).

It's talking about the 1980 VFL season and specifically whether the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) was the most attended venue that day.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows, each representing a different game on June 28, 1980.
