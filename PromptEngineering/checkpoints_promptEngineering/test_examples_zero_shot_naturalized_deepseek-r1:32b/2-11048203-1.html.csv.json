    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"hatem aqel have the same number of draw as loss\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that Hatem Aqel isn't mentioned in the table at all. The table lists various matches with details like dates, venues, scores, results, and competitions. None of these entries include any player names, so there's no direct information about Hatem Aqel's draws or losses from the data given.\n\nNext, I should consider whether the claim is referring to a specific team or context where Hatem Aqel might be associated. The table mentions competitions like the Arab Nations Cup and Asian Cup qualifications, as well as friendlies. Without knowing which team Hatem plays for, it's impossible to link his performance to these matches.\n\nSince there's no data about Hatem Aqel in the table, I can't verify the number of draws or losses he has. The claim might be based on external information not provided here, but without that context, I must rely solely on what's given.\n\nTherefore, since the necessary information isn't present in the table, the claim cannot be verified as TRUE. It should be considered FALSE based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"Hatem Aqel have more win than loss\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row of the table and check if Hatem Aqel's team won or lost in those matches. The relevant columns here are 'result' which indicates whether it was a win, loss, or draw, and possibly other details like venue or competition, but since the claim is about wins vs losses, I'll focus on the result column.\n\nStarting from Row 1:\n- Result: Draw \u2192 Not a win or loss for Hatem Aqel's team. So this doesn't contribute to either count.\n\nRow 2:\n- Result: Win \u2192 This counts as a win for Hatem Aqel's team.\n\nRow 3:\n- Result: Win \u2192 Another win.\n\nRow 4:\n- Result: Draw \u2192 Again, no contribution to wins or losses.\n\nRow 5:\n- Result: Win \u2192 Third win.\n\nRow 6:\n- Result: Win \u2192 Fourth win.\n\nRow 7:\n- Result: Loss \u2192 First loss for Hatem Aqel's team.\n\nRow 8:\n- Result: Loss \u2192 Second loss.\n\nRow 9:\n- Result: Win \u2192 Fifth win.\n\nNow, let me tally the wins and losses. From Rows 2,3,5,6,9 we have 5 wins. From Rows 7 and 8, there are 2 losses. So, 5 wins vs 2 losses.\n\nSince 5 is more than 2, the claim that Hatem Aqel has more wins than losses holds true. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to list all the relevant cells that contributed to this conclusion. The relevant column is 'result' from each row where there was a win or loss. So for Rows 2,3,5,6,7,8,9, the 'result' column is important.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Hatem Aqel has more wins than losses.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"the competition after the 1 on february 18, 2004 be a friendly competition.\" Hmm, that wording is a bit unclear. I think they're asking about the competition that occurred after February 18, 2004, specifically looking at the result of 'draw' or something else.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like date, venue, score, result, and competition. The key here is to find which row corresponds to February 18, 2004, and then check what the competition was after that date.\n\nRow 3 has the date: 18 february 2004, so that's our starting point. The competition there was \"2006 fifa world cup qualification\". Now, I need to see if any competitions after this date were friendly.\n\nLooking at rows after row 3:\n- Row 4 is August 18, 2004: the competition is \"friendly\".\n- Other rows after that include competitions like \"friendly\" as well.\n\nSo the claim is asking whether the competition after February 18, 2004, was a friendly one. From row 4 onwards, there are multiple instances of friendly competitions. Therefore, yes, there were friendly competitions after February 18, 2004.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the claim correctly. It says \"the competition after the 1 on february 18, 2004 be a friendly\". The '1' might refer to the result or score? In row 3, the score is 5-0 with a result of win. So maybe it's referring to that specific match.\n\nBut regardless, looking at competitions after February 18, 2004, there are definitely friendly competitions in subsequent rows. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe competition following February 18, 2004, included friendly matches as seen in row 4 and beyond. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the latest of all the competition be on october 28 2013\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim is saying. It states that the latest competition in the table happened on October 28, 2013. To verify this, I need to check all the dates in the table and see which one is the most recent.\n\nLooking at the table, there are nine rows with different dates. The dates go from December 2002 up to October 2013. Each row has a date, venue, score, result, and competition.\n\nI'll list out all the dates in order:\n\n1. 16 December 2002\n2. 17 October 2003\n3. 18 February 2004\n4. 18 August 2004\n5. 14 February 2006\n6. 22 February 2006\n7. 28 January 2009\n8. 9 September 2009\n9. 28 October 2013\n\nNow, I need to find the latest date among these. Comparing all of them, October 28, 2013 is indeed the most recent one since it's in 2013 and later than any other dates listed.\n\nSo, the claim says that this was the latest competition, which matches with what I found. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE. The relevant cell for this determination is Row 8 (indexing from zero, so row index 9-1=8) under the \"date\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the latest date in the table is October 28, 2013.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table and categorize them into 'friendly' competitions and other types. The relevant column here is 'competition'.\n\nRow 1: Competition is \"2002 arab nations cup\" \u2013 not friendly.\nRow 2: \"2004 afc asian cup qualification\" \u2013 not friendly.\nRow 3: \"2006 fifa world cup qualification\" \u2013 not friendly.\nRow 4: \"friendly\" \u2013 this counts as a friendly competition.\nRow 5: \"friendly\" \u2013 another friendly.\nRow 6: \"2007 afc asian cup qualification\" \u2013 not friendly.\nRow 7: \"2011 afc asian cup qualification\" \u2013 not friendly.\nRow 8: \"friendly\" \u2013 another friendly.\nRow 9: \"friendly\" \u2013 last friendly.\n\nNow, counting them up:\n- Friendly competitions: Rows 4,5,8,9 \u2192 that's 4 times.\n- Other types: Let me count these. The non-friendly rows are 1,2,3,6,7 \u2192 which is 5 times.\n\nThe claim states there is 1 less friendly competition than others. So, we have 4 friendly and 5 other. Is 4 equal to (5 -1)? Yes, because 5-1=4. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nTo support this, I'll note which rows are relevant: all rows where 'competition' was checked.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, each row represents a match with details like date, venue, score, result, and competition. The key columns here are \"result,\" which can be \"win,\" \"draw,\" or \"loss.\" \n\nThe claim is about Hatem Aqel's number of wins versus losses. So I need to count how many times the result was a win and how many times it was a loss.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Result is a draw. So neither a win nor a loss for Hatem.\n2. **Row 2**: Result is a win. That's +1 to wins.\n3. **Row 3**: Another win, so now wins are at 2.\n4. **Row 4**: It's a draw again; no impact on the count.\n5. **Row 5**: Win again, bringing wins to 3.\n6. **Row 6**: Yet another win, making it 4 wins in total.\n7. **Row 7**: The result is a loss. So losses start at 1.\n8. **Row 8**: Another loss, increasing the loss count to 2.\n9. **Row 9**: A win here, so now wins go up to 5.\n\nSo tallying them up: Hatem has 5 wins (from rows 2,3,5,6,9) and 2 losses (rows 7,8). \n\nThe claim says he has 1 more win than loss. Let's check the difference: 5 wins - 2 losses = 3. That means he actually has 3 more wins than losses, not just 1.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted? Let me recount:\n\nWins:\n- Row 2: Win\n- Row 3: Win\n- Row 5: Win\n- Row 6: Win\n- Row 9: Win \u2192 Total of 5 wins\n\nLosses:\n- Row 7: Loss\n- Row 8: Loss \u2192 Total of 2 losses\n\nDifference is indeed 3, not 1.

I need to check if there are any competitions in the table that span these dates.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 1: Date is December 16, 2002 (not 2003), so this might not be relevant. The competition here is the 2002 Arab Nations Cup. But since the date is 2002, it's before 2003.\n\nRow 2: October 17, 2003. That's within the timeframe starting from December 16, 2003?

Rows:\n\n- Row 2: AFC Asian Cup Qualification \u2192 1\n- Row 6: AFC Asian Cup Qualification \u2192 2\n- Row 7: AFC Asian Cup Qualification \u2192 3\n\nSo total AFC Asian Cup qualifications are 3.\n\nFor friendly competitions:\n- Row 4: friendly \u2192 1\n- Row 5: friendly \u2192 2\n- Row 8: friendly \u2192 3\n- Row 9: friendly \u2192 4\n\nSo there are 4 friendly competitions and 3 AFC Asian Cup qualifications.\n\nThe claim is that friendly competitions are 1 less than AFC Asian Cup qualifications. But according to my counts, it's the opposite: 4 friendlies vs 3 qualifications. So 4 is actually one more than 3, not one less.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there aren't fewer friendlies; instead, there are more.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_2\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_4\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_5\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_6\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_7\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_8\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_9\": \"competition\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
