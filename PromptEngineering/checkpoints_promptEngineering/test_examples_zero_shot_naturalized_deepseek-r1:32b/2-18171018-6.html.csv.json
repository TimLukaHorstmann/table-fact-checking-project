    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim about Gil Morgan is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"player gil morgan represent the united state tie for 7th place with -2 to par.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and check it against the table data.\n\n1. **Player Name**: The claim mentions \"gil morgan\" as the player. I need to find if Gil Morgan is listed in the table. Scanning through the rows, Row 10 shows a player named Gil Morgan. So that's correct.\n\n2. **Country Representation**: It says Gil represents the United States. Looking at Row 10, under the \"country\" column, it indeed lists \"united states.\" That part checks out.\n\n3. **Tie for 7th Place**: The claim mentions a tie for 7th place. In the table, the places are listed as follows: Place 1 is Tom Watson, then t2 (tied second) for Ken Brown and Lee Trevino, followed by place 4 for Ben Crenshaw, t5 for Andy Bean and Hubert Green, and then t7 starting at Row 7. Gil Morgan is in Row 10, which is part of the t7 group along with others like Isao Aoki, Sandy Lyle, Carl Mason, Jack Nicklaus, and Craig Stadler. So yes, he is tied for 7th place.\n\n4. **To Par Score**: The claim states that Gil Morgan has a \"-2\" to par score. Checking Row 10 under \"to par,\" it shows \"- 2.\" That's accurate as well.\n\nSo all parts of the claim are supported by the table: the player name, country, tied place, and to par score. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
