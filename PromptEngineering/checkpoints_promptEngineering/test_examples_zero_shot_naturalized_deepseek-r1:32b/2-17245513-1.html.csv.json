    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"t7 be the place of peter oosterhuis , who win 7500\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n1. Peter Oosterhuis's place is t7.\n2. He won $7500.\n\nI'll start by looking for Peter Oosterhuis in the table. Scanning through the rows, I find his name in Row 8. The relevant columns here are \"place\" and \"money.\"\n\nLooking at Row 8:\n- Place: t7\n- Money: 7500\n\nSo, according to the table, Peter Oosterhuis is indeed in place t7 and has a money value of $7500. \n\nNow, I need to check if both parts of the claim are correct. The first part about his place being t7 matches the table. The second part about him winning 7500 also aligns with the \"money\" column in Row 8.\n\nI should make sure there's no other row that contradicts this information, but looking through all rows, I don't see any conflicting data. Therefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Peter Oosterhuis is listed as t7 and earned $7500.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"t7 be the place of player peter oosterhuis, who have 10875\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim into two parts:\n\n1. Peter Oosterhuis is in t7 place.\n2. He has 10875 money.\n\nI need to check both of these against the table data.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- Row 7: Jack Nicklaus, Place t7, Money 7500\n- Row 8: Peter Oosterhuis, Place t7, Money 7500\n\nSo for the first part, yes, Peter is in t7. That matches.\n\nFor the second part, the claim says he has 10875 money. But according to row 8, his money is 7500. So this doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim don't hold true because while Peter is indeed in t7, he doesn't have 10875; instead, it's 7500. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states two things about Peter Oosterhuis: his place (t7) and his money (10875). Checking row 8 of the table confirms he is in t7 but shows his money as 7500, not 10875. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
