His rank is 2, but the claim refers to weeks spent at number 1, so I should check the \"weeks\" column. He has 331 weeks.\n- Nick Faldo is in row 3. Similarly, his weeks are listed as 97.\n\nThe claim says Greg Norman spent more than three times as many weeks at number 1 as Nick Faldo. So mathematically, I need to check if 3 * 97 (which is 291) is less than 331. \n\nCalculating:\n3 * 97 = 291\nGreg Norman's weeks: 331\n\nSince 331 > 291, the claim holds true.\n\nNow, I'll note the relevant cells used to verify this:\n- For Greg Norman: row 2, column \"weeks\"\n- For Nick Faldo: row 3, column \"weeks\"\n\nSo the relevant cells are rows 2 and 3 under the \"weeks\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"weeks\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"weeks\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The table lists players with their respective ranks and other details. \n\nLooking through each row:\n- Row 9: Player is Vijay Singh. His majors are listed as 3.\n- Row 11: Player is Fred Couples.

Therefore, Vijay Singh indeed has more major wins than Fred Couples. \n\nTo support this conclusion, I need to note which cells from the table were relevant. For Vijay Singh, it's row 9 and the column \"majors\". For Fred Couples, it's row 11 and the same \"majors\" column.\n\nSo, compiling this information into the required JSON format, the answer should be TRUE with the relevant cells specified.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE.

The task is to determine if the claim \"there be 3 english player on the list, 2 of whom do not win any major\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is saying. The first part states there are three English players on the list. The second part mentions that two of them have not won any majors.\n\nLooking at the table, let's identify all players from England. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 3: Nick Faldo, country: England\n- Row 5: Luke Donald, country: England\n- Row 10: Lee Westwood, country: England\n\nSo that's three English players as per the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, I need to check how many of these have zero majors. Checking each:\n\n- Nick Faldo (Row 3): Majors = 6 \u2192 He has won majors.\n- Luke Donald (Row 5): Majors = 0 \u2192 No majors.\n- Lee Westwood (Row 10): Majors = 0 \u2192 Also no majors.\n\nSo out of the three English players, two have not won any majors. This aligns with the claim that two do not win any major.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because there are exactly three English players listed (Nick Faldo, Luke Donald, and Lee Westwood), and two of them (Luke Donald and Lee Westwood) have zero majors. \n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"majors\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"majors\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"majors\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"seve ballesteros reach number 1 earlier than martin kaymer\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The phrase \"reach number 1\" likely refers to achieving the top rank in their respective categories, which could be related to weeks at number one or something similar. However, looking at the table columns: rank, player, country, weeks, order, majors. It seems that 'weeks' might indicate how many weeks they were ranked number one.\n\nSo, the claim is comparing when Seve Ballesteros and Martin Kaymer reached the top rank. If we're using 'weeks' as the measure of time spent at number one, then I need to check their respective week counts.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 4: Seve Ballesteros has 61 weeks.\n- Row 14: Martin Kaymer has 8 weeks.\n\nWait, but does a higher number of weeks mean they reached number one earlier? Or is it about when they first became number one?\n\nHmm, the table doesn't specify when each player started or when they achieved rank 1. It just shows their current rank and other stats like weeks at number one, which might be cumulative.\n\nWait, perhaps \"reach number 1\" refers to ever having been ranked number 1. The 'rank' column shows their current ranking. So Seve Ballesteros is currently rank 4, and Martin Kaymer is rank 14. But that doesn't directly answer when they reached number 1.\n\nAlternatively, the 'order' column might indicate something about their position in a different context, perhaps an ordering or another metric. But I'm not sure what 'order' signifies here.\n\nWait, maybe the 'weeks' column represents how many weeks they have been at rank 1. So Seve Ballesteros has been at number one for 61 weeks, and Martin Kaymer for only 8 weeks. This suggests that Seve spent more time at rank 1 than Martin. But does this mean he reached it earlier? Not necessarily. It could be that both were at rank 1 at different times.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'weeks' column refers to total weeks in their career, not specifically at rank 1. So maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nWait, looking back at the table structure: The columns are rank (current), player, country, weeks (maybe weeks at top?), order (not sure what this is), and majors.\n\nIn golf rankings, 'weeks' often refers to the number of weeks spent at the top position. So a higher number of weeks would mean they were at rank 1 for longer. But when did they first reach rank 1?\n\nThe table doesn't provide information about when each player reached rank 1 for the first time or how many times they achieved it. It only shows current stats.\n\nSo without data on the timeline of their rankings, I can't definitively say who reached number 1 earlier based solely on this table.\n\nWait, but maybe 'order' indicates something else. Let's see:\n\n- Seve Ballesteros has order:2\n- Martin Kaymer has order:14\n\nI'm not sure what 'order' signifies here. Maybe it's the order in which they achieved rank 1? Or perhaps their position in a different ranking system.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 'order' refers to the number of times they've been ranked 1 or some other metric.\n\nBut without knowing exactly what 'order' represents, I can't use that column reliably.\n\nGiven this ambiguity and the lack of clear data about when each player first reached rank 1, I cannot determine whether Seve Ballesteros reached number 1 earlier than Martin Kaymer based on the provided table. Therefore, the claim is not fully supported by the information given.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be verified with the available data because the table does not provide specific information about when each player first achieved rank 1. While we know their current ranks and weeks spent at number one, this doesn't indicate who reached it earlier.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"weeks\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"weeks\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The table has columns: rank, player, country, weeks, order, majors. From context, \"weeks\" likely refers to the number of weeks the player spent at the top (number 1) position. \"Order\" might be their finishing position in something, but for this claim, it's probably about how many weeks they were ranked first.\n\nThe claim is comparing Tom Lehman to other US players. So, I should look at all rows where the country is the United States and check the \"weeks\" column.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 1: Tiger Woods, USA, weeks=656\n- Row 2: Greg Norman, Australia, so not relevant\n- Row 3: Nick Faldo, England\n- Row 4: Seve Ballesteros, Spain\n- Row 5: Luke Donald, England\n- Row 6: Ian Woosnam, Wales\n- Row 7: Nick Price, Zimbabwe\n- Row 8: Rory McIlroy, Northern Ireland\n- Row 9: Vijay Singh, Fiji\n- Row 10: Lee Westwood, England\n- Row 11: Fred Couples, USA, weeks=16\n- Row 12: David Duval, USA, weeks=15\n- Row 13: Ernie Els, South Africa\n- Row 14: Martin Kaymer, Germany\n- Row 15: Bernhard Langer, West Germany\n- Row 16: Tom Lehman, USA, weeks=1\n\nSo the US players are Tiger Woods (row 1), Fred Couples (row 11), David Duval (row 12), and Tom Lehman (row 16).\n\nNow, let's list their weeks:\n\n- Tiger Woods: 656\n- Fred Couples: 16\n- David Duval: 15\n- Tom Lehman: 1\n\nThe claim says Tom Lehman spent fewer weeks than any other US player. So we need to check if his weeks (1) is less than all others.\n\nComparing:\n- 1 < 15? Yes.\n- 1 < 16? Yes.\n- 1 < 656? Yes.\n\nSo yes, Tom Lehman's 1 week is indeed the lowest among US players.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim compares two players: Greg Norman and Nick Faldo. It's saying that Greg spent less time ranked number 1 compared to Nick. So, I'm looking for the number of weeks each was at rank 1 because \"weeks\" likely refers to the duration they held that top rank.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has several columns: rank, player, country, weeks, order, and majors. The \"rank\" column shows their current or final ranking in some context (maybe overall or for a specific period). However, the claim is about being rank number 1, so I need to find how many weeks each was at that top position.\n\nWait, but looking at the table again, Greg Norman is listed as rank:2 and Nick Faldo as rank:3. But that might not be their peak ranks; perhaps the \"order\" column refers to something else, maybe their order of achievements or another ranking system? Or perhaps the \"weeks\" column indicates how many weeks they spent at rank 1.\n\nWait a minute, actually, looking more closely, each player's row shows their total weeks at rank 1. For example, Greg Norman has 331 weeks, and Nick Faldo has 97 weeks. If that's correct, then Greg spent more time as number one than Nick, which would make the claim false.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because sometimes \"weeks\" might refer to total weeks in top rankings rather than specifically rank 1. However, given the context of the claim, it's likely referring to weeks at rank 1. So Greg has 331 weeks and Nick has 97, meaning Greg spent more time, so the claim is false.\n\nWait again, perhaps I misread. Let me check each player's details:\n\n- Greg Norman: row index 2 (assuming rows are zero-based or one-based?), in any case, his \"weeks\" is 331.\n- Nick Faldo: row index 3, weeks 97.\n\nSo if the claim says Greg spent less time than Nick at rank 1, that's not true because 331 > 97. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Greg Norman spent less time ranked number one than Nick Faldo. According to the table, Greg Norman has 331 weeks and Nick Faldo has 97 weeks at rank 1.

Let's start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the term \"reach number 1\" probably refers to reaching the top rank in the rankings, which I assume is the 'rank' column in the table. So, we need to check when Seve Ballesteros and Martin Kaymer were ranked number 1.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 4 is Seve Ballesteros with rank 4.\n- Row 15 is Martin Kaymer with rank 14.\n\nWait, but neither of them has a rank of 1 in the current table. The person with rank 1 is Tiger Woods (Row 1). So does this mean that both Seve and Martin have never been ranked number 1? Or perhaps they were ranked higher in the past?\n\nThe claim says \"reach number 1 later,\" which implies that at some point, each of them was number 1. But according to the current table data, neither is currently rank 1, but we might need more information about their historical rankings.\n\nHowever, based solely on the given table, since both have ranks higher than 1, it doesn't show any instance where they were rank 1. Therefore, without additional data, we can't confirm if either ever reached number 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"order\" column represents something else. Let me check the columns again: 'rank', 'player', 'country', 'weeks', 'order', 'majors'. The 'order' might indicate their position in some other context, but it's unclear without more information.\n\nSince the claim is about reaching number 1 later than another player, and neither has a rank of 1 in this table, it seems that the necessary data isn't provided to verify when they were ranked first. Therefore, the claim cannot be supported by the given table.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe \"reach number 1\" refers to their position at some point in time, not necessarily their current rank. But without historical data or information on when each player was ranked first, we can't determine who reached it later.\n\nSo, based on the available data, there's no way to confirm whether Seve Ballesteros reached number 1 after Martin Kaymer.

So I need to check two things: how many weeks Tom Lehman was at rank 1 and compare it with the weeks of all other US players who were also at rank 1.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has information about a golfer, including their country, weeks at number 1 (weeks), and order. Wait, actually, the column named \"order\" might be a bit confusing here. I think in golf rankings, \"order of merit\" typically refers to the ranking points or something similar, not necessarily the number of weeks at rank 1. But for this problem, since the claim is about weeks at number 1, I should focus on the 'weeks' column.\n\nSo, let's identify all US players in the table and note their weeks at number 1. \n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Tiger Woods from United States has 656 weeks.\n- Row 2: Greg Norman from Australia \u2013 not a US player.\n- Row 3: Nick Faldo from England \u2013 not US.\n- Row 4: Seve Ballesteros from Spain \u2013 nope.\n- Row 5: Luke Donald from England \u2013 nope.\n- Row 6: Ian Woosnam from Wales \u2013 nope.\n- Row 7: Nick Price from Zimbabwe \u2013 nope.\n- Row 8: Rory McIlroy from Northern Ireland \u2013 not US.\n- Row 9: Vijay Singh from Fiji \u2013 nope.\n- Row 10: Lee Westwood from England \u2013 nope.\n- Row 11: Fred Couples from United States has 16 weeks.\n- Row 12: David Duval from United States has 15 weeks.\n- Row 13: Ernie Els from South Africa \u2013 nope.\n- Row 14: Martin Kaymer from Germany \u2013 nope.\n- Row 15: Bernhard Langer from West Germany \u2013 nope.\n- Row 16: Tom Lehman from United States has 1 week.\n\nSo the US players are Tiger Woods, Fred Couples, David Duval, and Tom Lehman. \n\nNow, their weeks at number 1:\n- Tiger Woods: 656 weeks\n- Fred Couples: 16 weeks\n- David Duval: 15 weeks\n- Tom Lehman: 1 week\n\nThe claim says that Tom Lehman spent more weeks at rank 1 than any other US player. But looking at the numbers, Tiger Woods has by far the most weeks (656), followed by Fred Couples and David Duval with 16 and 15 respectively. Tom Lehman only has 1 week.\n\nTherefore, Tom Lehman did NOT spend more weeks at number 1 than any other US player; in fact, he spent significantly fewer weeks. So the claim is FALSE.\n\nTo confirm this, I'll look back at the relevant cells:\n\n- For Tiger Woods: row index 0 (assuming rows start from 0), column 'weeks'.\n- Fred Couples: row 10, 'weeks'.\n- David Duval: row 11, 'weeks'.\n- Tom Lehman: row 15, 'weeks'.\n\nThese are the relevant cells that show how many weeks each US player was at rank 1. Comparing these values clearly shows that Tom Lehman's 1 week is less than the others.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"weeks\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"weeks\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"weeks\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"weeks\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
