    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"maria luisa jimenez be miss maja pilipinas in 1987 and maria muriel moral the following year\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim is saying. The first part is that Maria Luisa Jimenez was Miss Maja Pilipinas in 1987. The second part says that Maria Muriel Moral held the title the following year, which would be 1988.\n\nNow, looking at the table structure, I see that each row represents a year from 1986 to 1991. Each row has several columns: \"binibining pilipinas\", \"binibining pilipinas international\", \"miss maja pilipinas\", and others like \"tourism\" and runners-up.\n\nI need to check for the years 1987 and 1988. Let's go through each year one by one.\n\nStarting with 1987: I'll look at row 16, which is labeled as Year 1987. In this row, under \"miss maja pilipinas,\" the name listed is Maria Luisa Jimenez. That matches the first part of the claim. So that's correct.\n\nNext, for the following year, which is 1988: I look at row 17 (Year 1988). Under \"miss maja pilipinas,\" the name is Maria Muriel Moral. This matches the second part of the claim as well. \n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table. There doesn't seem to be any discrepancy here. Both Maria Luisa Jimenez and Maria Muriel Moral were Miss Maja Pilipinas in their respective years, 1987 and 1988.\n\nI should also check if there are any other relevant cells that might affect this conclusion, but from what I can see, the information is straightforward. The table clearly lists each year's awardees under the \"miss maja pilipinas\" column, so I don't think there are conflicting entries or multiple awardees in those years.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are accurately reflected in the table, and thus the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"miss maja pilipinas\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"miss maja pilipinas\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to evaluate the claim: \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism says still not part of BB Pilipinas from 1973 thru 1986.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It states that from the year 1973 up until 1986, Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism was not a part of BB Pilipinas. So I need to check each year in this range (1973-1986) and see if the \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism\" column indicates that it's still not part of BB Pilipinas.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it starts from 1973 up to 1991. Each row represents a year, and for each year, there are several columns: Binibining Pilipinas - Universe, International, Maja Pilipinas, Tourism, First Runner-up, Second Runner-up.\n\nThe column relevant here is \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism.\" The claim says that from 1973 to 1986, this category was still not part of BB Pilipinas. So for each year in that range, I need to check what the value is under this column.\n\nStarting with 1973 (Row 0), it says \"still not part of BB Pilipinas.\" Then Row 1 (1974) and Row 2 (1975) also show \"still not part of BB Pilipinas.\" This pattern continues up until Row 13, which is the year 1986. In all these rows, the Tourism column consistently says it's still not part of BB Pilipinas.\n\nTo ensure I'm thorough, let me go through each relevant row:\n\n- 1973 (Row 0): \"still not part...\"\n- 1974 (Row 1): same\n- 1975 (Row 2)\n...\nUp to 1986 (Row 13). Each of these rows shows that Tourism is still not part of BB Pilipinas.\n\nNow, I need to make sure there's no exception in this range. The last entry for the Tourism category being \"still not part...\" is in Row 13 (1986). After that, in later years like 1987 and beyond, some rows have different statuses, but since our claim stops at 1986, we don't need to consider those.\n\nSo, all the relevant cells from Row 0 through Row 13 under \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism\" confirm that it was indeed still not part of BB Pilipinas during each of those years. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure this out step by step. So, the user has given me a table with various columns related to beauty pageants, specifically Binibining Pilipinas Universe winners and their runners-up. The claim is about Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernando being the first runner-ups when Anjanette Abayari and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez won the title.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. Each row represents a year from 1986 onwards. There are several columns: Year, Binibining Pilipinas Universe, Binibining Pilipinas International, Miss Maja Pilipinas, Binibining Pilipinas Tourism, First Runner-up, and Second Runner-up.\n\nThe claim mentions two winners: Anjanette Abayari and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez. Wait, that seems a bit confusing because the title \"Binibining Pilipinas Universe\" is awarded to one person each year, right? So if both Anjanette and Maria are said to have won, that might already be an issue unless there was a co-win or some special circumstance.\n\nLooking at the table for 1991, I see two rows. The first row lists Anjanette Abayari as the Universe winner, with Selina Manalad as First Runner-up and Jennette Fernando as Second Runner-up. The second row also mentions Maria Lourdes Gonzalez as the Universe winner but has different runner-ups: Jennette as First and Selina as Second.\n\nHmm, that's conflicting. So in one row, Anjanette is the winner with Selina as first runner-up, and in another row, Maria is the winner with Jennette as first runner-up. The claim says both Anjanette and Maria won, which isn't accurate because each year only one person wins the Universe title.\n\nSo if the claim states that both Anjanette and Maria are winners when Selina and Jennette were runners-up, that's not correct based on the table. In reality, in 1991, there were two separate rows possibly indicating a split decision or maybe it's an error in the data entry. But according to the table, each of them won separately with different runner-ups.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Anjanette and Maria didn't both win the same title in the same year, and their respective runners-up are different.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both Anjanette Abayari and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez won the Binibining Pilipinas Universe in 1991 with Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernando as first runner-ups. However, examining the table for 1991 shows two separate rows where each was the sole winner of the title with different runners-up.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - universe\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - universe\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says that \"Maria Lourdes Enriquez won as Binibining Pilipinas - International the year after Jessie Alice Salones Dixson did.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. So, we're looking at two specific titles: Binibining Pilipinas and Binibining Pilipinas - International. The claim is stating that Maria Lourdes Enriquez won the International title in the year following Jessie Alice Salones Dixson's win.\n\nLooking through the table provided, I'll start by locating both names to see their respective years and titles.\n\nStarting with Jessie Alice Salones Dixson. Scanning each row for her name:\n\n- Row 15: Year 1986\n   - Binibining Pilipinas - International: Jessie Alice Salones Dixson\n\nSo, she won the International title in 1986.\n\nNext, looking for Maria Lourdes Enriquez:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 17: Year 1988\n   - Binibining Pilipinas - International: Maria Anthea Robles\n- Wait, that's not her. Let me keep going.\n- Row 16: Year 1987\n   - Binibining Pilipinas - International: Maria Lourdes Enriquez\n\nAh, there she is in row 16 for the year 1987.\n\nSo, Jessie Alice Salones Dixson won in 1986, and Maria Lourdes Enriquez won in 1987. That means Maria won the following year after Jessie. \n\nWait, but looking back at row 15: It's 1986, International is Jessie. Then row 16 is 1987 with Maria as International. So yes, she won the next year.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Maria Lourdes Enriquez became Binibining Pilipinas - International in the year after Jessie Alice Salones Dixson's win. Checking the table:\n\n- Jessie Alice Salones Dixson won Binibining Pilipinas - International in 1986 (Row 15).\n- Maria Lourdes Enriquez won the same title in 1987 (Row 16), which is the following year.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Binibining Pilipinas - International\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Binibining Pilipinas - International\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The rows are indexed starting at 0 for the first entry in 1986, and so on.\n\nLooking at Row 0 (Year 1986), under the Tourism column, it's listed as \"still not awarded.\" That means the award wasn't given that year.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"binibining pilipinas - tourism say still not part of bb pilipinas from 1973 thru 1988\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is stating that for every year from 1973 to 1988, the \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\" was not part of \"bb pilipinas.\" So, in other words, during this entire period, that particular title wasn't awarded or didn't exist within the BB Pilipinas system.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I notice that the data starts from 1973 and goes up to 1991. Each row represents a year, and each column provides information about different titles awarded in that year. The columns include \"binibining pilipinas - universe,\" \"binibining pilipinas - international,\" \"miss maja pilipinas,\" and \"binibining pilipinas - tourism.\"\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to check every relevant cell for each year between 1973 and 1988. The claim specifically mentions \"binibining pilipinas - tourism,\" so that's the column we're focusing on. For each row from 1973 up until 1988, I should look at the value in the \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\" column to see if it says \"still not part of bb pilipinas.\"\n\nLet me go through each year one by one:\n\n- **Row 0 (1973):** The cell for \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\" is empty. This might imply that the title wasn't awarded or didn't exist yet, supporting the claim.\n\n- **Row 1 (1974):** Similarly, this cell is also empty. So far, it aligns with the claim.\n\n- **Row 2 (1975):** Again, no entry here. The pattern continues.\n\nI'll continue this process up to Row 15 (1988). Checking each of these rows, I notice that in all cases from 1973 through 1988, the \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\" column is either empty or states something like \"still not part of bb pilipinas.\" \n\nWait a minute. Wait, looking more carefully, some entries actually have values. For example, in Row 16 (1987), the cell has \"marie avon boyle garcia,\" which means that year did award someone as \"binibining pilipinas - tourism.\" Similarly, in later years like 1988 and beyond, there are names listed.\n\nWait, but the claim is specifically from 1973 to 1988. So if any of those years have an entry for the tourism title, it would contradict the claim that they were \"still not part\" during that entire period.\n\nLooking back, I realize that in Row 16 (1987), there is a name listed under \"binibining pilipinas - tourism.\" This suggests that by 1987, the title was awarded and thus became part of BB Pilipinas. Therefore, the claim that it wasn't part from 1973 to 1988 isn't entirely true because in 1987, it was already awarded.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I might have made a mistake. The initial table shows that up until Row 15 (1986), the tourism title is marked as \"still not part of bb pilipinas.\" Then in Row 16 (1987), it's given to someone, meaning it became part of BB Pilipinas starting in 1987. Therefore, the claim that it was still not part from 1973 thru 1988 is partially true but not entirely because by 1987 it started being awarded.\n\nWait, no. The claim says \"still not part\" through 1988. So even if it started in 1987, the claim would be false for that year and 1988. Looking at Row 16 (1987): the tourism title is given to marie avon boyle garcia, meaning it was part of BB Pilipinas starting then. Similarly, in 1988 (Row 17), the tourism title is awarded to maritoni judith daya.\n\nTherefore, from 1987 onwards, the tourism title was part of BB Pilipinas, which contradicts the claim that it remained not part until 1988. So the claim is false because in 1987 and 1988, the tourism title was awarded as part of BB Pilipinas.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused now. Let me clarify: The claim says from 1973 thru 1988, the tourism title wasn't part of BB Pilipinas. However, in 1987 and 1988, it was awarded, meaning it became part. Therefore, the claim is not entirely true.\n\nWait again, maybe I misread the table. Let me check each row carefully:\n\n- Rows 0 to 15 (1973 to 1986): The tourism title is either empty or says \"still not part.\" So up until 1986, it wasn't awarded.\n- Row 16 (1987): Tourism title awarded to marie avon boyle garcia. So from 1987 onwards, the title was awarded as part of BB Pilipinas.\n\nTherefore, the claim is that from 1973 through 1988, the tourism title wasn't part. However, in 1987 and 1988, it was awarded. Thus, the claim is false because during those two years within the specified period, the title was indeed part of BB Pilipinas.\n\nWait, but looking back at Row 16 (1987), the tourism cell has a name, so it's no longer \"still not part.\" Therefore, the claim that from 1973 to 1988 it wasn't part is incorrect because in 1987 and 1988, it was awarded.\n\nSo my initial thought was correct: the claim isn't entirely true because starting in 1987, the tourism title became part of BB Pilipinas. Therefore, the answer should be that the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\" was not part of BB Pilipinas from 1973 through 1988 is **false**. While the tourism title wasn't awarded until 1987, by which year it became part of BB Pilipinas, and in 1988 as well, thus contradicting the claim for those years.\n\nAnswer: The claim is false.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table with various columns detailing different titles and the corresponding years they were awarded. There's also a specific claim that needs verification: \"Maria Luisa Jimenez was Miss Maja Pilipinas in 1986 and Maria Muriel Moral the following year.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n1. Maria Luisa Jimenez was Miss Maja Pilipinas in 1986.\n2. Maria Muriel Moral was Miss Maja Pilipinas in 1987.\n\nTo verify these statements, I need to look through the table provided and check each relevant cell for the years 1986 and 1987 under the \"Miss Maja Pilipinas\" column.\n\nStarting with the first part: checking if Maria Luisa Jimenez was Miss Maja Pilipinas in 1986. I'll scan through each row to find the year 1986. Looking at Row 15, which corresponds to 1986, the \"Miss Maja Pilipinas\" column lists Maria Cristiana Recto, not Maria Luisa Jimenez. This suggests that the first part of the claim might be incorrect.\n\nNext, checking the second part: Maria Muriel Moral as Miss Maja Pilipinas in 1987. I'll look for the year 1987. In Row 16, which is for 1987, the \"Miss Maja Pilipinas\" column shows Maria Luisa Jimenez. Wait, that's the same name as mentioned earlier but in a different year. This is confusing because the claim says Maria Muriel Moral was awarded in 1987, but according to Row 16, it's Maria Luisa Jimenez again.\n\nI should double-check if I missed any rows or columns. Scanning through all rows from 1980 onwards, Row 17 is for 1988, and the \"Miss Maja Pilipinas\" there is Maria Muriel Moral. That would mean she was awarded in 1988, not 1987 as the claim states.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n- For 1986 (Row 15), Miss Maja Pilipinas is Maria Cristiana Recto.\n- For 1987 (Row 16), it's Maria Luisa Jimenez.\n- Maria Muriel Moral appears in 1988 (Row 17).\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Maria Luisa Jimenez was awarded in 1986 and Maria Muriel Moral in 1987. Both the names and the years don't match up as per the table.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells to check are:\n- Row 15 (1986) under \"Miss Maja Pilipinas.\"\n- Row 16 (1987) under \"Miss Maja Pilipinas.\"\n- Row 17 (1988) under \"Miss Maja Pilipinas.\"\n\nSince the claim doesn't align with the data in these cells, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Maria Luisa Jimenez was Miss Maja Pilipinas in 1986 and Maria Muriel Moral in 1987.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table data. The claim says: \"Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernando were the second runner-ups when Anjanette Abayari and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez won Binibining Pilipinas Universe.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down what this means. The claim mentions two events where specific women won the universe title, and in both cases, Selina and Jennette were their respective second runners-up.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find rows where either Anjanette Abayari or Maria Lourdes Gonzalez are listed under the \"binibining pilipinas - universe\" column. Then, check if in those same rows, Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernando are listed as second runner-ups.\n\nStarting with Anjanette Abayari: I scan through the table until I find her name. Looking at row 20, it says:\n\n- binibining pilipinas - universe: anjanette abayari\n- first runner-up: selina manalad\n- second runner-up: jennette fernando\n\nWait, no. The claim is about them being second runners-up when Anjanette and Maria won. But in row 20, Anjanette Abayari is the universe winner, Selina Manalad is first runner-up, and Jennette is second.\n\nSo that doesn't match because the claim says both are second runner-ups for each winner. Maybe I missed something else.\n\nNow checking for Maria Lourdes Gonzalez: She appears in row 21 as the universe winner. In that same row:\n\n- binibining pilipinas - universe: maria lourdes gonzalez\n- first runner-up: jennette fernando\n- second runner-up: anna marie torres\n\nHmm, so Selina isn't even mentioned here. She's not the second runner-up for Maria Lourdes; instead, Jennette is the first runner-up.\n\nSo according to this, when Anjanette won (row 20), Selina was first and Jennette was second. When Maria Lourdes won (row 21), Jennette was first and someone else was second. Therefore, the claim that both were second runners-up for each of these winners is incorrect.\n\nWait, but row 20 shows Anjanette as universe winner, Selina as first runner-up, Jennette as second. So the claim says Selina and Jennette are the second runners-up when those two won. But according to the table, only Jennette was a second runner-up for Anjanette, not both.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check again:\n\nRow 20:\n- universe: anjanette abayari\n- first runner-up: selina manalad\n- second runner-up: jennette fernando\n\nSo Selina is first runner-up here, Jennette is second.\n\nRow 21:\n- universe: maria lourdes gonzalez\n- first runner-up: jennette fernando\n- second runner-up: anna marie torres\n\nHere, Selina isn't listed as a runner-up. So the claim that both were second runners-up when each won doesn't hold because in Anjanette's win, Selina was first and Jennette second. In Maria Lourdes' win, Jennette was first and someone else was second. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nSo the relevant cells are row 20 for Anjanette's win showing Selina as first and Jennette as second, and row 21 where Maria Lourdes won with Jennette as first. Thus, the claim isn't supported because Selina wasn't a second runner-up in either case when these two were winners.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - universe\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"first runner-up\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"second runner-up\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - universe\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"first runner-up\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "binibining pilipinas - tourism do not start not until the year 1989",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"binibining pilipinas - tourism do not start until the year 1989\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll understand what the claim is saying. It states that the category of Binibining Pilipinas (Miss Philippines) titled \"Tourism\" didn't exist before 1989 and started in that year. So, to verify this, I need to look through each row of the table provided and check when the \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism\" column first appears with a non-null or non-default value.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a year from 1987 onwards (rows 16 to 21). Each row has columns for different categories: Binibining Pilipinas Universe, International, Maja Pilipinas, Tourism, and Runners-up. The claim is specifically about the Tourism category.\n\nI'll start by examining each row's \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism\" column:\n\n- Row 16 (1987): The value here is \"marie avon boyle garcia\". This indicates that someone was awarded in the Tourism category, which contradicts the claim that it started only in 1989.\n\nWait a minute, that's conflicting. If the Tourism title was given in 1987, then the claim that it started in 1989 is false. Let me check other rows to ensure consistency.\n\n- Row 17 (1988): The value is \"maritoni judith daya\". Again, someone is listed here under Tourism.\n- Row 18 (1989): The claim states it starts here, but the prior years already have entries. So this further supports that the Tourism category existed before 1989.\n\nWait, maybe I need to double-check if these are correct or perhaps misread. Let me go through each year:\n\n- Row 16: Year 1987 \u2013 Tourism has a name.\n- Row 17: Year 1988 \u2013 Tourism has another name.\n- Rows 18 onwards (1989 to 1991): Tourism continues with different names.\n\nThis indicates that the Tourism category was present in 1987 and 1988, which is earlier than 1989. Therefore, the claim that it started in 1989 is incorrect.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are from row 16 onwards where Tourism has entries prior to 1989.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism\" category was awarded as early as 1987, which is before 1989. The relevant cells showing these awards include rows from 1987 (row 16) and subsequent years.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "maria lourdes enriquez lose as binibining pilipinas - international the year after jessie alice salones dixson do",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"maria lourdes enriquez lose as binibining pilipinas - international the year after jessie alice salones dixson do.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this means. It seems to suggest that Maria Lourdes Enriquez lost her title (as Binibining Pilipinas International) the year following Jessie Alice Salones Dixson's win or involvement in the same category.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year from 1980 to 1991. The columns include \"binibining pilipinas - international,\" which I assume is the titleholder for that category each year.\n\nI need to find out when Jessie Alice Salones Dixson was Binibining Pilipinas International and then check if Maria Lourdes Enriquez was in the same position the following year, losing it or not.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- In 1986 (Row 15), Jessie Alice Salones Dixson is listed as Binibining Pilipinas International.\n- The next year would be 1987 (Row 16). Checking that row, Maria Lourdes Enriquez is indeed listed as Binibining Pilipinas International in 1987.\n\nNow, the claim says that Maria Lourdes Enriquez \"lose\" the title. Since she won it in 1987, unless there's information about her losing it later, we need to check if she retained the title or lost it in subsequent years.\n\nLooking at 1988 (Row 17), the Binibining Pilipinas International is Maria Anthea Robles. This means Maria Lourdes Enriquez did not retain the title the year after she won; instead, someone else took over. Therefore, it seems like she lost the title in 1988.\n\nHowever, the claim specifically mentions that this happened \"the year after\" Jessie Alice Salones Dixson's involvement. Since Jessie was in 1986, Maria Lourdes Enriquez was in 1987 and then not in 1988. So the loss would have been in 1988.\n\nBut wait, does the claim say she lost it in the year after Jessie's win? The wording is a bit unclear. It could mean that Maria Lourdes Enriquez lost the title the year following Jessie's involvement, which was 1986. So the next year would be 1987. But in 1987, she won it, not lost it.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. The claim says Maria Lourdes Enriquez \"lose as Binibining Pilipinas International\" the year after Jessie did so. So if Jessie was in 1986, then Maria Lourdes Enriquez would have been in 1987, and she lost it that same year? Or perhaps she held it in 1987 but lost it in 1988.\n\nWait, the claim says \"lose as Binibining Pilipinas - international the year after jessie alice salones dixson do.\" So if Jessie was in 1986, then Maria Lourdes Enriquez would have been the next one in 1987. But did she lose it that same year? Or did she hold it until 1988 when someone else took over.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is saying that Maria Lourdes Enriquez lost the title the year after Jessie held it. So if Jessie was in 1986, then Maria would have been in 1987 but didn't retain it in 1988.\n\nWait, looking back at the table:\n\n- 1986: Jessie Alice Salones Dixson\n- 1987: Maria Lourdes Enriquez\n- 1988: Maria Anthea Robles\n\nSo Maria Lourdes Enriquez was Binibining Pilipinas International in 1987 and didn't hold it in 1988. So she \"lost\" the title in 1988, which is the year after Jessie's term.\n\nBut does the claim specify that Maria lost it in 1987 or 1988? The wording is a bit ambiguous. It says \"lose as Binibining Pilipinas - international the year after jessie alice salones dixson do.\" So if Jessie was in 1986, then the next year is 1987. In 1987, Maria Lourdes Enriquez won it, so she didn't lose it that year; rather, she held it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"lose\" refers to her not retaining it for the following year, meaning she lost it in 1988, which is the year after 1987. But the claim specifically mentions the year after Jessie's involvement, which was 1986, so that would be 1987.\n\nIn 1987, Maria Lourdes Enriquez won the title, so she didn't lose it in 1987; she gained it. Therefore, the claim might not hold because she didn't lose it the year after Jessie's term but rather held it and then lost it the following year.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The claim says Maria Lourdes Enriquez lost the title in the year after Jessie's involvement. So if Jessie was in 1986, Maria would have been in 1987. If she lost it in that same year (1987), but according to the table, she held it until 1987 and then someone else took over in 1988.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"lose\" refers to not retaining it for the next year, which would be true because she didn't hold it in 1988. But does that mean she lost it in 1988, which is the year after Jessie's term?\n\nWait, no, the claim says \"the year after jessie alice salones dixson do.\" So if Jessie was in 1986, then Maria would have been in 1987. If she lost it that same year (1987), but according to the table, she held it until the end of 1987.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding \"lose\" here. Maybe it refers to her not retaining it for the next year. So in 1986, Jessie was there, then Maria in 1987, and then someone else in 1988. Therefore, Maria didn't lose it in 1987; she lost it in 1988.\n\nBut the claim says \"the year after jessie.\" So if Jessie was in 1986, the next year is 1987. In that case, Maria Lourdes Enriquez won it in 1987, so she didn't lose it; she gained it. Therefore, the claim might be incorrect because she didn't lose it the year after Jessie's term but rather held it and then lost it the following year.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is that Maria Lourdes Enriquez lost her title in 1987, which would mean she was Binibining Pilipinas International in 1986 and someone else took over in 1987. But according to the table, Jessie was in 1986, so that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if Maria Lourdes Enriquez was Binibining Pilipinas International in any other year besides 1987. Looking through the table:\n\n- 1980: Norma Andaya\n- 1981: Teresita de Jesus\n- 1982: Rosario Villaruel\n- 1983: Leticia C. Agbayani\n- 1984: Lourdes Ocampo\n- 1985: Maria Angeles Palad\n- 1986: Jessie Alice Salones Dixson\n- 1987: Maria Lourdes Enriquez\n- 1988: Maria Anthea Robles\n- 1989: Susana Cloribeth Natividad\n- 1990: Mary Ann C. Ong\n- 1991: Maricar Reyes\n\nSo Maria Lourdes Enriquez is only listed in 1987. Therefore, she held the title that year and didn't hold it in 1988. So if someone asks whether she lost it the year after Jessie's term (1986), then yes, in 1987 she won it, but the following year, 1988, she didn't hold it anymore.\n\nWait, but the claim says she \"lose\" as Binibining Pilipinas International the year after Jessie. So that would be in 1987. But she held it in 1987 and lost it in 1988.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the claim is incorrect because she didn't lose it in 1987 but rather held it until 1987 and then lost it in 1988.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term \"lose\" refers to not retaining it for the next year. In that case, yes, she didn't retain it, so she lost it in 1988, which is the year after 1987, but the claim mentions the year after Jessie's term, which was 1986.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the claim is incorrect because she held the title in 1987 and then lost it in 1988, not in the year immediately following Jessie's term (which would be 1987).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\n- Jessie was Binibining Pilipinas International in 1986.\n\n- The next year, 1987, Maria Lourdes Enriquez held it.\n\n- Therefore, the year after Jessie's term (1986) is 1987, when Maria held it. So she didn't lose it that year; she gained it.\n\nTherefore, the claim that she lost it the year after Jessie's term would be incorrect because she actually won it in 1987 and then lost it in 1988.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is referring to a different event or misunderstanding the timeline. But based on the table, Maria Lourdes Enriquez was the titleholder in 1987, so she didn't lose it that year; she held it until then.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Maria Lourdes Enriquez lost her title as Binibining Pilipinas International the year after Jessie Alice Salones Dixson's term. However, according to the timeline:\n\n- **1986**: Jessie Alice Salones Dixson was the Binibining Pilipinas International.\n- **1987**: Maria Lourdes Enriquez held the title.\n- **1988**: The title passed to another recipient.\n\nThis indicates that Maria Lourdes Enriquez won the title in 1987, not lost it. She retained the title until the end of her term in 1987 and did not lose it during that year. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because she gained the title in 1987 rather than losing it.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is incorrect because Maria Lourdes Enriquez won the Binibining Pilipinas International title in 1987, following Jessie Alice Salones Dixson's term in 1986. She did not lose the title that year but held it until the end of her term in 1987.",
