Scanning through all rows, it appears that only Row 13 mentions a player from Zimbabwe\u2014Nick Price.

Each row represents a different player with their respective details like place, country, score, to par, and money earned. My main focus here is on the \"player\" and \"money\" columns because the claim is about Mark Brooks earning the most.\n\nLooking at Row 1: It says the player is \"mark brooks\" (I think that's a typo for Mark Brooks) with a money value of $430,000. That seems like a significant amount. Let me check other players' money to compare.\n\nRow 2: Kenny Perry has $260,000, which is less than Mark's $430k.\nRows 3 and 4: Steve Elkington and Tommy Tolles both have $140,000 each.\nRows 5,6,7: Justin Leonard, Jesper Parnevik, Vijay Singh each have about $86,667. That's even lower.\nRows 8-13: The players here all have $57,500. So the highest among them is still less than Mark Brooks.\n\nComparing all these, Mark Brooks indeed has the highest money value of $430,000. There's no other player in the table with a higher amount.

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two players: Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry. It says they tie for having the lowest \"to par.\" I remember that in golf, \"to par\" refers to how many strokes a player is above or below the standard score (par) for the course. A lower number here would mean better performance because it indicates being further below par.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a column called \"to par.\" The values are like \"-11,\" \"-10,\" etc. So I need to check what Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry's \"to par\" scores are.\n\nLet me scan through the rows:\n\nRow 1: Mark Brooks, to par is -11.\nRow 2: Kenny Perry, to par is also -11.\nRows 3 and 4: Steve Elkington and Tommy Tolles have -10 each.\nRows 5-7: Justin Leonard, Jesper Parnevik, Vijay Singh all have -9.\nRows 8-13: Players like Lee Janzen, Phil Mickelson, etc., have -8.\n\nSo the \"to par\" scores start from -11 and go up. The lower the number, the better because it's more negative (further below par). So Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry are both at -11, which is the lowest in the table. That means they tie for the best performance relative to par.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there are any other players with -11 besides them. Looking through the rows, only Rows 1 and 2 have -11. So yes, they are tied at the top (lowest \"to par\") together.\n\nSo the claim is correct: Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry tie for having the lowest to par. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry share the lowest \"to par\" score.

It states that Kenny Perry earned $170,000 less than Mark Brooks. To verify this, I'll need to find the earnings of both players from the table and calculate the difference.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Place 1, Player Mark Brooks, Money: 430,000.\nSo, Mark Brooks earned $430,000.\n\nNext, checking Row 2: Place 2, Player Kenny Perry, Money: 260,000.\nKenny Perry earned $260,000.\n\nNow, I'll compute the difference between their earnings. Subtracting Kenny's money from Mark's gives:\n430,000 - 260,000 = 170,000.\n\nThe result is exactly $170,000.

It states that Kenny Perry earned more money than any other player in the table. To verify this, I need to look at each player's 'money' column and compare their earnings.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n- Each row represents a player with details like place, name, country, score, to par, and money.\n- The 'money' column shows the amount each player earned in dollars.\n\nI'll go through each row and note down the players along with their respective money:\n\n1. Mark Brooks: $430,000\n2. Kenny Perry: $260,000\n3. Steve Elkington: $140,000\n4. Tommy Tolles: $140,000\n5. Justin Leonard: ~$86,667 (since it's split among t5 players)\n6.

Nick Price: $57,500\n\nFrom this list, Mark Brooks has the highest amount at $430,000, followed by Kenny Perry with $260,000. Since $260,000 is less than $430,000, Kenny Perry does not earn the most money among all players listed.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Mark Brooks earned more than Kenny Perry.

Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and check which players are listed as being from New Zealand. Scanning through each row, I see that Row 12 has a player named Frank Nobilo from New Zealand. \n\nNow, I need to verify if there are any other players from New Zealand in the table. Going through each row again, Rows 1 to 13 don't mention any other New Zealand players besides Frank Nobilo. Each of these rows lists players from countries like United States, Australia, Sweden, Fiji, and Zimbabwe.\n\nSince Frank Nobilo is the only player from New Zealand listed, the claim that he's the sole representative from his country holds true according to the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_12\", \"country\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nWait, but looking back at the instructions, I need to specify row indexes starting from 0, and column names as strings. Also, in the JSON, it's a list of objects with \"row_index\" and \"column_name\".\n\nLet me correct that.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nWait no, the row indexes are from 0 to 13? Let me check. The table has rows from Row 1 to Row 13. But in programming terms, often indexes start at 0. So if the first row is Row 1, then its index would be 0.\n\nBut in the problem statement, each row starts with \"Row 1:\", so I think the row indices are 1-based. Therefore, Row 12 would have an index of 12-1=11?\n\nWait no, wait, let me clarify:\n\nThe table is given as follows:\nRow 1: place: 1, player: mark brooks, country: united states, score: 68 + 70 + 69 + 70 = 277, to par: - 11, money: 430000.\n...\nRow 12: place: t8, player: frank nobilo, country: new zealand, ...\n\nIn the problem statement, each row is labeled as Row 1, Row 2, etc. So when referring to these rows in the JSON response, should I use 1-based or 0-based indices?\n\nThe example given in the instructions shows:\n\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"\n\nSo it's using 0-based indexing.\n\nThus, Row 1 is index 0, Row 2 is index 1, ..., Row 13 would be index 12.\n\nFrank Nobilo is in Row 12 of the problem statement, which would correspond to row_index: 11 (since Row 1 is 0).\n\nWait no. Let me count:\n\nRow 1: index 0\nRow 2: index 1\n...\nRow 12: index 11\nRow 13: index 12\n\nSo Frank Nobilo is in Row 12, which is row_index:11.\n\nBut looking back at the table, the last row (Row 13) is Nick Price from Zimbabwe. So in the problem statement's naturalized format, there are 13 rows (Rows 1 to 13). Therefore, when converting to JSON, they should be indexed from 0 to 12.\n\nThus, Frank Nobilo is in Row 12 of the problem statement, which would be row_index:11 in the JSON response. However, checking again, the user provided a table with rows 1 through 13 (as per the naturalized format given), but when translating into zero-based indices, we have to adjust accordingly.\n\nWait no. Wait, looking back at the problem statement's table:\n\nIt starts with Row 1: ..., then Row 2: ..., up to Row 13: ... So there are 13 rows in total. Therefore, if I'm using zero-based indexing for row_index, Row 1 is index 0, Row 2 is index 1, and so on until Row 13 is index 12.\n\nFrank Nobilo is in Row 12 of the problem statement's table, which would be row_index:11 (since 12-1=11). But looking at the table again:\n\nWait no. Wait the problem says:\n\nRow 12: place: t8, player: frank nobilo, country: new zealand...\n\nSo Row 12 is one of the rows in the naturalized format.\n\nThus, in the JSON response, we need to indicate that row as index 11 (since it's zero-based). So:\n\n{\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n\nBut wait, let me recount:\n\nRow 1: 0\nRow 2: 1\n...\nRow 12: 11\n\nYes.\n\nSo the JSON should be:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut wait, the initial thought process concluded that Frank Nobilo is in Row 12 (naturalized format), which would be row_index:11. However, upon closer examination, the table as given in the problem statement has rows from Row 1 to Row 13. Therefore, when converting to zero-based indexing for the JSON response, Row 12 becomes index 11.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Therefore, Frank Nobilo isn't even from Zimbabwe; he's from New Zealand.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake? Let me look again. The claim is \"frank nobilo be the only player from zimbabwe.\" So according to the table, Frank Nobilo is from New Zealand (Row 12), and Nick Price is from Zimbabwe (Row 13). Therefore, there's at least one other player from Zimbabwe besides Frank Nobilo\u2014Nick Price. But wait, actually, Frank isn't from Zimbabwe; he's from New Zealand.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"kenny perry earn 170000 more than mark brook\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has rows numbered from 1 to 13, each containing details about different players: their place, name, country, score, to par, and money earned. The claim mentions Kenny Perry and Mark Brooks, so my first step is to locate these two players in the table.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Player is Mark Brooks.\n- Row 2: Player is Kenny Perry.\n\nSo, both are present in the table. Now, I need to check their respective earnings. The column that indicates money earned is labeled as \"money.\"\n\nFor Mark Brooks (Row 1), the money earned is listed as $430,000. For Kenny Perry (Row 2), it's $260,000.\n\nThe claim states that Kenny Perry earns $170,000 more than Mark Brooks. To verify this, I'll subtract Mark Brooks' earnings from Kenny Perry's:\n\n$260,000 (Kenny) - $430,000 (Mark) = -$170,000.\n\nThis shows that Kenny actually earns $170,000 less than Mark. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states the opposite\u2014implying Kenny earns more when in reality he earns less.\n\nAdditionally, I need to ensure that there are no other rows or columns that might affect this conclusion. However, since both players are clearly listed with their earnings and the difference is straightforward, there's no ambiguity here.\n\nSo, based on the table data, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"money\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
