    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about the most viewed episode of season 1 of \"Gary Unmarried\" is true or false. The claim says that the most viewed episode was titled \"Gary and Allison Brooks.\" \n\nFirst, let me look at the table provided. Each row represents an episode with details like title, air date, timeslot, 18-49 rating, and viewers. There are 20 rows, so season 1 probably has 20 episodes.\n\nThe key part here is to find out which episode had the highest number of viewers. The column I need to focus on is \"viewers.\" Each row has a value in this column, so I should go through each one and identify the maximum.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 1: 6.84 million viewers\nRow 2: 6.97 million\nRow 3: 7.43 million\nRow 4: 7.71 million\nRow 5: 7.85 million\nRow 6: 6.44 million\nRow 7: 6.71 million\nRow 8: 8.14 million\nRow 9: 7.72 million\nRow 10: 8.03 million\nRow 11: 7.55 million\nRow 12: 7.07 million\nRow 13: 7.07 million\nRow 14: 6.86 million\nRow 15: 7.26 million\nRow 16: 7.71 million\nRow 17: 7.57 million\nRow 18: 7.3 million\nRow 19: 6.66 million\nRow 20: 5.55 million\n\nNow, scanning through these numbers, the highest I see is 8.14 million in row 8, titled \"Gary and Allison Brooks.\" That seems to be higher than all others. The next closest are rows 5 (7.85), 10 (8.03). Wait, row 10 has 8.03 which is less than 8.14, so row 8 is indeed the highest.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any higher numbers elsewhere. Scanning again: rows 3-5 have 7.43, 7.71, 7.85; then row 8 jumps up to 8.14. The rest are lower or similar. So yes, row 8 has the highest viewers.\n\nNow, looking at the claim, it specifically mentions that \"Gary and Allison Brooks\" is the most viewed. Since this episode is in row 8 with 8.14 million viewers, which is higher than all others, the claim holds true.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the ones where viewership was checked, especially focusing on the highest value in row 8.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"viewers\"}\n   ]\n}",

I need to determine whether the claim about the TV show \"Gary Unmarried\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table data.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"In season 1 of Gary Unmarried, the least viewed episode of the season was the finale, which aired on May 20, 2009.\" So, I need to check two things:\n\n1. Which episode is the finale? According to the table, the episodes are listed in order from September 24, 2008, to May 20, 2009. The last row (Row 20) has an air date of May 20, 2009, so that's likely the finale.\n\n2. Is this episode indeed the least viewed? I need to compare the viewers for all episodes and see if Row 20 has the lowest number.\n\nLooking at each row:\n- Row 1: 6.84 million\n- Row 2: 6.97 million\n- Row 3: 7.43 million\n- Row 4: 7.71 million\n- Row 5: 7.85 million\n- Row 6: 6.44 million\n- Row 7: 6.71 million\n- Row 8: 8.14 million\n- Row 9: 7.72 million\n- Row 10: 8.03 million\n- Row 11: 7.55 million\n- Row 12: 7.07 million\n- Row 13: 7.07 million\n- Row 14: 6.86 million\n- Row 15: 7.26 million\n- Row 16: 7.71 million\n- Row 17: 7.57 million\n- Row 18: 7.30 million (wait, it's written as \"7.3\", but in the table it says viewers=7.3)\nWait, looking back, I see that for Row 20, viewers are 5.55 million.\n\nComparing all, the lowest is indeed 5.55 million in Row 20, which matches the claim's date of May 20, 2009.

The \"timeslot\" column shows when each episode was scheduled to air.\n\nI should check every single entry in the \"timeslot\" column to ensure they all say \"Wednesday 8:30 pm.\" \n\nStarting from Row 1: Pilot episode's timeslot is Wednesday 8:30 PM. That matches.\nRow 2: Gary gets boundaries \u2013 same timeslot.\nRows 3,4,5: All have the same timeslot. So far so good.\n\nContinuing through the table:\nRow 6: Gary meets the gang \u2013 still Wednesday 8:30 PM.\nRow 7: Same as above.\nRow 8: Still consistent.\nRow 9: Also correct.\n\nRows 10,11: All show Wednesday at 8:30.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"4 episode titles of Gary Unmarried feature the name of both Gary and Allison in season 1.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's talking about episode titles from Season 1 of a show called Gary Unmarried. Specifically, it claims that four episodes have both Gary and Allison's names in their titles.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with its title under the \"episode\" column. I need to go through each episode title and check if both \"Gary\" and \"Allison\" are present in the title. \n\nLet me list out all the episode titles:\n\n1. Pilot\n2. Gary gets boundaries\n3. Gary marries off his ex\n4. Gary gets his stuff back\n5. Gary breaks up his ex-wife and girlfriend\n6. Gary meets the gang\n7. Gary and Allison's restaurant\n8. Gary and Allison Brooks\n9. Gary gives thanks\n10. Gary goes first\n11. Gary toughens up Tom\n12. Gary dates Louise's teacher\n13. Gary moves back in\n14. Gary and Dennis' sister\n15. Gary's ex-brother-in-law\n16. Gary uses his veto\n17. Gary hooks up Allison\n18. Gary and the trophy\n19. Gary and his half brother\n20. Gary fixes Allison's garbage disposal\n\nNow, I'll go through each episode title to see if both \"Gary\" and \"Allison\" are in them.\n\n- Episode 1: Pilot - Only mentions Gary (as it's about Gary Unmarried), but no Allison.\n- Episode 2: Gary gets boundaries - Only Gary.\n- Episode 3: Gary marries off his ex - Only Gary.\n- Episode 4: Gary gets his stuff back - Only Gary.\n- Episode 5: Gary breaks up his ex-wife and girlfriend - Only Gary.\n- Episode 6: Gary meets the gang - Only Gary.\n- Episode 7: Gary and Allison's restaurant - Both names present.\n- Episode 8: Gary and Allison Brooks - Both names present. (Note: Allison is part of a full name here.)\n- Episode 9: Gary gives thanks - Only Gary.\n- Episode 10: Gary goes first - Only Gary.\n- Episode 11: Gary toughens up Tom - Only Gary.\n- Episode 12: Gary dates Louise's teacher - Only Gary.\n- Episode 13: Gary moves back in - Only Gary.\n- Episode 14: Gary and Dennis' sister - Only Gary (Dennis is another person).\n- Episode 15: Gary's ex-brother-in-law - Only Gary.\n- Episode 16: Gary uses his veto - Only Gary.\n- Episode 17: Gary hooks up Allison - Both names present. (Here, Allison is the second part.)\n- Episode 18: Gary and the trophy - Only Gary.\n- Episode 19: Gary and his half brother - Only Gary.\n- Episode 20: Gary fixes Allison's garbage disposal - Both names present.\n\nSo, looking at these, episodes 7, 8, 17, and 20 have both \"Gary\" and \"Allison\" in their titles. That makes four episodes as the claim states.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check episode 8: \"Gary and Allison Brooks.\" Here, Allison is part of a full name (Allison Brooks), so it's still including Allison's name. Similarly, episode 20 mentions \"Allison's,\" which clearly includes her name.\n\nEpisodes that qualify:\n- Episode 7\n- Episode 8\n- Episode 17\n- Episode 20\n\nThat's four episodes. So the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as there are four episodes in Season 1 where both Gary and Allison's names appear in the episode titles.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"episode\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The phrase seems a bit off, but I think it's trying to say that Gary's show airs every Friday at 8:00 PM. Alternatively, maybe it's about an episode titled \"Gary Unmarried\" airing on Friday at 8 PM.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with its air date and timeslot. The timeslot for all episodes is listed as Wednesday 8:30 PM. So, none of them are scheduled on Friday or at 8:00 PM.\n\nI should check if any episode has a different timeslot. Scanning through the rows, each one consistently shows \"wednesday 8:30 pm\" under the timeslot column. There's no mention of Friday or a different time like 8:00 PM.\n\nAlso, regarding the title part, \"gary unmarried come on friday...\"\u2014the closest episode titles are about Gary getting boundaries, marrying off his ex, etc., but there isn't an episode named \"Gary Unmarried.\"\n\nSo, based on the table, all episodes air every Wednesday at 8:30 PM.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"there be only 2 new episode of gary unmarried in december 2009\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is saying. It's stating that there are only two new episodes of \"Gary Unmarried\" aired in December 2009. \n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents an episode with details like air date, timeslot, ratings, and viewers. My goal is to check how many episodes were aired in December 2009.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one and note down the episodes that have their air dates in December 2008 or December 2009 because the claim mentions December 2009, but I should verify if there are any entries from 2009.\n\nStarting with Row 1: Air date is September 24, 2008. That's not December 2009.\nRow 2: October 1, 2008. Nope.\nRow 3: October 8, 2008. Still not in December 2009.\nRow 4: October 15, 2008. Not relevant.\nRow 5: October 22, 2008. Moving on.\nRow 6: November 5, 2008. Closer but still November 2008.\nRow 7: November 12, 2008. Also not December 2009.\nRow 8: November 19, 2008. Still in 2008.\nRow 9: November 26, 2008. Not relevant.\n\nNow, Row 10: December 10, 2008. That's December but in 2008, so not matching the claim's year of 2009.\nRow 11: December 17, 2008. Again, 2008.\n\nContinuing to Row 12 onwards:\n\nLooking through Rows 12-16, I don't see any air dates in December 2009. Each of these entries fall into March or April 2009 at the latest.\n\nRow 17: March 18, 2009.\nRow 18: April 8, 2009.\nRow 19: May 6, 2009.\nRow 20: May 20, 2009.\n\nI don't find any episodes with air dates in December 2009. The last few entries are all in 2009 but not December. \n\nSo, the claim is that there were only two new episodes in December 2009, but according to the table, there are no episodes aired in December 2009 at all. Therefore, the statement is incorrect because it's claiming two episodes when there were actually zero.\n\nThe relevant cells I checked are Rows 10 and 11 for their air dates in December 2008, but since the claim is about 2009, these don't support the claim. However, they help confirm that any December entries are from 2008.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_10\", \"air date\"}, {\"row_11\", \"air date\"}]}\n\nBut since I need to format it correctly with row indices starting at 0 and correct column names:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"air date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"air date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nWait, but the claim is about December 2009. In the table, all December dates are in 2008 (rows 10 and 11). So there's no December 2009 entries, meaning zero episodes. Therefore, the claim of two episodes being aired in December 2009 is false.\n\nSo, the relevant cells checked are rows with air date in December 2008:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"air date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"air date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut to be precise, the claim refers to December 2009, which isn't present in the table. So actually, there are no relevant cells that support the claim as all December entries are from 2008.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any rows have air date in December 2009:\n\nLooking through all 20 rows, none of them have air dates in 2009 beyond May. So, there's no row with a December 2009 air date.\n\nHence, the claim is FALSE because there are zero episodes in December 2009, not two.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be all rows where the air date is in December, but since none are in 2009, perhaps no relevant cells? But to confirm that, I have to check each row's air date. So all rows from 0 to 19 were checked for their air dates.\n\nBut perhaps only the ones with air dates close to December 2008 and any possible 2009 entries.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to list all rows where air date is in December:\n\nRow indices 9 (Dec 10, 2008) and 10 (Dec 17, 2008). So these are the only two rows with December dates, but they're in 2008.\n\nSo the claim refers to December 2009, which has zero episodes. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\nBut according to instructions, I should list all cells relevant to verify the claim. Since the claim talks about episodes in December 2009, and none are present, perhaps the relevant cells are rows with air date in December (to confirm there's no 2009 entries). So rows 9 and 10.\n\nFinal JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"air date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"air date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut since the claim is about December 2009 and there are no such entries, perhaps it's better to state that. So, the correct answer is FALSE.\n\nThe step-by-step explanation:\n\n- The user claims two episodes were aired in December 2009.\n- Checked all rows for air dates in December 2009; none found.\n- Therefore, the claim is false as there are zero episodes in December 2009.\n- Relevant cells: Rows with air date in December (rows 9 and 10), which are from 2008.\n\nFinal JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"air date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"air date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut actually, according to the table, there are no December 2009 entries. So the correct answer is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure all rows are checked:\n\nRows 0-19: All air dates are either in 2008 (up to May 2009). No December 2009 entries.\n\nSo the claim of two episodes in Dec 2009 is false because there are none. Hence, the answer is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells would be rows with air date in December, which are from 2008 (rows 9 and 10), to confirm no Dec 2009 entries exist.\n\nSo the correct JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"air date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"air date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nFinal Answer: The claim is FALSE because there are no episodes in December 2009.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"air date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"air date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut perhaps the relevant cells should include all rows where air date is in December to confirm there's no 2009 entries. Since it's a bit ambiguous, but as per instructions, list all cells that were checked for the claim.\n\nThus, listing only rows with December air dates (rows 9 and 10), which are in 2008.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"air date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"air date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nYes, this is correct.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"the final episode have the second least view and air may 6\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n1. The final episode has the second least viewers.\n2. The final episode aired on May 6.\n\nI'll start by identifying which row corresponds to the final episode. Looking at the table, there are 20 rows, so the last one is Row 20. \n\nNow, checking the details for Row 20:\n- Episode: \"gary fixes allison's garbage disposal\"\n- Air Date: May 20, 2009\n- Viewers: 5.55\n\nNext, I'll analyze the viewership across all episodes to find out if Row 20 indeed has the second least views.\n\nLooking at the 'viewers' column:\n- The lowest number is in Row 20 with 5.55.\n- Let's list all the viewer numbers in ascending order to determine the ranking:\n1. 5.55 (Row 20)\n2. 6.44 (Row 6)\n3. 6.66 (Row 19)\n4. 6.71 (Row 7)\n5. 6.84 (Row 1)\n6. 6.86 (Row 14)\n7. 6.97 (Row 2)\n8. 7.07 (Rows 12 and 13)\n9. 7.26 (Row 15)\n10. 7.3 (Row 18)\n11. 7.43 (Row 3)\n12. 7.55 (Row 11)\n13. 7.57 (Row 17)\n14. 7.71 (Rows 4 and 6)\nWait, I think I made a mistake here because Row 4 has viewers:7.71 and Row 16 also has 7.71. So actually, the list should continue beyond that.\n\nBut from this, it's clear that Row 20 has the lowest viewer count at 5.55, which would make it the first least, not the second. The next lowest is 6.44 in Row 6. Therefore, the claim that it's the second least isn't accurate\u2014it's actually the least.\n\nAdditionally, checking the air date for Row 20: it's May 20, 2009, not May 6. Looking at other rows, I see Row 19 has an air date of May 6, 2009. So the final episode didn't air on May 6.\n\nThus, both parts of the claim are incorrect: the final episode doesn't have the second least viewers and it doesn't air on May 6.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Air Date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Viewers\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says that \"gary and allison brook be the episode with the least amount of viewer.\" Hmm, first off, I notice a typo there\u2014probably meant \"viewers\" instead of \"viewer.\" But let's not get bogged down by that. \n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents an episode with details like air date, timeslot, 18-49 ratings, and viewers. The relevant information here is the 'viewers' column because we're checking which episode has the least amount of viewers.\n\nI'll go through each row to find all the viewer numbers. Let's list them out:\n\nRow 1: 6.84\nRow 2: 6.97\nRow 3: 7.43\nRow 4: 7.71\nRow 5: 7.85\nRow 6: 6.44\nRow 7: 6.71\nRow 8: 8.14\nRow 9: 7.72\nRow 10: 8.03\nRow 11: 7.55\nRow 12: 7.07\nRow 13: 7.07\nRow 14: 6.86\nRow 15: 7.26\nRow 16: 7.71\nRow 17: 7.57\nRow 18: 7.3\nRow 19: 6.66\nRow 20: 5.55\n\nNow, looking for the smallest number here. The numbers start at 5.55 in row 20 and go up from there. So the lowest is 5.55. Let's see which episode that is\u2014episode \"gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal\" on May 20, 2009.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions \"gary and allison brook.\" Looking back at the table, row 8 is titled \"gary and allison brooks\"\u2014wait, actually, checking the exact title: it's \"gary and allison brook\" or \"brook\"? Let me check. The episode in row 8 is titled \"gary and allison brook,\" but looking again, no\u2014row 8 is actually titled \"gary and allison brooks.\" Wait, let me double-check:\n\nRow 8: \"gary uses his veto\"\u2014no, wait, that's row 16. Let me recount the rows correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the row indices earlier. Let me go through each row properly.\n\nWait no\u2014actually, the claim is about \"gary and allison brook,\" but looking at the table:\n\nRow 8: Episode title is \"gary uses his veto\"\u2014no, that's not correct. Wait, let me look again.\n\nLooking back, I think I might have miscounted the rows. Let's go through each row carefully:\n\n1. You're right\u2014the episode in question is \"gary and allison brook.\" Looking at the table, which row has this title?\n\nWait a second\u2014looking at the data provided:\n\nRow 8: Episode is titled \"gary uses his veto\" on March 11, 2009. No, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the rows. Let me recount from the top.\n\nThe table starts with row 1 as the first episode after the header. So:\n\nRow 1: \"You are tasked...\"\u2014no, wait, no\u2014the user provided a list of episodes numbered from row 1 to row 20.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have counted correctly.\n\nLooking back, the claim is about \"gary and allison brook.\" Let me find that episode in the table. Scanning through each episode title:\n\nRow 8: Episode is titled \"gary uses his veto\"\u2014no.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me look at each row's episode name:\n\nRow 1: gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal (May 20, 2009) \u2013 viewers 5.55\n\nSo the lowest is indeed 5.55 in row 20.\n\nBut the claim says \"gary and allison brook\" has the least viewers. From the table, I don't see an episode titled exactly like that. Let me check each title:\n\nLooking through rows 1 to 20:\n\n- Row 8: \"gary uses his veto\"\u2014no.\n- Row 7: \"gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal\"\u2014no.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a typo in the claim? Maybe the intended episode is \"gary and allison brooks\" or similar. But from the table provided, the episode with the lowest viewers is row 20: \"gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal\" with 5.55 viewers.\n\nSo if the claim refers to another episode, but in reality, the least viewers are for a different episode, then the claim is false.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error earlier. Let me confirm:\n\nLooking back at the table data provided by the user:\n\nThe last row (row 20) has \"gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal\" with 5.55 viewers.\n\nIn that case, if the claim states that a different episode (\"gary and allison brook\") has the least viewers, but actually, it's row 20 that does, then the claim is false.\n\nWait, but looking at the table again, perhaps I misread which episode \"gary and allison brook\" refers to. Let me scan each row:\n\nRow 1: gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal\n\nRow 2: ?\n\nNo, let's go step by step:\n\nLooking through all 20 rows:\n\n- Row 8 is titled \"gary uses his veto\"\u2014viewers 7.71\n- Row 16: \"gary uses his veto\" again? No.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the titles. Let me list out each episode title with their viewer counts:\n\nRow 1: gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal \u2013 5.55 (row 20)\nRow 2: ?\nWait no, let's list them properly.\n\nLooking at the user's table data:\n\nAfter row 17: \"gary hooks up allison\" with 7.57 viewers,\n\nRow 18: gary and the trophy \u2013 7.3\n\nRow 19: gary and his half brother \u2013 6.66\n\nRow 20: gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal \u2013 5.55\n\nSo, the episode with the least viewers is row 20.\n\nTherefore, if the claim says that \"gary and allison brook\" has the least viewers, but actually, it's another episode (row 20) that does, then the claim is false.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in identifying which row corresponds to \"gary and allison brook.\"\n\nLooking back through each row:\n\nRow 1: gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal\n\nRow 8: gary uses his veto \u2013 no.\n\nWait, perhaps it's not listed at all. Let me check again:\n\nThe episodes are as follows (from the user's data):\n\n- The last episode is row 20: \"gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal\"\n\nBut I don't see an episode titled \"gary and allison brook\" in any of the rows.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a typo or misstatement. Alternatively, maybe the intended episode is row 8 or another row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier; let me recount:\n\nLooking at each row's title:\n\n1. \"You are tasked...\" \u2013 no, that's the user prompt.\n\nThen, rows 1 to 20:\n\nRow 1: gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal\n\nWait, that can't be right because in reality, the first episode is different. Wait, perhaps I misread the initial data. Let me look again at how the user presented the table:\n\nThe user provided a list of 20 episodes with their respective titles and viewer counts, but I'm now confused about which row corresponds to which title.\n\nWait, perhaps the key point is that the claim says \"gary and allison brook\" has the least viewers, but according to the data, the episode with the least viewers is \"gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal\" in row 20. Therefore, if the claim attributes this to a different episode, it's false.\n\nThus, the correct answer would be that the statement is false because the episode with the fewest viewers is actually another one.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the episode \"gary and allison brook\" has the least number of viewers. However, according to the data provided:\n\n- The episode titled **\"gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal\"** (row 20) has the lowest viewer count at **5.55 million viewers**.\n- There is no episode listed under the title **\"gary and allison brook\"**.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it attributes the least viewers to an episode that doesn't exist in the data. The actual episode with the fewest viewers is \"gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal.\"\n\nAnswer: False",

The claim says that \"the title of every episode in season 1 mentions both Gary and Allison.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked here. The table provided has information about various episodes, including their titles. My task is to check each episode's title to see if all of them mention both Gary and Allison.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with details like the episode title, air date, timeslot, 18-49 ratings, viewers, etc. The relevant column here is \"episode,\" which contains the title of each episode.\n\nI'll go through each episode title one by one to see if both Gary and Allison are mentioned.\n\n1.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It claims that there are no episodes of \"Gary Unmarried\" that aired in December 2009. So I need to check if any episode in the given table has an air date in December 2009.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents an episode with details like the episode title, air date, timeslot, 18-49 rating, and viewers. The columns we're interested in are \"episode\" and \"air date\".\n\nI'll go through each row to check the air dates:\n\nRow 1: Air date is September 24, 2008.\nRow 2: October 1, 2008.\nRow 3: October 8, 2008.\nRow 4: October 15, 2008.\nRow 5: October 22, 2008.\nRow 6: November 5, 2008.\nRow 7: November 12, 2008.\nRow 8: November 19, 2008.\nRow 9: November 26, 2008.\nRow 10: December 10, 2008. \u2013 This is in December but in 2008, not 2009.\nRow 11: December 17, 2008.
