    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"center randy andreachuk be draft directly before center dennis sobchuk\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that Randy Andreachuk was drafted right before Dennis Sobchuk. That means in the draft order, Andreachuk should be in a round just one number lower than Sobchuk's round, meaning he was picked earlier (since lower rounds come first in drafts). \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different player with their respective details including the round they were drafted in. I'll need to find the rounds for both players mentioned.\n\nRandy Andreachuk is listed in Row 3. His position is center, and he was drafted in round 4. Dennis Sobchuk is in Row 4, also a center, and his draft round is 5.\n\nNow, checking the order: Round 4 comes before Round 5. That would mean Randy Andreachuk was indeed drafted before Dennis Sobchuk. Since the claim specifies that he was drafted \"directly\" before, I should confirm if there's any player between them in rounds 4 and 5. Looking at Row 3 (round 4) and Row 4 (round 5), there are no other rows or players in between these two, which means there are no draft picks separating them. Therefore, Andreachuk was picked right before Sobchuk without any intervening selections.\n\nSo, based on the table, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"2 players were drafted for the position of goaltender\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row and check the \"position\" column to see how many players have the position of goaltender.\n\nRow 1: Position is defense. Not a goaltender.\nRow 2: Position is right wing. Not a goaltender.\nRow 3: Center. No.\nRow 4: Center again. Nope.\nRow 5: Left wing. Still no.\nRow 6: Goaltender! That's the first one. So, row 6 is relevant.\nRow 7: Defense. Not a goaltender.\nRow 8: Position not given here; it's defense as per data but I think it's just to clarify.\nWait, looking back, each row does have a position specified. Let me double-check.\n\nWait no, in the table provided, each row has all columns filled. So Row 6 is the first goaltender. Then I continue:\n\nRow 7: Position is left wing.\nRow 8: Defense.\nRow 9: Center.\nRow 10: Right wing.\nRow 11: Goaltender! That's the second one, row 11.\nRow 12: Defense.\nRow 13: Left wing.\n\nSo I found two players with position goaltender: Row 6 (Reggie Lemelin) and Row 11 (Richard Guay). Therefore, the claim is TRUE because exactly two players were drafted as goalies.\n\nThe relevant cells are row indices 5 and 10 (since counting starts at 0), checking their positions. Wait no, in programming terms, rows start at index 0, but in the given data, Row 6 is index 5? Let me recount:\n\nRow 1: index 0\nRow 2: index 1\n...\nRow 6: index 5 (Reggie Lemelin)\nRow 7: index 6\nRow 8: index 7\nRow 9: index 8\nRow 10: index 9\nRow 11: index 10 (Richard Guay)\n\nWait, no. Looking back at the table provided, it's listed as rows from 1 to 13. So in terms of programming, if we consider row 1 as index 0 or row 1 as index 1? The user's example shows \"row_1: round:2\" and so on, with row indices starting at 0.\n\nWait the initial data is presented as:\n\nRow 1: ...\nRow 2: ...\n...\nSo in the table, rows are numbered from 1 to 13. But when we process it programmatically, if stored as an array, index would start at 0 for Row 1. So Reggie Lemelin is in Row 6 (original row numbering), which is index 5. Similarly, Richard Guay is in Row 12, which is index 11.\n\nWait no, let me count:\n\nRow 1: don mclean - index 0\nRow 2: bob sirois - index 1\nRow 3: randy andreachuk - index 2\nRow 4: dennis sobchuk - index 3\nRow 5: willie friesen - index 4\nRow 6: reggie lemelin - index 5 (goaltender)\nRow 7: steve short - index 6\nRow 8: peter mckenzie - index 7\nRow 9: marcel labrosse - index 8\nRow 10: scott jessee - index 9\nRow 11: richard guay - index 10 (goaltender)\nRow 12: brad morrow - index 11\nRow 13: craig arvidson - index 12\n\nSo, Reggie Lemelin is at row index 5 and Richard Guay at row index 10.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are these two rows' \"position\" columns. So in the JSON response, we list their row indices (as per programming starting from 0) as 5 and 10, with column_name \"position\".\n\nSo the claim is TRUE because there are exactly two players drafted for goaltender.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows two players with the position of goaltender: Reggie Lemelin in round 6 and Richard Guay in round 12.

The claim is that \"right wing Scott Jessee was drafted before left wing Craig Arvidson.\" I need to figure out if this is true or false based on the data provided.\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It mentions two players: Scott Jessee and Craig Arvidson. Their positions are right wing and left wing respectively, but more importantly, it's about their draft order. So I'm looking for when each of them was drafted relative to each other.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a 'round' number, which indicates the draft round. The earlier the round number, the earlier they were drafted. So the key is to find the rounds in which Scott Jessee and Craig Arvidson were picked.\n\nI'll scan through the rows:\n\n- Row 10: Round 11, Player Scott Jessee\n- Row 13: Round 14, Player Craig Arvidson\n\nWait, so Scott was drafted in round 11, and Craig in round 14. That means Scott was picked before Craig because 11 comes before 14. So the claim that Scott was drafted before Craig holds true.\n\nI should also make sure that I'm looking at the right players. The table mentions their positions as well: Scott is a right wing, and Craig is a left wing. The claim correctly states their positions too, which adds up.\n\nSo, all relevant cells are Scott Jessee's row (round 11) and Craig Arvidson's row (round 14).

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"3 center be draft and all be from canada\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It says that three centers were drafted, and all of them are from Canada. So I need to check two things: how many centers there are in the draft and whether each of those centers has Canadian nationality.\n\nLooking at the table, it has rows from 1 to 13, each representing a player with details about their round, position, nationality, etc.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to identify the players who are centers.\n\nRow 1: Don McLean is a defense player. So not a center.\n\nRow 2: Bob Sirois is a right wing. Not a center.\n\nRow 3: Randy Andreachuk is a center, and his nationality is Canada. That's one center from Canada.\n\nRow 4: Dennis Sobchuk is also a center, and he's Canadian. Now that's two centers.\n\nRow 5: Willie Friesen is a left wing. Not relevant.\n\nRow 6: Reggie Lemelin is a goaltender. Not a position we're considering for center.\n\nRow 7: Steve Short is a left wing from the United States. Not a center.\n\nRow 8: Peter McKenzie is a defense player, so not applicable.\n\nRow 9: Marcel Labrosse is another center, and he's Canadian as well. That makes three centers from Canada.\n\nRows 10 to 13: Scott Jessee is a right wing, Richard Guay is a goaltender, Brad Morrow is defense, and Craig Arvidson is left wing. None of these are centers.\n\nSo in total, there are three centers drafted: Randy Andreachuk (Row 3), Dennis Sobchuk (Row 4), and Marcel Labrosse (Row 9). All three have nationality listed as Canada. Therefore, the claim that \"3 center be draft and all be from canada\" is TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to list each cell in these rows where their position is center and nationality is Canada.

I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"center randy andreachuk be drafter first\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that \"center Randy Andreachuk was drafted first.\" So, I should check two things: \n\n1. Is Randy Andreachuk a center?\n2. Was he the first player drafted?\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different round and details about each player. The relevant columns for this claim are \"player,\" \"position,\" and \"round.\"\n\nStarting with the position, I'll scan through the players to find Randy Andreachuk. Scanning rows 1 to 13:\n\n- Row 3: Player is Randy Andreachuk, Position is center. So yes, he's a center.\n\nNow, checking if he was drafted first. The draft order is determined by the \"round\" column. Lower round numbers indicate earlier drafting. \n\nLooking at each player's round:\n\n- Round 2: Don McLean\n- Round 3: Bob Sirois\n- Round 4: Randy Andreachuk (this is the third round)\n- Rounds continue up to 14.\n\nWait, but if we're considering the first overall draft pick, it would be in Round 1. However, the table starts from Round 2. This suggests that either Round 1 isn't included here or maybe the information is incomplete. \n\nAssuming the table includes all relevant rounds, the earliest round mentioned is Round 2.

But if there's a Round 1 before this, then the actual first overall pick would be someone else not listed here.\n\nBut based solely on the given data, since the lowest round number in the table is Round 2, Randy Andreachuk was drafted in Round 4, which isn't the first. Therefore, he wasn't the first to be drafted according to this table.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I made an error. Let me re-examine: the claim says \"be drafter first,\" but looking at the draft rounds, the first player listed is Don McLean in Round 2. If we consider that Round 1 might have players not listed here, then Randy Andreachuk isn't the first overall pick. However, if the table starts from Round 2, then Don McLean would be the first in this context.\n\nBut the claim specifically mentions \"center Randy Andreachuk,\" so regardless of others, the question is whether he was drafted first among all the entries here. Since he's in Round 4, and there are players in earlier rounds (Round 2,3), he wasn't the first drafted.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the claim \"right wing scott jessee be draft last in the draft\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions a player named Scott Jessee who plays as a right wing and states that he was drafted last in the draft.\n\nLooking at the table, I should find the row where the player is Scott Jessee. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Don McLean\n- Row 2: Bob Sirois\n- ...\n- Row 10: Marcel Labrosse\n- Row 11: Scott Jessee\n\nSo, Scott Jessee is in Row 11. Let's check his details. His position is right wing, which matches the claim. Now, I need to determine if he was drafted last.\n\nEach row has a 'round' number. The draft order typically goes from round 1 being first to higher rounds later. Looking at the rounds:\n\n- Round 2: Row 1\n- Round 3: Row 2\n- ...\n- Round 14: Row 13\n\nSo, the last draft pick would be in the highest round number. The table has a maximum round of 14 in Row 13. Therefore, the player drafted last is in Row 13, which is Craig Arvidson.\n\nWait, but Scott Jessee is in Round 12 (Row 12). That means he was drafted earlier than the players in Rounds 13 and 14. So, he wasn't the last one drafted; Craig Arvidson was drafted last because he's in Round 14.\n\nThus, the claim that Scott Jessee was drafted last is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that right wing Scott Jessee was drafted last. From the table, Scott Jessee is listed in round 12 (row 11), while the last draft pick is in round 14 (row 13). Therefore, Scott Jessee was not the last to be drafted.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"all of the center draft be from the united state\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the term \"center draft\" refers to players who have the position listed as \"center.\" So, I should look through the table and identify all rows where the position is center. Next, for those identified rows, I need to check their nationalities to see if they are from the United States.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 3: Randy Andreachuk, position: center, nationality: Canada\n- Row 4: Dennis Sobchuk, position: center, nationality: Canada\n- Row 9: Marcel Labrosse, position: center, nationality: Canada\n\nThese are all the players listed as centers in the table. Each of them has a nationality listed as Canada, not the United States.\n\nThe claim states that \"all\" centers are from the U.S., but in reality, none of the centers in this table are from the U.S. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there are no center players from the United States in the given data.\n\nTo ensure I haven't missed any other centers, I'll double-check each row:\n\n- Rows 1 to 4: Only two centers (Randy and Dennis) both Canadian.\n- Row 5: Left wing\n- Rows 6 to 8: Goaltender, defense, left wing\n- Rows 9 to 13: Center (Marcel), defense, etc., all from Canada or the U.S. but not as centers.\n\nThus, my conclusion is that the claim is FALSE because none of the center positions are from the United States.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_2\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
