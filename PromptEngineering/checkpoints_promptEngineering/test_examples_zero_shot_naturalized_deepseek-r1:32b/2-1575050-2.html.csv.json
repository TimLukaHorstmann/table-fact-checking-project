It mentions the total being 2 for bronze. So, I should look at the 'bronze' column in the table and see if the total adds up to 2.\n\nLooking at the table row by row:\n\n- Row 1: United States has 0 bronze medals.\n- Row 2: Poland also has 0 bronze.\n- Row 3: Sweden has 0 bronze as well.\n- Row 4: Finland has 1 bronze.\n- Row 5: Soviet Union has 1 bronze.\n\nNow, adding up all the bronze medals from these rows: 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 2. That matches the claim of total being 2 for bronze. \n\nAdditionally, the last row (Row 6) shows the totals, where bronze is listed as 2. This confirms that the overall total for bronze medals is indeed 2.\n\nSo, both the sum of individual countries' bronze medals and the total row in the table support the claim. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the soviet union (urs) score 2 bronze\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has rows with columns: rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, and total. The table lists several nations along with their medal counts.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions the Soviet Union (urs) scoring 2 bronze medals. So, my task is to check if that's accurate according to the table.\n\nI'll scan through each row of the table:\n\n- Row 1: United States has 0 bronze.\n- Row 2 and 3: Poland and Sweden both have 0 bronze as well.\n- Row 4: Finland has 1 bronze.\n- Row 5: Soviet Union (urs) has 1 bronze.\n- The last row is the total, which shows 2 bronze in total across all nations.\n\nSo, looking at the Soviet Union's row (Row 5), it only has 1 bronze medal. The claim says they scored 2 bronze, but according to the table, it's just 1. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n\nThe relevant cells here are the bronze column for the Soviet Union in Row 5. That's where we can see they have only 1 bronze medal.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
