    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"paul pierce lead the team in points for 5 of the 7 games\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim states that Paul Pierce led his team in scoring in five out of seven games listed. To verify this, I'll need to look at each game and check who had the highest points for their team in each row.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\nEach row represents a game (from Game 76 to Game 82). For each game, there's information about the date, opponent team, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, and record. The key column here is \"high points,\" which tells us who scored the most in that game.\n\nSo my task is to go through each of the seven games (rows 1 to 7) and count how many times Paul Pierce's name appears under the \"high points\" section.\n\nLet me list out each row and check:\n\nRow 1: Game 76, April 1 vs Charlotte. High points: Paul Pierce (32). So he led here. Count = 1.\n\nRow 2: Game 77, April 3 vs Atlanta. High points: Paul Pierce (21). He led again. Count = 2.\n\nRow 3: Game 78, April 8 vs New Jersey. High points: Rajon Rondo (31). Not Paul Pierce. So count remains 2.\n\nRow 4: Game 79, April 10 vs Miami. High points: Paul Pierce (28). He led here. Count = 3.\n\nRow 5: Game 80, April 12 vs Cleveland. High points: Paul Pierce (14). But wait, looking at the score, it's a loss (76-107), but in terms of team points, who had the highest? Wait, no\u2014the \"high points\" for each game are just individual player stats regardless of the team's win or loss. So even if the team lost, the high scorer is still noted. However, in this case, Paul Pierce has 14, but the opponent might have someone with higher, but since we're only looking at our team's high points, it's whoever on the team scored the most. Let me check: \"high points: paul pierce (14)\". So he led here as well? Or did someone else?\n\nWait, in row 5, the high points are listed as Paul Pierce with 14. So that would mean he was the top scorer for his team in that game. Therefore, count = 4.\n\nRow 6: Game 81, April 14 vs Philadelphia. High points: Paul Pierce (31). He led again. Count =5.\n\nRow 7: Game 82, April 15 vs Washington. High points: Glen Davis (21). So Paul Pierce didn't lead here. Count remains at 5.\n\nSo adding up the games where Paul Pierce was the top scorer:\n\nGame 76: Yes\n\nGame 77: Yes\n\nGame 78: No\n\nGame 79: Yes\n\nGame 80: Yes (if his 14 is the highest on his team)\n\nWait, in row 5, Game 80, Paul Pierce has 14 points. Is there anyone else listed for high points? The \"high points\" column only lists Paul Pierce (14). So that means he was the leading scorer for his team in that game.\n\nSo, Games 76, 77, 79, 80, and 81: that's five games where Paul led. Game 78 and 82 are the two where someone else did.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because he led in 5 out of 7 games.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"rajon rondo have the most assist for the celtic (12) in 1 game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break down the claim and check each part against the data.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions Rajon Rondo having the most assists with 12 in one game. So I should look for a row where Rondo's assists are listed as 12. \n\nLooking at Row 4: Game 79 on April 10 against Miami. The high assists column shows Rajon Rondo (12). That matches exactly what the claim is stating. \n\nI should also check if there are any other instances where Rondo has more than 12 assists, but scanning through all rows, it seems that 12 is the highest he had in a single game here.\n\nAdditionally, I need to confirm that this was indeed a Celtics game since the table's team column shows various opponents but the location is always either TD Banknorth Garden or others. However, since the team name isn't specified for each row beyond the opponent, but all games are presumably played by the Celtics as they're listed in rows with their performance stats.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by Row 4 where Rondo had 12 assists.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_ign\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"the celtics win all of the game they play at td bank north garden\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that every game the Celtics played at TD Banknorth Garden resulted in a win. So my task is to check each row of the table where the location was TD Banknorth Garden and see if all those games were wins.\n\nLooking at the table, there are seven rows, each representing a different game. I need to go through each one and note both the location (to see if it's TD Banknorth Garden) and the score outcome (win or loss).\n\nStarting with Row 1: The team is Charlotte, date April 1. The location is TD Banknorth Garden, and the score shows a win with 111-109 in double overtime. So that's a win.\n\nRow 2: Team Atlanta on April 3. Location is again TD Banknorth Garden, and they won 104-92 in overtime. Another win.\n\nRow 3: New Jersey on April 8. Still at TD Banknorth Garden, another win with 106-104 in OT.\n\nRow 4: Miami on April 10, location same, score shows a win 105-98 OT. So that's four wins in a row there so far.\n\nRow 5: Cleveland on April 12. Wait, the location here is Quicken Loans Arena, which is different. They lost this game 76-107 OT. But since it's not at TD Banknorth Garden, it doesn't affect our claim. So we can ignore this row for our purpose.\n\nRow 6: Philadelphia on April 14. The location is Wachovia Center, so again, not TD Banknorth Garden. They won here, but that's irrelevant to the claim about games at their home venue.\n\nRow 7: Washington on April 15. Back at TD Banknorth Garden. Score shows a win 115-107 OT. So that's another win there.\n\nSo now I need to count how many games were played at TD Banknorth Garden and check if all of them resulted in wins.\n\nFrom the table:\nRows 1,2,3,4,7 were at TD Banknorth Garden. Let me confirm each:\n\n- Row 1: Win\n- Row 2: Win\n- Row 3: Win\n- Row 4: Win\n- Row 7: Win\n\nThat's five games all resulting in wins.\n\nIs there any game at TD Banknorth Garden where they lost? Looking back, no. All the games listed at that location ended with a win.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be TRUE because every game played at TD Banknorth Garden resulted in a victory for the Celtics.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all games played by the Celtics at TD Banknorth Garden resulted in wins. After examining each relevant row where the location was TD Banknorth Garden, all outcomes were wins. Thus, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the celtic win 6 of their 7 game during this stretch\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim says. It mentions that the Celtics won 6 out of 7 games in a particular period. To verify this, I need to examine the results of each game listed in the table and count how many they won and lost.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 8 rows (games 76 to 83), but let me check each one:\n\n1. Game 76: The result is \"w 111 - 109\" with a record of 57-19. Since it's marked as 'w', that's a win.\n2. Game 77: Scored \"w 104 - 92\". Another win, bringing the total to 2 wins.\n3. Game 78: \"w 106 - 104\" is also a win. Now at 3 wins.\n4. Game 79: \"w 105 - 98\" again a win. Total now 4 wins.\n5. Game 80: Here, it's marked as \"l 76 - 107\". This is a loss. So 4 wins and 1 loss so far.\n6. Game 81: The result is \"w 100 - 98\", another win. Now 5 wins, 1 loss.\n7. Game 82: \"w 115 - 107\" is a win, making it 6 wins and 1 loss.\n\nWait, that's only two games beyond game 79. Let me recount. From game 76 to game 82, there are seven games (games 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82). Checking each:\n\n- Game 76: Win\n- Game 77: Win\n- Game 78: Win\n- Game 79: Win\n- Game 80: Loss\n- Game 81: Win\n- Game 82: Win\n\nSo that's 6 wins and 1 loss. Therefore, the claim is correct.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells in the table for each game outcome. Each row has a \"score\" column indicating win or loss. So, for each of these seven games (rows 0 to 6), the relevant cell is the 'score' column.\n\nSo, compiling the relevant cells:\n\n- Row 1: score\n- Row 2: score\n- Row 3: score\n- Row 4: score\n- Row 5: score\n- Row 6: score\n- Row 7: score\n\nWait, but in the table provided earlier, it's only up to row 7 (game 82). So that's seven games as per the claim.\n\nTherefore, each of these rows' 'score' column is relevant because they show whether each game was a win or loss. Counting them as above gives 6 wins and 1 loss.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the highest point total for a celtic player in 1 game be 32 , by paul pierce.\" \n\nFirst, I should parse each part of the claim carefully. It's saying that Paul Pierce scored 32 points in one game, and that this is the highest single-game score by any Celtic player.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several rows (each representing a game) with columns including \"game,\" \"date,\" \"team,\" \"score,\" \"high points,\" etc. The key column here is \"high points\" which lists who scored the most in that particular game and their points.\n\nI'll go through each row to find instances where Paul Pierce is listed under \"high points\" and check his point totals.\n\nStarting with Row 1: Game 76, date April 1 vs Charlotte. High points are Paul Pierce with 32. That's the first mention of him scoring that high.\n\nRow 2: Game 77, April 3 vs Atlanta. Paul Pierce again leads with 21 points. Not as high as 32.\n\nRow 3: Game 78, April 8 vs New Jersey. Rajon Rondo is listed for high points with 31. So no, Paul doesn't reach 32 here.\n\nRow 4: Game 79, April 10 vs Miami. Paul Pierce scores 28, which is less than 32.\n\nRow 5: Game 80, April 12 vs Cleveland. He scores only 14 points in this game, so lower still.\n\nMoving to Row 6: Game 81, April 14 vs Philadelphia. Paul Pierce again leads with 31 points. Close but not higher than 32.\n\nRow 7: Game 82, April 15 vs Washington. The high scorer here is Glen Davis with 21, so no mention of Paul Pierce in this row.\n\nFrom the above analysis, the highest point total by a Celtics player in one game, according to the table, is indeed 32 points scored by Paul Pierce in Game 76 against Charlotte on April 1. \n\nI should also check if any other player has a higher score than 32 in these games, just to be thorough. Looking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: 32 (Paul)\n- Row 2: 21\n- Row 3: 31\n- Row 4: 28\n- Row 5: 14\n- Row 6: 31\n- Row 7: 21\n\nNo player in any of these games exceeds Paul Pierce's 32 points. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n\nThe relevant cells are those that show Paul Pierce's high points, specifically in Game 76 where he scored 32 points. So, I'll note row index 0 (since rows start at 0) and the \"high points\" column.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n   ]\n}",

I need to determine whether the claim \"kendrick perkins have the most assist for the celtic (12) in 1 game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. The claim states that Kendrick Perkins had the most assists for the Celtics with 12 in one game. So, I need to check each row of the table to see if there's any instance where Perkins led the team in assists with exactly 12.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Game 76 - High Assists: Rajon Rondo (9)\nRow 2: Game 77 - High Assists: Rondo (6)\nRow 3: Game 78 - High Assists: Rondo and Stephon Marbury both have 5. Wait, no, the cell says \"rajon rondo , stephon marbury (5)\", which probably means they each had 5. So Perkins isn't listed here.\nRow 4: Game 79 - High Assists: Rondo (12)\nWait, here in row 4, Rondo has 12 assists. But the claim is about Perkins having 12.\n\nRow 5: Game 80 - High Assists: Rondo (6)\nRow 6: Game 81 - High Assists: Tony Allen and Marbury with 5 each.\nRow 7: Game 82 - High Assists: Marbury (8)\n\nSo, looking through all the rows, I don't see any instance where Kendrick Perkins is listed as having the most assists. In row 4, Rondo has 12, which is higher than any other player's assists in that game.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Perkins never had 12 assists in a single game according to this table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Kendrick Perkins had 12 assists in one game.

The claim says: \"Paul Pierce led the team in points for 6 of the 7 games.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each game row (there are 7 rows from Game 76 to Game 82) and check who had the highest points in each. Paul Pierce is mentioned several times as having high points, but I need to count how many times he was the top scorer.\n\nStarting with Row 1 (Game 76): High points are Paul Pierce with 32. So that's one for Paul.\n\nRow 2 (Game 77): Again, Paul leads with 21 points.\n\nRow 3 (Game 78): Rajon Rondo is listed as high points with 31. Paul isn't mentioned here, so he doesn't lead in this game.\n\nRow 4 (Game 79): Paul has 28, which seems higher than others not specified, so that's a third time.\n\nRow 5 (Game 80): Paul has 14 points. But the team lost, and I don't know who else scored, but it says \"high points\" as Paul, so maybe he still led? Wait, but sometimes other players could have higher without being mentioned. Hmm, need to clarify that. The table only lists high points for each game, so if someone else had higher than Paul, it would be listed instead.\n\nRow 6 (Game 81): Paul has 31 points, leading again.\n\nRow 7 (Game 82): Glen Davis led with 21. So Paul didn't lead here.\n\nSo counting the times Paul led: Game 76, 77, 79, 81 \u2013 that's four games.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for games played at TD Banknorth Garden. The table has seven rows, each representing a different game with details like date, team, score, and location. The 'location attendance' column indicates where each game was played. \n\nLooking through each row:\n- Row 1: Location is TD Banknorth Garden.\n- Row 2: Same location.\n- Row 3: Still at TD Banknorth Garden.\n- Row 4: Also here.\n- Row 5: This one is at Quicken Loans Arena, so not relevant.\n- Row 6: Played at Wachovia Center.\n- Row 7: Back to TD Banknorth Garden.\n\nSo rows 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 are the games played at TD Banknorth Garden. Now I need to check if all these games resulted in losses for the Celtics.\n\nLooking at the 'score' column:\n- Row 1: Score is W 111 - 109 (OT). The 'W' indicates a win.\n- Row 2: Also shows W, so another win.\n- Row 3: Again, W, meaning they won.\n- Row 4: W, yet another win.\n- Row 7: Score is W 115 - 107 (OT), so they won this game too.\n\nWait a minute, all these games at TD Banknorth Garden resulted in wins for the Celtics. The claim says they lost all those games, which isn't true. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are the 'score' entries for each game played at TD Banknorth Garden to confirm whether it was a win or loss.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. \n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"the highest point total for a celtic player in 1 game be 32, by stephon marbury.\" So, according to this statement, Stephon Marbury scored 32 points in one game for the Celtics.\n\nNext, I need to check each row of the table to see if there's any instance where Stephon Marbury had a high point total of 32. Looking through the rows:\n\n- **Row 1**: High points are Paul Pierce with 32. Not Stephon Marbury.\n- **Row 2**: Paul Pierce again, this time 21 points.\n- **Row 3**: Rajon Rondo leads with 31 points. Still no Stephon Marbury at 32.\n- **Row 4**: Paul Pierce scores 28. Close but not 32 and still not Stephon.\n- **Row 5**: Paul Pierce again, this time only 14 points. No relevant data here.\n- **Row 6**: Paul Pierce with 31. Almost there, but not 32.\n- **Row 7**: Glen Davis has the high points with 21. No Stephon Marbury mentioned.\n\nLooking across all rows, Stephon Marbury isn't listed under \"high points\" anywhere in the table. The highest point total by a Celtic player is indeed 32, but it's Paul Pierce who achieved that in Row 1 and Row 6 he had 31. \n\nSince there's no instance where Stephon Marbury scored 32 points in any of these games, the claim isn't supported by the data provided. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nI'll make sure to list all relevant cells from each row that mentions \"high points\" because they directly relate to verifying the claim about the highest scorer and their point totals.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the celtic lose 6 of their 7 game during this stretch",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim in question is: \"the celtic lose 6 of their 7 game during this stretch.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that the Celtics lost six out of seven games in a particular period. To verify this, I'll have to look at the table provided and check each relevant row for information about wins (W) or losses (L).\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a game with details like date, team played against, score outcome, etc. The key column here is \"score,\" which indicates whether it's a win or a loss. For example, \"w 104 - 92\" means a win, while \"l 76 - 107\" would be a loss.\n\nNow, the claim refers to seven games. From the table provided, there are eight rows (games 76 to 83), but the user's instruction mentions a stretch of seven games. Let me check how many games are in this specific range or if it's a typo and should refer to a different set.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the claim again: \"the celtic lose 6 of their 7 game during this stretch.\" It says seven games, so I need to identify seven consecutive games from the table. Let me see which rows these could be.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: Game 76 (win)\n- Row 2: Game 77 (win)\n- Row 3: Game 78 (win)\n- Row 4: Game 79 (win)\n- Row 5: Game 80 (loss)\n- Row 6: Game 81 (win)\n- Row 7: Game 82 (win)\n\nWait, so from game 76 to 82, that's seven games. Let me count the wins and losses in these rows.\n\nGame 76: Win\nGame 77: Win\nGame 78: Win\nGame 79: Win\nGame 80: Loss\nGame 81: Win\nGame 82: Win\n\nThat's one loss out of seven games, not six. Hmm, so the claim is that they lost six of seven, but according to this data, it's just one loss.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the rows. Let me double-check each row:\n\nRow 1: W\nRow 2: W\nRow 3: W\nRow 4: W\nRow 5: L\nRow 6: W\nRow 7: W\n\nYes, only game 80 is a loss in these seven games.\n\nWait, but the user's table has eight rows (games 76 to 83), so perhaps the claim refers to another set of seven games. Let me check all possible consecutive sequences of seven games within this data.\n\nThe total number of games here is 7 (from game 76 to game 82, as row 7 is game 82). There's no game 83 in the table provided; it stops at game 82. So perhaps the user made a typo, but based on the data given, there are seven games from 76 to 82.\n\nIn these seven games, only one loss (game 80) is present. Therefore, the claim that they lost six of seven would be false because only one game was lost in that stretch.\n\nI think I should also check if any other rows could form a different set of seven games where more losses occurred, but looking at all rows, most are wins except for row 5 (game 80). So the claim doesn't hold based on this data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE. Among the seven games listed in the table, the Celtics only lost one game (Game 80), not six.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_1_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
