Who achieved that score and what is their language?\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 3 has points 27. The artist here is Andr\u00e9 Claveau from France.\n- Let's go through each row to confirm.\n\nRow 1: Points 13, not the highest.\nRow 2: Points 1, lower than Row 3.\nRow 3: Points 27, French artist.\nRow 4: Points 1, same as Row 2.\nRow 5: Points 10, less than 27.\nRow 6: Points 3.\nRow 7: Points 8.\nRow 8: Points 5.\nRow 9: Points 8 again.\nRow 10: Points 24, which is close but still less than 27.\n\nSo the highest points are indeed 27 in Row 3.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"3 of the 10 entries for the eurovision 1958 song contest be in french\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim states that out of 10 entries, exactly three are in French. So, my goal is to count how many songs have \"french\" listed as their language.\n\nLooking at the table, there are ten rows, each representing an entry. Each row has a 'language' column which indicates the language of the song. I'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Row 1: Language is Italian.\n2. Row 2: Language is Dutch.\n3. Row 3: Language is French. (Count = 1)\n4. Row 4: Language is French. (Count = 2)\n5. Row 5: Language is Swedish.\n6. Row 6: Language is Danish.\n7. Row 7: Language is French. (Count = 3)\n8. Row 8: Language is German.\n9. Row 9: Language is German.\n10. Row 10: Languages are German and Italian.\n\nSo, from this count, I found three entries where the language is French. These are rows 3, 4, and 7.\n\nTherefore, the claim that exactly three out of ten entries are in French is supported by the data provided. The relevant cells are the 'language' column for these three rows.\n\nNow, compiling the relevant cells as per the instructions: each entry should have a \"row_index\" (starting from 0) and \"column_name\". So, row 3 would be index 2, row 4 is index 3, and row 7 is index 6. The column in question is 'language'.\n\nHence, the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cells are those three entries.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"language\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It mentions that the last two competitors (probably the ones with the lowest points) scored only 1 point each. So I should look at the 'points' column to find out who got 1 point.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 2: Points = 1\nRow 4: Points = 1\n\nSo both Row 2 and Row 4 have a score of 1 point each. Now, are these the last two competitors? Let's check their 'place' column to see where they finished.\n\nRow 2: Place = 9\nRow 4: Place = 9\n\nWait, that's interesting. Both have the same place, which is 9th. So in a competition, usually, higher points mean better placement. But in this case, both got the lowest points and tied for last place.\n\nSo according to the table, yes, the two competitors with 1 point are indeed the final ones (since their places are the lowest at 9). Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the final two competitors each scored 1 point.

I need to determine if the claim \"the highest point score be by a dutch artist name andr\u00e9 claveau\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table to understand its structure. Each row has several columns: draw number, language, artist name, song title, English translation, place, and points.

However, Andr\u00e9 Claveau is in row 3, but his language is French, not Dutch.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the highest point score (27) is by a Dutch artist named Andr\u00e9 Claveau is incorrect because while Andr\u00e9 Claveau has the highest points, he's a French artist, not Dutch.

It states that none of the ten entries from the contest are Danish. So, I need to check if any song in the table has a language listed as Danish.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- Row 1: Italian\n- Row 2: Dutch\n- Row 3: French\n- Row 4: French\n- Row 5: Swedish\n- Row 6: Danish\n- Row 7: French\n- Row 8: German\n- Row 9: German\n- Row 10: German, Italian\n\nWait, in Row 6, the language is Danish. So that's a contradiction to the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there is at least one Danish song in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"language\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
