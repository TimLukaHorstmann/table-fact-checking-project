However, since both schools are part of IHSAA (as per their IDs), it's possible they're in the same conference, but that detail isn't provided here. The claim compares enrollments, which is directly given.\n\nSo, Bremen has 505 students, and Culver Community has 306.

It says \"be\" instead of \"is\". So perhaps it's meant to say that Bremen is in a different IHSAA class than Culver Community.\n\nNow, let me check the table for both schools: Bremen and Culver Community.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Bremen has an IHSAA class of AA. Row 2: Culver Community has an IHSAA class of A.\n\nSo, AA vs. A. Are these different classes? Yes, they are. So according to the table, Bremen is in a higher class than Culver Community, so their IHSAA classes are indeed different.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE because their IHSAA classes are not the same.\n\nThe relevant cells are the \"ihsaa class\" for both Bremen and Culver Community.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"In the northern state conference (IHSAA), Bremen joined 12 years after Culver Community.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what this means. It says that Bremen joined 12 years after Culver Community in the same conference, which is the Northern State Conference under IHSAA.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school with details like their IHSAA ID, location, mascot, enrollment, class, county, and year joined. \n\nI need to check two things:\n1. Are both Bremen and Culver Community part of the same conference? The claim mentions the Northern State Conference (IHSAA), but looking at the table, each school only has information about their IHSAA class and county, not the specific conference they're in. So the table doesn't provide info on conferences; it just lists IHSAA classes and counties.\n\nWait, maybe the conference isn't explicitly listed here. The claim mentions \"northern state conference (IHSAA)\", but the table only has each school's IHSAA class. So without knowing if both are in the same conference, how can we be sure? Hmm, this might complicate things because the claim is making a statement about their conference membership, which isn't directly provided in the table.\n\nBut let's assume for a moment that all these schools are part of the Northern State Conference since the claim specifies it. Maybe the table includes only schools from that conference, but the user hasn't specified that. Alternatively, perhaps the \"county\" can help infer if they're in the same area and thus possibly the same conference.\n\nLooking at Bremen: It's in county 50 Marshall, year joined 1989.\nCulver Community is also in county 50 Marshall, year joined 1977. So both are in the same county. That might suggest they're in the same conference if conferences are organized by counties or regions.\n\nNow, checking the years: Culver joined in 1977, Bremen joined in 1989. The difference is 12 years (1989 - 1977 = 12). So according to this, Bremen did join 12 years after Culver Community.\n\nBut wait, the table doesn't mention anything about conferences, just the year they joined IHSAA. So the claim is specifically about the Northern State Conference (IHSAA), but we don't know if both schools are in that conference based on the data provided. They could be in different conferences within IHSAA.\n\nHowever, perhaps the user assumes that all these schools are part of the same conference since they're listed together in the table. Or maybe the counties can indicate conference membership\u2014if both are in county 50 Marshall, they might be in the same conference.\n\nGiven that, Bremen joined in 1989 and Culver in 1977, which is exactly 12 years apart. So if we assume they're in the same conference, the claim would be true.\n\nBut since the table doesn't explicitly state their conference membership, there's some uncertainty here. However, based on the counties being the same (50 Marshall), it's plausible they are in the same conference. Therefore, I think the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"}\n   ]\n}",

The claim states: \"In the northern state conference (IHSAA), Laville has a lower enrollment than Jimtown.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what the claim is saying. It compares the enrollments of two schools: Laville and Jimtown. Specifically, it claims that Laville's enrollment is lower than Jimtown's.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\n- Row 6 corresponds to Laville. The enrollment number here is 413.\n- Row 4 corresponds to Jimtown. Their enrollment is listed as 642.\n\nSo, comparing these two numbers: 413 (Laville) vs. 642 (Jimtown). Clearly, 413 is less than 642. Therefore, Laville does have a lower enrollment than Jimtown.\n\nI should also check if both schools are part of the same conference as mentioned in the claim\u2014the northern state conference under IHSAA. However, the table doesn't explicitly mention conferences for each school. It only provides information about their IDs, locations, mascots, enrollments, classes, counties, and years joined. \n\nBut since the claim is specifically within the context of the northern state conference (IHSAA), and both schools are listed under IHSAA with respective classifications (A for Laville and AAA for Jimtown), it's reasonable to assume they might be in the same conference or at least part of the same association.\n\nTherefore, based on the enrollment numbers provided, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

For each school, check their \"enrollment\" column.\n\nFor Laville (Row 6), the enrollment is listed as 413.\nFor Triton (Row 8), the enrollment is 333.\n\nNow, comparing these two: 413 (Laville) vs. 333 (Triton). Since 413 is greater than 333, Laville indeed has a higher enrollment than Triton.\n\nI should make sure that both schools are part of the Northern State Conference under IHSAA, but the claim doesn't provide details on conferences beyond mentioning it.

The claim is about two schools: Bremen and Culver Community. It's stating that Bremen joined the Northern State Conference (IHSAA) five years before Culver Community did.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a school with details like their IHSAA ID, location, mascot, enrollment, IHSAA class, county, and year joined. So, to check the claim, I need to find the \"year joined\" for both Bremen and Culver Community.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Row 1 is Bremen. Its \"year joined\" is listed as 1989.\n- Row 2 is Culver Community. Their \"year joined\" is 1977.\n\nWait a minute, that's interesting because 1989 is later than 1977. So according to this, Bremen actually joined after Culver Community, not five years before. The claim says Bremen joined five years earlier, but in reality, Culver Community joined in 1977 and Bremen in 1989. That's a difference of 12 years, with Bremen joining later.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because Bremen did not join five years before Culver Community; instead, they joined 12 years after.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Bremen joined IHSAA five years before Culver Community.

It's about two schools: Walkerton and Culver Community. The claim states that they are in the same IHSAA class within the Northern State Conference.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Walkerton is mentioned in Row 3. Let me check the details:\n   - School (IHSAA ID): Glenn\n   - Location: Walkerton\n   - Mascot: Falcons\n   - Enrollment: 613\n   - IHSAA Class: AAA\n   - County: 71 St Joseph\n   - Year Joined: 1966\n\n- Culver Community is in Row 2:\n   - School (IHSAA ID): Culver Community\n   - Location: Culver\n   - Mascot: Cavaliers\n   - Enrollment: 306\n   - IHSAA Class: A\n   - County: 50 Marshall\n   - Year Joined: 1977\n\nNow, checking the IHSAA classes:\n- Walkerton (Glenn) is in AAA.\n- Culver Community is in A.\n\nSince their IHSAA classes are different (AAA vs. A), the claim that they are in the same class is FALSE.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider if there's any mention of Northern State Conference in the table.

The claim says, \"In the northern state conference (IHSAA), Laville has a lower enrollment than Culver Community.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table to find relevant information. The table lists several schools with details like their IHSAA ID, location, mascot, enrollment numbers, class, county, and year joined.\n\nThe key parts here are the enrollments for Laville and Culver Community. Let me scan through each row:\n\nRow 1 is Bremen.\nRow 2: Culver Community has an enrollment of 306.\nRow 3: Glenn's enrollment is 613.\nRow 4: Jimtown with 642.\nRow 5: Knox Community at 632.\nRow 6: Laville has 413 students enrolled.\nRow 7: New Prairie with 859.\nRow 8: Triton at 333.\n\nWait, the claim is about Laville and Culver.

Let me double-check: Row 2 for Culver says 306, and row 6 for Laville says 413. Yes, so Culver has fewer students than Laville. Therefore, the claim that Laville has a lower enrollment is false because 413 is higher than 306.\n\nI should also check if both schools are in the northern state conference (IHSAA). Looking at their counties: Culver is in 50 Marshall, and Laville is in 71 St. Joseph. I don't have information on which conferences these counties belong to, but assuming that being part of IHSAA class is enough for the conference context since both are listed under IHSAA classes A and A.\n\nSo, based on the enrollments alone, the claim is false because Laville's enrollment (413) is higher than Culver Community's (306).
