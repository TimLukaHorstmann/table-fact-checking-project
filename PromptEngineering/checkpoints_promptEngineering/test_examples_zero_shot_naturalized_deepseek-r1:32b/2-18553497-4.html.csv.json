    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"gamal hamza and junior agogo be the only player to score in more than 1 event.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse the table to understand each player's scores across different events.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- Gamal Hamza is in row 7. His Egyptian Premier League score is 1, Egypt Cup is 0, Caf Champions League is 2, and total is 3.\n- Junior Agogo is in row 3. He has 3 in the Egyptian Premier League, 0 in Egypt Cup, 1 in Caf Champions League, totaling 4.\n\nThe claim says these two are the only players who scored in more than one event. So, I need to check if any other player has scores in multiple events.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Sherif Ashraf (row1): Scores only in Egyptian Premier League.\n- Mahmoud Fathallah (row2): Only Premier League.\n- Junior Agogo (row3): Premier and Caf Champions League.\n- Abdel Halim Ali, Hani Said, Shikabala, Ahmed Magdy, Mostafa Gaafar, Alaa Kamal, Mahmoud Samir, Ricardo Alves Fernandes, Sabry Raheel, Wisam El AbdY: All have scores in only one event each (Premier League mostly).\n- Amr El Safty (row15): Only Caf Champions League.\n- Own Goals (row16): Premier League.\n- Totals (row17): Not a player.\n\nSo, Gamal Hamza and Junior Agogo are the only ones with scores in more than one event. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Gamal Hamza and Junior Agogo are the only players who scored in more than one event. By examining each row of the table, we confirm that all other players have non-zero scores in only one event. Thus, the claim holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_ index\": 3, \"column_ name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n     {\"row_ index\": 3, \"column_ name\": \"caf champions league\"},\n     {\"row_ index\": 7, \"column_ name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n     {\"row_ index\": 7, \"column_ name\": \"caf champions league\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"hani said scored 3 goal total and sabry raheel score 1 goal total\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the structure of the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with their respective goals in different competitions: Egyptian Premier League, Egypt Cup, Caf Champions League, and the Total goals. My task is to check the totals for two specific players mentioned in the claim: hani said and sabry raheel.\n\nFirst, I'll look for hani said in the table. Scanning through the rows, row 5 has name: hani said. The total column under this row shows a value of 3. So according to the table, hani said has scored a total of 3 goals. That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, I'll check sabry raheel. Looking through the rows, row 15 is named sabry raheel. The total column for this row also shows a value of 1. This aligns with the second part of the claim which states that sabry raheel scored 1 goal in total.\n\nI should also ensure there are no other entries for these players or any discrepancies. Scanning through all rows, I don't see any duplicates for hani said or sabry raheel, so it's clear each has only one entry with their respective totals.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are correctly supported by the data in the table. Hani said indeed scored 3 goals total, and Sabry Raheel scored 1 goal total.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as both hani said and sabry raheel's goal totals match the information in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"amr el - safty be the only player on the list to not score in the egyptian premier league.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down what this means. It's claiming that Amr El-Safty is the sole player who didn't score any goals in the Egyptian Premier League. So, I need to check two things:\n\n1. Does Amr El-Safty have zero goals in the Egyptian Premier League?\n2. Are all other players on the list having at least one goal in that league?\n\nLooking at the table, let's find Amr El-Safty. Scanning through the rows, row 15 has his name. The column for egyptian premier league shows 0 goals. So condition one is met.\n\nNow, I need to check if every other player has scored at least once in the Egyptian Premier League. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Sherif Ashraf has 6.\n- Row 2: Mahmoud Fathallah has 5.\n- Row 3: Junior Agogo has 3.\n- Row 4: Abdel Halim Ali has 3.\n- Row 5: Hani Said has 3.\n- Row 6: Shikabala has 3.\n- Row 7: Gamal Hamza has 1.\n- Row 8: Ahmed Magdy has 2.\n- Row 9: Mostafa Gaafar has 2.\n- Row 10: Alaa Kamal has 1.\n- Row 11: Mahmoud Samir has 1.\n- Row 12: Ricardo Alves Fernandes has 1.\n- Row 13: Sabry Raheel has 1.\n- Row 14: Wisam El Abdy has 1.\n- Row 15: Amr El-Safty has 0 (already checked).\n- Row 16: Own Goals have 1.\n  \nWait, but row 17 is totals. It says egyptian premier league total is 34. That includes all players except own goals? Or does it include everyone? Let me see: summing up the Egyptian Premier League scores from rows 1-15 (excluding totals):\n\n6 +5+3+3+3+3+1+2+2+1+1+1+1+1+0 = let's calculate:\n\n6+5=11, +3=14, +3=17, +3=20, +3=23, +1=24, +2=26, +2=28, +1=29, +1=30, +1=31, +1=32. So 32 from rows 1-15. Plus own goals (row16) which is 1, total should be 33, but the totals row says 34. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Maybe I missed one.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRow1:6\n\nRow2:5 => 11\n\nRow3:3 =>14\n\nRow4:3 =>17\n\nRow5:3 =>20\n\nRow6:3 =>23\n\nRow7:1 =>24\n\nRow8:2 =>26\n\nRow9:2 =>28\n\nRow10:1 =>29\n\nRow11:1 =>30\n\nRow12:1 =>31\n\nRow13:1 =>32\n\nRow14:1 =>33\n\nRow15:0 =>33\n\nRow16:1 =>34.\n\nAh, okay, I see now. So row 17 includes all the Egyptian Premier League goals from rows 1-16 plus own goals? Because own goals are in row16 as 1, which is included in the total of 34. But for our check, we need to ensure that apart from Amr El-Safty (row15), everyone else has at least one goal.\n\nLooking back at all rows except row15 and row17:\n\nRows1-14: All have egyptian premier league goals >=0? Let's see:\n\nRow1:6, yes\n\nRow2:5\n\nRow3:3\n\nRow4:3\n\nRow5:3\n\nRow6:3\n\nRow7:1\n\nRow8:2\n\nRow9:2\n\nRow10:1\n\nRow11:1\n\nRow12:1\n\nRow13:1\n\nRow14:1\n\nSo all of these have at least 1, except row15. So the claim is that Amr El-Safty is the only one with 0.\n\nWait, but what about own goals in row16? They have 1. So does that mean own goals are considered a player? Or is it just an aggregate?\n\nIn any case, the players listed from rows1-15 (except row17) include Amr El-Safty as the only one with 0 in Egyptian Premier League.\n\nSo yes, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Amr El-Safty is the only player who did not score any goals in the Egyptian Premier League holds true. After verifying each player's goal count, it is clear that all other players have scored at least one goal, with Amr El-Safty being the sole exception.\n\n\\boxed{True}",

It has rows with each player's name and their respective goals in three competitions: Egyptian Premier League, Egypt Cup, and CAF Champions League. There's also a total column that sums up all their goals across these competitions.\n\nThe claim is about Gamal Hamza scoring the most goals in the CAF Champions League. So I need to check how many goals he scored there compared to others.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Sherif Ashraf has 0 CAF goals.\n- Row 2: Mahmoud Fathallah also has 0.\n- Row 3: Junior Agogo has 1 CAF goal.\n- Rows 4,5,6: Abdel Halim Ali, Hani Said, Shikabala all have 0 in CAF.\n- Row 7: Gamal Hamza has 2 goals here. That's the highest so far.\n- Rows 8-13 and 15: Most players have 0 or 1 in CAF.\n- Row 14: Wisam El Abdy also has 0, but wait, I think I missed someone.

I need to determine whether the claim \"gamal hamza and junior agogo be the only player to score in at least 1 event\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table structure. The table has rows with each player's name and their scores across three events: Egyptian Premier League, Egypt Cup, and CAF Champions League. Each row also includes a total score which sums up these three.\n\nThe claim states that Gamal Hamza and Junior Agogo are the only players who have scored in at least one event. To verify this, I need to check two things:\n1. Both Gamal Hamza and Junior Agogo have scores greater than zero in at least one of the events.\n2. No other player has a score greater than zero in any of the events.\n\nStarting with point 1, let's look up Gamal Hamza. From row 7, I see he has Egyptian Premier League: 1, Egypt Cup: 0, and CAF Champions League: 2. So his total is 3, which means he scored in two events. Junior Agogo is in row 3 with Egyptian Premier League: 3, Egypt Cup: 0, and CAF Champions League: 1. His total is 4, indicating he scored in two events as well. Therefore, both meet the first condition.\n\nNow, checking point 2. I'll go through each player's scores to see if any other players have a score greater than zero in at least one event. Let's list out each player and their scores:\n\n- Sherif Ashraf (row1): 6,0,0 \u2192 scored in Premier League.\n- Mahmoud Fathallah (row2):5,0,0 \u2192 scored in Premier League.\n- Junior Agogo (row3):3,0,1 \u2192 already counted.\n- Abdel Halim Ali (row4):3,0,0 \u2192 scored in Premier League.\n- Hani Said (row5):3,0,0 \u2192 scored in Premier League.\n- Shikabala (row6):3,0,0 \u2192 scored in Premier League.\n- Gamal Hamza (row7):1,0,2 \u2192 already counted.\n- Ahmed Magdy (row8):2,0,0 \u2192 scored in Premier League.\n- Mostafa Gaafar (row9):2,0,0 \u2192 scored in Premier League.\n- Alaa Kamal (row10):1,0,0 \u2192 scored in Premier League.\n- Mahmoud Samir (row11):1,0,0 \u2192 scored in Premier League.\n- Ricardo Alves Fernandes (row12):1,0,0 \u2192 scored in Premier League.\n- Sabry Raheel (row13):1,0,0 \u2192 scored in Premier League.\n- Wisam El Abdy (row14):1,0,0 \u2192 scored in Premier League.\n- Amr El-Safty (row15):0,0,1 \u2192 scored in CAF Champions League.\n- Own Goals (row16):1,0,0 \u2192 scored in Premier League.\n\nLooking through this list, I notice that several players besides Gamal Hamza and Junior Agogo have scores greater than zero. For example, Sherif Ashraf has 6 goals in the Premier League, Mahmoud Fathallah has 5, and so on. This means the claim is incorrect because there are multiple players who scored in at least one event beyond just Gamal Hamza and Junior Agogo.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells to check are the Egyptian Premier League, Egypt Cup, and CAF Champions League scores for each player.

Let me go row by row:\n\n- Row 1: Sherif Ashraf - 6 goals.\n- Row 2: Mahmoud Fathallah - 5 goals.\n- Row 3: Junior Agogo - 3 goals.\n- Row 4: Abdel Halim Ali - 3 goals.\n- Row 5: Hani Said - 3 goals.\n- Row 6: Shikabala - 3 goals.\n- Row 7: Gamal Hamza - 1 goal.\n- Row 8: Ahmed Magdy - 2 goals.\n- Row 9: Mostafa Gaafar - 2 goals.\n- Row 10: Alaa Kamal - 1 goal.\n- Row 11: Mahmoud Samir - 1 goal.\n- Row 12: Ricardo Alves Fernandes - 1 goal.\n- Row 13: Sabry Raheel - 1 goal.\n- Row 14: Wisam El Abdy - 1 goal.\n- Row 15: Amr El-Safty - 0 goals. So this is one player with zero in the Egyptian Premier League.\n- Row 16: Own Goals - 1 goal (though own goals are a different case, but here it's just another entry).\n- Row 17: Totals - 34 goals.\n\nWait, so only Amr El-Safty has 0 goals in the Egyptian Premier League? Let me double-check each row again. \n\nLooking back:\n\nRows 1 through 14 all have at least 1 goal except for Amr El-Safty (row 15). Row 16 is own goals, which isn't a player but an event. So actually, only one player has 0 goals in the Egyptian Premier League.\n\nBut wait, row 17 is totals and not a player, so it's irrelevant here. Therefore, according to this table, Amr El-Safty is the only player with zero goals in the Egyptian Premier League.\n\nThe claim says he is \"only 1 of 2 players.\" But from the data, there are no other players besides him with 0 in that category. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it's not two players but just one.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be row 15's Egyptian Premier League value (which is 0) and any others that have 0. But since only row 15 has 0, I think those are the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there are two players without goals in the Egyptian Premier League, but only Amr El-Safty has zero. Thus, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"gamal hamza score the second highest goal in the caf champion league\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the structure of the table. Each row represents a player and their goals in different competitions: Egyptian Premier League, Egypt Cup,CAF Champions League, and Total goals. The claim specifically mentions Gamal Hamza and his performance in the CAF Champions League.\n\nSo, I'll start by locating Gamal Hamza's row in the table. Scanning through the rows, I find that Row 7 is for Gamal Hamza. In this row, under the column \"caf champions league,\" the value is 2. That means Gamal scored 2 goals in the CAF Champions League.\n\nNow, to verify if he has the second highest goals, I need to check all the entries in the \"caf champions league\" column and see where 2 stands. Let's go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Sherif Ashraf - 0\n- Row 2: Mahmoud Fathallah - 0\n- Row 3: Junior Agogo - 1\n- Row 4: Abdel Halim Ali - 0\n- Row 5: Hani Said - 0\n- Row 6: Shikabala - 0\n- Row 7: Gamal Hamza - 2 (this is our player)\n- Row 8: Ahmed Magdy - 0\n- Row 9: Mostafa Gaafar - 0\n- Row 10: Alaa Kamal - 0\n- Row 11: Mahmoud Samir - 0\n- Row 12: Ricardo Alves Fernandes - 0\n- Row 13: Sabry Raheel - 0\n- Row 14: Wisam El Abdy - 0\n- Row 15: Amr El-Safty - 1\n- Row 16: Own Goals - 0\n\nLooking at these values, the highest number of goals in the CAF Champions League is 2 (from Gamal Hamza), followed by others having either 1 or 0. Wait, actually, let me check again because I might have missed someone.\n\nWait, looking back, Row 3: Junior Agogo has 1 goal, and Row 15: Amr El-Safty also has 1. So the highest is 2 (Gamal), then the next is 1. But wait, in this table, are there any players with more than 2 goals? Let me check each row again carefully.\n\nRows:\n\n- Row 7: Gamal Hamza - 2\n- All others have either 0 or 1.\n\nSo, in the CAF Champions League column, the highest is 2 (Gamal), and then the next is 1. Therefore, if someone scored 2 goals, that's actually the highest, not second highest. So Gamal Hamza has the highest number of goals in the CAF Champions League according to this table.\n\nThe claim says he scored the second highest. But from the data, it seems he has the highest with 2, so the second highest would be someone with 1 goal. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because Gamal's 2 goals are actually the maximum, not the second.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"second highest.\" Perhaps they mean in terms of total goals across all competitions? Let me check that as well to make sure.\n\nLooking at each player's total goals:\n\n- Sherif Ashraf: 6\n- Mahmoud Fathallah:5\n- Junior Agogo:4\n- Gamal Hamza:3\n- Others have lower totals.\n\nSo in terms of total goals, Gamal has 3, which is the fourth highest. But the claim specifically mentions \"caf champion league,\" so it's about that column, not the overall total.\n\nTherefore, since Gamal has the highest in CAF with 2, and others have less or equal, the claim that he scored second highest is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Gamal Hamza scored the second-highest goals in the CAF Champions League. According to the table, Gamal scored 2 goals, which is the highest among all players listed. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"caf champions league\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
