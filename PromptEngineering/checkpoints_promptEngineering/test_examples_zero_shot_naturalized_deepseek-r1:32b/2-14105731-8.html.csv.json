    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim \"the format of season 6 be q145\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the table. Each row contains information about a specific episode, including details like episode number, season, format, title, and original airdate. The claim in question pertains to season 6, specifically its format being q145.\n\nTo verify this, I need to locate the relevant row(s) corresponding to season 6. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Season 1\n- Row 2: Season 2\n- ...\n- Row 6: Season 6\n\nYes, the sixth row is for season 6. Now, looking at the format column in that row, it shows \"q145\". Therefore, the claim aligns with the information provided in the table.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows related to season 6 or if there's any conflicting information elsewhere. From a quick glance, each season from 1 to 16 is listed once, and no duplicate entries for season 6 exist. This confirms that there's only one entry for season 6 with the format q145.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cell is row index 5 (since rows are zero-indexed starting from 0), specifically the \"format\" column in row 6 (which is row index 5 if counting starts at 0). The format for season 6 is indeed q145, confirming the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"season 6.0 have q245 as its format\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It's stating that season number 6 has a format identifier of \"q245\". So, my task is to check if any episode in season 6 uses this specific format.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- Each row corresponds to an episode with details like episode number, season, format, title, and original airdate.\n- I need to find all entries where the season is 6.0 (though the table shows seasons as integers from 1 to 16).\n  \nScanning through each row:\n- Row 2: Season 2, Format h76\n- Row 3: Season 3, Format q143\n- ...\n- Row 5: Season 5, Format h77\n- Row 6: Season 6, Format q145\n\nWait, in row 6, the season is 6 and the format is q145. The claim mentions \"q245\", which doesn't match q145.\n\nSo, there's no entry where season 6 has a format of q245. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"223 be the only episode number with q147 format.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. It's saying that Episode 223 is the only one in the table that uses the format 'q147'. So I need to check all the episodes and see if any other episodes besides 223 have the 'q147' format.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has an episode number and a format. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 9: Episode 225, season 9, format q147.\nRow 2: Episode 218, season 2, format h76.\nRow 3: Episode 219, season 3, format q143.\nRow 4: Episode 220, season 4, format q144.\nRow 5: Episode 221, season 5, format h77.\nRow 6: Episode 222, season 6, format q145.\nRow 7: Episode 223, season 7, format q146. Wait, no\u2014wait, looking back at the table again. Let me make sure I have this right.\n\nWait, the user provided a list of rows from 1 to 16. So let me go through each row step by step:\n\nRow 1: Episode 217, format h75\nRow 2: Episode 218, format h76\nRow 3: Episode 219, format q143\nRow 4: Episode 220, format q144\nRow 5: Episode 221, format h77\nRow 6: Episode 222, format q145\nRow 7: Episode 223, format q146\nRow 8: Episode 224, format h78\nRow 9: Episode 225, format q147\nRow 10: Episode 226, format h79\nRow 11: Episode 227, format h80\nRow 12: Episode 228, format q148\nRow 13: Episode 229, format q149\nRow 14: Episode 230, format q150\nRow 15: Episode 231, format h81\nRow 16: Episode 232, format h82\n\nWait a second. The claim mentions 'q147' as the format for episode 223, but in my initial reading, I thought row 9 is where q147 is used. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking back at Row 9: \"format: q147\", yes. So Episode 225 has format q147. But the claim says that episode 223 is the only one with q147. That would be incorrect because Episode 225 also uses q147.\n\nWait, no. Wait a minute\u2014I think I made a mistake here. Let me look at each row again carefully:\n\nRow 7: Episode 223 has format q146.\nRow 9: Episode 225 has format q147.\n\nSo the claim is that \"223 be the only episode number with q147 format.\" But in reality, Episode 223 doesn't have format q147. Instead, it's Episode 225 that uses q147. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because 223 isn't using q147; instead, another episode (225) does. Additionally, there might be only one episode with q147.\n\nWait, but according to the table, only Episode 225 has format q147. So if someone claims that 223 is the only episode with q147, that's false because it's actually 225, not 223. Also, is there any other episode besides 225 using q147? From the table, no\u2014only row 9 (Episode 225) has q147.\n\nSo the claim says \"223 be the only episode number with q147 format.\" That's wrong on two counts: first, it's not Episode 223 but 225 that uses q147. Second, regardless of which episode, since there's only one, but if the claim is about 223 being the only one, then it's incorrect because 223 isn't even using q147.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Episode 223 is the only one with format 'q147'. However, checking each row:\n\n- Episode 223 (Row 7) has format 'q146'.\n- Episode 225 (Row 9) uses 'q147'.\n\nThus, Episode 225 is the correct episode with 'q147', and it's the only one. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": \"false\"\n}\n```",
