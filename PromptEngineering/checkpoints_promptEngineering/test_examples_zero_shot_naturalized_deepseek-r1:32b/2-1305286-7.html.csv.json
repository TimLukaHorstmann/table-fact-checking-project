    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"susan sarandon be the winner nominee in 2001\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. The user is stating that Susan Sarandon was a winner or a nominee in 2001. So I need to check the table for any entries related to Susan Sarandon in the year 2001.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 1: 1997, favorite movie actress, Harriet the Spy, Rosie O'Donnell nominated.\nRow 2: 1999, favorite movie, Rugrats Movie, N/A won.\nRow 3: 2001, favorite voice from an animated movie, Rugrats in Paris, Susan Sarandon won.\nRow 4: 2004, favorite voice from an animated movie, Rugrats Go Wild, Bruce Willis nominated.\nRow 5: 2005, favorite movie actor, Lemony Snicket, Jim Carrey nominated.\nRow 6: 2007, favorite movie actor, Nacho Libre, Jack Black nominated.\nRow 7: 2007, favorite movie actress, Charlotte's Web, Dakota Fanning won.\nRow 8: 2012, favorite voice from an animated movie, Rango, Johnny Depp nominated.\n\nFrom Row 3, I see that in 2001, Susan Sarandon was the winner. The result column says \"won\", which means she was indeed the winner, not just a nominee. \n\nThe claim states \"winner nominee\", but since she won, she was automatically a nominee as well. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells are in Row 3 for year, category, film, winner/nominee(s), and result.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"film\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner / nominee(s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"bruce willis be nominate for the film rugrats go wild\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim. The subject is Bruce Willis and the action is being nominated for a specific film titled Rugrats Go Wild.\n\nLooking through the table rows:\n\n- Row 1: Not relevant because it's about Rosie O'Donnell in 1997.\n- Row 2: This row is about a different film, The Rugrats Movie, but the winner/nominee is N/A and the result was won. Doesn't mention Bruce Willis.\n- Row 3: Susan Sarandon won for Rugrats in Paris: The Movie in 2001. Not relevant.\n- Row 4: Here's the key row. It mentions the year 2004, category \"favorite voice from an animated movie\", film \"rugrats go wild\", winner/nominee is Bruce Willis, and result is \"nominated\".\n  \nSo the claim states that Bruce Willis was nominated for Rugrats Go Wild. According to Row 4, he was indeed nominated in 2004 under that category.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cell is in Row 4.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"film\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winner  / nominee  (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the winner / nominee(s) of the 2007 favorite movie actor be rosie o'donnell.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the table to find entries from the year 2007. Scanning the years listed:\n\n- Row 1: 1997\n- Row 2: 1999\n- Row 3: 2001\n- Row 4: 2004\n- Row 5: 2005\n- Rows 6 and 7: 2007\n- Row 8: 2012\n\nSo, rows 6 and 7 are from 2007. Now, the claim mentions \"favorite movie actor,\" so I need to look for a row where both the year is 2007 and the category is \"favorite movie actor.\" Let's check each relevant row:\n\n- Row 5: Year 2005, category \"favorite movie actor.\" That's not 2007.\n- Rows 6 and 7 are from 2007. Looking at their categories:\n   - Row 6: Category is \"favorite movie actor.\"\n   - Row 7: Category is \"favorite movie actress.\"\n\nSo, the relevant row for the claim is row 6 because it's the only one with year 2007 and category \"favorite movie actor.\" \n\nNow, looking at the nominees/winners in that row (row 6), the winner/nominee(s) listed are \"jack black,\" not \"rosie o'donnell.\" The result for this entry is \"nominated,\" meaning Jack Black was a nominee but didn't win. \n\nThe claim says Rosie O'Donnell was the winner or nominee, but according to row 6, it's Jack Black who was nominated in that category and year. There's no mention of Rosie O'Donnell in any 2007 entries related to \"favorite movie actor.\" She does appear in row 1 as a nominee for \"favorite movie actress\" in 1997, but not in 2007 for the actor category.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because Rosie O'Donnell wasn't associated with that specific award and year. The correct nominee was Jack Black.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the 2007 favorite movie actor nomination went to Jack Black, not Rosie O'Donnell.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"winner  / nominee  (s)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"the result of the 1999 favorite movie be nominate\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asking. It seems like there's a typo in the claim: \"be\" might have been intended as \"was\". So, the corrected claim would likely be \"the result of the 1999 favorite movie was nominate.\" Alternatively, it could mean that the result for the 1999 favorite movie category was a nomination.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an entry with details like year, category, film, winner/nominee(s), and result. My goal is to find the relevant information from the table that pertains to the claim.\n\nThe claim mentions the year 1999 and the category \"favorite movie.\" So I'll scan through the table rows for entries where the year is 1999 and the category is \"favorite movie.\"\n\nLooking at Row 2: Year is 1999, Category is favorite movie. The result here is \"won.\" \n\nWait, that's interesting because the claim says the result was \"nominate,\" which likely means nominated. But in the table, under Row 2, the result is listed as \"won,\" not nominated. That suggests a discrepancy.\n\nSo, according to the table, in 1999 for the category of favorite movie, the film \"The Rugrats Movie\" won, meaning it was the winner, not just nominated. Therefore, the claim that the result was \"nominate\" (i.e., nominated) is incorrect.\n\nHence, the claim should be FALSE because the result in 1999 for favorite movie was a win, not a nomination.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the result of the 1999 favorite movie category was a nomination. However, according to Row 2, the film won the category. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
