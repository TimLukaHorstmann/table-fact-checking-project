    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"there be only 2 occasion when a team drew and it have a goal difference of 34 - 25 and 36 - 29.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down what the claim is saying. It mentions two things:\n1. There are only two occasions where a team drew (i.e., the 'drawn' column has a value greater than zero).\n2. In these two cases, the goal differences are specifically 34 - 25 and 36 - 29.\n\nI'll start by examining each row of the table to find entries where 'drawn' is not zero because the claim is about teams that drew. Looking at each row:\n\n- Row 1: drawn=0 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- Row 2: drawn=0 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- Row 3: drawn=0 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- Row 4: drawn=1 \u2192 Relevant.\n- Row 5: drawn=1 \u2192 Relevant.\n- Rows 6,7,8: drawn=0 or other values \u2192 Not relevant.\n\nSo, only Rows 4 and 5 have a 'drawn' value greater than zero. Now, let's check their goal differences:\n\n- Row 4: Goal difference is 34 -25.\n- Row 5: Goal difference is 36 -29.\n\nThe claim mentions exactly these two goal differences. Therefore, the claim is correct as both conditions are satisfied in only those two rows where a team drew.\n\nTo ensure there are no other such cases, I'll scan through all rows again. Rows 1-3 have zero draws and thus don't meet the first condition. Rows 6-8 either have zero draws or different goal differences that don't match 34-25 or 36-29.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE because only two teams drew with exactly those goal differences.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the claim \"when the goal difference be 11 - 71 the point be 0\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It has rows with several columns: games, drawn, lost, goal difference, and points. Each row represents some data, possibly from a sports league where teams have played a certain number of games, with draws, losses, a specific goal difference, and accumulated points.\n\nThe claim is about a specific condition: when the goal difference is 11-71, then the points should be 0. So I'm looking for any row in the table where the goal difference exactly matches 11 - 71, and check if the corresponding points are indeed 0.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Goal difference is 51-10 \u2192 Not matching.\nRow 2: Goal difference is 40-13 \u2192 Not matching.\nRow 3: Goal difference is 41-19 \u2192 Not matching.\nRow 4: Goal difference is 34-25 \u2192 Not matching.\nRow 5: Goal difference is 36-29 \u2192 Not matching.\nRow 6: Goal difference is 32-27 \u2192 Not matching.\nRow 7: Goal difference is 17-68 \u2192 Close but not exactly 11-71. Points here are 2, which doesn't match the claim's expected 0 points either.\nRow 8: Finally, row 8 has a goal difference of 11-71, and the points are 0.\n\nSo, in row 8, when the goal difference is exactly 11 - 71, the points column shows 0. This directly supports the claim. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI should also make sure that there are no other rows with the same goal difference to confirm it's unique. Scanning through, I see that row 8 is the only one with a goal difference of 11-71, so this is the only relevant cell to consider for the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because in row 8, where the goal difference is 11 - 71, the points are indeed 0.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"there be never a time when point be greater than 12 and only 1 occasion when the point be less than 2.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. There is never a time when points are greater than 12.\n2. Only one occasion where points are less than 2.\n\nI'll need to check each row of the table to verify these conditions.\n\nLooking at the \"points\" column for each row:\n\n- Row 1: Points = 12\n- Row 2: Points = 12\n- Row 3: Points = 10\n- Row 4: Points = 7\n- Row 5: Points = 7\n- Row 6: Points = 6\n- Row 7: Points = 2\n- Row 8: Points = 0\n\nFor the first part, checking if any points are greater than 12. From the data above, the highest points in any row is 12. So no points exceed 12. That means the first condition holds true.\n\nNow for the second part: Only one occasion when points are less than 2. Let's see which rows have points less than 2. \n\nLooking at each row:\n- Row 7 has points = 2, which is not less than 2.\n- Row 8 has points = 0, which is less than 2.\n\nSo only one row (Row 8) meets the condition of having points less than 2.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me read through everything carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"when the point be 12 the goal difference be 51 - 10 and 40 - 13\". So, it's stating that when points are 12, the goal differences should be both 51-10 and 40-13.\n\nLooking at the table, there are two rows where points are 12. Let me check each of them:\n\nRow 1: Points = 12, Goal Difference = 51 - 10\nRow 2: Points = 12, Goal Difference = 40 - 13\n\nSo both goal differences mentioned in the claim (51-10 and 40-13) are present when the points are 12. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI'll note the relevant cells as row indexes 0 and 1 for 'points' to show where the 12 points are located, but actually, I should include all columns mentioned in the claim, which includes both 'points' and 'goal difference'. So each relevant cell will be from these two rows, specifically looking at 'points' and 'goal difference'.\n\nWait, the instructions say to list each cell that's relevant. So for row 0 (index 1), points is 12 and goal difference is 51-10. For row 1 (index 2?), wait no\u2014rows are 1-based or 0? The user example shows row indices starting at 0, so Row 1 would be index 0. Wait, the table given has rows as Row 1 to Row 8. So in code terms, if they're numbered from 1, but JSON is 0-indexed. Hmm, no\u2014the user's naturalized format lists them as Row 1, Row 2, etc., but when converting to a list for JSON, row indices would be 0-based. Wait, the example given has {\"row_index\": 0}, which refers to the first row in their data.\n\nWait, looking back: The table is presented with Row 1, Row 2, up to Row 8. So in the context of the JSON output, if we consider the rows as starting from index 0 for the first row (Row 1), then:\n\n- Row 1 is index 0\n- Row 2 is index 1\n- etc.\n\nSo when the claim refers to points being 12, looking at Rows 1 and 2 in naturalized format, which are indexes 0 and 1 in JSON.\n\nEach of these rows has points=12. So for each row where points=12, we check their goal difference.\n\nIn Row 1 (index 0): Goal Difference is 51-10\nIn Row 2 (index 1): Goal Difference is 40-13\n\nSo both are as per the claim. Therefore, the relevant cells would include:\n\nFor each row where points=12, their 'points' and 'goal difference'.\n\nSo in JSON terms:\n\nRow indices 0 and 1, columns 'points' and 'goal difference'.\n\nThus, four entries in relevant_cells: two for points (row 0 and 1) and two for goal differences (same rows).\n\nWait, but looking back at the user's example, each object is a cell, so if we need to show all cells that were checked. So for both rows where points=12, I need to include their 'points' column as well as 'goal difference'.\n\nSo:\n\nFor row index 0:\n- \"column_name\": \"points\"\n- \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"\n\nSame for row index 1.\n\nThus, the relevant_cells would be four objects:\n\n{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"}.\n\nBut wait, in the user's example, it's only two objects: row 0 Revenue and row 1 Employees. So perhaps for each condition met, we just include the cells that support the claim.\n\nIn this case, since both rows have points=12 and their respective goal differences, I need to list all four cells (two points and two goal differences) because they are the ones supporting the claim.\n\nBut perhaps the user's example is simplified. Alternatively, maybe it's sufficient to include each row where the condition is met, pointing out that in those rows, both 'points' being 12 and their respective 'goal difference' match the claim.\n\nSo the answer would be TRUE, as all conditions are satisfied.\n\nThus, compiling the relevant cells:\n\n- For row index 0 (Row 1), 'points' is 12, so include that cell.\n- For row index 0, 'goal difference' is 51-10, which matches part of the claim.\n- For row index 1 (Row 2), 'points' is also 12, include that cell.\n- For row index 1, 'goal difference' is 40-13, which matches the other part.\n\nTherefore, four cells in total. So the relevant_cells list would have these four entries.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim mentions a specific goal difference of 11-71 and states that the points should be 1 in that case. So, I need to look for any row in the table where the goal difference matches this exactly and then check if the corresponding points are indeed 1.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nRow 1: games:7, drawn:0, lost:1, goal difference:51-10, points:12\nRow 2: games:7, drawn:0, lost:1, goal difference:40-13, points:12\nRow 3: games:7, drawn:0, lost:2, goal difference:41-19, points:10\nRow 4: games:7, drawn:1, lost:3, goal difference:34-25, points:7\nRow 5: games:7, drawn:1, lost:3, goal difference:36-29, points:7\nRow 6: games:7, drawn:0, lost:4, goal difference:32-27, points:6\nRow 7: games:7, drawn:0, lost:6, goal difference:17-68, points:2\nRow 8: games:7, drawn:0, lost:7, goal difference:11-71, points:0\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to find if any have a goal difference of 11-71. Scanning the rows:\n\n- Row 1 has 51-10.\n- Row 2 has 40-13.\n- Row 3 has 41-19.\n- Row 4 has 34-25.\n- Row 5 has 36-29.\n- Row 6 has 32-27.\n- Row 7 has 17-68.\n- Row 8 has 11-71.\n\nAh, here we go. In row 8, the goal difference is exactly 11-71 as mentioned in the claim. So that's the relevant row. Now, looking at the points column for this row: it says 0, not 1 as the claim suggests. \n\nSo according to the table, when the goal difference is 11-71, the points are 0, which contradicts the claim stating the points should be 1. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data in the table.\n\nI'll also check if there's any other row with a similar or identical goal difference to ensure I haven't missed anything.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if the claim \"there be 2 time when the point be greater than 12 and no time when the point be less than 2\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. There are 8 rows, each representing a team's performance with several columns: games, drawn, lost, goal difference, and points.\n\nThe claim has two parts:\n1. There are two times when the points are greater than 12.\n2. There is no time when the points are less than 2.\n\nI'll need to check each row for these conditions.\n\nLooking at each row's points:\n\n- Row 1: 12 points\n- Row 2: 12 points\n- Row 3: 10 points\n- Row 4: 7 points\n- Row 5: 7 points\n- Row 6: 6 points\n- Row 7: 2 points\n- Row 8: 0 points\n\nFor the first part of the claim, points greater than 12. I see that both Row 1 and Row 2 have 12 points each. However, the claim says \"greater than\" 12, not equal to. So these rows don't satisfy the condition. Are there any other rows with points over 12? Let's check again: all others are below or equal to 12. So there are zero instances where points exceed 12.\n\nThe second part of the claim states that there is no time when points are less than 2. Looking at Row 8, it has 0 points, which is less than 2. Therefore, this condition isn't met either.\n\nSince neither part of the claim holds true\u2014there aren't two instances with more than 12 points and there is a case where points are below 2\u2014the claim must be FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells that support this conclusion. For each row's 'points' column:\n\n- Rows 1 and 2 have points equal to 12.\n- Row 8 has points equal to 0, which is less than 2.\n\nThese are the relevant cells because they directly relate to whether the claim conditions are met or not.\n</think>\n\nThe claim requires checking if any team has more than 12 points (which none do) and ensuring no team has fewer than 2 points (but Row 8 does). Thus, both parts of the claim fail.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"there be 3 times when the point be 7 and the number of loss be 3 each time.\" So I need to check if there are three rows where both points equal 7 and losses equal 3.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row one by one and note down the points and losses. \n\nRow 1: Points = 12, Losses = 1 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nRow 2: Points = 12, Losses = 1 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nRow 3: Points = 10, Losses = 2 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nRow 4: Points = 7, Losses = 3 \u2192 This matches.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"when the point be 13, the goal difference be 51 - 10 and 40 - 13.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim is referring to. It seems like it's saying that when a team has 13 points, their goal differences are both 51-10 and 40-13. Wait, but in the table, I don't see any row with 13 points. Let me check each row's points column.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Points are 12.\nRow 2: Also 12 points.\nRow 3: 10 points.\nRows 4 and 5: Both have 7 points.\nRow 6: 6 points.\nRow 7: 2 points.\nAnd Row 8: 0 points.\n\nSo none of the rows have 13 points. That's a problem because if there are no teams with 13 points, how can their goal differences be as stated? But maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Let me read it again.\n\nThe claim says \"when the point be 13, the goal difference be 51-10 and 40-13.\" It sounds like it's making a conditional statement: if a team has 13 points, then their goal differences must include both 51-10 and 40-13. But since there are no teams with 13 points in the table, does that mean the claim is automatically FALSE? Or maybe the claim is trying to say that for some teams with certain points, those goal differences exist.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim isn't about having both goal differences when the points are 13, but rather that there are two different goal differences (51-10 and 40-13) when the points could be 13. But looking at the table again, Rows 1 and 2 both have 12 points each with their respective goal differences.\n\nWait, Row 1 has a goal difference of 51-10 and 12 points.\nRow 2 has 40-13 and also 12 points.\n\nSo if someone is claiming that when the points are 13, these two goal differences exist, but in reality, both have 12 points. So actually, there's no team with 13 points, so the claim is not supported by the data. Therefore, it should be FALSE.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The claim might just be stating that for a point value of 13, those two goal differences are present. But since in our table, the maximum points any team has is 12, there's no case where points equal 13. Therefore, the conditions cannot be met, making the claim FALSE.\n\nBut wait another angle: maybe the claim is saying that for any instance where a team has either of those goal differences (51-10 or 40-13), their points would be 13. But in the table, both these goal differences correspond to 12 points, not 13. So if someone claims that when you have those goal diffs, the points are 13, but in reality, it's 12, then the claim is FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is misstated and should be \"when the point is 12\", which would make sense because two teams have 12 points with those specific goal differences. But as written, the claim mentions 13 points, so it doesn't hold.\n\nSo putting it all together: The table shows that for points=12, there are two teams with goal differences of 51-10 and 40-13. Since the claim specifies points=13, which isn't present in the table, and no team has those goal differences at 13 points, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells: For both rows that have goal differences of 51-10 and 40-13 (Rows 1 and 2), I need their points. So the columns would be \"goal difference\" and \"points\". Therefore, the relevant cells are Row 1's goal difference and points, and Row 2's goal difference and points.\n\nSo the JSON should reflect that.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that when a team has 13 points, their goal differences are 51-10 and 40-13. However, examining the table, no teams have 13 points; instead, two teams with 12 points have those goal differences. Thus, the claim is false because it incorrectly associates these goal differences with 13 points.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
