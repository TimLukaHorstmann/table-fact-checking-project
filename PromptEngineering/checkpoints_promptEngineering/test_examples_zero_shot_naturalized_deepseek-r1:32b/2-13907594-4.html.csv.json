    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"5 - 4 (ot) be the score that have a location and attendance of montreal forum and the date after may 10.\"\n\nBreaking it down:\n1. The score must be 5-4 (OT).\n2. The location/attendance should be Montreal Forum.\n3. The date should be after May 10.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row in the table to check these conditions.\n\nLooking at Row 7: \n- Date is May 10, opponent is Bruins, score is 5-4 (OT), location is Montreal Forum, series is MTL 4-3.\nThe date here is exactly May 10, not after. So it doesn't satisfy the third condition about being after May 10.\n\nLooking through all other rows:\nRow 1: April 26\nRow 2: April 28\nRow 3: May 1\nRow 4: May 3\nRow 5: May 5\nRow 6: May 8\nNone of these have a score of 5-4 (OT) except Row 7, which is on May 10.\n\nSo the claim says \"the date after may 10,\" but there are no rows with a date after May 10. Therefore, there's no row that meets all three conditions.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the only game with a score of 5-4 (OT) at Montreal Forum was on May 10, not after.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
