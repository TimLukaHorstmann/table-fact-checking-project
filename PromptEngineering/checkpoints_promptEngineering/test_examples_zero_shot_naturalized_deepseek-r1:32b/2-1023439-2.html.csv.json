    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding what the claim says.\n\nThe claim is: \"during 1986, 6 be the value for us dance when the value of us r&b be 9\". Hmm, that's a bit awkwardly phrased, but I think it means that in the year 1986, if the US R&B value is 9, then the US Dance value should be 6.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table to find all entries from 1986. The rows for 1986 are row 3 and row 4. \n\nRow 3: Year 1986, Title under the influence, US dance is 6, US R&B is 9.\nRow 4: Year 1986, Title animals, but all values (US, US R&B, US Dance) are missing, denoted by '-'.\n\nSo, in row 3, when US R&B is 9, the US Dance value is indeed 6. That seems to match the claim directly. \n\nBut wait, there's another entry for 1986 in row 4 where both US R&B and US Dance are missing. Does that affect the claim? The claim specifies a condition when US R&B is 9, so I think we only need to consider rows where US R&B is 9.\n\nLooking back at row 3: It meets the condition (US R&B = 9) and has US Dance as 6. So that's exactly what the claim states. The other row for 1986 doesn't have a value for US R&B, so it doesn't apply to this specific condition.\n\nTherefore, based on the relevant cells in row 3, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the 1986 entries where US R&B is 9 and confirming that US Dance is 6. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us r&b\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"under the influence chart at 56 in the us in 1985 and 1986\". \n\nFirst, let me parse this claim carefully. It says that \"under the influence\" charted at position 56 in the US during both 1985 and 1986.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\n- The table has rows for each year from 1984 to 1988, with some entries missing (denoted by '-').\n\nLet me check each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1: 1984** - Title is \"pretty mess\". US chart position is 75. Not relevant for the claim since it's about 1984, not 1985 or 1986.\n\n2. **Row 2: 1985** - Title is \"mechanical emotion\". US chart position is 107. The claim mentions 56 in 1985 and 1986. So, the US position here doesn't match; it's 107, not 56.\n\n3. **Row 3: 1986** - Title is \"under the influence\". Here, the US chart position is 56. This matches part of the claim for 1986.\n\n4. **Row 4: 1986** - Title is \"animals\". US, US R&B, and US Dance positions are all '-'. So, no data here, irrelevant to the claim.\n\n5. **Row 5: 1988** - Title is \"undress\", all chart positions are '-', so not relevant.\n\nNow, putting it together:\n\n- The claim states that \"under the influence\" charted at 56 in both 1985 and 1986.\n  \nLooking at the data:\n- In 1985: There's a different title (\"mechanical emotion\") with US chart position 107, not 56. So no entry for \"under the influence\" in 1985.\n- In 1986: The title \"under the influence\" does have a US chart position of 56.\n\nSo, the claim is incorrect because it states that both 1985 and 1986 had \"under the influence\" at 56. However, in 1985, \"mechanical emotion\" was at 107, and there's no entry for \"under the influence\". Therefore, only part of the claim is true (the 1986 part), but since it claims both years, the overall statement is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- For 1985: Row 2, US column.\n- For 1986: Row 3, US column.\n\nThese cells show that in 1985, \"under the influence\" wasn't charted at 56 (it's not even listed as a title there), and in 1986 it was at 56. Since the claim asserts both years, but only one is correct, the entire statement is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
