    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the warrington town team be in the 4th position with 45 goal against\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is referring to. The claim has two main points: \n1. Warrington Town's position is 4th.\n2. They have 45 goals against.\n\nI'll start by looking through the table to find the row where the team is \"Warrington Town.\" Scanning the rows, I see that Row 4 lists \"warrington town\" as the team. \n\nNext, I need to verify two pieces of information from this row:\n- Position: The position column for Warrington Town shows \"position: 4,\" which matches the claim. So, the first part is correct.\n- Goals Against: Looking at the goals against statistic in the same row, it's listed as 45. This also aligns with what the claim states.\n\nSince both pieces of information from the claim are accurately reflected in Row 4 of the table, the claim holds true. \n\nI should note that all other aspects not mentioned in the claim don't affect its validity here. The key is to focus solely on whether Warrington Town is indeed in 4th position and if they have exactly 45 goals against. Both conditions are satisfied according to the data provided.\n\nTherefore, after carefully checking each relevant cell in the table, I can confidently determine that the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Warrington Town is in 4th position and has 45 goals against as per the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goals against\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
