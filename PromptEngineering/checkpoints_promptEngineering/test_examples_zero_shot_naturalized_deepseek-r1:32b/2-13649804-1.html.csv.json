    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to verify the claim: \"the highest championship score be 284 by steve brady in 1993.\" Let's go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll check if there's a row for Steve Brady in 1993. Scanning through the table, I see that in 1993, the champion is Steve Brady with a score of 284. That matches part of the claim.\n\nNext, I need to confirm if this is indeed the highest score. Looking at other years around 1993, especially nearby years like 1992 and 1994 (though there's no data for 1994). In 1992, Bill Loeffler scored 283, which is lower than 284. For 1993, Steve Brady's score is the highest in that row.\n\nI also need to check if any other years have a higher score than 284. Going through the table from top to bottom:\n\n- Years before 1990: Scores are mostly around 200s and some lower.\n- From 1990 onwards, scores increase. For example, in 1993 it's 284, but looking further down:\n   - In 1991, Kim Thompson has 278.\n   - Later years like 1990s and early 2000s don't show higher than 284.\n\nWait a minute, I notice that in the later part of the table (rows after 1993), there are scores like 284 in 1993, but then looking further down, for instance, in row 25 (year 1989) it's Mike West with 210, which is lower. So 284 seems to be the highest score mentioned.\n\nHowever, I need to ensure that there isn't a higher score elsewhere. Let me double-check all rows:\n\n- The highest scores are in the range of 278 to 284. Steve Brady's 284 in 1993 is indeed the highest listed. There's no score above 284 in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"the highest championship score be 284 by steve brady in 1993\" is accurate based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is that \"the lowest championship score be a tie between John Jackson and Webb Heintzelman at 205.\" I need to verify if this statement is true based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the relevant columns needed for verification. The key points in the claim are the scores of specific champions. So, the \"Champion\" column will help me find John Jackson and Webb Heintzelman. The \"Score\" column will provide their respective scores to check if both have 205.\n\nNext, I'll go through each row in the table to look for these two names.\n\nStarting with John Jackson: I scan down the rows until I find his name. At row 34 (1980), it shows he's the champion with a score of 205. So that's one instance of a 205 score.\n\nNow, looking for Webb Heintzelman: Continuing through the table, I reach row 26 (1988) where he is listed as the champion with a score of 205 as well. That's another 205 score.\n\nSo far, both John Jackson and Webb Heintzelman have scores of 205. But to confirm if this is indeed the lowest score, I need to ensure no one else has a lower score than 205.\n\nI'll review the rest of the table starting from row 34 going backward (since earlier years might have lower scores). Checking each \"Score\" column:\n\n- 1979: Loren Roberts - 212\n- 1980: John Jackson - 205 (already noted)\n- 1981: Ted O'Rourke - 210\n- 1982: Darrell Kestner - 213\n- 1983: Victor Tortorici - 214\n- 1984: Fred Funk - 206 (lower than 205)\nWait, Fred Funk's score is 206 in 1984, which is higher than 205 but not lower. So no one has a lower score.\n\nLooking further back:\n\n- 1978: Larry Griffin - 209\n- 1977: Mike Zack - 209\n\nContinuing down (to earlier years):\n\n- 1985: John Fiedler - 211\n- 1986: Robert Thompson - 209\n- 1987: Darrell Kestner - 210\n- 1989: Mike West - 210\n- 1990: Steve Gotsche - 205 (another 205)\nWait, Steve Gotsche in 1990 has a score of 205. That's another champion with the same low score.\n\nSo now we have three champions with a score of 205: John Jackson (1980), Webb Heintzelman (1988), and Steve Gotsche (1990). Therefore, the lowest championship score isn't just between John and Webb but includes Steve as well. The claim states it's a tie between only John and Webb, which is incomplete because Steve also has the same low score.\n\nThus, the claim is not fully accurate since there are three champions tied at 205, not just two. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"Champion\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"Champion\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It seems like it's stating that there are four championships held in La Quinta, California between the years 1991 and 1994.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year with details about the champion, venue, location, and score. So I need to check how many entries fall within the specified time frame (1991-1994) and are located in La Quinta, California.\n\nLet me go through the relevant rows:\n\n- 1991: Row index 23? Wait, let's recount because sometimes the initial count might be off. Let me check from the top. Starting at row 0 for 1980 up to row 36 for 1977.

Let me list all rows with location \"la quinta , california\":\n\n- Row index 21: year 1992, location la quinta\n- Row index 20: year 1993? Wait no, perhaps the years are listed from higher to lower.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me check each row:\n\nLooking at the user's table:\n\nThe first rows (indices 0-7) cover years 1984 down to 1977. Then, there's a jump to earlier years in the later rows? Or perhaps the table is ordered by year descending.\n\nWait no, looking back, perhaps I miscounted the rows.\n\nLet me start from the top:\n\nRow index 0: 1984\nRow 1: 1983\n...\nRow 7: 1977\n\nThen, row 8 would be earlier than 1977? Or perhaps it's a different structure. Wait, no\u2014looking at the user's data:\n\nThe table starts with row index 0 as \"year: 1984\", then row 1 is \"year: 1983\", and so on until row 7 which is \"year: 1977\".\n\nThen, rows beyond that seem to be earlier years. Wait no\u2014actually, looking at the data:\n\nRow index 0: year 1984\nRow 1: year 1983\n...\nRow 7: 1977\n\nWait, but in the user's message, the table continues beyond row 36 with more years. So perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to look for all entries where location is \"la quinta , california\" and year between 1991-1994.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow index 21: year 1992\nRow index 20: 1993? Or perhaps I'm miscounting the years.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to note that in the user-provided table, rows with location \"la quinta , california\" are for years 1991, 1992, and another year. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at each row where location is \"la quinta , california\":\n\n- Row index 22: year 1991\n- Row index 23: 1990 \u2014 no, that's brockton.\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the indices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to note that in the table, there are four entries for La Quinta between 1991 and 1994. But when I check:\n\nLooking at each row with location \"la quinta , california\":\n\n- Row index 20: year 1993\n- Row index 21: year 1992\n- Row index 22: year 1991\n- And another one, perhaps in 1994?\n\nWait, but looking through the table, I see:\n\nRow index 20: 1993, location la quinta\nRow index 21: 1992, same location\nRow index 22: 1991, same location\nAnd perhaps another one in 1994?\n\nWait, does the table include a row for 1994? Let me check.\n\nLooking through all rows, I don't see any entry for 1994. The latest year is 1984 in row 0, and then going down to 1977 in row 36.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the user's table includes years from 1984 down to 1977, but also earlier years like 1991, 1992, etc. Wait no, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the order.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is ordered with more recent years first, so row 0 is 1984, and then each subsequent row goes further back in time. So rows towards the end of the table have earlier years like 1977.\n\nIn that case, looking for years 1991-1994 would require checking if those years are present in the table. But from the data provided by the user, I don't see any entries beyond 1984; the earliest year is 1977.\n\nWait, this suggests that there might be a mistake in my understanding of the table's structure. Perhaps the table includes all years from 1984 down to 1977 and then continues with earlier years up to, say, 1960 or something.\n\nBut given the user's data, I can only go by what's provided. From the initial rows (indices 0-7), we have 1984 down to 1977. Then, in rows beyond that, perhaps there are earlier years, but it's unclear without more information.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to note that based on the user's data, there are three entries for La Quinta between 1991 and 1993 (years 1991, 1992, 1993) but no entry for 1994. Therefore, there aren't four entries as claimed.\n\nBut since the user mentioned that they are looking for an answer to a question about a task involving counting such entries, perhaps the correct count is three.\n\nHowever, without a clear table structure and complete data, it's challenging to provide an accurate count. But assuming that in the table provided by the user, there are four instances where the location is \"la quinta , california\" and the year falls between 1991 and 1994 inclusive, then the answer would be four.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the task, we were asked to count the number of entries in a table where the location is \"La Quinta, California\" and the year falls between 1991 and 1994. Upon examining the data provided:\n\n- The years 1991, 1992, and 1993 each have an entry for \"La Quinta, California.\"\n- There is no entry for the year 1994 in this location.\n\nTherefore, there are **three** such entries within the specified range.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"all score from 1996 - 2013 be atcourses in port st lucie, florida\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that all scores (I assume they mean all the events) between the years 1996 and 2013 took place at courses in Port St. Lucie, Florida. So I need to check each row in the table for these years and see if their locations match.\n\nLooking at the table, rows are indexed from 0 to 37 (since there are 38 entries). The claim is about the period 1996-2013, so I should focus on the years within that range. Let's list out which rows correspond to those years.\n\nFrom row 0: 2013\nRow 1: 2012 (but not in our range)\nWait, actually, looking at the table provided:\n\nRows from 0 to 27 cover the years from 1984 up. Wait no, let me check again. The rows start from 1977 and go up to 2013. So for 1996-2013, I need to find all rows where the year is between 1996 and 2013.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: 2013\nRow 1: 2012? Wait no, actually, in the table provided, it's from 1977 up to 2013. Let me check how many rows there are. It looks like the table has 38 entries (rows 0 to 37). So the years go from 1977 (row 37) up to 2013 (row 0). Wait, that might be confusing because row 0 is the most recent year, 2013. Let me clarify:\n\nRow indices and their corresponding years:\n\nRow 0: 2013\nRow 1: 2012\n...\nWait no, actually in the table provided, each row has a 'year' value. Wait, looking back at the user's message, the table is listed with rows from 1977 up to 2013. So row 0 is 1977? Or does it start from the top as 2013?\n\nWait, no. Looking carefully: The first entry in the table is \"You are tasked...\". Then, under that, the user provided a list of rows starting with \"Row 0\" having year 2013, and each subsequent row goes down by one year until row 37 which is 1977. So the years go from 2013 (row 0) to 1977 (row 37). Therefore, for the period 1996-2013, I need to find all rows where the year is between 1996 and 2013. \n\nSo let's figure out which rows correspond to each year in that range.\n\nStarting from row 0 (2013), then row 1 would be 2012, row 2: 2011, ..., down to the year 1996. Let me calculate how many years are between 1996 and 2013 inclusive.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2013 is 18 years (including both endpoints). So rows 0 to 17 would cover from 2013 down to 1996. Wait, no: row 0 is 2013, row 1 is 2012, ..., row 17 would be 2013-17=1996. So rows 0 through 17 correspond to years 2013 down to 1996.\n\nSo I need to check each of these 18 rows (rows 0 to 17) and see if their locations are Port St. Lucie, Florida.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 0: Year 2013, Location: port st lucie, florida\nRow 1: 2012, same location\n...\nI can check each row from 0 to 17.\n\nWait, but in the provided table, rows are listed as follows. Let me list them:\n\nRows 0-27 (but let's confirm):\n\nThe table entries go from 2013 down to 1984 (row 27). Then rows 28-37 are years 1983 down to 1977? Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nWait the user provided a list where each row is listed as \"Row x: year ...\". So from row 0 to row 37, the years go from 2013 (row 0) down to 1977 (row 37). Therefore, for 1996-2013, rows 0 (2013) to row 17 (1996).\n\nNow, let's check each of these rows:\n\nRow 0: 2013 - port st lucie\nRow 1: 2012 - same\n...\nBut wait, looking at the provided table data, I can see that starting from row 0 to row 27, the locations alternate between \"port st lucie, florida\" and \"other places\". Let me check each one.\n\nWait no, actually, in the table provided by the user, rows are listed with their details. So let's list them:\n\nRow 0: year=2013, location=port st lucie\nRow 1: year=2012, same\n...\nBut wait, looking at the actual data provided earlier, each row has a \"Location\" field. Let me recount from the user's message.\n\nWait in the initial problem description, the table is presented as follows:\n\nRows are listed with their details like \"You are tasked...\", then under that, rows 0-37 with their year and location.\n\nBut in this context, perhaps it's better to just check each row for years between 1996-2013. So rows 0 (2013) down to row 17 (1996). Let me check each of these:\n\nRow 0: Year=2013, Location=port st lucie\nRow 1: Year=2012, same location\nRow 2: 2011, same\n...\nWait, but in the provided table, I need to look for any row between 1996-2013 that has a different location.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFrom row 0 (2013) down to row 17 (1996), all these rows have \"port st lucie, florida\" as their location. Therefore, all scores from 1996 to 2013 are indeed in Port St. Lucie.\n\nWait a second\u2014am I sure about that? Let me check the table again carefully. For example, row 17 would be year=1996. Does it have the same location?\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nRow 0: port st lucie\n...\nRow 17: Let's see, if each row decrements by one year, then row 17 is 2013-17=1996.\n\nYes, all rows from 0 to 17 have location \"port st lucie, florida\". Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that all events from 1996 to 2013 took place in Port St. Lucie, Florida is true based on the provided data.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is TRUE.

Scanning through, I find a few instances where the score is 211:\n\n- In 1985: John Fiedler has a score of 211.\n- In 1987: Darrell Kestner's score is listed as \"210 po.\" The \"po\" might stand for something else, but I'm focusing on the numerical value here, which is 210, not 211. So that doesn't count.\n- Then in 1985, John Fiedler has 211 again.\n\nWait, are there any other scores of 211? Let me check from top to bottom again. \n\nLooking at row indices:\n\nRow 24: 1989 - Mike West with a score of 210.\nRow 25: 1988 - Webb Heintzelman with 205.\nRow 26: 1987 - Darrell Kestner, score 210 po. So no, that's 210.\nRow 27: 1986 - Robert Thompson has a score of 209.\nRow 28: 1985 - John Fiedler, score 211.\nRow 29: 1984 - Fred Funk with 206.\n\nWait, did I miss Mike West? Let me check again. \n\nMike West is in row 24 (year 1989) with a score of 210. Robert Thompson is in row 27 (year 1986) with a score of 209. So neither of them has a score of 211.\n\nWait, but the claim says Robert Thompson and Mike West both have 211 as their highest scores. But according to the table, Robert Thompson's highest is 209 in 1986, and Mike West's highest is 210 in 1989. So neither of them has a score of 211.\n\nThe only person with a score of 211 is John Fiedler in 1985 (row 28). But he doesn't tie with anyone because no one else has that exact score. \n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect. There's no tie at 211 between Robert Thompson and Mike West. Instead, John Fiedler holds the highest score of 211 alone.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"bruce zabriski score 284 at thorny lea golf club\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through each part of the claim step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions Bruce Zabriski and his score of 284. So I should look for any row in the table where the champion is Bruce Zabriski. Scanning through the rows, I see that in row 16 (which corresponds to year 1984), the champion is listed as Fred Funk at thorny lea golf club with a score of 206. Moving further down, I don't find any entry for Bruce Zabriski. So it seems he isn't listed in this table.\n\nNext, the claim says the score was 284. Looking through all the scores, I see various numbers like 205, 210, 209, etc., but 284 doesn't appear anywhere in the table. The highest score I notice is 214 for Victor Tortorici in 1983 at thorny lea golf club.\n\nThe venue mentioned is thorny lea golf club. From the table, it looks like this venue was used from 1980 to 1989 and again earlier years, but all the champions there have much lower scores than 284. The highest score at that location is around 214.\n\nSince Bruce Zabriski isn't listed in any row as a champion, and there's no score of 284 associated with thorny lea golf club, the claim doesn't hold up against the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Bruce Zabriski scored 284 at thorny lea golf club. Checking each part:\n\n- Champion \"Bruce Zabriski\": Not found in any row.\n- Score \"284\": No such score exists in the table.\n- Venue \"thorny lea golf club\" is present, but with much lower scores.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim \"the lowest championship score be 206 by fred funk in 1984\" is true based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Fred Funk achieved the lowest championship score of 206 in the year 1984. So, my task is to check if there's a row in the table where Fred Funk won with that specific score and year.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year with details about the champion, venue, location, and their score. I'll need to scan through these rows to find any mentions of Fred Funk.\n\nI start from the top of the table and go downwards. The first few rows are from 1984 onwards, but looking at each entry:\n\n- Row 30 is for 1984: Champion is Fred Funk, venue is Thorny Lea Golf Club in Brockton, Massachusetts, with a score of 206. \n\nWait, that's exactly what the claim says. But I should check if this is indeed the lowest score across all years.\n\nGoing through other rows:\n\n- In 1983 (Row 31), Victor Tortorici scored 214.\n- 1985: John Fiedler with 211\n- 1986: Robert Thompson with 209\n- 1987: Darrell Kestner with 210\n- 1988: Webb Heintzelman with 205\n- 1989: Mike West with 210\n- 1990: Steve Gotsche with 205\n- Continuing down to earlier years like 1977 (Row 36): Mike Zack scored 209\n\nWait, in Row 34 for 1980, John Jackson has a score of 205. That's lower than 206. So, if 205 is present, then the claim that 206 is the lowest can't be correct.\n\nTherefore, Fred Funk did have a score of 206 in 1984 (Row 30), but there are other scores like 205 which are lower. So the claim's assertion that 206 was the lowest isn't accurate because there are lower scores recorded.\n\nHence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Fred Funk achieved a score of 206 in 1984, which is correct (Row 30). However, this isn't the lowest score as other entries show lower scores like 205. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"there be 3 championship score at Brockton, Massachusetts in 1991-1994.\" So I need to verify if there were three championships held in Brockton during those years.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table provided. Each row represents a year with details about the champion, venue, location, and score. My focus is on rows where the location is \"Brockton, Massachusetts\" and the year falls between 1991 and 1994.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row for the location. Looking at the table:\n\n- Rows 24 to 37 are about events in Brockton, Massachusetts.\n- Specifically, I need to check years 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994.\n\nChecking each relevant year:\n\n- **1991**: Row 24 shows Kim Thompson as the champion. This counts as one championship.\n- **1992**: Row 25 has Steve Gotsche as the champion. That's the second.\n- **1993**: Row 26 lists Bill Loeffler as the champion. Now that's three.\n\nLooking at 1994: I check row 27, but it's about 1986, so maybe I missed something. Wait, actually, rows go from 1977 to 1990 in the provided data? Hmm, perhaps there was a typo or misindexing because according to the table given, the entries after 1994 don't exist. Wait, let me recount.\n\nWait, looking back: Rows 24 is 1990, row 25 is 1989, and so on. This seems inverted. Oh no, perhaps I got the rows wrong. Let me re-examine the table structure.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it appears that the rows are listed from year 1977 up to 1994. So row 24 is 1990, then each subsequent row decreases by a year until row 36 which is 1978. Wait, that doesn't make sense because row numbers increase as years decrease. That's confusing.\n\nWait no, actually, looking at the data again:\n\n- Row 24: 1990\n- Row 25: 1989\n- Row 26: 1988\n...\nSo to find 1991, I need to go higher in row numbers beyond what's given here. But the table provided only goes up to row 37, which is 1977.\n\nWait a second, maybe there was an error in how the rows are listed. Let me check again:\n\nThe user-provided table includes rows from year 1984 down to 1977 (rows 35-37). So perhaps the years after 1990 aren't present? Or did I miscount?\n\nWait, looking back at the original table, row indices go from 0 to 36 (assuming 37 rows total). Let me recount:\n\nRows 24: 1990\nRow 25: 1989\n...\nSo perhaps the years after 1990 aren't included. Wait no, because earlier in the table, rows 0-23 are from 1977 to 1994? Or is it that the table starts from 1977 and goes up? I'm getting confused.\n\nWait no, perhaps the table includes all years from 1977 to 1994, but when presented here, they're listed in reverse order. Let me check:\n\nLooking at row numbers:\n\n- Row 0: 1983 (Victor Tortorici)\n- Wait, this is getting messy because I think the table was pasted incorrectly.\n\nWait no, actually, looking again, the rows are ordered from year 1977 up to 1994. Let me check:\n\nRow 24: 1990\nRow 25: 1989\n...\nSo if I'm correct, row numbers increase as years decrease after a certain point. That's confusing.\n\nWait no, perhaps the table is ordered correctly with each subsequent row being an earlier year? Because looking at the data:\n\n- Row 0: 1983\n- Row 1: 1982\n...\nNo, that can't be right because then it would go backward. Maybe I misread.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is ordered from oldest to newest. Let me see:\n\nThe first rows (rows 0-23) are about events at different venues, including Brockton starting around row 24 (1990). So rows 24-36 are for years 1990 down to 1978.\n\nSo in this case, the years from 1991-1994 aren't present because the table stops at 1990. That would mean there's no data for 1991-1994 in Brockton, making it impossible to confirm three championships there during that period.\n\nWait, but according to the initial data provided by the user, rows go from 1977 up, but perhaps I'm miscounting. Alternatively, maybe the years after 1990 aren't included because they're not in the table. So if the table only goes up to 1990, we can't verify championships beyond that.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps it's safer to conclude based on the provided data that there are three championships in Brockton from 1991-1994 as per rows 24 (1990), but wait, no\u2014rows 24 is 1990. So if the table doesn't include 1991-1994, then we can't confirm three championships there.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread earlier. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at row numbers:\n\nRow 24: 1990\nRow 25: 1989\nRow 26: 1988\n...\nSo if the table only goes up to 1990, then years 1991-1994 aren't covered. Therefore, we can't find three championships in Brockton during that period because those rows don't exist.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought row 24 was 1990 and rows before that were later years. Maybe the table is ordered from newer to older years. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n\nRow 0: 1983\nRow 1: 1982\n...\nSo it seems like the table starts with later years (like 1983) and goes back to earlier ones. Therefore, the years 1991-1994 might not be present in the table at all.\n\nIn that case, since there's no data for those years, we can't confirm three championships in Brockton during 1991-1994 because they aren't listed.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me try to find rows where location is Brockton and year between 1991-1994.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 24: 1990\nNo rows for 1991, 1992, 1993, or 1994. So there are no entries for those years in Brockton.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided data, we can't confirm three championships there during that period because they aren't listed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there were three championships in Brockton, Massachusetts between 1991 and 1994. Upon examining the table:\n\n- The entries for years 1991-1994 are not present; only up to 1990 is included.\n\nThus, based on the provided data, we cannot confirm three championships in Brockton during that period.\n\n**Answer:** No, there isn't enough information as the relevant years aren't listed.",
