    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"when new york be the opponent, the score be 111 - 106\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It states that when the opponent is New York, the game's score was 111-106.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, opponent, score, location, and record. The columns are: game number, date, opponent, score, location/attendance, and record.\n\nI need to find all rows where the opponent is \"new york\". Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Opponent is San Francisco\n- Row 2: Boston\n- Row 3: Baltimore\n- Row 4: San Diego\n- Row 5: San Francisco\n- Row 6: San Francisco\n- Row 7: Seattle\n- Row 8: Philadelphia\n- Row 9: Cincinnati\n- Row 10: Milwaukee\n- Row 11: New York \u2192 This is the row we're interested in.\n- Row 12: Detroit\n- Row 13: Chicago\n- Row 14: Baltimore\n- Row 15: Baltimore\n- Row 16: Cincinnati\n- Row 17: Cincinnati\n\nSo, only Row 11 has \"new york\" as the opponent. Now I'll check the score for that game.\n\nIn Row 11, the score is listed as 111 - 106, which matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nTherefore, since there's a row where the opponent is New York and the score is indeed 111-106, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cell for this check is Row 11 under \"opponent\" and \"score\". However, according to the instructions, I should include each column checked as separate objects. So, I'll list both the opponent and score columns from Row 11.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"Alexander Memorial Coliseum be the location of the game with a score of 113 - 106.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row in the table to find the game where the score was 113-106. Then, check if that particular game's location is Alexander Memorial Coliseum.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Score is 109-105. Not matching.\nRow 2: Score is 103-123. No.\nRow 3: 119-140. Nope.\nRow 4: 114-101. Still not.\nRow 5: Here's a score of 113-106. Okay, so this is the game we're interested in.\n\nNow, check the location for row 5. The \"location / attendance\" column says Alexander Memorial Coliseum. So yes, that matches the claim.\n\nI should also make sure there are no other games with the same score elsewhere to avoid any confusion, but looking through the rest:\n\nRow 6: Score is 108-123.\nRow 7: 142-113 (but wait, this is a different order; the score here is 142 for our team and 113 against. The claim was 113-106, so not relevant).\nThe rest of the rows don't have that exact score.\n\nSo, only row 5 has the score 113-106 and it's at Alexander Memorial Coliseum.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"New York be the opponent at the game with a score of 112 - 106.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what this means. The claim has two parts that need to be verified:\n1. The opponent in a particular game is New York.\n2. The score of that game is 112-106.\n\nI'll start by looking through each row of the table to see where the opponent is New York and check if the score matches 112-106.\n\nLooking at the table, I can scan the \"opponent\" column for any mention of New York. Scanning rows 1 through 17, I notice that in row 8 (which corresponds to game number 18), the opponent is listed as New York. \n\nNow, checking the score for that game: it's listed as 111 - 106. The claim states a score of 112-106. Hmm, that's very close but not exactly the same. There's a difference in the first number\u2014111 versus 112.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake? Let me double-check row 8. Yes, opponent is New York, and the score is indeed 111-106. So that doesn't match the claim which says 112-106.\n\nIs there any other row where the opponent is New York? Looking through all rows again, it seems that's the only occurrence of New York as an opponent in this table.\n\nSo, since the score for the game against New York is 111-106, not 112-106, the claim isn't fully supported by the data. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't miss any other rows, let me quickly go through each row again. Rows 1: San Francisco, 2: Boston, 3: Baltimore, 4: San Diego, 5: San Francisco, 6: San Francisco, 7: Seattle, 8: Philadelphia, wait no\u2014that's opponent Philadephia in row 8? Wait, no\u2014row 8 is game 15, opponent Philadelphia. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me clarify the rows properly because I might have miscounted earlier. Let me list out the opponents for each row to ensure accuracy:\n\nRow 1: San Francisco\nRow 2: Boston\nRow 3: Baltimore\nRow 4: San Diego\nRow 5: San Francisco\nRow 6: San Francisco\nRow 7: Seattle\nRow 8: Philadelphia\nRow 9: Cincinnati\nRow 10: Milwaukee\nRow 11: New York (this is game 18, row index 10 if starting from 0)\nWait, no. The table provided has rows listed as Row 1 to Row 17, each with a game number. So in the naturalized format given, Row 1 corresponds to Game 8, up to Row 17 which is Game 24.\n\nSo when I thought of row 8 earlier, that was actually Game 15 (row index 7 if starting from 0). Then where is New York as an opponent? Looking again:\n\nRow 1: San Francisco\nRow 2: Boston\nRow 3: Baltimore\nRow 4: San Diego\nRow 5: San Francisco\nRow 6: San Francisco\nRow 7: Seattle\nRow 8: Philadelphia\nRow 9: Cincinnati\nRow 10: Milwaukee\nRow 11: New York (this is row index 10 in the list, which is Game 18)\nSo opponent New York is in Row 12 of the table as provided (since it's listed as Row 11 in the user message). Wait no\u2014the initial problem lists the rows as Row 1 to Row 17. So row index starts at 0.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing row numbering. Let me list all opponents:\n\nRow Index | Opponent\n0        | San Francisco (Game 8)\n1        | Boston (Game9)\n2        | Baltimore (Game10)\n3        | San Diego (Game11)\n4        | San Francisco (Game12)\n5        | San Francisco (Game13)\n6        | Seattle (Game14)\n7        | Philadelphia (Game15)\n8        | Cincinnati (Game16)\n9        | Milwaukee (Game17)\n10       | New York (Game18)\n11       | ... \n\nSo in row index 10, opponent is New York. Now, the score for that game is 111-106.\n\nThe claim is looking for a score of 112-106 against New York. Since it's 111 instead of 112, this doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because although there was a game against New York with a score close to what's claimed, the exact score doesn't match.\n</think>\n\nThe opponent New York appears in row index 10 with a score of 111-106, not 112-106. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"alexander memorial coliseum be the location of the game with a score of 114 - 106\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim and identify two main pieces of information: the location (Alexander Memorial Coliseum) and the specific score (114-106). My task is to check if there's a game in the table that matches both these details.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row of the table to find any occurrence where the location is Alexander Memorial Coliseum. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Location is Alexander Memorial Coliseum, score is 109-105.\nRow 2: Same location, score 103-123.\nRow 3: Different location (Baltimore Civic Center), so skip.\nRow 4: Back to Alexander, score 114-101. Hmm, that's close but not exactly 114-106.\nRow 5: Location is Alexander again, score 113-106. Wait, the home team scored 113 here, so it doesn't match 114-106.\nRow 6: Different location (Oakland), skip.\nRow 7: Away game in Seattle, skip.\nRow 8: Back to Alexander, score 115-116. Close but not matching.\nRow 9: In Cincinnati, so no.\nRow 10: Milwaukee, not relevant.\nRow 11: Location is Alexander, score 111-106. The home team scored 111, which isn't 114.\nRow 12: Detroit, location Cobos Arena, skip.\nRow 13: Chicago Stadium, nope.\nRow 14: Back to Alexander, score 111-118. Doesn't match.\nRow 15: Baltimore again, so skip.\nRow 16: Cincinnati, not relevant.\nRow 17: Cincinnatti Gardens, different location.\n\nWait a minute, I might have missed something earlier. Let me double-check Row 4 and Row 5 more carefully. \n\nIn Row 4, the score is 114-101. The home team scored 114 here, but the claim mentions 114-106. So that's different.\n\nLooking again at Row 5: Score is 113-106. Home team has 113, away has 106. Not a match either.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error. Let me check all rows where the location is Alexander Memorial Coliseum:\n\nRows 1,2,4,5,8,11,14,16.\n\nLooking at each of these for a score of 114-106:\n\nRow 1: 109-105\nRow 2: 103-123\nRow 4: 114-101\nRow 5: 113-106\nRow 8: 115-116\nRow 11: 111-106\nRow 14: 111-118\nRow 16: 94-91\n\nNone of these have a score exactly matching 114-106. The closest is Row 5 with 113-106, but that's not the same.\n\nTherefore, there's no game at Alexander Memorial Coliseum with a score of 114-106. So the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_ cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
