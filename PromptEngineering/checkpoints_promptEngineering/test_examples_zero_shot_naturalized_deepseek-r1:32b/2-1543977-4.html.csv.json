    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"santiago luna miguel angel martin be the runner up behind tiger wood in 1999.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim is referring to. The claim mentions two people, Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin, as runners-up in a competition where Tiger Woods was the winner. This event supposedly took place in the year 1999.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll go through each row to find the relevant information.\n\nStarting with Row 1: It's from the year 1999. The country is the United States, and the team consists of Mark O'Meara & Tiger Woods. However, the individual listed is Tiger Woods himself. The location is Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. Now, looking at the runners-up for that year, it says Santiago Luna & Miguel Angel Martin.\n\nWait a second\u2014that's exactly what the claim states! So according to Row 1 of the table, both Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin were the runners-up behind Tiger Woods in 1999. This matches the claim perfectly.\n\nI should double-check if there are any other rows that might have information about these individuals or the year 1999. Scanning through Rows 2 to 7, I see that they cover years from 1998 down to 1993 and involve different countries and teams. None of them mention Santiago Luna or Miguel Angel Martin except Row 1.\n\nTherefore, based on the information in Row 1, the claim is accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin were runners-up behind Tiger Woods in 1999. Checking the table, Row 1 confirms this as Tiger Woods was the individual and the runners-up are listed as Santiago Luna & Miguel Angel Martin.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"runners - up\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim \"the tournament be first hold in cape town in 1996\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that the tournament was held for the first time in Cape Town in the year 1996.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year from 1993 to 1999. Each row has details about the country, team, individual winner, location, and runners-up.\n\nI should check if there's any record of a tournament held in Cape Town before 1996 because the claim says it was \"first\" held there in 1996. So I need to verify two things: whether Cape Town is indeed the location for that year, and if no earlier entries have Cape Town as the location.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Row 7 (1993): Location is Orlando, Florida, USA.\n- Row 6 (1994): Location is Dorado, Puerto Rico.\n- Row 5 (1995): Shenzhen, China.\n- Row 4 (1996): Cape Town, South Africa. This matches the claim's location and year.\n- Rows 3,2,1: Their locations are Kiawah Island, Auckland, and Kuala Lumpur respectively.\n\nSo, looking at row 4, it indeed has the location as Cape Town in 1996. There are no earlier entries (from 1993 to 1995) where Cape Town is listed as a location. Therefore, this would mean that 1996 was the first time the tournament was held there.\n\nHowever, I should double-check for any other mentions of Cape Town in the table. Scanning through all rows again, only row 4 has Cape Town mentioned. So yes, it's correct that the first holding in Cape Town was in 1996.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"tiger wood have only win 1 year\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that Tiger Woods has won only one year. From the context of sports, especially golf, I know that Tiger Woods has had a very successful career with multiple wins, but maybe this table is about a specific event or competition. So I should focus on the data provided here.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year from 1993 to 1999. Each row has details like country, team members, individual winner, location, and runners-up. The claim is about Tiger Woods, so I need to look for his name in the relevant columns across all rows.\n\nThe relevant columns for determining wins would be \"individual\" since that's likely indicating the champion of that year. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Year 1999\n- Individual: Tiger Woods. So he won in 1999.\n\nRow 2: Year 1998\n- Individual: Scott Verplank. Not Tiger.\n\nRow 3: Year 1997\n- Individual: Colin Montgomerie. Not Tiger.\n\nRow 4: Year 1996\n- Individual: Ernie Els. Not Tiger.\n\nRow 5: Year 1995\n- Individual: Davis Love III. Not Tiger.\n\nRow 6: Year 1994\n- Individual: Fred Couples. Not Tiger.\n\nRow 7: Year 1993\n- Individual: Bernhard Langer. Not Tiger.\n\nSo from the table, Tiger Woods only appears as the individual winner in Row 1 (1999). That's just one year. \n\nWait a minute, but I recall that Tiger Woods has won multiple tournaments and majors, so maybe this table is about a specific event or perhaps it's incomplete? But since the claim is based on this table, I have to go by what's presented here.\n\nThe claim says he only won once according to the data. Since in the table, he's listed as the individual winner in 1999 and nowhere else, that supports the claim as TRUE. So I think the answer should be TRUE, with the relevant cell being Row 1, \"individual\".\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"individual\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"tiger wood have win several year\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It seems like it's claiming that Tiger Woods has won multiple times over several years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year from 1993 to 1999. The relevant columns for this claim would be the \"individual\" and \"year\" columns because we're checking how many times Tiger Woods appears as an individual winner across different years.\n\nStarting with Row 1 (1999), the individual is Tiger Woods. So that's one win for him in 1999.\n\nChecking Row 2 (1998), the individual is Scott Verplank, not Tiger Woods.\n\nRow 3 (1997) has Colin Montgomerie as the individual winner.\n\nRow 4 (1996) lists Ernie Els as the individual.\n\nRow 5 (1995): Davis Love III is the individual winner.\n\nRow 6 (1994) shows Fred Couples winning.\n\nFinally, Row 7 (1993) has Bernhard Langer as the individual.\n\nFrom this, Tiger Woods only appears once in the \"individual\" column for the year 1999. Since he only won once according to the table, the claim that he has won several years isn't supported here. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows Tiger Woods as an individual winner only once in 1999. Hence, the claim is not supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"individual\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim \"santiago luna miguel angel martin be the runner up behind tiger wood in 1997\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim accurately. It mentions Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin as runners-up behind Tiger Woods in the year 1997. So, my main points of verification are:\n\n1. The year should be 1997.\n2. Tiger Woods must have been the individual winner that year.\n3. Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin were the runners-up.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find relevant information.\n\nStarting with Row 1 (Year: 1999), it doesn't match our target year of 1997, so I can skip this.\n\nRow 2 is for 1998. Again, not matching 1997, so moving on.\n\nNow, Row 3 corresponds to the year 1997. Let's look at the details here:\n\n- Country: Ireland\n- Team: P\u00e3\u00a1draig Harrington & Paul McGinley\n- Individual: Colin Montgomerie\n- Location: Kiawah Island, South Carolina, USA\n- Runners-up: Colin Montgomerie & Raymond Russell\n\nWait a minute. The individual listed here is Colin Montgomerie, not Tiger Woods. So, according to this row, the winner in 1997 was Colin Montgomerie from Ireland, and the runners-up were also Colin Montgomerie (possibly a typo or duplication) and Raymond Russell.\n\nThis contradicts the claim that Tiger Woods was the winner in 1997 because, in Row 3, the individual is Colin Montgomerie. Therefore, Tiger Woods isn't listed as the winner for that year in this table.\n\nLooking further down to ensure there's no other row for 1997, Rows 4 through 7 are from 1996 downwards and don't include 1997 again. So, Row 3 is the only entry for 1997.\n\nThe runners-up in 1997, according to this table, were Colin Montgomerie and Raymond Russell. The claim mentions Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin as runners-up, which doesn't match what's in the table.\n\nMoreover, Tiger Woods is mentioned in Row 1 for 1999 as the individual winner with Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin as runners-up. That was two years after the claimed year.\n\nPutting it all together: The claim states that in 1997, Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin were runners-up behind Tiger Woods. However, according to the table:\n\n- In 1997 (Row 3), the individual winner was Colin Montgomerie.\n- The runners-up were Colin Montgomerie and Raymond Russell.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it misidentifies both the winner and the runners-up for that year. Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin were not runners-up in 1997; they were in 1999 with Tiger Woods as the winner.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin were runners-up behind Tiger Woods in 1997. Checking the table:\n\n- In Row 3 (Year: 1997), the individual is Colin Montgomerie, not Tiger Woods.\n- Runners-up are Colin Montgomerie & Raymond Russell, not Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"individual\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"runners - up\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim has two main parts: the location (Cape Town) and the year (1998). I need to check both of these against the table.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- Row 2 is for the year 1998. The country is England, team members are David Carter & Nick Faldo, individual is Scott Verplank, location is Auckland, New Zealand, and runners-up are Massimo Florioli & Costantino Rocca.\n\nWait a minute, so in 1998, the tournament was held in Auckland, not Cape Town. That contradicts part of the claim already.\n\nNow, checking when Cape Town was the location. Let's look through each row:\n\n- Row 4 is for 1996. The country is South Africa, and the location is Cape Town, South Africa.\n\nSo, according to the table, Cape Town hosted the tournament in 1996, not 1998. Therefore, the first time it was held there would be 1996, not 1998 as the claim states.\n\nTherefore, both aspects of the claim are incorrect: the location for 1998 isn't Cape Town, and Cape Town's first hosting was in 1996.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because in 1998, the tournament was held in Auckland, not Cape Town. Additionally, Cape Town hosted it in 1996, making that its first occurrence.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
