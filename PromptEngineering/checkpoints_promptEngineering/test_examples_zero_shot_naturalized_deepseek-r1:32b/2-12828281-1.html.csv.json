The claim says: \"the game play on december 6, 1964 be during week 13.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim. The key pieces are the date (December 6, 1964) and the week number (week 13). I need to check if there's a row in the table that matches both these criteria.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nRow 1: Week 1, Date September 13\nRow 2: Week 2, Date September 19\nRow 3: Week 3, Date September 27\nRow 4: Week 4, October 3\nRow 5: Week 5, October 10\nRow 6: Week 6, October 16\nRow 7: Week 7, October 25\nRow 8: Week 8, November 1\nRow 9: Week 9, November 8\nRow 10: Week 10, November 15\nRow 11: Week 11, November 22\nRow 12: Week 12, November 29\nRow 13: Week 13, December 6\nRow 14: Week 14, December 20\n\nSo, looking at Row 13: the week is 13 and the date is December 6, 1964. That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there's a row where both the week and date match the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the game play on december 6 , 1964 be after week 13\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that the game played on December 6, 1964, was scheduled to take place after week 13. So I need to check two things: when did the game happen in terms of weeks, and whether it occurred after week 13.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like week number, date, opponent, result, and attendance. The claim is about the game on December 6, 1964. Let me find that specific row.\n\nScrolling through the rows:\n\nRow 1: September 13, Week 1\n...\nRow 7: October 25, Week 7\nRow 8: November 1, Week 8\nRow 9: November 8, Week 9\nRow 10: November 15, Week 10\nRow 11: November 22, Week 11\nRow 12: November 29, Week 12\nRow 13: December 6, Week 13\nRow 14: December 20, Week 14\n\nAh, there's a game on December 6, 1964 in Row 13. The week number for that row is 13. So the game was played during week 13.\n\nThe claim says it was after week 13. But according to the table, this game was exactly in week 13. Therefore, it wasn't after week 13; it was on week 13. \n\nSo the claim is incorrect because the game was played during week 13, not after.\n\nTo confirm, I'll check if there are any games scheduled after week 14. The last row is week 14, so no further weeks beyond that in the table. Hence, December 6 is exactly week 13.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the game on December 6, 1964, was after week 13. However, according to the table, this game occurred during week 13. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Step-by-step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Claim:** The game on December 6, 1964, was played after week 13.\n2. **Locate Relevant Data in Table:** Look for the row with date December 6, 1964.\n3. **Check Week Number:** That row is Row 13, which corresponds to week 13.\n4. **Evaluate Claim:** Since the game was during week 13, not after it, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the game play on december 2 , 1963 be week 15",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine if a given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim in question is: \"the game play on december 2, 1963 be week 15.\" I need to check this against the provided table and decide based on the data.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the table contains. It's a list of games played over several weeks in 1964. Each row has details like the week number, date, opponent team, result (with scores), and attendance. The claim mentions a game on December 2, 1963, which is in 1963, but all the dates in the table are from September to December 1964. That already seems off because 1963 doesn't appear here.\n\nLooking at the weeks: the table has rows from week 1 to week 14. The claim refers to week 15, which isn't present in the table at all. So, if there's no data for week 15 or December 2, 1963, it's unlikely that the claim is true.\n\nWait a second\u2014the date in the claim is December 2, 1963, but the latest date in the table is December 20, 1964. That means all entries are from 1964, not 1963. So, there's no game on December 2, 1963, listed here.\n\nAdditionally, looking at week numbers, the last week is 14 in the table, so week 15 isn't covered either. Therefore, both the date and the week number mentioned in the claim don't exist in the provided data.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The claim specifies a date that's not present (December 2, 1963) and refers to a week number (week 15) beyond what's in the table. Therefore, there's no support for this claim in the given table. It must be FALSE.\n\nNow, regarding relevant cells: Since the claim mentions December 2, 1963, I should check all rows for that date. All dates are in 1964, so none match. Also, since week 15 isn't listed, there's no row with that week number. So, there are no relevant cells to support the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a game on December 2, 1963, which is not present in the table as all entries are from 1964. Additionally, week 15 isn't listed in the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
