    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"neil labute be nominate for best play in 2009\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its key components:\n- Person: Neil Labute\n- Action: Be nominated (nominate)\n- Category: Best Play\n- Year: 2009\n\nNow, looking at the table, there are seven rows of data from 2009 award ceremonies. The relevant columns are year, award ceremony, category, nominee, and result.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if any match all these criteria:\n1. Row 1: Year is 2009, award is Tony Award, category is Best Play, nominee is Neil Labute, result is nominated.\n   - This matches exactly with the claim.\n2. Rows 2-7 don't have Neil Labute as a nominee or in the Best Play category.\n\nSo, Row 1 is the only relevant cell that confirms the nomination of Neil Labute for Best Play in 2009.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cell is row_index 0 (since rows are zero-indexed) with column_name 'nominee'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 0,\n       \"column_name\": \"nominee\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "thomas sadoski be nominate for best performance by a lead actor in a play in 2009",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"thomas sadoski be nominate for best performance by a lead actor in a play in 2009\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully understanding each part of the claim.\n\nFirst, the name mentioned is Thomas Sadoski. The action here is that he was nominated. The category is \"best performance by a lead actor in a play,\" and the year is 2009.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll go through each row to see if there's any information about Thomas Sadoski from 2009 in the relevant categories.\n\nRow 1: It's about Neil LaBute nominated for Best Play at the Tony Awards. Doesn't mention Thomas Sadoski.\nRow 2: This one says \"best performance by a leading actor in a play\" with nominee Thomas Sadoski, result is nominated. The award ceremony is the Tony Award and the year is 2009. So this seems to match part of the claim.\n\nWait, but let me check other rows too to make sure there's no conflicting information or additional relevant data.\n\nRow 3: Marin Ireland for a featured actress at Tony Awards.\nRow 4: Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play.\nRow 5: Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Play, nominee is Thomas Sadoski, result is nominated. So here he was also nominated at another ceremony, but the claim specifically mentions \"best performance by a lead actor,\" which could be similar to \"Outstanding Actor in a Play.\"\n\nWait, but the claim says \"Tony Award\" or does it? Let me recheck the claim: It just says \"nominated for best performance...\" without specifying the award. So both Tony and Drama Desk have nominations.\n\nBut the key here is whether he was nominated in 2009 for that specific category. From row 2, yes, at the Tony Awards, he was nominated for Best Leading Actor in a play, which matches the claim's description. The result is \"nominated,\" so that supports it being TRUE.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows mentioning Thomas Sadoski to ensure consistency. Row 5 mentions him again but under Drama Desk, which isn't part of this claim since the claim doesn't specify the award ceremony beyond the year and category.\n\nSo putting it all together: The claim is that in 2009, Thomas Sadoski was nominated for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play. Looking at row 2, that's exactly what happened\u2014he was nominated. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells are row 2 with columns year, award ceremony, category, nominee, and result to confirm all parts of the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by row 2 in the table where Thomas Sadoski was nominated for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play at the Tony Awards in 2009.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"award ceremony\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"reason to be pretty be nominate for best play more than 1 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It seems a bit unclear due to possible typos or grammatical issues. The phrase \"reason to be pretty be nominate\" might mean that \"Reason to Be Pretty\" was nominated for an award. Specifically, it mentions being nominated more than once in the category of best play.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a nomination with details like year, award ceremony, category, nominee, and result. The relevant information here would be any entries where the award is \"best play.\" \n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Year 2009, Tony Award for Best Play, Nominee Neil LaBute. Result is \"nominated.\"\n- Rows 2-3 are other categories in the Tony Awards, so they don't apply.\n- Rows 4-6 pertain to Drama Desk Awards and Theatre World Award but not specifically about Best Play.\n- Row 7: Theatre World Award won by Marin Ireland, which isn't a best play category.\n\nSo, only Row 1 is relevant. It shows one nomination for \"Reason to Be Pretty\" in the Best Play category at the Tony Awards. Since there's only one entry for this award and category, it wasn't nominated more than once as per the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's only one nomination recorded.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"Reason to Be Pretty\" was nominated for Best Play more than once in 2009. Checking the table, we find only one nomination under the Tony Award for Best Play. Thus, the claim is not supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"award ceremony\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"category\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"before 2009 be the only year that reason to be pretty have a nominee at the drama desk award ceremony.\" Hmm, this phrasing is a bit confusing, but I think it's trying to say that before 2009, there was only one year where \"reason to be pretty\" had a nominee at the Drama Desk Award ceremony. \n\nWait, looking back, in the table provided, all entries are for the year 2009. So if someone is claiming that before 2009, there was only one year with a nominee, but our data starts from 2009 and doesn't have any earlier years, how can we confirm or deny that? \n\nLet me break down the claim step by step. The key points are:\n1. Before 2009: So looking at years prior to 2009.\n2. Only one year where \"reason to be pretty\" had a nominee.\n3. At the Drama Desk Award ceremony.\n\nBut in our table, all entries are for the year 2009. There's no information about any years before that. Therefore, we don't have data on whether there were nominees from \"reason to be pretty\" in previous years. Without that data, we can't verify if 2009 was indeed the only year or not.\n\nLooking at the relevant cells, I see rows 4 and 5 are related to Drama Desk Awards in 2009. So these would be the cells checked for nominees in 2009, but since they don't provide information about prior years, we can't confirm the claim's assertion about before 2009.\n\nSo because there's no data on years before 2009 in the table, the claim isn't supported. Therefore, it should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table only contains data from 2009 and doesn't provide information about prior years for Drama Desk Award nominees related to \"reason to be pretty.\" Thus, we cannot confirm the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"award ceremony\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"award ceremony\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
