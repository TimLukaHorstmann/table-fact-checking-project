    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"erica montolfo - bura write an episode which gain 1.81 million viewer.\"\n\nFirst, I should parse the claim. It's saying that Erica Montolfo-Bura wrote an episode that had 1.81 million viewers. To verify this, I need to look through each row of the table and check two things: who wrote the episode (the 'written by' column) and what the US viewers were in millions.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 2 has \"erica montolfo - bura\" as the writer and US viewers of 1.81 million.\n- I should note that row index might be zero-based, so Row 1 is index 0? Wait, actually, looking back at the table structure provided, it's listed from Row 1 to Row 17, but in programming terms, indices often start at 0. However, when referring to rows in a table like this, they are usually counted starting from 1. So Row 2 would be index 1 if considering zero-based indexing or just row number 2 if one-based.\n\nWait, the user didn't specify whether the row indexes are zero-based or not. In their example, they used \"row_index\": 0 for the first row, so I think it's safe to assume that rows are zero-indexed here. So Row 1 in the table is index 0, Row 2 is index 1, etc.\n\nSo checking each row:\n\nRow 1: Written by Mara Brock Akil, viewers 2.54M - doesn't match.\nRow 2 (index 1): Writer Erica Montolfo-Bura, viewers 1.81M - this matches the claim exactly.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cell is Row 2 (which would be row_index: 1) in both 'written by' and 'us viewers (million)' columns.\n\nWait, no\u2014the relevant cells are where the writer is Erica Montolfo-Bura and where the viewer count is 1.81. So for each condition:\n\n- The writer column must have \"erica montolfo - bura\".\n- The US viewers must be 1.81 million.\n\nSo I need to find a row where both conditions are met.\n\nLooking again, Row 2 (index 1) has 'written by' as Erica Montolfo-Bura and 'us viewers (million)' as 1.81. So this is the relevant row.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE because in that specific row, Erica wrote the episode, and it had exactly 1.81 million viewers.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by Row 2 where Erica Montolfo-Bura wrote an episode with 1.81M viewers.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"written by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (million)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the title of episode 102 in the series be we gotta stop meeting like this\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table structure. Each row represents an episode with several attributes: no in series, no in season, title, directed by, written by, original air date, and US viewers (million).\n\nThe claim refers to episode 102 in the series. So I should look for the row where \"no in series\" is 102.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 1: Series no 100-101\n- Row 2: Series no 102\n\nAh, here we go. The second row has \"no in series: 102\". Now I need to check the title of that episode. According to the claim, it's \"we gotta stop meeting like this\".\n\nChecking the title column for row 2: Yes, the title is indeed \"we gotta stop meeting like this\". So the claim matches the data.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE. The relevant cell is in row index 1 (since rows are zero-indexed) and the column name is \"title\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim \"kenny smith write number 11 in the season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like the claim is stating that Kenny Smith wrote episode number 11 in the season. So, I'm looking for an entry where the writer is Kenny Smith and the \"no in season\" column has a value of 11.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to check the relevant columns: \"written by\" and \"no in season\".\n\n- **Row 10**: This row mentions \"kenny smith\" as the writer. Let's see what the \"no in season\" is here. It says 11. So this seems to match the claim exactly.\n\nTo make sure I'm not missing anything, I'll scan through the other rows quickly:\n\n- Rows before Row 10 don't have a season number of 11.\n- Rows after Row 10 also don't show any other entries with Kenny Smith writing for season 11.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim is TRUE because Row 10 confirms that Kenny Smith wrote episode 11 in the season. The relevant cell here is \"written by\" in Row 10 and \"no in season\" which is 11 in the same row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table where Kenny Smith is listed as the writer for season number 11.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"written by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"eric laneuville direct episode 106 in the series\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions Eric Laneuville directing Episode 106 of the series. So, I should look for Episode 106 and check who directed it.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with various details. The first thing is to find which row corresponds to Episode 106. Scanning through the rows, Row 6 has \"no in series: 106\". That's the one I need.\n\nNow, looking into Row 6, let me check who directed it. The column for \"directed by\" says Mary Lou Belli. So, according to this row, Mary Lou Belli directed Episode 106.\n\nThe claim states that Eric Laneuville directed it, but the table shows a different director. Therefore, the claim is false because there's no match in the relevant cells.\n\nI should also note which cells are relevant for verification. The key cells here are \"directed by\" from Row 6 and \"no in series: 106\" from the same row to confirm we're looking at the correct episode.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Eric Laneuville did not direct Episode 106; Mary Lou Belli did.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"episode 102 air multiple time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim means. It says that episode number 102 aired multiple times. So, I should check if there's more than one entry for episode 102 in the table. If there is only one entry, then it's FALSE because it didn't air multiple times. If there are two or more entries, then it would be TRUE.\n\nLooking at the table structure provided, each row represents an episode with details like number in series, season, title, etc. The first row (Row 1) is actually a header, so the actual data starts from Row 2 onward, but wait, looking again, no, the user provided rows starting from Row 1 as data. Wait, let me check:\n\nThe table has rows starting from Row 1 to Row 17. Each row has details about an episode, including \"no in series,\" which I think refers to the overall series number.\n\nNow, focusing on the claim: Episode 102. So I need to find all occurrences where \"no in series\" is 102. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: no in series is 100-101. So this might be two episodes combined? Or maybe it's a typo and should be separate rows. But according to the given table, Row 1 covers series numbers 100 and 101 as one entry.\n- Row 2: no in series is 102. That's exactly what we're looking for.\n- Rows 3 through 17: Each has a unique \"no in series\" number from 103 up to 118, except that some are skipped and there might be a missing row (like Row 16 jumps from 115 to 117, but that's probably just the way it's presented).\n\nSo, looking at each row:\n\n- Only Row 2 has \"no in series\" as 102. All other rows have different numbers. Therefore, there is only one entry for episode 102.\n\nSince there's only one airing recorded for episode 102 in the table, the claim that it aired multiple times isn't supported by the data provided. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells. The claim is about episode 102's airing, so the relevant cell would be where \"no in series\" is 102. That's Row 2, specifically the column \"no in series.\"\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is FALSE, and the relevant cell is Row 2, Column \"no in series.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim that episode 102 aired multiple times is evaluated by checking the table for multiple entries of episode number 102. The table shows only one entry with \"no in series\" as 102.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"kenny smith write everything before season 11\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that Kenny Smith wrote everything (all episodes) before season 11. That means every episode with a season number less than 11 should have been written by Kenny Smith according to the claim.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with details like series number, season number, title, writer(s), etc. I need to check all rows where the \"no in season\" is less than 11 and see if their writer is Kenny Smith.\n\nLet's go through each relevant row:\n\n- Row 1: Season 1-2, written by Mara Brock Akil. Not Kenny Smith.\n- Row 2: Season 3, written by Erica Montolfo - Bura. Not Kenny Smith.\n- Row 3: Season 4, written by Marcos Luevanos. Not Kenny Smith.\n- Row 4: Season 5, written by Kenya Barris. Not Kenny Smith.\n- Row 5: Season 6, written by Hale Rothstein. Not Kenny Smith.\n- Row 6: Season 7, written by Hale Rothstein. Not Kenny Smith.\n- Row 7: Season 8, written by Jenifer Rice - Genzuk Henry. Not Kenny Smith.\n- Row 8: Season 9, written by Erica Montolfo - Bura. Not Kenny Smith.\n- Row 9: Season 10, written by Kenny Smith. Okay, this one is by him.\n\nSo from season 1 to 10, most episodes aren't written by Kenny Smith except for season 10 in row 9.
