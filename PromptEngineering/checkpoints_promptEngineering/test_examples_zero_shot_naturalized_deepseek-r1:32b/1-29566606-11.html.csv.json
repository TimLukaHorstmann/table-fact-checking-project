    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a table with some data about TV programmes and their broadcast details. The claim is \"art attack be originally broadcast on citv.\" My task is to determine if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the table represents. Let me look at the columns: programme, date(s) of original removal, original channel(s), date of return, and new channel(s). So for each programme, it's showing when it was removed from its original channel, when it returned, and possibly a change in channels.\n\nThe claim is about \"art attack\" and whether it was originally on CITV. I'll start by searching the table for \"art attack.\" Looking at Row 4: Programme is art attack. Under original channel(s), it says citv. So that directly answers the claim. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything else in the row. The date of original removal is 13 July 2007, and it returned on 6 June 2011 on Disney Junior. But since the claim is only about the original broadcast channel, that's all I need from this row.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information elsewhere in the table because each row pertains to a different programme. The other programmes like celebrity big brother and born to be different are on Channel 4, absolutely fabulous on BBC One, so they don't affect this particular claim.\n\nTherefore, since the original channel for art attack is CITV according to Row 4, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"art attack\" was originally broadcast on CITV. Checking the table, in Row 4 under the 'programme' column, it lists 'art attack'. The corresponding 'original channel(s)' are indeed CITV.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Programme:** Locate the row for \"art attack\" which is Row 4.\n2. **Check Original Channel:** In Row 4 under the 'original channel(s)' column, it's listed as CITV.\n3. **Confirm Claim Accuracy:** The claim matches the information in the table.\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"programme\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original channel(s)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"big brother will return on september 9, 2011\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by looking at each part of the claim and checking against the table.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"big brother.\" Looking through the rows, row 2 has the programme name as \"big brother.\" That's relevant. Now, the date mentioned in the claim is \"september 9, 2011.\" I'll check the \"date of return\" column for that row.\n\nIn row 2 under \"date of return,\" it says \"9 september 2011.\" The format here is day first, month, year. The claim uses month first, but regardless, the date matches exactly: September 9, 2011.\n\nSo the relevant cells are row 2's programme and date of return columns. Since both parts of the claim align with the table information, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in row 2 where the \"date of return\" for \"big brother\" is listed as 9 September 2011.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Programme:** The claim refers to \"big brother,\" which matches row 2 in the table.\n2. **Check Return Date:** The claim states the return date as September 9, 2011. Row 2's \"date of return\" is 9 september 2011, confirming the date.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"programme\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date of return\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Now, I'll check the \"date of return\" column for this row. The date listed there is 9 June 2011. \n\nThe claim states that it will return on August 18, 2011, but according to the table, the return date was June 9, 2011. Since these dates don't match, the claim is not supported by the data provided.\n\nSo, I'll mark this as FALSE and list the relevant cells which are row 5's \"date of return\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date of return\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
