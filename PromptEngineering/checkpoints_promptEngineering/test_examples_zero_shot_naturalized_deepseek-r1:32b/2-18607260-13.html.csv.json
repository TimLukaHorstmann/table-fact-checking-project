    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the world cup have 4 game throughout june 1998 , all of which be in france.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It mentions four World Cup games in June 1998, and all are supposed to be in France.\n\nLooking at the table, I should check each row that falls within June 1998 and see if it's a World Cup game, then count how many there are and their venues.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Date is 1998-02-08. That's February, so not in June.\nRow 2: 1998-03-14. March, so nope.\nRow 3: 1998-03-18. Also March.\nRow 4: 1998-03-28. Still March.\nRow 5: 1998-04-22. April.\nRow 6: 1998-05-17. May.\nRow 7: 1998-05-21. Also May.\nRow 8: 1998-06-01. June, but the competition is 'f', not World Cup.\nRow 9: 1998-06-03. Competition is 'f'.\nRow 10: 1998-06-06. Comp is 'f' again.\n\nNow, looking for June entries with comp as 'world cup'. Let's check rows 11 to 14:\n\nRow 11: Date is 1998-06-12, comp is world cup. Venue is France.\nRow 12: 1998-06-19, same comp and venue as row 11.\nRow 13: 1998-06-24, also World Cup in France.\nRow 14: 1998-06-28, World Cup again. But wait, the score mentions aet (after extra time), but that's just about the game result, not location.\n\nSo rows 11,12,13,14 are all in June 1998 and part of the World Cup, each located in France. That makes four games, which matches the claim.\n\nWait a second, though. Let me double-check the dates to ensure they're all in June. All these rows (11-14) have dates in June: 12th, 19th, 24th, and 28th. So that's four games, all in France as per their venues.\n\nThe claim says \"all of which be in france\" \u2013 looking at the venue column for these rows:\n\nRow11: stade de la mosson montpellier \u2013 France.\nRow12: stade geoffroy-guichard saint-\u00c9tienne \u2013 France.\nRow13: stade de toulouse \u2013 France.\nRow14: stade f\u00e9lix bollaert lens \u2013 France.\n\nSo yes, all four are in France. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as there are exactly four World Cup games in June 1998, each held in France.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"comp\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"comp\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"comp\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"comp\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"netherlands and romania have game on june 1 and june 3 , respectively , in 1998\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: it states that the Netherlands played a game on June 1, 1998, and Romania played a game on June 3, 1998. I need to check if these two events are correctly represented in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like date, venue, score, etc. The relevant columns for this claim are \"date\" and \"venue\", as they will help me identify which teams played on specific dates.\n\nLet's go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Date is February 8, 1998. This doesn't match either June 1 or June 3.\n2. **Row 2**: March 14, 1998. Still not relevant.\n3. **Row 3**: March 18, 1998. Not the dates we're looking for.\n4. **Row 4**: March 28, 1998. Nope.\n5. **Row 5**: April 22, 1998. Doesn't match.\n6. **Row 6**: May 17, 1998. Not relevant either.\n7. **Row 7**: May 21, 1998. Still not the target dates.\n8. **Row 8**: June 1, 1998. The venue is Philips Stadion Eindhoven in the Netherlands. So this row shows a game on June 1 in the Netherlands. But does it involve Romania? Let me check the score and report number to see if there's more info, but the table doesn't specify teams playing against each other. Hmm, maybe I need to consider that Philips Stadion is in the Netherlands, so perhaps this was a match involving the Dutch team.\n9. **Row 9**: June 3, 1998. Venue is Steaua Stadium Bucharest in Romania. So this game took place on June 3 in Romania. Again, without team names, but it's likely that Romania was involved here since it's their stadium.\n\nWait, the claim mentions both Netherlands and Romania having games on those specific dates. From rows 8 and 9, we can see games taking place on June 1 and June 3 in those countries respectively. However, I should verify if these were matches involving those national teams or just any teams playing at their stadiums.\n\nThe table doesn't specify the teams involved, only the venue country and the date. So assuming that the game on June 1 in the Netherlands was a match involving the Dutch team (Netherlands), and similarly, the game on June 3 in Romania was involving the Romanian team. \n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported: Netherlands had a game on June 1, and Romania had one on June 3.\n\nI need to mark this as TRUE and note the relevant rows 8 and 9 for their dates and venues.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the table shows games in the Netherlands on June 1 (Row 8) and Romania on June 3 (Row 9).\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"neither team scored in the first two games of the World Cup in France\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which rows in the table correspond to the World Cup matches in France. Looking at the 'comp' column, the World Cup matches are in rows 11, 12, 13, and 14 because their competition is listed as \"world cup\". The other rows have different competitions like 'f' or 'kirin cup', so I can ignore those.\n\nNow, focusing on the first two World Cup games. These would be the earliest dates in the World Cup section. Let's check the dates:\n\n- Row 11: June 12, 1998\n- Row 12: June 19, 1998\n\nSo, rows 11 and 12 are the first two games of the World Cup in France.\n\nNext, I look at the 'score' column for these two rows. \n\nRow 11's score is 0 - 0, meaning neither team scored.\nRow 12's score is also 0 - 0, so again, no goals were scored by either team.\n\nSince both of these matches had a score of 0-0, it means that in the first two games of the World Cup held in France, neither team scored any goals. Therefore, the claim seems to be supported.\n\nI should make sure there are no other World Cup rows before these dates that I might have missed. Scanning through the table again, all the 'world cup' entries start at row 11 and go on from there. There's nothing earlier than June 12 in the World Cup section.\n\nSo, the relevant cells to verify this claim are the scores of the first two World Cup games (rows 11 and 12) since they show both matches ended with no goals.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the first two World Cup matches in France on June 12 and June 19 both had a score of 0-0, meaning neither team scored.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim mentions June 1 and June 3, so I need to see if there are any games on those dates under the Kirin Cup competition.\n\nLooking at Row 6: It's from May 17, 1998, with the competition as \"kirin cup\". The date isn't in June, so this doesn't apply. Next is Row 7, also a Kirin Cup game on May 21, still not in June.\n\nNow checking the other rows to see if any are from June. Rows 1 through 5 have dates before June. Rows 8-14 are in June, but their competitions are listed as 'f' or 'world cup', not 'kirin cup'. For example, Row 8 is on June 1, but it's under 'f' competition, not Kirin Cup.\n\nSince there are no Kirin Cup games listed for June 1 or June 3 in the table, the claim isn't supported.

The claim mentions two specific dates: June 18 and June 28, 1998. It states that both games on these dates ended with a score of 1-1.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by identifying the rows corresponding to these dates.\n\nStarting with June 18, 1998. Scanning through the \"date\" column:\n\nRow 1: 1998-02-08 \u2013 that's February, not relevant.\nRow 2: 1998-03-14 \u2013 March, nope.\nRow 3: 1998-03-18 \u2013 March again, not June.\nRow 4: 1998-03-28 \u2013 Still March.\nRow 5: 1998-04-22 \u2013 April, moving on.\nRow 6: 1998-05-17 \u2013 May.\nRow 7: 1998-05-21 \u2013 Also May.\nRow 8: 1998-06-01 \u2013 June but the 1st, not 18th.\nRow 9: 1998-06-03 \u2013 Still June but 3rd.\nRow 10: 1998-06-06 \u2013 June 6th.\nRow 11: 1998-06-12 \u2013 June 12th, getting closer but not 18th yet.\nRow 12: 1998-06-19 \u2013 Wait, this is June 19th. The claim mentions June 18th, so no match here.\n\nHmm, I don't see a row with the date 1998-06-18. That suggests that there's no game on June 18 according to the table provided. But let me double-check in case I missed it.\n\nLooking again at rows 1 through 14:\n\nRow 13: 1998-06-24 \u2013 June 24th, so after June 18.\nRow 14: 1998-06-28 \u2013 That's the second date in the claim.\n\nSo for June 18, I found no corresponding row. Now, checking June 28, 1998:\n\nLooking at Row 14: The date is 1998-06-28, which matches. Let's check the score here. The \"score\" column shows \"0 - 0 (1 - 0 aet)\". That means the game ended in a 0-0 draw during regular time but went into extra time where the score became 1-0.\n\nThe claim states that both games have a score of 1-1, but for June 28, the score isn't 1-1. It's either 0-0 or 1-0 depending on whether it's considering regular time or extra time. However, in the context of standard scores, especially as presented in the table where some entries include both regular and extra time results, I think the main score is considered, which for Row 14 is 0-0.\n\nTherefore, June 28 doesn't have a 1-1 score either.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm if there's any other row that might be incorrectly identified as June 18. Perhaps in another format? The table uses dates in YYYY-MM-DD format, so June 18 would be 1998-06-18. Scanning through, I don't see this date listed.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are incorrect: there's no game on June 18, and the game on June 28 doesn't have a 1-1 score.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states that during July 1998, there were three World Cup games, and all of them took place in Japan.\n\nLooking at the table, I should check for entries where the competition (comp) is \"world cup\" and the date falls within July 1998. Additionally, I need to confirm if those games were held in Japan.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n- Rows 1 to 6: These have dates from February to May 1998, so they're outside the time frame we're interested in (July). Also, some are marked as 'kirin cup' which isn't the World Cup. So these can be ignored.\n\n- Rows 7 and 8: Again, Row 7 is May 21, 1998, still not July. However, the venue for Row 7 is in Japan, but it's part of the 'kirin cup', not the World Cup. Similarly, Row 8 is June 1, which is before July.\n\n- Rows 9 to 14: These have dates starting from June 3, 1998, up to June 28. The earliest date in this section is June 3, and the last is June 28. None of these fall into July. So all World Cup games listed are in June 1998.\n\nNow, checking specifically for July:\n\n- There's no row with a date in July 1998 in the table. The latest dates are in June. Therefore, there are zero World Cup games listed for July 1998.\n\nMoreover, even if we were to consider whether any World Cup games were held in Japan during that period, looking at the venues:\n\n- Only Row 7 is in Japan (kobe universiade memorial stadium), but it's not a World Cup game as its competition is 'kirin cup'. All World Cup games listed are in France and other European countries, with no entries from July.\n\nTherefore, the claim that there were three World Cup games in July 1998 all held in Japan isn't supported by the data.

Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nLooking at Row 8: The date is 1998-06-01, venue is Philips Stadion Eindhoven (Netherlands), score is 5-1, competition 'f', report 457. This seems to be a match in the Netherlands, but I don't know who they played against here.\n\nRow 9: Date is 1998-06-03, venue Steaua Stadium Bucharest (Romania), score 3-2, competition 'f', report 458. This looks like a match in Romania, possibly involving the Romanian team.\n\nNow, checking if there's a game between Netherlands and Romania on June 24 or June 28.\n\nLooking at Row 11: Date is 1998-06-12, venue Stade de la Mosson Montpellier (France), score 0-0, World Cup. Doesn't involve the Netherlands or Romania.\n\nRow 13: Date 1998-06-24, venue Stade de Toulouse France, score 1-3, World Cup. Opposing teams aren't specified here, but it's a World Cup match in France. I don't see Netherlands or Romania mentioned.\n\nRow 14: Date 1998-06-28, venue Stade Felix Bollaert Lens France, score 0-0 (aet), World Cup. Again, not involving the two countries in question.\n\nWait, maybe the Netherlands and Romania didn't play each other on those specific dates? Let me check all rows for any mentions of both teams.\n\nRow 8: Netherlands as venue but opponent isn't clear.\nRow 9: Romania's stadium, so likely their home game, but who did they play?\n\nLooking at the report numbers might help. Reports are numbered sequentially from 450 to 459 and then jumps to 'report' for World Cup matches.\n\nWait, maybe I should cross-reference the reports. But without more info on opponents, it's hard to tell if Netherlands and Romania played each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is about the Netherlands playing on June 24 and Romania on June 28? Let me check:\n\nLooking for any match with Netherlands on June 24: No, all the Netherlands entries are before that. The last match in Row 10 is June 6th.\n\nSimilarly, Romania's matches seem to be only in Row 9 (June 3rd). There's no entry for Romania on June 28 either.\n\nSo the claim states both teams have games on those dates respectively. But from the table, neither team played on those specific dates as per the entries provided.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Netherlands and Romania had matches on June 24 and June 28, 1998, respectively. Checking the table:\n\n- No entry shows a match involving the Netherlands or Romania on June 24 or 28, 1998.\n\nThus, the claim is false as there's no evidence in the table supporting these matches occurred on those dates.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says, \"the game on June 18 and 28, both have a score of 2-0.\" \n\nFirst, let me look through each row in the table to find games that occurred on June 18 and June 28.\n\nLooking at Row 6: Date is May 17, so not relevant. Row 7: May 21. Not relevant. Row 8: June 1, 5-1 score. Doesn't match. Row 9: June 3, 3-2. No. Row 10: June 6, 1-0. Also doesn't fit.\n\nNow, looking for games on June 18 and June 28. Checking each row:\n\nRow 11: Date is June 12, score 0-0. Not relevant.\nRow 12: June 19, 0-0. Still not the dates in the claim.\nRow 13: June 24, score 1-3. Doesn't match.\nRow 14: June 28, score is 0-0 (with aet). The score isn't 2-0.\n\nWait, I also need to check if there's a game on June 18. Let me go back through the rows:\n\nRows 1-5 are before May, so no. Rows 6-7 in May as well. Rows 8-9 in early June. Row 10: June 6, which is earlier than 18th. So, looking further down, Row 11: June 12. Then Row 12 is June 19. There's no game on June 18 listed here.\n\nSo for the claim, both games on June 18 and 28 should have a score of 2-0. However, in the table:\n\n- There's no game on June 18.\n- The game on June 28 has a score of 0-0 (with extra time), not 2-0.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because neither date has a 2-0 score. In fact, there's no data for June 18 and June 28's score doesn't match.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
