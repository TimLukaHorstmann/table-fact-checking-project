The home team is San Antonio Spurs, and the score is 106 - 121. So, in this game, the Spurs scored 121 points.\n\nNext, checking Row 7: This row is for December 14, 1976. Again, the home team is San Antonio Spurs with a score of 98 - 111. Here, the Spurs scored 111 points.\n\nComparing both dates, on December 11 they scored more (121) than on December 14 (111). Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the San Antonio Spurs scored more points on December 11 than on December 14.

I need to determine if the claim \"the san antonio spur be the visit team during 8 game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table data. Each row represents a game with details like date, visitor, score, home, and record. The claim is about whether San Antonio Spurs were the visiting team in eight games.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Visitor is San Antonio Spurs. So that's one.\n2. **Row 2**: Again, Spurs are visitors. That's two.\n3. **Row 3**: Spurs as visitors again. Now three.\n4. **Row 4**: The visitor is Atlanta Hawks; Spurs are at home. Not relevant here.\n5. **Row 5**: Spurs visiting Milwaukee Bucks. Four games now.\n6. **Row 6**: New Orleans Jazz visiting Spurs. So Spurs are home, not counting towards the claim.\n7. **Row 7**: New York Knicks visiting Spurs. Again, Spurs are home. Doesn't count.\n8. **Row 8**: Spurs visiting Indiana Pacers. That's five.\n9. **Row 9**: Spurs visiting Chicago Bulls. Now six.\n10. **Row 10**: Spurs visiting Cleveland Cavaliers. Seven games.\n11. **Row 11**: Golden State Warriors visiting Spurs. So Spurs are home, not counting.\n12. **Row 12**: Washington Bullets visiting Spurs. Again, Spurs at home. Doesn't add to the count.\n13. **Row 13**: Spurs visiting Kansas City Kings. That's eight games.\n14. **Row 14**: Philadelphia 76ers visiting Spurs. So, Spurs are home here as well.\n\nSo, counting all rows where the visitor is San Antonio Spurs: Rows 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, and 13. That makes eight instances where they were the visiting team. \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because they were indeed the visitors in exactly eight games.\n\nNext, I need to list all the relevant cells that support this conclusion. Each of these rows (1-3,5,8-10,13) have the \"visitor\" column set as San Antonio Spurs.

It seems to be saying that San Antonio Spurs played against Kansas City Kings after they had played against Cleveland Cavaliers. So, I need to check if there's a sequence where Spurs first played against Cavaliers and then against Kings.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- Row 10: Date December 19, 1976, visitor is San Antonio Spurs vs Cleveland Cavaliers (score 105 - 106). The record after this game is 14 - 16.\n- Next, I need to find if there's a subsequent game where Spurs played against Kansas City Kings. \n\nLooking at Row 13: Date December 26, 1976, visitor is San Antonio Spurs vs Kansas City Kings (score 110 - 105).

It says that San Antonio played against Los Angeles Lakers after playing Phoenix Suns. So, I need to check if there's a game where they played the Lakers and see if it comes after their game against the Suns.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game. The rows are in chronological order since the dates are sequential from December 2nd to December 28th, 1976.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: San Antonio vs Golden State on Dec 2\n- Row 2: San Antonio vs Los Angeles Lakers on Dec 3\n- Row 3: San Antonio vs Phoenix Suns on Dec 5\n\nWait a minute. The game against the Lakers is on Dec 3, and against the Suns is on Dec 5. So according to this, they played Lakers before Suns, which contradicts the claim that they played Lakers after Suns.\n\nSo the claim says Lakers came after Suns, but in reality, it's the opposite. Therefore, the claim should be FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells for each game:\n\nFor Los Angeles Lakers:\n- Row 2 has date Dec 3, visitors San Antonio Spurs, home LA Lakers\n\nFor Phoenix Suns:\n- Row 3 has date Dec 5, visitors San Antonio, home Phoenix Suns\n\nSo these are the relevant rows and columns.

The claim states: \"the san antonio spur score equal point on december 11 , 1976 and on december 14 , 1976.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down what this means. The claim is saying that San Antonio Spurs scored an equal number of points on both December 11 and December 14, 1976.\n\nI'll start by looking for the relevant rows in the table corresponding to these dates.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- Row 6 has the date December 11, 1976. The visitor is San Antonio Spurs, scoring 106 points against the home team New Orleans Jazz who scored 121.\n- Row 7 has the date December 14, 1976. Again, the visitor is San Antonio Spurs, scoring 98 points against the home team New York Knicks who scored 111.\n\nSo, on December 11: Spurs scored 106 points.\nOn December 14: Spurs scored 98 points.\n\nThe claim says these scores are equal. Comparing the two, 106 is not equal to 98. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells in the table that were checked. For each date:\n- For December 11 (Row 6), we look at the 'visitor' and 'score' columns.\n- For December 14 (Row 7), similarly, we check 'visitor' and 'score'.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Row 6, column 'visitor'\n- Row 6, column 'score'\n- Row 7, column 'visitor'\n- Row 7, column 'score'\n\nThis helps confirm that the Spurs were indeed the visitors on both dates and their scores in those games.

The claim says: \"the San Antonio Spurs do not score less than 100 points during any game after December 19, 1976.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has rows with dates, visitors, scores (visitor - home), home teams, and records. Each row represents a game on a specific date.\n\nThe claim is about games that occurred after December 19, 1976. So, I need to find all the rows where the date is later than December 19th. Let me list out the dates of each row:\n\nRow 1: Dec 2\nRow 2: Dec 3\nRow 3: Dec 5\nRow 4: Dec 8\nRow 5: Dec 10\nRow 6: Dec 11\nRow 7: Dec 14\nRow 8: Dec 15\nRow 9: Dec 17\nRow 10: Dec 19\nRows 11 to 14 are after Dec 19.\n\nSo, rows 11-14 are the games after December 19. Now, I need to check each of these rows to see if San Antonio Spurs scored less than 100 points in any of them.\n\nLooking at row 11: The visitors are Golden State Warriors vs. San Antonio Spurs at home. The score is 123-120. Here, the visitor's score is 123 and the home is 120. Since San Antonio is the home team, their score is 120, which is above 100.\n\nRow 12: Washington Bullets vs. Spurs at home. The score is 116-118. Again, Spurs scored 118, which is above 100.\n\nRow 13: Spurs are visitors against Kansas City Kings. Score is 110-105. As the visitor, their score is 110, still above 100.\n\nRow 14: Philadelphia 76ers vs. Spurs at home. The score is 116-127. Here, Spurs scored 127 as the home team, which is well above 100.\n\nWait, but I should also check if any of these rows have a visitor or home where San Antonio's points are below 100. From what I see, in all these rows, whether they're home or away, their scores are:\n\nRow 11: 120 (home)\nRow 12: 118 (home)\nRow 13: 110 (visitor)\nRow 14: 127 (home)\n\nAll of these are above 100. So, the claim seems to hold true because after Dec 19, in all their games, they didn't score less than 100 points.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if I missed any rows or dates. The last game is on December 28, which is row 14. All the relevant rows are checked, and none of them have San Antonio scoring below 100. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that after December 19, 1976, the San Antonio Spurs did not score less than 100 points in any game.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the san antonio spur do not score less than 100 points during any game before december 19, 1976.\"\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim correctly. It seems there's a typo; it should be \"San Antonio Spurs\" instead of \"spur.\" So, we're looking at games where the San Antonio Spurs are either visitors or home teams, and their score is less than 100 points before December 19, 1976.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table up to December 19, 1976. The claim is about games before that date, so I need to check all rows from Row 1 (December 2) up to and including Row 9 (December 17), since Row 10 is on December 19.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- **Row 1**: Date Dec 2, Spurs as visitors. Their score is 116, which is above 100.\n- **Row 2**: Dec 3, Spurs as visitors. Score 105, still above 100.\n- **Row 3**: Dec 5, Spurs as visitors. Score 98. This is below 100. So the claim would be false here because they scored less than 100 before December 19.\n\nWait, but I should check all relevant games. Let me continue to ensure there are no other instances before Dec 19 where Spurs scored under 100.\n\n- **Row 4**: Dec 8, Hawks visiting Spurs. The visitor score is 117 (Hawks) and home score 106 (Spurs). So Spurs scored 106, which is above 100.\n- **Row 5**: Dec 10, Spurs as visitors. Score 136, well above.\n- **Row 6**: Dec 11, Jazz visiting Spurs. Home score is 121 (Spurs), so that's good.\n- **Row 7**: Dec 14, Knicks vs. Spurs. Spurs scored 111, which is fine.\n- **Row 8**: Dec 15, Spurs as visitors. Score 102, just above 100.\n- **Row 9**: Dec 17, Spurs as visitors. Score 101, still above.\n\nWait a minute, in Row 3 (Dec 5), the Spurs scored 98 points when visiting Phoenix. That's below 100 and before December 19. Therefore, the claim is false because there was at least one game where they scored less than 100 before that date.\n\nAdditionally, looking further after Dec 19:\n\n- **Row 10**: Dec 19, Spurs as visitors, score 105 vs. Cavaliers. But since it's on Dec 19, not before, it doesn't affect the claim.\n\nSo, the relevant cell is Row 3 where Spurs scored 98, which is under 100 and before the specified date.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the san antonio spur be the visit team less frequently than they be the home team",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"the san antonio spur be the visit team less frequently than they be the home team.\" Hmm, wait, I think there's a typo in the name\u2014probably should be \"San Antonio Spurs\" instead of \"spur,\" but I'll proceed with that assumption.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It claims that San Antonio Spurs were visiting teams less often than they were home teams during these games listed in the table. So, I need to count how many times they were visitors versus how many times they were at home.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, visitor, score, home team, and record. The relevant columns for this claim are \"visitor\" and \"home.\" \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Visitor is San Antonio Spurs; Home is Golden State Warriors.\nSo here, Spurs were visitors.\n\nRow 2: Same as Row 1.Visitor is Spurs again.\n\nRow 3: Visitor is Spurs once more.\n\nRow 4: Visitor is Atlanta Hawks; Home is Spurs. So here, Spurs are home.\n\nRow 5: Visitor is Spurs.\n\nRow 6: Visitor is New Orleans Jazz; Home is Spurs. So Spurs at home.\n\nRow 7: Visitor is New York Knicks; Home is Spurs. Again, Spurs are home.\n\nRow 8: Visitor is Spurs.\n\nRow 9: Visitor is Spurs again.\n\nRow 10: Visitor is Spurs once more.\n\nRow 11: Visitor is Golden State Warriors; Home is Spurs. So they're home here.\n\nRow 12: Visitor is Washington Bullets; Home is Spurs. They are home again.\n\nRow 13: Visitor is Spurs.\n\nRow 14: Visitor is Philadelphia 76ers; Home is Spurs. So home.\n\nNow, let's count the number of times Spurs were visitors and when they were home.\n\nVisitors:\nRows where \"visitor\" column is San Antonio Spurs: Rows 1,2,3,5,8,9,10,13. That's 8 times.\n\nHome:\nRows where \"home\" column is San Antonio Spurs: Rows 4,6,7,11,12,14. Wait, let me recount:\n\nRow 4: Home is Spurs.\nRow 6: Home is Spurs.\nRow 7: Home is Spurs.\nRow 11: Home is Spurs.\nRow 12: Home is Spurs.\nRow 14: Home is Spurs.\n\nThat's 6 times as home teams.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the total number of rows is 14. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRows where Spurs are visitors:\nRow 1 (visitor)\nRow 2\nRow3\nRow5\nRow8\nRow9\nRow10\nRow13: So that's 8 times.\n\nRows where Spurs are home:\nRow4,6,7,11,12,14. That's 6 rows.\n\nSo in total, they were visitors 8 times and home 6 times. The claim is that they visited less frequently than being home, meaning the number of visits should be less than home games.\n\nBut here, 8 > 6, so the Spurs were visiting more often than being home. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because they were actually visiting teams more frequently than home teams.\n\nSo the answer would be FALSE, and the relevant cells are all the rows where either visitor or home team was San Antonio Spurs.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"home\"}\n   ]\n}",
