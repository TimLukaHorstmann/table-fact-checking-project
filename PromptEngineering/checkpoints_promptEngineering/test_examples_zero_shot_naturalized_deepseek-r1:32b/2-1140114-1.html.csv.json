The date here is 20 June, and again, the 'winning driver' is listed as Juan Manuel Fangio.

That means the tyre type for this race was \"c\", not \"p\".\n\nNext, I'll check the Indianopolis 500. Looking at Row 2, the \"tyre\" column indicates \"f\". So here too, the tyre used wasn't \"p\".\n\nSince both races in question did not use tyre type \"p\", the claim is incorrect.
