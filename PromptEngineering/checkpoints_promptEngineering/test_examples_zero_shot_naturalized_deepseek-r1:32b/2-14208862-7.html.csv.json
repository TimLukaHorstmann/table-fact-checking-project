    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the game on march 8 be play by minnesota (home) and philadelphia (visitor)\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look for any row in the table where the date is March 8. Scanning through the rows, I see that Row 5 has the date as March 8. That's a good start.\n\nNext, the claim mentions that Minnesota was the home team and Philadelphia was the visitor. So I need to check the 'home' and 'visitor' columns for Row 5. \n\nLooking at Row 5:\n- Home: minnesota\n- Visitor: philadelphia\n\nThis matches exactly what the claim is stating. So both conditions are satisfied.\n\nAdditionally, it's good practice to verify other details in case there might be any discrepancies or if I misread something. The score and decision columns don't impact this specific claim, but just for thoroughness, let me glance over them as well. The score was 6-2, which is a clear win for Philadelphia, but that's not relevant to the teams playing on that date.\n\nAlso, checking the attendance and record doesn't affect whether the teams played against each other on March 8. So focusing solely on the home and visitor columns is sufficient here.\n\nSince all parts of the claim are accurately represented in Row 5, there's no reason to doubt the validity of the statement. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking Row 5 for the date March 8, which shows Minnesota as the home team and Philadelphia as the visitor.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row__index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"edmonton be a visitor on march 9 to philadelphia , with a record of 44 - 7 - 15\".\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts:\n\n1. Edmonton was a visitor on March 9.\n2. The home team was Philadelphia that day.\n3. The team's record after that game was 44-7-15.\n\nI'll start by looking for the row where the date is March 9. Scanning through the rows, I see Row 6 has the date: march 9. Let me check the details there.\n\nIn Row 6:\n- Visitor: edmonton\n- Home: philadelphia\n\nSo, yes, Edmonton was visiting Philadelphia on March 9. That matches the first two parts of the claim.\n\nNext, checking the record after that game. The record is listed as \"44  - 7  - 15\" in Row 6. So the team's record was indeed 44-7-15 after their game on March 9.\n\nAll conditions in the claim are satisfied based on this row. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in Row 6 where Edmonton visited Philadelphia on March 9 with a record of 44-7-15.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"quebec have a decision of myre, and a record of 44 - 7 - 15\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find any entry related to Quebec. Scanning through rows 1 to 17, I notice that most visitors are teams like Philadelphia, Montreal, Colorado, etc., but in row 15, the visitor is Quebec. That's our first clue\u2014Quebec appears only once in this table as a visitor.\n\nNow, looking at row 15: date is March 27, the visitor is Quebec, and the home team is Philadelphia. The score was 2-5. The decision is listed as Peeters, not Myre. So that's one point to check against the claim.\n\nThe claim says Quebec has a decision of Myre. But according to row 15, the decision is Peeters. That means this part isn't true. \n\nNext, checking the record for Quebec: The claim mentions a record of 44-7-15. However, in row 15, the record shown is 46-11-18. Wait, that's not matching. But actually, I need to clarify\u2014Quebec as a visitor would mean their own team's record isn't necessarily listed here; instead, it's Philadelphia's record after the game. So looking at row 15, the record is for Philadelphia, which is 46-11-18.\n\nBut the claim is about Quebec's record, not Philadelphia's. Since the table only shows the home team's (Philadelphia) record in each row, we don't have any information about Quebec's overall record elsewhere in this data. So there's no cell that provides Quebec's specific record; all records listed are for Philadelphia after each game.\n\nPutting it together: The decision for the game involving Quebec was Peeters, not Myre, and there's no relevant data on Quebec's record from the table. Therefore, both parts of the claim are unsupported by the information provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
