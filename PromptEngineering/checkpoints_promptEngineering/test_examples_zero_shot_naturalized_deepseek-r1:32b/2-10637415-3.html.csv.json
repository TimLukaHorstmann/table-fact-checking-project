Let me calculate the difference. \n\nWigan's points (4) minus London's points (2) equals 2. That matches exactly what the claim says. \n\nSo, yes, Wigan has 2 more points than London.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the wigan warrior club have the highest number of points\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It seems each row represents a different club with various statistics like 'played', 'lost', 'drawn', 'against', 'diff', and 'points'. The claim is about points, so I need to focus on the 'points' column for all clubs.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Wigan Warriors have 4 points. That's straightforward.\n\nRow 2: London Broncos have 2 points. So far, Wigan is ahead here.\n\nRow 3: Bradford Bulls have 0 points. Still, Wigan leads.\n\nRow 4: St Helens RLFC also has 0 points. Wigan still on top.\n\nRow 5: Warrington Wolves have 0 points as well. No change in the lead.\n\nRow 6: Halifax Blue Sox have 0 points too. \n\nSo, checking all the 'points' columns across each row, I see that only Wigan Warriors and London Broncos have positive points, with Wigan having 4 and London having 2. All others are at 0. Therefore, Wigan indeed has the highest number of points in this table.\n\nThe relevant cells to support this claim are the 'points' column for each row because we need to compare all clubs to ensure that Wigan's 4 points is the maximum. So, I'll list all rows with their respective 'points' columns as relevant.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The claim refers to \"the highest number of points,\" so focus on the 'points' column.\n\n2. **Compare Points Across Clubs**:\n   - Wigan Warriors: 4 points\n   - London Broncos: 2 points\n   - Bradford Bulls, St Helens RLFC, Warrington Wolves, Halifax Blue Sox: All have 0 points.\n\n3. **Determine the Highest**: Since 4 is greater than all other values in the 'points' column, Wigan Warriors have the highest number of points.\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"halifax blue sox be 1 of the 6 club that have no drawn record during the 1997 world club championship.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part means. So, it's saying that Halifax Blue Sox are one of six clubs with no drawn games in that championship.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are six rows, each representing a different club. Each row has columns like 'club', 'played', 'lost', 'drawn', etc. The relevant column here is 'drawn'.\n\nFor each club, I should check if their 'drawn' value is 0. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. Wigan Warriors: drawn is 0.\n2. London Broncos: drawn is 0.\n3. Bradford Bulls: drawn is 0.\n4. St Helens RLFC: drawn is 0.\n5. Warrington Wolves: drawn is 0.\n6. Halifax Blue Sox: drawn is 0.\n\nSo, all six clubs have a 'drawn' record of 0. That means none of them have any draws during the championship.\n\nNow, looking specifically at Halifax Blue Sox, their 'drawn' column is indeed 0. Therefore, they are one of the six clubs with no drawn games.\n\nWait, but does the claim say that there are exactly six clubs, and that Halifax is one of them? Since all six have no draws, including Halifax, it seems correct.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be each row's 'drawn' column to confirm they're all 0. That means checking rows 1 through 6 under 'drawn'.\n\nI think the claim holds true because every club, including Halifax Blue Sox, has a drawn record of 0.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE.

Let me start by understanding the structure of the table and the claim.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, each row represents a different club with various statistics. The relevant columns here are \"club\" and \"points\" since the claim is about points.\n\nLet's list out the points for each club:\n\n1. Wigan Warriors: 4 points\n2. London Broncos: 2 points\n3. Bradford Bulls: 0 points\n4. St Helens RLFC: 0 points\n5. Warrington Wolves: 0 points\n6. Halifax Blue Sox: 0 points\n\nNow, I need to determine the ranking of these clubs based on their points. The highest number of points is 4 (Wigan Warriors). The next highest would be any club with more than 2 but less than 4. However, London Broncos have 2 points, and all other clubs have 0.\n\nSo, Wigan Warriors are at the top with 4 points. There's no second place because after 4 points comes 2 points from London Broncos. Therefore, Wigan Warriors don't have the second highest; they actually have the highest number of points.\n\nThe claim states that Wigan Warriors have the second highest. Since they're first, this claim is incorrect.\n\nTo verify, I'll check each relevant cell:\n\n- For Wigan Warriors: Check \"points\" which is 4 (Row 1).\n- For London Broncos: Check \"points\" which is 2 (Row 2).\n\nSince no other club has more points than 4 except possibly the second highest, but since they're the only ones with 4, it's clear that Wigan Warriors are first. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to check are:\n\n- Row 1 (\"wigan warriors\") under \"points\"\n- Row 2 (\"london broncos\") under \"points\"\n\nThese two rows help determine the point standings.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me check: if Wigan has 4 points and Bradford has 0, the difference is 4 - 0 = 4 points. So, Wigan actually has 4 points more than Bradford, not just 2.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't accurate because the difference is larger than stated. \n\nTo determine the relevant cells, I need to look at which rows and columns were checked.
