    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"neuza silva have partner with ana catarina nogueira on 6 occasion\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim states that Neuza Silva partnered with Ana Catarina Nogueira on six different occasions. So, we're looking for rows in the table where both players were partners.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has a \"partnering\" column which lists who someone was partnering with. The key here is to find all instances where Ana Catarina Nogueira is listed as a partner and then check if Neuza Silva is mentioned alongside her.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Partnering with Angela Cardoso against Georgia. Neither Neuza Silva nor Ana Catarina Nogueira are here.\n2. **Row 2**: Partnering with Ana Catarina Nogueira against Norway. The opponents are Karoline Borgersen and Ina Sartz. No mention of Neuza Silva.\n3. **Row 3**: Partnering with Frederica Piedade against Turkey. Again, no mention of either.\n4. **Row 4**: Partnering with Ana Catarina Nogueira against Kenya. Opponents are Caroline Oduor and Tamara Orwa. Still, Neuza Silva isn't here.\n5. **Row 5**: Partnering with Ana Catarina Nogueira in the play-offs against Bosnia and Herzegovina. Opponents are Selma Babi\u0107 and Sanja Racic. No Neuza Silva again.\n6. **Row 6**: Partnering with Ana Catarina Nogueira against Poland. Opponents include Klaudia Jans and Alicja Rosolska. Still no mention of her.\n7. **Row 7**: Partnering with Ana Catarina Nogueira against Latvia. Opponents are Anastasija Sevastova and Alise Vaidere. No Neuza Silva here either.\n8. **Row 8**: Partnering with Ana Catarina Nogueira against Greece. Opponents are Anna Gerasimou and Anna Koumantou. Again, no Neuza Silva.\n9. **Row 9**: Partnering with Frederica Piedade against Morocco. No relevant names.\n10. **Row 10**: Partnering with Frederica Piedade against Latvia. Still nothing related to the claim.\n11. **Row 11**: Partnering with Michelle Larcher de Brito against Croatia. Opponents are Jelena Kostani\u0107 To\u0161i\u0107 and Silvia Njiri\u0107. No match here.\n12. **Row 12**: Partnering with Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler against Romania. Opponents include Irina-Camelia Begu and Ioana Raluca Oaru. No mention of either player.\n\nAfter reviewing all rows, I notice that Ana Catarina Nogueira appears as a partner in multiple instances (Rows 2,4,5,6,7,8), but in none of these is Neuza Silva mentioned as her partner. Each time, the partnering column lists someone else\u2014Angela Cardoso, Frederica Piedade, Michelle Larcher de Brito, or Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler. There's no row where both Ana Catarina Nogueira and Neuza Silva are listed as partners.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided data, there is no evidence that Neuza Silva partnered with Ana Catarina Nogueira on any occasion, let alone six. This leads me to conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not contain any instances where \"neuza silva\" and \"ana catarina nogueira\" are listed as partners together in the \"partnering\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_ cells\": []\n}\n```",

The claim is \"neuza silva have only play 4 match on a non-clay surface.\" First, I need to verify if there's any mention of Neuza Silva in the provided table. \n\nLooking through each row, I notice that the players listed as partners are Angela Cardoso, Ana Catarina Nogueira, Frederica Piedade, Michelle Larcher de Brito, and Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler. There's no entry for Neuza Silva anywhere in the table. Since she isn't present, there are zero matches associated with her.\n\nThe claim mentions that she played four matches on a non-clay surface, but without any data about her, we can't confirm this. In fact, all surfaces listed in the table (from rows 1 to 12) are either clay or hard, but since Neuza Silva isn't there, it's irrelevant.\n\nTherefore, the claim cannot be supported by the given data because she doesn't appear in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"neuza silva have compete on clay surface in 8 match\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each part of the claim means. The claim states that Neuza Silva has competed on a clay surface in eight matches. So, I need to check two things: whether any of her matches were played on clay and how many such matches there are.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists several rows with details about different Fed Cup editions, rounds, dates, partnering players, opponents, surfaces, and results. Each row represents a specific match or set of matches.\n\nI notice that the table doesn't mention \"neuza silva\" anywhere. The names listed under \"partnering\" are Angela Cardoso, Ana Catarina Nogueira, Frederica Piedade, Michelle Larcher de Brito, and Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler. None of these are Neuza Silva.\n\nSince the claim is about Neuza Silva's participation, I need to check if she appears in any row as a player involved. Scanning through all 12 rows, there's no mention of her name either under \"partnering\" or \"opponents.\" The opponents' names include various players from different countries, but none are Neuza Silva.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the surfaces, many matches were on clay (rows 1-8), some on hard (rows 9-12). But again, without any mention of Neuza Silva in these rows, it's impossible for her to have competed in any of these matches, let alone eight on clay.\n\nTherefore, since there's no information about Neuza Silva in the table, the claim can't be supported. The answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Neuza Silva is not mentioned in the provided table data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "claim": "neuza silva have only partner with maria jo\u00e3o koehler 1 time",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"neuza silva have only partner with maria jo\u00e3o koehler 1 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It claims that Neuza Silva partnered with Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler exactly once. So I need to check how many times Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler appears as a partner in the table and see if it's only once.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match where someone was partnering with another player. The relevant columns here are \"partnering\" and \"against\". But wait, actually, the \"partnering\" column shows who the person was playing with, right? So for example, in Row 2, it says \"partnering: ana catarina nogueira\", meaning that Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler might be one of the opponents or maybe the partnering player.\n\nWait no, I think I need to clarify. The table's structure is a bit confusing. Let me look at each row again:\n\nRow 1: Partnering Angela Cardoso against Georgia.\nRow 2: Partnering Ana Catarina Nogueira against Norway.\nAnd so on.\n\nSo in each row, the \"partnering\" column shows who was playing alongside another player (the person whose stats this table is about). But wait, actually, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe each row represents a match where someone was partnering with the main player (like Neuza Silva) or not? Hmm, that's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"partnering\" column refers to who the main player partnered with in doubles matches. So if the claim is about Neuza Silva partnering with Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler only once, I need to check how many times Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler appears as a partner in the table where the main player is partnering her.\n\nBut looking at the table, none of the rows mention \"neuza silva\" as the partnering player. The partnering players listed are Angela Cardoso, Ana Catarina Nogueira, Frederica Piedade, and others. So if Neuza Silva isn't listed in any of the \"partnering\" columns, that means she didn't partner with anyone in these matches according to this table.\n\nTherefore, Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler doesn't appear as a partner for Neuza Silva because Neuza Silva isn't listed as partnering anyone here. So the claim is saying that Neuza Silva only partnered once with Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler, but based on this table, there's no evidence of them partnering at all. Therefore, the claim might be FALSE.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Perhaps the table lists matches where a certain player (maybe Neuza Silva) was playing against others. So in that case, \"partnering\" would refer to her teammates or opponents? Let me check again.\n\nIn Row 12: edition is 2010 Fed Cup Europe/Africa Group I, round rr, date 4-5 February 2010, partnering Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler against Romania. So in this row, the person was partnering with Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler, meaning that Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler was her partner.\n\nSo if Neuza Silva is the main player in question, and she partnered with Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler only once, then we need to see how many times Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler appears as a partner in the table. In this case, Row 12 shows that Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler was a partner. Are there any other rows where she's listed as a partner?\n\nLooking through all the rows:\n\nRow 1: Angela Cardoso\nRow 2: Ana Catarina Nogueira\nRow 3: Frederica Piedade\n... and so on until Row 12, which is Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler.\n\nSo only in Row 12 does Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler appear as a partner. Therefore, the claim that Neuza Silva partnered with her only once is TRUE because there's exactly one instance where Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler was her partner.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if Neuza Silva isn't listed in any of the partnering columns, maybe she wasn't playing at all. But Row 12 shows that the partnering player was Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler against Romania. So perhaps the main player is someone else, and the claim refers to Neuza Silva as the one partnering with others.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: The table seems to list matches where a specific player (maybe Neuza Silva) partnered with someone else in doubles. Each row shows who she partnered with and against whom they played.\n\nSo if that's the case, then looking through all the rows:\n\n- Row 12 is the only one where Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler is listed as the partnering player. So if Neuza Silva is the main player, she partnered once with Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler in that match.\n\nBut I need to confirm whether the claim refers to Neuza Silva being the partner or the one being partnered with. The claim says \"Neuza Silva have only partner with maria jo\u00e3o koehler 1 time,\" which implies that Neuza was partnering with Maria Jo\u00e3o once.\n\nSo if only Row 12 shows Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler as a partner, and no other rows do so, then the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table lists instances where someone partnered with others. Only in Row 12 does Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler appear as a partner, indicating Neuza Silva partnered once with her.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"partnering\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"neuza silva have reach play off only 1 time in 2005\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It's saying that Neuza Silva participated in a playoff only once in the year 2005. So, I need to check two things: whether there are any instances of Neuza Silva playing in playoffs and if she did so only once in 2005.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match from different years, ranging from 2002 to 2010. The columns include edition, round, date, partnering, against, surface, opponents, and result.\n\nI notice that the player in question is Neuza Silva. However, when I scan through all the rows (from row 1 to row 12), I don't see any mention of \"Neuza Silva\" in the partnering column. The partners listed are Angela Cardoso, Ana Catarina Nogueira, Frederica Piedade, Michelle Larcher de Brito, and Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler.\n\nNext, I check for the round type. The claim mentions a playoff, which would correspond to the \"round\" column. In the table, rounds are either labeled as \"rr\" (which stands for Round Robin) or \"giii play-offs\". For example, row 5 is in the group iii play-offs.\n\nLooking specifically at the year 2005, there are three entries:\n- Row 4: Edition 2005 Fed Cup Europe/Africa Group III, Round RR.\n- Row 5: Edition 2005 Fed Cup Europe/Africa Group III, Round giii play-offs.\n- Row 6 and beyond don't pertain to 2005.\n\nIn row 5, the partnering player is Ana Catarina Nogueira. There's no mention of Neuza Silva in this row or any other in 2005. \n\nSince there's no entry where the partner is Neuza Silva and no indication that she played in a playoff round (only Round Robin and one play-off by another player), it seems the claim isn't supported.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Neuza Silva doesn't appear in the table at all for 2005 or any other year. She didn't participate in any matches listed here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two names: Neuza Silva and Ana Catarina Nogueira. The claim states that they partnered five times. I'll check each row in the table to see if both these players are partners in any of the matches.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 1: Partnering is Angela Cardoso. Not Ana Catarina, so no.\nRow 2: Partnering is Ana Catarina Nogueira. But the claim mentions Neuza Silva as a partner; she's not listed here. Opponents are Margalita Chakhnashvili and Salome Devidze. No match for both partners mentioned in the claim.\nRow 3: Partnering is Frederica Piedade. Not Ana Catarina, so no.\nRow 4: Partnering is Ana Catarina Nogueira. Opponents are Caroline Oduor and Tamara Orwa. Still, Neuza Silva isn't here as a partner.\nRow 5: Partnering is Ana Catarina again. Opponents are Selma Babi\u0107 and Sanja Racic. No mention of Neuza Silva.\nRow 6: Partnering is Ana Catarina Nogueira. Opponents include Klaudia Jans and Alicja Rosolska. No Neuza here either.\nRow 7: Again, Partnering is Ana Catarina. Opponents are Anastasija Sevastova and Alise Vaidere. Still no Neuza Silva as a partner.\nRow 8: Partnering is Ana Catarina Nogueira once more. Opponents are Anna Gerasimou and Anna Koumantou. No match for the claim here.\nRow 9: Partnering is Frederica Piedade. Not Ana, so irrelevant.\nRow 10: Partnering is still Frederica Piedade. Doesn't help.\nRow 11: Partnering is Michelle Larcher de Brito. Not Ana, so no.\nRow 12: Partnering is Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler. Again, not Ana Catarina.\n\nWait a minute, none of the rows show both Neuza Silva and Ana Catarina Nogueira as partners in any match. The claim says they partnered five times, but according to this table, that's not happening at all. In fact, I don't see Neuza Silva anywhere in the partnering column except perhaps if she is one of the opponents, but the claim refers to her as a partner.\n\nSo, since there are zero instances where both Neuza Silva and Ana Catarina Nogueira are partners together, let alone five, the claim must be FALSE.

There's no mention of Neuza Silva anywhere in the table. That seems important.\n\nSince the claim is about Neuza Silva playing matches on non-hard surfaces, but she doesn't appear in the data at all, I can infer that there are zero matches for her.

So I'm looking for instances where she played on clay courts and count how many there are.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has 12 rows, each representing different Fed Cup matches from various years.

Additionally, the opponents' column lists various players from different countries, but again, I don't see Neuza Silva's name there either.\n\nSince the claim is about her competing on clay surfaces in nine matches, but the table doesn't mention her at all, it suggests that she didn't participate in any of these listed matches.

It mentions Neuza Silva reaching playoffs twice in the year 2005. So I need to check if there are two instances where she was involved in a playoff (probably in the \"result\" column) and that these instances occurred in 2005.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match played by Portugal, as indicated by the \"against\" column showing other countries like Georgia, Norway, etc. The key columns to look at are \"edition\", \"date\", \"partnering\", \"result\", and possibly others like \"round\".\n\nI should first identify all rows where the edition includes 2005 because that's the year in question. Scanning through:\n\nRow 4: Edition is 2005 Fed Cup Europe/Africa Group III, Round RR.\nRow 5: Edition is also 2005 Fed Cup Europe/Africa Group III, but the round is GIII Play-offs.\n\nSo rows 4 and 5 are from 2005.

So she's not listed as a partner in either match from 2005.\n\nWait, maybe I should check other columns like \"opponents\"? Let me see:\n\nIn row 4, opponents are Caroline Oduor and Tamara Orwa. Not her.\nRow 5: Opponents are Selma Babi\u0107 and Sanja Ra\u010di\u0107. Still not Neuza Silva.\n\nLooking at the entire table for any mention of Neuza Silva. Scanning all \"partnering\" columns across rows:\n\nRow 1: Angela Cardoso\nRow 2: Ana Catarina Nogueira\nRow 3: Frederica Piedade\nRow 4: Ana Catarina Nogueira\nRow 5: Ana Catarina Nogueira\nRow 6: Ana Catarina Nogueira\nRow 7: Ana Catarina Nogueira\nRow 8: Ana Catarina Nogueira\nRow 9: Frederica Piedade\nRow 10: Frederica Piedade\nRow 11: Michelle Larcher de Brito\nRow 12: Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler\n\nNo occurrence of Neuza Silva in any of the partnering columns. So she didn't partner in any matches listed here, especially not in 2005.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there are no entries for Neuza Silva in 2005, let alone reaching playoffs twice.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not list any participation by Neuza Silva in 2005. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
