    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim about Rhodesia's medals is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"Rhodesia have 2 bronze medal, 5 silver medal, and 10 gold medal.\" So, I'm looking for three specific numbers associated with Rhodesia in the table\u2014bronze, silver, and gold medals.\n\nLooking at the table, it's presented in rows where each row represents a nation along with their medal counts. The columns are rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, and total. \n\nI'll start by locating Rhodesia in the table. Scanning through the nations listed: United States, Great Britain, Italy, Australia, then Rhodesia is next at row index 5 (since counting starts from 0). So, row 5 corresponds to Rhodesia.\n\nNow, I need to check each medal category for this nation:\n\n1. **Gold Medals**: The claim says 10. Looking at the gold column in row 5, it shows 10. That matches.\n2. **Silver Medals**: The claim mentions 5. Checking the silver column in row 5, it's indeed 5. That also matches.\n3. **Bronze Medals**: The claim states 2. Looking at the bronze column for Rhodesia, it is 2. This matches as well.\n\nSince all three numbers (10 gold, 5 silver, and 2 bronze) align with the data in row 5 of the table, the claim is fully supported by the information provided. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nAdditionally, to comply with the instructions, I need to list the relevant cells that were checked. These are the cells in row 5 under the columns gold, silver, and bronze.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
