    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"in 1975, the denver bronco never have more than 2 win in a row\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states that during the 1975 season for the Denver Broncos (I think they meant Broncos instead of Bronco), there were no instances where they won three games consecutively; their maximum consecutive wins in a row were two or fewer.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week with details about the game. The relevant columns here are \"week\", \"result\", and \"record\". I need to check the results of each game to see if there's any instance where they won three games in a row.\n\nStarting from Week 1:\n- Week 1: Win (37-33)\n- Week 2: Another win (23-13)\nSo, that's two wins in a row. \n\nWeek 3 was a loss, so the streak is broken here. So far, only two consecutive wins.\n\nContinuing through the weeks:\nWeek 4: Loss\nWeek 5: Win (16-15)\nBut since it's not consecutive after Week 2, it doesn't add to the previous streak.\n\nLooking further down the table, let me check other weeks where there were multiple consecutive wins. \n\nWeeks 1 and 2 are two wins in a row.\nThen, looking at Weeks 5: Win (3-2 record), but Week 6 is a loss, so that's just one win.\nWeek 9: Another win, followed by a loss in Week 10.\nWeek 11: A win against the Chargers in overtime. The previous game was a loss, so this doesn't continue a streak.\n\nSo, in all cases, the maximum consecutive wins are two games (Weeks 1 and 2). There's no point where they won three games consecutively during that season. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because they never had more than two consecutive wins.\n</think>\n\nThe Denver Broncos did not have any instance of winning three games in a row during the 1975 season as per the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"the lowest attendance for at Denver Broncos game in 1975 be at the San Diego Stadium.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim is saying. It's talking about the lowest attendance for a Denver Broncos game during the 1975 season, and it claims that this happened when they were playing at San Diego Stadium.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see that there are 14 rows, each representing a week in the season. Each row has details like the opponent, result, game site, attendance, etc. So, my task is to find out which games had the lowest attendances and check if any of them were played at San Diego Stadium.\n\nI'll start by looking through all the \"attendance\" column values. Let me list them out:\n\n- Week 1: 51858\n- Week 2: 52621\n- Week 3: 79864\n- Week 4: 49169\n- Week 5: 52590\n- Week 6: 70043\n- Week 7: 52505\n- Week 8: 49919\n- Week 9: 26048\n- Week 10: 28686\n- Week 11: 44982\n- Week 12: 51075\n- Week 13: 36860\n- Week 14: 43064\n\nNow, I need to identify the lowest attendance. Scanning through these numbers, the smallest number is 26048 in week 9 and 28686 in week 10. So, the two lowest attendances are at weeks 9 and 10.\n\nNext, I need to check where those games were played. Let's look at the \"game site\" for these rows:\n\n- Week 9: san diego stadium\n- Week 10: atlanta-fulton county stadium\n\nSo, week 9 was in San Diego Stadium with attendance 26048, and week 10 was in Atlanta with 28686. Comparing the two, week 9 has a lower attendance.\n\nThe claim states that the lowest attendance was at San Diego Stadium. Based on the data, this is correct because week 9 had the lowest attendance of 26048 and was played at San Diego Stadium.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are from week 9 where both the \"attendance\" and \"game site\" columns are key to verifying the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the attendance numbers and their corresponding game sites in the table. The lowest attendance occurred at San Diego Stadium during week 9.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The key elements are:\n- Year: 1975\n- Team: Denver Broncos (though the table uses \"denver bronco,\" which might be a typo)\n- Points scored in losses: Specifically, looking for their highest score in games they lost.\n- Claim states that the most points scored in a loss was 21.\n\nNow, I'll check the table row by row to find all the games where Denver lost and note the points they scored. The table doesn't explicitly mention the team as \"Denver Broncos,\" but given the context and game sites like Mile High Stadium, it's safe to assume these are their games.\n\nLooking through each row:\n- Row 1: Result is a win (W), so not relevant.\n- Row 2: Also a win, so skip.\n- Row 3: Loss (L) with result 14-38. Denver scored 14 points here.\n- Row 4: Another loss, result 9-20. They scored 9 points.\n- Row 5: Win again, not relevant.\n- Row 6: Loss, result 13-26. They scored 13 points.\n- Row 7: Loss, 17-42. Scored 17 points.\n- Row 8: Loss, 16-17. Denver scored 16 points here.\n- Row 9: Win, so not relevant.\n- Row 10: Loss, result 21-35. They scored 21 points.\n- Rows 11 to 14: Various results; I need to check for losses.\n\nWait, looking back at row 10, the opponent is Atlanta Falcons, date November 23. The result is L 21-35. So Denver lost this game and scored 21 points. \n\nNow, are there any other games where Denver lost with a higher score than 21?\n\nLooking through all the losses:\n- Row 3: 14\n- Row 4:9\n- Row6:13\n- Row7:17\n- Row8:16\n- Row10:21\n\nSo the highest points Denver scored in a loss is indeed 21, which happened in row 10. \n\nWait, but I need to confirm if all these games are from 1975 as per the claim. The table doesn't specify the year, just the dates. The earliest date is September 21 and the latest is December 20. If we assume that the season is for 1975, then the data aligns with that year.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided table, in 1975, Denver Broncos' highest score in a loss was 21 points.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's see what the user is asking here. They've given me a table with data about Denver Broncos games in 1975 and a claim that needs verification. The task is to determine if the claim \"in 1975, the denver bronco go in overtime only 1 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It has rows from week 1 to week 14, each with details like date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. The important column here for the claim is the \"result\" because that's where overtime would be mentioned if it occurred.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions overtime only once in 1975. So I need to scan through each row's result to see how many times the Broncos went into overtime.\n\nLooking at row by row:\n\n- Week 1: Result is W 37-33 \u2013 no mention of OT.\n- Week 2: W 23-13 \u2013 same, nothing about OT.\n- Week 3: L 14-38 \u2013 no OT here either.\n- Week 4: L 9-20 \u2013 still no indication of overtime.\n- Week 5: W 16-15 \u2013 close game but no OT noted.\n- Week 6: L 13-26 \u2013 nothing about OT.\n- Week 7: L 17-42 \u2013 same.\n- Week 8: L 16-17 \u2013 again, no mention of OT.\n- Week 9: W 27-17 \u2013 straightforward result.\n- Week 10: L 21-35 \u2013 nothing about overtime.\n- Week 11: Result is W 13-10 (OT) \u2013 here we go! This is the first and only instance where overtime is mentioned in the results.\n- Weeks 12 to 14: No OT in any of these results.\n\nSo, from row 1 to 14, I found only one game that went into overtime, which is week 11. That supports the claim that there was only one overtime game in 1975 for the Denver Broncos.\n\nI need to make sure that I didn't miss any other rows where OT might be mentioned. Scanning through again, no other rows have \"OT\" in their result column except row 11. Therefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cell is week 11's result.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows only one game with an overtime result (row 11), confirming the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break down the claim and check each part against the data.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions the year 1975. Looking at the table, all rows have dates in September to December, but no specific year is mentioned. Since it's about Denver Broncos' games, I can assume this might be a particular season, possibly around that time period, but the exact year isn't provided. However, for this exercise, let's proceed with the assumption that the table refers to the 1975 season.\n\nNext, the claim states that they \"finish the season with a loss at the miami orange bowl.\" So, I need to check if the last game of the season is indeed a loss against Miami Dolphins at Miami Orange Bowl.\n\nLooking at the rows, the table has 14 weeks (rows 1 to 14). The last row is week 14. Let's examine that row:\n\n- Week: 14\n- Date: December 20\n- Opponent: Miami Dolphins\n- Result: L 13 - 14\n- Game Site: Miami Orange Bowl\n\nSo, the result was a loss (L) with the score 13-14. The game took place at Miami Orange Bowl against the Miami Dolphins.\n\nTherefore, this aligns with the claim that they finished the season with a loss at Miami Orange Bowl in week 14.\n\nAdditionally, since this is the last row of the table (row index 13 if we start counting from 0), it's reasonable to assume this was the final game of the season. So, all parts of the claim are supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 1975, the Denver Broncos finished their season with a loss at the Miami Orange Bowl. The table shows that week 14 (the last row) is a loss against Miami Dolphins at Miami Orange Bowl, confirming the claim.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Year Assumption:** The table doesn't specify the year, but based on context, it's assumed to be the 1975 season as per the claim.\n2. **Check Final Game Outcome:** The last game (week 14) is a loss against Miami Dolphins with the result L 13-14.\n3. **Game Location Verification:** The final game was played at Miami Orange Bowl, matching the claim.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"In 1975, the Denver Broncos never have more than 1 win in a row.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is about. It's talking about the Denver Broncos' performance in 1975, specifically whether they ever had two consecutive wins in that season. If they didn't have any instances of winning two games back-to-back, then the claim would be TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a week in the season with details like the opponent, result, and record. The \"record\" column shows the team's overall win-loss record after each game.\n\nI need to check each game result to see if there are two consecutive weeks where the Broncos won both games. Let me go through each week step by step:\n\n- Week 1: Result is a win (W) with a record of 1-0.\n- Week 2: Also a win, so now they have two consecutive wins. The record becomes 2-0.\n\nWait, right there in Weeks 1 and 2, the Broncos won both games consecutively. That means the claim that they never had more than one win in a row is FALSE because they did have at least two consecutive wins early on.\n\nLet me check further to see if this was an isolated case or if it happened again:\n\n- Week 3: They lost, so the streak ends.\n- Week 5: Another win (Week 5) but then they lose in Week 6. So that's only one win, not two in a row.\n- Week 9: Win, but next week (Week 10) they lose again.\n- Week 11: Win, and then in Week 13 another win. But between Week 11 and 13, there are other games, so it's not consecutive weeks.\n\nSo the only instance of two wins in a row is Weeks 1 and 2. Therefore, the claim that they never had more than one win in a row is false because they did have two consecutive wins early in the season.\n</think>\n\nThe Denver Broncos had two consecutive wins in Weeks 1 and 2, so the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the lowest attendance for a Denver Broncos game in 1975 was at Mile High Stadium\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at what the claim is saying. It states that the lowest attendance during any Denver Broncos game in 1975 occurred when they were playing at Mile High Stadium. To verify this, I need to check two main things: the attendance figures for each game and whether those games were played at Mile High Stadium.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists various weeks of games with details like date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. The key columns here are \"game site\" and \"attendance\". My task is to find out which games had the lowest attendances and whether those games were held at Mile High Stadium.\n\nLet me list out all the rows where the game site was Mile High Stadium:\n\n- Row 1: Attendance 51,858\n- Row 2: Attendance 52,621\n- Row 5: Attendance 52,590\n- Row 7: Attendance 52,505\n- Row 8: Attendance 49,919 (This is actually the lowest at Mile High Stadium)\n- Row 11: Attendance 44,982\n- Row 13: Attendance 36,860\n\nWait, hold on. I think I misread that. Let me correct myself. The attendance numbers for games at Mile High Stadium are:\n\nRow 1: 51,858  \nRow 2: 52,621  \nRow 5: 52,590  \nRow 7: 52,505  \nRow 8: 49,919  \nRow 11: 44,982  \nRow 13: 36,860  \n\nSo the lowest attendance at Mile High Stadium is in Row 13 with 36,860. Now, I need to check if this is indeed the lowest overall.\n\nLooking through all the attendances:\n\nRow 3: Rich Stadium - 79,864  \nRow 4: Three Rivers Stadium - 49,169  \nRow 6: Arrowhead Stadium - 70,043  \nRow 9: San Diego Stadium - 26,048  \nRow 10: Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium - 28,686  \nRow 12: Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum - 51,075  \nRows 1-2,5-8,11-13 are as listed.\n\nSo the lowest attendance overall is in Row 9 (San Diego Stadium) at 26,048 and Row 10 (Atlanta) at 28,686. Both of these are lower than any game played at Mile High Stadium. Therefore, the claim that the lowest attendance was at Mile High Stadium is FALSE because there were games with even lower attendances elsewhere.\n\nThus, the relevant cells to consider are all the \"attendance\" and \"game site\" columns for each row to identify which had the lowest numbers.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The user has provided a table of Denver Broncos' games from 1975, and they want to verify if the claim \"in 1975, the most points the Denver Broncos scored in a loss was 15\" is true or false.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each column represents. The columns are week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. Each row corresponds to a specific game played that year.\n\nThe claim mentions two key things: the highest points scored in a loss (15) and that this occurred in 1975. Since the table is for 1975, I don't need to check the year elsewhere; it's already implied by the context provided.\n\nNext, I'll focus on the \"result\" column because it indicates whether the Broncos won or lost each game. For losses, the format is 'L followed by the score, like L 14-38 or L 9-20. The number after the L is the points scored by Denver.\n\nI'll go through each row and identify where the result starts with an 'L' (indicating a loss) and note the points scored in those games:\n\n1. Week 3: Result L 14-38 \u2192 Broncos scored 14\n2. Week 4: Result L 9-20 \u2192 Broncos scored 9\n3. Week 6: Result L 13-26 \u2192 Broncos scored 13\n4. Week 7: Result L 17-42 \u2192 Broncos scored 17\n5. Week 8: Result L 16-17 \u2192 Broncos scored 16\n6. Week 10: Result L 21-35 \u2192 Broncos scored 21\n7. Week 12: Result L 10-17 \u2192 Broncos scored 10\n8. Week 14: Result L 13-14 \u2192 Broncos scored 13\n\nLooking at these, the highest points in a loss is 21 from week 10 against the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nThe claim says the most points was 15, but according to this, it's actually 21. Therefore, the claim is false because there's a game where Denver scored more than 15 points in a loss.\n\nI should also verify if I missed any rows or misread the scores. Scanning again, all losses are accounted for and the highest score in a loss is indeed 21, which contradicts the claim of 15.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the most points Denver Broncos scored in a loss during 1975 was 15.

However, given the opponents and team names (like Cleveland Browns, Green Bay Packers), it seems plausible that this is a 1975 season since teams like the Denver Broncos were active then.\n\nNext, I'll look for any games that went into overtime. Scanning through each row's \"result\" column:\n\n- Row 1: W 37-33 - no overtime mentioned.\n- Row 2: W 23-13 - standard result.\n- Row 3: L 14-38 - no OT.\n- Row 4: L 9-20 - regular game.\n- Row 5: W 16-15 - this seems close, but no indication of OT. Wait, actually, looking again, it's listed as a regular result without an overtime notation.\n- Row 6: L 13-26 - no OT.\n- Row 7: L 17-42 - standard game.\n- Row 8: L 16-17 - close, but not OT.\n- Row 9: W 27-17 - regular.\n- Row 10: L 21-35 - no OT.\n- Row 11: W 13-10 (OT) - here's one overtime game.\n- Row 12: L 10-17 - standard.\n- Row 13: W 25-10 - regular.\n- Row 14: L 13-14 - no OT.\n\nSo, only in Row 11 is there an overtime result. The claim says they went into overtime twice, but according to this table, it's only once. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cell is Row 11 under \"result\" where the game was decided in overtime.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"In 1975, the Denver Broncos finish the season with a win at the Miami Orange Bowl\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure and the data it contains. The table has rows representing each week of the season, with details like the date, opponent, result, game site, record, etc. \n\nThe claim mentions two key points: the year 1975 and a win against Miami at the Miami Orange Bowl to finish the season.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that all dates are in September through December, but there's no explicit mention of the year anywhere. Since the user is referring to 1975, I have to assume this data pertains to that year unless stated otherwise. However, without a specific year listed in the table, it could be any season.\n\nNext, let me check if there's a game against Miami at the Miami Orange Bowl. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 14 mentions an opponent as Miami Dolphins and the game site as Miami Orange Bowl on December 20 with a result of L 13 - 14 (a loss). So, the Broncos lost that game.\n\nWait, but the claim says they finished the season with a win. Since row 14 is presumably the last week of the season (week 14), and it's a loss, that would mean they ended with a loss, not a win.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Denver finished the season with a win at Miami Orange Bowl is false because the result was a loss.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are from row 14 where the opponent is Miami Dolphins, game site is Miami Orange Bowl, and the result is L (loss).\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
