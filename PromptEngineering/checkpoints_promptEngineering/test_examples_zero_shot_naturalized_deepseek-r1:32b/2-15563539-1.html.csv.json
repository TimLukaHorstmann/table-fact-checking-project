This matches the second part of the claim.\n- John H Vandenbosch is listed as the Socialist ticket candidate for Treasurer, which aligns with the first part of the claim.\n\nBoth parts of the claim are accurate based on the information in Row 6.

I need to determine if the claim \"george r lunn be on the democratic ticket along with franklin p brill on the worker 's ticket\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table to understand its structure. Each row represents a different office position, and each column lists the candidates from various parties for that office. The columns are: office, democratic ticket, republican ticket, socialist ticket, workers ticket.\n\nThe claim has two parts:\n1. George R Lunn is on the Democratic ticket.\n2.

So, the first part of the claim is correct.\n- The workers ticket is Franklin P Brill. This matches the second part of the claim.\n\nBoth parts are supported by the data in rows 2 under their respective columns. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI need to note the relevant cells:\n- For George R Lunn: row index 1 (since rows start at 0), column \"democratic ticket\".\n- For Franklin P Brill: same row index 1, column \"workers ticket\".\n\nSo, both candidates are correctly listed in their respective tickets for the Lieutenant Governor office.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"democratic ticket\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"workers ticket\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The table has seven rows, each representing a different office and listing candidates from various tickets: Democratic, Republican, Socialist, and Workers.\n\nThe claim mentions two individuals: Alfred E. Smith and James P. Cannon. It states that both are on their respective party's tickets. So I need to check if Alfred E. Smith is indeed on the Democratic ticket and if James P. Cannon is on the Worker's ticket.\n\nLooking at Row 1, which corresponds to the office of Governor:\n- The Democratic ticket candidate is listed as Alfred E. Smith.\n- The Workers ticket candidate here is James P. Cannon. \n\nSo, both individuals are in the same row under different tickets. This directly supports the claim that each is on their respective party's ticket.\n\nI don't need to look at other rows because the claim only pertains to these two candidates for Governor and State Engineer or whatever office they're running for. Wait, no\u2014actually, checking again, Row 1 is Governor, and James P. Cannon is under Workers ticket there.

The claim states: \"lieutenant governor be the office when the republican ticket do not show seymour lowman.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It seems a bit grammatically off, but I think it's saying that the Republican ticket for the office of Lieutenant Governor does not have Seymour Lowman.\n\nLooking at the table, there are seven rows, each representing different offices and their respective tickets from various parties. The relevant columns here are \"office\" and \"republican ticket\".\n\nI'll check each row to see where the office is \"lieutenant governor\". From Row 2: office is lieutenant governor, and under the Republican ticket, it's Seymour Lowman.\n\nThe claim suggests that for the Lieutenant Governor position, the Republican ticket does not have Seymour Lowman. But according to the table, the Republican ticket for Lieutenant Governor is indeed Seymour Lowman. Therefore, the claim is false because it contradicts the information in the table.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cell is row 2 under \"republican ticket\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the Republican ticket for Lieutenant Governor does include Seymour Lowman as per the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"republican ticket\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"carl sherman be the name on the democratic ticket when the socialist ticket be norman thomas.\" Hmm, that phrasing is a bit awkward, but I think it means that Carl Sherman is on the Democratic ticket in the same row where Norman Thomas is on the Socialist ticket.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- Row 1: Office is governor. The Democratic ticket is Alfred E Smith, and the Socialist ticket is Norman Thomas.\n- So, in this row, under 'democratic ticket', we have Alfred E Smith, not Carl Sherman. Therefore, in the row where the socialist ticket is Norman Thomas, the democratic ticket isn't Carl Sherman.\n\nNow, checking other rows to see if there's any other occurrence where the Socialist ticket is Norman Thomas and the Democratic ticket is Carl Sherman. \n\nLooking at Row 5: Office is attorney general. The Democratic ticket here is Carl Sherman, but the Socialist ticket is Louis Waldman, not Norman Thomas.\n\nSo, in no row does the Socialist ticket have Norman Thomas while the Democratic ticket has Carl Sherman. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Carl Sherman is on the Democratic ticket when the Socialist ticket is Norman Thomas.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. The user has provided a table with several rows and columns, each listing candidates for various offices under different party tickets. The claim to verify is: \"john h vandenbosch be the name of the socialist ticket when george kshuler be on the democratic ticket for governor.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim correctly. It seems there are two main parts here:\n\n1. Identify if John H Vandenbosch is indeed the Socialist ticket candidate.\n2. Check if George K Shuler is running for Governor under the Democratic ticket.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\n- For the Governor's office (Row 1), the Democratic ticket is Alfred E Smith, Republican is Theodore Roosevelt Jr., etc. So, George K Shuler isn't listed here as a candidate for Governor.\n  \nWait, that might be a mistake because in Row 6 (Treasurer), the Democratic ticket is George K Shuler. But he's running for Treasurer, not Governor.\n\nNext, checking the Socialist tickets across all offices:\n\n- In Row 1 (Governor), the Socialist ticket is Norman Thomas.\n- In Row 2 (Lieutenant Governor), it's Charles Solomon.\n- In Row 3 (Secretary of State), Frank R Crosswaith.\n- In Row 4 (Comptroller), Theresa B Wiley.\n- In Row 5 (Attorney General), Louis Waldman.\n- In Row 6 (Treasurer), John H Vandenbosch.\n- In Row 7 (State Engineer), Vladimir Karapetoff.\n\nSo, John H Vandenbosch is indeed the Socialist ticket candidate for Treasurer, not Governor. The claim states that he's the Socialist ticket when George K Shuler is on the Democratic ticket for Governor. But since George isn't running for Governor but rather Treasurer, and John is also in Treasurer, they're both in different offices.\n\nTherefore, the claim connects these two incorrectly because their respective positions don't align as stated. The relevant cells are Row 1 (Governor's democratic ticket) and Row 6 (Treasurer's socialist ticket). Since George isn't a Governor candidate and John is in Treasurer, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"democratic ticket\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"socialist ticket\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"james p cannon be the name on the democratic ticket when the worker ticket be alfred e smith.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse this claim correctly. It seems like it's saying that if the worker ticket has Alfred E Smith, then the Democratic ticket should have James P Cannon. Alternatively, maybe it's asking whether James P Cannon is on the Democratic ticket in the same row where the Workers ticket is Alfred E Smith.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 1: Office - Governor\nDemocratic ticket: Alfred E Smith\nRepublican: Theodore Roosevelt Jr.\nSocialist: Norman Thomas\nWorkers: James P Cannon\n\nSo in Row 1, the Workers ticket is James P Cannon. The Democratic ticket here is Alfred E Smith. But the claim seems to be about a situation where the Workers ticket is Alfred E Smith and checking if the Democratic ticket has James P Cannon.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the claim. It says \"james p cannon be the name on the democratic ticket when the worker ticket be alfred e smith.\" So it's conditional: When the worker ticket is Alfred E Smith, does the Democratic ticket have James P Cannon?\n\nBut in Row 1, the Workers ticket is James P Cannon, not Alfred E Smith. So we need to check if there's any row where the Worker ticket is Alfred E Smith and see what the Democratic ticket is.\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\nRow 2: Workers ticket - Franklin P Brill\nRow 3: Lilly Lore\nRow 4: Abraham Epstein\nRow 5: Arthur S Leeds\nRow 6: Edward Lindgren\nRow 7: Richard J Verhagen\n\nNone of these are Alfred E Smith. In Row 1, the Workers ticket is James P Cannon, and the Democratic ticket is Alfred E Smith.\n\nSo there's no row where the Worker ticket is Alfred E Smith; instead, Alfred E Smith is on the Democratic ticket in Row 1, while the Workers ticket has James P Cannon. Therefore, the claim seems to be false because the condition (Worker ticket being Alfred E Smith) isn't met anywhere, and thus James P Cannon can't be on the Democratic ticket under that condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misunderstood the claim's structure. Perhaps it's stating both conditions: the worker ticket is Alfred E Smith and the democratic ticket is James P Cannon in the same row. But since no such row exists where Worker is Alfred E Smith, the claim isn't supported by any data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that when the Workers ticket is Alfred E Smith, the Democratic ticket should be James P Cannon. Checking each row:\n\n- In Row 1: Workers ticket is James P Cannon, so this doesn't meet the condition of the Workers ticket being Alfred E Smith.\n\nNo rows have Alfred E Smith on the Workers ticket. Therefore, the claim cannot be supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"workers ticket\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
