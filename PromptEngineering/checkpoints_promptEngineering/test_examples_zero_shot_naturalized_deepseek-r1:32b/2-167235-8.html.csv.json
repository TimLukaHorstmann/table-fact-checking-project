Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll locate the relevant rows in the table for both Bashkim Fino and Vilson Ahmeti. Looking through the table:\n\n- Row 6 has Bashkim Fino with a term start of 11 March 1997.\n- Row 4 has Vilson Ahmeti with a term start of 10 December 1991.\n\nNow, comparing the term start dates: 10 December 1991 comes before 11 March 1997. So, Bashkim Fino started his term after Vilson Ahmeti. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nTo make sure I'm thorough, I'll check if there are any other relevant cells or details that might affect this conclusion. Both rows only have their respective term start dates, which are clear and unambiguous. There's no overlap or ambiguity in these dates as they're both from different years entirely.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Bashkim Fino's term started after Vilson Ahmeti's. Checking their respective rows:\n\n- Vilson Ahmeti: Term Start - 10 December 1991\n- Bashkim Fino: Term Start - 11 March 1997\n\nSince 1997 is after 1991, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"term start\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"term start\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

There are four people mentioned: Ilir Meta, Bashkim Fino, Ylli Bufi, and Pandeli Majko (1st time).

His political party is also listed as \"socialist party of albania.\" That matches too.\n\n- **Row 3**: Name is Ylli Bufi. His political party is again \"socialist party of albania.\" So that's correct.\n\n- **Row 8**: Name is Pandeli Majko (1st time).

The task is to determine whether the claim \"the term end for vilson ahmeti be after the term end for ylli bufi\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll need to identify which rows in the table correspond to Vilson Ahmeti and Ylli Bufi. Looking at the table:\n\n- Row 4 has the name \"vilson ahmeti\". His term end is listed as 13 April 1992.\n- Row 3 has the name \"ylli bufi\". His term end is on 10 December 1991.\n\nNow, comparing their term end dates:\n- Vilson Ahmeti ended his term on April 13, 1992.\n- Ylli Bufi ended his term earlier, on December 10, 1991.\n\nSince April comes after December in the same year (assuming both years are 1992), this means that Vilson Ahmeti's term end is indeed after Ylli Bufi's. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nTo support this conclusion, I'll note the relevant cells from the table:\n- For Vilson Ahmeti, row index 4 (assuming rows start at 0) and column \"term end\".\n- For Ylli Bufi, row index 3 and column \"term end\".\n\nThis gives us two relevant cells that directly support the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"term end\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"term end\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"sali berisha be the first person since aleksand\u00ebr meksi , to be elect as a member of the democratic party of albania political party.\" \n\nFirst, I should parse what this means. It's stating that Sali Berisha was elected as a Prime Minister from the Democratic Party of Albania and that he is the first person to do so since Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to identify all instances where a Prime Minister was part of the Democratic Party of Albania. Let's go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Header\n- Row 2: Fatos Nano (PLA)\n- Row 3: Ylli Bufi (SPA)\n- Row 4: Vilson Ahmeti (non-party)\n- Row 5: Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi (DP A) - term start April 92 to March 97\n- Row 6: Bashkim Fino (SPA)\n- Row 7: Fatos Nano (SPA)\n- Row 8: Pandeli Majko (SPA)\n- Row 9: Ilir Meta (SPA)\n- Row 10: Pandeli Majko (SPA)\n- Row 11: Fatos Nano (SPA)\n- Row 12: Sali Berisha (DP A) - term start September 2005 to September 2013\n- Row 13: Edi Rama (SPA)\n\nSo, the only two Prime Ministers from the Democratic Party of Albania are Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi and Sali Berisha. Between their terms, there's a gap from when Meksi ended in March 97 to when Berisha started in September 2005.\n\nThe claim says that Sali Berisha is the first person since Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi elected as a member of DP A. From the table, after Meksi's term ended in 1997, the next Prime Minister from DP A was indeed Berisha starting in 2005.

Let me start by understanding the claim: \"only 1 person have be a member of the party of labour of albania political party and be elect.\" So, the claim states that only one person has been both a member of the Party of Labour of Albania (PLA) and elected as a prime minister.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a prime minister from 1991 onwards. The columns include name, birth-death years, term start, term end, and political party.\n\nI'll go through each row to check who was part of the PLA. Starting with Row 2: Fatos Nano (1st time) is listed under the Party of Labour of Albania. His term started on February 22, 1991, and ended on June 5, 1991. So he's one person from PLA.\n\nNext, I'll check other rows to see if anyone else was part of PLA. Rows 3 to 13 show different political parties: Socialist Party of Albania, Non-Party, Democratic Party of Albania, etc. None of these mention the Party of Labour of Albania except Row 2.\n\nSo, only Fatos Nano (1st time) is associated with PLA as a prime minister.

It's comparing the start dates of two prime ministers: Ylli Bufi and Vilson Ahmeti. The claim states that Ylli Bufi started his term after Vilson Ahmeti did.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different prime minister with details like name, born-died, term start, term end, and political party. I need to find the relevant rows for both Ylli Bufi and Vilson Ahmeti.\n\nStarting with Ylli Bufi: From the table, Row 3 has his information. His term started on 5 June 1991.\n\nNext, looking for Vilson Ahmeti: He's in Row 4. His term started on 10 December 1991.\n\nNow, comparing their term start dates. Ylli Bufi started on 5 June, and Vilson Ahmeti started later on 10 December of the same year. Since June comes before December, Ylli Bufi's term actually started earlier than Vilson Ahmeti's.\n\nWait, but the claim says that Ylli Bufi's term start is after Vilson Ahmeti's. That would mean Ylli's start date should be later in time than Vilson's. However, according to the table, Ylli's term began in June 1991, and Vilson's started in December 1991. So Ylli started before Vilson.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because Ylli Bufi's term actually started earlier, not after.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are from Rows 3 (Ylli Bufi) and Row 4 (Vilson Ahmeti), specifically their \"term start\" dates.

The claim says: \"ilir meta be the first person since aleksand\u00ebr meksi, to be elect as a member of the democratic party of albania political party.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It seems to say that Ilir Meta was the first person after Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi to be elected from the Democratic Party of Albania (DP). So, I'm looking for two things: when Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi served and whether anyone from his party held office between his term end and Ilir Meta's term start.\n\nLooking at the table, let me find the relevant rows. Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi is in row 5. His term started on April 13, 1992, and ended on March 11, 1997, under the Democratic Party of Albania (DP). Now, after that, I need to check if anyone from DP was elected again before Ilir Meta.\n\nIlir Meta is in row 9. His term started on October 29, 1999, and ended on February 22, 2002, with the Socialist Party of Albania (SP). Wait, so he's not from DP; that's important. The claim says Ilir was elected as a member of DP, but according to the table, he's part of SP. That could be an issue.\n\nWait, let me check other rows after Meksi. After March 1997, Bashkim Fino (row 6) took over from March 11, 1997, to July 24, 1997, under SP. Then Fatos Nano (row 7) was next, also with SP, then Pandeli Majko twice (rows 8 and 10), both SP, and Ilir Meta again SP in row 9.\n\nLooking at DP after Meksi, the next person from DP is Sali Berisha in row 12. His term started on September 11, 2005, which is way later than Ilir Meta's term. So between March 1997 and 2005, all prime ministers were from SP except for Vilson Ahmeti (row 4) who was non-party.\n\nSo the claim says Ilir Meta was the first since Meksi in DP, but according to the table, Ilir is actually with SP. The next DP prime minister after Meksi was Sali Berisha in 2005. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it attributes DP membership to Ilir Meta when he's from SP and also because the first DP member after Meksi was Berisha, not Meta.\n\nSo, checking all relevant cells: rows for Meksi (row 5), Ilir Meta (row 9) with their political parties. Also, Sali Berisha (row 12) to see when the next DP PM was.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Ilir Meta was not a member of the Democratic Party; he was from the Socialist Party. The next DP leader after Meksi was Berisha in 2005.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
