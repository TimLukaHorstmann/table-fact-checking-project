    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"rene lambert play right wing and be draft with the 146th pick\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n1. Rene Lambert plays as a right wing.\n2. He was drafted with the 146th pick.\n\nI'll check each part against the table.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- Row 3: It mentions \"rene lambert\" as the player. His position is listed as \"right wing,\" which matches the first part of the claim. So that's a confirmation for point 1.\n  \nNext, checking the pick number. The same row (Row 3) shows his pick number as 146. That directly corresponds to the second part of the claim.\n\nSo both parts are verified in Row 3. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I'll note that from Row 3, the \"player\" column confirms it's Rene Lambert, and the \"position\" and \"pick\" columns confirm his role and draft pick number.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"right wing, rene lampert, be pick 145th\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components:\n- Position: right wing\n- Player name: Rene Lampert\n- Pick number: 145\n\nNow, I'll go through each row of the table to find any matches.\n\nLooking at Row 3:\n- Pick: 146\n- Player: Rene Lambert (note the spelling difference: \"Lambert\" vs. \"lampert\")\n- Position: right wing\n- NHL Team: New York Islanders\n\nComparing this with the claim, the position matches (right wing), but there's a discrepancy in the player's last name\u2014Lambert vs. lampert. This might be a typo, so I'll consider it as a possible match.\n\nNext, checking the pick number. The claim states 145th, but Rene Lambert is picked at 146. That doesn't align.\n\nLooking through other rows:\n- Row 2: Pick 145, Steve Lyon, position defence. Doesn't fit.\n- Rows 4 to 8 don't have the right wing or match the player name.\n\nSo, even though there's a similarity in the player's first name and position, the pick number doesn't match. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies that Rene Lampert was picked 145th as a right wing. However, from Row 3 of the table, we see that Rene Lambert (note the spelling) was picked at 146, not 145. The correct pick for position and player doesn't match the stated pick number.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
