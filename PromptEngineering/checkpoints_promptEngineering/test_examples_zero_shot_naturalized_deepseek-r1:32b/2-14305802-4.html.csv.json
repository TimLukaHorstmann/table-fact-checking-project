    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the philadelphia flyer lose the 22nd game of the 1977-78 season to the los angeles king.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It mentions a specific game number (22nd) against a specific opponent (Los Angeles Kings) and claims that Philadelphia lost this game.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like game number, date, opponent, score, record, and points. The rows are numbered from 1 to 35, but the claim refers to game 22. Wait, checking the first few rows:\n\nRow 1 is Game 22 on December 1 against Los Angeles Kings.\n\nWait a second, in the table, Row 1 corresponds to Game 22? That seems odd because usually, games are numbered sequentially. Let me check again.\n\nThe table starts with Game 22 as Row 1. So each subsequent row increases the game number by one. Therefore, the first game listed is indeed Game 22.\n\nSo for Game 22, opponent is Los Angeles Kings, and score is 4-2 in favor of Philadelphia because the home team (Philadelphia Flyers) would be first? Wait, no\u2014actually, looking at the 'score' column: it's written as 4 - 2. Typically, the home team is listed first or it might depend on who is playing where. But since the opponent is Los Angeles Kings, and the score is 4-2, I need to figure out if Philadelphia won or lost.\n\nAssuming the format is Team1 Score - Team2 Score. If the table's 'opponent' column lists the opposing team, then the first number in the score would be Philadelphia's points. So a 4-2 score means Philadelphia scored 4, and Los Angeles scored 2. Therefore, Philadelphia won this game.\n\nBut the claim says \"lose,\" so if they actually lost, the answer would be FALSE. However, based on the table, Philadelphia won Game 22 against Los Angeles Kings with a score of 4-2. Hence, the claim that they lost is incorrect.\n\nSo the relevant cell is Row 1 (Game 22) and 'score' column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Philadelphia lost game 22 to Los Angeles. The table shows a win for Philadelphia in game 22 with a score of 4-2. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the 1977-78 philadelphia flyer lose by 5 points to the boston bruin\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. Each row represents a game played in December, with details like the game number, date, opponent, score, record, and points. The team in question here is the Philadelphia Flyers, so I need to check each row where the opponent is the Boston Bruins because the claim mentions that they lost to them.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Row 7: Opponent is Boston Bruins. Score is 6-4 in favor of the Flyers? Wait, no\u2014wait, let me double-check. The score format is \"Flyers - Opponent\", right? So in row 7, it's 6-4, which means Flyers scored 6 and Boston scored 4. That would be a win for Philadelphia, not a loss.\n\nThen there's another game against the Bruins in Row 12: opponent is Boston Bruins again. The score here is 1-6. So this time, the Flyers scored 1 and Boston scored 6. That means the Flyers lost by 5 points (since 6-1=5). \n\nNow, checking the record and points for that game: Before this game in Row 12, their record was 22-6-4 with 48 points. After losing, it's still 22-6-4 but points remain at 48? Wait, no\u2014looking back, actually, after Game 32 (Row 12), the record is 22-6-4 and points are 48. So their point total didn't increase because they lost.\n\nSo in this case, the Flyers did lose to the Bruins by a score of 1-6, which is a difference of 5 points. The game took place on December 23rd (since row 12 is december:23). \n\nTherefore, the claim that the Philadelphia Flyers lost by 5 points to the Boston Bruins in the 1977-78 season is TRUE. The relevant cell for this is Row 12, where the opponent is Boston Bruins and the score reflects a loss by 5 points.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the 1977-78 philadelphia flyer win the 24th and 25th game of the season against the new york ranger.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse the claim carefully. It's about the Philadelphia Flyers in the 1977-78 season. They supposedly won both their 24th and 25th games against the New York Rangers.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a game with details like game number, date, opponent, score, record, and points. The team's name isn't explicitly stated in the table, but based on context, it seems to be about a specific team since all opponents are listed as different teams, which suggests that this is the schedule of one particular team\u2014probably the Philadelphia Flyers, given the claim.\n\nSo, I need to check two things:\n1. For game 24 and game 25, whether they were against the New York Rangers.\n2. Whether the team won both games (i.e., if their score was higher than the opponent's in those games).\n\nLet me go through each relevant row step by step.\n\nStarting with Game 24: Looking at the table, I see that Row 3 corresponds to game 24. The opponent is New York Rangers. The score is listed as 3-3. So it was a tie, not a win. Therefore, the Flyers didn't win this game; they tied.\n\nNext, Game 25: That's in Row 4. The opponent again is New York Rangers. The score here is 7-4. Since 7 is higher than 4, the team won this game.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n- Game 24 against NYR ended in a tie (3-3).\n- Game 25 against NYR was a win (7-4).\n\nThe claim states that they won both games, but according to the table, they only won the 25th game and tied the 24th. Therefore, the claim is not fully supported by the data.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n- For Game 24: Row 3, columns are game number (game: 24), opponent (New York Rangers), score (3-3).\n- For Game 25: Row 4, same columns but score is 7-4.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would include both rows where these games occurred, specifically checking the game numbers and scores against the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both games 24 and 25 were wins. However, in game 24 (Row 3), they tied, so it's a loss for the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"the cleveland baron score no point against the 1977 - 78 philadelphia flyer on december 21st\". \n\nFirst, I should look for any game that occurred on December 21st involving the Cleveland Barons. Scanning through the table rows:\n\n- Row 10: Game 31 is on December 21. The opponent is the Cleveland Barons.\n\nNow, checking the score for this game. The score is listed as 4 - 0. Since the Flyers are the home team (assuming they're playing against the Barons), a 4-0 score means the Flyers won and the Barons didn't score any points. So, in terms of points, the Barons have 0 here.\n\nBut wait, looking at the 'points' column for this row: it's 48. That's the team's total points up to that game, not just from that single game. Each win gives 2 points, a loss gives 0, and an overtime or shootout loss gives 1 point. \n\nSo in Game 31 (December 21), the Flyers scored 4 goals against the Barons who scored none. Therefore, the Barons didn't earn any points from this game because they lost. Their record before this game was 22-5-4 and after, it's 22-6-4? Wait, no: looking back, row 10 shows the record as 22-5-4 with 48 points. Row 9 had 21-4-4, then row 10 is game 31 on Dec 21, opponent Barons, score 4-0, so they lost. So their record becomes 22-6-4? Wait no, in the table, after this game (row 10), the record is 22-5-4 because before it was 21-4-4, and then a loss would make it 22 losses? No, wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, row 9: Game 30 on Dec 18 vs Canadiens. They lost 0-2, so record becomes 21-5-4 (since before that in row 9, the record is 21-5-4 with points 46). Then game 31 on Dec 21: opponent Barons, score 4-0. So they won because their goals are first? Wait no, wait the team's own goals are first? Or is it opponent vs team?\n\nWait in row 10, the opponent is Cleveland Barons, and the score is 4 - 0. If the Flyers are the home team, then the score would be Flyers' goals first. So 4-0 means Flyers won 4-0 against the Barons.\n\nSo for the Barons, they lost this game, so they didn't get any points from it. Their previous record before this game (game 31) isn't shown here; perhaps in another row, but in our table, each row represents a different team's perspective? Wait no, I think all these rows are from the Philadelphia Flyers' perspective because each row lists their opponent and score as if they're playing at home.\n\nWait, actually, looking back: Each row seems to represent a game for the same team, likely the Philadelphia Flyers. Because the opponents vary, and the record increments with wins or losses.\n\nSo in row 10 (game 31), the opponent is Cleveland Barons, score is 4-0, so the Flyers won, gaining 2 points (from 46 to 48). The Barons, on the other hand, would have lost this game. Therefore, they didn't earn any points from this match.\n\nSo the claim is that the Cleveland Barons scored no points against the Flyers on Dec 21st. That's correct because they lost and thus earned 0 points from that game.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Cleveland Barons did not score any points against the Philadelphia Flyers on December 21, 1977-78. From the table, Game 31 (row 10) shows a 4-0 win for the Flyers, meaning the Barons lost and received no points from this game.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Game:** Look for December 21st in the table.\n   - Found in Row 10: December 21, opponent Cleveland Barons.\n\n2. **Check Score:** The score is listed as 4-0 (Flyers win).\n   - This means the Barons scored 0 goals and lost the game.\n\n3. **Determine Points for Barons:** Since they lost, they received 0 points from this game.\n   - Their previous record isn't in focus; we only need to confirm if they earned any points on Dec 21.\n\n**Conclusion:** The Cleveland Barons indeed scored no points against the Flyers on December 21. They lost the game and thus didn't earn any points from it.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"opponent\": \"Cleveland Barons\",\n  \"date\": \"December 21\",\n  \"score\": \"4-0\",\n  \"points_earned_by_opponent\": 0,\n  \"result\": \"Flyers win\"\n}\n```\n\n**Answer:** Yes, the Cleveland Barons did not score any points against the Philadelphia Flyers on December 21, 1977-78. They lost the game with a score of 4-0 in favor of the Flyers.\n\n\\boxed{0}",

The goal is to determine if the claim \"the 1977-78 philadelphia flyer win by 3 points against the minnesota north star\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means and find corresponding data in the table.\n\n1. **Identifying Relevant Information:**\n   - The team involved: Philadelphia Flyers.\n   - The opponent: Minnesota North Stars.\n   - The season: 1977-78 (though the table doesn't specify seasons, so I'll assume this is relevant based on context).\n   - Outcome of the game: Win by a margin of 3 points.\n\n2. **Checking for Philadelphia Flyers' Games:**\n   Looking through each row in the table to find games where the opponent was the Minnesota North Stars and check if it's a win with a 3-point difference.\n\n3. **Reviewing Each Row:**\n   - Row 14: Opponent is St. Louis Blues, so not relevant.\n   - Row 13: Opponent is Minnesota North Stars.

I need to determine whether the claim \"the philadelphia flyer lose the 22nd game of the 1977-78 season to the colorado rockies\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim is stating:\n\n1. The team in question is the Philadelphia Flyers.\n2. They lost a specific game: the 22nd game of the 1977-78 season.\n3. Their opponent in that game was the Colorado Rockies.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that each row represents a game with details such as the game number, date, opponent, score, record, and points. The team whose games are being listed isn't explicitly mentioned in the table, but since the claim is about the Philadelphia Flyers, I'll assume this table pertains to their season.\n\nNow, let's break down the elements needed from the table:\n\n- **Game Number 22**: I need to find the row where \"game\" equals 22. Scanning through the rows, Row 1 has game number 22.\n  \n- **Opponent**: For that specific game (Row 1), the opponent is listed as \"los angeles kings\". The claim mentions the Colorado Rockies, which doesn't match.\n\n- **Outcome (Win/Loss)**: The score for Game 22 is 4 - 2. Since the Flyers are the team in question and they scored 4 points compared to Los Angeles' 2, this indicates a win, not a loss. However, if the claim refers to another game against Colorado Rockies, I need to check if there's such an entry.\n\nLooking further, Row 2 has opponent \"colorado rockies\". Here, the score is 6 - 3, which again shows a win for the Flyers (since they scored more points). The record after this game improves from 15-4-3 to 16-4-3, indicating another win.\n\nSince Game 22 was against Los Angeles and ended in a win, and their next game (Game 23) against Colorado also resulted in a win, the claim that they lost the 22nd game to Colorado is incorrect on two counts: the opponent for game 22 wasn't Colorado, and even when they did play Colorado in Game 23, it was a win.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"the cleveland baron score the most point against the 1977 - 78 philadelphia flyer on december 21st\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim:\n\n1. **Team Involved**: Cleveland Barons\n2. **Event Date**: December 21st\n3. **Opponent**: Philadelphia Flyers (1977-78 season)\n4. **Claim Statement**: They scored the most points against that opponent on that date.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for any rows where the opponent is Cleveland Barons and the date is December 21st. \n\nI scan through each row:\n\n- Row 10: Game 31, December 21, Opponent Cleveland Barons\n  - The score here is 4-0 in favor of Philadelphia Flyers (since the record increases from 21 to 22 wins).\n  - Points for that game are 48.\n\nNow, I need to check if this was the highest points scored by any team against the Flyers on December 21st. \n\nLooking through all rows with opponent Cleveland Barons:\n\n- There's only one such row (Row 10). So, in this case, Philadelphia scored 4 points against Cleveland on December 21st.\n\nIs there another game where a different team might have scored more points against the Flyers on that date? From the table, it seems Row 10 is the only game on December 21st. \n\nTherefore, since there's no other data for December 21st against Cleveland Barons, we can't compare to other teams' scores. But if the claim is about Cleveland scoring the most points in that particular game, then their score was 4-0, meaning they scored 0 points (as they lost). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no\u2014points are calculated as wins*2 + ties. So for each game, both teams have points. In Row 10, the Flyers won 4-0, so their points increased by 2 (from 46 to 48). Cleveland's record wasn't provided here, but in this table, it's about the Flyers' performance.\n\nWait a second\u2014maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim is that Cleveland scored the most points against Philadelphia on December 21st. But according to Row 10, the score was 4-0 in favor of Philadelphia. So Cleveland scored 0 goals in that game. That would mean they didn't score any points in terms of goals. \n\nBut perhaps I'm misinterpreting \"points.\" In hockey, a team gets two points for a win, one for an overtime loss, etc. But the column here is \"points,\" which seems to be cumulative throughout the season.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nIn Row 10: score is 4-0 (Flyers won). So Philadelphia Flyers scored 4 goals, and Cleveland Barons scored 0. The claim says Cleveland scored the most points against the Flyers on that date. But if they scored 0 goals, that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"points\" in the table refer to something else, but looking at the column headers, it's just labeled as \"points,\" which is a bit ambiguous. However, given the values (e.g., points increasing each game), it likely represents the team's total points in the season, not the goals scored in that specific game.\n\nWait, that might be confusing. Let me think again.\n\nThe claim is about the Cleveland Barons scoring the most points against Philadelphia on December 21st. In hockey terms, \"points\" can refer to either the team's overall league standing (which includes wins, losses, ties) or the actual goals scored in a game.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"score,\" which is the game score. So for example, Row 10: score is 4-0, meaning Philadelphia won 4-0 against Cleveland. Therefore, Cleveland Barons scored 0 points (goals) in that game against Philadelphia on December 21st.\n\nSo the claim says they scored the most points against Philadelphia on that date, but according to this, they scored zero. Unless there's another game where a different team scored more against Philadelphia on Dec 21, which doesn't seem to be the case because Row 10 is the only entry for December 21st.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Perhaps it's about the Flyers' points against Cleveland Barons being the most they've earned that season? But no, the claim specifies Cleveland scoring the most points against Philadelphia.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider if there are other games on Dec 21 where different opponents played against the Flyers and scored more points than Cleveland did. But looking at the table, only Row 10 is on December 21st, so it's just that one game.\n\nTherefore, in that single game, Cleveland scored zero points (goals) against Philadelphia. So they didn't score the most; in fact, they scored nothing. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because Cleveland Barons didn't score any points against Philadelphia on that date, let alone the most.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting \"points\" as in goals versus season points. Let me check:\n\nIn hockey, a team earns 2 points for a win, 1 for an overtime loss, and 0 for a regulation loss. The \"points\" column here seems to be cumulative throughout the season. For example, Row 9: points 46; Row 10: 48 after winning. So in that context, \"points\" are about the team's league standings, not the goals scored.\n\nSo when the claim says Cleveland Barons scored the most points against Philadelphia on Dec 21st, it might mean they earned more points (in terms of wins/losses) than any other opponent did against Philadelphia that day. But since there was only one game on Dec 21st, and Cleveland lost, earning zero points from that game. Therefore, they didn't score the most; actually, they scored nothing in terms of points.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because they didn't earn any points (they lost), so they didn't score the most against Philadelphia on that date.\n\nAlternatively, if \"points\" refers to goals, then Cleveland scored zero in that game. Therefore, again, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Cleveland Barons scored the most points against the Philadelphia Flyers on December 21st. Based on the table:\n\n- On December 21st (Row 10), the score was 4-0 in favor of the Philadelphia Flyers, meaning Cleveland scored 0 goals and lost the game.\n- The term \"points\" likely refers to cumulative league points, where a win earns 2 points. Since Cleveland lost, they earned 0 points from this game.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Cleveland did not score any points (goals or league points) against Philadelphia on that date. They scored zero goals and lost the game, so they couldn't have scored the most points.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false.",

So the Flyers won this game by 2 points.\n- Row 12: Game 32 on December 23, opponent is Boston Bruins again, score is 1-6. This time, the Bruins won with a 5-point difference.\n\nThe claim says they lost by 3 points. In the two games against Boston, one was a Flyers win (by 2) and the other a loss (by 5). Neither of these matches a loss by exactly 3 points. \n\nAdditionally, looking at the scores, there's no instance where the Flyers lost to Boston with a 3-point margin in the given data.\n\nTherefore, based on the table provided, the claim is not supported because there are no games where the Flyers lost by exactly 3 points against the Bruins.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Philadelphia Flyers lost by 3 points to the Boston Bruins. Checking each relevant row:\n\n- **Row 7**: Score 6-4 (Flyers win).\n- **Row 12**: Score 1-6 (Flyers lose by 5).\n\nNo game shows a loss of exactly 3 points.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the 1977 - 78 philadelphia flyer win most of the game of the season against the new york ranger.\"\n\nFirst, I should check if the table has any information about the Philadelphia Flyers. Looking through each row, the opponent column shows teams like Los Angeles Kings, Colorado Rockies, New York Rangers, etc., but there's no mention of the Philadelphia Flyers as opponents. The team in question here is likely the Flyers, so perhaps they are the ones playing against these opponents.\n\nWait, actually, the claim mentions \"philadelphia flyer\" as a team, but in the table, the opponent column doesn't include them. So maybe the data provided isn't about the Flyers' games but another team's season. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo or misinterpretation. But since the claim is about the Flyers, and the table shows opponents like New York Rangers, I think the Flyers are the home team here.\n\nNext, the claim refers to games against the New York Rangers. Let me look at all rows where the opponent is \"new york rangers.\" That's Rows 3, 4, 12, and 13. Wait, checking each row:\n\nRow 3: Opponent NYR, score 3-3 (tie)\nRow 4: Opponent NYR, score 7-4 (Flyers win)\nRow 12: Opponent NYR, score 4-3 (Flyers win)\nWait, no. Wait, in the table provided, each row's opponent is listed, but I need to check if it's the Flyers' games against the Rangers.\n\nBut looking at Rows 3 and 4:\n\nRow 3: December 7, Opponent NYR, score 3-3 \u2192 tie\nRow 4: December 8, Opponent NYR, score 7-4 \u2192 win\n\nSo that's two games. But wait, Row 12 shows opponent NYR again on December 28, score 4-3 (win), and Row 13 is against the Minnesota North Stars.\n\nWait, actually in the table:\n\nRow 3: game 24 vs NYR \u2192 tie\nRow 4: game 25 vs NYR \u2192 win\nRow 12: game 33 vs NYR \u2192 I think the score was 4-3 (win)\nSo that's three games against NYR.\n\nWait, let me count:\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nRows with opponent \"new york rangers\":\n\nRow 3: Game 24, December 7\nRow 4: Game 25, December 8\nRow 12: Game 33, December 28\n\nSo three games against NYR.\n\nNow, checking the outcomes:\n\nRow 3: Score 3-3 \u2192 tie (so not a win)\nRow 4: 7-4 \u2192 Flyers win\nRow 12: 4-3 \u2192 Flyers win\n\nWait no, in Row 12, the score is 4-3. Wait, but I need to confirm which team scored what.\n\nLooking at each row's 'score' column:\n\nRow 3: 3 - 3 \u2192 tie\nRow 4: 7 - 4 \u2192 Flyers scored 7, opponent NYR scored 4 \u2192 win\nRow 12: 4 - 3 \u2192 Flyers scored 4, NYR scored 3 \u2192 win\n\nSo total games against NYR: 3\nWins: 2 (Rows 4 and 12)\nTie: 1 (Row 3)\n\nNow, the claim says \"win most of the game of the season against the new york ranger.\" So does winning two out of three count as winning most? Well, in a series, if there are three games, winning two would be more than half.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again:\n\nRow 3: December 7 vs NYR \u2192 tie\nRow 4: December 8 vs NYR \u2192 win\nRow 12: December 28 vs NYR \u2192 win\n\nSo three games in total against NYR, with two wins and one tie.\n\nNow, the claim says \"win most of the game.\" Since there are three games, two wins would be a majority. So yes, they won more than half their games against the Rangers.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that these are indeed all the games between them in the season. Are there any other rows where the opponent is NYR? Let me check all 14 rows:\n\nRow 3: NYR\nRow 4: NYR\nRow 12: NYR\n\nNo others. So three games total.\n\nSo, two wins and one tie. Therefore, they won most of their games against NYR in the season.\n\nWait, but wait a minute\u2014the table might represent just part of the season or only some games. But according to the data given, these are all the games against NYR.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe Philadelphia Flyers won two out of three games against the New York Rangers during the 1977-78 season as per the provided data, which constitutes winning most of their matchups against them.\n\nAnswer: Yes, the Philadelphia Flyers won most of their games against the New York Rangers during the 1977-78 season.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the 1977-78 philadelphia flyer win by 3 point against the boston bruin\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions a specific season (1977-78), a team (Philadelphia Flyers), and a game where they won by 3 points against the Boston Bruins. \n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a game played in December with details like game number, date, opponent, score, record, and points. The season isn't explicitly stated here, but given the context of the question, it's likely referring to this data as being from that season.\n\nNow, I need to find if there's any entry where Philadelphia Flyers played against Boston Bruins (opponent: boston bruins) and won by 3 points. Points in hockey are calculated based on wins, losses, and ties. A win typically gives 2 points, a tie gives 1 point, and a loss gives nothing.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Row 7: Game 28 vs Boston Bruins, score 6-4. The Flyers won this game. Their record after the game was 20-4-4, and their points were 44. Before this game (Row 6), they had 42 points. So after winning, they gained 2 points, making it 44. \n\nWait, the claim says \"win by 3 points.\" Hmm, in hockey, a win is usually 2 points, not 3. Maybe there's an overtime or something? Let me check other rows.\n\nLooking further down:\n\n- Row 12: Game 32 vs Boston Bruins again, score 1-6. The Flyers lost this game, so their record went from 22-5-4 to 22-6-4, and points remained at 48. So that's a loss.\n\nWait, in the first encounter (Row7), they won with a 6-4 score. That would be a regulation win, giving them 2 points. The second time (Row12), they lost, so no points for that game.\n\nBut the claim says they won by 3 points. That's confusing because normally a win is 2 points. Maybe it's referring to the point difference in the game? But the score was 6-4, which is a 2-goal difference, not 3 points. Alternatively, maybe they're talking about the team's total points after the game.\n\nIn Row7, before the game, their points were 42 (from Row6). After winning Game 28 (Row7), their points became 44. So that's an increase of 2 points, which aligns with a regular win. There's no instance where they gained 3 points from a single game against Boston.\n\nLooking through all the rows, I don't see any game where Philadelphia Flyers earned 3 points specifically against Boston Bruins. They played twice: once winning (2 points) and once losing (0 points). So the claim that they won by 3 points doesn't hold because each win gives only 2 points in hockey.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
