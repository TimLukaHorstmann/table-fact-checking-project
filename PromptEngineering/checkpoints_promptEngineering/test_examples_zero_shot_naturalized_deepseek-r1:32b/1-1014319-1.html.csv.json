The claim is: \"the dance tango with song hung up receive a 10 from goodman and be also rat by tonioli.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the components of the claim:\n\n1. Dance type: Tango\n2. Song: Hung Up\n3. Received a score of 10 from Goodman.\n4. Also rated by Tonioli (I think \"rat\" is a typo for \"rated\").\n\nLooking through the table rows to find where dance/song matches \"tango / hung up.\" \n\nRow 11 in week 11 has dance/song: tango / hung up. So that's the relevant row.\n\nNow, check Goodman's score in this row. The GOODMAN column shows a 10 for this row (row_index 10 since it's zero-based? Wait no, looking at the rows provided: Row 12 is week 11, tango / hung up. Let me recount:\n\nRows are from 0 to 14 as per the list given.\n\nRow 0: Week 1\n...\nRow 10: Week 11, dance/song: salsa / spinning around\nRow 11: Week 11, swing / in the mood\nRow 12: Week 11, tango / hung up\n\nSo row_index is 12.\n\nIn this row, GOODMAN has a value of 10. So that part is correct.\n\nNext, checking if it was rated by Tonioli. The TONIOLO column exists and for this row, the score is 9. Since there's a value (not N/A), it means Tonioli did rate them.\n\nSo both conditions are met: Goodman gave a 10 and Tonioli also rated (with a 9). Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row 12, GOODMAN\n- Row 12, TONIOLO\n\nI should return TRUE with these two cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"goodman\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"tonioli\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"goodman give an 8 to all song that be , rank a 7 from horwood , have a total score of 31 , and have a safe result\". Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse each part of the claim:\n\n1. Goodman gives an 8 to all songs.\n2. Horwood ranks them with a 7.\n3. The total score is 31.\n4. The result is \"safe\".\n\nI need to check if there's any row in the table that meets all these conditions.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row and see if it matches all four points.\n\nStarting from Row 1:\n- Goodman:8, Horwood:7, Total:31, Result:n/a. The result isn't \"safe\", so this doesn't fit.\n\nRow 2:\n- Goodman:8, Horwood:7, Total:31, Result: safe. This matches all four conditions.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"all song that be\" which might mean every instance where these conditions are met. But in Row 2, it's one such case. However, I need to check if there are multiple rows matching this or just one.\n\nLooking further:\n\nRow 3:\n- Goodman:7 (not 8), so doesn't fit.\n\nRow 4:\n- Total is 35, not 31.\n\nRow 5:\n- Total is 34.\n\nRow 6:\n- Total is 35.\n\nRow 7:\n- Total is 35.\n\nRow 8:\n- Total is 38.\n\nRow 9:\n- Total is 35.\n\nRow 10:\n- Total is 28, Goodman:7 (but here, Horwood also has 7? Wait, Row 10: horwood:7, goodman:9. So Goodman isn't giving an 8 here. So no match.\n\nRows 11 and beyond don't seem to fit because either the total isn't 31 or other conditions aren't met.\n\nSo only Row 2 matches all four parts of the claim. The claim says \"all song that be\", which might imply that whenever Horwood gives a 7, Goodman gives an 8 and total is 31 with result safe. But in this case, there's only one such row (Row 2). So as long as that exists, the claim holds for that specific instance.\n\nTherefore, since at least one row meets all conditions, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goodman\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"horwood\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"dixon give the score 10 to the song samba / young heart run free , which be in second place\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts:\n1. Dixon gave a score of 10 to the song \"samba / young hearts run free\".\n2. This song was in second place.\n\nI need to check both statements against the table data.\n\nLooking at the table rows where the dance/song is \"samba / young hearts run free\". From the provided rows, I see this occurs in week 8 and week 13.\n\nFor row 8 (week 8):\n- Dance/Song: samba / young hearts run free\n- Dixon's score: 10\n- Result: safe\n\nSo, here Dixon gave a 10. But the result was \"safe\", not second place.\n\nNext, row 13 (week 12):\n- Dance/Song: samba / young hearts run free\n- Dixon's score: 10\n- Result: second place\n\nHere, Dixon also scored it as 10 and the result is second place. So both parts of the claim are satisfied here.\n\nHowever, wait\u2014I need to make sure there aren't other instances where this song was in second place but Dixon didn't give a 10. Looking at week 8 again: same song, Dixon gave 10, but result was safe. The only time it's in second place is row 13, and in that case, Dixon did give 10.\n\nWait another thing\u2014row 12 (week 11) has a different dance/song \"swing / in the mood\" but let me check other rows again to be thorough. \n\nLooking through all rows, only week 8 and 13 have \"samba / young hearts run free\". So, the claim specifically refers to when it's in second place, which is row 13.\n\nTherefore, both conditions are met in row 13: Dixon gave 10, and the result was second place. \n\nWait a moment, but in week 8, the same song had Dixon scoring 10 as well, but the result was \"safe\". So the claim says that when it's in second place, Dixon gave 10.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"goodman give the score 9 to samba / young heart run free , which be in second place\"\n\nI'll start by identifying the key parts of this claim:\n1. Goodman gave a score of 9 for the dance/song \"samba / young hearts run free\".\n2. This performance was in second place.\n\nLet's check each part against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see multiple rows. I need to find rows where the dance is samba and the song is \"young hearts run free\".\n\nScanning through:\n- Row 8: Week 8 has samba / young hearts run free with Goodman scoring 9. The result is safe.\n- Rows 13, 14, 15 are for week 12. Looking at row 13, it's also samba / young hearts run free but the result here is second place.\n\nWait, so there are two entries for \"samba / young hearts run free\". One in week 8 and another in week 12.\n\nIn week 8 (Row 8), Goodman scored 9. The result was safe.\nIn week 12 (Row 13), Goodman's score isn't specified, but looking at the columns: row 13 has dance/song as samba / young hearts run free, and under goodman it's 9. So, in that instance, the result is second place.\n\nSo, the claim mentions that Goodman gave a 9 to this performance which was in second place. That would correspond to Row 13.\n\nNow, checking if all conditions are met:\n- Is there an entry where dance/song is samba / young hearts run free and result is second place? Yes, row 13.\n- Does Goodman score 9 in that same row? Yes, goodman: 9.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are from row 13 for Goodman's score of 9 and the dance/song as well as the result.\n\nI need to list these cells:\n- \"dance / song\" column in row 13\n- \"goodman\" column in row 13\n- \"result\" column in row 13\n\nSo, the relevant_cells will include these three entries from row 13.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"dance / song\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"goodman\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"1 song receive a 10 from goodman and be rat 7 by tonioli\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It states that there's one song where Goodman gave a rating of 10 and Tonioli gave a rating of 7. I'll need to check each row in the table to see if any entry meets both these conditions simultaneously.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a week with details like dance/song, ratings from Horwood, Goodman, Dixon, and Tonioli, total points, and result. The relevant columns here are 'goodman' and 'tonioli'.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- **Row 1**: Goodman has 8, Tonioli has 8 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n- **Row 2**: Goodman:8, Tonioli:8 \u2192 No.\n- **Row 3**: Goodman:7, Tonioli:8 \u2192 Close, but Goodman isn't 10 here.\n- **Row 4**: Goodman:9, Tonioli:8 \u2192 Still no.\n- **Row 5**: Goodman:8, Tonioli:9 \u2192 Nope.\n- **Row 6**: Goodman:9, Tonioli:9 \u2192 Not matching.\n- **Row 7**: Goodman:9, Tonioli:9 \u2192 Same as above.\n- **Row 8**: Goodman:9, Tonioli:10 \u2192 Here, Goodman is 9 and Tonioli is 10. The claim was Goodman 10 and Tonioli 7, so this doesn't fit either.\n- **Row 9**: Goodman:9, Tonioli:9 \u2192 No match.\n- **Row 10**: Goodman:7, Tonioli:7 \u2192 Both have 7, but Goodman isn't 10 here. So not what we're looking for.\n- **Row 11**: This row seems a bit different; dance/song is Swing and the result mentions points as 2nd/4. The ratings are N/A, so we can skip this since there's no numerical data to check.\n- **Row 12**: Goodman:10, Tonioli:9 \u2192 Here, Goodman has given a 10, but Tonioli gave a 9, not 7. So it doesn't fit the claim either.\n- **Row 13**: Goodman:9, Tonioli:10 \u2192 Again, Goodman isn't 10 here; Tonioli is 10.\n- **Row 14**: Goodman:9, Tonioli:9 \u2192 No match.\n- **Row 15**: Goodman:8, Tonioli:9 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nAfter checking all rows, I don't find any instance where Goodman rated a song with a 10 and Tonioli rated it with a 7 at the same time. The closest was in row 12 where Goodman gave a 10 but Tonioli gave a 9, and in row 10 where both were 7s, but Goodman wasn't 10 there.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by any data in the table. So, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"goodman give score 4 to samba / young heart run free , which be in second place.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the components of the claim. There are two main parts here: \n1. Goodman gave a score of 4 to \"samba / young hearts run free.\"\n2. This performance was in second place.\n\nI'll start by looking through the table for any entries related to samba and \"young hearts run free.\" \n\nLooking at the rows, I see that Row 8 is about week 8 with dance/song as samba / young hearts run free. The scores here are Horwood:9, Goodman:9, Dixon:10, Tonioli:10. So the total is 38, and the result is \"safe.\" \n\nNext, I check other weeks to see if there's another entry with samba and that song. Row 13 also mentions samba / young hearts run free in week 12. The scores here are Horwood:9, Goodman:9, Dixon:10, Tonioli:10, totaling 38 as well, but the result is \"second place.\"\n\nWait a minute, so there's another entry for the same dance/song in week 12. In this row (Row 13), Goodman's score is also 9, not 4. So neither of these rows shows Goodman giving a score of 4.\n\nNow, considering the claim mentions \"second place.\" Looking at Row 13 and Row 14, both are from week 12. Row 13 has samba / young hearts run free with result second place, but Goodman scored it 9. There's no mention of a score 4 here.\n\nLooking through all the rows again, I don't see any instance where Goodman gave a score of 4 to \"samba / young hearts run free.\" In fact, Goodman's scores for this dance/song are consistently higher: either 9 or 10. \n\nSo both parts of the claim seem incorrect. First, Goodman didn't give a score of 4; second, the samba performance was in second place, but only in week 12 with a high score, not because of a low score like 4 from Goodman.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Goodman gave a score of 4 to \"samba / young hearts run free\" which resulted in second place.

Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"goodman\"},\n     {\"row_13\", \"goodman\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
