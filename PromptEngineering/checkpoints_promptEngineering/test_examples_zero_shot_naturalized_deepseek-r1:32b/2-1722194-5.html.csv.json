    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, the task is to determine whether the claim \"the building that remain the tallest in montreal today be the 1000 de la gaucheti\u00e8re\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that as of today, the tallest building in Montreal is 1000 De La Gaucheti\u00e8re. To verify this, I'll look at the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different building with various details like name, address, years it was the tallest, how many years it held that title, height in meters and feet, and number of floors.\n\nI need to find out which building is currently the tallest. The claim says it's 1000 De La Gaucheti\u00e8re. Let me check the rows for this building.\n\nLooking through each row:\n- Row 1: Notre Dame Basilica \u2013 years as tallest until 1928.\n- Row 2: Royal Bank Building \u2013 from 1928 to 1931.\n- Row 3: Sun Life Building \u2013 from 1931 to 1962.\n- Row 4: Tour CIBC \u2013 in 1962, only for less than a year.\n- Row 5: Place Ville Marie \u2013 from 1962 to 1964.\n- Row 6: Tour De La Bourse \u2013 from 1964 to 1992.\n- Row 7: 1000 De La Gaucheti\u00e8re \u2013 from 1992 to present.\n\nSo, according to the table, 1000 De La Gaucheti\u00e8re has been the tallest since 1992 and is still holding that title today. That aligns with the claim.\n\nAdditionally, checking the height of each building:\n- Row 7: Height is 205 meters / 673 feet.\nLooking at other buildings before it:\n- Tour De La Bourse (Row 6): 194m / 637ft\n- Place Ville Marie (Row 5): 188m / 617ft\n- Sun Life Building: 122m / 400ft\n\nSo yes, 1000 De La Gaucheti\u00e8re is indeed the tallest as per the given data.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"the building that remain the tallest in montreal today be the 1000 de la gaucheti\u00e8re\" is supported by the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"Regardless of both building have 47 floor, the tour de la bourse take the title of the tallest building from the place ville marie in 1964 by a mere 6 / 20 m / ft difference.\"\n\nFirst, I should check if both buildings mentioned (Tour de la Bourse and Place Ville Marie) have 47 floors. Looking at the table:\n\n- Tour de la Bourse is on row 6: Floors are 47.\n- Place Ville Marie is on row 5: Floors are also 47.\n\nSo, both have the same number of floors, which matches the claim.\n\nNext, I need to confirm when Tour de la Bourse took over as the tallest building. The claim says it happened in 1964. Checking the \"years as tallest\" for each:\n\n- Place Ville Marie was tallest from 1962 to 1964.\n- Tour de la Bourse became tallest starting in 1964.\n\nThis part checks out; Tour de la Bourse took over in 1964.\n\nNow, the claim mentions a height difference of 6 meters (or 20 feet). Let's look at their heights:\n\n- Place Ville Marie: 188 m / 617 ft.\n- Tour de la Bourse: 194 m / 637 ft.\n\nCalculating the difference in meters: 194 - 188 = 6 m. In feet: 637 - 617 = 20 ft. This matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nI should also ensure there are no other buildings with similar heights around that time, but looking at the table, after Place Ville Marie, Tour de la Bourse is indeed next and has the height difference as claimed.\n\nSo, all parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE.

Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"from 1829 - 1928, the notre dame basilica be the tallest building and still hold the record for the most year be the tallest.\"\n\nFirst, I'll check if Notre Dame Basilica was indeed the tallest from 1829 to 1928. Looking at Row 1 of the table, it shows that Notre Dame Basilica held the title as the tallest building from 1829 to 1928 for 99 years. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, I need to verify if it still holds the record for the most years being the tallest. The claim mentions \"most year be the tallest,\" which I interpret as having the longest period of being the tallest. \n\nLooking at all the rows:\n\n- Row 1: 99 years\n- Row 2: 3 years\n- Row 3: 31 years\n- Row 4: <1 year\n- Row 5: 2 years\n- Row 6: 28 years\n- Row 7: 21 years (current)\n\nComparing all these durations, the longest is indeed 99 years by Notre Dame Basilica.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the tour cibc be the tallest building for the least amount of year , follow by place ville marie\". \n\nFirst, I should parse the claim correctly. It seems like it's saying that Tour CIBC was the tallest building for the least number of years, and then Place Ville Marie followed it. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a building with details about when they were the tallest. The relevant columns here are \"name\" to identify buildings and \"of years as tallest\" which shows how many years each held the title.\n\nStarting with Tour CIBC: In Row 4, it's listed as being the tallest in 1962 for less than a year (<1 year). That means it was the shortest time as the tallest. So that part of the claim is correct.\n\nNext, Place Ville Marie is in Row 5. It held the title from 1962 to 1964, which is 2 years. According to the table, after Tour CIBC (which was only for less than a year), Place Ville Marie did come next as the tallest building for two more years. So the sequence in the claim is accurate: Tour CIBC first with the least time, followed by Place Ville Marie.\n\nI should also check if there are any other buildings that might have had a shorter period. Looking through all the rows, Tour CIBC's duration is indeed the shortest at less than one year. The next shortest after that is Place Ville Marie with two years, which fits the claim.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Tour CIBC was the tallest building for the least amount of time, followed by Place Ville Marie. From the table, Tour CIBC held the title for less than a year, and Place Ville Marie followed with two years.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim about the Sun Life Building and Notre Dame Basilica being the tallest buildings in Montreal for a certain period of time is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim says: \"the sun life building remain the tallest building in montreal for close to a third of the time of the notre dame basilica.\" So, this means that the duration during which Sun Life was the tallest should be approximately one-third of the time Notre Dame held that title.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll focus on the relevant columns: \"years as tallest\" and \"of years as tallest.\"\n\nFrom the first row (Notre Dame Basilica), it's stated that it was the tallest from 1829 to 1928. The number of years it held this title is 99 years.\n\nIn the third row (Sun Life Building), it was the tallest from 1931 to 1962, which is 31 years.\n\nNow, I need to check if 31 years is close to a third of 99 years. Calculating a third of 99 gives us approximately 33 years (since 99 divided by 3 is exactly 33). The Sun Life Building held the title for 31 years, which is very close to 33 years\u2014just two years less.\n\nConsidering that \"close to\" allows some flexibility, this seems accurate. Therefore, the claim appears to be true.\n\nNext, I'll identify the relevant cells from the table used in this analysis. For Notre Dame Basilica, we look at row 0 (assuming rows are zero-indexed) and specifically the column \"of years as tallest.\" Similarly, for Sun Life Building, it's row 2 with the same column.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 0, Column: of years as tallest\n- Row 2, Column: of years as tallest\n\nPutting this all together, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it's stating that Notre Dame Basilica remains the tallest building in Montreal as of today. To verify this, I should check two things\u2014what is the current status of Notre Dame Basilica and whether any other buildings are taller than it currently.\n\nLooking at the table, each row provides information about different buildings, including their years as the tallest. Let's see:\n\n- Row 1: Notre Dame Basilica was the tallest from 1829 to 1928 for 99 years. So, after 1928, it was no longer the tallest.\n  \nContinuing down the rows:\n- Royal Bank Building took over in 1928 and held the title until 1931.\n- Sun Life Building from 1931 to 1962.\n- Tour CIBC in 1962, but only for less than a year.\n- Place Ville Marie from 1962 to 1964.\n- Tour de la Bourse from 1964 to 1992.\n\nNow, the last row (Row 7) mentions 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re which has been the tallest since 1992 and is still holding that title today as indicated by \"present\" in its years. Its height is 205 meters or 673 feet with 51 floors.\n\nComparing heights:\n- Notre Dame Basilica's height is 69 meters (226 ft) which is significantly less than the current tallest at 205 meters.\n  \nSo, based on this data, Notre Dame Basilica hasn't been the tallest since 1928. The current tallest is 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re.\n\nTherefore, the claim that it remains the tallest today is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells would be those showing the years as the tallest and their respective heights. Specifically:\n- Notre Dame Basilica's end year (1928) and height.\n- The current tallest building's start year (1992) and height.\n\nSo, I'll note the rows and columns that support this conclusion.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Notre Dame Basilica stopped being the tallest in 1928, and the current tallest is another building.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"height m  / ft\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"height m  / ft\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It has 47 floors.\n- Tour de la Bourse is Row 6. It also has 47 floors.\nSo, actually, they have the same number of floors. The claim says Place Ville Marie has more floors, which isn't true.\n\nPart 2: \"Tour de la Bourse took the title of the tallest building from Place Ville Marie in 1964.\"\nFrom the table:\n- Place Ville Marie was the tallest from 1962 to 1964.\n- Tour de la Bourse became the tallest starting in 1964 and held that title until 1992.\n\nSo, in 1964, Tour de la Bourse did take over as the tallest building. That part of the claim is correct.\n\nNow, combining both parts:\nThe first part about more floors is incorrect because they have equal floors. However, the second part about taking the title in 1964 is correct. But since the first part isn't true, the entire claim isn't fully accurate. The reason for the change in the tallest building wasn't due to having more floors but perhaps height or another factor.\n\nWait, let's check their heights:\n- Place Ville Marie: 188m / 617ft\n- Tour de la Bourse: 194m / 637ft\n\nTour de la Bourse is taller. So the title change makes sense because it's taller, not necessarily more floors.\n\nBut the claim specifically mentions that Place Ville Marie has more floors, which isn't accurate since they have the same number. Therefore, the statement incorrectly attributes the reason for the title change to the number of floors instead of height.\n\nSo the overall claim is false because while Tour de la Bourse did become taller in 1964, it's not because Place Ville Marie had more floors\u2014it was actually about being taller in height.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because although Tour de la Bourse became the tallest building in 1964, it's incorrect to say Place Ville Marie has more floors since they both have 47.

The claim has two parts: \n1. Place Ville Marie was the tallest building.\n2. It held this title for the least number of years compared to others in the table.\n\nI need to check both parts against the table data.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a building with details about when it was the tallest, how many years it held that title, height, floors, etc.\n\nFirst, I'll find Place Ville Marie. Scanning through the rows:\n\nRow 5 has name: place ville marie, so that's the relevant row. Its \"years as tallest\" are from 1962 to 1964, which is 2 years. So it was the tallest for 2 years.\n\nNow, I need to check if this is the least number of years among all buildings in the table. Let me list each building's duration:\n\n- Notre Dame Basilica: 99 years\n- Royal Bank Building: 3 years\n- Sun Life Building: 31 years\n- Tour CIBC: <1 year\n- Place Ville Marie: 2 years\n- Tour de la Bourse: 28 years\n- 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re: 21 years\n\nLooking at these durations, the shortest is Tour CIBC with less than a year.

Therefore, the second part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting correctly. The claim says \"the tallest building for the least amount of year.\" So it's comparing all the periods each building was the tallest. If Tour CIBC held it for less than a year (which is shorter than Place Ville Marie's 2 years), then Place Ville Marie isn't the one with the least duration.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because another building (Tour CIBC) had the title for fewer years.

Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the sun life building remain the tallest building in montreal for the same amount of time as the notre dame basilica\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the relevant columns that contain information about how long each building was the tallest. From the table, it seems that the \"years as tallest\" and \"of years as tallest\" columns are important here.\n\nStarting with Notre Dame Basilica: It's in Row 1. The \"years as tallest\" is from 1829 to 1928, which spans a period of 99 years according to the \"of years as tallest\" column.\n\nNext, checking Sun Life Building, which is in Row 3. Its \"years as tallest\" are from 1931 to 1962, and it held that title for 31 years.\n\nComparing the two durations: Notre Dame was the tallest for 99 years, while Sun Life was for 31 years. Clearly, these periods are not equal. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nTo identify the relevant cells, I'll note the rows and columns that provided this information. For Notre Dame Basilica, it's Row 1 with both \"years as tallest\" and \"of years as tallest.\" Similarly, for Sun Life Building, it's Row 3 with the same two columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim compares the duration each building was the tallest. Notre Dame was tallest for longer than Sun Life.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
