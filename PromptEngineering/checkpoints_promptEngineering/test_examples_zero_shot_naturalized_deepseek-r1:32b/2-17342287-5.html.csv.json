    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"there be 8 games at the boston garden, all before december 17\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table and check two conditions: whether the location was Boston Garden and whether the date of the game was before December 17.\n\nLooking at Row 1:\n- Location: Boston Garden\n- Date: December 3 (which is before Dec 17)\nSo this counts as one game.\n\nRow 2:\n- Location: St. Louis Arena\nNot relevant, so I'll skip it.\n\nRow 3:\n- Location: Cincinnati\nNope, moving on.\n\nRow 4:\n- New York, NY\nNot Boston Garden.\n\nRow 5:\n- Location: Boston Garden\nDate: December 8 (before Dec 17)\nThat's two games.\n\nRow 6:\n- Boston Garden\nDate: December 11\nThree games so far.\n\nRow 7:\n- Boston Garden\nDate: December 15\nFour games now.\n\nRow 8:\n- Location: Detroit\nNot relevant. Record is 19-8, but location doesn't match.\n\nRow 9:\n- Boston Garden\nDate: December 22 (which is after Dec 17)\nSo this one's on the wrong date.\n\nRows 10 to 14 don't have Boston Garden as their location except for Row 5,6,7. Wait, let me check all rows again to make sure I haven't missed any.\n\nWait, Row 9: December 22 is after Dec 17, so it doesn't count.\n\nNow, counting the games at Boston Garden before Dec 17:\nRow 1, 5,6,7. That's four games, not eight.\n\nSo the claim says there are eight games at Boston Garden all before Dec 17, but according to the table, only four such games exist.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there were 8 games at Boston Garden before December 17. Checking each game:\n\n- Games at Boston Garden: Rows 1 (Dec 3), 5 (Dec 8), 6 (Dec 11), and 7 (Dec 15). These are four games, all before Dec 17.\n\nNo other games in the table meet both conditions. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
