    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"the power of the 1972 engine be not give in hp (kw)\". So, I'm looking for whether the power value for the 1972 engine is provided in horsepower or kilowatts.\n\nFirst, let me go through each row to find any mention of the year 1972. Looking at Row 3: generation i, years 1972, engine 455in cubic Oldsmobile V8. The power column here has a dash \"-\", and torque is \"n/a\". Induction is 4bbl carburetor.\n\nSo, in the power column for 1972, it's just a dash, which I think means that the information isn't provided. Therefore, the power isn't given in hp or kw, supporting the claim.\n\nI don't see any other rows with 1972 mentioned except Row 3. So, this is the only relevant cell. The answer should be TRUE because the power isn't specified.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the power of the 1972 engine isn't provided in hp or kw. Checking the table, the row for 1972 shows a dash under power, confirming it's not given.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"power\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
