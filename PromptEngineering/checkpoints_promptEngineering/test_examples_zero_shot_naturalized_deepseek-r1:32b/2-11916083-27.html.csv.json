The table has entries from 2008 and 2009 for various hockey teams, each with an issue price and special notes.\n\nI notice that in every row, there are two possible issue prices: 15.95 and 24.95. For example, the first four rows of 2008 have these prices, and this pattern continues through all the teams for both years. \n\nThe claim states that the highest issue price is 24.95 and the lowest is 15.95. Since I see no other issue prices in the table besides these two values, it appears that 24.95 is indeed the highest and 15.95 is the lowest.\n\nTo confirm, I'll list out all the issue prices from the table:\n- For each team in 2008: both 15.95 and 24.95 are present.\n- In 2009, only 24.95 is listed for each team, but since there were lower prices in 2008, the overall minimum remains at 15.95.\n\nTherefore, the claim accurately reflects the range of issue prices in the table. There are no other prices higher than 24.95 or lower than 15.95, so both parts of the claim hold true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"1 third of the coin from coin and puck set\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, understanding the claim: It says that one-third of the coins come from the \"coin and puck set.\" I think this means we need to check if exactly one-third of all entries in the table have their special notes as \"from coin and puck set.\"\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different item with details like year, theme, artist, issue price, and special notes. The key here is the 'special_notes' column because that's where we can find whether an entry belongs to the \"coin and puck set\" or another gift set.\n\nLet me count how many entries are there in total. There are 18 rows, each corresponding to a different hockey team (Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs, Vancouver Canucks) across two years (2008 and 2009). Each team has two entries per year, one for \"coin and puck set\" and another for their respective gift sets. \n\nIn 2008, each team has a \"coin and puck set\" with an issue price of 15.95 and another entry from the gift set at 24.95. Similarly, in 2009, all entries are only from the gift sets, as seen by their special notes.\n\nSo, for year 2008, each team has two entries: one with \"coin and puck set\" (6 teams \u00d71 = 6) and another from the gift set. That makes 12 rows in total for 2008. Then, in 2009, all 6 teams have only one entry each, totaling 6 more rows. So overall, 12 + 6 = 18 rows.\n\nNow, focusing on the \"coin and puck set\" entries: in 2008, there are 6 such entries (one per team). In 2009, none of the special notes mention the coin and puck set; all are from gift sets. Therefore, the total number of \"coin and puck set\" entries is 6.\n\nThe claim states that one-third of the coins come from this set. Let's calculate: Total number of coins = 18. One-third of 18 is 6. Since there are exactly 6 entries in the \"coin and puck set,\" the claim holds true.\n\nTo confirm, I can list out the relevant cells. Each of these 6 entries has 'special_notes' as \"from coin and puck set.\" They are rows 0 through 5 (since indexing starts at 0) for year 2008. So their row indices are 0 to 5 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"special_notes\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"special_notes\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"special_notes\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"special_notes\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"special_notes\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"special_notes\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"each theme be use 3 time.\" Hmm, I think it means each theme should appear exactly three times in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has 18 rows, all from the year 2008 and 2009. Each row has a 'theme' which are different hockey teams: Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs, Vancouver Canucks.\n\nNow, I'll count how many times each theme appears in the table. Let's go through each theme one by one.\n\nStarting with Calgary Flames:\n- 2008: There are two entries (Row 1 and Row 2).\n- 2009: One entry (Row 13).\nSo that's a total of three times for Calgary Flames.\n\nNext, Edmonton Oilers:\n- 2008: Two entries (Rows 3 and 4).\n- 2009: One entry (Row 14).\nTotal is also three.\n\nMontreal Canadiens:\n- 2008: Two rows (5 and 6).\n- 2009: One row (15).\nAgain, three times.\n\nOttawa Senators:\n- 2008: Rows 7 and 8.\n- 2009: Row 16.\nThree in total.\n\nToronto Maple Leafs:\n- 2008: Rows 9 and 10.\n- 2009: Row 17.\nThat's three as well.\n\nVancouver Canucks:\n- 2008: Rows 11 and 12.\n- 2009: Row 18.\nThree instances here too.\n\nWait, but the table has rows up to 18. Let me recount just to be sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nCalgary Flames: 2 in '08, 1 in '09 \u2192 3\nEdmonton Oilers: same pattern \u2192 3\nMontreal Canadiens: same \u2192 3\nOttawa Senators: same \u2192 3\nToronto Maple Leafs: same \u2192 3\nVancouver Canucks: same \u2192 3\n\nEach theme appears exactly three times. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I think each row's 'theme' column is relevant because they all contribute to showing how many times each theme occurs. But since the instruction says to list the relevant cells for verifying the claim, which requires checking each occurrence of each theme.\n\nWait, but perhaps only some rows are necessary to confirm that each theme is used three times. However, since the claim is about every theme being exactly three times, we need to check all instances across both years for each team.\n\nSo I'll list all the relevant 'theme' cells from Rows 1 to 18 where each team appears.\n\nBut maybe it's more efficient to just note that each theme in both years contributes to the count. So perhaps just showing a few examples might not be enough, but since the claim is about each theme being used three times, I need to ensure all rows are checked for their themes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the first occurrence of each theme across both years is needed, but that doesn't seem sufficient because we have to confirm that no theme appears more than three times or less. Therefore, the relevant cells would be every row's 'theme' column where each team appears.\n\nBut considering the table has 18 rows and each team appears three times (2 in 2008, 1 in 2009 except for maybe some), but actually, all teams have two entries in 2008 and one in 2009, making it three each. So all the 'theme' cells across Rows 1-18 are relevant because they all contribute to the count.\n\nWait, but perhaps not all rows are needed for the claim. Since we need to verify that each theme is used exactly three times, and given that there are six themes, each appearing three times (2 in 08, 1 in 09), then each of their instances is relevant. So I'll include all 'theme' cells from Rows 1-18.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that each theme appears exactly three times. Upon reviewing the table, each hockey team's theme (Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs, Vancouver Canucks) indeed occurs three times: twice in 2008 and once in 2009. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"result\": {\n        \"status\": \"TRUE\",\n        \"explanation\": \"Each theme appears exactly three times across the years 2008 and 2009.\"\n    },\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"theme\"}\n    ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the toronto maple leaf coin sell for both 24.95 and 15.95.\" Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. Each row has columns: year, theme, artist, issue price, and special notes. The artist column is 'n/a' in all cases, so that doesn't matter here.\n\nThe claim mentions \"toronto maple leaf,\" which matches the 'theme' column. So I need to find all rows where theme is 'toronto maple leafs' (I notice it's plural in the table: 'leafs'). \n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 9: Year 2008, theme toronto maple leafs, issue price 15.95, special notes from coin and puck set.\n- Row 10: Year 2008, same theme, issue price 24.95, special notes from toronto maple leafs gift set.\n\nSo for the toronto maple leafs coins in 2008, there are two different issue prices: 15.95 and 24.95. \n\nNow, checking other years:\n\n- Rows 17 is 2009, same theme, issue price 24.95. But the claim doesn't specify a year, just that they sell for both prices.\n\nSo in total, across all years, toronto maple leafs coins have been issued at both 15.95 and 24.95. Specifically, row 9 is 15.95 and rows 10 and 17 are 24.95. But the claim says they sell for both, which is true because in 2008, there's both prices.\n\nWait, but does it? Let me check if all toronto maple leafs entries have both prices or just some years. In 2008, yes, two rows with different prices. In 2009, only one price (24.95). So the claim is about whether they sell for both, not necessarily in the same year.\n\nBut the way the claim is phrased: \"sell for both\" implies that there are instances where it's sold at each of those prices. Since 15.95 exists and 24.95 also exists in different rows, the claim holds.\n\nSo relevant cells would be row 9 (price 15.95) and row 10 (price 24.95), both for toronto maple leafs.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because there are entries where Toronto Maple Leafs coins have both issue prices of $15.95 and $24.95.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user has provided a table with several rows of data about hockey teams and their respective coin sets from 2008 and 2009. The claim we need to evaluate is: \"the highest issue price 24.95 and the lowest be 14.95.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each part of the table represents. Each row has a year, theme (which seems to represent different hockey teams), artist, issue price, and special notes. The claim is about the highest and lowest issue prices in this dataset.\n\nLooking at the data, all entries have either 15.95 or 24.95 as their issue price. There's no mention of a 14.95 anywhere in the table. That stands out immediately because the claim mentions both 24.95 and 14.95. \n\nNext, I'll check each row to confirm the issue prices. For example, Row 1 has an issue price of 15.95, Row 2 is 24.95, and this pattern continues with alternating between these two amounts for different themes and years. In both 2008 and 2009, all entries either have 15.95 or 24.95 as their issue price.\n\nSo, the highest issue price is indeed 24.95. That part of the claim checks out. However, the lowest issue price according to the table is 15.95, not 14.95 as stated in the claim. \n\nSince the claim incorrectly states that the lowest issue price is 14.95 when there's no such value present, this makes the entire claim false. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\" \n\nTo support this conclusion, I'll note which cells are relevant. The highest issue price of 24.95 appears in several rows across both years and different teams. For example, Row 2 has it for Calgary Flames in 2008, and Row 13 also shows 24.95 for Calgary Flames in 2009. On the other hand, the lowest price is consistently 15.95, such as in Row 1 (Calgary Flames, 2008) and Row 3 (Edmonton Oilers, 2008), among others.\n\nSince there's no occurrence of 14.95, the claim about the lowest being that amount is unsupported by the data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

For each team, how many times do they appear?\n\nIn 2008:\n- Each team has two rows: one with issue price $15.95 and another with $24.95.\n\nSimilarly, in 2009:\n- Again, each team has one row with issue price $24.95.\n\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nIn 2008, each theme appears twice (rows 1-2 for Calgary, 3-4 Edmonton, etc.), and in 2009, each theme appears once more. So total per team is three times?\n\nWait, let me count again:\n\nFor example, Calgary Flames:\nRow 1: 2008, $15.95\nRow 2: 2008, $24.95\nRow 13: 2009, $24.95\n\nThat's three times. Same for all other teams.\n\nBut the claim says each theme is used four times. So if they are only appearing three times in total across both years, the claim would be FALSE.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe the user meant within a single year? But no, because the table spans two years. Alternatively, perhaps the count is per year?\n\nIn 2008, each theme appears twice (rows 1-2 for Calgary, same pattern for others). In 2009, each theme appears once (rows 13-18: one row each except maybe I miscounted).\n\nWait, let me list all the rows:\n\nRows 1-12 are from 2008:\n- Each team has two entries.\n\nRows 13-18 are from 2009:\n- Each team has one entry. Wait no, actually looking at row indices:\n\nRow 13: Calgary Flames\nRow 14: Edmonton Oilers\nRow 15: Montreal Canadiens\nRow 16: Ottawa Senators\nRow 17: Toronto Maple Leafs\nRow 18: Vancouver Canucks\n\nSo in 2009, each team has only one row. So total per team is 2 (from 2008) +1 (from 2009)=3.\n\nThus, each theme appears three times, not four. Therefore, the claim that each theme was used four times is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that each theme is used four times. Upon examining the table, each hockey team's theme appears twice in 2008 and once in 2009, totaling three occurrences per theme. Since none of the themes appear four times, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"theme\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"1 half of the coin from coin and puck set\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It says that 1/2 (half) of the coins come from the \"coin and puck set.\" So, I need to check if exactly half of all the entries in the table are part of this specific set.\n\nLooking at the table, there are two main themes: each hockey team has two rows\u2014one for a coin and puck set with an issue price of 15.95 and another from a gift set with an issue price of 24.95. This pattern repeats for each team in both 2008 and 2009.\n\nSo, let's count the total number of entries. From rows 1 to 12 (year 2008), there are six teams, each with two entries\u2014so 6 * 2 = 12 entries for 2008. For 2009, from row 13 to 18, it's six teams but only one entry each, all from the gift set at 24.95. So, that's another 6 entries.\n\nWait a minute\u2014that makes a total of 18 entries (12 + 6). But in the table provided, row indices go up to 18 because it starts counting from 0, so there are actually 18 rows (indices 0-17) but only 18 entries\u2014wait no, that's not right. Let me recount:\n\nRows 1 to 12: 6 teams with two entries each in 2008 \u2192 12 entries.\nRows 13 to 18: 6 teams with one entry each in 2009 \u2192 6 entries.\nTotal: 12 + 6 = 18 rows, but the table as given has rows up to row 18 (since it starts at 0), which would be 19 rows. Wait no, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait the table as described goes from Row 1 to Row 18, so that's 18 entries? Or is each \"Row\" a separate entry? Let me check again:\n\nThe table has rows listed as Row 1 through Row 18, but in reality, when data starts at row 0, it would be rows 0-17. So perhaps the user meant there are 18 entries (rows 0 to 17). But looking back, I think each line is a separate entry, so:\n\nRows listed from Row 1 to Row 18: that's 18 entries in total.\n\nWait no, because the first row is labeled as Row 1, but typically tables start at index 0. Hmm, perhaps it's better not to get confused here and just count based on what's given.\n\nEach year (2008 and 2009) has multiple teams. For 2008, each team appears twice: once with the coin and puck set and once from a gift set. So for each of the six teams in 2008, there are two entries. That's 6 * 2 = 12 rows.\n\nFor 2009, it seems that only one entry per team exists, all from the gift set at 24.95. So that's another 6 rows (rows 13-18). Wait, but in the table as given, row 13 is 2009, Calgary Flames; row 14 Edmonton Oilers, etc., up to row 18 for Vancouver Canucks in 2009.\n\nSo total entries: 12 (for 2008) + 6 (for 2009) = 18 rows. Therefore, the table has 18 entries.\n\nNow, let's count how many of these are from the \"coin and puck set.\" For each team in 2008, there is one entry with special notes: \"from coin and puck set,\" which is at issue price 15.95. So for 2008, six teams * 1 = 6 entries.\n\nFor 2009, all the gift sets are from the gift set, not the coin and puck set. So no additional entries from \"coin and puck set\" in 2009.\n\nSo total entries from \"coin and puck set\": 6 out of 18.\n\nNow, the claim is that half (1/2) of the coins come from this set. Half of 18 is 9. But we only have 6 entries from \"coin and puck set.\" Therefore, 6 < 9, so the claim is not accurate.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting total entries. Let me double-check:\n\nIn 2008: Each team has two entries\u2014one for coin and puck (15.95) and one for gift set (24.95). So six teams * 2 = 12 rows.\n\nIn 2009: Only the gift set, so each of the six teams has one entry\u2014total 6 rows.\n\nSo total entries: 18.\n\nEntries from coin and puck set: only in 2008, which is six. Therefore, 6/18 = 1/3. So one-third, not half.\n\nThus, the claim that \"1 half of the coin from coin and puck set\" would be incorrect because it's actually a third, not half.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that half (50%) of the coins are from the \"coin and puck set.\" However, in the table:\n\n- 6 entries are from the \"coin and puck set.\"\n- Total entries: 18.\n\nThus, only one-third (33.3%) of the entries are from this set, not half. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": \"False\"\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the toronto maple leaf coin sell for both 27.95 and 15.95\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states that Toronto Maple Leaf coins are sold at two different prices: $27.95 and $15.95. I need to check if both these prices exist in the table for the corresponding theme, which is \"toronto maple leafs\".\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row one by one to find entries related to Toronto Maple Leafs. \n\nRow 9: Year 2008, Theme toronto maple leafs, Artist n/a, Issue Price 15.95, Special Notes from coin and puck set. Okay, so there's a price of $15.95 here.\n\nNext, looking for the other price mentioned in the claim, which is $27.95. I'll check all rows related to Toronto Maple Leafs. \n\nRow 10: Year 2008, Theme toronto maple leafs, Artist n/a, Issue Price 24.95, Special Notes from toronto maple leafs gift set.\n\nAnd in 2009:\n\nRow 17: Year 2009, Theme toronto maple leafs, Artist n/a, Issue Price 24.95, Special Notes from toronto maple leafs gift set.\n\nWait a minute, I see that the issue prices for Toronto Maple Leafs are $15.95 and $24.95 in both years, but there's no entry with $27.95. So the claim mentions $27.95, which isn't present in any of the relevant rows.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because while the coin was sold at $15.95 and $24.95, it wasn't sold at $27.95 as per the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions two prices for Toronto Maple Leaf coins: 27.95 and 15.95.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"all of the coin in 2008 have an issue price of 24.95\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It states that every coin from 2008 has an issue price of $24.95. To verify this, I need to check all rows in the table where the year is 2008 and see if their 'issue price' column is indeed 24.95.\n\nLooking at the table, there are two types of entries for each team in 2008: one with an issue price of 15.95 under \"coin and puck set\" and another with 24.95 under \"gift set\". For example:\n\n- Row 1: Calgary Flames, coin and puck set, $15.95\n- Row 2: Calgary Flames, gift set, $24.95\n\nThis pattern repeats for each team in 2008. So, while some coins from 2008 are priced at $24.95 (the gift sets), others are only $15.95 as part of the coin and puck sets.\n\nSince not all coins in 2008 have an issue price of $24.95\u2014some are cheaper\u2014the claim isn't fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells that disprove the claim. Each team has a row with a lower price (15.95) which contradicts the claim. The relevant rows are all even-numbered rows from 1 to 12 where issue price is 15.95. Specifically:\n\n- Rows 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 (if counting starts at 0) or 1,3,5,7,9,11 if starting at 1.\n\nAssuming the rows are indexed from 0 as in programming, the relevant cells would be rows 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. Each of these has a 'issue price' column with 15.95, which shows not all coins were priced at 24.95.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
