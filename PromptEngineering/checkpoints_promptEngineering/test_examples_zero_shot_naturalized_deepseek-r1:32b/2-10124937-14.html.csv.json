    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"when marseille be the first team, the first leg's score be 3 - 1\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim refers to. So, the subject here is Marseille being the first team in a row. Then, we're looking at the first leg's score for that specific row.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several rows with data about different teams and their matches. Each row lists two teams: team 1 and team 2, along with aggregated scores (agg), and the results of the first and second legs.\n\nI'll go through each row to see where Marseille is listed as team 1. Scanning down the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Team 1 is Anderlecht\n- Row 2: Rangers\n- Row 3: Bolton Wanderers\n- Row 4: Bayer Leverkusen\n- Row 5: Benfica\n- Row 6: Fiorentina\n- Row 7: Tottenham Hotspur\n- Row 8: Marseille\n\nAh, here we go. Row 8 has team 1 as Marseille. Now, the claim is about when Marseille is the first team, what's their first leg score. So I need to look at the '1st leg' column for this row.\n\nLooking at Row 8, under '1st leg', it says 3 - 1. That means the first leg score was 3 goals for Marseille and 1 against. \n\nThe claim states that when Marseille is team 1, their first leg's score is 3-1. From the table, that's exactly what happened in Row 8.\n\nSo, checking all conditions: Marseille as team 1 (which is true for Row 8) and the first leg being 3-1 (also true). Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified to be TRUE based on the data in row 8 where Marseille is listed as team 1 with a first leg score of 3-1.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the 1st leg score and the 2nd leg score be the same for the bolton wanderer.\" \n\nFirst, I need to locate Bolton Wanderers in the table. Looking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Anderlecht vs Bayern Munich\n- Row 2: Rangers vs Werder Bremen\n- Row 3: Bolton Wanderers vs Sporting CP\n- The other rows don't mention Bolton.\n\nSo, Row 3 is where Bolton Wanderers are listed as team 1. Now, I should check the columns for both legs in this row. The relevant columns are '1st leg' and '2nd leg'.\n\nLooking at Row 3:\n- 1st leg score: 1 - 1\n- 2nd leg score: 0 - 1\n\nThe claim says that both legs should have the same scores. Comparing them, the 1st leg was a draw (1-1), while the 2nd leg ended with Bolton losing 0-1. Therefore, their scores are not the same.\n\nI need to confirm if I'm interpreting this correctly. The claim doesn't specify which team's score it refers to, just that both legs have the same score. Since the overall scores for both legs aren't equal (Bolton scored 1 in the first leg and 0 in the second), the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are Row 3's '1st leg' and '2nd leg' columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
