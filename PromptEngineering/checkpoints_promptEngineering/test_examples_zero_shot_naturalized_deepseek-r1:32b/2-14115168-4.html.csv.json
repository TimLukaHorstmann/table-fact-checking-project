    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"both the bellevue bruin and the york panther play in the midland conference.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this claim carefully. It's talking about two specific mascots: the Bellevue Bruins and the York Panthers. The claim states that both of these teams are part of the Midland Conference.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see nine rows, each representing a different school with details about their mascot, conference, national titles, founded year, etc. \n\nI need to check for two things: \n1. What is the conference affiliation of the Bellevue Bruins?\n2. What is the conference affiliation of the York Panthers?\n\nStarting with the Bellevue Bruins, I'll scan through each row looking for the school name or mascot that matches. The first row mentions \"bellevue university\" with the mascot \"bellevue bruins.\" So, checking the conference column here, it says \"midlands.\"\n\nNext, for the York Panthers, I look through the rows until I find \"york college,\" whose mascot is indeed the \"york panthers.\" Checking their conference affiliation, it's also listed as \"midlands.\"\n\nSo both teams are in the Midland Conference. Therefore, the claim that both play in the midland conference is true.\n\nI should note the relevant cells to support this conclusion. For the Bellevue Bruins, it's row 0 (since indexing starts at 0) and the columns \"conference.\" Similarly, for York Panthers, it's row 8 and the same column. \n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cells are row 0 with conference and row 8 with conference.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking both mascots' conferences in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"conference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"conference\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The oldest school is the one with the earliest year. Peru State College was founded in 1865, which is earlier than all other schools listed. Therefore, the claim that Peru State College is the oldest according to the date of founding is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells are the \"founded\" column for each row, but since we're only verifying Peru State College's age against others, I'll include its specific cell.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"only 1 school, york college, have won more than 20 titles\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim and break it down. The claim states two things: \n1. Only one school has won more than 20 national titles.\n2. That school is York College.\n\nI need to check both parts of this claim against the data in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school with details including their mascot, conference, number of national titles, and founding year. The relevant column here is \"national titles\" because that's what the claim is about.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one to check how many schools have more than 20 national titles.\n\nRow 1: Bellevue University has 14 titles. That's less than 20.\nRow 2: College of Saint Mary has 0 titles. Definitely not over 20.\nRow 3: Concordia University has 1 title. Still under 20.\nRow 4: Doane College has 10 titles. Also under 20.\nRow 5: Hastings College with 3 titles, still below 20.\nRow 6: Midland University has 2 titles. Not over 20.\nRow 7: Nebraska Wesleyan University has 19 titles. Hmm, that's just one short of 20, so not more than 20.\nRow 8: Peru State College with 2 titles. Again, under 20.\nRow 9: York College has 28 titles. That's way above 20.\n\nSo from this, only York College exceeds 20 national titles with 28. All other schools have fewer than or equal to 19. \n\nWait a second, let me double-check Nebraska Wesleyan University because they have 19, which is just below 20. So no, they don't qualify as having more than 20.\n\nTherefore, the claim that only York College has won more than 20 titles seems correct based on the data provided. There's no other school in the table with over 20 titles except York College.\n\nSo the relevant cells are the \"national titles\" column for each row because I checked all of them to ensure only York College meets the condition. Specifically, each row's \"national titles\" value was examined to confirm whether it exceeds 20.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as only York College has more than 20 national titles.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"with a total of 0, the lowest number of national title belongs to the college of saint mary.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It's saying two things: that College of Saint Mary has 0 national titles and that this is the lowest number among all the schools listed.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a school with various attributes including 'national titles'. I need to check each school's national titles to verify both parts of the claim.\n\nStarting with the first part: Does College of Saint Mary have 0 national titles? Yes, according to Row 2, under 'national titles' it is listed as 0. So that checks out.\n\nNext, I need to confirm if 0 is indeed the lowest number across all schools. Let's go through each row:\n\n- Bellevue University: 14 titles\n- College of Saint Mary: 0 titles (as mentioned)\n- Concordia University: 1 title\n- Doane College: 10 titles\n- Hastings College: 3 titles\n- Midland University: 2 titles\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University: 19 titles\n- Peru State College: 2 titles\n- York College: 28 titles\n\nLooking at all these numbers, the smallest number is indeed 0. So the claim that College of Saint Mary has the lowest number with 0 national titles is correct.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because College of Saint Mary has 0 national titles, which is the lowest among all schools listed.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table to understand the data structure. There are nine rows, each representing a different school with details about their mascot, conference, number of national titles, and founding year.\n\nThe claim states that Bellevue University is the youngest based on its founding date. Since \"youngest\" refers to the most recently founded, I need to check which school was founded last. That means looking at the 'founded' column for each row and finding the highest (most recent) year.\n\nLet me list out the schools along with their founding years:\n\n1. Bellevue University: 1966\n2. College of Saint Mary: 1923\n3. Concordia University: 1894\n4. Doane College: 1872\n5. Hastings College: 1882\n6. Midland University: 1883\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887\n8. Peru State College: 1865\n9. York College: 1890\n\nLooking at these years, the most recent founding year is 1966 for Bellevue University. Comparing this with all others, it's indeed the highest. For example, the next closest are Nebraska Wesleyan in 1887 and Midland in 1883, both much earlier than 1966.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Bellevue University is the youngest based on founding date holds true because it was founded in 1966, which is later than all other listed schools.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"the bellevue bruin be the only nebraska team to play in the midland conference\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the table to understand its structure and content. The table has nine rows, each representing a different school with details about their mascot, conference, national titles, and founding year. \n\nThe claim mentions two key points: \n1. Bellevue Bruins are in the Midlands Conference.\n2. They are the only Nebraska team in that conference.\n\nSo, I need to verify both parts of this statement using the table data.\n\nLooking at the first row:\n- School: Bellevue University\n- Mascot: Bellevue Bruins\n- Conference: Midlands\n\nThis confirms that Bellevue Bruins (from Bellevue University) are indeed part of the Midlands Conference. So the first condition is satisfied.\n\nNext, I need to check if there are any other Nebraska teams in the same conference. Let's go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Already confirmed as Bellevue Bruins in Midlands.\nRow 2: College of Saint Mary, mascot Saint Mary Flames, Conference: Midlands. This is another team in the Midlands Conference. The school name doesn't specify a location, but since it's listed alongside other Nebraska schools, we can assume it's from Nebraska unless stated otherwise. So this is another team in the same conference.\nRow 3: Concordia University - Conference: Great Plains\nRow 4: Doane College - Conference: Great Plains\nRow 5: Hastings College - Conference: Great Plains\nRow 6: Midland University - Conference: Great Plains\nRow 7: Nebraska Wesleyan University - Conference: Great Plains\nRow 8: Peru State College - Conference: Midlands. Again, this is another team in the Midlands Conference.\nRow 9: York College - Conference: Midlands. Yet another team in the same conference.\n\nSo, besides Bellevue Bruins, there are at least three other teams in the Midlands Conference: Saint Mary Flames, Peru State Bobcats, and York Panthers. All of these appear to be Nebraska schools based on their names.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Bellevue Bruins are the only Nebraska team in the Midlands Conference is false because there are multiple other teams from Nebraska in that conference.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there are other Nebraska teams like College of Saint Mary, Peru State College, and York College also in the Midlands Conference. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"conference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"conference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"conference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"conference\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"peru state college be the last institution found in the 19th century\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. It says that Peru State College was the last institution founded in the 19th century. So, I need to find out which institutions were founded in the 19th century and check their founding years to see if Peru State College has the latest (most recent) year among them.\n\nLooking at the table, each row lists a school with its mascot, conference, number of national titles, and founding year. The relevant columns here are \"school\" and \"founded.\"\n\nI'll go through each row and note down the schools along with their founding years:\n\n1. Bellevue University - 1966\n2. College of Saint Mary - 1923\n3. Concordia University - 1894\n4. Doane College - 1872\n5. Hastings College - 1882\n6. Midland University - 1883\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University - 1887\n8. Peru State College - 1865\n9. York College - 1890\n\nNow, I'll focus only on the schools founded in the 19th century. The 19th century spans from 1801 to 1900. So any school with a founding year between these dates is relevant.\n\nLet's list those:\n\n- Concordia University: 1894\n- Doane College: 1872\n- Hastings College: 1882\n- Midland University: 1883\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887\n- Peru State College: 1865\n- York College: 1890\n\nFrom this list, I need to find which school was founded last. To do that, I'll arrange these years in order from earliest to latest:\n\nPeru State College: 1865  \nDoane College: 1872  \nHastings College: 1882  \nMidland University: 1883  \nNebraska Wesleyan University: 1887  \nYork College: 1890  \nConcordia University: 1894  \n\nLooking at this order, the latest founding year is 1894 for Concordia University. Therefore, Concordia University was founded in 1894, which is later than Peru State College's 1865.\n\nWait a minute\u2014hold on. The claim says that Peru State College is the last institution found in the 19th century. But according to this analysis, Concordia University was founded later than Peru State College within the 19th century. So, if we're looking for the \"last\" (i.e., most recent) founding year in the 19th century among these schools, it would be Concordia University, not Peru State College.\n\nBut wait again\u2014am I misreading something? The claim says \"peru state college be the last institution found in the 19th century.\" So according to the data, the latest founding is 1894 for Concordia. That's later than Peru's 1865. Therefore, the claim would be FALSE because another school (Concordia) was founded after Peru State College within the same century.\n\nHowever, perhaps I should double-check if there are any other schools with a later founding year in the table. Looking again:\n\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887\n- York College: 1890\n- Concordia University: 1894\n\nYes, so 1894 is later than Peru's 1865. Therefore, Peru State College was not the last institution founded in the 19th century among these schools.\n\nWait\u2014am I considering all the rows? Let me list all founded years again:\n\nRow 3: Concordia University - 1894  \nRow 4: Doane College - 1872  \nRow 5: Hastings College - 1882  \nRow 6: Midland University - 1883  \nRow 7: Nebraska Wesleyan University - 1887  \nRow 8: Peru State College - 1865  \nRow 9: York College - 1890  \n\nSo, the highest founding year is 1894 for Concordia. Therefore, the claim that Peru State College was the last (most recent) institution founded in the 19th century is incorrect.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE because there's at least one school (Concordia University) founded after Peru State College within the same century.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Peru State College was the last institution founded in the 19th century. However, based on the table, Concordia University was founded in 1894, which is later than Peru State College's founding year of 1865.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"only 2 school, york college and peru state college, have win more than 20 time.\" So, first, I need to understand what this means. It seems like the user is saying that only two schools\u2014York College and Peru State College\u2014have won more than 20 national titles each.\n\nLooking at the table, there are nine rows of data about different colleges. Each row includes information about the school name, mascot, conference, number of national titles, and founding year.\n\nTo verify this claim, I need to focus on the \"school\" and \"national titles\" columns for each row. The goal is to check which schools have more than 20 national titles.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Bellevue University**: National Titles = 14 \u2192 Not more than 20.\n2. **College of Saint Mary**: National Titles = 0 \u2192 Definitely not.\n3. **Concordia University**: National Titles = 1 \u2192 No.\n4. **Doane College**: National Titles = 10 \u2192 Still under 20.\n5. **Hastings College**: National Titles = 3 \u2192 Nope.\n6. **Midland University**: National Titles = 2 \u2192 Not there yet.\n7. **Nebraska Wesleyan University**: National Titles = 19 \u2192 Hmm, just shy of 20.\n8. **Peru State College**: National Titles = 2 \u2192 Wait, the claim says Peru State has more than 20, but here it's only 2.\n9. **York College**: National Titles = 28 \u2192 This is over 20.\n\nWait a second, according to the table, York College has 28 national titles, which is indeed more than 20. However, Peru State College only has 2 national titles, not more than 20. So the claim incorrectly states that Peru State College has won more than 20 times when actually it hasn't.\n\nAdditionally, looking at Nebraska Wesleyan University, they have 19 national titles, which is close but still under 20. So only York College meets the criteria of having more than 20 national titles.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because only one school (York College) has won more than 20 times, and Peru State College hasn't reached that number.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that only York College and Peru State College have over 20 national titles.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the college of saint mary hold the highest number of national title\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the relevant information in the table. The claim mentions \"college of saint mary,\" so I should find that row first. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 2: school: college of saint mary, mascot: saint mary flames, conference: midlands, national titles: 0, founded: 1923.\n\nSo according to this, the college has 0 national titles.\n\nNext, I need to check the number of national titles for all other schools in the table to see if any have a higher or lower count. Let's list them out:\n\n- Bellevue University (Row 1): 14\n- College of Saint Mary (Row 2): 0\n- Concordia University (Row 3): 1\n- Doane College (Row 4): 10\n- Hastings College (Row 5): 3\n- Midland University (Row 6): 2\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University (Row 7): 19\n- Peru State College (Row 8): 2\n- York College (Row 9): 28\n\nNow, the highest number here is 28 from York College. Since college of saint mary has 0, which is much lower than others like York with 28, the claim that they hold the highest number is clearly false.\n\nSo, I can conclude that the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cells are the national titles for each school to compare their counts.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that college of saint mary has the highest national titles, but in reality, York College has 28, which is much higher.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"bellevue university be the first college found in the 20th century\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It's stating that Bellevue University was the first college founded in the 20th century. To verify this, I need to look at the founding years of all colleges listed and see if Bellevue University has the earliest year within the 20th century range (1901-2000).\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Bellevue University was founded in 1966.\nNow, I'll check the other rows to find any college founded before 1966 but still in the 20th century.\n\nRow 2: College of Saint Mary - Founded in 1923. That's earlier than 1966 and within the 20th century.\nRow 4: Doane College - Founded in 1872 (19th century).\nRow 5: Hastings College - 1882, also 19th century.\nRow 6: Midland University - 1883, still 19th century.\nRow 7: Nebraska Wesleyan University - 1887, same as above.\nRow 8: Peru State College - Founded in 1865 (19th century).\nRow 9: York College - 1890, also 19th century.\n\nSo among all the colleges listed, Bellevue University was founded in 1966, but there are others like College of Saint Mary (1923) and Peru State College (1865). Wait, actually, Peru State is before 1900, so it's not part of the 20th century. So the earliest in the 20th century would be College of Saint Mary at 1923, which is earlier than Bellevue's 1966.\n\nTherefore, Bellevue University isn't the first college founded in the 20th century; that title goes to College of Saint Mary. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Bellevue University's founding year (Row 1, Founded)\n- College of Saint Mary's founding year (Row 2, Founded) because it shows an earlier date within the 20th century.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
