    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the claim about Kristofer Martin's nominations and wins in 2012 is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"kristofer martin be nominate for 3 act award in 2012 , win the german moreno youth achievement award\". It seems there are two main points here:\n\n1. Kristofer Martin was nominated for three acting awards in 2012.\n2. He won the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award in 2012.\n\nI need to verify each part against the table data.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll focus on rows where the year is 2012. There are four such rows (rows 4, 5, 6, and 7). Let's go through them one by one.\n\nRow 4: Award giving body - The Young Critics Circle Awards, Category - Best Performance, Nominated for - Oros, Result - Nominated.\nRow 5: Award giving body - 28th PMPc Star Awards for Movies, Category - New Movie Actor of the Year, Nominated for - Tween Academy: Class of 2012, Result - Nominated.\nRow 6: Award giving body - FAMAS Awards, Category - German Moreno Youth Achievement Award, Nominated for - N/A, Result - Won.\nRow 7: Award giving body - 1st Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards, Category - Most Liked Loveteam with Joyce Ching, Nominated for - N/A, Result - Won.\n\nNow, let's check the nominations. The claim states he was nominated for three acting awards. Let me count the number of times he was nominated in 2012:\n\n- Row 4: Nominated (Best Performance)\n- Row 5: Nominated (New Movie Actor of the Year)\n\nSo that's two nominations, not three. There are only two instances where he was nominated for acting awards in 2012.\n\nNext, regarding the award won: The claim mentions winning the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award. Looking at row 6, the result is \"won\" for that specific award. So this part checks out.\n\nHowever, since the first part of the claim about being nominated for three acting awards isn't accurate (only two nominations), the entire claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states Kristofer Martin was nominated for three acting awards in 2012 and won the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award. The table shows only two nominations and one win, making the claim FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"In 2013, Kristofer Martin received only an honorable mention for Best Supporting Actor in 'Oros' at the 16th Long Island International Film Expo, but won Best Actor in a Supporting Role for 'Oros' at the 10th Golden Screen Awards.\"\n\nI'll break this down into two parts:\n\n1. Did Kristofer Martin receive an honorable mention for Best Supporting Actor in 'Oros' at the 16th L.I.I.F.E. in 2013?\n2. Did he win Best Actor in a Supporting Role for 'Oros' at the 10th Golden Screen Awards in 2013?\n\nNow, looking at the table:\n\nRow 2: Year 2013, Award body is 16th L.I.I.F.E., Category is Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor, Nominated For: Oros, Result: Won.\n\nWait a minute, that's conflicting. The claim says he received an honorable mention but the table shows \"won\" for that award. So according to the table, he actually won that category, not just received an honorable mention.\n\nRow 3: Year 2013, Award body is 10th Golden Screen Awards, Category: Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Nominated For: Oros, Result: Won.\n\nSo for the second part of the claim, he did win at the Golden Screen Awards. But the first part says he only got an honorable mention, which isn't correct because the table shows he won that award.\n\nTherefore, since one part of the claim is incorrect (he actually won, not just received a mention), the entire claim isn't accurate. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Kristofer Martin only received an honorable mention at the 16th L.I.I.F.E., when in fact he won. The rest of the details about winning at the Golden Screen Awards are correct, but the first part is wrong.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"category\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"2 of the award wins by Kristofer Martin between 2012 and 2013 were not based on nomination for a specific show.\" \n\nFirst, let's parse each part of the claim. I'm looking for two awards that Kristofer won where he wasn't nominated for a specific show. So, I need to check which rows in the table have \"result\" as \"won,\" and then see if those wins had a \"nominated for\" value that isn't linked to a specific show or performance.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Result is \"nominated.\" Doesn't count as a win. So, skip.\nRow 2: Won the award for \"Oros\" in the category of Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor. The \"nominated for\" column has \"Oros,\" which seems to be a specific show or role. So this might not count towards the claim because it's based on a specific nomination.\nRow 3: Also won, but again nominated for \"Oros.\" Same as above.\nRow 4: Nominated, so not a win. Skip.\nRow 5: Nominated, not a win. Skip.\nRow 6: Won the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award at the Famas Awards. The \"nominated for\" is listed as \"N/A,\" which suggests there was no specific nomination tied to it. This could be one of the two required wins without a specific show nomination.\nRow 7: Won the Most Liked Loveteam award with Joyce Ching. The \"nominated for\" is also \"N/A.\" So this would be the second win without a specific nomination.\n\nSo, rows 6 and 7 are both wins where Kristofer Martin didn't have a specific show or performance he was nominated for. That makes two awards as per the claim. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table with several rows of data about award nominations and wins, specifically mentioning Kristofer Martin. The claim is that \"3 of Kristofer Martin's award nomination[s] be for his performance in oros.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. Each row represents an award event from different years (2012 and 2013) with details like the awarding body, category, what he was nominated for, and the result.\n\nThe key here is to identify how many times Kristofer Martin was nominated specifically for his role in \"Oros.\" The claim states that three of his nominations were for this performance. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Year 2013, award body is 1st Sunday All Stars Awards, category Standout Season Performer. He wasn't nominated for anything here since it says \"nominated for: none.\" So, this doesn't count towards the claim.\n\n2. **Row 2**: Year 2013, Long Island International Film Expo, category Honorable Mention Best Supporting Actor. Here, he was nominated for \"Oros\" and won. That's one nomination for \"Oros.\"\n\n3. **Row 3**: Again in 2013, Golden Screen Awards, Best Actor in a Supporting Role, nominated for \"Oros,\" also a win. This is the second nomination.\n\n4. **Row 4**: Year 2012, Young Critics Circle Awards, category Best Performance, nominated for \"Oros.\" However, it says he was just nominated, not won. That's the third nomination for \"Oros.\"\n\n5. **Row 5**: 2012, PMPc Star Awards, New Movie Actor of the Year, nominated for \"Tween Academy: Class of 2012.\" This is a different project, so it doesn't count.\n\n6. **Row 6**: FAMAS Awards in 2012, German Moreno Youth Achievement Award. The nomination is listed as N/A, which might mean he was acknowledged without a specific role mentioned or perhaps it's an achievement award not tied to a particular performance. Either way, it doesn't specify \"Oros,\" so this doesn't count.\n\n7. **Row 7**: Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards, category is Most Liked Loveteam with Joyce Ching. The nomination is N/A here as well, and it's about being liked rather than a performance role in a movie or show. So, not relevant to \"Oros.\"\n\nSumming up the nominations for \"Oros,\" we have three instances: Rows 2, 3, and 4. Each of these has \"nominated for: oros\" as per the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, mapping this to the required JSON output. The relevant cells are in rows 1, 2, and 4 (since indexing starts at 0). Wait, no\u2014Row 1 isn't relevant because it's not about \"Oros.\" So only Rows 1 is index 0? Let me double-check:\n\n- Row 1: Index 0\n- Row 2: Index 1\n- Row 3: Index 2\n- Row 4: Index 3\n\nBut looking back, the claim counts three nominations for \"Oros,\" which are in Rows 2 (index 1), 3 (index 2), and 4 (index 3). So relevant cells would include the 'nominated for' column in these rows.\n\nThus, the JSON should list row indices 1, 2, and 3 with the column name \"nominated for\" each. This accurately reflects where the information confirming the nominations for \"Oros\" is found.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Kristofer Martin is true or false based on the given table. The claim says he was nominated for 7 acting awards between 2012 and 2013 and won 4 of them. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, there are seven rows with information about different award nominations and results from 2012 and 2013. I need to check each row to see if Kristofer Martin was nominated or won any awards in acting categories during those years.\n\nLet's go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Year 2013, award body is 1st Sunday All Stars Awards, category Stand Out Season Performer. It says he was \"nominated.\" So that's a nomination for an acting-related award.\n\nRow 2: 2013, Long Island International Film Expo, Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor. He was nominated and won this one. So another nomination, and a win here.\n\nRow 3: 2013, Golden Screen Awards, Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Nominated for Oros and he won. That's another nomination and another win.\n\nRow 4: 2012, Young Critics Circle Awards, Best Performance. He was nominated but didn't win. So that's another nomination.\n\nRow 5: 2012, PMPc Star Awards for Movies, New Movie Actor of the Year. Nominated for Tween Academy: Class of 2012 and he was nominated. That's a fifth nomination.\n\nWait, but hold on. The claim is about acting awards. I need to check if each award category is related to acting. Let me see:\n\n- Stand Out Season Performer (Row 1): that sounds like acting.\n- Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor (Row 2): definitely acting.\n- Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Row 3): yes, acting.\n- Best Performance (Row 4): likely acting.\n- New Movie Actor of the Year (Row 5): that's about being a new actor, so acting.\n- German Moreno Youth Achievement Award (Row 6): this seems to be a specific award for youth achievement, not necessarily acting. So I'm unsure if this counts as an acting award.\n- Most Liked Loveteam with Joyce Ching (Row 7): this is more about popularity in a team, likely not an acting award.\n\nSo Rows 1,2,3,4,5 are related to acting. That's five nominations so far. Wait, the claim says 7 nominations. So maybe I'm missing some.\n\nWait, Row 6 and 7: if they're not acting awards, then Kristofer Martin only has 5 acting-related nominations between 2012-2013. The claim says 7, so that would make it false because he's only nominated for 5, not 7.\n\nWait, but looking back at the table:\n\nRow 6: FAMAS Awards, category German Moreno Youth Achievement Award. That's a specific award given by FAMAS to recognize youth achievement in cinema. I think this is an acting-related award since it's about young actors' achievements. So that would be another nomination.\n\nSo now we have six nominations.\n\nRow 7: Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards, category Most Liked Loveteam with Joyce Ching. This seems to be more of a popularity award for being liked as a team in a love story or something, not an acting award per se. So I wouldn't count this towards the 7 acting nominations.\n\nWait, but let's double-check all rows again:\n\nRow 1: Nominated - yes, acting.\nRow 2: Won - acting.\nRow 3: Won - acting.\nRow 4: Nominated - acting.\nRow 5: Nominated - acting.\nRow 6: Nominated? Wait, in Row 6, it says \"nominated for: n/a\" and result is won. So he was nominated for the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award and won it. That's another nomination (acting-related).\n\nSo that makes six nominations:\n\n1. Row1: Nom\n2. Row2: Nom\n3. Row3: Nom\n4. Row4: Nom\n5. Row5: Nom\n6. Row6: Won (but also a nomination)\n\nWait, but in the table, for each row, if result is 'won', does that mean he was nominated? Yes, because to win you have to be nominated first.\n\nSo total acting-related nominations:\n\nRow1: nom - 1\nRow2: nom and won - 2\nRow3: nom and won -3\nRow4: nom -4\nRow5: nom -5\nRow6: nom (since he won) -6\n\nWait, but Row7 is Most Liked Loveteam. That's not acting, so only 6 nominations.\n\nBut the claim says 7. Hmm, maybe I missed something. Let me count again:\n\n- Rows where category is acting-related and result includes 'nominated' or 'won'.\n\nRow1: Nominated - yes\nRow2: Won (so nominated) - yes\nRow3: Won (so nominated) - yes\nRow4: Nominated - yes\nRow5: Nominated - yes\nRow6: Won (so nominated) - yes\n\nThat's 6 nominations. The claim says 7, so that would make the number of nominations incorrect.\n\nNow, about the wins: how many did he win?\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow1: result is 'nominated' - no win.\nRow2: won\nRow3: won\nRow4: nominated - no win\nRow5: nominated - no win\nRow6: won\n\nSo that's three wins (Rows 2,3,6).\n\nBut the claim says he won 4 of those awards. So according to this, it would be false because he only won 3.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check each row again:\n\n- Row1: Nominated - no win\n- Row2: Won - count 1\n- Row3: Won - count 2\n- Row4: Nominated - no\n- Row5: Nominated - no\n- Row6: Won - count 3\n- Row7: Doesn't count as acting.\n\nSo total wins: 3. But the claim says he won 4 awards out of 7 nominations. So both numbers are incorrect: 6 nominations instead of 7, and 3 wins instead of 4.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Kristofer Martin had six acting-related nominations (2012-2013) with three wins, not seven nominations and four wins as claimed.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"reasoning\": \"Kristofer Martin received six acting-related nominations between 2012 and 2013, winning three awards. The claim of seven nominations and four wins is incorrect.\"\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"kristofer martin be only nominate for 1 act award in 2013 but didn't win any\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding each part of the claim.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions Kristofer Martin being nominated for only one acting award in 2013 and not winning any. So I need to check two things: the number of nominations he had in 2013 and whether he won any awards that year.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different award entry. The years mentioned are 2013 and 2012 across all rows. Since the claim is about 2013, I'll focus on rows where the year is 2013.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Year 2013, Award Giving Body is 1st Sunday All Stars Awards. The category is Stand Out Season Performer. He was nominated for \"none\" and the result is \"nominated.\" So this counts as a nomination in 2013.\n\nRow 2: Also 2013, award body is 16th Long Island International Film Expo. Category is Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor. Nominated for \"oros,\" and the result is \"won.\" Wait, so he won this award. That's a win in 2013.\n\nRow 3: Again 2013, Golden Screen Awards. Category Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Nominated for \"oros\" and result is \"won.\" Another win here.\n\nSo from 2013, Kristofer Martin was nominated in two categories (Rows 1 and 2) but actually won both awards in Rows 2 and 3. But wait, Row 1's nomination didn't lead to a win. So he had at least one nomination without a win, but also other nominations where he did win.\n\nWait, the claim says he was only nominated once but didn't win any. That doesn't match because according to Rows 2 and 3, he won two awards in 2013. Therefore, the claim is false on both counts: more than one nomination and winning some awards.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states Kristofer Martin was nominated for only one acting award in 2013 and didn't win any, but the table shows multiple nominations and wins.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The category here is Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor, nominated for Oros, and he won this award.\n\nWait, but the claim says he received two honorable mentions. Hmm. Let me check if there's another entry from 2013 with the same award body or category.\n\nLooking through all rows for year 2013:\n\n- Row 1: Different award body (1st Sunday All Stars Awards), different category.\n- Row 2: As above, won Honorable Mention.\n- Row 3: Another 2013 entry from Golden Screen Awards. The category here is Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Oros, and he also won this.\n\nSo, in 2013, Kristofer Martin has two wins:\n\n1. At the 16th Long Island International Film Expo: Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor.\n2. At the 10th Golden Screen Awards: Best Actor in a Supporting Role.\n\nThe claim mentions \"two honorable mentions\" at the same award body (Long Island). But according to the table, he only has one entry there with that category and result as 'won'. There's no second honorable mention for the same award. Therefore, the part about receiving two honorable mentions is incorrect.\n\nAdditionally, regarding the FAMAS Award in 2013: Checking the rows, I don't see any entries from 2013 under FAMAS. The only FAMAS entry is in 2012 (Row 6). So, there's no record of him winning Best Actor in a Supporting Role at FAMAS in 2013.\n\nTherefore, the claim has two inaccuracies: it incorrectly states he received two honorable mentions and claims a win at FAMAS in 2013 which didn't happen.

He wasn't nominated for anything specific here\u2014it says \"none\". So this nomination isn't related to \"oros\".\n\nRows 2 and 3: Both in 2013, he was nominated for \"oros\" and won both. These are relevant because they directly mention \"oros\".\n\nRow 4: In 2012, the award is from the young critics circle awards, category best performance, nominated for \"oros\". So this is another nomination related to \"oros\".\n\nRows 5-7: \n- Row 5: Award body pmpc star awards, category new movie actor of the year, nominated for \"tween academy: class of 2012\". Not related.\n- Row 6: Famas awards, category german moreno youth achievement award. Nominated for n/a. So no specific performance mentioned here, but it's not \"oros\".\n- Row 7: Party pilipinas most liked awards, category most liked loveteam with joyce ching. Again, not related to acting in a movie or \"oros\".\n\nSo the claim says all his nominations are for \"oros\". However, rows 1 and 5 have nominations that aren't for \"oros\", and row 6 has no specific nomination but might be unrelated. Therefore, the claim isn't entirely true because not all of his nominations were for \"oros\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim about Kristofer Martin is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim: \"kristofer martin have be nominate for 7 best actor award between 2012 and 2013, win 4 of those award.\" \n\nFirst, I should check if the years mentioned are covered in the table\u2014yes, rows 1 to 6 cover 2012 and 2013. Now, let's go through each row to see which awards relate to acting categories.\n\nRow 1: Year 2013, award giving body is 1st Sunday All Stars Awards, category Stand out Season Performer. The nominee isn't listed as Kristofer Martin since \"nominated for\" is none. So this might not be relevant unless the name is missing. But the table doesn\u2019t specify his nomination here.\n\nRow 2: Year 2013, award body 16th Long Island International Film Expo, category Honorable Mention Best Supporting Actor. Nominated for \"Oros.\" Result is won. So that's one win.\n\nRow 3: Year 2013, Golden Screen Awards, Best Actor in a Supporting Role, nominated for Oros. Won again. Second win here.\n\nRow 4: 2012, Young Critics Circle Awards, Best Performance, nominated for Oros. Result is nominated. So that's a nomination but no win.\n\nRow 5: 2012, PMPc Star Awards for Movies, New Movie Actor of the Year, nominated for \"Tween Academy.\" Result is nominated. Another nomination.\n\nRow 6: 2012, FAMAS Awards, German Moreno Youth Achievement Award. Nominated for n/a, result won. So that's a third win? Wait, but this category isn't specifically Best Actor; it's about youth achievement. Maybe not counted as a Best Actor award?\n\nWait, the claim is about \"best actor\" awards. The categories are: Stand out Season Performer (Row1), Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor (Row2), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Row3), Best Performance (Row4), New Movie Actor of the Year (Row5). So Rows 2, 3, and maybe 4 could be considered acting awards. Row6 is more about achievement rather than best actor specifically.\n\nSo let's count nominations first: How many times was he nominated? \n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row1: Nominated but not for any specific person listed (nominated for none). Maybe that doesn't count as his nomination.\n- Row2: Won, so he was nominated.\n- Row3: Won, so nominated.\n- Row4: Nominated, result is nominated.\n- Row5: Nominated, result is nominated.\n- Rows 6 and 7 don't relate to acting awards.\n\nSo total nominations from acting categories are Rows2,3,4,5\u2014four nominations. But the claim says seven nominations between 2012-2013. That doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check each row again:\n\nRow1: Year 2013, award body 1st Sunday All Stars Awards, category Stand out Season Performer. Nominated for none\u2014maybe that's not a nomination for Kristofer.\n\nRows2-7: For acting categories:\n\nRow2: Won (nominated)\nRow3: Won (nominated)\nRow4: Nominated\nRow5: Nominated\n\nThat's four nominations in total, two wins. But the claim says he was nominated seven times and won four. So clearly, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The table might not list all his nominations because it only shows specific rows. Maybe there are more rows or the table is incomplete? Or maybe some of these categories count differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is incorrect because in the given data, he has four nominations (Rows2-5) but only two wins. So the claim says seven nominations and four wins\u2014both numbers don't match.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states Kristofer Martin was nominated for 7 Best Actor awards between 2012-2013 and won 4. However, the table shows only 4 relevant nominations (Rows2-5) with 2 wins (Rows2,3). Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"award giving body\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"award giving body\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"award giving body\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"award giving body\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"category\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"all of the award wins by Kristofer Martin between 2012 and 2013 be based on nomination for a specific show.\"\n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided and check each row where Kristofer Martin won an award in those years. Let me go through each relevant row.\n\nRow 2: In 2013, he was nominated for \"oros\" under the category of honorable mention for best supporting actor, and he won. So here, the nomination is for a specific show or role, which fits the claim.\n\nRow 3: Again in 2013, he was nominated for \"oros\" in the best actor in a supporting role category, and he won. This also seems to be based on a specific show or role.\n\nRow 6: In 2012, he won an award at the FAMAS Awards under the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award category. The nomination was for \"n/a,\" which probably means there wasn't a specific show or performance it was tied to\u2014it's more of an achievement award rather than being based on a particular show.\n\nRow 7: Also in 2012, he won at the 1st Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards for being the most liked loveteam with Joyce Ching. The nomination here is also \"n/a,\" suggesting it wasn't tied to a specific show but perhaps more of a popularity award.\n\nSo looking at rows 6 and 7, the awards were won without a specific show nomination. That means not all his wins between 2012-2013 were based on nominations for specific shows. Therefore, the claim is false because some of his wins weren't tied to a particular show but rather to other categories or achievements.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all awards won by Kristofer Martin in 2012 and 2013 were based on nominations for specific shows. However, rows 6 and 7 show that he won awards without being nominated for a specific show.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
