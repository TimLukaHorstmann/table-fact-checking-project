    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the home game of essendon have a small crowd of 12865\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find the one where Essendon is the home team. \n\nLooking at Row 3: Home team is Essendon, away team is Fitzroy, venue is Windy Hill, and the crowd size is 12865. The date for this game is 28 August 1971.\n\nThe claim mentions a \"small crowd.\" I'll compare the crowd number with others in the table to gauge if it's small. \n\nLooking at all rows:\n- Row 1: 14,809\n- Row 2: 16,707\n- Row 3: 12,865 (Essendon)\n- Row 4: 32,000\n- Row 5: 9,307\n- Row 6: 36,423\n\nRow 5 has the smallest crowd at 9,307. Essendon's crowd is higher than that but lower than Rows 1 and 2. However, compared to Rows 4 and 6, which are significantly larger, 12,865 seems small.\n\nBut the claim specifically says \"small.\" Since Row 5 has a smaller number than Essendon's, it might not be considered the smallest. Alternatively, if \"small\" is subjective, but in the context of these numbers, 12k could be seen as relatively low compared to 32k and above.\n\nThus, the crowd size for Essendon's home game being 12,865 aligns with a small number relative to others on the same date. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Essendon's home game had a small crowd of 12,865. Checking Row 3 confirms the crowd size matches, and while not the smallest in the table, it can be considered relatively small compared to other games on the same date.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's see what I need to do here. The task is to determine whether a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table has several rows with different details about football matches. The claim given is: \"on august 28 1971 hawthorn score 18.16 at the glenferrie oval.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its key components to check against the table.\n\n1. **Date**: August 28, 1971\n2. **Home Team**: Hawthorn\n3. **Score**: 18.16\n4. **Venue**: Glenferrie Oval\n\nNow, I'll go through each row of the table provided to see if all these conditions match.\n\nLooking at Row 1:\n- Home team: Hawthorn (matches)\n- Date: August 28, 1971 (matches)\n- Score: 18.16 (this is under \"home team score,\" which matches the claim)\n- Venue: Glenferrie Oval (also matches)\n\nSo, all parts of the claim are present in Row 1. Each component from the claim corresponds exactly to the data in that row. There's no discrepancy here.\n\nI'll also quickly check other rows just to make sure there isn't any conflicting information, but since each row has a different date or teams, they don't interfere with this particular claim. \n\nTherefore, every part of the claim is supported by Row 1 of the table.

The claim says: \"14.18 be the score for the away team while the home team score point of 16.14\". \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the table to see which ones have an away team score of 14.18 and a corresponding home team score of 16.14.\n\nLooking at Row 1: The away team is Melbourne with a score of 8.17 (65). That's not 14.18, so this row doesn't match.\n\nRow 2: Away team St Kilda scored 12.18 (90). Still not 14.18. So move on.\n\nRow 3: Fitzroy is the away team with 13.17 (95). Again, not matching.\n\nRow 4: Collingwood as the away team has 13.9 (87). Not the score we're looking for.\n\nRow 5: North Melbourne's score is 8.11 (59).

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"when the home team score 17.16 , the game be play at glenferrie oval\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asking. It states that if a home team scores 17.16, then the venue of the game should be Glenferrie Oval. So, I need to check two things for each row in the table: the home team score and the venue.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows, each representing a different game on August 28, 1971. Each row has details about the home team, their score, the away team, their score, the venue, crowd numbers, and the date.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to see if any of them have a home team score of 17.16 and then check what the venue was for that game.\n\nRow 1: Home team is Hawthorn with a score of 18.16 (which totals 124 points). The venue here is Glenferrie Oval, but the home score isn't 17.16\u2014it's higher at 18.16.\n\nRow 2: Footscray is the home team scoring 10.14 (74 points), so that doesn't match either. They played at Western Oval.\n\nRow 3: Essendon, the home team, scored 12.12 (84 points). The venue was Windy Hill, which isn't Glenferrie Oval, and the score is lower than claimed.\n\nRow 4: Carlton's score is 16.10 (106 points) at Princes Park. Still not matching the 17.16 claim.\n\nRow 5: South Melbourne scored 19.17 (131 points) against North Melbourne at Lake Oval. Again, the home team score here is higher than 17.16 and venue isn't Glenferrie.\n\nRow 6: Richmond's score was 16.14 (110 points), so that's not matching either. They played at the MCG.\n\nAfter checking all six rows, I notice that none of the home teams scored exactly 17.16. The closest is Hawthorn in Row 1 with 18.16, but their score was higher. Therefore, there's no instance where a home team scored 17.16 at Glenferrie Oval.\n\nHence, the claim doesn't hold true based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that when a home team scores 17.16, the game is played at Glenferrie Oval. However, reviewing all rows in the table, no home team has a score of exactly 17.16. The closest is Row 1 with a score of 18.16, but the venue for that game was indeed Glenferrie Oval.\n\nBut since the claim specifically mentions a home team score of 17.16, which doesn't exist in any row, the statement isn't supported by the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the away team score 14.18 points when the home team score 17.14 points.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into two parts:\n1. There's a game where the away team scored 14.18 (which converts to 102 points).\n2. In that same game, the home team must have scored 17.14 (which is 118 points).\n\nLooking at each row of the table:\n\nRow 1: Away team score is 8.17 (65) and home team is 18.16 (124). Doesn't match.\nRow 2: Away team scored higher, but not 14.18.\nRow 3: Again, away team scored more, but not the specified points.\nRow 4: Home team Carlton scored 16.10 (106), which is close to 17.14 but not exact.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the smallest crowd at a home game for essendon be 10865\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look for Essendon's games in the table since the claim is about their home games. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 3 mentions Essendon as the home team. Their score is 12.12 (84), and the away team is Fitzroy with a score of 13.17 (95). The venue is Windy Hill, and the crowd size is 12865 on August 28, 1971.\n\nNow, the claim states that the smallest crowd at a home game for Essendon was 10865. But according to the table, in this particular game, the crowd was 12865. I need to check if there are any other games where Essendon was the home team because maybe there's another row with a smaller crowd.\n\nLooking through all six rows, only Row 3 lists Essendon as the home team. There are no other entries for Essendon in this table. So, based on the given data, their only recorded home game had a crowd of 12865.\n\nThe claim mentions \"smallest crowd,\" but there's only one entry. Therefore, if we take this data at face value, 12865 would be both the smallest and only crowd figure for Essendon's home games in this table. The claim states 10865, which doesn't match the given number.\n\nWait a second, maybe I should double-check if there's any other row where Essendon is the home team that I might have missed. Let me go through each row again:\n\n- Row 1: Hawthorn vs Melbourne\n- Row 2: Footscray vs St Kilda\n- Row 3: Essendon vs Fitzroy\n- Row 4: Carlton vs Collingwood\n- Row 5: South Melbourne vs North Melbourne\n- Row 6: Richmond vs Geelong\n\nNo, only Row 3 has Essendon as the home team. Therefore, there's no other crowd number to compare. Since the claim says 10865 and the table shows 12865 for their home game, the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because the crowd number doesn't match. The relevant cell here is in Row 3 under 'crowd'.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Essendon's smallest home crowd was 10865, but according to the table, their only recorded home game had a crowd of 12865.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
