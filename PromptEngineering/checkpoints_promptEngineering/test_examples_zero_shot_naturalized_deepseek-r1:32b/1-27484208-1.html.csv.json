    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"it may come as a surprise, but dartmouth college rank higher than the university of t\u00fcbingen\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure provided. It has six rows, each representing a different university with details like members (name), country, year established, and various world rankings from 2013 by wur, arwu, and qs.\n\nThe claim is comparing Dartmouth College and University of T\u00fcbingen in terms of their ranks. So I need to find the relevant rows for each institution.\n\nLooking at Row 1: members are Dartmouth College. The ranking details here include:\n- wur: 126th\n- arwu: 151 - 200th\n- qs: 113th\n\nThen, checking for University of T\u00fcbingen, which is in Row 5:\n- wur: 201 - 225th\n- arwu: 151 - 200th\n- qs: 144th\n\nNow, the claim says Dartmouth ranks higher than T\u00fcbingen. To assess this, I need to see if Dartmouth's rank is indeed better (lower number) in all or at least one of the ranking systems.\n\nLooking at wur rankings:\nDartmouth is 126th vs T\u00fcbingen which is 201-225th. Here, Dartmouth is higher because a lower number means a better rank.\n\nIn arwu, both are within the same range: Dartmouth 151-200 and T\u00fcbingen also 151-200. So they're equal here.\n\nFor qs, Dartmouth is 113th and T\u00fcbingen is 144th. Again, Dartmouth is higher since 113 < 144.\n\nSo in both wur and qs rankings, Dartmouth has a better (lower) rank than T\u00fcbingen. Since the claim doesn't specify which ranking to use, but generally mentions \"rank,\" it's reasonable to consider that Dartmouth does indeed rank higher in at least two of the three systems provided. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells would be the wur and qs rankings for both Dartmouth and T\u00fcbingen, as well as their respective institutions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim about the universities is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"university of western australia do better, overall than durham university despite it's late date of establishment.\"\n\nFirst, I'll identify which rows in the table correspond to these universities. From the table:\n\n- Row 6 is about University of Western Australia (UWA).\n- Row 2 is about Durham University.\n\nNext, I need to compare their world rankings across the different ranking systems provided: WUR, ARWU, and QS for the year 2013.\n\nLooking at UWA's ranks:\n- WUR: 168th\n- ARWU: 91st\n- QS: 134th\n\nDurham University's ranks:\n- WUR: 80th\n- ARWU: 201-300th\n- QS: 90th\n\nNow, let me compare each ranking:\n\n1. **WUR (World University Rankings)**:\n   - UWA is ranked 168th.\n   - Durham is 80th.\n   So, Durham does better here.\n\n2. **ARWU**:\n   - UWA is 91st.\n   - Durham is in the 201-300th range.\n   Here, UWA clearly outperforms Durham.\n\n3. **QS**:\n   - UWA is 134th.\n   - Durham is 90th.\n   Again, Durham is better here.\n\nNow, considering \"overall\" performance, it's not just about one ranking but all three. Let's see:\n\n- In WUR and QS, Durham is higher (better) than UWA.\n- Only in ARWU does UWA rank higher.\n\nSo out of the three rankings, two are better for Durham, and one is better for UWA. Therefore, overall, Durham seems to have a better performance across more ranking systems compared to UWA.\n\nAdditionally, considering the establishment year: Durham was established in 1832, while UWA was established much later in 1911. The claim mentions that despite UWA's later establishment date, it does better overall. But based on the rankings, this doesn't hold true as UWA is not performing better across all or even most of the rankings.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim compares University of Western Australia (UWA) and Durham University across their world ranks in three systems (WUR, ARWU, QS). While UWA outperforms Durham in ARWU, Durham is higher in WUR and QS. Overall, Durham has better rankings in two out of three categories.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Durham University is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"overall, durham university have the best rank, ie 80th, in the world rank by - wur 2013 category.\" So I'm looking for information about Durham University's ranking specifically under the WUR (World University Rankings) from 2013.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\n- Each row represents a different university with various details like members, country, year established, and different world rankings.\n- The columns include 'members', 'country', 'year established', and several world rank categories. The relevant column here is \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\".\n\nI'll focus on the rows to find Durham University.\n\nLooking at Row 2: It says members: durham university, country: uk, year established: 1832, and under the WUR category, it's ranked 80th. The claim mentions exactly this rank of 80th for Durham in the WUR 2013.\n\nNow, I need to verify if 80th is indeed the best (i.e., highest or top) rank among all universities listed. So let me check the other rows:\n\n- Row 1: Dartmouth College - WUR rank 126th\n- Row 3: Queens University - WUR rank 226-250th\n- Row 4: University of Otago - WUR rank 226-250th\n- Row 5: University of T\u00fcbingen - WUR rank 201-225th\n- Row 6: University of Western Australia - WUR rank 168th\n\nComparing all these, Durham's 80th is the highest (best) among them.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"queen university of canada have not do as well as dartmouth college in all 3 category.\" First off, I should make sure I understand the institutions correctly. From the table, I see there's a Queen's University in Canada and Dartmouth College in the USA.\n\nThe table provides world rankings from three different sources: WUR, ARWU, and QS for the year 2013. The claim is that Queen's hasn't done as well as Dartmouth in all three categories. So I need to compare their ranks in each category.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nFor Dartmouth College (Row 1):\n- WUR: 126th\n- ARWU: 151-200th\n- QS: 113th\n\nFor Queen's University (Row 3):\n- WUR: 226-250th\n- ARWU: 201-300th\n- QS: 189th\n\nNow, comparing each category:\n\n1. **WUR**: Dartmouth is 126th, which is better than Queen's (226-250th). So in this category, Dartmouth does better.\n\n2. **ARWU**: Dartmouth is ranked between 151-200, while Queen's is 201-300. So again, Dartmouth is higher here as well.\n\n3. **QS**: Dartmouth is at 113th, whereas Queen's is at 189th. Once more, Dartmouth has a better rank.\n\nSince in all three categories\u2014WUR, ARWU, and QS\u2014Dartmouth College ranks higher than Queen's University of Canada, the claim that Queen's hasn't done as well in all three categories holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Dartmouth College outperforms Queen's University in all three ranking categories.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about University of T\u00fcbingen is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"give how it have have a great headstart , university of t\u00fcbingen , germany have not do as well as the other university , overall.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It seems to suggest that despite having a great headstart (probably due to being established earlier), University of T\u00fcbingen hasn't performed as well as the other universities in terms of their world rankings.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different university with several columns: members, country, year established, and three different world ranks from 2013\u2014WUR, ARWU, and QS. \n\nThe University of T\u00fcbingen is in Row 5. Its establishment year is 1477, which is much earlier than the other universities listed (Dartmouth: 1769, Durham: 1832, Queens: 1841, Otago: 1869, Western Australia: 1911). So, it does have a significant headstart in terms of age.\n\nNow, let's check the world ranks. For WUR (World University Rankings), T\u00fcbingen is ranked 201-225th. Comparatively:\n- Dartmouth is 126th\n- Durham is 80th\n- Queens is 226-250th\n- Otago is 226-250th\n- Western Australia is 168th\n\nSo, T\u00fcbingen's WUR rank is lower (worse) than Dartmouth, Durham, and Western Australia but similar to Queens and Otago.\n\nFor ARWU (Academic Ranking of World Universities), T\u00fcbingen is in the 151-200th range. Other universities:\n- Dartmouth: 151-200th\n- Durham: 201-300th\n- Queens: 201-300th\n- Otago: 201-300th\n- Western Australia: 91st\n\nHere, T\u00fcbingen is better than Durham, Queens, and Otago but worse than Dartmouth and Western Australia.\n\nFor QS (Quacquarelli Symonds) rankings, T\u00fcbingen is at 144th. Others:\n- Dartmouth: 113th\n- Durham: 90th\n- Queens: 189th\n- Otago: 155th\n- Western Australia: 134th\n\nSo, in QS, T\u00fcbingen is better than Queens but worse than Dartmouth, Durham, and Western Australia.\n\nOverall, considering all three rankings, T\u00fcbingen doesn't consistently outperform the other universities. In some cases, it's worse, especially when compared to institutions with a much shorter history (like Durham established in 1832 vs. T\u00fcbingen in 1477). The claim is that despite having a great headstart, T\u00fcbingen hasn't done as well as the others overall.\n\nLooking at the rankings, it seems that some universities established later have better rankings. For example, Durham (1832) has higher QS and WUR ranks than T\u00fcbingen. Similarly, Western Australia (1911) is ranked higher in both ARWU and QS than T\u00fcbingen.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds because even with a much earlier establishment year, University of T\u00fcbingen's world rankings are not better than some other universities listed. This supports that it hasn't performed as well overall despite the headstart.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table, as University of T\u00fcbingen has an earlier establishment date but does not rank higher across all ranking systems compared to others.\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year established\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the  - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu  , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs  , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}",

It's asserting that Dartmouth College has never had a higher ranking compared to the University of T\u00fcbingen across all the given ranking systems and years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different university with various rankings from three sources: WUR, ARWU, and QS in 2013. \n\nI should compare Dartmouth's ranks with those of the University of T\u00fcbingen for each ranking system to see if Dartmouth ever ranked higher.\n\nLet me go through each column:\n\n1. **WUR (World University Rankings)**:\n   - Dartmouth: 126th\n   - T\u00fcbingen: 201-225th\n\nHere, 126 is better (higher rank) than being in the 201-225 range. So Dartmouth ranked higher in WUR.\n\n2. **ARWU**:\n   - Dartmouth: 151-200th\n   - T\u00fcbingen: 151-200th\n\nThey are both in the same range, so no difference here.\n\n3. **QS**:\n   - Dartmouth: 113th\n   - T\u00fcbingen: 144th\n\nAgain, Dartmouth is higher (better rank) than T\u00fcbingen in QS.\n\nSo, across all three rankings, Dartmouth either ranks higher or equal to T\u00fcbingen. In two cases (WUR and QS), Dartmouth has a better rank, which means the claim that Dartmouth has never ranked higher is false because there are instances where they did.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Dartmouth College ranked higher than the University of T\u00fcbingen in both WUR and QS rankings.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"university of western australia do better in all ranking than durham university despite its late date of establishment.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim means. It's saying that University of Western Australia (UWA) performed better in all rankings compared to Durham University, even though UWA was established later.\n\nLet me look at the table and find the rows for these two universities. From Row 6, it's about the University of Western Australia. The columns I need are the ranking ones: wur, arwu, qs. Similarly, for Durham University, which is in Row 2.\n\nLooking at the rankings:\n\nFor UWA:\n- WUR rank: 168th\n- ARWU rank: 91st\n- QS rank: 134th\n\nDurham's ranks:\n- WUR: 80th\n- ARWU: 201-300th\n- QS: 90th\n\nNow, let me compare each ranking. \n\nFirst, the WUR rank. UWA is at 168th and Durham is at 80th. Wait, that means Durham is ranked higher because lower numbers are better in rankings. So for WUR, Durham did better than UWA.\n\nNext, ARWU: UWA is 91st, while Durham is 201-300th. So here, UWA is definitely better since 91 is much higher (better) than 201+. \n\nQS ranking: UWA is 134th and Durham is 90th. Again, Durham has a better rank because 90 is lower than 134.\n\nWait, so in two out of three rankings, Durham did better than UWA. The only ranking where UWA did better is ARWU. So the claim says UWA does better in \"all\" rankings. But that's not true because they don't do better in all; they are worse in WUR and QS.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions that despite UWA being established later, but I think that doesn't affect whether they are better in all rankings, which they aren't. So the overall claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe University of Western Australia does not rank higher than Durham University across all ranking systems as required by the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim about Durham University is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"durham university have the second - best rank , ie , 80th , in the world rank by - wur 2013 category.\"\n\nSo, the claim states that Durham University has the second-best rank (80th) according to WUR 2013. I need to check if this is accurate.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a university with details including its members, country, year established, and world ranks from different sources in 2013.\n\nLet me go through each relevant cell:\n\n- For Durham University, it's Row 2.\n- The column we're interested in is \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\", which has a value of 80th for Durham.\n\nNow, to verify if this is the second-best rank among all universities listed. I'll check each row's WUR rank:\n\n1. Dartmouth College: 126th\n2. Durham University: 80th\n3. Queen's University: 226-250th\n4. University of Otago: 226-250th\n5. University of T\u00fcbingen: 201-225th\n6. University of Western Australia: 168th\n\nLooking at these, the ranks in ascending order (lower numbers are better) would be:\n\nDurham: 80th  \nUniversity of Western Australia: 168th  \nUniversity of T\u00fcbingen: 201-225th  \nDartmouth College: 126th? Wait, no. Dartmouth is 126th which is better than 168th. So the order should be:\n\nDurham (80), Dartmouth (126), University of Western Australia (168), then T\u00fcbingen (201-225), followed by Otago and Queen's.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 126 is better than 168. So the correct order from best to worst (lowest rank number first):\n\nDurham: 80  \nDartmouth: 126  \nUniversity of Western Australia: 168  \nUniversity of T\u00fcbingen: 201-225  \nQueen's University and Otago: both in 226-250.\n\nSo Durham is actually the highest-ranked university (best rank) among those listed, not the second. Therefore, the claim that it has the second-best rank is incorrect.\n\nWait, but I need to double-check. Maybe I misread the ranks. Let me list them again:\n\n1. Durham: 80th\n2. Dartmouth: 126th\n3. Western Australia: 168th\n4. T\u00fcbingen: 201-225th\n5. Otago and Queen's: 226-250th\n\nSo, indeed, Durham is the best rank (80th), followed by Dartmouth at 126th as second. Therefore, Durham doesn't have the second-best but the best.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"second-best.\" So if I'm correct, the claim is false because Durham actually has the highest rank, not the second.\n\nHowever, another thought: perhaps there are more universities in the dataset beyond these six rows that we're considering. But based on the table given, which includes only these six institutions, Durham is the top-ranked.\n\nThus, the claim that Durham has the second-best rank (80th) is FALSE because it's actually the best among those listed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Durham University has the second-best rank of 80th according to WUR 2013. However, examining the table shows that Durham's rank is indeed 80th and is the highest among all listed universities in that category.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "queen university of canada have do better than dartmouth college in all 3 category",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"queen university of canada have do better than dartmouth college in all 3 category\". Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should identify which universities are being compared. The claim mentions Queens University (Canada) and Dartmouth College. Looking at the table:\n\n- Dartmouth College is in Row 1.\n- Queens University is in Row 3.\n\nThe three ranking categories mentioned are WUR, ARWU, and QS for the year 2013.\n\nLet me check each category one by one.\n\nFor WUR (World University Rankings):\n- Dartmouth's rank is 126th (Row 1).\n- Queens' rank is 226-250th (Row 3).\n\nSo, 126th is better than 226-250th. Therefore, Dartmouth did better here.\n\nFor ARWU:\n- Dartmouth's rank is 151-200th (Row 1).\n- Queens' rank is also 201-300th (Row 3).\n\nHere, 151-200th is better than 201-300th. So again, Dartmouth did better.\n\nFor QS:\n- Dartmouth's rank is 113th (Row 1).\n- Queens' rank is 189th (Row 3).\n\nQS-wise, 113th is better than 189th. Dartmouth still leads here.\n\nSince the claim states that Queens have done better in all three categories, but in reality, Dartmouth has a higher rank (better) in each category, the claim must be FALSE. \n\nSo I'll mark it as FALSE and list the relevant cells from both universities across the three ranking columns.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the  - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the  - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. The claim is about the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany and whether they have the worst rank in every single ranking mentioned in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the data for the University of T\u00fcbingen, which is Row 5 in the table. Let's see what their ranks are according to each ranking source.\n\nLooking at the WUR (World University Rankings) for 2013, they're ranked between 201st and 225th. For ARWU (Academic Ranking of World Universities), they are also in the 151-200th range. And according to QS, their rank is 144th.\n\nNow, I need to check if these ranks are indeed the worst across all universities listed. Let's go through each ranking one by one.\n\nStarting with WUR: The lowest rank here (i.e., the worst) would be the highest numerical value. Looking at all the rows:\n\n- Dartmouth: 126th\n- Durham: 80th\n- Queens: 226-250th\n- Otago: 226-250th\n- T\u00fcbingen: 201-225th\n- UWA: 168th\n\nSo, in WUR, the worst rank is actually Queens and Otago at 226-250th. T\u00fcbingen is slightly better than them because 201-225 is lower than 226-250. Therefore, T\u00fcbingen isn't the worst in WUR.\n\nNext, ARWU: The ranks are:\n\n- Dartmouth: 151-200th\n- Durham: 201-300th\n- Queens: 201-300th\n- Otago: 201-300th\n- T\u00fcbingen: 151-200th\n- UWA: 91st\n\nHere, the worst rank is shared by Durham, Queens, and Otago at 201-300th. So again, T\u00fcbingen isn't the worst; there are other universities ranked lower.\n\nLastly, QS:\n\n- Dartmouth: 113th\n- Durham: 90th\n- Queens: 189th\n- Otago: 155th\n- T\u00fcbingen: 144th\n- UWA: 134th\n\nIn QS, the worst rank is Queens at 189th. T\u00fcbingen's 144th is better than that.\n\nSo in all three rankings, the University of T\u00fcbingen isn't the worst. There are other universities with lower (worse) ranks in each category. Therefore, the claim that they have the worst rank in every single ranking is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the university doesn't hold the worst rank in any of the rankings provided.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
