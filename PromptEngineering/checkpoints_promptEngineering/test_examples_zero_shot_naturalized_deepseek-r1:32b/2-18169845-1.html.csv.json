    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"pugsley addams be the only role that have 3 people available to play it in the original s\u00e3o paulo cast.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down what this means. The claim is saying two things:\n\n1. Pugsley Addams has three people listed under the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast.\n2. No other roles have three or more people listed for their original S\u00e3o Paulo casts; thus, Pugsley is unique in having exactly three.\n\nI'll start by looking at each row of the table to see which role corresponds to each entry and check the \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\" column.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Gomez Addams - Original SP cast: Daniel Boaventura. Just one person.\n- Row 2: Morticia Addams - Marisa Orth. One person.\n- Row 3: Uncle Fester - Claudio Galvan. One person.\n- Row 4: Grandma Addams - In\u00e1 de Carvalho. One person.\n- Row 5: Wednesday Addams - Laura Lobo. One person.\n- Row 6: Pugsley Addams - The original SP cast has three names: Nicholas Torres, Gustavo Daneluz, Matheus Lustosa. So that's three people here.\n- Row 7: Lurch - Rog\u00e9rio Guedes. One person.\n- Row 8: Mal Beineke - Wellington Nogueira. One person.\n- Row 9: Alice Beineke - Paula Capovilla. One person.\n- Row 10: Lucas Beineke - Beto Sargentelli. One person.\n\nFrom this, I can see that Pugsley Addams is indeed the only role with three people listed in the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast. All other roles have just one or two entries, but none have three except for Pugsley.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because only Pugsley Addams has exactly three actors listed under the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because Pugsley Addams is the only role with three actors in the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"daniel boaventura be 1 of 6 people who play gomez addams\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that Daniel Boaventura is one out of six individuals who have played the role of Gomez Addams in different productions or casts as listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure provided, each row represents a different character from the Addams Family, and for each character, there are multiple columns indicating different casts (Broadway original, closing Broadway, US tour, nonequity tour, S\u00e3o Paulo, Lima). The relevant row here is Row 1, which pertains to Gomez Addams.\n\nRow 1 lists the following actors in various casts:\n- Original Broadway: Nathan Lane\n- Closing Broadway: Roger Rees\n- Original US Tour: Douglas Sills\n- Original Nonequity Tour: Jesse Sharp\n- Original S\u00e3o Paulo: Daniel Boaventura\n- Original Lima: Diego Bertie\n\nSo, under Gomez Addams, there are six different actors listed across these categories. The claim mentions that Daniel Boaventura is one of these six. From the table, I can see that Daniel Boaventura is indeed listed as part of the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast for Gomez Addams.\n\nTherefore, since the table shows exactly six people playing Gomez Addams and Daniel Boaventura is one of them, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Daniel Boaventura is listed as one of the six actors who played Gomez Addams in different productions.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm given a table with information about the cast of \"The Addams Family\" musical in various productions and casts. The claim is that Bebe Neuwirth played Morticia Addams in the original Broadway cast and Krysta Rodriguez played Wednesday Addams. My task is to verify if this claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. Each row represents a different character from The Addams Family. For each character, there are several columns indicating which actors played them in various casts: original Broadway, closing Broadway, US Tour, Nonequity Tour, S\u00e3o Paulo cast, and Lima cast.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific points:\n1. Bebe Neuwirth was in the original Broadway cast as Morticia Addams.\n2. Krysta Rodriguez was in the original Broadway cast as Wednesday Addams.\n\nI'll need to check each of these against the table.\n\nLooking at Row 2, which is about Morticia Addams:\n- The original Broadway cast is listed as Bebe Neuwirth. That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNow, checking Row 5 for Wednesday Addams:\n- The original Broadway cast here is Krysta Rodriguez. This also aligns with the second part of the claim.\n\nBoth pieces of information are directly supported by the table. There doesn't seem to be any conflicting data or discrepancies in these rows. Therefore, both parts of the claim are accurate based on the provided information.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately reflects the original Broadway casts for both Morticia and Wednesday Addams as per the table.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Rows for Each Character:**\n   - For \"Morticia Addams,\" check Row 2.\n   - For \"Wednesday Addams,\" check Row 5.\n\n2. **Check Original Broadway Casts:**\n   - Row 2, Column \"original broadway cast\" is Bebe Neuwirth. This confirms the first part of the claim.\n   - Row 5, Column \"original broadway cast\" is Krysta Rodriguez. This confirms the second part of the claim.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   Both parts of the claim are supported by the table, so the answer is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_4\", \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nWait, I notice a mistake in the JSON formatting. The row indices should be integers, and the way rows are indexed starts at 0. Morticia is Row 2 (index 1) and Wednesday is Row 5 (index 4). So correcting that:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim states: \"adam riegler and zachary james play their same role in both the original broadway cast and the closing broadway cast.\"\n\nFirst, I should look at each part of this claim step by step. Let's break it down.\n\nThe claim mentions two actors: Adam Riegler and Zachary James. For each, we need to check if they played the same role in both the original Broadway cast and the closing Broadway cast.\n\nStarting with Adam Riegler:\n\nLooking through the table rows, I see that Row 6 is about Pugsley Addams. In this row, under 'original broadway cast', it's Adam Riegler. Under 'closing broadway cast', it's also Adam Riegler. So for Adam Riegler, he plays the same role (Pugsley Addams) in both casts.\n\nNext, Zachary James:\n\nLooking through the rows, Row 7 is about Lurch. Here, under 'original broadway cast' and 'closing broadway cast', it's Zachary James both times. So Zachary James also plays the same role (Lurch) in both original and closing Broadway casts.\n\nSince both Adam Riegler and Zachary James are listed as playing their respective roles in both the original and closing casts, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because both Adam Riegler and Zachary James are listed as playing their same roles in both the original and closing Broadway casts according to the table.\n\n**Answer:**  \n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_6\", \"closing broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"}\n   ]\n}  \nWait, I need to correct the row indices. In the table provided, each role is a separate row starting from Row 1 (Gomez Addams) as index 0? Or are they numbered starting at 1?\n\nLooking back, the user lists rows 1 through 10. So in zero-based indexing for JSON, it would be:\n\nRow 6: Pugsley Addams \u2013 original and closing Broadway cast.\nRow 7: Lurch \u2013 original and closing Broadway cast.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- For Adam Riegler (Pugsley Addams): Row index 5 (since rows start at 1 as row 1, so row 6 is index 5)\nWait no, in JSON, if it's zero-based, then row numbers are 0 to 9. So Row 1: index 0; Row 2: index 1; etc.\n\nSo Pugsley Addams is Row 6, which would be index 5 (since first row is 0). But let me recount:\n\nRow 1: Gomez \u2013 index 0\nRow 2: Morticia \u2013 index 1\nRow 3: Uncle Fester \u2013 index 2\nRow 4: Grandma Addams \u2013 index 3\nRow 5: Wednesday \u2013 index 4\nRow 6: Pugsley \u2013 index 5\nRow 7: Lurch \u2013 index 6\n\nSo for Adam Riegler (Pugsley), relevant cells are at row_index 5, columns 'original broadway cast' and 'closing broadway cast'.\n\nFor Zachary James (Lurch), it's row_index 6, same two columns.\n\nThus, the correct JSON is:\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_ index\":5, \"column_name\":\"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\":\"closing broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"closing broadway cast\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nBut in the initial table provided, row indexes are 1-10. Wait, I think I might have miscounted.\n\nWait no, in the user's message, the table is presented as rows 1 to 10, each with a role and various casts. So when converting to zero-based indexing for JSON, we subtract one from the row number.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 6: Pugsley Addams \u2013 index 5\nRow 7: Lurch \u2013 index 6\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are as above.\n\nBut in my initial answer example, I think it's better to present them correctly with their indices.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_ index\":5, \"column_name\":\"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\":\"closing broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"closing broadway cast\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nBut since the initial rows are 1-10 and in JSON we use zero-based, it's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_ index\":5, \"column_name\":\"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\":\"closing broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"closing broadway cast\"}\n   ]\n}",

The claim states: \"the original lima cast have 11 people available to play 10 role unlike the original broadway cast which only have 10 people available to play 10 role.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. Original Lima Cast: 11 people for 10 roles.\n2. Original Broadway Cast: 10 people for 10 roles.\n\nI'll check each part against the table.\n\nStarting with the original Lima cast. Looking at each role in the \"original lima cast\" column:\n\n- Gomez Addams: Giuseppino Castellano, Brando Gallesi \u2192 2 people\nWait, but looking back at Row 6 for Pugsley Addams, the Lima cast has two names: Giuseppino Castellano and Brando Gallesi. So each role's Lima cast may have one or more actors.\n\nNow, I need to count how many unique individuals are listed across all roles in the original Lima cast.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Lima cast: Diego Bertie \u2192 1\nRow 2: Fiorella Rodriguez \u2192 1\nRow 3: Nicol\u00e1s Fantinato \u2192 1\nRow 4: Patricia Portocarrero \u2192 1\nRow 5: Gina Yangali \u2192 1\nRow 6: Giuseppino Castellano, Brando Gallesi \u2192 2\nRow 7: Gustavo Mayer \u2192 1\nRow 8: Miguel Alvarez \u2192 1\nRow 9: Trilce Cavero \u2192 1\nRow 10: Luis Baca \u2192 1\n\nAdding these up: 1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+1+1 = 12 people. Wait, that's more than the claim says.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\nRow 1: 1\nRow 2: 1 \u2192 total 2\nRow 3: 1 \u2192 3\nRow 4: 1 \u21924\nRow5:1\u21925\nRow6:2\u21927\nRow7:1\u21928\nRow8:1\u21929\nRow9:1\u219210\nRow10:1\u219211\n\nAh, so total of 11 people in the original Lima cast across all roles.\n\nNow for the Original Broadway Cast. Each role's \"original broadway cast\" column has one person except maybe where there are multiple? Let me check each row:\n\nRow 1: Nathan Lane \u21921\nRow2: Bebe Neuwirth\u21921\nRow3: Kevin Chamberlin\u21921\nRow4: Jackie Hoffman\u21921\nRow5: Krysta Rodriguez\u21921\nRow6: Adam Riegler\u21921\nRow7: Zachary James\u21921\nRow8: Terrence Mann\u21921\nRow9: Carolee Carmello\u21921\nRow10: Wesley Taylor\u21921\n\nTotal of 10 people in the original Broadway cast.\n\nSo the claim says Lima has 11 for 10 roles, which matches.

Let me start by understanding what the table shows.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a role in the Addams Family, and under each role, there are different casts for various productions: original Broadway, closing Broadway, US tour, nonequity tour, S\u00e3o Paulo, Lima, etc. \n\nThe claim is about Gomez Addams being played by 8 different actors. I'll check the relevant row for Gomez. That's Row 1. Let me list out all the actors mentioned there:\n\n- Original Broadway cast: Nathan Lane\n- Closing Broadway cast: Roger Rees\n- Original US tour cast: Douglas Sills\n- Original nonequity tour cast: Jesse Sharp\n- Original S\u00e3o Paulo cast: Daniel Boaventura\n- Original Lima cast: Diego Bertie\n\nSo, counting these, there are 6 actors listed for Gomez Addams. The claim says 8 different actors, but according to the table, it's only 6.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some? Let me double-check each column in Row 1:\n\n1. Role: Gomez Addams\n2. Original Broadway cast: Nathan Lane\n3. Closing Broadway cast: Roger Rees\n4. Original US tour cast: Douglas Sills\n5. Original nonequity tour cast: Jesse Sharp\n6. Original S\u00e3o Paulo cast: Daniel Boaventura\n7. Original Lima cast: Diego Bertie\n\nNo, that's all six entries for Gomez. So the claim of 8 actors is incorrect because only 6 are listed.\n\nI think I might have misread something? Let me check if any other roles list additional Gomez actors, but looking through Rows 2 to 10, no, each row corresponds to a different role. Therefore, Row 1 is the only one with Gomez Addams details.\n\nSo the relevant cells are all entries under Row 1, specifically the original Broadway cast, closing Broadway cast, original US tour cast, nonequity tour, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Lima casts.\n\nSince there are six actors listed for Gomez, not eight, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Gomez Addams was played by 8 different actors.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 1 season lurch have 3 people available to play\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll try to parse the claim correctly. It seems a bit ungrammatical, but I think it's saying that for one season, the role of Lurch had three different people who could play it. So, the key points are:\n\n1. Role: Lurch\n2. Number of seasons considered: 1 (maybe implying the first season or just any single season)\n3. Number of people available to play Lurch in that season: 3\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row corresponds to a role, and within each role, there are different casts listed under various categories like original Broadway cast, closing Broadway cast, US tour cast, etc.\n\nFocusing on Row 7, which is for the role of \"Lurch\":\n\n- Original Broadway Cast: Zachary James\n- Closing Broadway Cast: Zachary James\n- Original US Tour Cast: Tom Corbeil\n- Original Nonequity Tour Cast: Dan Olson\n- Original S\u00e3o Paulo Cast: Rog\u00e9rio Guedes\n- Original Lima Cast: Gustavo Mayer\n\nNow, I need to check how many distinct actors are listed for Lurch. Let's list them out:\n\n1. Zachary James (appears twice: original and closing Broadway)\n2. Tom Corbeil (US Tour)\n3. Dan Olson (Nonequity Tour)\n4. Rog\u00e9rio Guedes (S\u00e3o Paulo)\n5. Gustavo Mayer (Lima)\n\nWait, that's five different actors. But the claim says there were three people available to play Lurch in one season.\n\nI think I need to consider whether these actors are from different productions or tours within a single season or across seasons. The table doesn't specify seasons but rather different casts for different productions (Broadway, US Tour, etc.) and locations (S\u00e3o Paulo, Lima). So each of these might be different productions, possibly in different years or seasons.\n\nBut the claim mentions \"1 season,\" so perhaps it's referring to a single production season. Let me check if any of the Lurch entries have three actors listed for a specific category that could represent one season.\n\nLooking again at Row 7:\n\n- Original Broadway: Zachary James\n- Closing Broadway: Zachary James (same person)\n- US Tour: Tom Corbeil\n- Nonequity Tour: Dan Olson\n- S\u00e3o Paulo: Rog\u00e9rio Guedes\n- Lima: Gustavo Mayer\n\nIt seems that each category has one actor, except for the original and closing Broadway casts, which are both Zachary James. So across all categories, there are five distinct actors. However, within a single season (e.g., the original Broadway run), only Zachary James played Lurch.\n\nAlternatively, if considering multiple productions as part of the same season, but that's not clear from the table. The table seems to list different casts for different productions or tours, which might span multiple seasons or be entirely separate.\n\nGiven this, I don't see any single category (like original Broadway) having three actors. Each category has one actor except where a role is played by the same person in both original and closing casts.\n\nTherefore, the claim that there was 1 season where Lurch had three people available to play doesn't seem to be supported by the table. The table lists multiple actors across different productions but not three within a single season or category.\n</think>\n\nThe claim suggests that in one season, three actors were available for Lurch's role. However, examining the table shows each cast category has only one actor, except where the same person is listed twice. There's no instance of three actors listed under a single production category.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"original us tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"original nonequity tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"original lima cast\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Scanning through the roles, I see that Row 2 is for \"morticia addams,\" and under \"original broadway cast\" it's Bebe Neuwirth. So, she played Morticia Addams in the original Broadway cast.\n\nNow, to check if she was part of the original Lima cast. In the same row (Row 2), I look at the \"original lima cast\" column. The names listed there are Fiorella Rodriguez and another name that's partially visible as fiorella rodriguez\u2014wait, no, actually, looking again, it's only Fiorella Rodr\u00edguez. So Bebe Neuwirth isn't listed here.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Bebe Neuwirth was in the original Broadway cast but not in the original Lima cast.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original lima cast\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"there be not actor who play the same role in the opening and closing cast\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim is saying. It seems a bit ungrammatical but I think it means that there isn't any actor who played the same role both in the original (opening) and closing casts of the Broadway show. So, we're checking if for each role, the actors in the 'original broadway cast' and 'closing broadway cast' columns are different.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to check these two columns. Each row represents a role with multiple casts listed under different categories like original Broadway, closing Broadway, US tour, etc.\n\nStarting with Row 1: Gomez Addams.\n- Original Broadway Cast: Nathan Lane\n- Closing Broadway Cast: Roger Rees\nThese are two different actors. So, no overlap here.\n\nRow 2: Morticia Addams.\n- Original: Bebe Neuwirth\n- Closing: Brooke Shields\nDifferent actors again. No issue.\n\nRow 3: Uncle Fester.\n- Original: Kevin Chamberlin\n- Closing: Brad Oscar\nAgain, different people.\n\nRow 4: Grandma Addams.\n- Original: Jackie Hoffman\n- Closing: Jackie Hoffman\nWait a minute, same actor here! So for this role, the original and closing Broadway casts are the same person. This directly contradicts the claim that no actor plays the same role in both opening and closing.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I'll check the remaining roles too.\n\nRow 5: Wednesday Addams.\n- Original: Krysta Rodriguez\n- Closing: Rachel Potter\nDifferent actors.\n\nRow 6: Pugsley Addams.\n- Original: Adam Riegler\n- Closing: Adam Riegler\nSame actor here as well. So another instance where the original and closing casts are the same person.\n\nRows 7 to 10:\n- Lurch: Zachary James in both.\n- Mal Beineke: Terrence Mann (original) and Adam Grupper (closing). Different.\n- Alice Beineke: Carolee Carmello (original) and Heidi Blickenstaff (closing). Different.\n- Lucas Beineke: Wesley Taylor (original) and Jesse Swenson (closing). Different.\n\nSo from the table, I found at least two roles where the same actor was in both the original and closing casts: Grandma Addams (Jackie Hoffman) and Pugsley Addams (Adam Riegler). This means the claim is false because there are actors who played the same role in both casts.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE. The relevant cells show that Jackie Hoffman and Adam Riegler were in both the original and closing Broadway casts for their respective roles.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "there be always extra actor available for each role",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be always extra actor available for each role\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what this claim means.\n\nThe phrase \"always extra actor available\" suggests that for every role listed in the table, there's at least one backup or additional actor beyond the primary ones mentioned. So I need to check if each role has more than just the original and closing Broadway casts, perhaps looking into other tours or international casts as potential extras.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a role with various cast members under different categories: original Broadway, closing Broadway, original US tour, original nonequity tour, original S\u00e3o Paulo, and original Lima casts. The claim is about whether there are always extra actors available for each role, which I interpret as having more than just one actor listed per role.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Gomez Addams (Row 1)**: Original Broadway - Nathan Lane; Closing Broadway - Roger Rees; US Tour - Douglas Sills; Nonequity Tour - Jesse Sharp; S\u00e3o Paulo - Daniel Boaventura; Lima - Diego Bertie.\n   - Multiple actors listed, so more than one available.\n\n2. **Morticia Addams (Row 2)**: Original Broadway - Bebe Neuwirth; Closing Broadway - Brooke Shields; US Tour - Sara Gettelfinger; Nonequity Tour - Keleen Snowgren; S\u00e3o Paulo - Marisa Orth; Lima - Fiorella Rodr\u00edguez.\n   - Again, multiple actors, so extra available.\n\n3. **Uncle Fester (Row 3)**: Original Broadway - Kevin Chamberlin; Closing Broadway - Brad Oscar; US Tour - Blake Hammond; Nonequity Tour - Shaun Rice; S\u00e3o Paulo - Claudio Galv\u00e1n; Lima - Nicol\u00e1s Fantinato.\n   - Multiple actors, so extra available.\n\n4. **Grandma Addams (Row 4)**: Original Broadway - Jackie Hoffman (same as closing); US Tour - Pippa Pearthree; Nonequity Tour - Amanda Bruton; S\u00e3o Paulo - In\u00e1 de Carvalho; Lima - Patricia Portocarrero.\n   - While the original and closing are the same, there are other actors listed for different tours. So extra available.\n\n5. **Wednesday Addams (Row 5)**: Original Broadway - Krysta Rodr\u00edguez; Closing Broadway - Rachel Potter; US Tour - Cortney Wolfson; Nonequity Tour - Jennifer Fogarty; S\u00e3o Paulo - Laura Lobo; Lima - Gina Yangali.\n   - Multiple actors, extra available.\n\n6. **Pugsley Addams (Row 6)**: Original Broadway - Adam Riegler (same as closing); US Tour - Patrick D Kennedy; Nonequity Tour - Sam Primack; S\u00e3o Paulo - Nicholas Torres, Gustavo Daneluz, Matheus Lustosa; Lima - Giuseppino Castellano, Brando Gallesi.\n   - Not only multiple actors but even more in the S\u00e3o Paulo and Lima casts. So definitely extra available.\n\n7. **Lurch (Row 7)**: Original Broadway - Zachary James (same as closing); US Tour - Tom Corbeil; Nonequity Tour - Dan Olson; S\u00e3o Paulo - Rog\u00e9rio Guedes; Lima - Gustavo Mayer.\n   - Multiple actors, so extra available.\n\n8. **Mal Beineke (Row 8)**: Original Broadway - Terrence Mann; Closing Broadway - Adam Grupper; US Tour - Martin Vidnovic; Nonequity Tour - Mark Poppleton; S\u00e3o Paulo - Wellington Nogueira; Lima - Miguel Alvarez.\n   - Multiple actors, extra available.\n\n9. **Alice Beineke (Row 9)**: Original Broadway - Carolee Carmello; Closing Broadway - Heidi Blickenstaff; US Tour - Crista Moore; Nonequity Tour - Blair Anderson; S\u00e3o Paulo - Paula Capovilla; Lima - Trilce Cavero.\n   - Multiple actors, extra available.\n\n10. **Lucas Beineke (Row 10)**: Original Broadway - Wesley Taylor; Closing Broadway - Jesse Swenson; US Tour - Brian Justin Crum; Nonequity Tour - Bryan Welnicki; S\u00e3o Paulo - Beto Sargentelli; Lima - Luis Baca.\n    - Multiple actors, extra available.\n\nWait a minute. Let me double-check each role to ensure that every single one has more than just the original and closing Broadway casts. For instance, Grandma Addams in Row 4: the original and closing are both Jackie Hoffman. So, does this mean there's only one actor? But looking further down, the US Tour is Pippa Pearthree, Nonequity is Amanda Bruton, S\u00e3o Paulo is In\u00e1 de Carvalho, Lima is Patricia Portocarrero. So even though the original and closing are same person, other casts have different actors. Therefore, there are extra actors available beyond the Broadway ones.\n\nBut what about if a role only had one actor listed? For example, if a row only had the original and closing as the same person with no others, then it would mean only one actor is available, which would make the claim FALSE for that role. But in this case, every role has multiple actors across different productions.\n\nWait another thought: The term \"always extra\" might imply that there's at least two actors per role. Since each row has more than one cast member across various categories, it seems like all roles have more than one actor available. Therefore, the claim holds true for all roles in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as every role in the table lists multiple actors beyond just the original and closing Broadway casts, indicating that there are always extra actors available.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": \"TRUE\"\n}\n```",
