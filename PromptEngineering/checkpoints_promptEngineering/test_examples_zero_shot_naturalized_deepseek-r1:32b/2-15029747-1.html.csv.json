The claim states: \"brandi love be nominate for 2 award at the avn award ceremony in 2013\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse this claim correctly. It seems like there's a typo in the name\u2014it should probably be \"Brandi Love\" instead of \"be nominate,\" which might mean \"was nominated.\" So, the corrected claim is: Brandi Love was nominated for two awards at the AVN Award ceremony in 2013.\n\nNext, I'll look through each row of the table to see if it pertains to the AVN Awards in 2013. \n\nLooking at Row 1: The year is 2013, ceremony is AVN award, result is nominated. The award category is MILF/Cougar Performer of the Year. Work is N/A. So this is one nomination for Brandi Love.\n\nRow 2: Also in 2013, AVN Award, result is nominated. The award here is Most Outrageous Sex Scene (with Kelly Madison), and the work is \"big titty milfs.\" This seems like a second nomination for Brandi Love at the same ceremony.\n\nRows 3 and 4 are from Nightmoves Awards, so they don't apply to this claim. Row 5 is from xbiz Award, which also isn't relevant here.\n\nSo, based on Rows 1 and 2, Brandi Love was nominated twice at the AVN Awards in 2013. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"award\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine if the claim \"brandi love be only nominated for best as 1 time in 2013\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The key points here are:\n- The person involved: Brandi Love\n- The award category: Best Ass\n- The year: 2013\n- The status: Only nominated once\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, it has multiple rows with different ceremonies and awards. I'll go through each row to check if there's any mention of \"Best Ass\" or related categories.\n\nRow 1 talks about the AVN Award for Milf/Cougar Performer of the Year. Not relevant here.\nRow 2 is also an AVN Award, but for Most Outrageous Sex Scene with Kelly Madison. Still not the category we're looking for.\nRow 3 mentions the Nightmoves Award for Best Cougar/Milf Performer (Editor\u2019s Choice). Again, not related to Best Ass.\nRow 4 has the Nightmoves Award for Best Ass, and the result is \"nominated\". This seems relevant because it matches the award category in the claim. The work is listed as N/A, but since Brandi Love isn't mentioned explicitly, I need to infer if she's involved here.\nRow 5 is about the XBIZ Award for Web Star of the Year, which doesn't fit either.\n\nWait a minute, none of the rows mention \"Brandi Love\" by name. All entries are in a naturalized format without specifying individual names. So, how do I know that Brandi Love was nominated? The table doesn't list her explicitly; it just shows awards and results.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions Brandi Love being nominated once for Best Ass in 2013. However, the table only shows one nomination under the award \"Best Ass\" at Nightmoves Awards with result \"nominated\". But since Brandi Love isn't named in any row, I can't confirm that she was the one nominated.\n\nTherefore, without explicit mention of her name, the claim can't be fully supported. It might be true if we assume she's the one nominated under Row 4, but given the data, it's safer to say it's FALSE because there's no direct evidence linking Brandi Love to that nomination.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not explicitly mention \"Brandi Love\" in any of its rows. However, it shows a nomination for \"Best Ass\" at the Nightmoves Awards in 2013 (Row 4). Since the claim specifies Brandi Love being nominated once, but her name isn't listed, we can't confirm the claim as TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"award\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"brandi love be nominate for a total of 5 award in 2013\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the table provided. It has five rows, each representing different awards and results from 2013. Each row includes details like year, ceremony, result, award, and work.\n\nThe claim states that Brandi Love was nominated for a total of five awards in 2013. So I need to check how many times she was nominated across these entries.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 1: Year is 2013, Ceremony is AVN Award, Result is 'nominated', Award is MILF/Cougar Performer of the Year.\n- Row 2: Year is 2013, Ceremony is AVN Award, Result is 'nominated', Award is Most Outrageous Sex Scene (with Kelly Madison).\n- Row 3: Year is 2013, Ceremony is Nightmoves Award, Result is 'won', so this isn't a nomination.\n- Row 4: Year is 2013, Ceremony is Nightmoves Award, Result is 'nominated', Award is Best Ass.\n- Row 5: Year is 2013, Ceremony is XBIZ Award, Result is 'nominated', Award is Web Star of the Year.\n\nNow, I need to count how many times Brandi Love was nominated. Each row with a result of 'nominated' counts as one nomination. Let's go through each:\n\nRow 1: Nominated \u2192 +1\nRow 2: Nominated \u2192 +1\nRow 3: Won \u2192 Doesn't count towards nominations.\nRow 4: Nominated \u2192 +1\nRow 5: Nominated \u2192 +1\n\nAdding those up, that's four nominations. The claim says five, so that would make the claim FALSE.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if each of these awards is for Brandi Love or someone else. The table doesn't specify individual names except in Row 2 where it mentions 'with Kelly Madison', which might imply a shared nomination. So, perhaps only four nominations are applicable to Brandi Love.\n\nTherefore, since the claim states five nominations but we have four from the table, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Brandi Love was nominated for five awards in 2013. The table shows four nominations and one win, so the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"big titty milfs be the only name work brandi love receive an award nomination for in 2013.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this a bit. It seems like it's saying that Brandi Love was nominated for awards in 2013, and her only work that got nominated is \"Big Titty Milfs.\" So the claim is asserting that she didn't have any other nominations besides this one.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are five rows, all from 2013. I need to check each row to see if Brandi Love has more than one nomination or not. \n\nRow 1: Ceremony is AVN Award, result is nominated for MILF/Cougar Performer of the Year, work is N/A.\nRow 2: AVN Award again, nominated for Most Outrageous Sex Scene (with Kelly Madison), work is Big Titty Milfs.\nRow 3: Nightmoves Award, won Best Cougar/MILF Performer (Editor\u2019s Choice), work N/A.\nRow 4: Nightmoves Award, nominated for Best Ass, work N/A.\nRow 5: XBIZ Award, nominated for Web Star of the Year, work N/A.\n\nWait a minute, the table doesn't mention \"Brandi Love\" anywhere. It just lists awards and works without specifying who received them. So does that mean all these are about Brandi Love? Or is she one person among others?\n\nThe claim mentions \"brandi love receive an award nomination,\" so I assume all these rows pertain to her. If that's the case, let's check how many nominations she had in 2013.\n\nRow 1: Nominated for MILF/Cougar Performer of the Year. Work is N/A.\nRow 2: Nominated for Most Outrageous Sex Scene with Kelly Madison. Work is Big Titty Milfs.\nRow 3: Won Best Cougar/MILF Performer, work N/A.\nRow 4: Nominated for Best Ass, work N/A.\nRow 5: Nominated for Web Star of the Year, work N/A.\n\nSo looking at this, she was nominated multiple times in 2013. The claim says that \"Big Titty Milfs\" is the only work she received a nomination for. But according to the table, there are several other nominations where the work isn't specified (like Row 1, 3, 4, and 5) or another specific work in Row 2.\n\nWait, actually, looking again: In Row 2, the work is \"big titty milfs.\" So that's one nomination. But Rows 1, 3, 4, and 5 have different award categories but their work is listed as N/A. Does that mean these are separate nominations for Brandi Love without a specific associated work? \n\nIf so, then she has multiple nominations beyond just \"big titty milfs.\" So the claim says it's the only one, which would be false because there are others.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The table might not list all of her works for each nomination\u2014some have N/A for work. But each row is a separate award and result. So even if some don't specify the work, she was nominated in multiple categories, implying multiple nominations. \n\nTherefore, the claim that \"Big Titty Milfs\" is the only work she received a nomination for is incorrect because there are other awards where her work isn't listed but still count as nominations.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells would include all the rows where she was nominated in 2013. Looking at the table:\n\nRow 2 has \"big titty milfs\" as the work for a nomination.\nRows 1,3,4,5 also have nominations but without specifying the same work.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because she had more than one nomination beyond that specific work.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"Big Titty Milfs\" was the only work Brandi Love received an award nomination for in 2013. However, the table shows multiple nominations across different awards and categories, including some without a specified work but still indicating separate nominations.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"award\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine whether the claim \"Brandi Love do not win web star of the year at any award ceremony in 2013\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll examine each row in the table to see if it pertains to Brandi Love and specifically mentions her winning the \"web star of the year\" award in 2013.\n\nLooking at Row 1: It's about the AVN Award in 2013.

This is about Brandi Love, as the work is N/A, but this isn't the web star award either.\n\nRow 4: Another nomination at the Nightmoves Awards for Best Ass. Still not related to the claim.\n\nRow 5: Xbiz Award in 2013 with a nomination for Web Star of the Year. The result is nominated, which means she didn't win. But wait, does this row mention Brandi Love? It just says \"work: n/a,\" so it's unclear if this award entry refers to her.\n\nNow, the claim states that Brandi Love did not win the web star award in 2013.

It states that Brandi Love won two awards at the AVN Awards in 2013. To verify this, I'll look through each row of the table to see if there are any entries for the AVN Award in 2013 where she was a winner.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: Year 2013, AVN Award, result is \"nominated\", award category is Milf/Cougar Performer of the Year. So, this isn't a win.\n- Row 2: Again, year 2013, AVN Award, result is \"nominated\", award category is Most Outrageous Sex Scene (with Kelly Madison). Another nomination, not a win.\n- Rows 3 and 4 are Nightmoves Awards. These aren't relevant to the claim about AVN Awards.\n- Row 5 is an Xbiz Award, which also isn't related.\n\nFrom this, I can see that Brandi Love had two nominations at the AVN Awards in 2013 but didn't win any awards there. The claim mentions her winning two awards, which doesn't align with the data provided. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells: Rows 1 and 2 both pertain to AVN Awards in 2013 where Brandi Love was nominated.

Maybe it should be \"nominated twice for Best Ass at two different award ceremonies in 2013.\" So the key points are: Brandi Love was nominated twice for an award related to Best Ass in two different ceremonies in 2013.\n\nNow, looking at the table rows:\n\nRow 1: AVN Award nomination for MILF/Cougar performer.\nRow 2: AVN Award nomination for Most Outrageous Sex Scene with Kelly Madison.\nRow 3: Nightmoves Award win for Best Cougar MILF (Editor\u2019s Choice).\nRow 4: Nightmoves Award nomination for Best Ass.\nRow 5: XBIZ Award nomination for Web Star of the Year.\n\nLooking at the nominations, only Row 4 mentions \"Best Ass\" and it's a nomination from the Nightmoves Award. There's no other row that has an award specifically for Best Ass or anything similar in another ceremony like AVN or XBIZ.\n\nSo, according to the table, Brandi Love was nominated once for Best Ass at the Nightmoves Awards.

The claim says: \"big titty milfs be the third name work that brandi love receive an award for in 2013.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions a specific work title, \"big titty milfs,\" and it refers to this being the third award that Brandi Love received in 2013. So I need to check two things: whether \"big titty militants\" is indeed an award she received in 2013, and if it was her third such award.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are five rows with data for the year 2013. Each row has details about different ceremonies, results, awards, and works. Let's go through each relevant cell step by step.\n\nRow 1: The award is \"milf / cougar performer of the year,\" result is nominated. So this doesn't count as a win.\n\nRow 2: Award is \"most outrageous sex scene (with kelly madison),\" work is \"big titty milfs.\" Result is nominated, so no award won here either.\n\nRow 3: Ceremony is nightmoves award, result is won for \"best cougar / milf performer.\" The work is n/a. So this counts as an award win.\n\nRow 4: Award is \"best ass,\" result is nominated. Doesn't count towards the awards won.\n\nRow 5: Award is \"web star of the year,\" result is nominated. Again, not a win.\n\nWait, in the table provided, Brandi Love only has one win in row 3. So she didn't receive three awards in 2013; she only won once and was nominated several times. Therefore, the claim that \"big titty militants\" is her third award can't be true because she didn't even get that work awarded, it's just a nomination.\n\nAdditionally, \"big titty militants\" is listed under row 2 with result as nominated, not won. So there's no award for that title either.\n\nSo putting this together: The claim mentions three awards, but in the table, only one was won, and \"big titty militants\" wasn't an awarded work\u2014it was just nominated.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"brandi love be the winner of the web star of the year award at the xbiz award ceremony in 2013.\" The key points here are:\n\n1. The person involved is Brandi Love.\n2. She supposedly won the \"web star of the year\" award.\n3. This award was given at the Xbiz Award ceremony.\n4. The year in question is 2013.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, there are five rows. Each row has details about different awards and ceremonies from 2013. Let me go through each relevant column to see if any of them mention Brandi Love or the specific award she's claimed to have won.\n\nThe columns in the table are: year, ceremony, result, award, work. \n\nStarting with the year, all entries are for 2013, so that part checks out. Next, looking at the ceremonies: there's Avn Award, Nightmoves Award, and Xbiz Award. The claim mentions the Xbiz Award, so I'll focus on rows where the ceremony is Xbiz.\n\nLooking at row 5: year is 2013, ceremony is Xbiz Award, result is nominated, award is web star of the year, work is N/A. \n\nSo according to this row, Brandi Love was nominated for \"web star of the year\" at the Xbiz Awards in 2013, but she didn't win it because her result is listed as \"nominated,\" not \"won.\" The claim says she \"be the winner,\" which contradicts the table's information.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows mentioning Brandi Love or that award. Scanning through all five rows:\n\n- Rows 1 and 2: Avn Award ceremonies, but neither mention web star of the year nor indicate a win.\n- Row 3: Nightmoves Award where she won for best cougar MILF performer, which is different from web star of the year.\n- Row 4: Another Nightmoves nomination for best ass, not relevant here.\n\nSo only row 5 pertains to the Xbiz Award and the specific award in question. Since it shows she was nominated but didn't win, the claim that she won is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE,\" and the relevant cell is row 5's result column.\n</think>\n\nThe table indicates Brandi Love was nominated for the web star of the year at Xbiz Awards in 2013, not a winner. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
