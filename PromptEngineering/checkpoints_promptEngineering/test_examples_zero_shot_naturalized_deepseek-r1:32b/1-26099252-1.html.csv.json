The claim is: \"the 4.2.1 jelly bean , release november 27th , 2012 , be the stable verson of the software.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what's being claimed here. It seems to say that version 4.2.1 Jelly Bean, released on November 27, 2012, is the stable version of the software.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has multiple rows each representing different browsers and their details. The columns include \"browser,\" \"operating system,\" \"latest stable release,\" and various codec versions like theora, h264, vp8 (webm), vp9 (webm).\n\nI need to find which row contains information about version 4.2.1 Jelly Bean released on November 27, 2012. Scanning through each row:\n\nRow 1: Browser is Android browser, operating system is Android, and the latest stable release is \"4.2.1 jelly bean (November 27 , 2012 )\". That matches exactly what the claim mentions.\n\nNow, checking if this is the correct information. The version number, Jelly Bean, and release date all align with the claim. So, this row supports the claim as TRUE.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information elsewhere in the table that would contradict this. Other rows refer to different browsers or different operating systems, so they aren't relevant here.\n\nTherefore, based on Row 1's data, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"browser\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"latest stable release\"}]}",

The claim states: \"the android browser for android have a theora version of 2.3 and an h264 version of 3.0\".\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim step by step. \n\nThe subject here is \"android browser\" with operating system \"android\". So I need to find the row where both 'browser' is android browser and 'operating system' is android.\n\nLooking at the table, Row 1 has browser: android browser and OS: android. That's the relevant row for this claim.\n\nNow, checking the Theora version in that row. The value under 'theora' is 2.3. So that matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, I need to check the H264 version. In the same row, under 'h264', it's listed as 3.0. That also matches the second part of the claim.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied according to the table, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI should collect the relevant cells for this conclusion. For Theora, it's Row 1, column 'theora'. For H264, it's also Row 1, column 'h264'.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- row_index: 0 (since rows start at 0)\n- column_name: \"theora\"\nand\n- row_index: 0\n- column_name: \"h264\"\n\nThat's all.

Each row represents a different browser with various attributes like operating system, latest stable release, and support for different video codecs: Theora, H264, VP8 (WebM), and VP9 (WebM).\n\nThe claim mentions Google Chrome specifically, so I should focus on the rows where the browser is \"google chrome.\" Looking at the table, row 3 has the browser as google chrome. Let me check that row's details.\n\nIn row 3, under the \"vp8 (webm)\" column, it shows version 6.0, and under \"vp9 (webm)\", it shows 29.0. The claim states that Google Chrome supports both VP8 at 6.0 and VP9 at 29.0, which exactly matches what's in the table.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows for Google Chrome, but looking through the table, row 3 is the only one with \"google chrome\" as the browser. So all relevant data points confirm that both versions are supported.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Google Chrome's row in the table shows support for VP8 (WebM) at version 6.0 and VP9 (WebM) at version 29.0.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"vp8  ( webm )\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"vp9  ( webm )\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"Konqueror supports only vp8 (webm) 4.4, but not vp9 (webm).\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for the row where the browser is Konqueror. Scanning through the rows, I find that Row 7 corresponds to Konqueror.\n\nNext, I need to check two things: does Konqueror support vp8 (WebM) and what version? And does it support vp9 (WebM)?\n\nLooking at the relevant columns in Row 7:\n- For vp8 (webm), the value is listed as 4.4.\n- For vp9 (webm), the value is \"no.\"\n\nThis means that Konqueror supports vp8 with version 4.4 and does not support vp9.\n\nTherefore, the claim accurately reflects what's in the table: Konqueror supports vp8 at version 4.4 but does not support vp9.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Konqueror supports vp8 (WebM) version 4.4 and explicitly states no support for vp9 (WebM).\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_ice\":7, \"column_name\":\"vp8  ( webm )\"},\n     {\"row_ice\":7, \"column_name\":\"vp9  ( webm )\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nHowever, in the correct JSON format with proper keys:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"vp8  ( webm )\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"vp9  ( webm )\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nThe correct row index for Konqueror is 6 since rows are zero-indexed.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"when theora be 2.3 and the h264 be 3.0 , the vp8 ( webm ) be r47759\". So, it's saying that under conditions where Theora is version 2.3 and H264 is version 3.0, VP8 (WebM) should be version r47759.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see if any row has both Theora as 2.3 and H264 as 3.0.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Browser is Android browser. Theora is 2.3 and H264 is 3.0. So this matches the first part of the claim. Now, what's VP8 (WebM) in this row? It says 2.3. But the claim expects r47759 for VP8 when these conditions are met.\n\nNext, I'll check if any other rows have Theora as 2.3 and H264 as 3.0. Let's see:\n\nRow 2: Chromium. Theora is r18297, which doesn't match. So skip.\nRow 3: Google Chrome. Theora is 3.0, so not matching.\nRows 4-6: Internet Explorer on different OSes. Theora in row 4 is manual install, others are no or manual install\u2014so no 2.3 there.\nRow 7: Konqueror. Theora is 4.4, which doesn't match.\nRow 8 and 9: Safari. Theora is no or manual install, so no.\n\nSo only Row 1 has Theora as 2.3 and H264 as 3.0. But in that row, VP8 (WebM) is 2.3, not r47759. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by any row in the table because the expected VP8 value doesn't match when Theora and H264 are at those versions.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies that when Theora is 2.3 and H264 is 3.0, VP8 (WebM) should be r47759.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information in the table provided.\n\nThe claim states: \"when vp8 (webm) be 6.0, and the vp9 (webm) be 29.0, the operating system be window.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components to understand what it's asserting. It seems to say that if a browser has VP8 at version 6.0 and VP9 at 29.0, then the operating system should be Windows.\n\nNext, I'll look through each row of the table to find any instance where VP8 is 6.0 and VP9 is 29.0 simultaneously in the same row. \n\nLooking at Row 3: Browser is Google Chrome. The VP8 (WebM) is listed as 6.0 and VP9 (WebM) is 29.0. So this meets the first two conditions of the claim.\n\nNow, checking the operating system for that row, it's specified as \"windows\". Wait, no\u2014the operating system in Row 3 is actually given as \"30.0.1599.101 (October 15, 2013)\". Hmm, that seems to be the version number of Google Chrome, not the OS. The actual operating system isn't explicitly listed here because it's a browser that runs on multiple platforms.\n\nWait, let me check again. No, looking at the table structure, the columns are: browser, operating system, latest stable release, theora, h264, vp8 (webm), vp9 (webm). So in Row 3, the 'operating system' column is actually \"30.0.1599.101 (October 15, 2013)\", which is incorrect\u2014it should be the OS, but it seems there's a mistake here because that value looks like a browser version.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps Row 3 doesn't correctly specify the operating system. Alternatively, maybe the 'operating system' column in this row is mislabeled or incorrectly entered. If I consider that, then even if VP8 and VP9 meet the claim's criteria, the OS isn't specified as Windows, which could affect the truth of the claim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for other rows where VP8 is 6.0 and VP9 is 29.0. But from a quick scan, it seems only Row 3 has these values. Other browsers like Konqueror have lower versions, Safari doesn't support VP8 or VP9, Internet Explorer in some OSes supports H264 but not the others.\n\nGiven that, since Row 3's operating system is incorrectly specified (as per the data given), it might mean that the browser in question doesn't specifically run on Windows. Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the table structure. Alternatively, maybe the 'operating system' column isn't filled correctly for Google Chrome, making it unclear.\n\nSince the claim states that when VP8 is 6.0 and VP9 is 29.0, the OS should be Windows, but in Row 3, the OS information isn't correct or doesn't specify Windows specifically, I think the claim might not hold true based on this data. Therefore, the answer would be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that when VP8 is 6.0 and VP9 is 29.0, the operating system should be Windows. Checking each row:\n\n- **Row 3**: Google Chrome has VP8 (WebM) as 6.0 and VP9 (WebM) as 29.0. However, the 'operating system' field appears to incorrectly list a version number instead of an OS, making it unclear if it's Windows.\n\nSince there's no correct indication that the OS is Windows when these VP versions are present, the claim isn't supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"vp8 ( webm )\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"vp9 ( webm )\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"operating system\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by carefully reading and understanding both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"the 4.2.1 jelly bean (november 27, 2012) be the stable version where the h264 be 9.0 and vp9 (webm) be no\". \n\nOkay, so breaking this down, there are two main points to check:\n1. The stable version is 4.2.1 Jelly Bean released on November 27, 2012.\n2. In that version, h264 should be 9.0 and vp9 (webm) should be 'no'.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I see it has several rows with different browsers and their details. Let me go through each row to find where the stable release matches \"4.2.1 Jelly Bean\".\n\nRow 1: Browser is android browser, OS is android, latest stable release is exactly \"4.2.1 jelly bean (november 27, 2012)\". Okay, so this seems to be the one we're looking at.\n\nNow, checking the h264 and vp9 (webm) for this row:\n- h264: 3.0\n- vp9 (webm): no\n\nWait a minute, according to the claim, h264 should be 9.0, but in row 1 it's 3.0. That doesn't match. The vp9 is 'no', which matches the claim.\n\nBut since the h264 value is incorrect (it's 3.0 instead of 9.0), the entire condition isn't met. So the claim would be FALSE because one of its conditions isn't satisfied.\n\nLet me double-check other rows to make sure there isn't another entry with the same stable version but different values. Looking through rows 2 to 9, none of them have \"4.2.1 jelly bean\" as their latest stable release except row 1. So, row 1 is the only relevant one.\n\nThus, since h264 is not 9.0 in that row, the claim isn't fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states specific values for a particular browser version. Checking the table, the android browser's stable release matches the date and version, but the h264 value doesn't match.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"latest stable release\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"h264\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"vp9 (webm)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
