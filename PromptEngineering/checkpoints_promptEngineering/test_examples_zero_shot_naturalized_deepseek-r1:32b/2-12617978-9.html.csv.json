    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine if the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. \n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"beach break live / cone timentrate design be invest in by peter jones with more than 35000 request.\" It looks like there's a typo in \"cone timentrate design,\" which I assume should be \"concentrate design\" based on the table.\n\nNext, I'll look at the table provided. The relevant columns here are \"company or product name,\" \"money requested,\" and \"investing dragon(s).\" \n\nLooking for \"beach break live,\" I find it in Row 1. The money requested is \u00a350,000, which is more than \u00a335,000, and Peter Jones is the investing dragon. So that part checks out.\n\nNow, checking for \"concentrate design\" (assuming that's what was meant), I look at Row 5. It shows that the money requested was \u00a3100,000, which is also more than \u00a335,000, and Peter Jones invested here as well.\n\nBoth companies mentioned in the claim were indeed invested in by Peter Jones with requests over \u00a335,000. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly states that both \"beach break live\" and \"concentrate design\" received investments from Peter Jones with money requested exceeding \u00a335,000.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"company or product name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"money requested\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"investing dragon(s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"company or product name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"money requested\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"investing dragon(s)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"reestore request 50000 from deborah meaden & theo paphitis\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n1. The company/product name: reestore.\n2. The amount requested: 50000.\n3. The investing dragons: Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis.\n\nNow, I need to check each of these elements against the table rows to see if they match.\n\nLooking at row 6 in the table:\n- Episode: episode 4\n- First aired: 5 November 2007\n- Entrepreneurs: Max McMurdo\n- Company/product name: reestore\n- Money requested: 50000\n- Investing dragons: Deborah Meaden & Theo Paphitis\n\nThis matches all parts of the claim. The company is \"reestore,\" they requested exactly 50,000, and both Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis are listed as investing dragons.\n\nSo, each part of the claim is correctly represented in row 6. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells from this row include:\n- The product name \"reestore\" under company or product name.\n- The money requested amount of 50000.\n- The investing dragons Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis.\n\nThese are all necessary to confirm that the claim aligns with the data in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"game alert ask for 200000\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The key parts are \"game alert\" and asking for 200,000. So, I need to check if there's an entry in the table where a company or product named \"Game Alert\" requested that amount of money.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with details about entrepreneurs, their companies, the money they asked for, and the investing dragons. My goal is to find any row where the company/product name matches \"game alert\" (case-insensitive) and the money requested is 200,000.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- Row 1: Company is Beach Break Live. Doesn't match.\n- Row 2: Goldgenie (formerly Midas Touch). Nope.\n- Row 3: Youdoodoll. Not relevant.\n- Row 4: Gaming Alerts. Wait, that's close to Game Alert. Let me check the money requested here. It says 200000, which is exactly what the claim mentions.\n- Rows 5 to 14: None of these have a company name that matches \"game alert.\" \n\nSo, in Row 4, under Episode 2, the entrepreneur(s) are Emmie Matthews & Ed Stevens with the product Gaming Alerts. They requested 200,000. The claim says \"game alert ask for 200000,\" which seems to match exactly.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the relevant row has the company name and the exact amount mentioned.\n</think>\n\nThe claim matches Row 4 where Gaming Alerts requested \u00a3200,000.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"company or product name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"money requested\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"in episode 7, 145000 be the highest amount of money request by jerry mantalvanos & paul merker.\"\n\nFirst, let me check which row(s) in the table correspond to episode 7. Looking through the rows, I see that episodes are listed from 1 to 9. Specifically, rows 11 and 12 are for episode 7.\n\nRow 11: Entrepreneurs are Sammy French, company Fit Fur Life, money requested is 100000, investing dragons are James Caan.\n\nRow 12: Entrepreneurs are Jerry Mantalvanos & Paul Merker, company JPM Eco Logistics, money requested is 100000, investing dragons are Deborah Meaden & Theo Paphitis.\n\nSo in episode 7, there are two entrepreneurs who each requested \u00a3100,000. The claim mentions that Jerry Mantalvanos & Paul Merker requested \u00a3145,000 as the highest amount. \n\nWait a second, looking at row 12, the money requested is 100000, not 145000. So the amount in the claim doesn't match what's in the table.\n\nAlso, checking all rows for episode 7 (rows 11 and 12), neither of them have a request of \u00a3145,000. The highest in episode 7 is \u00a3100,000 from both entrepreneurs.\n\nTherefore, the claim that they requested \u00a3145,000 is incorrect because it's actually \u00a3100,000. Also, since both in episode 7 asked for the same amount, there isn't a higher one beyond that.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Jerry Mantalvanos & Paul Merker requested \u00a3145,000 in episode 7 as the highest amount. However, according to row 12 of the table, they requested \u00a3100,000. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"money requested\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, \"game alert\" refers to a company or product name in the table. Looking through the rows, I see that Row 4 mentions \"gaming alerts.\" So that's the relevant row here.\n\nThe claim says that gaming alerts asked for the least amount of money.
