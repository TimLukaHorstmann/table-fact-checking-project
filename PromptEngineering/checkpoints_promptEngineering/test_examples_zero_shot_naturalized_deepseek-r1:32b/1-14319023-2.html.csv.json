The claim says: \"when the girl single be lindaweni fanetri , the mixed double be wifqi windarto debby susanto\".\n\nFirst, let me break down what this means. It's saying that in the same year where the Girls Singles champion was Lindaweni Fanetri, the Mixed Doubles champions were Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table to find the year when Lindaweni Fanetri won the Girls Singles. Scanning through Rows 1 to 10:\n\n- Row 7 (Year: 2007) has \"lindaweni fanetri\" listed under Girls Singles.\n  \nNow, I need to check what the Mixed Doubles champions were in that same year, which is 2007.

The claim says: \"when the girl double be ayu pratiwi anggi widia , the boy double be jones ralfy jansen and dandi prabudita.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down what the claim is stating. It mentions a specific pair in the girls doubles and expects that in the same year, the boys doubles have another specific pair.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each row (year) to see if there's a match where the girl double is \"ayu pratiwi anggi widia\" and simultaneously the boy double is \"jones ralfy jansen and dandi prabudita.\"\n\nStarting from Row 1 (2001), I scan through each year. Let me go row by row:\n\n- **Row 1 (2001):** Girl doubles are lilyana natsir natalia poluakan. Boys doubles: hendra setiawan joko riyadi. Doesn't match.\n  \n- **Row 2 (2002):** Girl doubles: purwati meiliana jauhari. Boy doubles: ujang suherlan yoga ukikasah. No match.\n\n- **Row 3 (2003):** Girl doubles: pia zebadiah nitya krishinda maheswari. Boys doubles: fran kurniawan chandra kowi. Still no.\n\n- **Row 4 (2004):** Girl doubles: same as Row 3, pia and nitya. Boy doubles: aditya dwi putra i made agung. Not matching.\n\n- **Row 5 (2005):** Girl doubles: lily siswanti shendy puspa irawati. Boys doubles: rio willianto davin prawidssa. No match.\n\n- **Row 6 (2006):** Girl doubles: bellaetrix manuputty samantha lintang. Boy doubles: Danny Bawa Chrisnanta Afiat Yuris Wirawan. Not the pair we're looking for.\n\n- **Row 7 (2007):** Girl doubles: anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati. Boys doubles: budi hartono yohanes rendy sugiarto. Still no match.\n\n- **Row 8 (2008):** Girl doubles: suci rizki andini tiara rosalia nuraidah. Boy doubles: didit juang indrianto seiko wahyu kusdianto. Not matching.\n\n- **Row 9 (2009):** Here, the girl doubles are ayu pratiwi anggi widia \u2013 this is the first part of our claim. Now I check the boy doubles for that same row. It says jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita. Wait, that's exactly the pair mentioned in the claim: Jones Ralfy Jansen and Dandi Prabudita.\n\n- **Row 10 (2010):** Girl doubles are aris budiharti dian fitriani. Boys doubles again have jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita, but since in Row 9 we found the exact match, this is not needed for verification of the claim.\n\nSo, in Row 9 (2009), both conditions are met: the girl double is \"ayu pratiwi anggi widia\" and the boy double is \"jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita.\" Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"girls doubles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"boys doubles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"in 2006, the mixed double be danny bawa chrisnanta debby susanto and the boy single be nugroho andi saputro.\" \n\nFirst, I'll check each part of the claim step by step.\n\nThe first part is about the mixed doubles in 2006. Looking at the table, I find row 6 corresponds to the year 2006. In that row, under the 'mixed doubles' column, it says \"danny bawa chrisnanta debby susanto.\" This matches exactly with what's stated in the claim, so this part is correct.\n\nNext, the second part mentions the boys singles in 2006. Again, looking at row 6, the 'boys singles' column lists \"nugroho andi saputro,\" which also aligns perfectly with the claim. \n\nSince both pieces of information from the claim are correctly represented in the table for the year 2006, there's no discrepancy.

Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"when the girl single be lindaweni fanetri , the mixed double be wifqi windarto debby susanto after the year 2007\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse each part of the claim:\n\n1. The girl singles player is Lindaweni Fanetri.\n2. In that same row (year), the mixed doubles pair should be Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto.\n3. This situation occurs after the year 2007.\n\nI'll start by looking for Lindaweni Fanetri in the 'girls singles' column across all rows.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 1 (2001): Maria Kristin Yulianti\n- Row 2 (2002): Fransisca Ratnasari\n- Row 3 (2003): Wiwis Meilyanna\n- Row 4 (2004): Pia Zebadiah\n- Row 5 (2005): Bellaetrix Manuputty\n- Row 6 (2006): Sylvinna Kurniawan\n- Row 7 (2007): Lindaweni Fanetri \u2192 Found her here.\n- Rows 8-10: Other players, but not Lindaweni.\n\nSo, Lindaweni Fanetri is in row 7 for the year 2007. The claim mentions \"after the year 2007,\" which would mean years 2008 and beyond. However, Lindaweni only appears in 2007. \n\nNext, checking the mixed doubles pair in row 7: Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto are indeed listed there. But since this is in 2007, it doesn't meet the \"after 2007\" condition.\n\nLooking at rows after 2007 (rows 8-10), I don't see Lindaweni Fanetri in any of them. Therefore, there's no occurrence where Lindaweni is the girl singles player and the mixed doubles pair is Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto in a year after 2007.\n\nHence, the claim isn't supported by the table because although the conditions are met in 2007, it doesn't satisfy the \"after 2007\" requirement.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a scenario that occurs in 2007 but requires it to happen after that year.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. The claim states: \"In 2007, the girl double was Anneke Feinya Agustin Wenny Setiawati and the mixed double was Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanto.\"\n\nI'll need to verify both parts of this statement against the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a year from 2001 to 2010. Each row has columns for Year, Boys Singles, Girls Singles, Boys Doubles, Girls Doubles, and Mixed Doubles.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific pieces of information:\n1. The girl doubles team in 2007.\n2. The mixed doubles team in 2007.\n\nSo, I should focus on the row corresponding to the year 2007.\n\nLooking at Row 7 (since rows are indexed starting from 0, but assuming the first row is index 1? Wait no, actually in programming, indexes usually start at 0. Let me check:\n\nWait, let's recount the rows as given:\nRow 1: Year 2001\nRow 2: Year 2002\n...\nSo Row 7 would be year 2007.\n\nLooking at Row 7 (year 2007):\n- Girls Doubles: anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati\n- Mixed Doubles: wifqi windarto debby susanto\n\nComparing this to the claim, both parts match exactly. So the claim is accurate based on the data provided.\n\nNow, regarding the \"relevant_cells\", I need to note which cells were checked. For the girls doubles, that's the Girls Doubles column in row 7 (assuming rows are 1-indexed as per the user's description). Similarly, mixed doubles is also in the same row under Mixed Doubles.\n\nWait, but in the initial problem statement, it says \"Row 1\", \"Row 2\", etc., which suggests that each row is labeled from 1 onwards. Therefore, for 2007, it would be Row 7 (since 2001 is Row 1, so 2007 is Row 7). So the relevant cells are in row index 6 if starting from 0? Wait no, perhaps the user counts rows as per their given list. Let me see.\n\nIn the table provided, Row 1 corresponds to year 2001, which would be considered as row index 0 in a zero-based system. However, when the user refers to \"row_1\", they might mean the first row, so perhaps it's better to use their row numbering directly. So for the claim about 2007, that is Row 7 as per the user's enumeration.\n\nTherefore, relevant cells are:\n- For Girls Doubles in 2007: column \"girls doubles\", row index 6 (assuming zero-based) or row index 7 if one-based.\nWait, this could be confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nIn programming, when using JSON and such, it's common to use zero-based indexing. However, the user's table lists Row 1 as year 2001, so perhaps in their context, rows are numbered starting at 1. Therefore, for 2007, which is the 7th row (since 2001 is row 1), it would be row index 6 if zero-based or row_7 if one-based.\n\nWait, but looking back at the user's example in the problem statement:\n\nThey gave an example with \"row_index\": 0 and 1. So perhaps they are using zero-based indexing for rows as well. Therefore, year 2001 is row index 0 (Row 1), 2002 is row index 1 (Row 2), ..., 2007 would be row index 6 (since 2001 is 0, 2002 is 1,..., 2007 is 6).\n\nSo for the claim in 2007, which is Row 7 in their description but row_index 6 in zero-based:\n\nGirls Doubles: column \"girls doubles\" at row index 6.\nMixed Doubles: column \"mixed doubles\" at row index 6.\n\nThus, relevant_cells would be:\n[\n {\"row_1\": 6, \"column_name\": \"girls doubles\"},\n {\"row_1\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}\n]\n\nWait, but in the example, they used row_index, not row_1. So perhaps it's better to represent it as row_index.\n\nBut looking at the user's instruction: in their example JSON, they have keys like \"row_1\" and \"row_index\". Wait no, looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement, the user provided an example with:\n{\n  \"result\": \"True\",\n  \"explanation\": \"...\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_1\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Employees\"},\n    {\"row_1\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nWait no, actually in the example, they have keys like \"row_index\". Let me check:\n\nIn the problem statement's example:\n{\n  \"result\": true,\n  \"explanation\": \"...\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Employees\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nSo in their JSON structure, the key is \"row_index\", not \"row_1\" or anything else. So we should use \"row_index\" with zero-based numbering.\n\nTherefore, for 2007, which is Row 7 as per user's initial list (Row 1:2001), it would be row index 6 in the JSON.\n\nSo relevant_cells would include two entries:\n- For Girls Doubles: row_index 6, column \"girls doubles\"\n- For Mixed Doubles: row_index 6, column \"mixed doubles\"\n\nThus, the final JSON should have these entries under relevant_cells.\n</think>\n\n{\"result\": true, \"explanation\": \"The claim is TRUE.

Looking at the rows, Row 10 corresponds to the year 2010. That's where I should focus.\n\nNow, looking at the columns in that row: \n- The girl doubles are listed as \"aris budiharti dian fitriani.\" Wait a minute, that doesn't match the claim which says \"ayu pratiwi anggi widia.\" So that seems off. \n- For the boys doubles, it's \"jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita,\" which matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nHmm, so the girls doubles part is incorrect according to the table. The girl doubles in 2010 were aris budiharti and dian fitriani, not ayu pratiwi anggi widia as claimed. So because part of the claim doesn't align with the table data, the entire statement isn't true.\n\nI think I should double-check to make sure I didn't mix up any rows or columns.

So yes, the claim is incorrect regarding the girl doubles.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions \"ayu pratiwi anggi widia\" for girls doubles in 2010, which doesn't match the table where it's \"aris budiharti dian fitriani.\" However, the boys doubles are correct.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through each part of the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states two things for the year 2009:\n1. The mixed double consists of \"didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu\".\n2. \"hermansyah\" is the boy single.\n\nFirst, I'll check the year 2009 in the table. Looking at row 8 (since rows are zero-indexed, but wait, actually looking back, no\u2014the user provided rows from 1 to 10. Wait, no, in their naturalized format, they list rows as Row 1 through Row 10, each with a year. So for the claim about 2009, I need to find row where year is 2009.\n\nLooking at each row:\nRow 1: 2001\nRow 2: 2002\nRow 3: 2003\nRow 4: 2004\nRow 5: 2005\nRow 6: 2006\nRow 7: 2007\nRow 8: 2008\nRow 9: 2009\nRow 10: 2010\n\nSo, the 2009 data is in Row 9 (since counting from 1). Now, looking at row 9:\n\n- boys singles: riyanto subagja\n- girls singles: ana rovita\n- mixed doubles: didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu\n\nWait, no\u2014the columns are as follows. Each row has:\nyear, boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, mixed doubles.\n\nSo for Row 9 (2009), the mixed doubles are \"didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu\". So that part of the claim is correct: yes, in 2009, the mixed doubles were didit juang and indrianto yayu rahayu. Or wait, looking at the data, it's written as \"didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu\"\u2014but actually, the table shows mixed doubles as \"didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu\". So that part is correct.\n\nNow, for the second part of the claim: hermansyah being the boy single in 2009. Looking at row 9's boys singles column, it says riyanto subagja. So hermansyah is not listed as the boys singles champion in 2009; instead, he was the champion in 2008 (row 8). Therefore, this part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo overall, the claim has two parts:\n1. Mixed doubles: correct.\n2. Boys singles: incorrect.\n\nSince both conditions must be true for the entire claim to be TRUE, but one is false, the overall answer should be FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- For mixed doubles in 2009: row 9, mixed doubles column.\n- For boys singles in 2009: row 9, boys singles column.\n\nSo the JSON response will list these two cells as relevant and mark the answer as FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"boys singles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"In 2010, when mixed double be danny bawa chrisnanta and debby susanto, the boy single be nugroho andi saputro.\"\n\nFirst, I'll check for the year 2010 in the table. Looking at row indices, each row represents a year starting from 2001 (row 0) up to 2010 (row 9).\n\nFor 2010 (row 9), let's look at the mixed doubles entry. The mixed doubles are listed as \"jones ralfy jansen nurbeta kwanrico.\" So, in row 9, column 'mixed doubles' doesn't have danny bawa chrisnanta and debby susanto.\n\nNext, I'll check if nugroho andi saputro was the boys singles winner in 2010. In row 9, under 'boys singles', it's listed as shesar hiren rhustavito, not nugroho andi saputro.\n\nWait a minute, when did nugroho andi saputro win? Let me check other rows. Looking back at row 6 (year 2006), the boys singles winner is indeed nugroho andi saputro. So in 2010, it's someone else.\n\nTherefore, the claim incorrectly states that in 2010, mixed doubles were danny bawa chrisnanta and debby susanto (which was actually in row 6 for 2006) and claims nugroho was boys singles in 2010 (he wasn't; he was in 2006). So both parts of the claim are incorrect for 2010.\n\nSo, the relevant cells to check were row 9's 'mixed doubles' and 'boys singles', as well as any other rows where danny bawa chrisnanta appears.

Let me check the table for row 9 which is year 2009. The girls doubles are listed as Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia. But in the claim, it's Anneke Feinya Agustin Wenny Setiawati. That doesn't match.\n\nWait a second, maybe I'm mixing up rows. Let me check again. Row 8 is 2008, row 9 is 2009, and row 10 is 2010. So in 2009 (row 9), the girls doubles are Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia. The claim says Anneke Feinya Agustin Wenny Setiawati, which I think appears in row 7 (2007). That's different.\n\nAlso, the mixed double for 2009 is Didit Juang Indrianto Yayu Rahayu according to row 9. But the claim mentions Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanto, which I believe is from row 7 as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing rows. Let me check each year carefully:\n\n- For 2009 (row 9), girls doubles: Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia\n- Mixed doubles: Didit Juang Indrianto Yayu Rahayu\n\nThe claim says in 2009, the girl's double was Anneke Feinya Agustin Wenny Setiawati and mixed doubles were Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanto. Those details don't align with row 9.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. Oh no, wait: The claim actually might be about different years? No, it's specifically 2009. So the claim is incorrect because in 2009, those specific pairs aren't listed as winners.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE. Relevant cells are row 9 for girls doubles and mixed doubles.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"girls doubles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
