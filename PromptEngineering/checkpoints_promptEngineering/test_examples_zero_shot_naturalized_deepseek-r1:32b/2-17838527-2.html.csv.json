    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. There are five rows, each representing a rank from 1 to 5. Each row has columns for gold, silver, bronze, and total medals. The total seems to be the sum of all medal counts in that row.\n\nNow, looking at the claim: \"rank 1 with a total of more than 21 medal, total gold medal be 13.\" \n\nI need to break this down into two parts:\n1. Rank 1 has a total of more than 21 medals.\n2. The total number of gold medals is 13.\n\nLet me check each part against the table data.\n\nStarting with the first condition: Rank 1's total medals. From Row 1, rank 1 has a total of 22 medals (as listed in the 'total' column). The claim states that this total is more than 21. Since 22 is indeed greater than 21, the first part checks out.\n\nNext, the second condition: Total gold medals being 13. Looking at Row 1 again, under the 'gold' column, rank 1 has exactly 13 gold medals. This matches the claim perfectly.\n\nSo both conditions in the claim are satisfied based on the data provided in the table. Therefore, the claim should be considered TRUE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells for each condition:\n- For the total medal count (more than 21), I need to look at Row 1's 'total' column.\n- For the gold medals being 13, I check Row 1's 'gold' column.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are in Row 1 under both 'total' and 'gold'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"rank 3 have 6 total medal\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by carefully examining the table provided.\n\nThe table has five rows, each representing a rank from 1 to 5. Each row includes columns for gold, silver, bronze, and total medals. The task is to verify if rank 3 indeed has a total of 6 medals.\n\nLooking at the third row (since rank starts at 1), which should be index 2 because we usually count rows starting from 0 in programming contexts. Wait, no\u2014let me clarify: the first row is rank 1, so it's index 0; the second row is rank 2, index 1; and the third row is rank 3, index 2.\n\nIn that third row, I see the numbers for gold, silver, bronze, and total. The claim states that rank 3 has a total of 6 medals. Let me check the 'total' column for that row. According to the table, the total is 16, not 6. \n\nSo, the claim says 6, but the actual total is 16. That's a clear discrepancy. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nTo support this, I need to identify which cells were relevant. The key cell here is the 'total' column in the row where rank is 3, which is at index 2.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks the total medals for rank 3 against the table and finds it incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
