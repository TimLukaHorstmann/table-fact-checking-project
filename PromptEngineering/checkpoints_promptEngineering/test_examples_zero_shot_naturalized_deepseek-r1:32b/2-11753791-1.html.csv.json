    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the team with 3 loss have 0 tie\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It states that any team that has exactly 3 losses must also have 0 ties. So I need to check each row in the table where the number of losses is 3 and see if the corresponding ties are indeed 0 for those teams.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five rows, each representing a different team with their respective statistics:\n\nRow 1: Montreal Hockey Club \u2013 Losses: 3, Ties: 0\nRow 2: Ottawa Hockey Club \u2013 Losses: 3, Ties: 0\nRow 3: Montreal Victorias \u2013 Losses: 3, Ties: 0\nRow 4: Quebec Hockey Club \u2013 Losses: 3, Ties: 0\nRow 5: Montreal Crystals \u2013 Losses: 8, Ties: 0\n\nThe claim is about teams with exactly 3 losses. So I can ignore Row 5 since it has 8 losses. Let's check Rows 1 to 4.\n\nFor each of these rows:\n- Montreal Hockey Club (Row 1): Losses = 3, Ties = 0\n- Ottawa Hockey Club (Row 2): Losses = 3, Ties = 0\n- Montreal Victorias (Row 3): Losses = 3, Ties = 0\n- Quebec Hockey Club (Row 4): Losses = 3, Ties = 0\n\nIn all four cases, whenever a team has exactly 3 losses, the number of ties is indeed 0. There's no instance where a team with 3 losses has any ties. \n\nTherefore, the claim holds true for all applicable rows in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that teams with 3 losses have 0 ties. Checking each relevant row confirms this.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"ties\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ties\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"ties\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"ties\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
