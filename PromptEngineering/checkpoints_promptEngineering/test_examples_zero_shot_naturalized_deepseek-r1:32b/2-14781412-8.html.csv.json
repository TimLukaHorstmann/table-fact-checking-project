    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"Equestrian at the Asian Games happen every 4 years from 1982 to 2010, except for in 1990.\"\n\nFirst, I'll check if there are entries every four years starting from 1982 and ending in 2010. The table shows events in 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010.\n\nLooking at the years:\n- 1982 is listed (Row 1)\n- Next should be 1986 (four years later) which is present in Row 2\n- Then comes 1990. However, there's no row for 1990. The next year after 1986 is 1994 (eight years later), which skips 1990.\n- Continuing, the subsequent years are 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010.\n\nThe claim mentions that it happens every four years except in 1990. Since there's no event in 1990 as per the table, but all other events follow a four-year interval starting from 1982 up to 2010 (with 1994 being eight years after 1986, which skips 1990), this aligns with the claim that it's every four years except in 1990.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are all the 'year' columns from each row to check the intervals between events.\n</think>\n\nThe equestrian events occur every four years as per the table, skipping 1990.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says that \"equestrian at the asian games have been located in a different city every year that it occurs.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It seems like it's saying that each time equestrian events happened in the Asian Games, they were held in a new city each year. So, for every occurrence of equestrian events, the location (city) was different.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents an instance of the event with details like year, location, and medalists. The relevant information here would be the 'year' and 'location' columns because those directly relate to whether each event took place in a unique city each year.\n\nLet me list out the years and locations from each row:\n\n1. 1982 - New Delhi\n2. 1986 - Seoul\n3. 1994 - Hiroshima\n4. 1998 - Bangkok\n5. 2002 - Busan\n6. 2006 - Doha\n7. 2010 - Guangzhou\n\nNow, I need to check if each location is unique across all the years. Starting from 1982, New Delhi was used once in that year. Then in 1986, it's Seoul\u2014different city. Next, 1994 is Hiroshima; not seen before. In 1998, Bangkok is new. 2002 is Busan\u2014a different location. Doha in 2006 hasn't appeared earlier, and finally, Guangzhou in 2010 is another unique city.\n\nSince each of the locations from 1982 to 2010 are distinct and there's no repetition of any city across the years listed, it appears that the equestrian events were indeed held in a different city every year they occurred. Therefore, the claim seems to be true based on this data.\n\nI should also make sure that I'm not missing anything else. The table doesn't have multiple entries for the same year or any repeated cities, so there's no conflicting information. Each row clearly shows a unique combination of year and location without overlaps.\n\nSo, considering all this, the relevant cells are the 'location' column across all rows because each entry must be checked to ensure they're all different. Since every location is unique per year, the claim holds.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It states that Nadia Al-Moutawaa was the first person to win a gold medal in equestrian events at the Asian Games. To verify this, I should look into the table provided and check if she indeed won a gold medal in equestrian and whether she was the first.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year with details about gold, silver, and bronze medalists. The years listed are 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010. Each row has columns for year, location, gold, silver, and bronze.\n\nI need to check if Nadia Al-Moutawaa is listed as a gold medalist in any of these years, particularly focusing on equestrian events. Let's go through each row:\n\n- Row 1 (1982): Gold medalist is Nadia Al-Moutawaa.\n- The other rows don't mention her.\n\nSo, in the table provided, Nadia Al-Moutawaa won a gold medal in 1982. Now, I need to determine if this was indeed the first time someone won a gold medal in equestrian at the Asian Games.\n\nLooking at the years before 1982, there are no entries, so 1982 is the earliest year listed where she won. Since she's the first person mentioned as a gold medalist in any of the rows, it seems that she was the first to win gold in equestrian according to this table.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the claim appears to be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table where Nadia Al-Moutawaa won gold in 1982, which is the earliest year listed.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It's stating that each year the Asian Games were held, the person who won the gold medal in equestrian was different; there were no repeat winners in any of those years.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists the years from 1982 to 2010, and for each year, it gives the location, gold, silver, and bronze medalists. Each row represents a different Asian Games event across these years.\n\nI need to check the gold medalist in each row to see if they are all unique or if any repeat. Let's go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Year 1982 - Gold: Nadia al-Moutawaa\nRow 2: Year 1986 - Gold: Takashi Tomura\nRow 3: Year 1994 - Gold: Konoshin Kuwahara\nRow 4: Year 1998 - Gold: Jin Kanno\nRow 5: Year 2002 - Gold: Mikaela Mar\u00e3\u00ada Jaworski (I think this might be a typo, maybe Mikaela Maria Jaworski)\nRow 6: Year 2006 - Gold: Ali Yousuf al-Rumaihi\nRow 7: Year 2010 - Gold: Ramzy al Duhami\n\nNow, let's list all the gold medalists to check for duplicates:\n\nNadia al-Moutawaa (1982)\nTakashi Tomura (1986)\nKonoshin Kuwahara (1994)\nJin Kanno (1998)\nMikaela Mar\u00e3\u00ada Jaworski (2002) - Assuming this is a correct name despite the odd character\nAli Yousuf al-Rumaihi (2006)\nRamzy al Duhami (2010)\n\nLooking at these names, each one seems unique.

The claim says that South Korea is the only country to have hosted equestrian events more than once, specifically mentioning Seoul and Doha, but also noting Incheon elsewhere.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the table correctly. Each row represents a different year, location, and medalists in equestrian events. My task is to check which locations are associated with South Korea.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Row 2: Year 1986, Location Seoul \u2013 that's South Korea.\n- Row 5: Year 2002, Location Busan \u2013 also South Korea.\n- Row 6: Year 2006, Location Doha \u2013 which is in Qatar, not South Korea.\n\nWait a minute, the claim mentions Seoul and Doha as hosts by South Korea. But from the table, Doha isn't a South Korean location; it's in Qatar. So that part of the claim might be incorrect based on this data.\n\nAdditionally, the user notes Incheon elsewhere but that doesn't appear in our table. However, focusing on what's provided:\n\nSouth Korea hosted in Seoul (1986) and Busan (2002). That's two instances. The next host after 2002 would be Incheon in 2014, which isn't listed here, but that's outside the given data.\n\nThe claim says South Korea is the only country with multiple hosts, specifically Seoul and Doha. But according to the table, Doha was hosted by Qatar, not South Korea. Therefore, the part about Doha being a South Korean host is false.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are the locations in rows 2 and 5 (Seoul and Busan). Since the claim incorrectly includes Doha as a South Korean host, which isn't supported by the table, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_1dex\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_1dex\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is about whether equestrian events at the Asian Games happened every four years from 1982 to 2010. I'll need to verify this using the provided table.\n\nFirst, I should look at the years listed in the table. The rows are:\n\n- 1982\n- 1986\n- 1994\n- 1998\n- 2002\n- 2006\n- 2010\n\nNow, let's check the intervals between these years to see if they are every four years.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1986 is 4 years. That fits.\nFrom 1986 to 1994 is 8 years. That's a gap of eight years, which doesn't fit the every-four-years pattern.\nHmm, so this might already indicate that the claim isn't entirely true.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recount: 1982, then next in 1986 (4 years later), then 1990 is missing. The next event listed is 1994, which would be 8 years after 1986. So that's a gap of eight years instead of four.\n\nBut maybe the Asian Games don't have equestrian events every year? Wait, I think the Asian Games themselves are held every four years, but perhaps equestrian is an event that might not be included in each edition or there could be gaps due to various reasons like organizational issues, funding, etc.\n\nLooking back at the claim: it says \"equestrian at the asian game happen every 4 year from 1982 to 2010.\" So according to the table, equestrian events are listed for 1982, then again in 1986. Then the next is 1994\u2014so that's a gap of eight years between 1986 and 1994. That breaks the every-four-years pattern.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there were equestrian events in 1990 as well, which aren't listed here. However, based solely on this table, we don't have data for 1990. So according to the information given, there's a gap of eight years between 1986 and 1994.\n\nTherefore, the claim that they happen every four years isn't fully supported by the provided data because there are intervals longer than four years (like from 1986 to 1994) and some years missing in the table. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells for checking the timeline of equestrian events at the Asian Games are the 'year' column across all rows.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Check the Years:** Look at each row's year to determine the intervals between events.\n2. **Calculate Intervals:** Calculate the time between consecutive years (e.g., 1986 - 1982 = 4 years).\n3. **Identify Gaps:** Notice that some intervals are longer than four years (e.g., 1994 - 1986 = 8 years), indicating gaps.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since not all events occurred every four years, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine whether the claim \"Equestrian at the Asian Game have be locate in a different city every year that it occur except 1994 and 1998\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asserting. It says that each year, the equestrian event of the Asian Games was held in a different city, except for two years: 1994 and 1998. So, according to this claim, all other years should have unique cities, while 1994 and 1998 might share their locations.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\n- **Row 1 (1982)**: New Delhi\n- **Row 2 (1986)**: Seoul\n- **Row 3 (1994)**: Hiroshima\n- **Row 4 (1998)**: Bangkok\n- **Row 5 (2002)**: Busan\n- **Row 6 (2006)**: Doha\n- **Row 7 (2010)**: Guangzhou\n\nNow, I'll list out the cities by year to check for any repetitions except possibly in 1994 and 1998.\n\nStarting from Row 1:\n- 1982: New Delhi\n- 1986: Seoul \u2192 Different from previous\n- 1994: Hiroshima \u2192 Different from all before\n- 1998: Bangkok \u2192 Different from all before\n- 2002: Busan \u2192 Different\n- 2006: Doha \u2192 Different\n- 2010: Guangzhou \u2192 Different\n\nWait a minute, I don't see any repeated cities except for checking if 1994 and 1998 are the same. But looking at their locations:\n\n- 1994: Hiroshima\n- 1998: Bangkok\n\nThese are two distinct cities. So both 1994 and 1998 have unique locations, not shared with any other year.\n\nThe claim states that except for 1994 and 1998, all other years were in different cities. But according to the table, all years from 1982 onward have different host cities. There are no two years with the same city except if we look at 1994 and 1998 again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the claim. It says \"except 1994 and 1998,\" implying that these two years might share a location. But in reality, their locations are different (Hiroshima vs. Bangkok). Therefore, all years have unique cities without any repeats. This means that the exception mentioned in the claim doesn't hold because there were no two years with the same city.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect. The actual data shows every year's location was unique, so the exception stated in the claim (1994 and 1998) isn't applicable since those years didn't share a location.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that 1994 and 1998 shared a location when they actually did not. All years have distinct cities.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Wait, no, actually, looking again: in Row 1, it's gold: nadia, silver: jamila, bronze: bariaa. So, Jamila won silver that year.\n\nWait a minute, I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check each row:\n\n- 1982: Nadia (gold), Jamila (silver)\n- 1986: Takashi Tomura (gold), Shuichi Toki (silver)\n- 1994: Konoshin Kuwahara (gold), Ryuzo Okuno (silver)\n- 1998: Jin Kanno (gold), Sohn Bong-gak (silver)\n- 2002: Mikaela Mar\u00e3\u00ada Jaworski (gold), Lee Jin-Kyung (silver)\n- 2006: Ali Yousef Al-Rumaihi (gold), Jasmine Chen-Shao Man (silver)\n- 2010: Ramzy Al Duhami (gold), Latifa Al Maktom (silver)\n\nSo, looking through all the silver medalists, I don't see Nadia's name again. That means she didn't win a silver in another year.\n\nWait, but in Row 1, Jamila is listed as silver. So, perhaps there was confusion earlier. Let me re-examine: The claim says she won gold once and silver another year. But according to the table, Nadia only appears once as a gold medalist (Row 1) and does not appear again in any other category except for the same row's silver, which is Jamila.\n\nTherefore, the claim that she won gold and then silver in another year isn't supported by the data provided. The second part of the claim is false because Nadia only has a single entry as gold and doesn't have any silver medals in different years.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states two points: first, that Nadia Al-Moutawaa was the first to win gold in equestrian, which is correct from Row 1. Second, she won silver another year, but checking all other rows, she isn't listed as a silver medalist elsewhere.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n     {\"row__index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is about South Korea hosting equestrian events at the Asian Games more than once, specifically mentioning Seoul twice. I need to check if this claim holds true based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the table to identify where South Korea was the host. Scanning through the 'location' column:\n\n- Row 1: New Delhi (India)\n- Row 2: Seoul (South Korea) - that's one occurrence.\n- Rows 3 and 4 are Hiroshima (Japan) and Bangkok (Thailand), respectively.\n- Row 5 is Busan, which is also in South Korea. So that's a second occurrence.\n- The rest of the rows don't mention any other South Korean locations.\n\nSo, from the table, South Korea hosted equestrian events twice: once in Seoul (1986) and again in Busan (2002). \n\nNow, checking if it's the only country to host more than once. Looking at all the locations:\n- New Delhi (India)\n- Seoul (South Korea)\n- Hiroshima (Japan)\n- Bangkok (Thailand)\n- Busan (South Korea)\n- Doha (Qatar)\n- Guangzhou (China)\n\nEach location appears only once except for South Korea, which appears twice under different cities. Therefore, no other country has hosted more than once based on this table.\n\nThe claim specifies \"in Seoul 2 time,\" but in reality, South Korea hosted twice in different cities: Seoul and Busan. However, the claim's main point is about hosting more than once, regardless of the specific city. Since it does so only in South Korea, the first part is true. But the second part incorrectly states it was in Seoul twice. \n\nWait, but according to the table, Seoul hosted in 1986 and Busan in 2002. So South Korea did host twice, but not both times in Seoul. The claim says \"South Korea be the only country to have host equestrian at the Asian Game more than 1 time, in seoul 2 time.\" This implies that it was hosted twice in Seoul. But the table shows only one instance in Seoul (Row 2) and another in Busan (Row 5). Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it wasn't hosted twice in Seoul; it was hosted twice in South Korea but in two different cities.\n\nSo, the first part of the claim that South Korea is the only country to host more than once is true. However, the second part about hosting twice in Seoul is false. Since both conditions need to be correct for the overall claim to be true, and one part is incorrect, the entire claim should be evaluated as FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are Rows 2 (Seoul) and Row 5 (Busan), specifically the 'location' column.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_5\", \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the gold medalist for equestrian at the Asian Game have been different in every year they have occurred except 1994 and 1998.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It's saying that each year, the gold medalist was a different person except for two years: 1994 and 1998. That would mean in 1994 and 1998, there were repeat gold medalists, while all other years had unique winners.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year with the gold medalist's name. So I need to check the gold column across all rows to see if any names are repeated except possibly in 1994 and 1998.\n\nLet me list out the gold medalists:\n\n- 1982: Nadia Al-Moutawaa\n- 1986: Takashi Tomura\n- 1994: Konoshin Kuwahara\n- 1998: Jin Kanno\n- 2002: Mikaela Mar\u00eda Jaworski\n- 2006: Ali Yousuf Al-Rumaihi\n- 2010: Ramzy Al Duhami\n\nNow, I need to check for any duplicates. Scanning through the names:\n\nNadia Al-Moutawaa appears only in 1982.\n\nTakashi Tomura is only in 1986.\n\nKonoshin Kuwahara is in 1994, and looking at other rows, no one else has that name except in 1994. Wait, but the claim mentions 1994 and 1998 as exceptions. So I need to check if either of these years have the same gold medalist.\n\nWait, Konoshin Kuwahara is only listed once in 1994. Jin Kanno is in 1998, which is also unique across all rows.\n\nLooking at other years:\n\n2002: Mikaela Mar\u00eda Jaworski \u2013 unique.\n2006: Ali Yousuf Al-Rumaihi \u2013 unique.\n2010: Ramzy Al Duhami \u2013 unique.\n\nSo in all the years listed, each gold medalist is unique. There are no repetitions except possibly if I missed something.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check 1994 and 1998 because the claim says those two years should be exceptions where the medalist didn't change. But according to the table, both 1994 and 1998 have different gold medalists from each other and all other years.\n\nSo if there are no repeated gold medalists across any of the years in the table, that means every year had a different gold medalist. Therefore, the exception mentioned in the claim (1994 and 1998) doesn't hold because those two years also have unique winners.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because it states there were exceptions in 1994 and 1998 where the gold medalists didn't change, but according to the table, each year has a different winner without any repeats.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
