    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, the user has provided a table with various rows of data, each representing some event or match details, I suppose. The claim is about a specific score on a particular date in Super League XII.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim: \"the score on 15/04/07 in super league xii be 52-22.\" So, they're stating that on April 15th, 2007, in the competition known as Super League XII, the score was 52-22. My job is to verify if this claim is true or false based on the data provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent a different match with details like date, team names, scores, and other stats. The rows are indexed from 0 onwards. I need to find the row where the date matches 15/04/07 and see if the score there is indeed 52-22.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Date is 15/04/07, competition is Super League XII. The score is 52-22. That's exactly what the claim states. So this seems to support the claim.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows with the same date to ensure there isn't another entry that contradicts it. Scanning through the rest of the table, I don't see any other entries for 15/04/07. All other dates are different, so this must be the only relevant row.\n\nTherefore, since the claim matches exactly with the data in Row 1, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cell is that specific row's score.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Scanning the rows:\n\n- Row 3: Date is 15/04/07. That's a match.\n\nNow, checking the details for this row:\n- Competition is Super League XII, which matches.\n- The score was 52 to 22, which aligns with the claim.\n- Attendance listed here is 9000, as per the claim.\n\nSo all parts of the claim are accurate based on Row 3. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cell is in row 3 under 'attendance'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table with various rows and columns related to some scores in the Super League XII competition. They want me to verify a claim: \"the super league xii score on 21/07/07 be 14-10.\" My job is to check if this claim is true based on the data provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the user is asking for. The claim specifies that on July 21, 2007 (assuming the date format is DD/MM/YYYY), the score in the Super League XII was 14-10. To verify this, I'll look through the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different match with details like the date, home team, away team, score, goalscorer(s), attendance, and competition type (which should be Super League XII in this case). \n\nMy first step is to locate the row where the date is 21/07/07. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 3: Date is 21/09/07\n- Row 4: 28/07/07\n- Continuing down, I find Row 25: 21/07/07\n\nSo, row index 25 (assuming the first row after headers is index 3 as per initial data) has the date 21/07/07. Let me confirm that. \n\nWait, in the provided table, rows start from index 3 to 32, each representing a match with its details. So, for clarity, I'll check row by row:\n\n- Row 3: Date is 25/09/07\n- Row 4: 05/10/07\n...\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me recount the rows correctly.\n\nLooking at the user's data, rows are listed from what seems to be row index 3 onwards up to 32, each with a specific date. The claim is about 21/07/07, so I need to find the row where the date matches that.\n\nUpon reviewing, I see:\n\n- Row 24: Date 21/07/07\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. Looking at the data provided, each row is listed with a 'date' field. The rows are as follows (abridged for clarity):\n\nRow 3: date 25/09/07\nRow 4: 05/10/07\n...\nWait, perhaps I'm misaligning. Let me list the dates properly:\n\nLooking at each row's date:\n\n- Row 3: 28/07/07 (home team Salford City Reds vs Bradford)\nWait, no. Wait, actually, looking back, the rows are as follows:\n\nRow 3: date 28/07/07\nRow 4: 05/08/07\nRow 5: 12/08/07\nRow 6: 19/08/07\nRow 7: 02/09/07\nRow 8: 09/09/07\nRow 9: 14/09/07\nRow 10: 21/09/07\n\nWait, that can't be. Let me re-express the table correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the row indices. The user provided rows from index 3 to 32, but let's look at the actual data:\n\nLooking through each row description:\n\nRow 3: date is 21/07/07? Wait no:\n\nActually, looking back, the rows are as follows (abridged):\n\n- Row 3: \"date\": \"28/07/07\"\n- Row 4: \"05/08/07\"\n- ...\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go through each row's date:\n\nLooking at the data provided in the user's message, starting from row index 3:\n\nRow 3: date is 28/07/07\nRow 4: 05/08/07\nRow 5: 12/08/07\nRow 6: 19/08/07\nRow 7: 02/09/07\nRow 8: 09/09/07\nRow 9: 14/09/07\nRow 10: 21/9/07 (note the date format here is different, possibly September 21)\nWait, but the claim is about July 21.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a row. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the rows provided in the user's message:\n\n- The first few rows after index 3 are:\nRow 3: date \"28/07/07\"\nRow 4: \"05/08/07\"\nRow 5: \"12/08/07\"\nRow 6: \"19/08/07\"\nRow 7: \"02/09/07\"\nRow 8: \"09/09/07\"\nRow 9: \"14/09/07\"\nRow 10: \"21/09/07\"\n\nWait, so there is no row with date 21/07/07. The earliest July date is 28/07/07 (row 3). Then August and September dates follow.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the rows. Let me recount from the user's data:\n\nThe user provided rows starting at index 3 up to index 32. Each row has a 'date' field. The claim is about 21/07/07.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 3: date \"28/07/07\"\nRow 4: \"05/08/07\"\nRow 5: \"12/08/07\"\nRow 6: \"19/08/07\"\nRow 7: \"02/09/07\"\nRow 8: \"09/09/07\"\nRow 9: \"14/09/07\"\nRow 10: \"21/09/07\"\n\nSo, there's no row with date 21/07/07. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because such a match doesn't exist in the provided data.\n\nWait, but perhaps I missed it earlier. Let me check again:\n\nIn the user's table, the rows are as follows (abridged):\n\nRow 3: \"date\": \"28/07/07\"\nRow 4: \"05/08/07\"\n...\nNo row with \"21/07/07\" exists. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nSo, to answer the user's query, I'll need to state that the claim is incorrect because there's no entry for July 21, 2007 in the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"the super league xii score on 21/07/07 be 14-10\" is false based on the provided data. There is no row with the date 21/07/07.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Claim:** The user claims that on July 21, 2007 (assuming DD/MM/YYYY format), the Super League XII score was 14-10.\n\n2. **Review the Table:** Examine each row in the table to find a match with the date 21/07/07.\n\n3. **Scan Dates:**\n   - Row 3: 28/07/07\n   - Row 4: 05/08/07\n   - Row 5: 12/08/07\n   - Row 6: 19/08/07\n   - Row 7: 02/09/07\n   - Row 8: 09/09/07\n   - Row 9: 14/09/07\n   - Row 10: 21/09/07\n\n4. **Conclusion:** There is no row with the date 21/07/07. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified as true based on the provided data.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is false because there is no entry in the table for July 21, 2007 (21/07/07).",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I have a table with various rows and columns containing data about sports matches, specifically involving Bradford as either the home or away team. The claim is: \"the score on 21/07/07 be 14 to 10 and the home team be bradford.\" \n\nFirst, I need to verify if there's a row with the date '21/07/07'. Looking through the rows provided:\n\n- Row 25 has the date '28/07/07'.\n- Row 24 is '21/07/07' but wait, no, actually in the data provided, looking back:\n\nWait, I think I might have misread. Let me check each row again carefully.\n\nLooking at the rows from index 0 to 32 as given:\n\nRow 25: date '28/07/07', home team Salford City Reds, score 14-10, away team Bradford.\n\nWait, but that's not 21/07/07. Let me check row 25 again\u2014nope, it's 28 July.\n\nLooking for '21/07/07'... Hmm, I don't see a row with that exact date. The dates go from May to September 2007. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because there's no match on 21 July 2007 in this data.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all rows:\n\nRow 0: 05/07/07\nRow 1: 12/07/07\nRow 2: 19/07/07\nRow 3: 26/07/07\nWait, no\u2014actually looking at the rows:\n\nWait, in the data provided, the first row is Row 0 with date '05/07/07' (July 5), then Row 1 is '12/07/07', Row 2: '19/07/07', Row 3: '26/07/07', and so on.\n\nSo, row 24 has date '28/07/07' with home team Salford City Reds and away team Bradford. The score is 14-10.\n\nWait, but the claim says the date is 21/07/07, which isn't present in any of these rows. Therefore, there's no row where the date matches '21/07/07'. \n\nAdditionally, even if I consider that perhaps there's a typo and it's supposed to be another date, but based on the given data, 21 July isn't listed.\n\nSo, since the claim refers to a specific date not present in the table, the score and home team can't be verified. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
