    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's see what the user is asking for here. They've given me a table with 25 rows of fight results and a specific claim about two fights: one against Glover Teixeira and another against Jan Nortje. The claim states that the fight against Teixeira was a loss by KO via punches, while the fight against Nortje was a win via TKO also by punches.\n\nFirst, I need to check each part of this claim against the table provided. Let me go through the table step by step. \n\nLooking at the rows for Glover Teixeira: Scanning through, row 23 mentions Glover Teixeira as the opponent. The result was a loss (as per 'res: loss'), and the method is KO (punches). That matches exactly with what the claim states. So that's correct.\n\nNext, checking the fight against Jan Nortje: I need to find where Jan Nortje is listed as the opponent. Row 16 shows Jan Nortje as the opponent. The result there is a win ('res: win'), and the method is TKO via punches. That also aligns perfectly with the claim.\n\nSince both conditions in the claim are fully supported by the table, the answer should be TRUE. Also, I need to note the relevant cells for each part of the claim. For Teixeira, it's row 23 under opponent and method. For Nortje, it's row 16 under opponent and method.\n\nI think that covers everything the user asked for.

The user has provided a table with 25 rows, each representing a fight result with various details like opponent, method, and outcome. The claim is that both fights against opponents Shamil Abdurahimov and Houston Alexander resulted in losses with the method \"TKO (punches)\" for both.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim carefully. It states two specific points:\n1. Both opponents were fought.\n2. Both fights ended with a loss by TKO via punches.\n\nTo verify this, I'll go through each row of the table and look for entries where the opponent is either Shamil Abdurahimov or Houston Alexander. Once found, I'll check the 'res' (result) and 'method' columns to see if they match the claim.\n\nLooking at Row 17: Opponent is Renato Sobral, not relevant. Moving on.\nRow 18: Opponent is Luiz Can\u00e9. Not relevant.\nRow 19: Opponent is Kazuhiro Nakamura. Not relevant.\nRow 20: Opponent is Lyoto Machida.

Result is 'Loss', method is KO (punches). This doesn't match the claim's opponent or exact method.\n\nWait, did I skip a row? Let me double-check. The table goes up to Row 25. Maybe I missed something earlier.\n\nLooking back at Row 17: Opponent Renato Sobral, result 'Loss', method submission (D'Arce choke). Not relevant.\nRow 18: Luiz Can\u00e9, 'Loss' by TKO (punches). Opponent is Houston Alexander? Wait, no. Let me check the opponent names again.\n\nHold on, perhaps I misread Row 17 and 18. Let me check each row systematically.\n\nLooking at each row:\n- Rows 0 to 4: Not relevant.\nRow 5: Opponent Ricco Rodriguez? No.\nRow 6: Not relevant.\nRow 7: Opponent Renato Sobral, result 'Loss', method submission (D'Arce choke). So opponent is Renato Sobral, not the ones in the claim.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misnumbering. Let me recount from the top. The user provided rows up to row 25. Let's go through each relevant row:\n\nLooking for opponents Shamil Abdurahimov and Houston Alexander.\n\nRow 17: Opponent Renato Sobral, result 'Loss', method submission (D'Arce choke).\nRow 18: Opponent Luiz Can\u00e9, result 'Loss', method TKO (punches). Not the right opponent.\nRow 19: Opponent Kazuhiro Nakamura, result 'Win'.\nRow 20: Opponent Lyoto Machida, result 'Loss' via submission.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to check other rows. Wait, in Row 17 and 18, the opponents are Renato Sobral and Luiz Can\u00e9, respectively. Neither is Shamil Abdurahimov or Houston Alexander.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine all rows for these two specific opponents.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: Opponent Ricco Rodriguez? No.\nRow 1: Not relevant.\n...\nRow 17: Renato Sobral.\nRow 18: Luiz Can\u00e9.\nRow 19: Kazuhiro Nakamura.\nRow 20: Lyoto Machida.\nRow 21: Ricardo Arona.\nRow 22: Ant\u00f4nio Rog\u00e9rio Nogueira.\nRow 23: Glover Teixeira, result 'Loss', method KO (punches). Opponent is Glover Teixeira, so not relevant.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing the rows where these opponents appear. Let me check again carefully.\n\nLooking for \"Shamil Abdurahimov\" and \"Houston Alexander\" in the opponent column.\n\nUpon reviewing all 25 rows, I don't see any entries with these exact names as opponents. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because there are no fights against these two opponents resulting in losses by TKO (punches). \n\nWait, but in Row 17 and Row 18, the results were 'Loss' via methods that include punches, but the opponents don't match the claim.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be Rows 17 and 18 where the result was a loss via method involving punches, but since the opponents aren't Shamil Abdurahimov or Houston Alexander, the claim isn't supported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim mentions two fights:\n\n1. A fight against Gary Padilla in San Diego, California.\n2. A fight against Paul Weremecki in Portland, Oregon.\n\nI need to check each of these points against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table rows one by one:\n\n- For Gary Padilla: I'll scan through the opponents until I find his name.

That matches the claim.\n\nNext, checking for Paul Weremecki: I go through each row again. Row 24 shows the opponent as Paul Weremecki, and the location is Portland, Oregon, United States. This also aligns with what's stated in the claim.\n\nBoth pieces of information are correctly represented in their respective rows.

Scanning rows 1 to 25... Row 24 has \"opponent\": paul weremecki. In that row, the result is \"res\": win. So according to this, the fighter won against Paul Weremecki with method tko (head kick and punches). But the claim says the fighter lost both matches. That's a contradiction.\n\n- Next, Gary Padilla: Scanning for \"gary padilla\" in opponent column. Found in row 25. The result is \"res\": win again, with method decision (split).

The claim states that \"the fighter have match in country outside of the united state include saitama , japan , birmingham , england , and brisbane , australia.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It mentions several locations outside the United States where the fighter has had matches: Saitama (Japan), Birmingham (England), and Brisbane (Australia). So I need to check if each of these locations appears in the table as a location outside the US.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like opponent, method, round, time, and location. The \"location\" column will be key here. I'll go through each relevant cell to see where matches took place.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\nRow 21: Opponent Ricardo Arona, Location Saitama, Japan. That's outside the US. So that's one of the locations mentioned in the claim.\n\nRow 18: Opponent Luiz Can\u00e9, Location Birmingham, England. Birmingham is indeed a city in the UK, so this counts as another location outside the US.\n\nRow 25 doesn't seem relevant because it's in San Diego, California, which is within the US.\n\nLooking further down:\n\nRow 16: Location Yokohama, Japan. That's another place in Japan, but not Saitama specifically. The claim mentions Saitama, so this isn't directly matching but indicates multiple matches in Japan.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed something. Let me check each row for the specific locations mentioned.\n\nRow 21: Saitama, Japan \u2013 yes.\nRow 18: Birmingham, England \u2013 yes.\nIs there a match in Brisbane, Australia? Scanning through all rows:\n\nLooking at Row 9: Location yokohama, japan (again). No Brisbane here. Let me check other rows.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it earlier.

The claim mentions Brisbane as one of the locations outside the US where matches took place. But according to the table provided, all the international locations are Saitama (Japan), Birmingham (England), and Yokohama (Japan). There's no mention of Brisbane, Australia.\n\nSo, even though there are matches in other countries like Japan and England, the specific location of Brisbane isn't present. Therefore, the claim includes Brisbane as a match location outside the US, but it doesn't exist in the table. Hence, the claim is not fully supported because one of the locations mentioned (Brisbane) isn't listed.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions specific locations outside the US, including Saitama, Japan; Birmingham, England; and Brisbane, Australia.

The claim states that in both of these fights, the result was a win with the method being \"TKO (punches).\"\n\nNow, I'll go through each row of the table to find matches for these opponents.\n\nStarting with Shamil Abdurahimov. Looking through the rows:\n\nRow 17: Opponent is Renato Sobral... not him.\nRow 18: Luiz Can\u00e9... nope.\nRow 19: Kazuhiro Nakamura... no.\nRow 20: Lyoto Machida... no.\nRow 21: Ricardo Arona... no.\nWait, I think I might have missed something. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at Row 17: Opponent is Renato Sobral \u2013 not Shamil.\nRow 18: Luiz Can\u00e9 \u2013 nope.\nRow 19: Kazuhiro Nakamura \u2013 nope.\nWait, maybe I skipped some rows earlier. Let's go back to the top.\n\nWait, actually, in Row 23: Opponent is Glover Teixeira... no.\nWait, perhaps I need to look further down or up?\n\nHold on, looking at Row 17 again: Opponent Renato Sobral \u2013 nope.\nRow 18: Luiz Can\u00e9... nope.\nHmm. Maybe I'm not finding Shamil because he's in a different place.\n\nWait, let me go through each row systematically:\n\nLooking for \"Shamil Abdurahimov\" as the opponent.\n\nRow 25: Opponent Gary Padilla \u2013 nope.\nRow 24: Paul Weremecki... nope.\nRow 23: Glover Teixeira... no.\nRow 22: Ant\u00f4nio Rog\u00e9rio Nogueira... no.\nRow 21: Ricardo Arona... no.\nRow 20: Lyoto Machida... no.\nRow 19: Kazuhiro Nakamura... no.\nRow 18: Luiz Can\u00e9... nope.\nRow 17: Renato Sobral... no.\nRow 16: Jan Nortje... nope.\nRow 15: Bob Sapp \u2013 no, wait. Wait, Row 15 is the fight against Bob Sapp where the result was a win via TKO (punches). So that's one of the wins mentioned in the claim.\n\nBut the opponent for that row is Bob Sapp, not Shamil or Houston.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me look again.\n\nLooking at Row 17: Opponent Renato Sobral \u2013 result was loss.\nRow 18: Opponent Luiz Can\u00e9 \u2013 loss, method Tko (punches).\nRow 19: Opponent Kazuhiro Nakamura \u2013 win via TKO (leg injury). So not punches here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check all rows where opponent is either Shamil Abdurahimov or Houston Alexander.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Opponent not listed as required.\n...\nWait, maybe I need to look more carefully. Wait, Row 17 has opponent Renato Sobral \u2013 nope. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the table doesn't have Shamil Abdurahimov or Houston Alexander at all? Let me check each row's opponent:\n\nRow 0: Opponent not listed as per data.\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 25: Gary Padilla\n- Row 24: Paul Weremecki\n- Row 23: Glover Teixeira\n- Row 22: Ant\u00f4nio Rog\u00e9rio Nogueira\n- Row 21: Ricardo Arona\n- Row 20: Lyoto Machida\n- Row 19: Kazuhiro Nakamura\n- Row 18: Luiz Can\u00e9\n- Row 17: Renato Sobral\n- Row 16: Jan Nortje\n- Row 15: Bob Sapp\n- Row 14: Not provided in the data, but based on count, seems up to row 25.\n\nWait a second, I don't see any rows where the opponent is Shamil Abdurahimov or Houston Alexander. So both opponents mentioned in the claim aren't present in the table. Therefore, there's no way for both fights against them to have resulted in wins via TKO (punches).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the rows. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at Row 17: Opponent is Renato Sobral \u2013 result was loss via submission.\nRow 18: Luiz Can\u00e9 \u2013 loss via Tko (punches).\nWait, no mention of Shamil or Houston here.\n\nSo based on this, it seems the table does not include any fights against Shamil Abdurahimov or Houston Alexander. Therefore, the claim that both fights resulted in wins via TKO (punches) is incorrect because those opponents aren't even listed in the data provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no; there are no such entries for these opponents in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not contain any matches against Shamil Abdurahimov or Houston Alexander. Therefore, it's impossible for both fights to have resulted in wins via TKO (punches) as claimed.\n\n**Answer:** No, the table does not include fights against either Shamil Abdurahimov or Houston Alexander, so the claim cannot be verified based on this data.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the fighter have match in country inside of the united state include saitama , japan , birmingham , england , and brisbane , australia\". So, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should identify which countries are listed in the locations where matches took place. The claim mentions several locations: Saitama (Japan), Birmingham (England), Brisbane (Australia), and also mentions \"inside of the United State\". Wait, that part is a bit confusing because it says \"include\" followed by specific places outside the U.S., but also refers to being inside the U.S. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a 'location' column. I'll go through each row and note where the matches took place.\n\n- Row 0: yokohama, japan\n- Row 1: yokohama, japan\n- Row 2: anaheim, california, united states\n- Row 3: birmingham, england\n- Row 4: las vegas, nevada, united states\n- Row 5: saitama, japan\n- Row 6: las vegas, nevada, united states\n- Row 7: pride 34 in saitama, japan\n- Row 8: pride 33 in las vegas, nevada, united states\n- Row 9: lemoore, california, united states\n- Row 10: portland, oregon, united states\n- Row 11: san diego, california, united states\n\nWait, I see multiple locations within the United States like California, Nevada, Oregon. The claim mentions that the fighter had matches inside the U.S., which is true because there are several rows where the location is in the U.S.\n\nAdditionally, the claim lists specific countries outside the U.S.: Saitama (Japan), Birmingham (England), and Brisbane (Australia). Let me check if these locations appear in the table:\n\n- Saitama appears in Row 5 and Row 7.\n- Birmingham is in Row 3.\n- Brisbane isn't mentioned anywhere in the table. Looking through all rows, I don't see any location named Brisbane.\n\nSo the fighter did have matches in Japan (Saitama), England (Birmingham), and within the United States. However, there's no match listed in Brisbane, Australia. Therefore, the claim includes a location that isn't present in the data provided. This means the claim is not fully supported because Brisbane isn't a match location in the table.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE because one of the specified locations (Brisbane) doesn't exist in the given data.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_7\", \"location\": \"saitama, japan\"},\n     {\"row_3\", \"location\": \"birmingham, england\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nWait, the correct JSON should list row indices and column names properly. Here's the accurate version:\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nBut since Brisbane isn't present, and other locations are correct except for it not being in the data.",
