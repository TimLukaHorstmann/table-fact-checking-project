It seems like it's stating that in the year 830 BC, there was a sovereign from the Song state. So I'm looking for any row where 'state' is 'song' and 'from' is 830 BC.\n\nLooking at the table rows one by one:\n\nRow 16: State is song, type is sovereign, name is hui, title is duke, royal house is -, from: 830 bc. That matches exactly with the claim. The state is Song and the year is 830 BC. So this row supports the claim.\n\nI don't need to check other rows because I already found a match. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"state\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"from\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"xi or xian be the name when the state be jin\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that either \"xi\" or \"xian\" are names associated with the state \"jin\". So, I should look through the table for entries where the state is \"jin\" and see if their names are either \"xi\" or \"xian\".\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are 19 rows. Let me go through each row to find any that have the state as \"jin\".\n\nRow 8: State is \"jin\", name is \"xi\". So this fits because the name is \"xi\" and the state is \"jin\".\nRow 9: State is \"jin\", name is \"xian\". This also fits because the name here is \"xian\" under state \"jin\".\n\nSo both rows 8 and 9 have the state as \"jin\" with names that match either \"xi\" or \"xian\". Therefore, the claim seems to be supported by these two entries.\n\nI don't see any other rows where the state is \"jin\", so I think those are the only relevant ones. Since both names mentioned in the claim appear under the state \"jin\", the claim should be true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that either \"xi\" or \"xian\" are names when the state is \"jin\". Checking the table, rows 8 and 9 have the state \"jin\" with names \"xi\" and \"xian\" respectively. Thus, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"state\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"state\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that in cases where the royal house is \"ji\" and the state is \"cai,\" the name should be \"yi.\" So, I'm looking for any rows in the table where both the royal house is \"ji\" and the state is \"cai.\" If such a row exists and the name there is indeed \"yi,\" then the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nNow, let me go through each row of the table one by one to check these conditions.\n\nRow 1: State is cai, royal house is ji. Name is yi. This matches exactly what the claim is saying. So this row supports the claim.\n\nRow 2: State is cao, not cai, so I can ignore this for this specific condition.\n\nRow 3: Again, state is cao, so not relevant here.\n\nRows 4 to 19: Looking through each of these rows, only Row 1 has both \"state\" as cai and \"royal house\" as ji. The other rows either have a different state or a different royal house. For example, Rows 8-9 have the state jin with royal house ji, but that's not cai. Similarly, Rows 10-13 are about states lu, qi, etc., which don't meet both conditions.\n\nSo, only Row 1 meets both criteria of state being cai and royal house being ji. In this row, the name is yi, which aligns perfectly with the claim.\n\nTherefore, since the claim is fully supported by Row 1, I should mark it as TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that when the royal house is \"ji\" and the state is \"cai,\" the name is \"yi.\" Checking the table:\n\n- **Row 1** has:\n  - State: cai\n  - Royal House: ji\n  - Name: yi\n\nThis matches all conditions, confirming the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"state\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. The claim is stating that either \"xi\" or \"xian\" are names under two conditions: the state must be \"jin\" and the title must be \"duke\".\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to check if any meet these criteria. \n\nStarting with Row 8: State is Jin, type is Sovereign, name is Xi, title is Marquis, royal house is Ji, from year 840 BC.\n- So here, the state is Jin, but the title is Marquis, not Duke. Therefore, this doesn't satisfy the claim's condition about the title.\n\nNext, Row 9: State is Jin, type is Sovereign, name is Xian, title is Marquis, royal house is Ji, from year 822 BC.\n- Again, state is Jin, but the title is Marquis. So this doesn't meet the title requirement either.\n\nI should check all rows to ensure there are no other instances where state is Jin and title is Duke. Scanning through Rows 10 to 19, none of them have both state as Jin and title as Duke.\n\nTherefore, neither Xi nor Xian in the table under state Jin has a title of Duke. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks for entries where the state is Jin and the title is Duke with names Xi or Xian.

The claim is: \"yi be the name when the royal house be ji and the state be cai and the year be 826.\" I'll need to verify each part of this claim against the provided table.\n\nFirst, I should parse the claim into its components:\n1. Name: yi\n2. Royal House: ji\n3. State: cai\n4. Year: 826\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row has information about different states and their sovereigns. Let's go through each relevant part.\n\nThe first thing is to check if there's a person named \"yi\" in the table. Scanning through the names, I see in Row 1 that the name is \"yi.\" That matches the claim.\n\nNext, checking the royal house for this entry: It's listed as \"ji,\" which also matches the claim. So far, so good.\n\nNow, looking at the state: The row says \"cai,\" which aligns with the state mentioned in the claim. That's another point in favor of the claim being true.\n\nFinally, checking the year: Row 1 has \"from: 837 bc.\" But the claim specifies the year as 826. This is a discrepancy because 837 doesn't match 826. \n\nWait, are there any other rows that might fit? Let's check if there's another entry for state cai or with royal house ji around 826. Looking through the table:\n\n- Row 1: state cai, year 837 bc\n- Other states have their own years and houses.\n\nI don't see any other entries where state is cai, name is yi, royal house is ji, except for row 1, which doesn't match the year. Therefore, there's no entry that satisfies all four conditions of the claim: name \"yi,\" royal house \"ji,\" state \"cai,\" and year \"826.\"\n\nSo, even though three out of four parts are correct in Row 1, the year is different.
