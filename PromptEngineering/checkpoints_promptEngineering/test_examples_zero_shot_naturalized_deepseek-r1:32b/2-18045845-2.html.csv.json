    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a table with multiple rows and columns containing data about various competitions. The claim is: \"on 23 january 2010 d be the result of the friendly competition.\" My task is to verify if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided data.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim states that on January 23, 2010, there was a result 'D' in a friendly competition. So, I'm looking for a row in the table where the date is 23 Jan 2010 and the result was 'D' with the competition type being friendly.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row to find the one with the date \"23 january 2010.\" Going through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: Date is 2009-11-25, which is November 25, 2009. Not matching.\n- Row 1: Date is 2010-01-23, which translates to January 23, 2010. This matches the date in the claim.\n\nNow that I've found the relevant row (Row 1), I need to check two things:\n1. What was the result of this competition?\n2. Was it a friendly competition?\n\nLooking at Row 1's details:\n- Result is 'D'. In sports, 'D' often stands for a draw or tied game.\n- The competition type is \"friendly\".\n\nSo both conditions are satisfied: the date matches, the result is 'D', and it was a friendly competition. \n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in Row 1 of the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly references that on January 23, 2010, there was a friendly competition with a result of 'D'. This matches Row 1's data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Competition\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to verify the claim that both competitions on 23 January 2010 and 22 August 2012 had a result of \"d\". Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, looking for the date 23 January 2010. Scanning through the rows, I find row 2 with the date matching exactly. The 'result' column here shows \"both d\", which aligns with the claim.\n\nNext, checking the date 22 August 2012. Looking at the table, row 26 has this exact date. However, the result in that row is listed as \"l\", not \"d\". This contradicts the claim because it's supposed to be \"d\" for both dates.\n\nSince one of the specified results doesn't match (it's \"l\" instead of \"d\"), the overall claim isn't fully supported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table data. The claim states: \"on 3 march 2010 the venue of the match be damascus , syria with a result w\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim and understand what it's asserting. It mentions three things:\n1. The date is March 3, 2010.\n2. The venue was in Damascus, Syria.\n3. The result was a win (denoted by 'w').\n\nI'll start by looking through each row of the table to find any entries that match these criteria.\n\nLooking at the rows, I see Row 5 has the date \"3 march 2010\". Let me check the details in this row:\n- Date: 3 March 2010\n- Venue: Damascus, Syria\n- Result: w (which stands for win)\n\nSo all three conditions from the claim are satisfied in this single row. There's no need to look further because this row matches exactly what the claim is stating.\n\nI should also ensure that there aren't any other rows with the same date but different venues or results, just to be thorough. Scanning through the rest of the table quickly, I don't see another entry for March 3, 2010. So Row 5 is the only relevant one here.\n\nTherefore, since the claim matches all the specified details in Row 5, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly identifies that on March 3, 2010, there was a match in Damascus, Syria with a result of 'w' (win). This is fully supported by Row 5.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
