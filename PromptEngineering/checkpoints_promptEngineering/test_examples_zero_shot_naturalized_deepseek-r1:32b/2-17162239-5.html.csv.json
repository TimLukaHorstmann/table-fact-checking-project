    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out whether the claim \"there be 6 player who be tie for sixth place\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided. It has rows with information about each player, including their place, name, country, score, and to par. The claim mentions that there are six players tied for sixth place, so I need to check how many players have \"place\" as t6.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 1: Place 1\n- Row 2: Place 2\n- Row 3: Place 3\n- Row 4 and 5: Both are t4 (tied for fourth)\n- Rows 6 to 11: Each of these rows has \"place\" as t6.\n\nLet's count how many players have place t6. From the table, rows 6 to 11 all list t6. That's six rows in total:\n\nRow 6: John Adams\nRow 7: Fred Funk\nRow 8: Wayne Levi\nRow 9: Craig Parry\nRow 10: Mike Standly\nRow 11: Tom Watson\n\nSo, each of these six players is tied for sixth place. The claim states exactly that there are six players in a tie for sixth place, which matches what I see in the table.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells to verify this claim would be the \"place\" column for each of these rows (6 through 11). Each row's \"place\" is t6, confirming the tie. \n\nNo other rows have a place listed as t6, so there are no additional players beyond these six in that position.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that six players are tied for sixth place, each marked as 't6' under the place column.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:** The claim refers to \"six players tied for sixth place.\" So, we need to check how many players have a \"place\" value of t6.\n2. **Examine Each Row:** From row 6 to row 11, each player's place is listed as t6.\n3. **Count the Players:** There are six such entries (rows 6-11), confirming that six players are indeed tied for sixth place.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is \"there be more player from the united state than from anywhere else.\" Hmm, okay, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many players are from the United States versus other countries. Looking at the table, each row has a 'country' column that tells us where each player is from. The rest of the columns like 'place', 'player', 'score', and 'to par' aren't directly relevant for this claim, so I can focus on just the country information.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Lee Janzen - United States\nRow 2: Payne Stewart - United States\nRow 3: Nick Price - Zimbabwe\nRow 4: Paul Azinger - United States\nRow 5: David Edwards - United States\nRow 6: John Adams - United States\nRow 7: Fred Funk - United States\nRow 8: Wayne Levi - United States\nRow 9: Craig Parry - Australia\nRow 10: Mike Standly - United States\nRow 11: Tom Watson - United States\n\nOkay, so counting the players from the US: rows 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,10,11.

So that's two players from outside the US.\n\nWait a minute, so there are only two players not from the US in this table. The rest, nine of them, are from the United States.
