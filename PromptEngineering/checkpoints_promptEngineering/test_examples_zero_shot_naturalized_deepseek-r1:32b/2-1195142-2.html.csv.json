    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the 2005 drama desk award for outstanding choreography do not go to william ivey long\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and then cross-referencing it with the data in the table.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions the year 2005, which helps narrow down the rows I need to look at. The award in question is the \"drama desk award,\" so I should focus on rows where the 'award' column says \"drama desk award.\" \n\nLooking at the table, rows 5, 6, and 7 are about the Drama Desk Awards. Now, within those rows, the category is specified as \"outstanding choreography\" in row 6. The claim is talking about whether William Ivey Long received this specific award.\n\nSo, I should check who was nominated for \"outstanding choreography\" under the Drama Desk Award in 2005. According to row 6, the nominee is Jerry Mitchell and the result is \"won.\" This means Jerry Mitchell won that award, not William Ivey Long.\n\nAdditionally, looking at row 7, William Ivey Long was nominated for \"outstanding costume design\" under the Drama Desk Award but did not win; he was only nominated. So, there's no mention of him being associated with the choreography category in any winning or losing capacity.\n\nTherefore, since the claim states that the award for outstanding choreography did not go to William Ivey Long, and based on the table data where Jerry Mitchell won it instead, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are row 6 where the category is \"outstanding choreography\" with nominee Jerry Mitchell who won, confirming William Ivey Long didn't receive this award.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"nominee for best costume design in 2005 at the tony award be qilliam ivey long\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It says that William Ivey Long was a nominee for Best Costume Design in 2005 at the Tony Award. So, I'm looking for entries in the table where the award is a Tony Award, the category is Best Costume Design, and the year is 2005. The nominee should be William Ivey Long.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple rows. Let's go through each relevant row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Year 2005, Tony Award, Best Revival of a Musical, nominee is the same as the category (which seems a bit odd, but maybe that's how it's listed), and the result was won. This doesn't match because the category here isn't Costume Design, so I can skip this.\n\nRow 2: Again, 2005 Tony Award, Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical, nominee is Gary Beach, result was nominated. Not relevant to Costume Design, so move on.\n\nRow 3: Year 2005, Tony Award for Best Choreography, nominee Jerry Mitchell, won. Still not the category we're looking for.\n\nRow 4: Here's where it gets interesting. It's the year 2005, Tony Award, Best Costume Design, nominee is William Ivey Long, and the result was nominated. This matches all parts of our claim except for a minor typo in the name \"qilliam ivey long\" vs \"William Ivey Long.\" But I think that's just a typo in the claim, so it doesn't affect the truthfulness.\n\nRows 5-7 are about Drama Desk Awards, which aren't relevant since the claim specifies Tony Award. So those can be ignored.\n\nPutting it all together: The table shows that William Ivey Long was indeed nominated for Best Costume Design at the 2005 Tony Awards. Therefore, despite a minor typo in the name, the claim is accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly identifies William Ivey Long as a nominee for Best Costume Design at the 2005 Tony Awards based on Row 4 of the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"jerry mitchell be 1 of 2 winner of a tony award\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It says that Jerry Mitchell was one of two winners of a Tony Award in 2005. So I need to check if there are exactly two Tony Awards won by nominees in 2005 and if Jerry Mitchell is one of them.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: This row mentions \"best revival of a musical\" with the result as \"won\". The nominee here is listed as \"best revival of a musical\", which seems like it's not an individual but rather the category itself. So this isn't a person winning, so I can ignore this for individual winners.\n\nRow 2: Gary Beach was nominated in another category but didn't win.\n\nRow 3: Jerry Mitchell won the Tony Award for best choreography. This counts as one winner.\n\nRows 4 and 5-7 are Drama Desk Awards, not Tony Awards, so they don't count towards the claim about Tony Awards.\n\nSo looking at all the rows related to Tony Awards (rows 1-4), only Row 3 shows a win by Jerry Mitchell. Are there any other Tony wins? Let's check again.\n\nRow 1: Not an individual winner.\nRow 2: Nominated, didn't win.\nRow 3: Won by Jerry Mitchell.\nRow 4: Nominated, didn't win.\n\nSo only one Tony Award was won in 2005 as per the table. Therefore, the claim that Jerry Mitchell is one of two winners isn't supported because there's only one winner listed here.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check all rows for any other Tony wins.\n\nRow 1: Result is 'won' but nominee is the category name, not a person.\nRow 3: Only Jerry Mitchell won a Tony. \n\nSo yes, only one winner of a Tony Award in this table is Jerry Mitchell. The claim says he's one of two, which would require another winner, but there isn't any other individual winner listed for Tony Awards in 2005 here.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Jerry Mitchell was one of two winners of a Tony Award in 2005. Upon reviewing the table, only one Tony Award win is recorded for Jerry Mitchell (Row 3), with no other individual winning a Tony in this data set. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"Jerry Mitchell be 1 of 3 nominee for a drama desk award\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table to understand its structure and content. The table has multiple rows with columns: year, award, category, nominee, result. Each row represents an award nomination or win from 2005.\n\nLooking at the claim, it states that Jerry Mitchell was one of three nominees for a Drama Desk Award. So I need to check two things: how many Drama Desk Award nominations there were in total and whether Jerry Mitchell was among them.\n\nI'll start by identifying all rows where the award is \"drama desk award.\" From the table:\n\n- Row 5: Drama Desk Award, category: outstanding revival of a musical, nominee: outstanding revival of a musical (result: won)\n- Row 6: Drama Desk Award, category: outstanding choreography, nominee: jerry mitchell (result: won)\n- Row 7: Drama Desk Award, category: outstanding costume design, nominee: william ivey long (result: nominated)\n\nSo there are three entries for the Drama Desk Awards. Now, looking at each of these:\n\n1. Row 5: The category is \"outstanding revival of a musical,\" and the nominee is listed as \"outstanding revival of a musical.\" This might be a bit confusing because the nominee name matches the category title, which could mean it's an organizational nomination rather than an individual person. So this doesn't count Jerry Mitchell.\n\n2. Row 6: The category is \"outstanding choreography,\" and the nominee is Jerry Mitchell, who won. So this counts as one of his nominations.\n\n3. Row 7: The category is \"outstanding costume design,\" and the nominee is William Ivey Long, who was nominated but didn't win. This doesn't involve Jerry Mitchell.\n\nWait a minute, so only one nomination for Jerry Mitchell in the Drama Desk Awards (Row 6). However, the claim says he was one of three nominees. That seems off because there are three Drama Desk Award entries in total, but only two of them have individual nominees: Row 5 (which might be organizational) and Rows 6 and 7 (individuals). So that's actually two individual nominees: Jerry Mitchell and William Ivey Long. \n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me double-check:\n\nRow 5's nominee is \"outstanding revival of a musical,\" which likely refers to the production or team rather than an individual person. Therefore, only Rows 6 and 7 have individual nominees for Drama Desk Awards: Jerry Mitchell (Row 6) and William Ivey Long (Row 7). So that makes two individual nominees, not three.\n\nBut the claim says Jerry was one of three nominees. So according to the table, there are only two individual nominees for Drama Desk Awards, meaning the claim is incorrect because it suggests there were three nominees, but in reality, there were only two individuals nominated (plus possibly an organizational nomination which doesn't count as a person). Therefore, the claim would be FALSE.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at all Drama Desk Award rows:\n\n- Row 5: Nominee is \"outstanding revival of a musical.\" This might represent a production team or company rather than an individual, so perhaps it's not counted as a personal nomination.\n- Row 6: Jerry Mitchell - individual nominee\n- Row 7: William Ivey Long - individual nominee\n\nSo that's two individual nominees. If the claim is about three nominees in total (including organizational), then technically there are three entries but only two individuals. The wording of the claim says \"nominee for a drama desk award\" without specifying if it's individual or organizational. However, typically, when talking about nominees, people refer to individuals unless specified otherwise.\n\nTherefore, if we count all nominees regardless of being individual or organizational, Row 5 is another nominee (though not an individual). So that would be three nominees in total for Drama Desk Awards: \"outstanding revival of a musical,\" Jerry Mitchell, and William Ivey Long. \n\nBut the claim says Jerry was one of three nominees, which would mean there are three individuals nominated. However, from the table, only two individuals were nominated (Jerry and William). The third nomination is an organizational or production category, not a person.\n\nSo depending on how we interpret \"nominee,\" if it's counting all nominees regardless of type, then Jerry was one out of three. But if it's about individual persons, he was one out of two.\n\nThe claim says \"1 of 3 nominee for a drama desk award.\" Given that, perhaps the total number of Drama Desk Award entries is three, so Jerry is indeed one of them. Therefore, the claim would be TRUE because there are three Drama Desk Award nominees in the table, and Jerry Mitchell is one of them.\n\nWait, but looking back, the \"nominee\" column in Row 5 says \"outstanding revival of a musical,\" which might not be an individual person. So perhaps it's better to consider only Rows 6 and 7 as individual nominees, making two in total. Therefore, Jerry Mitchell was one of two, not three, meaning the claim is FALSE.\n\nI think I need to clarify: when the claim says \"nominee for a drama desk award,\" does it include all categories or just individuals? If all, then there are three nominees (including the organizational one), making Jerry one of three. But if only individual nominees, then two. \n\nThe table's structure might help: in Row 5, the nominee is listed as \"outstanding revival of a musical,\" which seems like it could be an award given to a production or team rather than a person. Therefore, perhaps that's not counted as an individual nomination.\n\nIn that case, Jerry Mitchell is one of two individual nominees for Drama Desk Awards in this table (Rows 6 and 7). So the claim that he was one of three would be FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, if we count all entries as nominees regardless of being individuals or organizations, then there are three: Row5's nominee, Row6's Jerry Mitchell, and Row7's William Ivey Long. Therefore, Jerry is one of three nominees, making the claim TRUE.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. However, in award contexts, when they mention nominees, they often refer to individual people unless it's specifically an organizational or production category.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the claim is FALSE because only two individuals were nominated for Drama Desk Awards: Jerry and William. Therefore, Jerry was one of two, not three.\n\nWait, but the table shows three Drama Desk Award entries:\n\n- Row5: outstanding revival (possibly a team/production)\n- Row6: Jerry Mitchell\n- Row7: William Ivey Long\n\nSo if we count all as nominees regardless of individual or organizational, then there are three nominees. Therefore, the claim that Jerry was one of three would be TRUE.\n\nBut I'm not sure if \"nominee\" in this context includes both individuals and organizations. Typically, when people say \"nominee,\" they mean an individual person. So perhaps the correct count is two individuals (Jerry and William), making the claim FALSE because it says 3.\n\nThis is a bit tricky, but based on standard usage, I think nominees are individuals unless specified otherwise. Therefore, since only two individuals were nominated for Drama Desk Awards in this data set, Jerry was one of two, not three. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Jerry Mitchell was one of three nominees for a Drama Desk Award is based on interpreting \"nominee\" as including both individual and organizational categories. However, typically, \"nominee\" refers to individuals. In this case, only two individuals (Jerry and William) were nominated, making the claim incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE",

The user has provided a table in naturalized format and a specific claim they want me to evaluate as either TRUE or FALSE based on the table. I need to carefully analyze each part of the claim against the table entries.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the table to understand its structure. There are seven rows, all from the year 2005. Each row has details about different awards, categories, nominees, and results. The awards mentioned are Tony Award and Drama Desk Award. For each award, there's a category, a nominee, and whether they won or were nominated.\n\nThe claim to evaluate is: \"William Ivey Long win the 2005 drama desk award for outstanding choreography.\" Let me break this down into its components:\n\n1. **Name of the person**: William Ivey Long\n2. **Year**: 2005\n3. **Award Type**: Drama Desk Award\n4. **Category**: Outstanding Choreography\n5. **Result**: Won\n\nNow, I'll go through each row in the table to see if there's a match for these criteria.\n\n- **Row 1**: Tony Award, Best Revival of a Musical, Nominee: Best Revival... Result: Won. Doesn't involve William Ivey Long or Choreography.\n- **Row 2**: Tony Award, Leading Actor in a Musical, Gary Beach. Not relevant here.\n- **Row 3**: Tony Award, Best Choreography, Jerry Mitchell. Result: Won. This is about Choreography but under the Tony Awards, and it's a different person.\n- **Row 4**: Tony Award, Costume Design, William Ivey Long, Result: Nominated. So he was nominated here but didn't win for this category in Tony Awards.\n- **Row 5**: Drama Desk, Outstanding Revival of a Musical. Not about William or Choreography.\n- **Row 6**: Drama Desk, Outstanding Choreography, Jerry Mitchell, Result: Won. Again, it's the same person as Row 3 but under Drama Desk. So William Ivey Long isn't involved here.\n- **Row 7**: Drama Desk, Outstanding Costume Design, William Ivey Long, Result: Nominated. Here, he was nominated in this category for Drama Desk.\n\nFrom this analysis, I see that William Ivey Long was involved in two categories under the Drama Desk Award but both times it's for Costume Design, and both resulted in nominations, not wins. The Outstanding Choreography award at Drama Desk went to Jerry Mitchell, who also won the same category at Tony Awards.\n\nThe claim states that William Ivey Long won the 2005 Drama Desk Award for outstanding choreography. However, according to the table:\n\n- There's no entry where William Ivey Long is the nominee under Outstanding Choreography.\n- The winner of Outstanding Choreography was Jerry Mitchell.\n- William was nominated but didn't win in Costume Design categories.\n\nTherefore, all the relevant cells show that the claim doesn't hold true. He wasn't even a nominee for Outstanding Choreography; instead, it was Jerry Mitchell who won that award.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"gary beach be 1 of 4 nominee for a tony award\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions Gary Beach being one of four nominees for a Tony Award. So I need to check if Gary Beach was nominated in 2005 and how many total nominations there were for that award category in that year.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an award entry from 2005. The relevant columns are 'award', 'category', 'nominee', and 'result'. \n\nRow 1: Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical, nominee is \"best revival of a musical\" which seems to be a category name rather than a person. Result is 'won'.\nRow 2: Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical, nominee is Gary Beach, result is 'nominated'.\nRows 3-7 include other categories and awards, but the claim is about the Tony Awards, so I'll focus on rows 1-4.\n\nSo, from row 2, we know Gary Beach was nominated for a Tony Award. Now, to find out if he was one of four nominees, we need to count how many people were nominated in that category.\n\nWait, actually, each row represents an individual nomination. So looking at the 'award' column, only rows where award is 'tony award' are relevant. Let's list those:\n\nRow 1: Tony, Best Revival, \"best revival\", won.\nRow 2: Tony, Leading Actor, Gary Beach, nominated.\nRow 3: Tony, Choreography, Jerry Mitchell, won.\nRow 4: Tony, Costume Design, William Ivey Long, nominated.\n\nSo in the Tony Awards category for 2005, there are four entries. Each entry represents a different category or result. But wait, the 'nominee' column in row 1 is \"best revival of a musical\", which seems like it's actually the award category itself, not an individual nominee. That might be confusing because usually, a nomination would list a person.\n\nSo for the Tony Awards in 2005:\n- Best Revival: \"best revival of a musical\" as the nominee (probably representing multiple nominees but listed as one entry).\n- Leading Actor: Gary Beach.\n- Choreography: Jerry Mitchell.\n- Costume Design: William Ivey Long.\n\nBut each of these is an individual award category, so each row represents a separate nomination. Therefore, in total, there are four Tony Award nominations listed here. However, the claim says \"1 of 4 nominees for a tony award.\" So Gary Beach was one of these four nominees across different categories.\n\nWait, but the way the table is structured might mean that each row is an individual nomination. For example, row 2 is Gary Beach's nomination in Leading Actor. The others are separate categories but still Tony Award nominations. So if we count all the 'nominated' or 'won' results under the Tony Award, how many have a person as the nominee?\n\nRow 1: \"best revival of a musical\" - not a person.\nRow 2: Gary Beach - person, nominated.\nRow 3: Jerry Mitchell - won.\nRow 4: William Ivey Long - nominated.\n\nSo in terms of individual people being nominees for Tony Awards in 2005 as per this table:\n- Gary Beach (nominated)\n- Jerry Mitchell (won)\n- William Ivey Long (nominated)\n\nThat's three people. But the claim says he was one of four. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"best revival\" category had multiple nominees, but it's listed as a single entry in row 1. Maybe that category had several nominees, each being a different musical or production. So if the best revival category alone had four nominees, then Gary Beach could be one of four. But looking at the table, the nominee is \"best revival of a musical\", which seems like it's referring to the category itself rather than individual nominees.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to the number of nominations Gary Beach received across different categories, but that doesn't make sense because he was only nominated once here.\n\nWait, no. The claim says \"1 of 4 nominee for a tony award\". So in total, there were four Tony Award nominees (people), and Gary Beach was one of them.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n- Leading Actor: Gary Beach\n- Choreography: Jerry Mitchell\n- Costume Design: William Ivey Long\n\nThat's three people. But if we consider that the Best Revival category might have had multiple nominees, but it's not listed here as individuals. So perhaps in reality, there were four nominees across all categories.\n\nBut according to this table, only three individual people are nominated or won Tony Awards: Gary Beach, Jerry Mitchell, William Ivey Long. Therefore, if the claim says he was one of four, that might be incorrect based on this data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"best revival\" counts as a nominee, but it's not a person. So perhaps in terms of individual people, there are three nominees for Tony Awards: Gary Beach (nominated), Jerry Mitchell (won), and William Ivey Long (nominated). That makes three, not four. Therefore, the claim that he was one of four would be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, another possibility: maybe each row is a separate award category, so in total, there are four Tony Award categories listed with nominees. Each category has its own set of nominees. So if each category had multiple nominees, but only one per category is shown as the nomine\u00e9 who either won or was nominated.\n\nIn that case, the total number of people nominated across all categories might be more than four, but the table doesn't provide that detail. It only shows whether a specific nominee won or was nominated in their respective category.\n\nGiven this ambiguity, perhaps I need to focus strictly on what's provided. The claim is about Gary Beach being one of four nominees for a Tony Award in 2005 as per the table.\n\nLooking at the data:\n- Only three people are listed as nominees: Gary Beach (nominated), Jerry Mitchell (won), William Ivey Long (nominated). That's three.\n\nTherefore, if the claim says he was one of four, that would be FALSE because there are only three individual nominees in the Tony Awards category based on this table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"best revival\" is considered a nominee, but it's not a person. So perhaps the count includes non-person nominees, making four total, including Gary Beach. But since the claim refers to nominees (presumably people), that would still be three.\n\nSo I think the answer should be FALSE because there are only three individual nominees listed in the Tony Awards for 2005 in this table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Gary Beach was one of four nominees for a Tony Award. The table lists four entries under the Tony Award category, but only three individuals (Gary Beach, Jerry Mitchell, and William Ivey Long) are nominated or won awards. Since the claim specifies four nominees, it is incorrect based on the given data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_ cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column\": \"Nominee\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column\": \"Nominee\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column\": \"Nominee\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine whether the claim \"jerry mitchell win 2 tony award\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll examine the table structure and the data it contains. The table has seven rows, each with columns: year, award, category, nominee, result.\n\nThe claim states that Jerry Mitchell won two Tony Awards in 2005. To verify this, I need to look through each row for mentions of Jerry Mitchell and check if he won any Tony Awards.\n\nStarting with Row 1: It's about a Tony Award but the nominee is \"best revival of a musical,\" which isn't an individual, so it doesn't involve Jerry Mitchell.\n\nRow 2: This entry is also a Tony Award in a different category. The nominee here is Gary Beach, not Jerry Mitchell, so this doesn't apply.\n\nMoving to Row 3: This row mentions Jerry Mitchell as the nominee for Best Choreography at the Tony Awards, and the result is \"won.\" So that's one win for Jerry Mitchell under Tony Awards.\n\nNext, I'll check Rows 4 to 7 because they might have other entries where Jerry Mitchell could be nominated or awarded. \n\nRow 4: This is a Tony Award in the category of Best Costume Design, nominee William Ivey Long, so not related to Jerry Mitchell.\n\nRows 5,6,7 are Drama Desk Awards, which are different from Tony Awards. While Jerry Mitchell does win some awards here (as seen in Rows 6 and 7), these aren't Tony Awards, so they don't count towards the claim.\n\nSo, reviewing all rows:\n- Only Row 3 shows that Jerry Mitchell won a Tony Award.\n- No other row mentions him winning another Tony Award.\n\nTherefore, the claim that he won two Tony Awards is not supported by the table. He only has one win in the Tony category. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Jerry Mitchell only won one Tony Award as per the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"jerry mitchell be nominate for a drama desk award 3 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It seems there might be some grammatical issues, but I think it's saying that Jerry Mitchell was nominated three times for a Drama Desk Award. So, I need to check how many times he was nominated in the Drama Desk category according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an award entry with details like year, award name, category, nominee, and result. The relevant information here is the \"award\" column (to see if it's a Drama Desk Award), the \"nominee\" column (to check for Jerry Mitchell), and the \"result\" column (to confirm if he was nominated).\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to find entries where the award is a Drama Desk Award and the nominee is Jerry Mitchell.\n\n- **Row 5**: Award is Drama Desk, Category is Outstanding Revival of a Musical. Nominee is \"outstanding revival of a musical\" (the category name itself), not Jerry Mitchell. Result: Won.\n- **Row 6**: Award is Drama Desk, Category is Outstanding Choreography. Nominee is Jerry Mitchell. Result: Won. So this counts as one nomination.\n- **Row 7**: Award is Drama Desk, Category is Outstanding Costume Design. Nominee is William Ivey Long. Not relevant here.\n\nFrom this, it looks like Jerry Mitchell was only nominated once for a Drama Desk Award (specifically in the Outstanding Choreography category). There's no other row where he is listed as a nominee under a Drama Desk award.\n\nSo, based on the table, the claim that he was nominated three times is not supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"gary beach be 1 of 4 winner of a tony award\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has rows with details about awards given in 2005. Each row includes information like year, award, category, nominee, and result.\n\nThe claim mentions Gary Beach being one of four Tony Award winners. So, I need to check two things: whether Gary Beach won a Tony Award and how many Tony Awards were awarded in total according to the table.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 1: It's about Best Revival of a Musical, where the nominee is \"best revival of a musical\" and it was won. So that's one award.\n- Row 2: This is Gary Beach nominated for Best Leading Actor in a Musical. The result is \"nominated,\" which means he didn't win. So Gary Beach did not receive a Tony Award here.\n- Row 3: Jerry Mitchell won the Best Choreography Tony Award. That's another winner.\n- Rows 4 and 5 are about Drama Desk Awards, so we can ignore those since they're different awards.\n- Row 6: Jerry Mitchell also won Outstanding Choreography at the Drama Desk Awards, but again, that's not a Tony.\n- Row 7 is another Drama Desk nomination.\n\nSo, in total, looking only at the Tony Awards (rows 1,2,3,4), we see:\n\n- Row 1: Won (so one award)\n- Row 2: Nominated, didn't win\n- Row 3: Won (second award)\n- Row 4: Nominated, didn't win\n\nTherefore, there are only two Tony Awards won in the table. Since the claim says Gary Beach is one of four winners, but he didn't even win and there were only two wins total, the claim must be FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells would include all rows related to the Tony Awards, specifically checking their results to count the number of wins and whether Gary Beach was a winner.\n</think>\n\n{  \n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",  \n   \"relevant_cells\": [  \n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"award\"},  \n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},  \n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},  \n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},  \n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"award\"},  \n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},  \n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"award\"},  \n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}  \n   ]  \n}",
