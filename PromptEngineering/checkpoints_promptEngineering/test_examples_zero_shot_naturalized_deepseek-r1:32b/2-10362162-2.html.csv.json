    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 2 week in which the minnesota viking hold their opponent to zero point\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, understanding the claim: It says that there are two weeks where the Minnesota Vikings held their opponents to zero points. So I'm looking for games where the opponent's score was 0. That would mean a shutout game, where the Vikings didn't allow any points against them.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week with details like date, opponent, result, and attendance. The \"result\" column shows the outcome of the game, with the first number being the Vikings' score and the second being the opponent's score.\n\nI'll go through each row to check if any of them have a 0 in the opponent's score part of the result.\n\nRow 1: Result is L 24-7. Opponent scored 7 points. Not zero.\nRow 2: W 10-7. Opponent scored 7.\nRow 3: W 15-13. Opponent 13.\nRow 4: L 38-19. Opponent 19.\nRow 5: W 15-0. Oh, here the opponent's score is 0. That's one shutout week.\nRow 6: W 19-12. Opponent 12.\nRow 7: L 30-27. Opponent 27.\nRow 8: L 30-17. Opponent 17.\nRow 9: W 26-23. Opponent 23.\nRow 10: L 23-10. Opponent 10.\nRow 11: L 17-14. Opponent 14.\nRow 12: W 13-0. Another shutout here. That's the second week where opponent scored zero.\nRow 13: L 37-20. Opponent 20.\nRow 14: W 21-17. Opponent 17.\nRow 15: W 30-10. Opponent 10.\nRow 16: W 14-9. Opponent 9.\n\nSo I found two instances where the opponent's score was zero: Row 5 and Row 12. That means there are indeed two weeks where the Vikings held their opponents to zero points.\n\nNow, compiling the relevant cells for these findings. For each row, the key columns are \"week\" (to identify which week it is) and \"result\" (to check the score). So for rows 5 and 12, I'll note both the week and result columns as relevant.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE because there are two weeks where the opponent was held to zero points. The relevant cells include the week numbers and the results from those specific rows.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"week\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}, {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"week\"}, {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"}]}",

    "claim": "during the 1993 minnesota viking season there be 2 week in which the team do not play",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"during the 1993 minnesota viking season there be 2 week in which the team do not play\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the table structure: it has rows from week 1 to week 18, each with details like date, opponent, result, and attendance. Each row represents a game played in that week. So, if there are any weeks missing or no games scheduled, those would indicate weeks where the team didn't play.\n\nThe claim states that there were two weeks without games. I need to check if all 18 weeks have corresponding entries or if some weeks are skipped. \n\nLooking at the weeks listed:\n\n- Row 1: Week 1\n- Row 2: Week 2\n- Row 3: Week 4 (Notice, week 3 is missing)\n- Row 4: Week 5\n- Row 5: Week 6\n- Row 6: Week 8 (Week 7 is missing)\n- Rows continue up to week 18 without skipping any after that.\n\nWait, so weeks 3 and 7 are not present in the table. That means those two weeks don't have any games listed. Therefore, the Vikings didn't play during these weeks, which supports the claim of having two weeks without playing.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be the week numbers where games were skipped: week 3 (Row 3) and week 7 (which isn't present but can be inferred by checking consecutive weeks). However, since week 7 isn't listed in any row, I need to see if there's a jump from week 6 to week 8. Looking back:\n\n- Row 5 is Week 6\n- Next is Row 6: Week 8\n\nSo week 7 is missing entirely, meaning no game was played that week.\n\nSimilarly, checking the earlier weeks:\n\nRow 1: Week 1\nRow 2: Week 2\nRow 3: Week 4 (so week 3 is missing)\n\nThus, two weeks are missing: week 3 and week 7. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells to support this would be the rows where the weeks jump from week 2 to week 4 (indicating week 3 was skipped) and from week 6 to week 8 (indicating week 7 was skipped). So, the first row with Week 4 (Row 3) and the next relevant point is where it jumps to Week 8 after Week 6.\n\nWait, but since the table doesn't have a row for week 7, I need to see if any rows are missing. The table has 16 rows, but weeks go up to 18. Wait no: let's count the weeks:\n\nRows 1-2: Weeks 1-2\n\nRow3: Week4 (so week3 is missing)\n\nRows4-5: Weeks5-6\n\nRow6: Week8 (week7 is missing)\n\nThen from Row7 onwards, it goes up to week18 without skipping.\n\nSo the two weeks not played are weeks 3 and 7. Therefore, the relevant cells would be:\n\nFor week3 being skipped, the next row after week2 is week4, so row3 starts at week4, indicating that week3 was a week without a game.\n\nSimilarly, row6 jumps from week6 to week8, skipping week7.\n\nSo the relevant rows are Row 3 (week4) and Row6 (week8), as they show the skips. Alternatively, perhaps I should note where the gaps occur between consecutive weeks.\n\nBut in any case, the key is that two weeks are missing: week3 and week7. So, to support this claim, I can reference those rows where the jumps happen.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that the Minnesota Vikings played games from week 1 through week 2 (rows 1-2), then skipped to week 4 (row 3) after week 2, indicating no game in week 3. Similarly, they went from week 6 (row5) to week8 (row6), skipping week7. Thus, two weeks without games are confirmed.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Weeks Played:** The table lists weeks 1,2,4,5,6,8-18.\n2. **Spot Missing Weeks:** Week3 and week7 are missing from the sequence.\n3. **Confirm Skipped Weeks:** From row3 (week4) after week2, week3 is skipped. From row6 (week8) after week6, week7 is skipped.\n4. **Conclusion:** Two weeks without games are present.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Week\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"the game on november 21, 1993 have the lowest attendance of any game with only 40848 crowd.\" My task is to check if this statement holds true according to the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different week with details like date, opponent, result, and attendance. I need to focus on two things: the specific game on November 21, 1993, and whether its attendance is indeed the lowest across all games.\n\nI'll start by identifying which row corresponds to November 21, 1993. Scanning through the dates in each row:\n\n- Row 1: September 5\n- Row 2: September 12\n- Row 3: September 26\n- Row 4: October 3\n- Row 5: October 10\n- Row 6: October 25\n- Row 7: October 31\n- Row 8: November 7\n- Row 9: November 14\n- Row 10: November 21\n\nAh, there we go. Row 10 is the game on November 21, 1993. The attendance for this game is listed as 40848.\n\nNext, I need to check if this is the lowest attendance in the entire table. To do that, I'll list out all the attendances:\n\n- Row 1: 44120\n- Row 2: 57921\n- Row 3: 61746\n- Row 4: 63071\n- Row 5: 54215\n- Row 6: 64677\n- Row 7: 53428\n- Row 8: 55527\n- Row 9: 67329\n- Row 10: 40848\n- Row 11: 53030\n- Row 12: 63216\n- Row 13: 63321\n- Row 14: 54773\n- Row 15: 59236\n- Row 16: 42836\n\nWait a minute, looking at the attendances, I see that row 10 has 40848 and row 16 has 42836. Comparing these two, 40848 is indeed lower than 42836. However, another row (row 16) has an even lower attendance? No, wait: row 16's attendance is 42836, which is actually higher than row 10's 40848. Wait, no\u2014wait, let me double-check the numbers.\n\nWait, 40848 vs. 42836: which is lower? 40848 is less than 42836 because 40k is less than 42k. So row 10 has a lower attendance than row 16. But wait, looking again at the attendances:\n\nRow 10: 40848\n\nRow 16: 42836\n\nSo 40848 is indeed less than 42836. Therefore, the game on November 21, 1993 (row 10) has an attendance of 40,848, which is lower than row 16's 42,836.\n\nWait, but I need to check all attendances. Let me list them again in order:\n\n- Row 1: 44,120\n- Row 2: 57,921\n- Row 3: 61,746\n- Row 4: 63,071\n- Row 5: 54,215\n- Row 6: 64,677\n- Row 7: 53,428\n- Row 8: 55,527\n- Row 9: 67,329\n- Row 10: 40,848\n- Row 11: 53,030\n- Row 12: 63,216\n- Row 13: 63,321\n- Row 14: 54,773\n- Row 15: 59,236\n- Row 16: 42,836\n\nLooking at all these numbers, the smallest is row 10 with 40,848. The next lowest is row 16 with 42,836, then rows like 7 (53,428), and so on.\n\nSo yes, row 10 has the lowest attendance. Therefore, the claim that \"the game on November 21, 1993 had the lowest attendance of any game with only 40,848 crowd\" is correct.\n\nWait, but wait another moment: let me make sure I didn't miss any other row with a lower attendance. For example, row 16 has 42,836, which is higher than 40,848. All other rows have attendances above 50k except for these two.\n\nTherefore, the game on November 21, 1993 (row 10) does indeed have the lowest attendance in the table.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the game on November 21, 1993 had the lowest attendance. By examining all rows, we find that row 10 has an attendance of 40,848, which is indeed the lowest compared to all other attendances listed in the table.\n\n{  \n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",  \n   \"relevant_cells\": [  \n     { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" }  \n   ]  \n}",

The claim states: \"the game on november 14, 1993 have the lowest attendance of any game with 67329 attendee.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row corresponding to November 14, 1993 in the table. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 9 has the date \"november 14, 1993\". The opponent is Denver Broncos, and the attendance is 67329.\n\nNext, I need to check if this is indeed the lowest attendance across all games.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"during the 1993 minnesota viking season there be no week in which the team do not play\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It says that every week of the 1993 Minnesota Vikings season had a game. In other words, there were no weeks where they didn't play at all.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a week in their schedule. The weeks are numbered from 1 to 18, which is typical for an NFL season (17 regular-season games plus potentially a wildcard or divisional round). Wait, but the table has rows up to week 18, so perhaps that includes playoff games.\n\nLet me count the number of weeks in the table. The first row is week 1, and it goes up to week 18. That's 18 weeks in total. Each of these weeks has a date, opponent, result, and attendance. So, each week from 1 to 18 had a game.\n\nWait, but the NFL season typically consists of 17 weeks for regular games plus some playoff weeks. In this case, maybe weeks 17 and 18 are part of the playoffs. Regardless, the point is that every week listed has an opponent and a result, meaning they played in each week.\n\nNow, checking if there's any missing week between 1 to 18 where they didn't play. Looking through the rows:\n\n- Week 1: Played on September 5 against the Raiders.\n- Week 2: September 12 vs Bears.\n- Week 4: September 26 vs Packers (Wait, why is there a jump from week 2 to week 4? Is that an error in the table or was there no game scheduled for week 3?)\n\nHmm, this could be important. The table skips from week 2 to week 4, which might indicate that they didn't play in week 3. If that's the case, then the claim would be FALSE because there was at least one week (week 3) where they didn't have a game.\n\nBut wait, maybe the team played in week 3 but it's just not listed here. However, since the table starts with week 1 and goes up to week 18 without any gaps beyond week 2 to week 4, perhaps there was no game scheduled for week 3. That would mean they didn't play that week.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is correct, but weeks are numbered differently. For example, sometimes teams have byes or off weeks, which are not part of the regular schedule. In NFL seasons, each team typically has one bye week where they don't play. If that's the case here, then there would be a week (like week 3) without a game.\n\nSo, based on the table provided, since it jumps from week 2 to week 4 and skips week 3, it suggests that no game was played in week 3. Therefore, the claim that \"there be no week in which the team do not play\" is FALSE because they didn't play in week 3.\n\nWait a second, but I'm assuming that the table is accurate. Maybe the actual season had all weeks covered without any skips? But according to the given data, it's presented as such. So based on this specific table, there was no game in week 3, making the claim false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that every week during the 1993 Minnesota Vikings season had a game. However, the provided table jumps from Week 2 to Week 4 without any entry for Week 3. This indicates that there was at least one week (Week 3) where the team did not play, making the claim FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

For example, \"w 10 - 7\" means the Vikings won with 10 points against an opponent who scored 7.\n\nI need to check each game's opponent score. If any of these scores are zero, that would mean the Vikings held their opponent to more than zero points (since the opponent scored nothing), which would make the claim TRUE. Conversely, if all opponents scored at least one point, the claim is FALSE.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Result is \"L 24 - 7\". Opponent scored 7 points.\n2. **Row 2**: Result is \"W 10 - 7\". Opponent scored 7 points.\n3. **Row 3**: Result is \"W 15 - 13\". Opponent scored 13 points.\n4. **Row 4**: Result is \"L 38 - 19\". Opponent scored 19 points.\n5. **Row 5**: Result is \"W 15 - 0\". Here, the opponent scored 0 points. \n\nWait a minute, in Row 5, the result is \"W 15 - 0\". That means the Vikings won with 15 points and their opponent didn't score anything. So the opponent was held to zero points. This directly contradicts the claim because the claim says there's no week where the Vikings held opponents to more than zero points, but here they did hold them to exactly zero.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure I understand the claim correctly. It says \"hold their opponent to more than zero point,\" which would mean that the opponent scored zero or less? Or does it mean the Vikings prevented the opponent from scoring above zero?\n\nActually, the wording is a bit unclear. The phrase \"hold ... to more than zero points\" might be intended as the opponent scoring more than zero. But in this case, if the opponent's score was zero, that would mean the Vikings did hold them to exactly zero. So perhaps the claim is whether any week exists where the Vikings held opponents to zero or more (which they always do), but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is misworded and intended to ask if the opponent scored at least one point in every game. If that's the case, then since Row 5 has an opponent score of 0, it means the Vikings did hold them to zero points, which would mean the claim (as written) is TRUE because there exists a week where they held opponents to more than zero? Wait, no. Because \"more than zero\" would be if the opponent scored at least one point. If the opponent scored zero, that's not \"more than zero.\" So perhaps I misinterpreted.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the claim: \"there be no week in which the minnesota viking hold their opponent to more than zero point\". The structure is a bit awkward, but it seems to mean that there are no weeks where the Vikings prevented the opponent from scoring more than zero points. In other words, every game had opponents scoring at least one point.\n\nBut in Row 5, the opponent scored zero points. So that means the Vikings did have a week where they held the opponent to exactly zero, which is \"more than zero\"? No, zero is not more than zero. Wait, I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me think again: If the claim is saying there are no weeks where the opponent was held to more than zero points, that would mean in all games, the opponents scored at least one point. But in Row 5, the opponent scored zero. So this actually supports the claim because it shows a week where the opponent didn't score any points (i.e., the Vikings did hold them to more than zero? No, wait.\n\nWait, \"hold their opponent to more than zero\" means that the opponent's score is greater than zero. If in any game the opponent scored more than zero, then the claim would be false if such a week exists. But the claim says there are no weeks where this happened; so it's claiming that in every week, the opponent did not score more than zero points.\n\nBut in reality, in most rows, the opponents did score more than zero. For example, Row 1: opponent scored 7, which is more than zero. So the claim would be false because there are weeks where the opponent scored more than zero.\n\nWait, I think I'm mixing up the logic here. Let me clarify:\n\n- The claim is: There does not exist a week where the Vikings held their opponent to more than zero points.\n- In other words, for every week, the opponent did not score more than zero points (i.e., opponent's score \u2264 0).\n\nBut in reality, looking at Row 5: Opponent scored 0. So that's one case where opponent didn't score more than zero.\n\nHowever, looking at other rows:\n\n- Row 1: Opponent scored 7 (>0)\n- Row 2: 7\n- Row 3: 13\n- Row 4: 19\n- Row 5: 0\n- Let's check the rest:\n\nRow 6: Result is \"L 28 - 3\". Opponent scored 3.\nRow 7: \"W 24 - 17\" \u2192 17\nRow 8: \"L 38 - 10\" \u2192 10\nRow 9: \"L 28 - 24\" \u2192 24\nRow 10: \"W 35 - 24\" \u2192 24\nRow 11: \"L 24 - 23\" \u2192 23\nRow 12: \"W 31 - 7\" \u2192 7\n\nSo in all these weeks except Row 5, the opponents scored more than zero. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there are multiple weeks where the opponent's score was greater than zero.\n\nWait, but the initial analysis I did saw that Row 5 had an opponent score of zero, which would mean that at least one week exists where they were held to exactly zero (which is not more than zero). So the claim says \"there be no week\" where opponents are held to more than zero. But since in all other weeks except Row 5, opponents scored more than zero, the claim is clearly false because there are many such weeks.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n    ],\n    \"answer\": {\n        \"status\": \"FALSE\"\n    }\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the game on november 21, 1993 have the lowest attendance of any game with only 55527 crowd.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the table to find the one that corresponds to November 21, 1993. Scanning the rows, I see Row 8 has the date as November 21, 1993. The attendance for this game is listed as 55527.\n\nNext, I need to check if this is indeed the lowest attendance across all games in the table. I'll go through each row's attendance figure:\n\n- Row 1: 44,120\n- Row 2: 57,921\n- Row 3: 61,746\n- Row 4: 63,071\n- Row 5: 54,215\n- Row 6: 64,677\n- Row 7: 53,428\n- Row 8: 55,527 (the game in question)\n- Row 9: 67,329\n- Row 10: 40,848\n- Row 11: 53,030\n- Row 12: 63,216\n- Row 13: 63,321\n- Row 14: 54,773\n- Row 15: 59,236\n- Row 16: 42,836\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that some games have lower attendance than 55,527. For example:\n\n- Row 10: 40,848 (November 21, 1993 is actually in Row 8; wait, no, Row 10 is November 21? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the claim is about November 21, which is Row 8.

Let me list all attendances again:\n\nRow 1: 44,120\nRow 2: 57,921\nRow 3: 61,746\nRow 4: 63,071\nRow 5: 54,215\nRow 6: 64,677\nRow 7: 53,428\nRow 8: 55,527 (November 21)\nRow 9: 67,329\nRow 10: 40,848 (date is November 21? Wait no. Let me check the dates:\n\nWait, each row has a unique date. Row 8's date is November 21, but looking at all rows, I see that attendance varies.\n\nBut in my initial scan, I found that some attendances are lower than 55,527, such as Row 5: 54,215 (October 10), Row 7: 53,428 (October 31), and especially Row 10 has 40,848 on November 21? Wait no, let me check each row's date correctly.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Row 8: week 12, November 21, attendance 55,527\n- Row 10: week 12 is November 21? No. Wait, the table has 16 rows, each with different weeks and dates.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list all attendances with their corresponding rows:\n\nRow 1: 44,120 (Sep 5)\nRow 2: 57,921 (Sep 12)\nRow 3: 61,746 (Sep 19?)\nWait no, the dates are spread out. Let me correct:\n\nEach row has a different date. So, I'll list all attendances in order:\n\nRow 1: Sep 5 - 44,120\nRow 2: Sep 12 - 57,921\nRow 3: Sep 19 (week 3) - 61,746\nRow 4: week 4? Let me check the actual dates:\n\nWait, in the table provided, each row has a date. So I'll list them all with their attendance:\n\n1. Sep 5 - 44,120\n2. Sep 12 - 57,921\n3. Sep 19 (week 3) but exact date isn't given; perhaps it's another date.\nWait, actually, the table's structure isn't clear in terms of weeks and dates beyond what's provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should just list all attendances regardless of date:\n\nRow 1: 44,120\nRow 2: 57,921\nRow 3: 61,746\nRow 4: 63,071\nRow 5: 54,215\nRow 6: 64,677\nRow 7: 53,428\nRow 8: 55,527 (November 21)\nRow 9: 67,329\nRow 10: 40,848 (date is November 21?) Wait no, each row has its own date.\n\nWait, I think I confused the rows. Let me clarify:\n\nThe claim is about November 21, which is in Row 8 with attendance 55,527.\n\nNow, checking all other attendances to see if any are lower than 55,527:\n\nRow 1: 44,120 (lower)\nRow 5: 54,215 (lower)\nRow 7: 53,428 (lower)\nRow 10: 40,848 (lower)\nRow 11: 53,030 (lower)\nRow 16: 42,836 (lower)\n\nSo, multiple rows have attendances lower than 55,527. Therefore, the claim that November 21's game had the lowest attendance is incorrect because there are games with even fewer attendees.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there are games with lower attendance than 55,527 on November 21, 1993. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says, \"the game on november 14, 1993 have the highest attendance of any game with 54215 attendee.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and find all the games played in November 1993 because the claim is about a specific date in November. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 6: Week 8, October 25, 1993 (Bears) with attendance 64677.\nWait, no, that's October, so not relevant.\n\nLooking further:\n\nRow 9: Week 11, November 14, 1993. Opponent is Denver Broncos. The result was a win 26-23, and the attendance listed here is 67329. \n\nWait a second, the claim says 54215 attendees, but according to Row 9, the attendance is actually higher than that\u201467329. So this suggests that the attendance number in the claim might be incorrect.\n\nNow I need to check if November 14th's game indeed has the highest attendance. Let me look through all other games' attendance numbers:\n\n- Week 2: September 12, 57921\n- Week 3: September 26, 61746\n- Week 4: October 3, 63071\n- Week 5: October 10, 54215 (Wait, that's the attendance for Tampa Bay Buccaneers on October 10)\n- Week 6: October 25, 64677\n- Week 8: November 7, 55527\n- Week 9: November 14, 67329\n- Week 10: November 21, 40848\n- Week 11: November 28, 53030\n- Week 12: December 5, 63216\n- Week 13: December 12, 63321\n- Week 14: December 19, 54773\n- Week 15: December 26, 59236\n- Week 16: December 31, 42836\n\nLooking at these numbers, the highest attendance seems to be in Row 9 with 67329. That's higher than any other week.\n\nBut wait, the claim mentions \"november 14, 1993\" with an attendance of 54215. According to the table, November 14 has 67329, which is much higher than 54215. Also, the highest attendance overall isn't 54215; it's actually 67329 on that date.\n\nMoreover, looking at Week 5 (October 10), the attendance was 54215 against Tampa Bay. So the claim is mixing up two different games: November 14th and October 10th, perhaps? Because the attendance numbers don't match for the specified date in the claim.\n\nSo, the claim states that on November 14, 1993, there were 54215 attendees, which is incorrect because it was actually 67329. Also, this isn't the highest attendance; it's just another game. The highest was indeed 67329 on November 14th.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, in my initial analysis, I saw that Row 5 (October 10) had 54215 and Row 9 had 67329. So the claim is saying that the game on Nov 14 had the highest attendance with 54k, but according to the table, it's actually higher than that. Therefore, the claim is false because it states an incorrect attendance number for that date and also implies that this was the highest, which isn't correct as there are higher attendances elsewhere.\n\nWait again, looking back at all rows:\n\nLooking at each row's attendance:\n\nRow 1: 44120\n\nRow 2: 57921\n\nRow3:61746\n\nRow4:63071\n\nRow5:54215\n\nRow6:64677\n\nRow7: ?\n\nWait, maybe I need to list all attendances properly:\n\nLet me go row by row with their attendances:\n\n- Row 1 (Week1): 44120\n- Row2 (Week2): 57921\n- Row3 (Week3):61746\n- Row4 (Week4):63071\n- Row5 (Week5):54215\n- Row6 (Week6):64677\n- Row7: Week7? No, the table seems to have 16 rows, but I only see up to row9 as per initial data. Wait, perhaps it's better to list all attendances in order:\n\nLooking at each week:\n\n- Week2 (Row2):57k\n\nWeek3:61k\n\nWeek4:63k\n\nWeek5:54k\n\nWeek6:64k\n\nWeek8:55k\n\nWeek9:67k\n\nWeek10:40k\n\nWeek11:53k\n\nWeek12:63k\n\nWeek13:63k\n\nWeek14:54k\n\nWeek15:59k\n\nWeek16:42k\n\nSo the highest is 67k in Week11 (Row9). Therefore, the claim that November 14th had 54k attendees is incorrect because it was actually 67k. Also, since another game (Week6) had 64k, which is higher than 54k but less than 67k.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false on two counts: first, the attendance number is wrong for that date, and second, even if it were correct, it's not the highest. The actual highest was 67k on November 14th.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"the game on november 14, 1993 have the highest attendance of any game with 54215 attendee.\" So according to the table, that date had 67k, which is higher than 54k. Therefore, the claim is wrong in two aspects: it's not 54k, and also, there are other games with higher attendances (like Week6 at 64k). Wait no\u2014Week9 is the highest.\n\nSo the correct answer should be that the claim is FALSE because the attendance on November 14 was actually higher than stated, and furthermore, it's not the highest since there might be another game with higher? Or wait, in this case, Week9 (November 14) has the highest at 67k. So the claim incorrectly states that attendance as 54k, making it wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because the attendance was actually 67329 on November 14, not 54215, and thus the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE. The game on November 14, 1993, had an attendance of 67,329, not 54,215 as stated in the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So that's 16 games, covering all weeks from 1 to 18 except week 3 and week 7 are missing?

Therefore, there are only 16 games instead of 17 or 18? Or perhaps the season had fewer weeks.\n\nAssuming that's correct, then total wins are 9, losses are 7. But the claim is 8 wins and 6 losses. That doesn't add up.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted.

That's 9 wins.\n\nLosses are weeks 1,5,9,10,12,13,15. That's 7 losses.\n\nSo total games: 9 +7=16. So the claim of 8 wins and 6 losses is incorrect because it's actually 9 wins and 7 losses.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Minnesota Vikings won 8 games and lost 6 in the 1993 season.
