    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"both leverstock green and nash mill school be ce affiliated\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided in naturalized format. There are 11 rows, each representing a different school with various attributes like name, faith, type, DCSF number, and Ofsted number.\n\nThe claim mentions two schools: \"leverstock green\" and \"nash mill.\" Wait, the second one is written as \"nash mills\" in the table. I should make sure to check if that's a typo or intentional. For now, I'll proceed with \"nash mill\" but keep in mind it might be a slight variation.\n\nNext, I need to find each of these schools in the table and check their faith affiliation, specifically whether they are \"ce\" (Church of England) affiliated.\n\nStarting with \"leverstock green\": Looking through the rows, row 4 has the name \"leverstock green.\" The faith column for this row is listed as \"ce.\" So, leverstock green is indeed ce-affiliated.\n\nNow, checking for \"nash mill school.\" In the table, I see a school named \"nash mills\" in row 6. Its faith is also listed as \"ce.\" Since \"nash mill\" and \"nash mills\" are very similar, it's reasonable to assume they're referring to the same school. Therefore, nash mills (and by extension, possibly nash mill) is ce-affiliated.\n\nBoth schools mentioned in the claim have their faith set to \"ce,\" which means the claim that both are ce-affiliated holds true.\n\nTo compile the relevant cells for this verification:\n- For leverstock green: row 4, column 'faith'\n- For nash mills (assuming it's the same as nash mill): row 6, column 'faith'\n\nThese two cells confirm both schools' affiliations. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both Leverstock Green and Nash Mill School are CE affiliated. By checking the table:\n\n1. **Leverstock Green** is found in Row 4 with faith listed as \"ce.\"\n2. **Nash Mills** (which we assume refers to \"nash mill\" in the claim) is found in Row 6, also with faith listed as \"ce.\"\n\nBoth schools are indeed CE-affiliated.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"faith\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"faith\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"8 primary school in dacorum be not affiliate with church\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It seems a bit awkwardly phrased, but I think it's saying that there are 8 primary schools in Dacorum that are not affiliated with any church. So my task is to verify if exactly eight of the listed schools are primary and have no religious affiliation.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a school with various details. The key columns here are \"name,\" \"faith,\" and \"type.\" Since the claim mentions primary schools, I'll focus on rows where the type is 'primary.' Additionally, the faith column indicates whether a school is affiliated with a church or not. If the faith is marked as '-', it likely means no affiliation.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1: belswains**  \n   Type: primary, Faith: -  \n   This counts towards our count of non-affiliated primary schools.\n\n2. **Row 2: chambersbury**  \n   Type: primary, Faith: -  \n   Another non-affiliated primary school.\n\n3. **Row 3: hobbs hill wood**  \n   Type: primary, Faith: -  \n   Third one.\n\n4. **Row 4: leverstock green**  \n   Type: primary, Faith: ce (Church of England)  \n   Affiliated, so this doesn't count.\n\n5. **Row 5: lime walk**  \n   Type: primary, Faith: -  \n   Fourth non-affiliated school.\n\n6. **Row 6: nash mills**  \n   Type: primary, Faith: ce  \n   Affiliated, so skip.\n\n7. **Row 7: reddings**  \n   Type: primary, Faith: -  \n   Fifth one.\n\n8. **Row 8: st albert the great**  \n   Type: primary, Faith: rc (Roman Catholic)  \n   Affiliated, so not counted.\n\n9. **Row 9: tudor**  \n   Type: primary, Faith: -  \n   Sixth non-affiliated school.\n\n10. **Row 10: two waters**  \n    Type: primary, Faith: -  \n    Seventh one.\n\n11. **Row 11: woodfield**  \n    Type: special, Faith: -  \n    Since type is 'special,' not relevant for our count.\n\nSo, counting all the rows where the type is primary and faith is '-', we have:\n\n- belswains\n- chambersbury\n- hobbs hill wood\n- lime walk\n- reddings\n- tudor\n- two waters\n\nThat's a total of 7 schools. The claim states there are 8 such schools, but according to my count, it's only 7. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nI should also note which cells were relevant for this check. For each row, I looked at both the 'type' and 'faith' columns. So, for every row from 1 to 10 (since row 11 has type special), I checked these two fields.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"faith\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"faith\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"faith\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"faith\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"faith\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"faith\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"faith\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"faith\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"faith\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"faith\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"4 schools have a dcsf number greater than 3000, but only 1 school has a dcsf number greater than 7000.\" \n\nI need to check each row in the table and count how many times the 'dcsf number' is above 3000 and then how many are above 7000.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 11 rows. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nRow 1: dcsf number 2466. That's less than 3000.\nRow 2: 2210. Also less than 3000.\nRow 3: 2469. Still under 3000.\nRow 4: 3054. This is above 3000, so that's one.\nRow 5: 2422. Below 3000.\nRow 6: 3302. Above 3000, that's two.\nRow 7: 2251. Below.\nRow 8: 3391. That's three.\nRow 9: 2045. Nope.\nRow 10: 2044. No.\nRow 11: 7025. This is both above 3000 and also the only one above 7000.\n\nSo, how many are over 3000? Let's count:\n\n- Row 4: 3054\n- Row 6: 3302\n- Row 8: 3391\n- Row 11: 7025\n\nThat makes four schools with dcsf numbers over 3000. \n\nNow, how many are over 7000? Only row 11 has 7025, which is the only one exceeding 7000.\n\nSo the claim states both conditions correctly: four schools have dcsf numbers greater than 3000, and exactly one school exceeds 7000. \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately reflects the data in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim again: \"only 1 of the 11 school be not list as a primary type school, and it be list as a special type school.\" Okay, so there are two parts to this statement:\n\n1. Only one out of the eleven schools is not listed as a primary type.\n2. That particular school is listed as a special type.\n\nI need to check each condition against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, it has 11 rows (from Row 1 to Row 11). Each row represents a school with various attributes including 'type'. My focus should be on the 'type' column because the claim is about whether the schools are primary or not.\n\nLet me go through each row and check the 'type':\n\n- Row 1: type: primary\n- Row 2: type: primary\n- Row 3: type: primary\n- Row 4: type: primary\n- Row 5: type: primary\n- Row 6: type: primary\n- Row 7: type: primary\n- Row 8: type: primary\n- Row 9: type: primary\n- Row 10: type: primary\n- Row 11: type: special\n\nWait, so in row 11, the type is 'special'. That seems to be the only one that's not 'primary'. All other rows from 1 to 10 have 'type' as 'primary'.\n\nSo according to this, only one school (Row 11) isn't primary and it's special. That aligns with both parts of the claim.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Are there any other schools besides Row 11 that aren't listed as primary? Scanning through all rows again, yes, only Row 11 has a type different from 'primary', and it's 'special'. \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because exactly one school isn't primary and it's correctly noted as special.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm given a table with information about various schools, and I need to determine if the claim \"all of the primary school have ofsted number greater than 117107\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the table. There are 11 rows, each representing a different school with details like name, faith, type, dcsf number, and ofsted number. My focus here is on two columns: 'type' to identify primary schools and 'ofsted number' to check their values.\n\nThe claim states that all primary schools have an Ofsted number greater than 117107. To verify this, I need to go through each row, check if the school type is primary, and then ensure its Ofsted number meets the criteria.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Row 1: belswains - type is primary. Its Ofsted number is 117365, which is greater than 117107.\n2. Row 2: chambersbury - type is primary. Ofsted number is 117214, also greater.\n3. Row 3: hobbs hill wood - type is primary. Ofsted number is 117368, which qualifies.\n4. Row 4: leverstock green - type is primary (and faith ce). Ofsted number is 117416, good.\n5. Row 5: lime walk - primary school with Ofsted 117333, meets the condition.\n6. Row 6: nash mills - primary, Ofsted 117418, correct.\n7. Row 7: reddings - primary, Ofsted number 117234, passes.\n8. Row 8: st albert the great - type is primary (faith rc). Ofsted number is 117471, which is higher than 117107.\n9. Row 9: tudor - primary school with Ofsted 117109. Wait a minute, 117109 is just above 117107 by 2, so it's still greater.\n10. Row 10: two waters - also primary. Its Ofsted number is 117108, which is exactly one more than 117107. So that's still acceptable as it's greater.\n11. Row 11: woodfield - type is special, so we can ignore this row since the claim is about primary schools.\n\nWait a second, did I miss any rows where the Ofsted number might be less than or equal to 117107? Let me double-check each primary school's Ofsted number:\n\n- Row 9: tudor has 117109 (greater)\n- Row 10: two waters has 117108 (greater)\n\nHmm, both are just above the threshold. So actually, all primary schools do have Ofsted numbers greater than 117107. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that maybe there was a school with exactly 117108 or 117109, but since 117108 is just one more than 117107, it's still greater. So all primary schools in the table meet the condition.\n\nWait again, looking back at the rows:\n\nRow 10: two waters has Ofsted number 117108 (greater)\nRow 9: tudor is 117109 (also greater)\n\nSo no primary school has an Ofsted number less than or equal to 117107. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n\nWait, but let me check if all primary schools have been accounted for correctly. There are rows 1 through 10 with type 'primary' except row 11 which is special. So all relevant rows (rows 1-10) are primary and their Ofsted numbers are above 117107.\n\nSo yes, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"ofsted number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ofsted number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"ofsted number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"ofsted number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"ofsted number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"ofsted number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"ofsted number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"ofsted number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"ofsted number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"ofsted number\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim mentions \"leverstock green\" as being the only CE-affiliated school.\n\nCE stands for Church of England, so I should check the 'faith' column to see which schools are affiliated with CE. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Name is belswains, faith is '-'. So not CE.\nRow 2: chambersbury, faith '-'. Not CE.\nRow 3: hobbs hill wood, faith '-'. Not CE.\nRow 4: leverstock green, faith 'ce'. Yes, this one is CE-affiliated.\nRow 5: lime walk, faith '-'. Not CE.\nRow 6: nash mills, faith 'ce'. Another CE-affiliated school here.\nRow 7: reddings, faith '-'. Not CE.\nRow 8: st albert the great, faith 'rc' (which I think stands for Roman Catholic). So not CE.\nRows 9 and 10: tudor and two waters, both have '-' in faith. Not CE.\nRow 11: woodfield, but it's a special type school with '-', so no.\n\nWait, the claim says leverstock green is the only CE-affiliated school. But looking at row 6, nash mills also has 'ce' in the faith column. That means there are two schools affiliated with CE. Therefore, the claim isn't true because there's another school, nash mills, that's also CE.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE. Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The key is the 'faith' column for each row. Since we found that both leverstock green (row 4) and nash mills (row 6) have 'ce', those are the relevant cells.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim \"more than 8 primary school in dacorum be affiliate with church\" is true or false based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The key points here are:\n1. We're talking about primary schools in Dacorum.\n2. These schools should be affiliated with a church.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are 11 rows, each representing a school. Each row has information like name, faith, type, DCFS number, and Ofsted number. The relevant columns for this claim would be \"faith\" because it tells us about the affiliation and \"type\" to confirm if they're primary schools.\n\nSo, my approach is:\n- Check how many of these 11 schools are primary.\n- Among those primary schools, count how many have a faith that indicates church affiliation. The possible values in the 'faith' column seem to be '-', 'ce', or 'rc'. I think 'ce' stands for Church of England and 'rc' for Roman Catholic, both indicating church affiliations.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 1: belswains** - Type is primary, Faith is '-'. Since faith is '-', it's not affiliated with a church.\n2. **Row 2: chambersbury** - Primary school, Faith '-'. Not affiliated.\n3. **Row 3: hobbs hill wood** - Primary, Faith '-'. Not affiliated.\n4. **Row 4: leverstock green** - Primary, Faith 'ce'. Affiliated with Church of England.\n5. **Row 5: lime walk** - Primary, Faith '-'. Not affiliated.\n6. **Row 6: nash mills** - Primary, Faith 'ce'. Affiliated.\n7. **Row 7: reddings** - Primary, Faith '-'. Not affiliated.\n8. **Row 8: st albert the great** - Primary, Faith 'rc'. Affiliated with Roman Catholic Church.\n9. **Row 9: tudor** - Primary, Faith '-'. Not affiliated.\n10. **Row 10: two waters** - Primary, Faith '-'. Not affiliated.\n11. **Row 11: woodfield** - Type is special, so it's not a primary school.\n\nNow, counting the primary schools:\nTotal primary schools = Rows 1-10 (since Row 11 is special). That's 10 primary schools.\n\nOut of these, how many are church-affiliated?\nLooking back, only rows 4, 6, and 8 have faith 'ce' or 'rc'. So that's 3 schools.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says \"more than 8\". But according to my count, only 3 primary schools in Dacorum are affiliated with a church. \n\nSo, is 3 more than 8? Definitely not. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that more than 8 primary schools in Dacorum are affiliated with a church. Upon examining the table, there are only 10 primary schools listed, of which 3 have faith affiliations (either 'ce' or 'rc'), indicating they are linked to the Church of England or Roman Catholic Church. Since 3 is not more than 8, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"faith\"},\n     {\"row_1\": 1, \"column_name\": \"faith\"},\n     {\"row_2\": 2, \"column_name\": \"faith\"},\n     {\"row_3\": 3, \"column_name\": \"faith\"},\n     {\"row_4\": 4, \"column_name\": \"faith\"},\n     {\"row_5\": 5, \"column_name\": \"faith\"},\n     {\"row_6\": 6, \"column_name\": \"faith\"},\n     {\"row_7\": 7, \"column_name\": \"faith\"},\n     {\"row_8\": 8, \"column_name\": \"faith\"},\n     {\"row_9\": 9, \"column_name\": \"faith\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"4 school have a dcsf number greater than 7000\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the table represents.\n\nThe table has several rows, each representing a school with details like name, faith, type, dcsf number, and ofsted number. The claim specifically mentions the \"dcsf number,\" so I should focus on that column.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: belswains, dcsf number 2466\n- Row 2: chambersbury, 2210\n- Row 3: hobbs hill wood, 2469\n- Row 4: leverstock green, 3054\n- Row 5: lime walk, 2422\n- Row 6: nash mills, 3302\n- Row 7: reddings, 2251\n- Row 8: st albert the great, 3391\n- Row 9: tudor, 2045\n- Row 10: two waters, 2044\n- Row 11: woodfield, 7025\n\nThe claim states that four schools have a dcsf number greater than 7000. I'll go through each row and check the dcsf numbers:\n\n1. belswains - 2466 (less than 7000)\n2. chambersbury - 2210 (less than 7000)\n3. hobbs hill wood - 2469 (less than 7000)\n4. leverstock green - 3054 (still less than 7000)\n5. lime walk - 2422\n6. nash mills - 3302\n7. reddings - 2251\n8. st albert the great - 3391\n9. tudor - 2045\n10. two waters - 2044\n11. woodfield - 7025\n\nNow, looking for numbers greater than 7000: The only one that stands out is woodfield with 7025 in row 11. All other dcsf numbers are below 7000.\n\nThe claim says four schools have a dcsf number over 7000, but according to the table, only one school meets this condition. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nFor the relevant cells, I need to list all rows where the dcsf number was checked, which includes each row's \"dcsf number\" column. So, from row_index 0 to 10, each has a \"dcsf number\" that was examined.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because only one school (woodfield) has a dcsf number above 7000.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"dcsf number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"dcsf number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"dcsf number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"dcsf number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"dcsf number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"dcsf number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"dcsf number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"dcsf number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"dcsf number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"dcsf number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"dcsf number\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"none of the primary school have ofsted number greater than 117107\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that none of the primary schools in the table have an Ofsted number higher than 117107. So, I need to check each row to see if any primary school has an Ofsted number exceeding that value.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 11 rows, each representing a different school with details like name, faith, type, DCSF number, and Ofsted number. The claim is specifically about primary schools, so I should focus on rows where the 'type' is 'primary'.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Type is primary, Ofsted number is 117365.\n- This is higher than 117107, so if this is a primary school, it would make the claim FALSE.\n\nWait, but before I jump to conclusions, let me check all rows just to be thorough.\n\nRow 2: Type is primary, Ofsted number 117214. That's also higher than 117107.\nRow 3: Primary, Ofsted 117368. Again, higher.\nRow 4: Primary, Ofsted 117416. Higher.\nRow 5: Primary, Ofsted 117333. Higher.\nRow 6: Primary, Ofsted 117418. Higher.\nRow 7: Primary, Ofsted 117234. Higher.\nRow 8: Primary, Ofsted 117471. Higher.\nRow 9: Primary, Ofsted 117109. This is just slightly above 117107.\nRow 10: Primary, Ofsted 117108. Also above.\nRow 11: Special school, so we can ignore this one.\n\nWait a minute, all primary schools except maybe row 10 and 9? Let me check the numbers again:\n\n- Row 1: 117365\n- Row 2: 117214\n- Row 3: 117368\n- Row 4: 117416\n- Row 5: 117333\n- Row 6: 117418\n- Row 7: 117234\n- Row 8: 117471\n- Row 9: 117109 (which is greater than 117107)\n- Row 10: 117108 (also greater)\n\nSo every primary school in the table has an Ofsted number higher than 117107. Therefore, the claim that \"none of the primary schools have an Ofsted number greater than 117107\" is definitely FALSE because all of them do.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells, I need to list each row's 'Ofsted number' where it's a primary school and the number is above 117107. Since all primary schools in the table meet this condition, I'll include rows 1 through 10 (since row 11 is special). Each of these rows has their Ofsted number exceeding 117107.\n\nWait, but let me double-check row 9 and 10. Row 9's Ofsted number is 117109, which is just two more than 117107, so yes, it's higher. Similarly, row 10 has 117108, which is also higher.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE because all primary schools have Ofsted numbers greater than 117107.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE as all primary schools in the table have Ofsted numbers exceeding 117107. Each relevant cell from rows 1 to 10 (columns 'Ofsted number') supports this conclusion.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"ofsted number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ofsted number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"ofsted number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"ofsted number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"ofsted number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"ofsted number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"ofsted number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"ofsted number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"ofsted number\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"ofsted number\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
