    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's figure out whether the claim \"prince park be home to the carlton team\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. Each row represents a game with details like home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd, and date. The dates are all 14 July 1945 for each match.\n\nThe claim is about Prince Park being the home ground of Carlton. So I'm looking for any row where the home team is Carlton and the venue is Prince Park.\n\nLooking at Row 3: Home team is Carlton, venue is Princes park. Wait, but in the table it's written as \"princes park\" with a lowercase 'p' after Princes? Or maybe it's just a typo or variation in spelling. In any case, the key point is that Carlton's home game was at Princes Park (assuming that's what it says), which would mean that Prince Park is their venue.\n\nWait, but I should check if \"Prince Park\" and \"Princes Park\" are considered the same. The claim uses \"prince park\", while the table has \"princes park\". It might be a slight variation in spelling or name usage. But for the purpose of this task, since both refer to the same place with similar names, it's reasonable to consider them as the same venue.\n\nSo, in Row 3, Carlton is the home team and the venue is Princes Park (or Prince Park). Therefore, the claim is TRUE because the table shows that Carlton played at their home ground, which was Prince Park.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Home team: Carlton (Row 3)\n- Venue: Princes park (Row 3)\n\nSo I'll list both these columns for Row 3 as the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
