    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"at kansas city chief be the opponent in week 14 with an attendance of 74524\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into its components:\n1. The opponent is the Kansas City Chiefs.\n2. This game was in week 14.\n3. The attendance for that game was 74,524.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row of the table to check these conditions.\n\nLooking at week 14 (row 14):\n- Opponent: kansas city chiefs\n- Attendance: 77778\n\nWait a minute, the attendance in row 14 is 77,778, not 74,524. That's different from what the claim states.\n\nBut I should double-check if there are any other rows where the opponent was the Kansas City Chiefs and week 14 elsewhere. Scanning through the table:\n\nRow 4: Week 4 vs. kansas city chiefs with attendance 75037\nRow 14: Week 14 vs. kansas city chiefs with attendance 77778\n\nSo, in week 14, the opponent was indeed the Kansas City Chiefs, but the attendance was 77,778, not 74,524 as claimed. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because the attendance doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me look again. The claim says week 14 with an attendance of 74,524. Checking row 14: attendance is 77,778. So it's higher than claimed. That means the attendance figure in the claim doesn't align with what's in the table.\n\nSo both conditions about opponent and week are correct, but the attendance is wrong. Therefore, the entire claim isn't fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that against the Kansas City Chiefs in week 14, the attendance was 74,524. However, according to row 14 of the table, the opponent was indeed the Kansas City Chiefs in week 14, but the attendance was 77,778, not 74,524.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
