    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"michael bradley jelani mccoy (14) have the highest rebound against miami\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim to understand what it's asserting. It mentions two players, Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy, with 14 rebounds each in a game against Miami. The claim states that they had the highest rebounds in that specific game.\n\nNext, I need to look at the table provided to find the relevant information. The table lists multiple games from April 1 to April 16, involving different teams and opponents. My goal is to identify the row where Detroit played against Miami because the claim specifies \"against miami.\"\n\nLooking through the rows:\n- Row 5 (Game 77) has the opponent as Miami, with a score of L 83 - 89 on April 8.\n- Checking other rows, I see that there are multiple games against teams like New Jersey, San Antonio, Orlando, Milwaukee, and Cleveland, but only one game against Miami in this table.\n\nNow, focusing on Row 5 (Game 77), the columns to check are:\n1. **Team**: Confirms it's Detroit playing against Miami.\n2. **High rebounds**: This column lists players with the highest rebounds in that game. According to the row, Michael Bradley has 8 rebounds and Jelani McCoy also has 8 rebounds.\n\nThe claim states that they had 14 rebounds each. However, Row 5 shows both having only 8 rebounds. Additionally, I should check if there are any other games against Miami elsewhere in the table, but from a quick scan, it seems this is the only game against Miami mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the claim's assertion of 14 rebounds doesn't match the data in the table where both players had 8 rebounds each. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy each had 14 rebounds against Miami. According to Row 5 (Game 77), both players had only 8 rebounds each, not 14.\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
