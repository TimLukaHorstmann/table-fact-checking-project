    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"66189 crowd attend the new orleans saint game with a record of 6 - 1\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. **Crowd Attendance**: 66189\n2. **Opponent**: New Orleans Saints\n3. **Record After Game**: 6-1\n\nNow, I need to verify each of these against the table.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Rows with Opponent as New Orleans Saints**\n\nLooking through the rows, I see two entries where the opponent is the New Orleans Saints:\n\n- Row 7: Week 7\n- Row 14: Week 14\n\n**Step 2: Check Attendance for These Rows**\n\n- **Row 7**: The attendance is listed as 66189.0.\n- **Row 14**: The attendance is 70332.0.\n\nThe claim mentions an attendance of 66189, which matches Row 7's attendance.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the Record After the Game**\n\nIn Row 7, after their game against the New Orleans Saints on October 28, 2001, the record is shown as 6-1. This aligns with the claim stating the record was 6-1 following that game.\n\n**Step 4: Cross-Checking for Any Discrepancies**\n\nI should ensure there are no other rows where the opponent is New Orleans Saints and attendance is 66189. From the table, only Row 7 matches both the opponent and attendance figures.\n\nAdditionally, confirming the direction of the result in Row 7 shows it's a loss (L), but that doesn't affect the attendance or record stated in the claim.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll components of the claim are accurately reflected in Row 7 of the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"66084 crowd attend the indianapolis colt game on december 30 , 2001\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim and identify the key pieces of information: the attendance number (66084), the opponent (Indianapolis Colts), and the date (December 30, 2001). \n\nI need to find the row in the table that corresponds to the Indianapolis Colts game on December 30, 2001. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 16: Week 16, Date December 30, 2001, Opponent Indianapolis Colts.\n\nLooking at this row, I'll check the relevant columns for attendance and date to see if they match the claim.\n\nThe attendance in row 16 is listed as 66084.0, which matches exactly with the claim of 66084. The opponent is indeed the Indianapolis Colts, and the date is December 30, 2001. \n\nSo both the attendance number and the specific game details match the claim. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nTo structure this into the required JSON format, I'll note the relevant cells from row 16 for 'attendance' and 'date'. The opponent's column isn't necessary since it's already specified in the claim, but including all three for thoroughness might be better, though the instructions don't specify whether to include all or just those directly answering the claim. However, based on the example provided, I think they're asking for cells that are relevant to verifying each part of the claim.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would include 'attendance', 'opponent', and 'date' from row 16.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"66189 crowd attend the game with a record of 6 - 1 on week 8\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at each part of the claim and find the corresponding information in the table. The claim mentions three things: attendance (66189), record (6-1), and week number (week 8). \n\nLooking through the table rows, let me check for week 8 specifically. Scanning row by row:\n\nRow 1 is week 1, Row 2 week 2, up to Row 7 which is week 7. Then Row 8 is marked as week 8. Let's look at what information is provided in Row 8.\n\nIn the table, for week 8 (Row 8), I see that all columns are either \"-\", \"nan\", or empty. The opponent, date, result, and record are all missing or not filled. That means there's no data available for week 8 in this table. \n\nThe claim states that on week 8, the attendance was 66189 with a record of 6-1. But since Row 8 has no data, I can't confirm any of those details from the given information.\n\nWait, but looking again, maybe I made a mistake? Let me check other rows to see if week 8 is perhaps listed elsewhere or if there's an error in numbering. No, the weeks go up correctly from 1 to 17, so Row 8 is indeed week 8. \n\nSince all data for week 8 is missing, there's no way to verify that attendance was 66189 or that their record was 6-1 on that week. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the table.\n\nSo, I think the answer should be FALSE because there's insufficient information in the table to support the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to week 8, which has no data in the table. Without attendance or record details for week 8, the claim cannot be verified.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
