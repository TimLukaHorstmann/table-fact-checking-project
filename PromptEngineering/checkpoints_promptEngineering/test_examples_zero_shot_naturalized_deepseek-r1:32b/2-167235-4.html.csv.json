    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri live to be the oldest prime minister , 1872 - 1963\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n1. Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri is mentioned as a prime minister.\n2. He lived from 1872 to 1963.\n3. The claim suggests he was the oldest prime minister.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists five rows of prime ministers from 1928-1939. Let me examine each relevant cell:\n\nRow 4 contains information about Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri:\n- Name: mehdi bej frash\u00ebri (1st time)\n- Born-Died: 1872 - 1963\n- Term Start: 22 October 1935\n- Term End: 9 November 1936\n- Political Party: non-party\n\nSo, from the table, his lifespan is indeed 1872 to 1963. Now, I need to check if he was the oldest prime minister among those listed.\n\nLooking at the other rows:\n- Row 2: Kostaq Kota (1st time), born in 1889, died 1949\n- Row 3: Pandeli Evangjeli (2nd time), born 1859, died 1939\n- Row 5: Kostaq Kota (2nd time), same as row 2\n\nComparing their birth years:\n- Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri was born in 1872.\n- Pandeli Evangjeli was born earlier, in 1859. \n\nSo, while Mehdi lived longer than Kostaq, Pandeli was born earlier. However, the claim is about being the oldest when he served, not necessarily the longest-lived.\n\nWait, but the table only lists prime ministers from 1928-1939. The claim is that Mehdi was the oldest prime minister in this context. But looking at their ages during their terms:\n\nMehdi's term was from October 1935 to November 1936. At that time, he would have been around 63 years old (born 1872). Pandeli Evangjeli served from March 1930 to October 1935; he was born in 1859, making him about 70-76 during his term. Kostaq Kota, born 1889, would be around 40s when serving.\n\nSo, actually, Pandeli Evangjeli was older than Mehdi when they served as prime ministers. Therefore, the claim that Mehdi was the oldest prime minister in this table is false because Pandeli was older during his tenure.\n\nAdditionally, looking at their death years:\n- Mehdi died in 1963\n- Pandeli died in 1939\n\nSo, while Mehdi lived longer overall, during their terms in office, Pandeli was older. Therefore, the claim is not accurate as per the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri was the oldest prime minister among those listed, but according to the table, Pandeli Evangjeli was older when he served. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"born - died\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"born - died\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is that \"kostaq kota's term started on 9 November 1936 after mehdi bej frash\u00ebri's term ended.\"\n\nFirst, I need to check when Mehdi Bej Frasheri's term ended and when Kostaq Kota's second term began. Looking at the table:\n\n- Row 4 is about Mehdi Bej Frasheri (1st time). His term started on October 22, 1935, and ended on November 9, 1936.\n- Then, looking for Kostaq Kota's second term in row 5: his term starts on November 9, 1936.\n\nSo, according to the table, Mehdi Bej Frasheri's term ends exactly when Kostaq Kota's second term begins. That would mean Kostaq Kota started right after Mehdi's term ended.\n\nBut wait, does \"after\" imply that there was a time in between? If the end and start dates are the same day, it's not technically \"after\" but simultaneous. However, sometimes in such contexts, if one ends on the 9th and another starts on the same date, it might be considered as the next term starting immediately after.\n\nBut strictly speaking, if Mehdi ended on November 9 and Kostaq started on November 9, there's no time gap between them. So, is \"after\" in the claim referring to the same day or a subsequent day? The table doesn't show any days beyond November 9 for Mehdi, so Kostaq starts on the same day.\n\nTherefore, the claim says that Kostaq started after Mehdi's term ended, but since both dates are the same, it might not be accurate. Alternatively, if \"after\" includes the same day as the start, then it could still be considered TRUE.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused about whether starting on the exact end date counts as \"after.\" In some contexts, \"after\" implies strictly later in time, which would require Kostaq's term to start on November 10 or later. But if the same day is acceptable, then it's TRUE.\n\nLooking back at the table, there's no row between Mehdi and Kostaq, so their terms are consecutive without a gap. Therefore, the claim that Kostaq started after Mehdi ended could be considered correct because his term began on the same date Mehdi's ended. So I think it's TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Kostaq Kota's second term starts on the same day as Mehdi Bej Frasheri's term ends.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"term end\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"term start\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim mentions two individuals: Kostaq Kota and Mehdi Bej Frasheri. It states that both were the first-time Prime Ministers of Albania.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 2 is about Kostaq Kota (1st time). His term started on September 5, 1928. The term \"1st time\" suggests this was his initial tenure as PM.\n\nRow 4 is about Mehdi Bej Frasheri (1st time). His term started on October 22, 1935. Similarly, it's marked as his first time in office.\n\nThe claim says both were the first-time PMs. The table confirms that each of them served as Prime Minister for their respective first terms. However, I need to check if they were indeed both serving their first terms at any point between 1928-1939.\n\nWait a second, the table shows Kostaq Kota's first term from September 5, 1928, to March 5, 1930. Then he served again later (row 5). Mehdi Bej Frasheri was PM for his first time starting in October 1935.\n\nSo the claim is correct that both were first-time PMs during this period. They each had their initial terms within the 1928-1939 timeframe, just at different times.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Individuals in Claim:** The claim mentions Kostaq Kota and Mehdi Bej Frasheri.\n\n2. **Check Their Terms as PMs:**\n   - Kostaq Kota served two terms. His first term was from 1928 to 1930 (Row 2).\n   - Mehdi Bej Frasheri also had a first term starting in 1935 (Row 4).\n\n3. **Verify \"First Time\" Reference:** Both were indeed serving their initial terms as PM within the given period.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_2\": \"prime ministers 1928-1939\", column_1st_time\": true},\n     {\"row_4\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_4\": \"prime ministers 1928-1939\", column_1st_time\": true}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\n(Note: The exact JSON structure may vary based on the table's actual columns, but it should include the relevant rows and columns for both individuals' first terms.)\n\nHowever, since I can't provide JSON in this format here, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine whether the claim \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri live to be the second oldest prime minister after pandeli evangjeli\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each part of the claim means. The claim states that Mehdi Bej Frasheri was the second oldest prime minister, with Pandeli Evangjeli being the oldest. So, I need to compare their ages at death and see if this holds true according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n- Row 1 is a header describing each column: name, born-died, term start, term end, political party.\n- Rows 2 to 5 contain data about different prime ministers during the period 1928-1939.\n\nI'll go through each relevant row and extract the necessary information.\n\nStarting with Pandeli Evangjeli (Row 3):\n- Born: 1859\n- Died: 1939\n\nCalculating his age at death: 1939 - 1859 = 80 years old.\n\nNext, Mehdi Bej Frasheri (Row 4):\n- Born: 1872\n- Died: 1963\n\nHis age at death would be: 1963 - 1872 = 91 years old. Wait a minute, that can't be right because he was born in 1872 and died in 1963, which would make him 91, but looking back at the table, his term ended in 1936, and he died later in 1963. However, for this claim, we're focusing on their ages when they died.\n\nWait no, actually, the born-died is given as 1872-1963, so age at death is 91. But looking back, Pandeli Evangjeli was born in 1859 and died in 1939, which makes him 80 years old. So Mehdi Bej Frasheri would be older than Pandeli by 11 years.\n\nHowever, the claim says that Mehdi is the second oldest after Pandeli. That would mean Pandeli is the oldest, and Mehdi comes next. But according to their death ages, Mehdi lived longer (91) compared to Pandeli (80). Therefore, Mehdi should be the oldest, not the second.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check:\n\nPandeli Evangjeli: Born 1859, Died 1939 \u2192 Age at death: 1939 - 1859 = 80 years.\nMehdi Bej Frasheri: Born 1872, Died 1963 \u2192 Age at death: 1963 - 1872 = 91 years.\n\nSo, Mehdi lived longer than Pandeli. Therefore, if we're listing them from oldest to youngest by age at death, Mehdi would be the oldest, and Pandeli would come next. But the claim states that Mehdi is second after Pandeli, which contradicts this because Mehdi actually outlived Pandeli.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because according to the data, Mehdi Bej Frasheri lived longer than Pandeli Evangjeli, making him the oldest among the two, not the second.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Mehdi Bej Frasheri lived longer than Pandeli Evangjeli. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data Points:**\n   - Extract birth and death years for both prime ministers from the table.\n\n2. **Calculate Ages at Death:**\n   - Pandeli Evangjeli: 1939 (death) - 1859 (birth) = 80 years.\n   - Mehdi Bej Frasheri: 1963 (death) - 1872 (birth) = 91 years.\n\n3. **Compare Ages:**\n   - Mehdi (91) > Pandeli (80).\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states Mehdi is second oldest, but he's actually older than Pandeli.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"born - died\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"born - died\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It states that the first prime minister of Albania started their term in 1927. I need to check if this aligns with the information given in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists prime ministers from 1928 to 1939. There are five rows, each detailing a different prime minister's term. The first entry is Kostaq Kota (1st time), whose term started on September 5, 1928. \n\nThe claim mentions the year 1927, which is before the earliest start date in the table. The table doesn't have any data for 1927. Therefore, according to the information provided, there's no prime minister of Albania listed who started their term in 1927.\n\nSince the first recorded term starts in 1928 and there is no mention of a prime minister before that within the table, the claim that the first term began in 1927 isn't supported by the data. \n\nSo, the relevant cells are those that show the start dates for each prime minister's term.

So his term ended in 1935.\n\nLooking at Row 4: Mehdi Bej Frasheri's term was from October 22, 1935, to November 9, 1936. That seems relevant because the claim mentions Kostaq Kota starting on November 9, 1936, which is right after this period.\n\nRow 5 is about Kostaq Kota's second term. It started on November 9, 1936, and ended on April 8, 1939.

The table has rows labeled as Row 1 through Row 5, each with several columns: name, born-died, term start, term end, and political party. \n\nThe claim is about pandeli evangjeli being the only first-time minister in Albania during this period (from 1928 to 1939). So I need to check if pandeli evangjeli was indeed a prime minister for the first time and whether there were any others who served as \"first time\" ministers.\n\nLooking at Row 2: kostaq kota (1st time) - his term starts in 1928 and ends in 1930. So he's a first-time PM.\n\nRow 3: pandeli evangjeli (2nd time). Wait, the claim says he was a first-time minister, but according to this row, it's his second time. That already contradicts the claim because if it's his second term, then he wasn't the \"only\" first-time PM.\n\nRow 4: mehdi bej frash\u00ebri (1st time). His term is from 1935 to 1936. So that's another first-time PM.\n\nRow 5: kostaq kota again, this time his second term. \n\nSo the claim says pandeli evangjelli was the only first-time minister, but in reality, there are at least two others who served as first-time ministers: kostaq kota (first time) and mehdi bej frash\u00ebri.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because pandeli evangjelli wasn't the only first-time prime minister. Additionally, even his own entry says it's his second time, which further invalidates the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
