It's stating that there was a friendly competition held in Shymkent, Kazakhstan, on June 2, 2007.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to see if any of them match all the conditions mentioned in the claim.\n\nStarting with Row 1: The date is March 7, 2007. That doesn't match June 2. So this isn't relevant.\n\nRow 2: Date is June 2, 2007. But let's check other details. Venue is Baku, Azerbaijan, not Shymkent Kazakhstan. Also, the competition type here is \"uefa euro 2008 qualifying,\" which is not a friendly match. So this row doesn't support the claim.\n\nRow 3: Date is August 22, 2007. Doesn't match June 2.\n\nRow 4: September 12, 2007. Again, date doesn't match.\n\nRows 5 to 7: Dates are in 2008 and 2012, so none of these are relevant.\n\nSo the only row with June 2, 2007 is Row 2. But as mentioned earlier, that competition wasn't a friendly; it was part of the UEFA Euro qualifying. Also, the venue was Baku in Azerbaijan, not Shymkent, Kazakhstan.\n\nTherefore, there's no row where all conditions (date, venue, competition type) are satisfied.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the uefa euro 2008 qualify competition that have a score of 1 - 3, be hold in andorra la vella, andorra.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down each part of this claim and check against the table.\n\nSo, looking at the table, there are seven rows. Each row has details about different matches: date, venue, score, result, competition type.\n\nLet's start by identifying which rows involve the \"uefa euro 2008 qualifying\" competition because the claim specifically mentions that. Looking through the rows:\n\n- Row 1 is a friendly match.\n- Row 2 says it's for uefa euro 2008 qualifying.\n- Rows 3,4,5,6,7 are all friendlies except row 2.\n\nSo only row 2 is about the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying. Now, in row 2, let's check the score: it's 1 - 3. The claim mentions a score of 1-3, so that matches.\n\nNext, the venue is Baku, Azerbaijan according to row 2. But the claim says the competition was held in Andorra la Vella, Andorra. That doesn't match because the venue in the table for that specific competition is Baku, not Andorra.\n\nTherefore, even though the competition type and score are correct, the venue stated in the claim isn't accurate according to the table. So the claim has an incorrect venue.\n\nSo putting it all together: the claim correctly identifies the competition (row 2) and the score (1-3), but incorrectly states the venue as Andorra la Vella instead of Baku. Since one part is wrong, the entire claim isn't fully supported by the table. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are row 2's competition, venue, and score to verify each part of the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the uefa duro 2008 qualify competition have a result of lost and be hold august 22  , 2007\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim correctly. It seems like there might be a typo in the competition name. The user wrote \"uefa duro 2008\", but looking at the table, I see a row with \"uefa euro 2008 qualifying\" as the competition. So maybe they meant \"UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying\".\n\nNext, the claim mentions two things: the result was 'lost' and it happened on August 22, 2007.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: Friendly match, date March 7, 2007. Result is a win.\n- Row 2: Date June 2, 2007. Competition is UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying. The result was 'lost' with a score of 1-3.\n- Row 3: Friendly match on August 22, 2007, with a result of win.\n\nWait, the claim says the competition was 'UEFA duro 2008 qualify', but in row 2 it's called 'uefa euro 2008 qualifying'. So there's a discrepancy in the name. However, 'duro' might be a typo for 'euro'.\n\nSo focusing on the correct parts: The claim says the result was lost and held on August 22, 2007.\n\nLooking at August 22, 2007 (Row 3), it's a friendly competition with a result of win. So that doesn't fit because the result is not 'lost'.\n\nThe only row with 'UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying' is Row 2: June 2, 2007, result lost.\n\nSo the claim incorrectly states the date as August 22 instead of June 2 and also mentions the wrong competition name. \n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the actual match for UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying was on June 2, not August 22.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly references the date and competition details. The 'UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying' match resulted in a loss on June 2, not August 22.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_1\": \"june 2 2007\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_1\": \"uefa euro 2008 qualifying\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_1\": \"lost\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
