The columns are: team, sport, played, venue, championships.\n\nThe claim is: \"there be 5 team with no championship , and only 1 with a championship\"\n\nFirst, I'll check the number of teams without any championships.

The claim is comparing two events: one at Reitz Bowl and another at Bosse Field. I need to find out when these venues were used by their respective teams and see if the event at Reitz Bowl happened after the one at Bosse Field.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows with different teams.

So, this event took place in the early 1920s.\n\nNext, looking for Reitz Bowl. Scanning through the venues:\n\nRow 6 mentions Ohio River Bearcats with venue Reitz Bowl, played from 2008-2010. So, their events were much later, around 2008 to 2010.\n\nNow, comparing the years: Bosse Field was used in 1921-1922, and Reitz Bowl was used starting in 2008.

Not relevant here.\n\nRow 2: Evansville Vipers played from 2000-2007 and their venue was Goebel Soccer Complex, but they also have no championships listed.

Not relevant.\n\nRow 4: Evansville Express played from 2004-2005 at Goebel Soccer Complex with no championships. Still not the info we need.\n\nRow 5: Tri-State Titans played football from 2008-2009 at Goebel Soccer Complex. The championships column says \"none.\" So, they didn't win any titles during their active years.\n\nFinally, Row 6: Ohio River Bearcats played from 2008-2010 at Reitz Bowl and won the GMFL title in 2008. This is the key information because it directly mentions winning the championship in question.\n\nThe claim states that the Tri-State Titans are not the team who won the GMFL title in 2008. From the table, Tri-State Titans (Row 5) have no championships listed, whereas Ohio River Bearcats (Row 6) did win that title. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because Tri-State Titans didn't win it; Ohio River Bearcats did.\n\nThe relevant cells here are in Row 5 and Row 6 under the \"championships\" column to check who won the title.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"championships\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"championships\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine whether the claim \"the bosse field be use the most used venue\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the table and the data it contains. The table lists several football teams with their respective details: team name, sport, years played, venue, and championships. \n\nThe claim states that \"bosse field be use the most used venue.\" I think there might be a typo here; it's likely meant to say \"Bosse Field is the most used venue\" or something similar. So, my goal is to verify if Bosse Field was indeed the most frequently used venue among all the teams listed.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Team is evansville crimson giants, venue is bosse field.\n2. **Row 2**: Team is evansville vipers, venue is goebel soccer complex.\n3. **Row 3**: Team is evansville bluecats, venue is roberts municipal stadium.\n4. **Row 4**: Team is evansville express, venue is goebel soccer complex.\n5. **Row 5**: Team is tri-state titans, venue is goebel soccer complex.\n6. **Row 6**: Team is ohio river bearcats, venue is reitz bowl.\n\nNext, I'll count how many times each venue appears:\n\n- Bosse Field: Only in Row 1 (evansville crimson giants).\n- Goebel Soccer Complex: Rows 2, 4, and 5.\n- Roberts Municipal Stadium: Only in Row 3.\n- Reitz Bowl: Only in Row 6.\n\nFrom this count:\n- Bosse Field is used once.\n- Goebel Soccer Complex is used three times, which is more than any other venue.\n- The others are each used once.\n\nThe claim says that Bosse Field is the most used venue.

The claim is asking if events at Robert Municipal Stadium happened before those at Bosse Field.

The claim says: \"ohio river bearcarts be the only team to that do not win a chamionship.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It seems to say that the Ohio River Bearcats are the only team that didn't win any championships.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows of teams with their respective details. Each row has columns: team, sport, played years, venue, and championships.\n\nI should check each team's championships column to see if they have any titles or not.\n\nStarting from Row 1:\n- Evansville Crimson Giants: Championships None.\nRow 2:\n- Evansville Vipers: Championships None.\nRow 3:\n- Evansville Bluecats: Championships None.\nRow 4:\n- Evansville Express: Championships None.\nRow 5:\n- Tri-State Titans: Championships None.\nRow 6:\n- Ohio River Bearcats: Championships GMFL Title 2008.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says Ohio River Bearcats are the only team that didn't win any championships. But according to Row 6, they actually did win a championship in 2008. So the Bearcats have at least one title.\n\nBut then looking back, all other teams except the Bearcats don't have any championships listed. So if the Bearcats are the only ones with a championship, does that mean they are the only ones who won, and others didn't? But the claim is phrased as them being the only team to NOT win.\n\nHmm, so maybe I misread. Let me clarify the claim: \"Ohio River Bearcarts be the only team to that do not win a championship.\" So it's saying they are the only ones who didn't win any championships. But in the table, Rows 1-5 all have championships as none, except Row 6 which has a title.\n\nWait, so actually, Row 6 is the only one with a championship, meaning all other teams (Rows 1-5) did not win any. So the claim would be incorrect because it's saying Ohio River Bearcats didn't win any, but they did. And also, there are multiple teams that didn't win any.\n\nWait no, the claim is about being the only team that didn't win a championship. But in reality, all other teams except Row 6 didn't win any championships, so there are five teams without titles. So the claim would be false because Ohio River Bearcats actually did win one, and others also didn't.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the claim. Let me parse it again: \"Ohio River Bearcarts be the only team to that do not win a chamionship.\" Maybe it's supposed to say they are the only ones who won? But no, that doesn't make sense with the wording.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo in the team name. In the table, it's \"ohio river bearcats\" (with an 'a'), but the claim uses \"bearcarts.\" That might be a mistake. Assuming it's a typo and they meant Bearcats, then checking Row 6 shows they did win a championship.\n\nTherefore, the claim that they are the only team to NOT have won any championships is false because actually, all other teams except them didn't win any, making multiple teams without titles. So the correct answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm: The claim says Ohio River Bearcats are the only ones who didn't win a championship. But according to the table, Rows 1-5 have none in championships, so they didn't win any. Row 6 has one title. Therefore, the Bearcats are the only ones who did win a championship, not those who didn't.\n\nWait, that changes things. If the claim is that they are the only team to NOT win, but in reality, all others also didn't win, then the claim is false because multiple teams didn't win any championships.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Ohio River Bearcats are the only team without a championship. However, checking each row:\n\n- Evansville Crimson Giants: none\n- Evansville Vipers: none\n- Evansville Bluecats: none\n- Evansville Express: none\n- Tri-State Titans: none\n- Ohio River Bearcats: GMFL Title 2008\n\nThus, all teams except the Bearcats did not win any championships. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"championships\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says they did, so I'll look at the \"championships\" column for their row. In Row 2, under championships, it says \"none.\" That means the Vipers didn't win any championships according to the table.\n\nThen, the claim mentions that this happened at Goebel Soccer Complex. Let's check the venue for Evansville Vipers in Row 2. The venue is indeed listed as \"goebel soccer complex.\"\n\nSo putting it together: The Vipers played at Goebel Soccer Complex (relevant), but they didn't win any championships, since their championships entry is \"none.\" Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported because while they were based at that venue, there's no championship mentioned for them. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are the team name in Row 2 and their championships status.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"championships\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
