    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"dicky bond and bruce bannister share the lowest number of goals\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is saying. It states that both Dicky Bond and Bruce Bannister have the same number of goals, which is the lowest among all players listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with their respective statistics: name, goals, apps (appearances), avge (average), and career years. My focus will be on the \"goals\" column to verify this claim.\n\nI'll go through each relevant row:\n\n- **Row 12**: Bruce Bannister has 60 goals.\n- **Row 13**: Dicky Bond also has 60 goals.\n\nNow, I need to check if these are indeed the lowest in the entire table. Let's look at all the players' goal counts:\n\n1. Bobby Campbell: 121\n2. Frank O'Rourke: 88\n3. Dean Windass: 76\n4. John Hallowes: 74\n5. Joe Cooke: 68\n6. Gerry Ingram: 64\n7. Bobby Ham: 64\n8. David McNiven: 64\n9. Sean McCarthy: 63\n10. John Hall: 63\n11. David Jackson: 61\n12. Bruce Bannister: 60\n13. Dicky Bond: 60\n\nFrom this list, the lowest number of goals is 60, achieved by both Bruce Bannister and Dicky Bond. All other players have more than 60 goals.\n\nTherefore, since both have the same number of goals (60), which is lower than all others in the table, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"bobby ham and 2 other athlete have 64 goal.\" So, I need to check how many athletes in the table have exactly 64 goals.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row of the table one by one to see who has 64 goals.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Bobby Campbell has 121 goals. That's way more than 64, so he doesn't count.\nRow 2: Frank O'Rourke scored 88 goals. Still higher than 64, so no match here either.\nRow 3: Dean Windass with 76 goals. Again, above 64. Not relevant.\nRow 4: John Hallows has 74 goals. Also too high. Moving on.\nRow 5: Joe Cooke scored 68 goals. Still higher than 64. Doesn't fit.\nRow 6: Gerry Ingram with 64 goals. Okay, that's the first athlete with exactly 64 goals. So Bobby Ham isn't alone here.\nRow 7: Bobby Ham himself has 64 goals as well. That's the second one mentioned in the claim.\nRow 8: David McNiven scored 64 goals too. Wait, that's a third person with 64 goals. The claim mentions \"2 other athlete,\" which would make it Bobby Ham plus two others\u2014so total three people.\n\nBut let me double-check to ensure I didn't miss anyone else. Let's continue through the rest of the table just in case.\n\nRow 9: Sean McCarthy has 63 goals, which is one less than 64.\nRow 10: John Hall with 63 as well. Still not matching.\nRow 11: David Jackson scored 61 goals. Not relevant.\nRow 12: Bruce Bannister has 60 goals. Also doesn't match.\nRow 13: Dicky Bond with 60 goals. So, beyond this point, no one else has 64.\n\nWait a minute\u2014the claim says Bobby Ham and two others have 64 goals each. But according to the table, it's Bobby Ham (Row7), Gerry Ingram (Row6), and David McNiven (Row8) who all have 64 goals. That makes three athletes in total with 64 goals.\n\nBut the claim specifies \"bobby ham and 2 other athlete,\" which suggests that there should be exactly two others besides Bobby, making it three in total. And indeed, that's what we found: Bobby Ham plus Gerry Ingram and David McNiven. So the claim is accurate because there are two other athletes (Gerry and David) along with Bobby who have 64 goals.\n\nSo putting this together, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Row7 for Bobby Ham under \"goals.\"\n- Row6 for Gerry Ingram under \"goals.\"\n- Row8 for David McNiven under \"goals.\"\n\nEach of these rows has a value of 64 in the \"goals\" column, confirming the claim. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"frank o'rourke's career be 1 year longer than john hallows\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the relevant rows in the table for both players mentioned: frank o'rourke and john hallows.\n\nStarting with Frank O'Rourke:\n- His row index is 1 (since counting starts at 0, so Row 2 is index 1).\n- The career duration is listed as \"1907 - 1914\". To find the number of years he played, I'll subtract 1907 from 1914. That gives me 1914 - 1907 = 7 years.\n\nWait, but sometimes when calculating career spans, we might include both start and end years as full seasons or something. So if someone starts in 1907 and ends in 1914, that's actually 8 years (including both endpoints). Let me double-check:\n- From 1907 to 1914 inclusive is 1914 - 1907 + 1 = 8 years. Hmm, but the table might just list start and end without adding one. Maybe I should consider it as 7 years since 1907 to 1914 is a span of 7 years.\n\nWait, let me think again. If someone starts in 1907 and ends in 1914, how many full seasons or years did they play? For example, if you start in year X and end in year Y, the number of years is Y - X + 1. So 1914 - 1907 = 7, plus 1 is 8. So Frank's career lasted 8 years.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct because sometimes in sports, a season can span two calendar years. But I think for the purpose of this problem, each year represents a single year. Let me confirm by looking at another row.\n\nLooking at Row 4: john hallows has a career from 1930 - 1936. That's 7 years (1936 - 1930 = 6; adding one gives 7). So perhaps the correct way is to subtract and add one. So Frank O'Rourke would be 8 years.\n\nNow, John Hallows:\n- His row index is 3.\n- Career: 1930 - 1936. Using the same calculation: 1936 - 1930 = 6, plus 1 gives 7 years.\n\nSo Frank's career is 8 years and John's is 7 years. The claim says Frank's career was 1 year longer than John's. 8 vs 7 is a difference of 1 year. So the claim should be TRUE.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up any other details. Let me check their respective rows again.\n\nFrank O'Rourke: 1907-1914 = 8 years.\nJohn Hallows: 1930-1936 = 7 years.\nDifference is indeed 1 year, so the claim holds.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE. The relevant cells are Frank's career and John's career, which are in rows 1 and 3 under the 'career' column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Frank O'Rourke's career lasted 8 years (from 1907 to 1914), while John Hallows' career was 7 years (from 1930 to 1936). The difference is exactly one year, making the statement correct.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"career\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"career\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"john hall have the lowest average at 0.15\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two main points:\n1. John Hall has an average (avge) of 0.15.\n2. This average is the lowest among all entries in the table.\n\nTo verify this, I'll need to check both parts against the data provided in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a player with their respective statistics. The relevant columns here are \"name\" and \"avge\". So, for John Hall, I need to find his average and then compare it with all other averages in the table.\n\nStarting with finding John Hall's average:\n- Scanning through the rows, Row 10 has the name \"john hall\".\n- In that row, under the \"avge\" column, it says 0.15. So yes, John Hall's average is indeed 0.15. That checks out.\n\nNext, I need to confirm if this is the lowest average in the table. To do this, I'll go through each player and note their averages:\n\n1. Bobby Campbell: 0.44\n2. Frank O'Rourke: 0.46\n3. Dean Windass: 0.35\n4. John Hallows: 0.45\n5. Joe Cooke: 0.25\n6.

Dicky Bond: 0.2\n\nLooking at all these averages, the lowest one is indeed 0.15, which belongs to John Hall. All other players have higher averages than this.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which column in the table relates to averages. Looking at the headers: name, goals, apps, avge, and career. The \"avge\" column seems to represent the average goals per game or something similar since it has decimal values like 0.44, 0.35, etc.\n\nNext, I'll list out all the \"avge\" values from each row:\n\nRow 1: 0.44  \nRow 2: 0.46  \nRow 3: 0.35  \nRow 4: 0.45  \nRow 5: 0.25  \nRow 6: 0.37  \nRow 7: 0.34  \nRow 8: 0.3  \nRow 9: 0.48  \nRow 10: 0.15  \nRow 11: 0.24  \nRow 12: 0.29  \n\nNow, I need to find the highest and lowest averages from this list.\n\nLooking through them:\n- The highest \"avge\" is 0.48 in Row 9.\n- The lowest \"avge\" is 0.15 in Row 10.\n\nThe claim says that the difference between the highest and lowest average should be 0.33. So, let's calculate the actual difference:\n\nHighest - Lowest = 0.48 - 0.15 = 0.33\n\nWait, exactly 0.33! That matches the claim perfectly.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are Row 9 (highest average) and Row 10 (lowest average).

The user is stating that exactly one person in the table has 64 goals. So my task is to check how many individuals in the table have a 'goals' value of 64.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different player with their respective stats. The columns we're concerned with here are the 'name' and 'goals'. \n\nI'll start by scanning through each row's 'goals' column to count how many times 64 appears.\n\nRow 1: bobby campbell has 121 goals \u2013 not 64.\nRow 2: frank o'rourke has 88 goals \u2013 nope.\nRow 3: dean windass has 76 goals \u2013 still not 64.\nRow 4: john hallows has 74 goals \u2013 moving on.\nRow 5: joe cooke scored 68 \u2013 close but not quite.\nRow 6: gerry ingram has 64 goals \u2013 that's one.\nRow 7: bobby ham also has 64 goals \u2013 another one.\nRow 8: david mcniven has 64 as well \u2013 now three.\nRows 9 through 13 don't have 64 in the 'goals' column.\n\nSo, I found that Gerry Ingram (row 6), Bobby Ham (row 7), and David McNiven (row 8) all have 64 goals each.

So, my task is to check each player's goals and see if David Jackson indeed has the lowest number.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 13 rows, each representing a different player with their respective stats. The relevant column here is \"goals.\" I'll go through each row and note down the number of goals each player has.\n\nStarting from Row 1: Bobby Campbell has 121 goals.\nRow 2: Frank O'Rourke has 88 goals.\nRow 3: Dean Windass has 76 goals.\nRow 4: John Hallows has 74 goals.\nRow 5: Joe Cooke has 68 goals.\nRow 6: Gerry Ingram has 64 goals.\nRow 7: Bobby Ham also has 64 goals.\nRow 8: David McNiven has 64 goals as well.\nRow 9: Sean McCarthy has 63 goals.\nRow 10: John Hall has 63 goals too.\nRow 11: David Jackson has 61 goals.\nRow 12: Bruce Bannister has 60 goals.\nRow 13: Dicky Bond also has 60 goals.\n\nNow, compiling the goal numbers: The highest is 121 (Bobby Campbell), and looking for the lowest.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify who John Hallow is in the table. Looking at the rows, I see Row 4 has the name \"john hallows\". Wait, that's slightly different\u2014maybe a typo? The claim says \"john hallow\", but the table lists it as \"john hallows\". That could be a mistake on my part or perhaps a typo in the data.\n\nAssuming it's the same person, let me check his career span. His career is listed as \"1930 - 1936\". So that's from 1930 to 1936. Let me calculate how many years that is. From 1930 to 1936 inclusive is 7 years. But wait, sometimes when calculating the number of seasons or actual playing time, people might count each year as a separate season even if it's just part of a year.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider each dash as a range and calculate the duration. From 1930 to 1936 is a span of 6 years (since 1936 - 1930 = 6). Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me recount: 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936\u2014that's 7 years total.\n\nThe claim is whether he played for more than 10 years. If it's 7 years, that's less than 10, so the answer would be false. But I should make sure there aren't any other periods in his career listed elsewhere.\n\nLooking again at Row 4: \"john hallows\" has a career from 1930 - 1936. There are no additional ranges mentioned for him. So his entire career is within those six years, which adds up to seven years when including both start and end years.\n\nTherefore, since he played for only 7 years, the claim that he played more than 10 years is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that John Hallow played for more than 10 years.

So, I need to look at all the values in the 'avge' column across all rows and find the maximum and minimum values.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: avge = 0.44\nRow 2: avge = 0.46\nRow 3: avge = 0.35\nRow 4: avge = 0.45\nRow 5: avge = 0.25\nRow 6: avge = 0.37\nRow 7: avge = 0.34\nRow 8: avge = 0.3\nRow 9: avge = 0.48\nRow 10: avge = 0.15\nRow 11: avge = 0.24\nRow 12: avge = 0.29\n\nNow, let me list all the 'avge' values:\n\n0.44, 0.46, 0.35, 0.45, 0.25, 0.37, 0.34, 0.3, 0.48, 0.15, 0.24, 0.29.\n\nI need to find the highest and lowest averages here.\n\nLooking for the highest: It looks like row 9 has avge=0.48, which is higher than the others. The next one is row 2 with 0.46, then row 1 with 0.44, so yes, 0.48 is the maximum.\n\nFor the lowest average, I see row 10 has avge=0.15. Let me check if any other rows have lower than that. Row 8 is 0.3, which is higher. Others are above or equal to 0.25 except row 10. So, the minimum is 0.15.\n\nNow, calculate the difference between these two: 0.48 (max) - 0.15 (min) = 0.33.\n\nThe claim says there's less than a 2 difference. Since 0.33 is much less than 2, the claim holds true.\n\nWait, but I should make sure if \"difference\" here refers to absolute difference or something else. But in this context, it likely means the numerical subtraction of max minus min, which is what I did.\n\nSo, all relevant cells are those with avge values, especially row 9 and row 10 because they have the highest and lowest averages respectively.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the difference between the highest and lowest average goals per appearance (avge) is less than 2. By examining the 'avge' column, the maximum value is 0.48 (row 9) and the minimum is 0.15 (row 10). The difference is 0.33, which is indeed less than 2.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"avge\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"avge\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
