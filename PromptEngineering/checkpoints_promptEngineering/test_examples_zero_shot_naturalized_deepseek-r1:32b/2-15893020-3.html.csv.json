    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me figure this out step by step. The user is asking whether the claim \"average be 0.1 for deon kruis\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table rows to find Deon Kruis. Scanning the player names, I see that Row 17 is about Deon Kruis. So that's where I need to check his average.\n\nLooking at the columns in Row 17: matches (2), innings (1), not out (1), runs (3), high score (3), and then the average column. The table shows \"average: n / a\" for Deon Kruis. Hmm, that stands out because \"n/a\" usually means the data isn't available or applicable.\n\nThe claim says his average is 0.1. But according to the table, it's not listed; instead, it's marked as n/a. That suggests there might be an issue calculating his average, maybe due to insufficient innings or other reasons.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check how averages are calculated in cricket. Batting average is typically runs scored divided by the number of times out (innings minus not outs). For Deon Kruis, he has 1 innings and was not out once. So, since he hasn't been dismissed, his average can't be calculated because there's no dismissal to divide by. That explains why it's n/a.\n\nSo the claim states an average of 0.1, but according to the table, Deon Kruis doesn't have a recorded average\u2014it's not applicable or maybe zero if considering only dismissals. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because his average isn't listed as 0.1 in the table; it's either n/a or undefined.\n\nI need to make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. If someone claims an average of 0.1 but the data shows n/a, then the claim can't be supported. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"average\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
