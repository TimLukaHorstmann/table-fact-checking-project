In Row 1, under 'school', it says \"shanley high school\" which is in Fargo, North Dakota. However, the column we're interested in is 'college'. According to the table, Connor McGovern's college is listed as \"missouri\".\n\nSince the claim states that Connor went to college in Missouri and the table confirms this under the 'college' column of Row 1, the claim is supported.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, with the relevant cell being row 0 (assuming rows are zero-indexed) and the column name 'college'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim again: \"Kevin McReynolds go to college at UCLA and his hometown be Washington, DC.\" I notice there might be a typo in \"go\" which should probably be \"went\" for past tense, but I think that's just a minor mistake. The main points are about his college and hometown.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has multiple rows, each representing a player with details like position, school, hometown, and college. My task is to find the row where the player is Kevin McReynolds and then check the relevant columns for his college and hometown.\n\nLet me scan through each row:\n\nRow 1: Connor McGovern \u2013 not him.\nRow 2: Kevin McReynolds \u2013 that's the one I need. Now, let's see the details in this row.\n\nIn Row 2, the columns are:\n- player: Kevin McReynolds\n- position: defensive line\n- school: St John's high school\n- hometown: Washington, DC\n- college: UCLA\n\nSo according to the table, Kevin McReynolds attended UCLA for college and his hometown is Washington, DC. That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nI should also make sure there are no other rows mentioning Kevin McReynolds in case of duplicates, but scanning through Rows 1 to 12, I don't see any other entries with that name. Therefore, Row 2 is the only relevant one here.\n\nTo confirm, the college he attended is UCLA, which aligns with the claim, and his hometown is Washington, DC, which also matches. Since both parts of the claim are accurate based on the table data, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately states that Kevin McReynolds attended UCLA and is from Washington, DC.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"hometown\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim. It's about a player named Trey Depriest and his position being a linebacker. The task is to check if this information matches what's in the table.\n\nI remember that each row in the table represents a different player with various details like their position, school, hometown, and college. So I need to find the row where the player is Trey Depriest.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nRow 1: Connor McGovern\nRow 2: Kevin McReynolds\nRow 3: Jesse Hayes\nRow 4: Kris Harley\nRow 5: Trey Depriest\n\nAh, here we go. Row 5 is about Trey Depriest. Now, let's check his position.\n\nThe columns are player, position, school, hometown, college. So for row 5, the position is listed as \"linebacker.\" That matches exactly with what the claim states.\n\nSo the claim says Trey Depriest plays linebacker, and according to the table, that's correct. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: I need to list which cells were checked. For this case, it's row 5 for both player name and position.

I need to determine whether the claim \"Connor McGovern goes to St John's High School\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the table carefully to find information about Connor McGovern and St John's High School. The table has 12 rows, each representing a different player with details like position, school, hometown, etc.\n\nLooking at Row 1: The player is Connor McGovern. His school is listed as Shanley High School. So, according to this row, Connor attended Shanley High School in Fargo, North Dakota, and he's going to the University of Missouri for college.\n\nNext, I'll check if any other players attend St John's High School. Scanning through the rows, I notice that Row 2 mentions Kevin McReynolds from St John's High School. So, Kevin is the one who goes to St John's.\n\nThe claim states that Connor McGovern attends St John's High School. From the table, this isn't true because Connor's school is Shanley, not St John's. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nTo support my conclusion, I'll note the relevant cells from the table. For Connor McGovern, the school is in Row 1 under the \"school\" column.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"jabriel washington play defensive line for alabama\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by breaking down the claim into its components.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two main pieces of information: the player's name (Jabriel Washington) and his position (defensive line), as well as the college he plays for (Alabama). I need to check each of these against the table to see if they align correctly.\n\nLooking at the table, it has multiple rows, each representing a different player. I'll go through each row to find where Jabriel Washington is listed. Scanning through the players' names: Row 10 mentions Karlos Williams, Row 11 Doran Grant, and Row 12 Jabriel Washington. Okay, so he's in Row 12.\n\nNow, let me check the relevant details for Jabriel Washington from Row 12. The columns are player, position, school, hometown, and college. \n\n- Player: Jabriel Washington \u2013 matches the claim.\n- Position: defensive back \u2013 wait a minute, the claim says he plays defensive line, but here it's listed as defensive back. That seems contradictory.\n- College: alabama \u2013 this part does match.\n\nSo, while the player's name and college are correct, his position is different. The claim states he plays defensive line, but according to the table, his position is defensive back. \n\nTherefore, since one of the key pieces of information (position) doesn't align with what's in the table, the entire claim isn't fully supported. It's partially true but not entirely accurate because of the position discrepancy.\n\nI should also note which cells were relevant for checking this claim. The player's name is obviously crucial, so that's Row 12, column 'player'. Then, his position and college are both important aspects of the claim, so those would be Row 12, columns 'position' and 'college'.\n\nPutting it all together, since the position doesn't match, the claim isn't TRUE. It should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Jabriel Washington plays defensive line for Alabama. Checking the table:\n\n- Jabriel Washington is listed in Row 12.\n- His position is \"defensive back,\" not \"defensive line.\"\n- He attends Alabama.\n\nSince his position doesn't match, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
