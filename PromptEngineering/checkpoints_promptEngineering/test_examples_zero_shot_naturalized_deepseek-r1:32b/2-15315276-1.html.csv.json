Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the year 2012 in the table. Scanning through each row, Row 2 has the year 2012. So that's where I should focus my attention.\n\nNext, I need to check two things: who was the champion that year and their country. The claim states the champion was from the United States. Looking at Row 2, under the \"champion\" column, it says Jenny Gleason. Then, in the \"country\" column for that same row, it's listed as the United States.\n\nSo both the champion and their country match the claim. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nNow, to structure this into a JSON object with the answer and relevant cells. The answer should be TRUE since the information from the table confirms the claim. The relevant cells are in Row 2 for the \"champion\" and \"country\" columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the specific details in the table for the year 2012, confirming both the champion and their country.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"jessica shepley receive a winner 's share of 14000 when she win the beaver meadow golf course tournament.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down what needs to be verified here.\n\n1. **Identify Jessica Shepley in the Table**: I should look through each row to find if there's an entry where the champion is Jessica Shepley.\n\nLooking at Row 3: The champion is listed as jessica shepley. So that's a match.\n\n2. **Check the Tournament Location**: The claim mentions \"beaver meadow golf course.\" I need to confirm that the location for her win was indeed there.\n\nIn Row 3, under tournament location, it's \"beaver meadow golf course,\" which matches the claim.\n\n3. **Verify the Winner's Share Amount**: The claim states she received a winner's share of $14,000. Let's check that in the table.\n\nLooking at Row 3 again, the winner's share is listed as 14000. That aligns with the claim.\n\nSo all parts of the claim are supported by the data in Row 3: the champion's name, the tournament location, and the exact amount of the winner's share.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Jessica Shepley won at Beaver Meadow Golf Course in 2011 with a winner's share of $14,000.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"tournament location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"after 2012 the winner's share be never less than 15000\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that after the year 2012, the winner's share in each subsequent tournament was not less than $15,000. So, I need to check all entries in the table where the year is greater than 2012 and see if any of those have a winner's share below $15,000.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 10 rows, each representing a different year from 2004 to 2013. The claim is about years after 2012, so I'm interested in the years 2013 and beyond. In this case, the only year after 2012 in the table is 2013.\n\nNext, I need to examine the winner's share for each of these relevant years. For the row corresponding to 2013 (Row 1), the winner's share is listed as $15,000. That meets the condition of being at least $15,000. \n\nHowever, it's also important to check if there are any other rows after 2013. Since the table only goes up to 2013, I don't have data beyond that year. But based on the information provided, all entries from 2013 onward (which is just one entry) do not have a winner's share less than $15,000.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true with the given data because there are no instances after 2012 where the winner's share was below $15,000. The only applicable row for this condition is Row 1, and it supports the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as all years after 2012 in the table have a winner's share of at least $15,000.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"champion jenny shin share 14000 dollar when she win\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It mentions two main points: the champion is Jenny Shin and her winner's share was $14,000. \n\nI should look through each row in the table to find any entry where the champion is Jenny Shin. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 2: Champion is Jenny Gleason.\n- Row 4: Champion is Jenny Shin.\n\nSo, Row 4 corresponds to Jenny Shin's win. Now, I need to check the \"winner's share\" for that row. The winner's share in Row 4 is listed as $15,400.\n\nThe claim states that her share was $14,000, but according to the table, it's $15,400. Therefore, the claim is not accurate. \n\nI should also check if there are any other entries for Jenny Shin in case I missed one, but from the table provided, Row 4 is the only entry with her name as champion.\n\nSo, the relevant cell is Row 4's \"winner 's share\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Jenny Shin received a $14,000 share, but according to the data, she won $15,400. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "there be zero purse after 2012 that have a winner 's share of less than 15400",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with tournament data from different years, and a claim to verify: \"there be zero purse after 2012 that have a winner's share of less than 15400.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the claim is saying that after 2012, there are no purses where the winner's share was less than $15,400. Wait, actually, I think it might be misphrased. The wording says \"zero purse after 2012,\" but maybe they mean zero tournaments (rows) after 2012 with a winner's share under that amount.\n\nLooking at the table, the years go from 2004 to 2013. So after 2012 would be 2013 and any later years if present. In this case, only 2013 is there.\n\nLet me check each row:\n\n- Row 1: Year 2013, winner's share is $15,000.\n- Rows after 2012 are just 2013 and the others before that. Wait no, 2013 is the only year after 2012.\n\nSo I need to see if in 2013, the winner's share was less than $15,400. The row shows it as $15,000, which is indeed less than $15,400. So that means there exists at least one purse (the 2013 tournament) after 2012 where the winner's share was under $15,400.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"zero\" such purses. Since 2013 is a case where it happened, the claim would be false.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check other years just in case I misunderstood. The claim specifically mentions after 2012, so only 2013 and beyond. In this table, only 2013 is there post-2012. So yeah, since 2013's winner's share was $15k, which is less than $15,4k, the claim that zero purses after 2012 had shares under 15,4k is false.\n\nSo I should mark this as FALSE and list the relevant cells. The relevant cell would be the 2013 row's winner's share.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there are no tournaments after 2012 with a winner's share below $15,400. However, the 2013 tournament shows a share of $15,000, which is less than $15,400.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winner's share\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
