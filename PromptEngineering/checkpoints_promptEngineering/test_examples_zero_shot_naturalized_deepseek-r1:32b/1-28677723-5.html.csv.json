    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table with several rows and columns, each containing information about different dance couples, their styles, music, and scores from various judges. They've also given a specific claim that needs to be evaluated against the table.\n\nThe claim is: \"stig alexandra be a couple whose music be murder on the dance floor.\" My goal is to determine whether this statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the information in the table provided.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The key elements here are:\n1. A couple named \"stig alexandra.\"\n2. Their music being \"murder on the dance floor.\"\n\nI need to check if these two pieces of information correspond correctly in the table.\n\nLooking at the table rows, each row represents a different couple with their respective details. I'll go through each row one by one to find any mention of \"stig alexandra\" and see what music is associated with them.\n\nStarting with Row 1: The couple listed here is \"stig & alexandra.\" That seems like the same couple as mentioned in the claim, just written slightly differently (with an ampersand instead of \"alexandra\"). So this row is likely referring to the same individuals. \n\nNext, I'll check the music column for this row. It says: \"murder on the dance floor - sophie ellis  - bextor.\" The music piece mentioned in the claim is \"murder on the dance floor,\" which matches exactly with the first part of the entry here.\n\nNow, to ensure accuracy, I'll quickly scan through the other rows to see if there's any other mention of \"stig alexandra\" or similar names. From a quick glance, Row 1 seems to be the only one that mentions both \"stig\" and \"alexandra\" as a couple. Other rows have different names like Tommy & Rakel, Asleik & Nadia, Maria & Asmund, etc.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis:\n- The couple's name matches (Row 1: stig & alexandra).\n- Their music is indeed \"murder on the dance floor\" as per the claim.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied according to Row 1 of the table, the claim appears to be TRUE. There's no conflicting information in other rows that would suggest otherwise, so I can confidently conclude that the claim is supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"couple\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"music\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"\u00e5sleik nadia be a couple and their style be the english waltz\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It states that there's a couple named \u00e5sleik and Nadia, and their dance style is English Waltz. So I need to check two things in the table: if such a couple exists and whether their style matches.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 1: Couple is Stig & Alexandra\nRow 2: Tommy & Rakel\nRow 3: \u00c5sleik & Nadia \u2013 okay, that's the couple mentioned. Their style here is English Waltz.\nRow 4: Maria & Asmund\nRow 5: Anne-Marie & Glenn\nRow 6: Stine & Tom-Erik\nRow 7: Cecilie & Tobias\nRow 8: Cato & Marianne\nRow 9: H\u00e5vard & Elena\n\nSo, in row 3, the couple is indeed \u00c5sleik & Nadia. Their style is English Waltz as per the claim. \n\nWait a second, does their name exactly match? The claim says \"\u00e5sleik nadia\" without any spaces or capitalization. In the table, it's written as \"\u00e5sleik  & nadia\". So the names are present and correctly matched.\n\nNow, checking if there's another row with this couple elsewhere, but looking through all rows, I don't see any other occurrence of \u00c5sleik and Nadia. \n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the table: they are a couple listed in row 3, and their style is English Waltz. So the answer should be TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells here are the \"couple\" column for row 3, which confirms their names, and the \"style\" column for the same row to confirm it's English Waltz.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"couple\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"style\"}\n   ]\n}",

It mentions that Cecilia and Tobias are a couple (though in the table it's written as cecilie & tobias), and their music is by The Pussycat Dolls.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- Row 7: Couple is cecilie & tobias, style is cha-cha-cha, and the music is listed as \"perhaps , perhaps , perhaps - the pussycat dolls\". So, yes, the music here is by The Pussycat Dolls.\n\nSo, both parts of the claim are correct: they're a couple in row 7, and their song is indeed by The Pussycat Dolls.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table with several rows of data about different dance couples and their performances. They want me to determine if a specific claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information in the table.\n\nThe claim is: \"cato marianne be a couple whose style be the english waltz and their music be you light up my life whitney houston.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is referring to. The claim mentions three pieces of information:\n1. The couple's name: cato marianne\n2. Their dance style: english waltz\n3. Their music: you light up my life by whitney houston\n\nI should check each of these against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 9 rows (indexed from 0 to 8). Each row contains information about a couple, their dance style, the music they used, and scores from four judges. The total score is also given for each couple.\n\nStarting with the first part of the claim: \"cato marianne be a couple.\" I need to find if there's a row where the couple is listed as cato & marianne. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: stig & alexandra\n- Row 1: tommy & rakel\n- Row 2: \u00e5sleik & nadia\n- Row 3: maria & asmund\n- Row 4: anne - marie & glenn\n- Row 5: stine & tom - erik\n- Row 6: cecilie & tobias\n- Row 7: cato & marianne\n- Row 8: h\u00e5vard & elena\n\nSo, the couple \"cato & marianne\" is in row 7. That's a match for the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, checking their style. The claim says it should be \"english waltz.\" Looking at row 7 under the \"style\" column: yes, it's listed as english waltz. So that matches too.\n\nNow, onto the music. The claim mentions \"you light up my life - whitney houston.\" Checking the \"music\" column for row 7: it says \"you light up my life - whitney houston.\" That's an exact match.\n\nSince all three pieces of information in the claim are accurately reflected in row 7 of the table, the claim is TRUE. \n\nI should also note which cells were relevant to this verification. The couple's name is under the \"couple\" column, style under \"style,\" and music under \"music.\" So, for row 7, I need to reference these three columns.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n- Relevant cells are from row 7: \"couple,\" \"style,\" and \"music.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the answer is TRUE with those relevant cells specified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"couple\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"style\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"music\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"stine tom-erik have a trine dehli cleve of 8 and have music by louis armstrong.\"\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each part of the claim is referring to. \n\n1. **Identifying the Couple**: The first part mentions \"stine tom-erik.\" Looking at the table, I need to find a row where the couple's name matches this. Scanning through the rows, Row 6 has the couple listed as \"stine & tom - erik.\" This seems like a match.\n\n2. **Checking Trine Dehli Cleve Score**: The claim says they have a trine dehli cleve of 8. In the table, each row lists scores under different judges: Trine Dehli Cleve, Tor Fl\u00f8ysvik, Karianne Gulliksen, and Christer Tornell. For Row 6, the score under Trine Dehli Cleve is indeed 8. So this part checks out.\n\n3. **Verifying the Music Artist**: The claim also mentions that they have music by Louis Armstrong. Looking at the 'music' column for Row 6, it's listed as \"what a wonderful world - louis armstrong.\" This directly matches the claim about the music being by Louis Armstrong.\n\nNow, I need to ensure that all parts of the claim are supported by the table. The couple name matches, their Trine Dehli Cleve score is correct, and the music artist is accurately stated. There's no conflicting information in the row. Therefore, both conditions in the claim are satisfied based on Row 6.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other rows that might have similar or conflicting information. Looking through all nine rows, I don't find another couple with a Trine Dehli Cleve score of 8 and music by Louis Armstrong. Thus, the claim is fully supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately reflects the data in Row 6 where Stine & Tom-Erik have a Trine Dehli Cleve score of 8 and their music is by Louis Armstrong.\n\n**Answer:**  \n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"couple\"},\n     {\"row_6\", \"trine dehli cleve\"},\n     {\"row_6\", \"music\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nWait, I think there's a mistake in the formatting. Let me correct that.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row index 5 (since rows are 0-indexed, so row 6 is index 5) for the couple name.\n- Same row for Trine Dehli Cleve score and music artist.\n\n**Correct Answer:**  \n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"couple\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"trine dehli cleve\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"music\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nWait, in the initial table description, rows are labeled from 1 to 9. But in JSON, arrays are 0-indexed. So Row 6 is actually index 5.\n\nBut looking back, in the problem statement, each row is presented as Row 1, Row 2, etc., so in the context of this question, it's better to refer to them by their given row numbers (1-9) rather than converting to zero-based index. So Row 6 would be row_index:5 if using zero-based, but maybe we should use row_index starting at 1.\n\nWait no, actually, in the example provided, they used \"row_0\" for the first row. So yes, it's zero-indexed. Therefore, Row 6 is index 5.\n\nBut let me check again:\n\nRow 1: couple stig & alexandra\n...\nRow 6: couple stine & tom-erik\n\nSo in terms of array indices, that would be index 0 to 8 for rows 1 to 9. Therefore, Row 6 is at index 5.\n\nBut perhaps the system expects row indexes as per their presentation (starting from 1). To avoid confusion, I'll adjust accordingly.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_0\": 5, \"column_name\": \"couple\"},\n     {\"row_0\":5, \"column_name\": \"trine dehli cleve\"},\n     {\"row_0\":5, \"column_name\": \"music\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nWait no, the keys should be row_index as integers. So:\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"couple\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"trine dehli cleve\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"music\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nBut I think the system expects row indexes starting at 1. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to refer as per their original numbering.\n\nGiven the problem statement uses Row 1, Row 2, etc., but in JSON arrays are zero-based, so for consistency with programming standards, I'll use zero-based indexing.\n\nHowever, the exact mapping wasn't provided, so perhaps using row indexes starting at 0 is correct. So:\n\nRow 1: index 0\n...\nRow 6: index 5\n\nSo the relevant cells are in row index 5.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"couple\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"trine dehli cleve\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"music\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nBut looking back at the initial problem statement's example:\n\n\"You are tasked with... For example...\"\n\nWait no, perhaps I should use row numbers as per their presentation. So Row 6 is considered row index 6 if using 1-based.\n\nWait, no, in programming, arrays are zero-indexed. To avoid confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to map the first row (Row 1) to index 0, so Row 6 would be index 5.\n\nThus:\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"couple\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"trine dehli cleve\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"music\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nBut perhaps the question expects row indexes starting at 1. To reconcile this, I'll list all rows from 0 to 8.\n\nIn any case, for clarity:\n\nThe correct cells are in Row 6 (original numbering), which is index 5 if zero-based.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"couple\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"trine dehli cleve\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"music\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nBut to be precise and avoid confusion, perhaps the correct row index is 6 if considering rows as 1-based.\n\nWait, in the problem statement's example response, they used:\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"couple\"},\n     ...\n   ]\n}\n\nWhich suggests that Row 1 is row_index:0. So yes, for consistency, I'll proceed with zero-based indexing.\n\n**Final Correct Answer:**\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\":\"couple\"},\n     {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\":\"trine dehli cleve\"},\n     {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\":\"music\"}\n   ]\n}\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in Row 6 of the table. The couple's name matches, their Trine Dehli Cleve score is correct, and the music artist is accurately stated.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Couple**: Locate \"stine & tom - erik\" in the 'couple' column, found in Row 6 (row index 5).\n\n2. **Trine Dehli Cleve Score**: Verify that the score under Trine Dehli Cleve is 8, which it is in this row.\n\n3. **Music Artist Check**: Confirm that the music entry includes \"louis armstrong,\" as stated in the claim.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\":\"couple\"},\n     {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\":\"trine dehli cleve\"},\n     {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\":\"music\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has several rows, each representing a couple with their respective details. The columns include \"couple\", \"style\", \"music\", and then individual scores from different judges followed by a total score. \n\nThe claim mentions two specific pieces of information: the dance style is cha-cha-cha, and the music is \"you light up my life\" by Whitney Houston. So I need to check if both these conditions are true for Stig & Alexandra.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Couple is stig & alexandra. Their style is indeed cha-cha-cha. Now, what about the music? The music listed here is \"murder on the dance floor - sophie ellis bextor\". That doesn't match the claim's music at all.\n\nI should check other rows to see if any mention Whitney Houston or \"you light up my life\". Scanning through:\n\nRow 8: Couple is cato & marianne, style is english waltz. The music here is \"you light up my life - whitney houston\". But wait, their dance style isn't cha-cha-cha; it's english waltz.\n\nSo Stig & Alexandra have the correct dance style but wrong music. Cato & Marianne have the correct music but wrong dance style. Therefore, no couple in the table combines both the cha-cha-cha style with Whitney Houston's \"you light up my life\".\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because there's no row where Stig & Alexandra are dancing to that specific song.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Stig & Alexandra will perform a cha-cha-cha dance to \"You Light Up My Life\" by Whitney Houston. Checking the table:\n\n- Stig & Alexandra (Row 1) perform cha-cha-cha but their music is different.\n- The correct music appears in Row 8 with Cato & Marianne, but they don't dance cha-cha-cha.\n\nHence, no couple matches both criteria.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"couple\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"style\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"music\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"maria & asmund be the couple who will be dance to music by the pussycat doll.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this claim. It says that Maria and Asmund are dancing to a song by The Pussycat Dolls. So I need to check two things in the table: whether Maria & Asmund's music is indeed by The Pussycat Dolls and if they have any connection with them.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a couple along with details like style of dance, music, scores from judges, etc. I'll go through each relevant part step by step.\n\nI know that Maria & Asmund are in Row 4. Let me check their entry:\n\n- Couple: maria & asmund\n- Style: cha-cha-cha\n- Music: tik tok - keha\n\nSo the music for them is \"tik tok\" performed by Keha, not The Pussycat Dolls.\n\nNow, I should also check which couple danced to a song by The Pussycat Dolls. Let's scan through each row:\n\nRow 1: Murder on the dance floor - Sophie Ellis-Bextor\nRow 2: 4 minutes - Madonna & Justin Timberlake\nRow 3: Six ribbons - Jon English\nRow 4: tik tok - Keha (Maria & Asmund)\nRow 5: Bojangles - The Rat Pack\nRow 6: What a wonderful world - Louis Armstrong\nRow 7: Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps - The Pussycat Dolls. Couple is Cecilie & Tobias.\nRow 8: You light up my life - Whitney Houston\nRow 9: I wonder why - Curtis Stigers\n\nSo, the only couple dancing to music by The Pussycat Dolls is Cecilie & Tobias in Row 7.\n\nTherefore, Maria & Asmund are not dancing to a song by The Pussycat Dolls.

Let's go through each row one by one.\n\n- Row 1: Couple is Stig & Alexandra. Style is cha-cha-cha, music is Murder on the Dance Floor by Sophie Ellis-Bextor. Not the couple in question.\n- Row 2: Tommy & Rakel. Style is cha-cha-cha, but they're dancing to \"4 Minutes\" by Madonna and Justin Timberlake. Still not our target.\n- Row 3: \u00c5sleik & Nadia. Their style is listed as English Waltz, and the music is Six Ribbons by Jon English. Hmm, so this couple does exist in the table, but their dance style isn't cha-cha-cha, and the song isn't Tik Tok by Keha.\n  \nWait a second, I should check if there's another row where the style is cha-cha-cha and the music is Tik Tok. Let me continue checking.\n\n- Row 4: Maria & Asmund. Style is cha-cha-cha, music is Tik Tok by Keha. So this couple has both the correct dance style and song.\n- Rows 5 to 9 don't have the name \u00c5sleik & Nadia again, so they must be in row 3.\n\nSo according to the table:\n\n- \u00c5sleik & Nadia's dance style is English Waltz, not cha-cha-cha.\n- They're dancing to Six Ribbons by Jon English, not Tik Tok by Keha.\n\nTherefore, the claim that they will dance cha-cha-cha to Tik Tok is incorrect. The relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 3 for \u00c5sleik & Nadia's style and music.\n- Row 4 for the correct couple (Maria & Asmund) who have the style and song mentioned in the claim.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because the details don't match for the specific couple mentioned.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"\u00e5sleik & nadia\" will dance to cha-cha-cha with \"tik tok - keha\". Checking row 3 shows they danced English Waltz to a different song. The correct entry is in row 4.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"style\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"music\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"cato  & alexandra be a couple whose style be the english waltz and their music be by curtis stigers.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. **Couple Name**: Cato & Alexandra\n2. **Style**: English Waltz\n3. **Music Artist**: Curtis Stigers\n\nNow, I'll check each of these against the table.\n\n**Step 1: Looking for \"Cato & Alexandra\"**\n\nI scan through all rows to find a couple named Cato & Alexandra. Let's look at each row:\n\n- Row 1: Stig & Alexandra\n- Row 2: Tommy & Rakel\n- Row 3: \u00c5sleik & Nadia\n- Row 4: Maria & Asmund\n- Row 5: Anne-Marie & Glenn\n- Row 6: Stine & Tom-Erik\n- Row 7: Cecilie & Tobias\n- Row 8: Cato & Marianne\n- Row 9: H\u00e5vard & Elena\n\nI notice that in Row 8, the couple is \"Cato & Marianne,\" not \"Cato & Alexandra.\" So there's no row where both names are Cato and Alexandra together.\n\n**Step 2: Checking for English Waltz Style**\n\nEven if I consider each name separately, let me check their styles:\n\n- For Cato: Row 8 shows style as English Waltz.\n- For Alexandra: Looking back, in Row 1, she's part of the couple Stig & Alexandra with style Cha-Cha-Cha.\n\nSo individually, Cato has the English Waltz, but Alexandra is paired with Cha-Cha-Cha. Therefore, together, their styles differ.\n\n**Step 3: Music by Curtis Stigers**\n\nLooking at the music column:\n\n- In Row 9: The couple H\u00e5vard & Elena uses \"I wonder why\" by Curtis Stigers. But that's a different couple.\n\nSo, there's no row where both Cato and Alexandra are dancing to Curtis Stigers' music. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSince the couple \"Cato & Alexandra\" doesn't exist in the table as per the given rows, the claim isn't supported. Therefore, the answer is FALSE. The relevant cells checked include all entries for Cato and Alexandra across different columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"couple\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"couple\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"stine & tom-erik dance to what a wonderful world - louis armstrong and be give a score of 6 by trine dehli cleve.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for the couple \"stine & tom-erik\" in the table. Scanning through each row, I find that Row 6 is their entry.\n\nNext, checking the music they danced to: The claim says it's \"what a wonderful world - louis armstrong.\" Looking at Row 6 under the 'music' column, it indeed matches exactly. So that part checks out.\n\nNow, regarding the score given by Trine Dehli Cleve. The claim states she gave them a 6. In Row 6, the score for Trine Dehli Cleve is listed as 8. That's different from what the claim says, which means this part isn't correct.\n\nSince one of the conditions in the claim doesn't match the table data, the overall statement isn't fully supported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"couple\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"music\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"trine dehli cleve\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
