Checking if Bennie Oosterbaan Mike Tully plays the end position.\nLooking at Row 1: The position is listed as \"ends,\" and the names are \"bennie oosterbaan mike tully.\" So, both of them are in the ends position. That seems correct.\n\n2. Next, checking if Ed Weir Ralph Chase play the tackle position.\nLooking at Row 2: The position here is \"tackles,\" and the names are \"ed weir ralph chase.\" So yes, they are listed as tackles.\n\n3. Wait a second, I should also ensure that these players are correctly associated with their positions without any mix-ups in other rows. Let me scan through the rest to make sure there's no conflicting information.\n\nLooking at Row 3: Guards - different names, so not relevant here.\nRow 4: Center - Edward L McMillan, which is a single name, not related.\nRow 5: Quarterback - Benny Friedman, another position.\nRow 6: Halfbacks and Fullback in other rows.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"friedman play fullback and mcmillan play quarterback\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.

Scanning through the rows, I find \"benny friedman\" in Row 5.\n- In this row, the position listed is \"quarterback\".\n- The claim states that Friedman played as a fullback, but according to the table, he was a quarterback. This suggests the first part of the claim might be false.\n\nNext, checking McMillan:\n- I look for McMillan's name in the \"name\" column. Scanning through, I find \"edward l mcmillan\" in Row 4.\n- The position listed here is \"center\".\n- The claim states that McMillan played as a quarterback, but the table shows he was a center.
