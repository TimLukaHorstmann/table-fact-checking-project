    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"ann strother (g) be from conneticut\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's start by understanding what each part of the claim refers to.\n\nFirst, the player in question is Ann Strother, who plays as a guard (denoted by 'g'). The claim states that she is from Connecticut. Now, I'll look through the table to find any information related to her and where she's from.\n\nLooking at the table rows, Row 5 mentions \"ann strother (g)\". Let me check the details in this row:\n\n- Player: ann strother (g)\n- Nationality: united states\n- New WNBA team: atlanta dream\n- Former WNBA team: indiana fever\n- College / country / team: connecticut\n\nThe relevant columns here are \"nationality\" and \"college / country / team\". The nationality is listed as 'united states', which doesn't directly indicate she's from Connecticut. However, the \"college / country / team\" column mentions 'connecticut'. This likely refers to her college or previous team.\n\nIn WNBA drafts, players often come from colleges, so if it says 'connecticut' here, it probably means she played college basketball for the University of Connecticut (UConn). So, while her nationality is American, her collegiate background is in Connecticut. \n\nThe claim states she's \"from\" Connecticut. Depending on interpretation, this could mean her home state or where she went to college. Since her college was in Connecticut, it's reasonable to infer that she is associated with Connecticut through her education.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be supported by the table because Ann Strother's collegiate team was from Connecticut.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Ann Strother played for the University of Connecticut, as indicated in the \"college / country / team\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"college / country / team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim about Ann Strother is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim: \"Ann Strother (g) player be from connecticut and be never play on Indiana Fever.\"\n\nFirst, I'll check where Ann Strother is listed in the table. Looking through each row by the player's name, I find her in Row 5.\n\nIn that row, under 'college / country / team,' it says \"connecticut.\" So, she is indeed from Connecticut, which supports the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, the claim states she never played for the Indiana Fever. The table shows her former WNBA team as \"indiana fever.\" This directly contradicts the second part of the claim because she did play for that team.\n\nTherefore, since one part of the claim is true and the other is false, the entire claim isn't fully supported. So, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim has two parts: Ann Strother being from Connecticut (TRUE) and never playing for Indiana Fever (FALSE). Since both conditions must hold for the claim to be TRUE, it's FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"college / country / team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"former wnba team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
