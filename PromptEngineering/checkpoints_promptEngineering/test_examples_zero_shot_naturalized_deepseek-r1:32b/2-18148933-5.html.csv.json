    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"david frost be from united state\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find where David Frost's information is listed. Scanning the rows, I see that Row 3 mentions David Frost as the player. The relevant columns for this claim are \"player\" and \"country\".\n\nIn Row 3, under the \"player\" column, it's confirmed that the player is David Frost. Moving to the \"country\" column in the same row, it specifies that his country is South Africa.\n\nThe claim states that David Frost is from the United States, but according to the table, he is from South Africa. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo, I'll mark the answer as FALSE and include the relevant cells: Row 3's \"player\" and \"country\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
