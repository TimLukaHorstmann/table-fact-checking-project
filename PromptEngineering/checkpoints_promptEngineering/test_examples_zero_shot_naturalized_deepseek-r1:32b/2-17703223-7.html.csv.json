    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"bruno brand\u00e3o from brazil have a snatch of 157.0\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for Bruno Brand\u00e3o in the table. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 4: name is Bruno Brand\u00e3o (BRA). That's Brazil, so that matches the country part of the claim.\n  \nNow, checking his snatch weight. In the same row, under the 'snatch' column, it says 157.0. The claim states he has a snatch of 157.0, which aligns perfectly.\n\nSo both the name and the snatch value match exactly what's in the table. There doesn't seem to be any discrepancy here. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_ cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"snatch\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"there be only 1 person with a snatch of 153.0 and his total bodyweight be 104.70\"\n\nFirst, I should check how many people have a snatch of exactly 153.0 kg. Looking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Snatch is 175.0\nRow 2: Snatch is 160.0\nRow 3: Snatch is 150.0\nRow 4: Snatch is 157.0\nRow 5: Snatch is 153.0 \u2013 this matches.\nRow 6: Snatch is 140.0\nRow 7: Snatch is 140.0 (but clean & jerk is missing, so DNF)\nRow 8: Both snatch and clean & jerk are missing, DNF.\nRow 9: Same as row 8, DNF.\nRow 10: Both missing, DNF.\nRow 11: Snatch is 151.0\n\nSo only Row 5 has a snatch of exactly 153.0 kg.\n\nNext, I need to check the bodyweight for that person. The claim says the total bodyweight should be 104.70. Looking at Row 5:\n\nBodyweight: 104.7 \u2013 which is equal to 104.70 when considering decimal places. So this matches.\n\nNow, I need to confirm there's only one person with a snatch of 153.0 and that their bodyweight is exactly 104.70. Since Row 5 is the only one with snatch 153.0 and its bodyweight is 104.7 (which is 104.70), the claim holds.\n\nSo, I can conclude it's TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"snatch\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bodyweight\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. I'll need to carefully analyze each part of the claim and cross-reference it with the information in the table.\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim:\n\n\"the person with the snatch 153.0 and clean & jerk of 180.0 be [likely a typo for 'is'] Jos\u00e9 Espinoza (nca) with total bodyweight greater than 100 kg\"\n\nSo, there are three main parts to this claim:\n1. There's a person with a snatch of 153.0 and clean & jerk of 180.0.\n2. This person is identified as Jos\u00e9 Espinoza (nca).\n3. His total bodyweight is greater than 100 kg.\n\nNow, I'll go through each part to verify against the table.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 5: name: christian l\u00f3pez ( gua ), bodyweight: 104.7, snatch: 153.0, clean & jerk: 182.0, total 335.0\n\nWait, that's a problem because in Row 5, the clean & jerk is 182.0, not 180.0 as per the claim. So maybe I need to check other rows.\n\nRow 4: bruno brand\u00e3o ( bra ), bodyweight 99.1, snatch 157.0, clean & jerk 180.0, total 337.0\n\nSo here's a clean & jerk of 180.0 but the snatch is 157.0, not 153.0.\n\nLooking for a combination where snatch is 153 and clean & jerk is 180.\n\nWait, Row 5 has snatch 153.0 but clean & jerk 182.0. So no match there.\n\nIs there any row with both 153.0 snatch and 180.0 clean & jerk? Let me check all rows:\n\nRow 1: snatch 175, clean 205\nRow 2: 160/180 (but snatch is 160)\nRow 3: 150/188\nRow4: 157/180\nRow5:153/182\nRow6:140/176\nRows7-11 don't have both snatch and clean&jerk filled.\n\nSo, there's no row where both snatch is exactly 153.0 and clean & jerk is exactly 180.0. So the first part of the claim is false because such a person doesn't exist in the table.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread. Let me double-check each row for the exact values.\n\nRow4 has clean&jerk 180 but snatch 157.\n\nRow5: snatch 153, clean&jerk 182.\n\nNo other rows have clean&jerk as 180 except Row4 and maybe others with missing data. So no row matches both 153 and 180.\n\nThus, the first condition is not met because there's no person in the table with those exact snatch and clean & jerk numbers.\n\nNow, even if that were true, let's check Jos\u00e9 Espinoza (nca). Looking at Row 8: name is jos\u00e9 espinoza ( nca ), bodyweight 99.4, which is less than 100 kg. But the claim says his total bodyweight is greater than 100 kg.\n\nWait, but according to the table, Jos\u00e9 Espinoza's bodyweight is 99.4 kg, so it's not greater than 100 kg. So even if he were the one with those lifts (which he isn't), his weight doesn't meet that condition either.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the other details for Jos\u00e9 Espinoza: his snatch and clean&jerk are marked as '-', which means he didn't perform or did not achieve a result in those categories. So he certainly doesn't have 153.0 and 180.0 in snatch and clean&jerk.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are incorrect based on the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there's no person with both snatch 153.0 and clean & jerk 180.0, Jos\u00e9 Espinoza doesn't have those lifts, and his bodyweight isn't over 100 kg.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"clean & jerk\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"snatch\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"bodyweight\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
