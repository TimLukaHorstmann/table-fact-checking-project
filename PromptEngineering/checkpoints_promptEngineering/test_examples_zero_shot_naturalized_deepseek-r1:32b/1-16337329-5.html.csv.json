    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break down what's being asked.\n\nThe claim states two things:\n1. \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares 'may you do' be the imperative\"\n2. \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs gari  'you did' be the past habitual\"\n\nI'll check each part against the table to see if they match.\n\nFirst, looking at the imperative form for \"gares\". From the table:\n- In Row 3, under the imperative column, it's written as \u0917\u0930\u0947s gares with the meaning 'may you do'. So that matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, checking the past habitual. The claim mentions \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs\" (gari) as past habitual for 'you did'.\nLooking at Row 3 again:\n- The past habitual column has \u0917\u0930\u093fs garis with meaning 'you did'. So this also matches the second part of the claim.\n\nWait, but in the table, it's actually written as \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari s\" (with a space), which might be a typo. But since the claim uses \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s\", I think it's acceptable considering possible formatting issues.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are correctly represented in Row 3 under imperative and past habitual columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as both statements are supported by the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"imperative\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"past habitual\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user has provided a table in naturalized format and a claim about two specific conjugations of the Nepali verb \"\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u094b\u0938\u094d\" (garnuhos), which I believe is related to the root verb \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u094b\u0938\u094d\" meaning 'to do' or similar. The claim states that \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did'\" is the past habitual form and \"\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do'\" is the probable future form.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table provided. It seems each row represents a different grammatical person and number combination in Nepali. The columns include various tenses such as simple present/future, probable future, simple past, past habitual, injunctive, imperative, etc.\n\nLooking at the claim, it mentions two specific forms: \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari\" for past habitual and \"\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\" for probable future. I need to check these against the table's relevant rows and columns.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1 is about first person singular. The column names are simple present/future, probable future, simple past, past habitual, injunctive, imperative. The probable future here is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0941 garchu\", which is for 'I will do'. The past habitual is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0901 gar\u1ebd\". This row doesn't pertain to the second person, so it's not relevant.\n\nRow 2 deals with first person plural. Probable future is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c\u0901 garcha\u0169\" and past habitual is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094c garya\u0169\". Again, this is about 'we', so not relevant for 'you'.\n\nRow 3: Second person singular low-grade. Here, the probable future is \"\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\", which matches the claim's probable future form. The past habitual is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis\" in this row. So, according to the table, \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\" is indeed the past habitual for second person singular low-grade.\n\nRow 4: Second person middle-grade/plural. Probable future is \"\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c garchau\", which doesn't match the claim's \"\u0930\u094d\u0938\u094d garchas\". The past habitual here is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094c garyau\", so it's a different form.\n\nRow 5: High-grade, probably for second person plural or formal. Probable future is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u091b garnuhuncha\", which doesn't match the claim. The past habitual here is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u092d\u092f\u094b garnubhayo\".\n\nRow 6 and 7 are third person singular and plural, so they don't apply to 'you'.\n\nTherefore, focusing on Row 3: For second person singular low-grade, the probable future is correctly listed as \"\u0930\u094d\u0938\u094d garchas\", and the past habitual is indeed \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis\". Both parts of the claim are accurate according to this row.\n\nSo, the claim that \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did'\" is the past habitual and \"\u0930\u094d\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do'\" is the probable future holds true based on Row 3's data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately references the past habitual and probable future forms for the second person singular low-grade conjugation, as shown in Row 3 of the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"past habitual\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"probable future\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It mentions two words in Nepali: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b\" and \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b\", along with their translations as 'he used to do' and 'he did'. The claim associates these with specific grammatical terms: injunctive and past habitual.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row corresponds to different persons and tenses. Let me go through each row one by one to find where these forms appear.\n\nRow 6 is about the third person singular low-grade. Looking at this row:\n\n- Probable future: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b garcha 'he does'\n- Simple past: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e garl\u0101 'he will (probably) do'\n- Past habitual: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo 'he did'\n- Injunctive: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo 'he used to do'\n- Imperative: \u0917\u0930\u094b\u0938\u094d garos 'may he do'\n\nSo, for the third person singular low-grade, \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b\" is listed under past habitual and \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0dae\u094d\u092f\u094b\" (which I think might be a typo as it's written as \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b\") is under injunctive. The translations match: 'he did' for past habitual and 'he used to do' for injunctive.\n\nNow, the claim states that \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0dae\u094d\u092f\u094b\" (garthyo) is the injunctive and \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b\" (garyo) is the past habitual.

The claim is stating that the imperative form corresponding to the past habitual verb form \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\" (gari) which translates to 'you did', should be \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\" (gares), meaning 'may you do'.\n\nI need to check the table to see if this relationship holds. Looking at the table structure, each row represents different grammatical persons and tenses. The columns are: simple present/future, probable future, simple past, past habitual, injunctive, imperative.\n\nLet's look for \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\" (gari) in the past habitual column. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 1 is first person singular.\n- Row 2 is first person plural.\n- Row 3 is second person singular low-grade.\n- In row 3, under 'past habitual', we have \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\" (gari). That's the form mentioned in the claim.\n\nNow, according to the claim, the imperative of this past habitual form should be \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\" (gares). So I need to check what the imperative form is for the same row where 'past habitual' is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\".\n\nLooking at row 3's 'imperative' column: it says \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\" (gares) with the translation 'may you do'. That matches exactly what the claim states. \n\nTherefore, the imperative form corresponding to the past habitual \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u094d\" is indeed \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\".

The claim is about two specific forms related to the verb conjugation for the second person singular low-grade.\n\nLooking at Row 3 of the table, which deals with the second person singular low-grade:\n- Probable future: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do'\n- Simple past: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0938\u094d garl\u0101s 'you will (probably) do'\n- Past habitual: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis 'you did'\n\nSo the claim is stating that \"\u0917\u0930\u093f gari\" is the past habitual form of \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\". However, in Row 3, under the past habitual column, it's listed as \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis\", not \"\u0917\u0930\u093f gari\".\n\nWait a second. The claim uses \"\u0917\u0930\u093f gari\" without the 's' at the end. In the table, the past habitual is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis\". That extra 's' might be significant. It could indicate a different form or perhaps a typo in the claim.\n\nAlso, I should check if there's another row where \"\u0917\u0930\u093f gari\" appears as a past habitual. Looking through all the rows:\n- Row 1: First person singular. Past habitual is \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0901 gar\u1ebd.\n- Row 2: First person plural. Past habitual is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094c garya\u0169.\n- Row 3: Second person singular low-grade. Past habitual is \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis.\n- Row 4: Second person middle-grade/plural. Past habitual is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094c garyau.\n- Row 5: High grade. Past habitual is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u092d\u092f\u094b garnubhayo.\n- Row 6: Third person singular low-grade. Past habitual is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo.\n- Row 7: Third person middle-grade/plural masculine. Past habitual is \u0917\u0930\u0947 gare.\n\nSo \"\u0917\u0930\u093f gari\" doesn't appear in any row as a past habitual form. The closest match is in Row 3, but it's \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis\", which includes an 's' at the end.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"\u0917\u0930\u093f gari\" is the past habitual of \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\" isn't supported by the table.

I need to check if this aligns with the information provided in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure: Each row corresponds to different grammatical persons and tenses. The columns are the various verb forms like probable future, simple past, past habitual, etc.\n\nThe claim is about a third person singular low-grade conjugation. So I should look for the row that matches this description. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 6: It's labeled as \"third person singular low-grade\". This seems relevant because the claim refers to 'he', which is third person singular.\n\nIn row 6, let's examine each column:\n- Probable future: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b garcha, translated as 'he does'.\n- Past habitual: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo, translated as 'he did'.\n\nSo according to the table, \"garyo\" is indeed the past habitual form of \"garcha\". Therefore, the claim appears to be correct.\n\nI should also verify if there are any other rows that might have conflicting information. Let me glance through other relevant rows just to be sure:\n\n- Row 1: First person singular; doesn't apply here.\n- Rows 2 and 3: Plural or second person; not relevant for 'he'.\n- Rows 5,7: Different grades or persons; not applicable.\n\nSo the only row that pertains to third person singular low-grade is row 6. The information there supports the claim without any contradictions.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cell is in row 6 under the 'past habitual' column.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"past habitual\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo 'he use to do , ' be the injunctive of \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo 'he did'\". \n\nFirst, let's break down what this means. The claim is saying that in the table, there's an entry where the word \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094b\" (garthyo) is the injunctive form corresponding to \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b\" (garyo), which translates to 'he did'. \n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different grammatical person and grade. I need to find where \"garyo\" appears as the past habitual form and then check if its corresponding injunctive is indeed \"garthyo\".\n\nStarting with Row 6: It's for third person singular low-grade. The probable future is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b garcha, simple past is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e garl\u0101, past habitual is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo, which matches the claim. Now, looking at the injunctive column in Row 6, it's \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094b garthyo. So this aligns with the claim.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if there are other rows where \"garyo\" appears. Looking through all rows:\n\n- Row 3: past habitual is \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis (second person singular low-grade).\n- Row 4: past habitual is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094c garyau (middle grade/plural).\n- Row 5: past habitual is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u092d\u092f\u094b garnubhayo (high grade).\n- Row 7: past habitual is \u0917\u0930\u0947 gare (third person plural masculine).\n\nSo only in Row 6 does the past habitual form match \"garyo\". And in that row, the injunctive is indeed \"garthyo\". Therefore, the claim seems correct.\n\nI think I've covered all possibilities and verified that the relevant cells are in Row 6 for both the past habitual and injunctive forms. So the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"past habitual\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"injunctive\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares 'may you do' be the injunctive for \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did'.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify what each part of the claim is referring to. The claim mentions two Nepali verb forms: \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s\" (gares) and \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\" (garis). It states that \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s\" is the injunctive form for \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d.\" So, I need to check if in the table, these two verbs are connected as such.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents different persons and grades with various tenses. Each cell under a row provides a verb form along with its English translation. The columns include categories like \"probable future,\" \"simple past,\" \"past habitual,\" \"injunctive,\" and \"imperative.\"\n\nI should focus on the rows that pertain to the second person, since both verbs in the claim seem to be directed at 'you.' Let me look through each row:\n\n- Row 3: Second person singular low-grade. Here, under the \"probable future\" column is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\" meaning 'you (will) do'. The \"simple past\" is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0938\u094d garl\u0101s\" which translates to 'you will (probably) do', but that seems a bit off. Wait, maybe I should double-check that. Then, the \"past habitual\" is \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs garis\" with the translation 'you did'. The \"injunctive\" here is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0938\u094d garthis\" meaning 'you used to do', and the \"imperative\" is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\" translated as 'may you do'.\n\nWait a second, so in Row 3, under \"past habitual,\" we have \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs garis\" which means 'you did.' The injunctive for this row is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0938\u094d garthis.\" But the claim says that \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\" is the injunctive for \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs gari.\" However, in Row 3, \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\" is under the imperative column, not the injunctive. The injunctive here is a different form.\n\nThen I check other rows to see if there's another instance where \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\" appears as an injunctive elsewhere. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: First person singular.\n- Injunctive: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0901 garth\u1ebd 'i used to do'\n\nRow 2: First person plural.\n- Injunctive: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094c\u0901 garthya\u0169 'we used to do'\n\nRow 3: Second person singular low-grade.\n- Injunctive: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0938\u094d garthis 'you used to do'\n- Imperative: \u0917\u0930\u0947s gares 'may you do'\n\nRow 4: Second person middle-grade/plural.\n- Injunctive: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094c garthyau 'you used to do'\n\nRow 5: High grade (probably second person respectful).\n- Injunctive: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garnuhunthyo 'you used to do'\n\nRow 6: Third person singular low-grade.\n- Injunctive: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo 'he used to do'\n\nRow 7: Third person middle-grade/plural masculine.\n- Injunctive: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947 garthe 'they used to do'\n\nSo, in all these rows, the injunctive forms don't include \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares.\" Instead, \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s\" is listed under the imperative column in Row 3. Therefore, the claim that \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s\" is the injunctive for \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\" is incorrect because according to the table, \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s\" is an imperative form, not the injunctive.\n\nThe relevant cells here are:\n\n- In Row 3, the \"past habitual\" column shows \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs garis\" meaning 'you did'.\n- The same row's \"injunctive\" column has \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0938\u094d garthis\" which is 'you used to do', not \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s\".\n- Also, the \"imperative\" column in Row 3 has \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\" as 'may you do'.\n\nSo these cells are relevant because they show where each form appears and their respective meanings.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\" is the injunctive for \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis.\" However, according to the table:\n\n- In Row 3 (second person singular low-grade), \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis\" is under \"past habitual\" meaning 'you did.'\n- The injunctive in this row is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0938\u094d garthis,\" not \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s.\"\n- \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\" appears in the imperative column, meaning 'may you do.'\n\nThus, the claim is incorrect because \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s\" is not the injunctive form but rather the imperative.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"past habitual\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"injunctive\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"imperative\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is talking about a grammatical form in Nepali. The word in question is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0938\u094d (garchas), which the table says means \"you (will) do\" under the probable future tense for the second person singular low-grade. The claim states that its probable future is \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d (gari), which the table lists as the past habitual form, meaning \"you did\".\n\nWait, no, looking again: in row 3, column 'probable future' is garchas, and the 'past habitual' is garis. So the claim says that the probable future of garchas is garis, but according to the table, garis is actually under past habitual, not probable future.\n\nSo the claim seems to be incorrect because it's mixing up the tenses. The probable future for second person singular low-grade is garchas, and the past habitual is garis. So the claim incorrectly states that the probable future of garchas (which itself is a probable future form) is garis, which is a different tense.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because the table shows that garis is in the past habitual column, not the probable future.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly associates the probable future with a past form.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the past habitual of \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did' be \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares 'may you do'\". \n\nFirst, I need to break down what each part means. The claim is talking about a specific conjugation form in the verb paradigm presented in the table. Specifically, it's referring to the \"past habitual\" tense of a certain pronoun.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents different persons and numbers (like first person singular, plural, etc.). I need to find which row corresponds to the subject \"you\". From the table:\n\n- Row 3: second person singular low-grade\n- Row 4: second person middle-grade/plural\n\nThe claim uses \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did', so this likely refers to a past tense form. Let me check Row 3 and Row 4 for past habitual.\n\nIn Row 3, the column \"past habitual\" has the value \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis with the meaning 'you did'. The claim is about the past habitual of this form being something else. Wait, actually, no\u2014the claim says that the past habitual (of gari) should be gares. Let me make sure I'm interpreting correctly.\n\nWait, the claim is phrased a bit confusingly: \"the past habitual of \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did' be \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares 'may you do'\". So it's saying that the past habitual form corresponding to gari (which is in row 3) should be gares. But looking at Row 3, the past habitual column has \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis, and the imperative is \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares with meaning 'may you do'.\n\nSo according to the table, the imperative of Row 3 is gares, not the past habitual. The past habitual in Row 3 is garis. Therefore, the claim incorrectly states that the past habitual form (garis) is gares, which is actually the imperative.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine. The claim says: \"the past habitual of \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did' be \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares 'may you do'\". So it's claiming that the past habitual form (which is garis in Row 3) should instead be gares, which is the imperative.\n\nBut according to the table, Row 3 has:\n\n- probable future: garchas\n- simple past: garl\u0101s\n- past habitual: garis\n- injunctive: garthis\n- imperative: gares\n\nSo the past habitual is indeed garis, and the imperative is gares. The claim is incorrectly stating that the past habitual is gares, which doesn't match the table.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me check again. The claim says \"the past habitual of \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did' be \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares 'may you do'\". So it's saying that the past habitual form should be gares instead of garis.\n\nLooking at Row 3, past habitual is garis. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because the past habitual is not gares but garis. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing which form corresponds to which.\n\nWait, let me look again:\n\nRow 3: second person singular low-grade\n\n- probable future: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do'\n- simple past: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0938\u094d garl\u0101s 'you will (probably) do' (this seems off, perhaps a translation issue)\n- past habitual: \u0917\u0930\u093f \u0938\u094d garis 'you did'\n- injunctive: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f \u0938\u094d garthis 'you used to do'\n- imperative: \u0917\u0930\u0947 \u0938\u094d gares 'may you do'\n\nSo according to the table, the past habitual is garis, and the imperative is gares. The claim states that the past habitual should be gares, which contradicts the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to another row. Let me check Row 4 as well:\n\nRow 4: second person middle-grade/plural\n\n- probable future: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093e\u092e\u094d gartham\n- simple past: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094b gartho\n- past habitual: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947 garthe\n- injunctive: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0941\u0903 garthu\u1e25\n- imperative: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0941\u092e\u094d garthum\n\nSo Row 4's imperative is garthum, which doesn't match gares.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is referring to Row 3's past habitual as being gares. But according to Row 3, past habitual is garis. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states that the past habitual form should be gares instead of garis. So the answer would be FALSE, and the relevant cell is row 3, column 'past habitual'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the claim. Maybe the claim is saying that the past habitual form (garis) is actually supposed to be gares, which is incorrect according to the table.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the past habitual of \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did' be \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares 'may you do'\". So it's equating the past habitual form (garis) with gares. According to the table, that's incorrect because garis is the past habitual and gares is the imperative.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE, and the relevant cell is in Row 3 under 'past habitual', which shows garis as the correct form.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that the past habitual form is gares instead of garis. According to the table, Row 3's past habitual is garis, so the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"past_habitual\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut since in the example, row indices start at 0, Row 3 would be index 2. However, checking again:\n\nWait, actually, rows are indexed from 0. So Row 1 is index 0? Or perhaps I should recount.\n\nWait, looking back, each row's header is:\n\nRow 1: first person singular\nRow 2: first person plural\nRow 3: second person singular low-grade\nRow 4: second person middle-grade/plural\nRow 5: third person singular masculine\nRow 6: third person singular feminine\nRow 7: third person plural\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me recount:\n\nAssuming the table starts at row_index 0 as first person singular (Row 1 in description). So Row 3 would be index 2.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to list all rows clearly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row is indexed starting from 0 as per their order. For example:\n\n- Row 0: first person singular\n- Row 1: first person plural\n- Row 2: second person singular low-grade (which would be the one in question)\n- etc.\n\nIn that case, Row 3 is index 2.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, perhaps I should map each row correctly:\n\nThe rows are as follows (assuming starting from 0):\n\n0: first person singular\n1: first person plural\n2: second person singular low-grade\n3: second person middle-grade/plural\n4: third person singular masculine\n5: third person singular feminine\n6: third person plural\n\nSo Row 3 is index 3. But in the claim, it's about the past habitual of \"you\", which would be in Row 2 (second person singular low-grade) or Row 3.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused now. Let me clarify:\n\nThe claim refers to \"you did\" as garis, which is in Row 3 (as per the initial count where each row starts at index 0). Therefore, Row 3's past habitual is garis, so the relevant cell is Row 2 if starting from 0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the rows as:\n\n- First person singular: row_index 0\n- First person plural: row_index 1\n- Second person singular low-grade: row_index 2 (Row 3)\n- So for Row 3 in the description, it would be row_index 2.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cell is row_index 2 and column_name past_habitual.\n\nThus, the answer should reflect that the claim is incorrect because the past habitual form is garis, not gares. Therefore:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"past_habitual\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nHowever, to ensure accuracy, perhaps it's better to verify that the row index corresponds correctly.\n\nGiven the user instruction may have different starting points, but for clarity and based on initial description:\n\nThe second person singular low-grade is Row 3 in their list, which would be index 2 if starting from 0. So yes, relevant cell is at row_index 2.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"the phrase \u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0932\u093e gar\u0169l\u0101 'i will (probably) do' in simple past be \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garnuhunthyo 'you use to do' in the injunctive\".\n\nFirst, I need to parse this claim carefully. It seems like it's making a statement that a certain phrase from one part of the table is equivalent or corresponds to another phrase in a different part. Let me try to understand each part.\n\nThe first part mentions \"gar\u0169l\u0101 'i will (probably) do' in simple past\". Looking at the table, I'll check which row and column this refers to. The term \"simple past\" is one of the columns. Now, looking through the rows:\n\nRow 1: First person singular.\n- Under simple past, it's \u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0932\u093e gar\u0169l\u0101 'i will (probably) do'.\n\nSo, that's correct for the first part: in Row 1, under \"simple past\", we have \u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0932\u093e\u0930 which matches the claim.\n\nNow, the second part of the claim says this phrase should be \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garnuhunthyo 'you use to do' in the injunctive. Let's check the table for \"injunctive\" and see what it has under that column.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 5 is labeled as \"high grade\". Under the injunctive column, Row 5 has \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garnuhunthyo 'you used to do'.\n\nSo, the claim is saying that the simple past phrase from Row 1 (gar\u0169l\u0101) should be equivalent to the injunctive form in Row 5 (garnuhunthyo). But wait, are these two forms supposed to match?\n\nWait a minute. The claim seems to conflate two different things: it's stating that the simple past of one person is equal to the injunctive of another. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the table:\n- Row 1 (first person singular) has in \"simple past\" gar\u0169l\u0101, which means 'i will probably do'.\n- Row 5 (high grade) under \"injunctive\" has garnuhunthyo meaning 'you used to do'.\n\nThe claim is asserting that gar\u0169l\u0101 (from simple past of first person singular) is the same as garnuhunthyo (injunctive of high grade). That doesn't seem correct because they belong to different grammatical categories and persons.\n\nFurthermore, in Row 1, under \"injunctive\", it's garth\u1ebd, which is 'i used to do'. So the injunctive form for first person singular is different from garnuhunthyo.\n\nTherefore, the claim incorrectly states that the simple past of first person singular (gar\u0169l\u0101) is the same as the injunctive of high grade (garnuhunthyo). They are not equivalent; they belong to different tenses and persons.\n\nSo, checking relevant cells:\n- Row 1, \"simple past\": gar\u0169l\u0101\n- Row 5, \"injunctive\": garnuhunthyo\n\nThese are two distinct entries in the table. The claim incorrectly equates them, so it's FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that a simple past form is equivalent to an injunctive form from another row. They belong to different grammatical categories and persons.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"simple past\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"injunctive\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the phrase \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c\u0901 garcha\u0169 'we (will) do' in the probable future be \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo 'he use to do' in the imperative.\"\n\nHmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at each part of the claim. The claim is comparing two phrases from the table: one is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c\u0901 garcha\u0169\" and the other is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094b garthyo.\" It states that in the probable future tense, the first phrase 'we (will) do' should be in the imperative as the second phrase 'he used to do.'\n\nWait, no. Actually, reading it again: the claim seems to say that the phrase \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c\u0901\" which is in the probable future for 'we will do' is equivalent to \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b\" in the imperative, meaning 'may he do.' But I'm not sure if that's what it's saying. Maybe I misread.\n\nLet me clarify: The claim states that the phrase \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c\u0901 garcha\u0169 'we (will) do'\" in the probable future is equivalent to \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo 'he used to do'\" in the imperative. So, it's claiming that these two phrases are the same in their respective tenses.\n\nTo check this, I need to look at the table and see where each of these phrases appears.\n\nLooking at Row 2: The row is about first person plural. In the \"probable future\" column, it says \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c\u0901 garcha\u0169 'we (will) do.' So that's correct for the probable future tense in the first person plural.\n\nNow, looking for \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094b garthyo.\" Let me scan through each row. In Row 3: second person singular low-grade. The injunctive is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0938\u094d garthis. Not matching. Row 4: second person middle grade/plural. The injunctive is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094c garthyau, which is similar but not the same as \"garthyo.\" Wait, row 6 is third person singular low-grade. The imperative column has \u0917\u0930\u094b\u0938\u094d garos. Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let's check all rows for the phrase \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094b garthyo.\"\n\nLooking at Row 1: first person singular. Injunctive is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0901 garth\u1ebd. Close but not the same. \n\nRow 2: first person plural. Injunctive isn't listed here; looking at other tenses, no match.\n\nRow 3: second person singular low-grade. Injunctive is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0938\u094d garthis. Not matching.\n\nRow 4: second person middle/plural. Injunctive is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0ca5\u094d\u092f\u094c garthyau. Hmm, that's similar but ends with 'yau' instead of 'yo.' \n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong column. The claim says \"in the imperative.\" So for the phrase \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094b,\" I should look under the imperative column.\n\nLooking at each row's imperative:\n\nRow 1: \u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901 gar\u0169\nRow 2: \u0917\u0930\u094c\u0901 gara\u0169\nRow 3: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares\nRow 4: \u0917\u0930\u094c garau\nRow 5: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u094b\u0938\u094d garnuhos\nRow 6: \u0917\u0930\u094b\u0938\u094d garos\nRow 7: \u0917\u0930\u0942\u0928\u094d gar\u016bn\n\nNone of these imperatives are \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b.\" So where is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094b\"?\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong column. Let me check all cells for \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094b.\"\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: probable future is \u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u092c\u093f\u091b gurunbich? No.\n\nRow 2: probable future is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c\u0901 garcha\u0169. That's the first part of the claim.\n\nInjunctive in Row 1: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0901 garth\u1ebd\nRow 3: injunctive is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0ca5\u093f\u0938\u094d garthis\nRow 4: injunctive is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u094d\u092f\u094c garthyau\n\nWait, none of these are \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094b.\" Did I miss a row?\n\nLooking at Row 6 again. It's third person singular low-grade. The imperative is \u0917\u0930\u094b\u0938\u094d garos. So not matching.\n\nRow 7: third person plural? Imperative is \u0917\u0930\u0942\u0928\u094d gar\u016bn.\n\nWait, perhaps the phrase \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094b\" isn't present in the table at all. Or maybe I'm misreading it. Let me check again each row's injunctive:\n\nRow 1: injunctive is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0ca5\u0947\u0901 (garth\u1ebd)\nRow 2: no injunctive listed, as it's first person plural\nWait, looking back, Row 2 has \"probable future\" and other columns but not injunctive. So perhaps the injunctive for first person plural isn't listed here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to look at different tenses or columns. The claim mentions that \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c\u0901\" is in the probable future (which we found in Row 2) and claims it's equivalent in imperative to \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094b.\" But looking through all imperatives, none match.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems incorrect because \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094b\" isn't listed as an imperative form for any row. So the two phrases aren't equivalent across those tenses.\n\nSo the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the phrase \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c\u0901 garcha\u0169 'we (will) do'\" in the probable future tense is equivalent to \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094b garthyo 'he used to do'\" in the imperative. However, upon reviewing the table, \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094b\" does not appear as an imperative form for any row, making the claim incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"probable future\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"probable future\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do' be the simple past for \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares 'may you do'\". Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table to understand how it's organized. Each row corresponds to a different grammatical person and sometimes grade or number. The columns are various tenses or moods: simple present/future, probable future, simple past, past habitual, injunctive, imperative.\n\nLooking at Row 3: It's about the second person singular low-grade. The relevant cells here are \"probable future\" which is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do' and \"imperative\" which is \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares 'may you do'.\n\nThe claim states that \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d is the simple past of \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d. But in Row 3, under the simple past column, it's \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0938\u094d garl\u0101s with the meaning 'you will (probably) do'. The imperative form is \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares. So, according to the table, the simple past for the second person singular low-grade is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0938\u094d, not \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d.\n\nWait, but in the claim, it's saying that \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d is the simple past of \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d. That would mean under Row 3, the probable future (\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0938\u094d) is being considered as the simple past for the imperative form (\u0917\u0930\u0947 \u0938\u094d). But looking at the table, the simple past in that row is different.\n\nSo, the claim is suggesting a relationship between two forms where one is the present/future and the other is the imperative. The claim incorrectly assigns the probable future form as the simple past of the imperative. According to the table, they are separate entries under different columns for the same person and grade.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by the table because the simple past of \u0917\u0930\u0947 \u0938\u094d (imperative) is actually \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0938\u094d, not \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0938\u094d. Thus, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do' is the simple past for \u0917\u0930\u0947 \u0938\u094d gares 'may you do'\". However, according to the table, in Row 3 (second person singular low-grade), the probable future is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0938\u094d with the meaning 'you (will) do', and the imperative is \u0917\u0930\u0947 \u0938\u094d meaning 'may you do'. The simple past for this row is listed as \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e \u0938\u094d. Therefore, the claim incorrectly associates \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0938\u094d as the simple past of \u0917\u0930\u0947 \u0938\u094d.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"probable future\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"simple past\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"imperative\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
