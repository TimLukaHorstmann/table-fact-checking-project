The claim states: \"all of the mascot except west washington's be base on animal.\" So, I need to check each school's mascot and see if they are all based on animals, except for West Washington.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Crawford County has a mascot called Wolfpack. Wolves are animals, so that fits.\n\nRow 2 is Mitchell with the Bluejackets. Wait, bluejacket isn't an animal; it refers to sailors or military personnel. So this already contradicts the claim because Mitchell's mascot isn't based on an animal. But let me double-check all just to be sure.\n\nRow 3: Orleans has Bulldogs. That's definitely an animal, so that's good.\n\nRow 4: Paoli's mascot is Rams. Rams are animals, so that's fine too.\n\nRow 5: Perry Central's mascot is Commodores. Again, commodores aren't animals; they're related to naval officers or ships. So this is another exception besides West Washington.\n\nRow 6: Springs Valley has Blackhawks. Blackhawks refer to a Native American tribe, not an animal. So that's another one not based on an animal.\n\nRow 7: West Washington's mascot is Senators, which isn't an animal either. But the claim says all except West Washington are based on animals, but we've already found other mascots like Bluejackets, Commodores, and Blackhawkes that aren't animals.\n\nSo the claim is false because there are multiple mascots not based on animals besides West Washington.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table contains. It looks like there are seven rows, each representing a different school with various attributes such as school name, location, mascot, size, IHSAA class, and county.\n\nThe claim is about Mitchell being the only school in the AAA IHSAA class. So, my task is to check if any other schools besides Mitchell have an AAA classification.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. **Row 1: Crawford County** - IHSAA class is AA.\n2. **Row 2: Mitchell** - IHSAA class is AAA.\n3. **Row 3: Orleans** - IHSAA class is A.\n4. **Row 4: Paoli** - IHSAA class is AA.\n5. **Row 5: Perry Central** - IHSAA class is AA.\n6. **Row 6: Springs Valley** - IHSAA class is A.\n7. **Row 7: West Washington** - IHSAA class is A.\n\nFrom this, Mitchell is the only school with AAA classification. The other schools are either in AA or A classes. So, the claim holds true because no other school besides Mitchell has an AAA IHSAA class.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells for each row that have the IHSAA class mentioned:\n\n- **Row 2 (Mitchell)**: This is where the AAA class is specified.\n- For thoroughness, checking all rows to ensure no others have AAA. Rows 1,3,4,5,6,7 do not have AAA.\n\nSo, only Row 2's IHSAA class is relevant here because it's the only one that matters for verifying the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as Mitchell is the sole school with an AAA classification in the given table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ihsaa class\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"orleans be less than half the size of mitchell\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the relevant information needed for each school mentioned in the claim: Orleans and Mitchell. The key metric here is their sizes because the claim compares them.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Row 3 is about Orleans High School. It's located in Orleans with a mascot of Bulldogs. The size listed is 258, which I assume refers to the number of students or the school population.\n- Row 2 is Mitchell High School. Its location is Mitchell, mascot Bluejackets, and the size is 620.\n\nThe claim states that Orleans is less than half the size of Mitchell. To verify this, I need to calculate half of Mitchell's size and see if Orleans' size is indeed less than that.\n\nHalf of Mitchell's size would be 620 divided by 2, which equals 310. Now, comparing this to Orleans' size: 258 is the number given for Orleans. \n\nIs 258 less than 310? Yes, it is. Therefore, Orleans is indeed less than half the size of Mitchell. So the claim holds true.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table were relevant for this determination. For Orleans, the 'size' column under row index 2 (since rows are zero-indexed) is important. Similarly, for Mitchell, it's also the 'size' column but in row index 1.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Row 3 (index 2), column 'size'\n- Row 2 (index 1), column 'size'\n\nPutting this together, the answer should be TRUE with those two cells as relevant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"size\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"size\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

First, I need to understand what each part of the table represents and how it relates to the claim.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a school with various attributes: school name, location, mascot, size, IHSAA class, and county. The claim is about whether all teams are from different countries. Hmm, but in the table, I don't see any column that mentions \"country.\" Instead, there's a \"county\" column which lists numbers followed by names like crawford, lawrence, orange, etc.\n\nSo, the first thought is: does the term \"country\" in the claim actually refer to \"county\"? That seems possible because all entries have a \"county\" specified. If that's the case, then we can proceed under the assumption that the claim is about counties instead of countries.\n\nNow, let's look at each row and note the county:\n\n1. Row 1: crawford\n2. Row 2: lawrence\n3. Row 3: orange\n4. Row 4: orange (same as row 3)\n5. Row 5: perry\n6. Row 6: orange (again, same as rows 3 and 4)\n7. Row 7: washington\n\nWait a minute, I see that the counties are not all unique. For example, both rows 3, 4, and 6 list \"orange\" as their county. That means at least three schools are from the same county. Therefore, if the claim is that all teams are from different countries (or counties), this would be false because some share the same county.\n\nTo confirm, I'll check each row's county:\n\n- Row 1: crawford\n- Row 2: lawrence\n- Row 3: orange\n- Row 4: orange \u2192 duplicate\n- Row 5: perry\n- Row 6: orange \u2192 another duplicate\n- Row 7: washington\n\nYes, there are multiple entries with the same county, specifically \"orange.\" So, not all teams are from different counties.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells are the ones in the \"county\" column for each row where duplicates occur.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all teams are from different countries, but based on the table's \"county\" column, multiple schools share the same county (e.g., orange appears three times).

The claim states: \"Mitchell, Orleans and Paoli be the name of school and also the mascot of the relevant school.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It's saying that for each of these schools\u2014Mitchell, Orleans, and Paoli\u2014their names are both the school's name and their mascot.\n\nLooking at the table row by row:\n\n- Row 1: School is Crawford County, Mascot is Wolfpack. Doesn't relate to Mitchell, so no issue here.\n  \n- Row 2: School is Mitchell. The claim says Mitchell should be both the school name and the mascot. Checking the Mascot column in this row: it's Bluejackets, not Mitchell. So that's a problem because the mascot isn't Mitchell as claimed.\n\nNext, check Orleans:\n\n- Row 3: School is Orleans. Mascot here is Bulldogs. Again, the mascot isn't Orleans as per the claim, so another discrepancy.\n\nThen Paoli:\n\n- Row 4: School is Paoli. Mascot is Rams. The mascot isn't Paoli either, which contradicts the claim.\n\nSo for all three schools\u2014Mitchell, Orleans, and Paoli\u2014the mascots don't match their school names. Each of these schools has a different mascot than their name, so the claim that each uses its own name as both school and mascot is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because none of these schools have their names as mascots.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Mitchell, Orleans, and Paoli are both school names and mascots.

The claim states: \"mitchell be 1 of the 2 school list with an aaa ihsaa class.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this means. It seems like the claim is saying that Mitchell High School is one of two schools listed in the table that have an AAA classification under the IHSSA (Indiana High School Athletic Association) class.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a school with various attributes like location, mascot, size, and IHSAA class. My task is to check how many schools in this table are classified as AAA in their IHSAA class column. \n\nStarting from Row 1:\n- Crawfordsville has an AA classification.\nRow 2:\n- Mitchell's IHSAA class is listed as AAA. So that's one school with AAA.\nRow 3:\n- Orleans is A.\nRow 4:\n- Paoli is AA.\nRow 5:\n- Perry Central is AA.\nRow 6:\n- Springs Valley is A.\nRow 7:\n- West Washington is A.\n\nFrom this, only Mitchell (Row 2) has an AAA classification.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim properly. It seems like it's saying that all the mascots in the table, including West Washington's, are based on animals. So I need to check each mascot in the table and see if they are animal-based names.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. Row 1: Mascot is Wolfpack.\n2. Row 2: Mascot is Bluejackets.\n3. Row 3: Mascot is Bulldogs.\n4. Row 4: Mascot is Rams.\n5. Row 5: Mascot is Commodores.\n6. Row 6: Mascot is Blackhawks.\n7. Row 7: Mascot is Senators.\n\nNow, let's analyze each one:\n\n- Wolfpack: This refers to wolves, which are animals. So that's animal-based.\n- Bluejackets: Wait, Bluejackets sounds like a military term, but in some contexts, it could be related to blue jackets of sailors or something else. But I'm not sure if this is an animal. Maybe it's referring to a type of bird? Or perhaps it's more of a team name without an animal reference.\n- Bulldogs: These are dogs, specifically a breed. So definitely animal-based.\n- Rams: These are male sheep, so animals.\n- Commodores: This term refers to naval officers, not animals. It doesn't relate to any animal mascot.\n- Blackhawks: Blackhawks can refer to the American Indian tribe or a type of bird, like hawks. But in some contexts, it's associated with sports teams, which might use animal mascots, but \"Blackhawk\" could be both an animal and a team name. I think here it refers to the animal.\n- Senators: This is clearly a political term, not related to animals.\n\nWait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine each mascot carefully.\n\n1. Wolfpack: Definitely animals (wolves).\n2. Bluejackets: Hmm, Bluejacket could be a type of bird, but more commonly, it's associated with the Royal Navy or similar, not an animal mascot. Alternatively, maybe it refers to a specific animal, like blue jacketed something? Not sure. I think in this context, it might just be a team name without a direct animal reference.\n3. Bulldogs: Yes, animals.\n4. Rams: Animals.\n5. Commodores: This is a naval term, not an animal.\n6. Blackhawks: These are birds of prey (a type of kite), so yes, animals.\n7. Senators: No, this is related to government or politics.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the claim is about all mascots including West Washington's being based on animals. So I need to check if all the mascots in the table are animal-based.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Row 1: Wolfpack \u2013 yes.\n- Row 2: Bluejackets \u2013 not sure. Let me think. \"Bluejacket\" can refer to a type of bird, but more commonly, it's associated with sailors or military personnel. So perhaps this isn't an animal. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to blue jackets as in uniforms, which wouldn't be an animal.\n- Row 3: Bulldogs \u2013 yes.\n- Row 4: Rams \u2013 yes.\n- Row 5: Commodores \u2013 no, that's a naval rank or title.\n- Row 6: Blackhawks \u2013 yes.\n- Row 7: Senators \u2013 no.\n\nWait, but in row 2, Bluejackets might be referring to the University of Minnesota's mascot, which is actually a live gopher, not bluejackets. Or maybe it's a different school. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, \"bluejacket\" could be a type of bird? Let me think: no, bluejackets are more commonly associated with sailors in the Royal Navy. So Bluejackets is likely a non-animal mascot.\n\nSimilarly, Commodores and Senators are not animals. Therefore, the claim that all mascots, including West Washington's (Senators), are based on animals would be false because there are mascots like Bluejackets, Commodores, and Senators that aren't animal-based.\n\nWait, but wait again. Let me make sure about each mascot:\n\n- Wolfpack: Animal.\n- Bluejackets: Not an animal; it's a military term or possibly referring to the team name without an animal mascot.\n- Bulldogs: Animal.\n- Rams: Animal.\n- Commodores: Not an animal.\n- Blackhawks: Animal (if referring to birds).\n- Senators: Not an animal.\n\nTherefore, since some mascots are not based on animals, the claim is false. The relevant cells would be the mascot column for each row because we need to check each one to verify if all are animal-based. So, for rows 1 through 7, the \"mascot\" column is relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all mascots, including West Washington's, are based on animals.

Looking at the table:\n\n- Orleans is in row 3 with a size of 258.\n- Mitchell is in row 2 with a size of 620.\n\nNext, I need to check if Orleans' size is exactly less than half of Mitchell's size. Calculating half of Mitchell's size: 620 / 2 = 310. \n\nNow, comparing Orleans' size (258) to this value. Is 258 less than 310? Yes, it is. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n\nThe relevant cells are the size entries for both schools, so I'll note their row indices and column names.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"size\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"size\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
