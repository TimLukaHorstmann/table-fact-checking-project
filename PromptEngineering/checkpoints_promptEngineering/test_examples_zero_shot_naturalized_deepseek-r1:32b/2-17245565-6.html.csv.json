The task is to determine whether the claim \"only 2 player score under par at the 1971 us open\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that only two players scored under par in the event. In golf, scoring under par means a player's total score is lower than the standard par set for the course. A negative number under \"to par\" indicates an under-par score.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with their respective scores and \"to par\" values. The relevant columns here are \"player\" and \"to par.\" \n\nI'll go through each row to check the \"to par\" value:\n- Row 1: Jim Simons (A) has -3, which is under par.\n- Row 2: Jack Nicklaus has -1, also under par.\n- Rows 3 onwards have either 'e' (even), '+1', or higher, indicating they are at or above par.\n\nSo, only the first two players scored under par.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the top golfer defeat the player tie for eighth by 5 stroke\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions two main points: the top golfer and a player tied for eighth place. The claim states that the top golfer defeated the eighth-place player by 5 strokes. So I need to check if there's such a difference in their scores.\n\nLooking at the table, the rows are indexed from 1 to 10. Each row contains information about the golfer's placement, name, country, total score, and to par. \n\nThe top golfer would be the one with the best (lowest) score. Let me check the first few rows:\n\nRow 1: Jim Simons with a total score of 207.\nRow 2: Jack Nicklaus with 209.\nRow 3: Bobby Nichols with 210.\n\nSo, Jim Simons is in first place with the lowest score of 207. Now, looking at the players tied for eighth place. The table shows that places are listed as t8 starting from row 8 onwards:\n\nRows 8,9,10 have place: t8. Their scores are 212 each.\n\nNow, to check the difference in strokes between the top golfer (Jim Simons) and the players tied for eighth place. The total score is given, so I can calculate the difference.\n\nJim Simons' score: 207.\nTied eighth players' score: 212.\n\nThe difference would be 212 - 207 = 5 strokes. So the top golfer's score is indeed 5 strokes better than those tied for eighth place.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"the top golfer defeat the player tie for eighth by 5 stroke\" is TRUE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- Jim Simons' total score (Row 1, Score)\n- Each of the t8 players' scores (Rows 8,9,10, Score)\n\nSo the relevant rows are 1 and 8-10, all under the \"score\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"3 players scored better on the first round than the eventual winner\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the table represents. Looking at the columns: place, player name, country, score (which seems to be three rounds summed up), and to par. The scores are in the format of individual round scores adding up to a total. For example, Row 1 shows Jim Simons with scores 71 + 71 + 65 = 207.\n\nThe claim is about the first-round scores. So I need to focus on each player's first round score. The eventual winner would be the person in first place, which according to the table is Row 1: Jim Simons (a). His first-round score is 71.\n\nNow, I have to check how many players scored better than Jim Simons in the first round. A lower score is better in golf. So any player with a first-round score less than 71 would have scored better.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 2: Jack Nicklaus, first round 69.\n- Row 3: Bobby Nichols, first round 69.\n- Row 4: Lee Trevino, first round 70.\n- Row 5: George Archer, first round 71 (same as winner).\n- Row 6: Jim Colbert, first round 69.\n- Row 7: Bob Erickson, first round 71 (same as winner).\n- Rows 8, 9, 10 have higher or equal scores in the first round.\n\nSo, players with first-round scores better than 71 are:\n\n- Jack Nicklaus (69)\n- Bobby Nichols (69)\n- Jim Colbert (69)\n\nThat's three players.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"On the third round, Jim Simon outplayed Jack Nicklaus by 3 strokes.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. \"Outplay\" in golf terms typically means having a lower score than another player, which is better because lower scores win. So, if Jim Simon scored lower on the third round compared to Jack Nicklaus, then he outplayed him. The difference mentioned is 3 strokes.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it's structured with rows for each player and columns like place, player name, country, score, and to par. The scores are listed as three numbers adding up to a total, which I assume are the scores from each of the three rounds.\n\nSo, Jim Simons is in row 1. His scores are 71 + 71 + 65 = 207. Jack Nicklaus is in row 2 with scores 69 + 72 + 68 = 209.\n\nI need to extract the third round score for both players. For Jim Simons, his third round score is 65, and for Jack Nicklaus, it's 68.\n\nNow, comparing these: Jim scored 65, Jack scored 68. The difference between them is 3 strokes (68 - 65 = +3). Since a lower score is better, Jim indeed outplayed Jack by 3 strokes on the third round.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI also need to note which cells are relevant for this determination. For Jim Simons, it's his third round score from row 1, and for Jack Nicklaus, it's his third round score from row 2. So the relevant columns would be the ones containing these individual round scores. Looking at the table structure, the \"score\" column includes three numbers each, representing the three rounds. To pinpoint exactly which cells were used, I can note that in the score for Jim Simons (row 1), it's the third number, 65, and for Jack Nicklaus (row 2), it's the third number, 68.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are the individual round scores of each player, specifically the third one.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"more than 2 player score under par at the 1971 us open\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the table contains. Each row represents a player's performance in a golf tournament, specifically the US Open in 1971. The columns are place, player name, country, score (which includes each round and the total), and to par.\n\nThe claim is about players who scored under par. In golf, scoring \"under par\" means that their total score was lower than the standard par for the course over the tournament. A negative number in the \"to par\" column indicates being under par, while a positive or zero indicates over or exactly at par.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 1: Jim Simons (A) from the US has a to par of -3. This means he scored 3 strokes under par.\n- Row 2: Jack Nicklaus has a to par of -1, which is also under par.\n- Row 3: Bobby Nichols with a to par of 'e' likely stands for even, meaning exactly at par, so not under.\n- Rows 4-7 all have a to par of +1 or higher, indicating they are over par.\n- Rows 8-10 also show to par as +2, which is definitely over.\n\nSo, counting the players who scored under par: Jim Simons and Jack Nicklaus. That's two players. The claim says \"more than 2,\" so I need at least three players for it to be TRUE.\n\nWait, let me double-check each row again to make sure I didn't miss anyone:\n\nRow 1: -3 \u2192 under\nRow 2: -1 \u2192 under\nRow 3: e \u2192 even\nRows 4-7: +1 \u2192 over\nRows 8-10: +2 \u2192 over\n\nNo other players are under par. So only two players scored below par, which doesn't satisfy \"more than 2.\" Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to point out where each player's score was under par. That would be row 1 and row 2 in the 'to par' column.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that only two players scored under par (Jim Simons with -3 and Jack Nicklaus with -1), which does not meet the claim of more than two.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"only 3 golfer score under par on 2 separate round\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim means. It says that only three golfers scored under par in two separate rounds each. So, for a golfer to qualify, they must have had at least two rounds where their score was below (under) par. The table shows each player's total score and their \"to par\" status, which tells me how their overall performance compares to the standard.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a player with their scores from three rounds. For example, Jim Simons has scores 71, 71, and 65, totaling 207, which is under par by 3 strokes (-3). However, just looking at the total score doesn't tell me if they were under par in individual rounds.\n\nWait, but the claim is about two separate rounds, not necessarily both being under par across all three. Hmm, actually, no\u2014the way it's phrased might mean that each golfer had at least two rounds where their score was under par compared to the standard for each round. But the table doesn't provide per-round \"to par\" statuses; it only shows the total score and overall \"to par.\" So I'm a bit confused because without knowing the par for each individual round, I can't directly tell if each round's score was under par.\n\nBut perhaps another approach: maybe the claim refers to the overall performance. If a golfer is under par overall (-1 or better), does that mean they scored under par in at least two rounds? Or maybe it's about how many players have an overall under-par total from two rounds. Wait, no\u2014the table shows three rounds for each player. So perhaps the claim is saying that only three golfers had their scores under par after considering any two of their three rounds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim means that only three golfers have a cumulative score under par in two separate events or tournaments, but I think that's stretching it.\n\nWait, let me look at each player's \"to par\" status. The first row is Jim Simons with -3, so he's definitely under par overall. Jack Nicklaus is -1, also under. Bobby Nichols is even (e), so not under. Lee Trevino and the others are above par.\n\nSo only Jim Simons and Jack Nicklaus have an overall score under par. But that would mean two golfers, not three. Therefore, the claim that \"only 3 golfers scored under par on 2 separate rounds\" seems false because only two players are under par in total.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps it's about each individual round. Let me check each player's scores:\n\n- Jim Simons: 71, 71, 65. Assuming standard par is around 70 or 72, let's say par is 70 for simplicity.\n  - Round 1: 71 (over by 1)\n  - Round 2: 71 (over by 1)\n  - Round 3: 65 (under by 5)\n  So only one round under par.\n\n- Jack Nicklaus: 69, 72, 68. If par is 70:\n  - 69 (under by 1)\n  - 72 (over by 2)\n  - 68 (under by 2)\n  So two rounds under par.\n\nBobby Nichols: 69, 72, 69.\n- Round 1: under\n- Round 2: over\n- Round 3: under\nSo two rounds under.\n\nWait, but Bobby's overall is even, so maybe he's not counted. Hmm, this complicates things because the claim might be about players who had two separate rounds under par regardless of their total.\n\nLooking at each player:\n\n1. Jim Simons: Only one round under.\n2. Jack Nicklaus: Two rounds under.\n3. Bobby Nichols: Two rounds under (69 and 69, but in different rows). Wait, no\u2014his scores are 69, 72, 69. So two rounds under.\n4. Lee Trevino: Scores 70,72,69. Let's assume par is 70:\n   - 70 (even)\n   - 72 (over)\n   - 69 (under by 1). Only one round under.\n\nGeorge Archer: 71,70,70. Par 70:\n- Round 1: over\n- Round 2: even\n- Round 3: even. So no rounds under.\n\nJim Colbert: 69,69,73. Par 70:\n- Round 1: under\n- Round 2: under\n- Round 3: over. So two rounds under.\n\nBob Erickson: 71,67,73.\n- Round 1: over (assuming par 70)\n- Round 2: under by 3\n- Round 3: over. Only one round under.\n\nKen Still: 71,72,69. Par 70:\n- Round 1: over\n- Round 2: over\n- Round 3: under. One round.\n\nLarry Hinson: 71,71,70.\n- Rounds 1 and 2: over\n- Round 3: even. So none under.\n\nBruce Devlin: 72,69,71.\n- Round 1: over\n- Round 2: under by 1\n- Round 3: over. Only one round under.\n\nSo now counting players who had at least two rounds under par:\n\n- Jack Nicklaus: yes (69 and 68)\n- Bobby Nichols: yes (69, 72, 69) \u2013 wait no, his first and third rounds are under.\nWait, if Bobby's \"to par\" is even, but he had two rounds under? That might be possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is that three players have at least one round under par. No, that wouldn't make sense because more than three would have at least one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about having a cumulative score under par in any two of their three rounds.\n\nSo for each player:\n\n- Jim Simons: total after two rounds could be 71+71=142, which is over by 2.\nOr 71+65=136 (if considering first and third) = -4. So if he has two rounds under overall.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused because the claim isn't very clear. But based on overall \"to par,\" only two players are under: Jim Simons (-3) and Jack Nicklaus (-1). Bobby Nichols is even.\n\nSo if the claim says three golfers scored under par in two separate rounds (maybe meaning their total after two rounds), then let's see:\n\nJim Simons:\n- After round 1: +1\n- After round 2: +2\n- After round 3: -3. So only at the end is he under.\n\nJack Nicklaus:\n- After round 1: -1\n- After round 2: -1 + (+2) = +1\n- After round 3: +1 + (-2) = -1. So after first and third rounds, he's under, but not necessarily in two separate points.\n\nBobby Nichols:\n- After round 1: -1\n- After round 2: even (from -1 to over)\n- After round 3: -1 again? Wait no, his scores are 69 (under), 72 (over), 69 (under). So after first round: under; second round: over; third round: under. So he's under at two points but overall even.\n\nIf the claim is about being under par in two separate cumulative rounds (like after first and third), then Bobby might count. But his overall is even, so perhaps not considered as \"scoring under.\"\n\nBut if we're considering each individual round, how many players had at least two rounds under:\n\n- Jack Nicklaus: yes\n- Jim Colbert: yes (69,69)\n- Bobby Nichols: yes (69,69)\n\nSo that's three players. Therefore, the claim is true because there are three players who scored under par in two separate individual rounds.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Bobby was even overall, so perhaps he's not counted as a golfer who has an under-par total from two rounds. But if we're only looking at each round's performance without considering the total, then yes, three players have at least two rounds under par: Jack, Jim C., and Bobby.\n\nBut earlier I thought the claim was about overall score, which would only be two players. So perhaps the confusion is in interpreting \"scored under par on 2 separate rounds.\"\n\nIn that case, if it's about individual round performance regardless of total, then three players meet this: Jack (69,68), Jim C. (69,69), Bobby (69,69). So maybe the claim is correct.\n\nBut in my initial analysis, based on overall \"to par,\" only two are under. However, if it's about individual rounds, then three have at least two under.\n\nSo perhaps the answer depends on interpretation, but given that the claim mentions \"2 separate rounds,\" I think it refers to individual rounds, not cumulative scores. So three players meet this: Jack Nicklaus, Jim Colbert, and Bobby Nichols.\n\nWait, no\u2014Bobby's total is even, so maybe he's excluded if the claim requires a net under after those two rounds. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simpler: how many golfers have an overall \"to par\" of better than even? Only two: Jim S. (-3) and Jack N. (-1). So the claim that only three scored under on 2 separate rounds (meaning their total is under) is false because it's only two.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about the interpretation. Given the ambiguity, but considering the initial data shows only two with negative \"to par,\" I think the correct answer is no, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that only three golfers scored under par on two separate rounds. However, upon analyzing the data:\n\n- **Jim Simons** and **Jack Nicklaus** have overall scores under par (-3 and -1 respectively).\n- **Bobby Nichols**, while having two rounds under par individually, ends with an even score.\n- Other players either didn't meet the criteria or were above par.\n\nThus, only two golfers (Jim Simons and Jack Nicklaus) had their total scores under par. Therefore, the claim is false as it incorrectly states that three golfers achieved this.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{B}",

The claim says: \"more than 4 players scored better on the first round than the eventual winner.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part means.

Looking at the table, row 1 has place 1: Jim Simons (A) from the United States with a total score of 207.\n\nNow, I need to check how many players scored better than him on the first round.

So each player's first round score is listed as the first number in their 'score' column.\n\nLet me list out all the players and their first-round scores:\n\n1. Jim Simons (A): 71\n2. Jack Nicklaus: 69\n3. Bobby Nichols: 69\n4. Lee Trevino: 70\n5. George Archer: 71\n6. Jim Colbert: 69\n7. Bob Erickson: 71\n8. Ken Still: 71\n9. Larry Hinson: 71\n10. Bruce Devlin: 72\n\nJim Simons scored 71 in the first round. Now, I need to count how many players have a lower score (better) than 71.\n\nLooking at each player's first-round score:\n\n- Jack Nicklaus: 69 < 71 \u2192 better\n- Bobby Nichols: 69 < 71 \u2192 better\n- Lee Trevino: 70 < 71 \u2192 better\n- Jim Colbert: 69 < 71 \u2192 better\n\nWait, that's four players (Jack, Bobby, Lee, Jim) with scores lower than 71. The claim says \"more than 4,\" so we need at least five players.\n\nLooking further:\n\nGeorge Archer: 71 = 71 \u2192 same\nBob Erickson: 71 = 71 \u2192 same\nKen Still: 71 = 71 \u2192 same\nLarry Hinson: 71 = 71 \u2192 same\nBruce Devlin: 72 >71 \u2192 worse\n\nSo, only four players have better first-round scores than Jim Simons. The claim says \"more than 4,\" which would require five or more. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anyone. Are there any other players with first-round scores below 71?\n\nLooking again:\n\nJack Nicklaus:69\n\nBobby Nichols:69\n\nLee Trevino:70\n\nJim Colbert:69\n\nOthers are either 71 or higher.\n\nSo, four players in total. Therefore, the claim is false because it's not more than 4; it's exactly 4.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that more than four players scored better on the first round than Jim Simons (the eventual winner). From the table, only four players had a lower score than 71 in the first round. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_1_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_2_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_3_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_4_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_5_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"more than 3 golfer score under par on 3 separate round\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It says that more than three golfers scored under par in each of three separate rounds. Wait, no\u2014the wording might be a bit tricky. The phrase \"on 3 separate round\" could mean that each golfer had their scores under par in at least three different rounds across all the rounds played.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a player's performance over three rounds. Each player has a total score and a \"to par\" value which indicates how they performed relative to the par for the entire tournament or perhaps per round? Wait, actually, in golf, the \"to par\" is usually the cumulative result across all rounds. So, if a golfer has a \"to par\" of -3, that means their total score was 3 under par over all three rounds.\n\nBut the claim specifies that each golfer scored under par on each of three separate rounds. That would mean for each round (first, second, third), the golfer's score in that individual round was under par.\n\nLooking at the table, each player has their scores broken down into three rounds: Round 1, Round 2, and Round 3. For example, Jim Simons scored 71 + 71 + 65 = 207. The \"to par\" is -3, which means his total was 3 under par across all three rounds.\n\nBut the claim isn't about the cumulative score; it's about each individual round being under par. So I need to check for each player whether all three of their individual round scores were under par.\n\nIn golf, a round score under par would typically be less than the par for that specific round. However, since we don't have the exact par per round in this table, perhaps the \"to par\" column can help. If the golfer's total is under par, it suggests they performed well overall, but it doesn't necessarily mean each round was under par.\n\nWait, but looking at the claim again: \"more than 3 golfers score under par on 3 separate rounds.\" So, each of those more than three golfers must have had all three rounds under par.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- Jim Simons (Row 1): Scores are 71, 71, 65. To par is -3. If the total is under par, but individual rounds could be over or under. Without knowing the exact par per round, it's hard to say if each of his three rounds was under par.\n\n- Jack Nicklaus (Row 2): Scores are 69,72,68. To par -1. Again, total is under, but individual rounds might not all be under.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm misunderstanding the table structure. The \"to par\" column shows the overall result across all three rounds. So, for example, Jim Simons has a total score of 207, which is 3 under par (-3). But does that mean each round was under par? Not necessarily. He could have had some rounds over and some under.\n\nBut the claim is about each golfer having scored under par in three separate rounds. That would require each of their three individual scores to be under par for each round they played.\n\nSo, without knowing the exact par per round, it's challenging to verify if each score was under par. Alternatively, perhaps \"to par\" refers to each round? But that doesn't make sense because the \"to par\" is a single value.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the scores again. If a player's total is significantly under par, it might suggest that their individual rounds were also under. For instance:\n\n- Jim Simons: 71 +71+65=207 (-3). Suppose each round had a par of around 72. Then 71 would be 1 under per round (if the round's par was 72). But if each round's par is lower, say 70, then 71 would be over. Without knowing the exact par per round, I can't confirm.\n\nBut perhaps in golf tournaments, all rounds have the same par, so for example, each round might be 72. Then:\n\n- Jim Simons: 71 (1 under), 71 (1 under), 65 (7 under). So all three rounds would be under par. That makes his total -9? But wait, no\u2014his \"to par\" is only -3, so that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, that's a problem. If each round was 72, then:\n\n- Jim Simons: 71 (-1), 71 (-1), 65 (-7). Total would be -9, but his to par is only -3. That doesn't match. So perhaps the \"to par\" in the table refers to the total across all rounds.\n\nTherefore, each round's par might not be the same or known here. Without knowing per-round pars, it's impossible to determine if each individual round was under par for any golfer.\n\nGiven that, the claim can't be verified because we don't have enough information about each round's par. However, perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the \"to par\" is per round? No, that doesn't make sense because it's a single value for all three rounds.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe the claim refers to three separate golfers who each had at least one round under par in different tournaments or different rounds. But no, the table seems to represent a single tournament with three rounds.\n\nI'm getting confused here. Let me try another approach. The claim is about more than 3 golfers having scored under par on 3 separate rounds. Each golfer must have had all three of their rounds under par.\n\nLooking at the \"to par\" column, if a golfer's total is under par (-1 or -3), that doesn't necessarily mean each round was under. They could have some over and some under.\n\nSo without knowing per-round pars, I can't confirm individual round performances. Therefore, based on this table alone, we cannot verify whether any golfer had all three rounds under par. Hence, the claim is unverifiable with the given data.\n\nBut perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe \"scored under par\" refers to their total score being under, not each round. In that case, how many golfers have a total score under par?\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: -3 (under)\n- Row 2: -1 (under)\n- Rows 3 and beyond are cut off, but assuming similar.\n\nSo if more than three golfers have totals under par, then yes. But since only two rows are shown (Jim Simons and Jack Nicklaus), it's unclear how many others there are. The question didn't provide the entire table, so perhaps in reality, there are more entries.\n\nBut without knowing the total number of golfers who had a \"to par\" value under 0, I can't determine if it's more than three. Therefore, based on this information, we cannot confirm whether more than three golfers scored under par on their totals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about each golfer having at least one round under par in three separate rounds (i.e., different rounds for different players), but that seems less likely.\n\nGiven all this confusion and lack of data, I think the best approach is to state that based on the provided information, it's not possible to determine whether more than three golfers scored under par on all three of their individual rounds.\n</think>\n\nThe task was to determine if more than three golfers scored under par on each of their three individual rounds in a tournament. However, without knowing the specific par for each round, it's impossible to verify whether each golfer's individual scores were under par. The provided data only shows cumulative \"to par\" values, which indicate overall performance but not per-round results. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot confirm whether more than three golfers met the criteria of scoring under par in all three rounds.\n\n**Answer:** Based on the available information, it is not possible to determine if more than three golfers scored under par on each of their three individual rounds.",
