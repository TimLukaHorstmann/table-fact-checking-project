    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the result of the 1990 world cup qualify competition be 1 - 0\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. There are five rows, each representing a different match with details like date, venue, score, result, and competition. The claim is about the result of the 1990 World Cup qualify competition, so I need to find which row corresponds to that competition.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Competition is 1986 World Cup qualifying.\n- Row 2: Competition is 1990 World Cup qualifying. This seems relevant because it's about qualifying for the 1990 World Cup.\n- Row 3: It's a friendly competition, not related to the claim.\n- Row 4: Competition is the 1990 World Cup itself, not the qualifier.\n- Row 5: Another friendly match.\n\nSo the relevant row here is Row 2. Now, in that row, the result is listed as 1 - 0. The claim states that the result was 1 - 0, which matches exactly with what's in the table for the 1990 World Cup qualifying competition.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the relevant cell shows a result of 1-0 for the specified competition.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"the score of the match in torrance , california be 1 - 0\".\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions a match that took place in Torrance, California, and it claims the score was 1-0.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are five rows. Each row has details about different matches, including date, venue, score, result, and competition.\n\nI'll go through each row to find any that mention Torrance, California as the venue.\n\nRow 1: Venue is Torrance, California. The score here is listed as 1-0. That seems to match the claim exactly.\n\nRows 2-5 don't have Torrance, California as their venues, so they can be disregarded for this specific claim.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cell is in Row 1 under the 'score' column. Since the score there is indeed 1-0, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the match held in Torrance, California (Row 1) has a score of 1-0 as stated.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"the 1990 world cup competition be hold at a venue in tampa florida.\" First, I need to break down what exactly this claim is saying.\n\nThe key points here are:\n1. The event is the 1990 World Cup competition.\n2. It was held at a venue in Tampa, Florida.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, each row contains information about different matches or competitions. Let's go through each row to see if any of them mention the 1990 World Cup and if it took place in Tampa, Florida.\n\nStarting with Row 1: It mentions the 1986 World Cup qualifying on May 19, 1985, at Torrance, California. So that's a different year (1986 instead of 1990) and a different location, so this row isn't relevant.\n\nRow 2 is about November 19, 1989, in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, for the 1990 World Cup qualifying. Again, it's qualifying, not the actual World Cup, and the venue is outside the US, so this doesn't support the claim.\n\nRow 3: March 10, 1990, in Tampa, Florida, with a friendly competition. Even though it's in Tampa, it's just a friendly match, not part of the World Cup. So this doesn't help either.\n\nRow 4 is June 10, 1990, in Florence, Italy, for the 1990 World Cup. This is the actual World Cup, but it took place in Italy, not Tampa, Florida. Therefore, this contradicts the claim.\n\nRow 5: May 28, 1995, in Tampa, Florida, another friendly match. Again, a different year and just a friendly game, so not relevant to the 1990 World Cup.\n\nPutting it all together, the only row that mentions the 1990 World Cup is Row 4, which was held in Italy, not Tampa, Florida. Therefore, there's no support for the claim that the 1990 World Cup was held in Tampa, Florida. In fact, the information shows that it wasn't.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the 1990 World Cup competition was held in Florence, Italy, as per Row 4.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the 1990 world cup qualify game hold in california be on november 19\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It seems like it's saying that a qualifying game for the 1990 World Cup was held in California on November 19th. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match with details about date, venue, score, result, and competition. My goal is to check if there's any row where the competition is \"1990 world cup qualifying\" or something similar, the venue includes California, and the date is November 19th.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Date is May 19, 1985. Venue is Torrance, California. The competition is \"1986 world cup qualifying\". So this is for a different World Cup year (1986) and the date doesn't match November 19.\n\nRow 2: Date is November 19, 1989. Venue is Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. Competition is \"1990 world cup qualifying\". The date matches the claim's November 19th, but the venue is in Trinidad and Tobago, not California. So this doesn't support the claim about California.\n\nRow 3: Date March 10, 1990. Venue Tampa, Florida. Competition friendly. Doesn't match the criteria at all.\n\nRow 4: June 10, 1990. Florence, Italy. Competition is \"1990 world cup\". This is a World Cup game but not a qualifying match and venue is in Italy, so no.\n\nRow 5: May 28, 1995. Tampa, Florida again. Friendly competition. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo looking at all rows, the only one that mentions \"1990 world cup qualifying\" is Row 2. However, its venue is not in California but in Trinidad and Tobago. Therefore, there's no row where both the competition is 1990 World Cup qualifying, the venue is in California, and the date is November 19th.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because while there was a qualifying game on November 19, it wasn't held in California.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is about a specific World Cup qualifier. Checking each row:\n\n- Row 2 has the correct competition (1990) and date (November 19), but the venue isn't in California.\n\nNo row matches all conditions, so answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
