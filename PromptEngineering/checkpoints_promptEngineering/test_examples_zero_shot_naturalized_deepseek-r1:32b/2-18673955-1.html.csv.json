    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"there be no game that be play on october 30  , 1977 that be list greater than week 7\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that there is no game played on October 30, 1977, listed in weeks beyond week 7.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find any games on October 30, 1977. Scanning the 'date' column, I see that row 7 has the date \"october 30 , 1977\". So this is the game in question.\n\nNow, checking the week number for this date. Row 7's week is 7. The claim mentions \"greater than week 7\", so we're looking to see if there are any games on October 30 that are listed in weeks higher than 7. \n\nIn row 7, the game was played on October 30, and it's in week 7. Since there are no other entries with that date, especially not in weeks 8 or beyond, there isn't a game on that date in any week higher than 7.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there's only one game on October 30, 1977, and it's in week 7.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
