The task is to determine whether the claim \"melbourne do not play as an away team on 31 july 1965\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the table represents. Each row in the table corresponds to a game played on the same date, July 31, 1965. The columns include home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nThe claim is about Melbourne not playing as an away team on that specific date. So, I need to check each row in the table for any instance where Melbourne is listed as the away team.\n\nLooking at Row 5 of the table: \n- Home team: Melbourne\n- Away team: Fitzroy\n\nHere, Melbourne is the home team, not the away team. The other rows (1 through 6) don't list Melbourne as the away team either. Each row has different teams as home and away, but none have Melbourne in the away team column.\n\nSince there's no row where Melbourne is the away team on July 31, 1965, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"richmond have an away team score 02 point higher than fitzroy do\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that Richmond's away team score is two points higher than Fitzroy's away team score. So, my goal is to find both Richmond and Fitzroy in the table as away teams and compare their scores.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- Row 4: Home team is St Kilda, away team is Richmond with a score of 11.17 (83). Wait, but here Richmond is the away team? Let me check again. Yes, in Row 4, Richmond is listed under \"away team\", and their score is 11.17 which equals 83 points.\n\n- Then, I need to find where Fitzroy is an away team. Looking through all rows:\n\nRow 5 shows that Melbourne is the home team, and Fitzroy is the away team with a score of 11.15 (81). So Fitzroy's score is 11.15, which totals 81 points.\n\nNow, according to the claim, Richmond's away score should be two points higher than Fitzroy's. Let's compare their total points:\n\nRichmond: 83 points\nFitzroy: 81 points\n\nThe difference between these two is 2 points (83 - 81 = 2). So, yes, Richmond scored exactly two points more than Fitzroy when both were away teams.\n\nI should also verify if there are any other instances where either team was an away team. Let me check all rows again to make sure there's no confusion:\n\n- Row 4: Richmond is the away team with 83.\n- Row 5: Fitzroy is the away team with 81.\n\nNo other rows have these teams as away teams, so this must be the correct comparison.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true. The relevant cells are in Row 4 and Row 5 where both Richmond and Fitzroy are listed as away teams with their respective scores.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Richmond's away score of 83 points is exactly two points higher than Fitzroy's 81 points.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. There are six rows, each representing a different game. Each row has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nThe claim is about the number of games played on 31 July 1965. So I need to check how many times this specific date appears in the 'date' column across all rows.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Date is 31 July 1965.\nRow 2: Date is 31 July 1965.\nRow 3: Date is 31 July 1965.\nRow 4: Date is 31 July 1965.\nRow 5: Date is 31 July 1965.\nRow 6: Date is 31 July 1965.\n\nSo, all six rows have the same date. That means there are exactly six games listed with that date.\n\nThe claim says \"a total of 6 game\" which seems to mean six games. The slight typo in 'game' (plural vs singular) doesn't affect the meaning; it's clear they're referring to games in plural. \n\nSince all six rows match the specified date, the claim is correct. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, regarding relevant cells: I need to list each cell that contains the date 31 July 1965. Each row has a 'date' column where this appears, so the relevant cells are each of these six rows under the 'date' column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because all six games listed in the table took place on 31 July 1965.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"the game play at mcg be 1 of 2 game that have a crowd size larger than 30000\"\n\nFirst, I should check which games were played at the MCG. Looking through each row:\n\n- Row 5 mentions venue as 'mcg'. So that's one game.\n\nNext, I need to find out if there are exactly two games with a crowd size over 30,000. Let me examine the 'crowd' column for each row:\n\nRow 1: 19658 \u2192 less than 30k\nRow 2: 16800 \u2192 less than 30k\nRow 3: 20744 \u2192 less than 30k\nRow 4: 34076 \u2192 more than 30k\nRow 5: 30381 \u2192 more than 30k\nRow 6: 18500 \u2192 less than 30k\n\nSo, rows 4 and 5 have crowds over 30,000.

Let me start by carefully reading through the table and understanding each row.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has details about a game played on July 31, 1965. Each row includes the home team, their score, away team, their score, venue, crowd number, and date. The claim is specifically about Essendon playing as an away team on that particular date.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row one by one to check if Essendon is mentioned as an away team in any of them.\n\nRow 1: Home team is Geelong, away team is North Melbourne. No Essendon here.\nRow 2: Here, the home team is Essendon, and the away team is Footscray. So in this case, Essendon is the home team, not the away team. The claim says they're playing as an away team, so this doesn't support it.\nRow 3: Home team is Carlton, away team is South Melbourne. No Essendon involved here.\nRow 4: Home team is St Kilda, away team is Richmond. Again, no Essendon mentioned.\nRow 5: Home team is Melbourne, away team is Fitzroy. No Essendon here either.\nRow 6: Home team is Hawthorn, away team is Collingwood. Still no Essendon.\n\nAfter checking all six rows, the only mention of Essendon is in Row 2 as the home team against Footscray. There's no row where Essendon appears as an away team on July 31, 1965.

The claim compares two teams: Richmond and Footscray. It states that Richmond's away team score is higher than Footscray's. \n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the rows where these two teams are listed as away teams because the claim is about their scores when they're away.\n\nStarting with Row 1:\n- Home team: Geelong\n- Away team: North Melbourne\nNeither Richmond nor Footscray are in this row, so it's not relevant.\n\nRow 2:\n- Home team: Essendon\n- Away team: Footscray\nHere, Footscray is the away team.

But that's reversed; the claim says the home team should have 11.15 (81), but in this case, the home team has 12.11 and the away has 11.15.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The claim is that the home team's score is 11.15 (81). Looking through all rows:\n\nRow 5: Home team Melbourne - 12.11 (83)\nAway team Fitzroy - 11.15 (81)\n\nSo in Row 5, the away team has 11.15 (81), but we need a row where the home team has that score.\n\nLooking at all rows again, none of them have the home team scoring 11.15 (81). The closest is Row 6, where the away team Collingwood scored 12.22 (94), and the home team Hawthorn scored 8.12 (60). So there's no row where the home team has 11.15 (81).\n\nTherefore, the claim can't be true because such a game doesn't exist in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies that the away team score is 8.12 (60) at a game where the home team scored 11.15 (81). However, reviewing each row:\n\n- No home team in any row has a score of 11.15 (81).\n- The away team Collingwood in Row 6 has a score of 12.22 (94), not 8.12.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because there's no game where the home team scored 11.15 (81).\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
