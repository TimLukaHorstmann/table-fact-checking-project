    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"laurent boutonnat do 8 remixes of the song throughout the year 1995\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that Laurent Boutonnat did eight remixes in the year 1995. To verify this, I'll need to look through each row of the table and count how many times Laurent Boutonnat is listed as a remixer for entries from 1995.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 15 rows. The columns we're concerned with are \"version\", \"remixed by\", and \"year\". I'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Year is 1995, but remixed by is empty. So Laurent isn't involved here.\n\nRow 2: Year 1995, remixed by Laurent Boutonnat. That's one.\n\nRow 3: 1995, remixed by both Laurent and Bertrand Chtenet. This counts as Laurent did a remix here. Second one.\n\nRow 4: Same year, same remixers. Third.\n\nRow 5: Again, same pair. Fourth.\n\nRow 6: Both again. Fifth.\n\nRow 7: Both again. Sixth.\n\nRow 8: Both again. Seventh.\n\nRow 9: Both again. Eighth.\n\nRows 10 to 15 are either from different years (like 1996 or 2003) or have other remixers. So those don't count towards the 1995 total.\n\nWait, but in row 10, the year is 1995 but remixed by is empty, so no.\n\nSo from rows 2 to 9 (rows 2 through 9 inclusive), that's 8 entries where Laurent Boutonnat is a remixer in 1995. So yes, he did 8 remixes in that year.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check: rows 2-9 are 8 rows? Let's count:\n\nRow 2: yes\n\nRow3: yes\n\nRow4: yes\n\nRow5: yes\n\nRow6: yes\n\nRow7: yes\n\nRow8: yes\n\nRow9: yes\n\nThat's 8 rows. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, compiling the relevant cells. Each of these rows (2-9) has 'remixed by' as Laurent or with him. So for each row, we note that column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by 8 entries where Laurent Boutonnat remixed in 1995.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"bertrand chtenet laurent boutonnat with 7 of the remixes in the year 1995\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that both Bertrand Chtenent and Laurent Boutonnat are involved in 7 remixes released in 1995. So I need to check two things: how many remix entries from 1995 have both of these individuals as remixed by, and whether that count is exactly 7.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different version or remix of a track. The columns include 'version', 'length', 'album', 'remixed by', and 'year'. I'm particularly interested in rows where the year is 1995 and the remixed by field includes both Bertrand Chtenent and Laurent Boutonnat.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Year is 1995. Remixed by is empty, so neither of them are involved here.\nRow 2: Year is 1995. Remixed by only Laurent Boutonnat. Bertrand isn't listed here, so this doesn't count.\nRow 3: Year is 1995. Both remixed by are present: Laurent and Bertrand. So this counts as one.\nRow 4: Year is 1995. Again, both are listed. That's two.\nRow 5: Same here, both are there. Now we're at three.\nRow 6: Both again, so four.\nRow 7: Both remixed by, making it five.\nRow 8: Both names are present here as well. Six now.\nRow 9: Year is 1995 and both are listed. That's seven.\n\nRows 10 to 15 have different years or don't include both remixers.\n\nSo adding up the rows from 3 to 9 where both are involved, that's a total of 7 remixes in 1995. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It's stating that there are live versions of the song recorded in both 2006 and 2009.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 13: version is \"jxl remix\", year 2003\u2014doesn't match.\nRow 14: version is \"live version (recorded in 2006)\", so that's one occurrence. Year is 2006 as per the claim.\nRow 15: version is \"live version (recorded in 2009)\", which matches the other part of the claim, year is 2009.\n\nSo both years mentioned in the claim are covered by rows 14 and 15.

The claim says: \"the new remix edit and the single dance mix be both 4 minute and 25 second long.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is stating. It mentions two versions: \"new remix edit\" and \"single dance mix.\" For each of these, the length should be 4 minutes and 25 seconds, which is 4:25 in the format shown in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see multiple rows with different versions. My task is to find the relevant rows for both \"new remix edit\" and \"single dance mix.\"\n\nStarting with \"new remix edit,\" I'll scan through each row's version column. Row 6 has \"new remix edit.\" Let me check its length: it says 4:25, which matches the claim.\n\nNext, I need to find \"single dance mix.\" Scanning the versions again, Row 7 is labeled as \"single dance mix.\" Its length is also 4:25. So both of these versions have the same duration mentioned in the claim.\n\nNow, to ensure there are no other entries that could affect this conclusion, I'll quickly check if there's another version with the same name but a different length. For example, \"new remix edit\" appears again in Row 8 as \"new remix edit (Germany),\" which is 4:43 long, but since the claim specifically refers to \"new remix edit,\" not the German one, it doesn't affect our current assessment.\n\nTherefore, both the \"new remix edit\" and \"single dance mix\" versions are indeed 4 minutes and 25 seconds long. This means the claim is fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that two specific versions have a length of 4:25.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine if the claim \"Laurent Boutonnat did more than 8 remixes of the song throughout the year 1995\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each part of the claim means. The claim states that Laurent Boutonnat was involved in more than eight remixes of a particular song in 1995. So, I need to look through the table and count how many times Laurent Boutonnat is listed as having remixed the song in that specific year.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents different versions of the song with various details like version type, length, album, remixer(s), and year. The columns are \"version,\" \"length,\" \"album,\" \"remixed by,\" and \"year.\"\n\nMy approach will be to go through each row, check if the year is 1995, and then see who was involved in the remixing process for that version. If Laurent Boutonnat is listed as one of the remixer(s), I'll count that version towards his total.\n\nI'll start from Row 1 and move downwards:\n\n- **Row 1**: Year is 1995, but \"remixed by\" is empty. So, no remixers here. Not counted.\n  \n- **Row 2**: Year is 1995, remixed by Laurent Boutonnat. That's one.\n\n- **Row 3**: Year 1995, remixed by both Laurent Boutonnat and Bertrand Ch\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0442. Even though there are two people, each remix counts as a separate version, so this adds another one for Laurent.\n\nWait, actually, each row represents a different version of the song, regardless of how many remixer names are in that cell. So, even if multiple people are involved in a single version's remixing, it still counts as one remix credit per person? Or does each version count once towards their total?\n\nI think for this context, each version is a separate remix effort, and if Laurent Boutonnat is part of any remix team for that version, it counts as him contributing to that remix. So, even if he worked with someone else on a version, each row where his name appears in \"remixed by\" is a separate remix credit.\n\nSo, moving forward:\n\n- **Row 2**: Laurent Boutonnat \u2192 1\n- **Row 3**: Both Laurent and Bertrand \u2192 Laurent counts here as well. Total now 2.\n- **Row 4**: Same as above. Laurent involved again. Total 3.\n- **Row 5**: Again, both. So, total 4.\n- **Row 6**: Both \u2192 total 5.\n- **Row 7**: Both \u2192 total 6.\n- **Row 8**: Both \u2192 total 7.\n- **Row 9**: Both \u2192 total 8.\n  \nNow, checking if any other rows in 1995 have Laurent Boutonnat:\n\n- **Row 10**: Year is 1995, but \"remixed by\" is empty. So, no.\n  \nSo from Rows 2 to 9 (8 rows), Laurent Boutonnat is listed as a remixer each time. That's eight remixes.\n\nWait, the claim says \"more than 8,\" so if he did exactly eight, that wouldn't satisfy the claim. Therefore, the answer would be FALSE because it's not more than eight; it's equal to eight.\n\nBut let me double-check to ensure I haven't missed any rows or made a miscalculation:\n\n- Rows 2: 1\n- Row3: 2\n- Row4:3\n- Row5:4\n- Row6:5\n- Row7:6\n- Row8:7\n- Row9:8\n\nThat's eight. So, he did exactly eight remixes in 1995.\n\nWait, but let me check if any of these rows have Laurent Boutonnat alone or with someone else. The count is per row where his name appears in \"remixed by.\" Each version is a separate remix, regardless of how many people worked on it. So each of those eight rows counts as one remix that he was involved in.\n\nTherefore, the total is exactly eight, not more than eight. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Laurent Boutonnat contributed to 8 remixes of the song in 1995. Since the claim states \"more than 8,\" it's false because he did exactly 8.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Each of these has both Bertrand and Laurent in the 'remixed by' column for 1995. Let me count them: row3 is first, then rows4-9 make it 7 total.\n\nSo that's seven remixes where both are involved. The claim says \"less than 7\", so if there are exactly seven, that would make the claim false because seven is not less than seven.\n\nWait, but let me double-check:\n\nRow3: yes\nRow4: yes\nRow5: yes\nRow6: yes\nRow7: yes\nRow8: yes\nRow9: yes\n\nThat's 7 rows where both are remixed.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions a live version of a song that was recorded before 2006. So I'm looking for any rows in the table where the version is a live version and the year is earlier than 2006.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple versions listed, including several live versions. Let me check each row to see if it fits these criteria.\n\nRow 1: Not a live version.\nRow 2: Single version, not live.\nRows 3-7: Various remixes and edits, no live versions here.\nRow 8: New remix edit (Germany), still not live.\nRow 9: German radio edit, again not live.\nRow 10: Music video, so that's different.\nRow 11: UK Remix, nope.\nRow 12: Live version recorded in 1996. That's definitely before 2006. So this row is relevant.\nRow 13: JXL remix, not live.\nRows 14 and 15 are live versions from 2006 and 2009 respectively, which are after or exactly in 2006.\n\nSo the only live version recorded before 2006 is Row 12. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because there's at least one live version (from 1996) that meets the condition.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"version\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"2 remixes of the song be release after 2003 by richard dekkard and junkie xl respectively.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what needs to be verified. The claim mentions two remixers: Richard Dekkard and Junkie XL, each releasing a remix after 2003.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find entries where the remixer is either Richard Dekkard or Junkie XL and check if their release years are after 2003.\n\nStarting with Row 1: The remixer is '-', so not relevant. Rows 2-8 also have remixers as Laurent Boutonnat, Bertrand Chtenet, etc., but none of them are Richard Dekkard or Junkie XL. \n\nRow 9: Remixed by Laurent and Bertrand again, same as before.\n\nRow 10: Remixer is '-', not relevant.\n\nRow 11: Here's Richard Dekkard as the remixer. The year is 1996, which is before 2003. So this doesn't fit the claim.\n\nRow 12: Remixer is '-', so no.\n\nRows 13-15: Row 13 has Junkie XL as the remixer with a release year of 2003. The claim says \"after 2003,\" so 2003 doesn't count. Rows 14 and 15 have no remixer specified, so they're irrelevant.\n\nSo Richard Dekkard's remix in Row 11 is before 2003, and Junkie XL's remix in Row 13 is exactly in 2003, which isn't after. Therefore, the claim that two remixes were released after 2003 by these two individuals isn't supported by the table.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the new remix edit and the single dance mix be both longer than 5 minute\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table to identify the relevant rows for each version mentioned in the claim: \"new remix edit\" and \"single dance mix.\"\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For \"new remix edit,\" I scan through the rows until I find a row where the 'version' is exactly that. It appears in Row 6: version is \"new remix edit,\" length is 4:25, year 1995.\n  \n- Next, for \"single dance mix,\" I search again and find it in Row 7: version is \"single dance mix,\" length is 4:25, year 1995.\n\nNow, both versions have a length of 4 minutes and 25 seconds. The claim states that both should be longer than 5 minutes. Since 4:25 is less than 5 minutes, the claim isn't supported by the data in the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE, as neither version meets the 5-minute threshold.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"length\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"length\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
