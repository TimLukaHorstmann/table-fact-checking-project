    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says, \"94% of ablett's game be play with geelong, with the rest on gold coast.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is stating. It seems like it's saying that 94% of Ablitt's games were played for Geelong, and the remaining 6% (since 100 - 94 = 6) were for Gold Coast.\n\nLooking at the table, I see multiple rows with different seasons. The relevant information is in the 'team' and 'games' columns. \n\nIn row 1: team is Geelong, games: 4\nRow 2: Geelong, games:7\nRow3: Geelong, games:21\nRow5: Gold Coast, games:2\n\nI should sum up all the games for each team.\n\nFor Geelong:\nRow1:4 + Row2:7 + Row3:21 = Total of 32 games.\n\nGold Coast has only row5 with 2 games.\n\nThen, there's a row6 which is career totals. It says 'games: 34'. That makes sense because 4+7+21+2=34. So total games are 34.\n\nNow, checking the claim: 94% of 34 games should be approximately how much? Let's calculate:\n\n94% of 34 = 0.94 *34 \u224831.96, which rounds to about 32 games. \n\nAnd indeed, Geelong has 32 games (rows 1-3), and Gold Coast has 2 games in row5. So the claim that 94% of his games were with Geelong and the rest with Gold Coast is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are all the 'games' under each team.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data as the total games for Geelong (32) and Gold Coast (2) add up to 34, which matches the career total. The percentage breakdown aligns with the numbers provided.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n     {\"row_1\": 1, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n     {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n     {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\": \"games\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user has provided a table with data about Nathan Ablitt's performance over different seasons and teams. The claim is that he played for Geelong for 4 years before switching to Gold Coast. My task is to determine if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It has multiple rows, each representing a season from 2005 onwards, plus a career totals row. Each row includes details like team, games played, disposals, kicks, etc. The relevant information for this claim is the team and the seasons.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Season 2005, Team Geelong\n- Row 2: Season 2006, Team Geelong\n- Row 3: Season 2007, Team Geelong\n- Row 4: Season 2008, Team is empty (maybe not played or data missing)\n- Row 5: Season 2011, Team Gold Coast\n\nWait a minute, the claim says he played for Geelong for four years before switching. Let's count the seasons with Geelong:\n\nSeasons 2005, 2006, and 2007 are clearly with Geelong\u2014three seasons. There's no data for 2008 (Row 4 has all dashes), so it's unclear if he played in 2008 or not. The next season after that is 2011 with Gold Coast.\n\nSo, the claim mentions four years with Geelong, but from the table, we only see three seasons with Geelong. Unless 2004 was also a season, which isn't included here. Alternatively, maybe 2008 was considered part of his time with Geelong even without data? But that's speculative.\n\nAdditionally, between 2007 and 2011, there are missing seasons (2009 and 2010). It's possible he didn't play for Geelong in those years or maybe played elsewhere. The career totals row shows games across all teams as 34, but that doesn't specify when each team was active.\n\nGiven the information in the table, it only supports three seasons with Geelong before moving to Gold Coast in 2011. Therefore, the claim of four years isn't fully supported by the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states Nathan Ablitt played for Geelong for four years before switching to Gold Coast. The table shows he was with Geelong from 2005 to 2007 (three seasons). There's no information about 2008, but without it, the claim of four consecutive years isn't validated.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"Ablett have 164 more disposal between his record in 2005 and 2007\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions \"disposal,\" which I think refers to \"disposals.\" So the claim is about the difference in disposals between Ablett's 2005 and 2007 seasons being 164 more. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a season with various statistics for Geelong or Gold Coast teams. The rows are indexed from 0 to 5, but I'm focusing on rows where the team is Geelong because that's likely Ablett's team during those years.\n\nRow 1 (index 0) is for 2005: disposals are listed as 27.\nRow 3 (index 2) is for 2007: disposals are listed as 191.\n\nWait, the claim says \"between his record in 2005 and 2007.\" So I need to calculate the difference between these two seasons. \n\nCalculating the difference: 191 (2007) minus 27 (2005) equals 164. That matches exactly what the claim is stating.\n\nNow, I should also check if there are any other relevant cells or potential issues. The table shows that in 2006, he played more games but the disposals for that year aren't part of this calculation since the claim only mentions 2005 and 2007. Also, row 4 (2008) has all cells as '-', which might mean he didn't play or the data isn't available, but it doesn't affect this particular claim.\n\nThe career totals are in row 5 (index 4), which sum up his stats across seasons, including 2005, 2006, and 2007. However, since the claim is about two specific years, I don't need to consider the career totals here.\n\nI think that's all the necessary information. The relevant cells are the disposals for 2005 (row 0) and 2007 (row 2). Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe difference in disposals between 2005 and 2007 is exactly 164, supporting the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"disposals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"disposals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"nathan ablett score less goal in 2006 than he do in 2005.\" So, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has multiple rows, each representing a season from 2005 to 2011 and a career total. Each row includes various statistics like games, disposals, kicks, handballs, marks, tackles, goals, behinds, etc.\n\nThe claim is about Nathan Ablitt's goals in two seasons: 2005 and 2006. I need to compare his goal totals for these years to see if he scored fewer goals in 2006 than in 2005.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For 2005 (Row 1), under \"goals,\" it's listed as 8 (2.0). So, Nathan Ablitt scored 8 goals in the 2005 season.\n- For 2006 (Row 2), the \"goals\" column shows 4 (0.6). That means he scored 4 goals in the 2006 season.\n\nComparing these two numbers: 8 goals in 2005 versus 4 goals in 2006. It's clear that 4 is less than 8, so the claim holds true.\n\nI should also make sure there are no other rows or columns I'm missing. The table doesn't have any other data for Nathan Ablitt beyond these years relevant to this claim. Also, checking for typos or misinterpretations: \"nathan ablett\" is correctly spelled in lowercase, but the table uses uppercase letters; however, it's the same person, so that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nSo, based on the data provided, the claim that Nathan Ablitt scored fewer goals in 2006 than in 2005 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim compares Nathan Ablitt's goal totals for the 2005 and 2006 seasons. According to the table, he scored 8 goals in 2005 and 4 goals in 2006. Since 4 is less than 8, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about Nathan Ablett's best year for points with Geelong is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"Across all his years on Geelong, Nathan Ablett's best year for points was 2007.\" So I need to check the points he scored each season he played with Geelong and see if 2007 was indeed his highest.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several rows. Let me identify which ones correspond to Nathan playing for Geelong.\n\nRow 1: Season 2005, Team Geelong.\nRow 2: Season 2006, Team Geelong.\nRow 3: Season 2007, Team Geelong.\nRow 4: Season 2008, Team Geelong. But all the stats here are '-', which probably means he didn't play or there's no data available for that season.\nRow 5: Season 2011, Team Gold Coast. So this is not relevant since it's a different team.\nRow 6: Career totals across all teams.\n\nSo the relevant rows for Geelong are 2005 (row1), 2006 (row2), 2007 (row3), and maybe 2008 (row4, but no data). \n\nNow, I need to check what points mean. In Australian rules football, points can refer to total points scored by a player, which is typically goals multiplied by 6 plus behinds. However, looking at the table, there are separate columns for 'goals' and 'behinds', so maybe we should calculate total points as (goals * 6) + behinds.\n\nBut wait, I see that in each row, the stats are given with averages in parentheses. For example, in 2005: goals:8 (2.0). So 8 goals over 4 games gives an average of 2.0 per game. Similarly, behinds:2 (0.5) over 4 games.\n\nSo for each season, we can calculate total points as goals *6 + behinds.\n\nLet me compute this for each Geelong season:\n\n2005:\nGoals:8\nBehind:2\nTotal points = 8*6 +2 = 48+2=50\n\n2006:\nGoals:4\nBehinds:3\nTotal points =4*6 +3=24+3=27\n\n2007:\nGoals:34\nBehinds:18\nTotal points=34*6 +18=204+18=222\n\n2008: Data is '-', so we can ignore or assume he didn't play.\n\nCareer totals are in row6, but since that's across all teams including Gold Coast, it's not relevant here.\n\nNow comparing the points:\n\n2005: 50\n2006:27\n2007:222\n\nClearly, 2007 has the highest points among these seasons. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nWait, but in row3 for 2007, goals are 34 and behinds 18. Let me double-check:\n\n34*6=204 +18=222. That's correct.\n\nAre there any other years? 2008 has no data, so it's likely he didn't play or the stats aren't available. So among the seasons with data, 2007 is his best year for points while at Geelong.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Nathan Ablett had his best year for points in 2007 while playing for Geelong. By calculating the total points for each season using goals and behinds, we find that 2007 indeed has the highest points. Therefore, the answer is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"85% of Ablitt's games were played with Geelong, with the rest with Gold Coast.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table represents. It seems to be a record of a player's performance across different seasons and teams. Each row corresponds to a season or a career total, showing statistics like games played, disposals, kicks, etc.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Rows 1, 2, 3, and 5 are for specific seasons with Geelong (rows 1-3) and Gold Coast (row 5). Row 4 is 2008, but all data is missing. Row 6 shows career totals across all teams.\n\nThe claim is about the percentage of games played for each team. So, I need to find out how many games Ablitt played with Geelong versus Gold Coast.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- For Geelong (rows 1-3 and row 6):\n  - Season 2005: 4 games\n  - Season 2006: 7 games\n  - Season 2007: 21 games\n  - Career totals: 34 games\n\nWait, but the career total is 34 games. Let me check each season's games and sum them up to see if they match the career totals.\n\nSumming up Geelong seasons:\n2005: 4\n2006:7 (total so far 11)\n2007:21 (total 32)\n\nBut the career total is 34, which suggests that maybe there are two more games elsewhere. Looking at row 5, it's for Gold Coast in 2011 with 2 games.\n\nSo, adding up Geelong and Gold Coast:\n\nGeelong: 4 +7+21 =32\nGold Coast:2\n\nTotal games:32 +2=34, which matches the career total. So Ablitt played 32 games for Geelong and 2 games for Gold Coast.\n\nNow, let's calculate what percentage of 34 is 32:\n\n(32 /34) *100 \u224894.12%\n\nBut the claim says \"85%\", which is significantly lower than 94%. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because Ablitt actually played about 94% of his games with Geelong, not 85%.\n\nAdditionally, checking for any other teams: there's no data for 2008, but since career totals include all seasons, and only Gold Coast has another entry, that confirms it.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- For Geelong: rows 1,2,3 under \"games\" column\n- For Gold Coast: row5 under \"games\"\n- Career total: row6 under \"games\"\n\nThese show the breakdown of games for each team and confirm the totals.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"games\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Now, I need to find out if the difference between these two numbers is 150.\n\nSo, subtracting 27 from 191 gives me 164. Wait a minute, that's more than 150. So according to this calculation, the difference is actually higher than claimed. But wait, maybe I should check if there are any other rows involved or if I'm misinterpreting something.\n\nLooking again, the claim says \"between his record in 2005 and 2007.\" That probably means from 2005 up to and including 2007. But let me confirm the years: 2005 is just one year, 2006 is another row (Row 2), and 2007 is Row 3. So, maybe I should sum the disposals from both 2005 and 2006 to compare against 2007?\n\nLet me add up the disposals for 2005 and 2006: 27 (Row1) + 56 (Row2) = 83. Then, subtract that from 2007's 191. That gives 191 - 83 = 108. Hmm, still not reaching 150.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is considering the difference between 2007 and 2005 alone? So, 191 (Row3) minus 27 (Row1) equals 164, which as I calculated before. But the claim says \"150 more disposals,\" so is 164 considered as having 150 more? Since it's more than 150, does that make the claim true?\n\nBut wait, maybe the problem wants an exact difference of 150. If so, then since it's 164, which is higher than 150, perhaps the answer should still be TRUE because he has more than 150 disposals between those years.\n\nAlternatively, if \"between\" implies considering all seasons from 2005 to 2007 (including 2006), then the total increase would be from 2005's 27 to 2007's 191. That's an increase of 164, which is more than 150, so the claim holds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"between\" refers to comparing 2007 to the sum of previous years, but I think that's complicating it. The straightforward approach is to take the difference between 2007 and 2005 alone.\n\nSo, subtracting 2005's disposals (27) from 2007's (191), we get 164. Since 164 is more than 150, the claim is TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that I'm not missing any other rows or data points. Let me check all relevant cells again:\n\n- For 2005: disposals = 27\n- For 2007: disposals = 191\n\nYes, those are the only two rows needed for this calculation. The difference is indeed more than 150, so the claim holds.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the 'disposals' in both 2005 (Row1) and 2007 (Row3).\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Ablett had 150 more disposals between his records in 2005 and 2007. By examining the table, we find that in 2005 he had 27 disposals and in 2007 he had 191. The difference is 164, which exceeds 150, making the claim TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"disposals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"disposals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if Nathan Ablitt scored more goals in 2006 than he did in 2005 based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the relevant rows for the years 2005 and 2006. The claim is about comparing his goal statistics between these two seasons.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- For the 2005 season (Row 1), under the \"goals\" column, it's listed as 8. That seems straightforward.\n- Then for 2006 (Row 2), the goals are also listed as 4. \n\nSo comparing these two numbers: 8 in 2005 and 4 in 2006. The claim says he scored more in 2006 than in 2005, but according to the table, that's not the case. He actually scored fewer goals in 2006.\n\nI should make sure I'm looking at the right columns and rows. The \"goals\" column is clear, and the seasons are correctly identified as 2005 and 2006. There doesn't seem to be any missing data or other factors that could affect this comparison. \n\nTherefore, since 4 is less than 8, Nathan Ablitt did not score more goals in 2006 compared to 2005. The claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are the \"goals\" for both 2005 and 2006 seasons. Comparing these shows that Nathan scored fewer goals in 2006.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. The claim is about Nathan Ablitt's best year for points with Geelong being 2008. So first, I need to understand what the table shows.\n\nLooking at the table, it has data from seasons 2005 to 2011 and a career total row. Each season lists various statistics like games, disposals, kicks, handballs, marks, tackles, goals, behinds, etc., along with some numbers in parentheses which I assume are averages per game.\n\nThe claim mentions \"points,\" but the table doesn't have a 'points' column directly. In Australian rules football (assuming this is AFL), points can be calculated from goals and behinds. Goals are worth 6 points each, and behinds are 1 point each. So for each season, I should calculate total points by adding 6*goals + behinds.\n\nThe claim specifically refers to Nathan Ablitt's years with Geelong. Let me check which rows in the table belong to Geelong:\n\n- Row 1: 2005, Geelong\n- Row 2: 2006, Geelong\n- Row 3: 2007, Geelong\n- Row 4: 2008, Geelong (but all stats are '-')\n- Row 5: 2011, Gold Coast\n\nSo rows 1, 2, 3, and 4 are with Geelong. However, row 4 for 2008 has '-' in all columns except season and team. That means there's no data available for that year.\n\nNow, to check if 2008 was his best year for points, I need to compare points across 2005, 2006, 2007, and see if any of those had higher points than 2008. But since 2008's data is missing, we can't include it in the comparison. Therefore, the best year must be among 2005, 2006, or 2007.\n\nLet's calculate the points for each of those years:\n\n- 2005: Goals = 8, Behind = 2 \u2192 Points = (8 * 6) + 2 = 48 + 2 = 50\n- 2006: Goals = 4, Behind = 3 \u2192 Points = (4*6)+3=24+3=27\n- 2007: Goals =34, Behind=18 \u2192 Points=(34*6)+18=204 +18=222\n\nSo the points for each year are:\n\n2005: 50 points\n\n2006: 27 points\n\n2007: 222 points\n\nSince 2008 has no data, it can't be considered. Therefore, his best year with Geelong is actually 2007, not 2008.\n\nTherefore, the claim that 2008 was his best year for points is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the relevant data for 2008 is missing and Nathan Ablitt's highest point total in the available years with Geelong was in 2007.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
