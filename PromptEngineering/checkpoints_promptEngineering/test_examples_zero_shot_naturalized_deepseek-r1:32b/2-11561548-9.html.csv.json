The claim says: \"corn be 1 of 3 emulator that have a proprietary license, 2 of which run on windows.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse this statement step by step.\n\nThe main points are:\n1. There are three emulators with a proprietary license.\n2. Among these three, two run on Windows.\n3. Corn is one of those three.\n\nSo, let's start by identifying all the rows where the 'license' column is 'proprietary'. Looking through each row:\n\nRow 4: corn, system: Nintendo64, platform: windows, license: proprietary. So yes, this fits.\n\nRow 11: sixtyforce, current version: 0.9.7, system: nintendo64, platform: os x, license: proprietary. That's another one.\n\nRow 12: ultrahle, current version: 1.0.0, system: nintendo64, platform: windows, xbox, license: proprietary. Third emulator with a proprietary license.\n\nSo that gives us three emulators: corn, sixtyforce, and ultrahle.\n\nNow, the claim says two of these run on Windows. Let's check each:\n\n- Corn runs on Windows (Row 4).\n- Sixtyforce runs on os x (Row 11), not Windows.\n- UltraHLE runs on Windows and Xbox (Row 12).\n\nSo out of the three, corn and ultrahle run on Windows. That makes two emulators with proprietary licenses that run on Windows.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there are indeed three emulators with a proprietary license, two of which run on Windows, including corn.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as there are three emulators with proprietary licenses, and among them, two (corn and ultrahle) run on Windows.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_ cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"license\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"mupen64 run 1 more platform than any other emulator\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for all entries related to mupen64 in the table. From the naturalized format, I see:\n\n- Row 5: name: daedalusx64\nWait, no, that's not mupen64. Let me go through each row properly.\n\nLooking at each row:\n1. Row 1: name is 1964, platforms are windows and xbox.\n2. Row 2: 1964js, platform javascript.\n3. Row 3: cen64, platforms windows, os x, gnu/linux.\n4. Row 4: corn, platform windows.\n5. Row 5: daedalusx64, platforms windows and psp.\n6. Row 6: mupen64, current version 0.5.1, system nintendo 64, platforms windows, os x, gnu/linux, freebsd, qnx beos. So that's five platforms.\n7. Row 7: mupen64plus, version 2.0, platforms windows, os x, gnu/linux, freebsd. That's four platforms.\n8. Row 8: mupen64plus ae, version 2.3.5, platform android.\n9. Row 9: n64js, javascript.\n10. Row 10: project64, windows and xbox.\n11. Row 11: sixtyforce, os x.\n12. Row 12: ultrahle, windows and xbox.\n\nSo the mupen64 entries are row 6 and rows 7-8 are derivatives but not the original mupen64.\n\nNow, let's count platforms for each emulator:\n\n- mupen64 (row 6): platforms listed as windows, os x, gnu/linux, freebsd, qnx beos. That's five platforms.\n- daedalusx64: two platforms.\n- project64: two platforms.\n- ultrahle: two platforms.\n- sixtyforce: one platform.\n- mupen64plus: four platforms.\n- mupen64plus ae: one platform (android).\n- Others like 1964 have two, 1964js has one, cen64 has three.\n\nSo the highest number of platforms is five from mupen64. Now, does any other emulator have four? Yes, mupen64plus has four. So mupen64 runs on one more platform than the next highest, which is four. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because mupen64 has 5 platforms, and others have up to four.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that no other emulator has five or more. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 3: cen64 has three.\nRow 10: project64 has two.\nRow 7: mupen64plus has four.\nSo yes, mupen64 is the only one with five platforms.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.

For GPL v3, only Row 8 is listed as such.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any or count incorrectly. \n\nRows with GPL v2:\n- 1964 (Row1)\n- 1964js (Row2)\n- daedalusx64 (Row5)\n- mupen64 (Row6)\n- mupen64plus (Row7)\n- project64 (Row10)\n\nThat's six, yes.

The claim says: \"corn be 1 of 3 emulator that have a proprietary license and 1 of 2 which run on window , and also be compatible with javascript.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into three parts:\n\n1. corn is one of three emulators with a proprietary license.\n2. corn is one of two that run on Windows.\n3. corn is compatible with JavaScript.\n\nLet me check each part step by step.\n\nStarting with the first part: checking how many emulators have a proprietary license. I'll go through each row and note those with \"proprietary\" in the license column.\n\n- Row 4 (corn): Proprietary\n- Row 10 (sixtyforce): Proprietary\n- Row 11 (ultrahle): Proprietary\n\nSo, there are three emulators with a proprietary license. That matches the claim. corn is indeed one of them.\n\nNext, the second part: how many run on Windows. I'll look at each emulator's platform to see if it includes Windows.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 1 (1964): Windows\n- Row 5 (daedalusx64): Windows\n- Row 6 (mupen64): Windows\n- Row 7 (mupen64plus): Windows\n- Row 8 (mupen64plus ae): Android (no)\n- Row 10 (project64): Windows\n- Row 4 (corn): Windows\n\nWait, let me count again. The emulators with Windows as a platform are:\n\nRow 1: yes\nRow 5: yes\nRow 6: yes\nRow 7: yes\nRow 10: yes\nRow 4: corn is in row 4 and runs on Windows.\n\nSo that's six emulators running on Windows, not two. The claim says \"one of 2 which run on window.\" That doesn't match because there are more than two. So this part might be false.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the claim. It says corn is one of 3 with proprietary license and one of 2 that run on Windows. But according to my count, six emulators run on Windows, so corn isn't just one of two; there are more than two. So this part is incorrect.\n\nThird part: compatibility with JavaScript. I'll check the platform column for each emulator.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- Row 2 (1964js): JavaScript\n- Row 9 (n64js): JavaScript\n\nSo, only two emulators support JavaScript as a platform. The claim says corn is compatible with JavaScript, but looking at row 4, corn's platforms are Windows and it's proprietary. There's no mention of JavaScript in its platform list. So corn isn't compatible with JavaScript.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again:\n\nRow 2: name 1964js, system Nintendo 64, platform JavaScript\nRow 9: n64js, platform JavaScript\n\nSo only two emulators support JavaScript. The claim says corn is one of them, but row 4 (corn) doesn't have JavaScript in its platforms. Therefore, this part is also false.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- First condition: correct (3 proprietary licenses)\n- Second condition: incorrect (more than 2 run on Windows)\n- Third condition: incorrect (corn isn't compatible with JS)\n\nSo the claim has two parts that are false. Therefore, the overall answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"platform\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"mupen64 run 1 more platform than any other emulator, include javascript.\" I need to determine if this is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll identify which row corresponds to mupen64. Looking at the table:\n\n- Row 6: name: mupen64\n   - Platforms: windows, os x, gnu / linux, freebsd, qnx beos\n\nSo, mupen64 runs on 5 platforms.\n\nNext, I need to check all other emulators and count their platforms.

From the table, no. So while mupen64 has more platforms than others excluding javascript, including javascript would require it to have that platform as well, which it doesn't.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"only 3 emulators run on both windows and xbox, corn, daedalusx64, and mupen64.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down what the claim is saying. It claims that exactly three emulators support both Windows and Xbox platforms. Those three are specified as corn, daedalusx64, and mupen64.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table to check which emulators have both \"windows\" and \"xbox\" listed under the platform column.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Name is 1964. Platform includes windows and xbox. So this emulator runs on both. But it's not one of the three mentioned, so does that matter? The claim says only those three, but if there are more, then the claim would be false.\n\nRow 2: 1964js platform is javascript, so no.\n\nRow3: cen64 has windows, os x, gnu/linux. No xbox here.\n\nRow4: corn's platform is windows. So it only runs on windows, not xbox. Wait, but the claim says corn runs on both. Hmm, that might be a problem because if corn doesn't run on xbox, then the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Row 4 for corn has platform: windows. No xbox listed. So according to this, corn only runs on windows. That's conflicting with the claim which says it runs on both.\n\nRow5: daedalusx64. Platform is windows and psp. Wait, no xbox here either. Oh, so does that mean the claim is wrong? Because daedalusx64 isn't listed as running on xbox in this table.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check Row5 again. It says platform: windows, psp. So no xbox for daedalusx64. That's a problem because the claim includes it as running on both.\n\nRow6: mupen64 has platforms windows, os x, gnu/linux, freebsd, qnx beos. No xbox listed here either. Hmm, so according to this row, mupen64 doesn't run on xbox.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says these three are the only ones running on both, but looking at Row10: project64's platform is windows and xbox. So that would be another emulator supporting both platforms, which isn't mentioned in the claim. That would make the claim false because it lists only three, but actually there's a fourth.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\n- The claim mentions corn, daedalusx64, mupen64 as running on both windows and xbox.\n- Checking each:\n   - corn (Row4) runs only on windows. So the claim is incorrect here.\n   - daedalusx64 (Row5) doesn't run on xbox according to the table; it's on windows and psp.\n   - mupen64 (Row6) doesn't have xbox listed.\n\nBut wait, I also noticed that project64 in Row10 does run on both windows and xbox. So even if the claim's three were correct, there's at least one more emulator supporting both platforms, making the total more than three. Hence, the claim is false because it says only those three but actually, another exists.\n\nAdditionally, looking back, I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine each relevant row:\n\n- Row1: 1964 supports windows and xbox.\n- Row5: daedalusx64 supports windows and psp (not xbox).\n- Row6: mupen64 supports multiple platforms but not xbox.\n- Row10: project64 supports windows and xbox.\n\nSo, the emulators supporting both are 1964 and project64. That's two, which contradicts the claim of three. Moreover, the ones listed in the claim (corn, daedalusx64, mupen64) don't all support both platforms as per the table.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are from rows where platform includes both windows and xbox. Those would be Row1, Row5, Row6, and Row10 for checking.\n\nWait no, actually:\n\n- For 1964 (Row1): yes.\n- project64 (Row10): yes.\nOthers don't. So that's two emulators, but the claim says three, which are incorrect because corn doesn't run on xbox, daedalusx64 doesn't run on xbox, and mupen64 also doesn't. Therefore, the relevant cells would be for these rows where platform includes both windows and xbox.\n\nSo I think the answer should be FALSE because the claim is incorrect in stating that those three are the only ones, when actually 1964 and project64 are the correct ones.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the specified emulators do not all support both Windows and Xbox as per the table. Additionally, there's another emulator (project64) that does support both platforms but isn't mentioned in the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"platform\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "mupen64plus , android edition (ae) be the only emulator that run on android and javascript",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"mupen64plus , android edition (ae) be the only emulator that run on android and javascript.\" I need to verify if this claim is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. It states two things:\n\n1. mupen64plus AE runs on Android.\n2. It's the only emulator that runs on both Android and JavaScript.\n\nSo, I need to check two main points: does any other emulator besides mupen64plus AE run on Android? And does any other emulator besides it run on both Android and JavaScript?\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Let's identify all emulators running on Android. Scanning each row:\n  - Row 8: Name is mupen64plus, AE, runs on Android.\n  - Are there others? Looking through the \"platform\" column for other entries with Android. It seems only Row 8 mentions Android.\n\nNext, check if any emulator runs on both Android and JavaScript:\n\n- For JavaScript support:\n  - Rows 2: 1964js\n  - Row 9: n64js\n  These two run on JavaScript. Do they also run on Android?\n\nLooking at their platforms:\n- 1964js (Row 2) is only on JavaScript.\n- n64js (Row 9) is also only on JavaScript.\n\nSo, mupen64plus AE runs on Android and others don't. However, the claim says it's the only emulator that runs on both Android and JavaScript. Wait, but mupen64plus AE doesn't run on JavaScript; it runs on Android (Row 8). The other JavaScript emulators don't run on Android.\n\nTherefore, there is no emulator that runs on both Android and JavaScript except maybe if another row does, but looking back:\n\n- Row 2: platform is JavaScript\n- Row 9: platform is JavaScript\n\nNo others. So mupen64plus AE doesn't run on JavaScript; it's only on Android. Thus, the claim is incorrect because there are emulators running on JavaScript (1964js and n64js), but none run on both Android and JavaScript except perhaps if any other row does.\n\nWait, wait: mupen64plus AE runs on Android. Do any others run on Android? No. So the first part is true, but the second part claims it's the only one running on both Android and JavaScript, which isn't the case because no emulator in the table runs on both; each runs either on Android or JavaScript.\n\nWait, wait again: The claim says mupen64plus AE is the only emulator that runs on Android AND JavaScript. But looking at Row 8, it's only on Android. Rows 2 and 9 are on JavaScript but not on Android. So actually, there is no emulator in the table that runs on both Android and JavaScript except possibly if any other row does.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again:\n\nLooking for emulators with platforms including both Android and JavaScript.\n\nRow 8: Android only.\nRows 2 and 9: JavaScript only.\n\nNo rows have both Android and JavaScript in their platform column.\n\nSo the claim is that mupen64plus AE runs on Android (true) and is the only one that runs on both Android and JavaScript. But since no emulator runs on both, perhaps the claim is making a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the claim. It says \"run on android and javascript.\" Does it mean either/or or both? The wording is ambiguous, but likely meaning that they run on both platforms. So if mupen64plus AE runs on Android, and no other emulators run on both Android and JavaScript, then the second part of the claim would be true because there are no others running on both.\n\nWait, but in reality, mupen64plus AE only runs on Android, not on JavaScript. So it's not running on both; thus, the claim is incorrect because it says mupen64plus AE is the only one that can run on both platforms, which isn't true since it doesn't even run on JavaScript.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The claim states that mupen64plus AE is the only emulator running on Android and JavaScript. But looking at the table:\n\n- mupen64plus AE runs on Android (Row 8).\n- Are there any others running on Android? No.\n- For JavaScript, Rows 2 and 9 are present.\n\nSo the claim says it's the only one that runs on both. Since no emulator in the table runs on both, the claim is incorrect because mupen64plus AE doesn't run on JavaScript, so it can't be the only one running on both platforms since none do. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is asserting that it's the only one for each platform (only on Android and only on JavaScript), but that would require checking.\n\nWait, no: The claim is \"the only emulator that run on android and javascript.\" So if mupen64plus AE runs on Android and another runs on JavaScript, then mupen64plus AE isn't the only one for both. Therefore, the claim is false because there are other emulators running on JavaScript (Rows 2 and 9) and none run on both.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- Relevant cells: \n  - Row 8's platform (Android)\n  - Rows 2 and 9's platforms (JavaScript)\n\nSince mupen64plus AE runs only on Android, and others run on JavaScript but not on Android, the claim is incorrect because there are emulators running on JavaScript besides mupen64plus AE. Therefore, the answer is that the claim is false.\n\nWait, but the question was to determine whether the claim is correct or not based on the table, so we need to state if it's true or false.\n\nBut perhaps I should structure this step-by-step as per the user's instructions.\n</think>\n\nThe task involves verifying a claim about an emulator running on specific platforms. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Claim Analysis**: The claim states that \"mupen64plus AE is the only emulator that runs on both Android and JavaScript.\"\n\n2. **Data Extraction**:\n   - From the table, mupen64plus AE (Row 8) is listed under the platform \"Android.\"\n   - Emulators running on JavaScript are found in Rows 2 (\"1964js\") and Row 9 (\"n64js\").\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - No emulator in the table has both \"Android\" and \"JavaScript\" listed as platforms.\n   - mupen64plus AE only runs on Android, not JavaScript.\n   - Therefore, there are no emulators that run on both platforms.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The claim is false because mupen64plus AE does not run on both Android and JavaScript, nor is it the sole emulator for these platforms since others exist for JavaScript alone.\n\n**Answer**: False",
