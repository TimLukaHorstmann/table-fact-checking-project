    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"game 4 be on april 25\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. Each row represents a game with various details like date, team, score, etc. The claim specifically mentions \"game 4\" and its date. So my goal is to find the row corresponding to game number 4 and check the date in that row.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Game 1, April 18\n- Row 2: Game 2, April 20\n- Row 3: Game 3, April 23\n- Row 4: Game 4, April 25\n- Row 5: Game 5, April 28\n\nSo, game number 4 is in row index 3 (since rows start at 1, but the indices here are zero-based). The date for this game is April 25. Therefore, the claim matches exactly with what's in the table.\n\nI should also consider if there are any potential issues, like different formats or typos. In this case, both the claim and the table use \"april\" without capitalization, so that's consistent. There's no discrepancy in the day either; it's 25 for both.\n\nNo other rows have a game number 4 except row index 3. Therefore, there's only one relevant cell to check: the date of game 4.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"game 4 be on april 25\" is TRUE because row 4 (index 3) lists April 25 as its date.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"game 4.0 , series 1 - 4 be on april 25\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components:\n- Game number: 4.0 (which I assume refers to game 4)\n- Series status: 1 - 4\n- Date: April 25\n\nI'll check each part against the table rows.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game. Let's go through each relevant column for each row:\n\nRow 1:\n- Game: 1\n- Date: April 18\n- Series: 0 - 1\nThis doesn't match the claim since it's about game 1 and series is 0-1.\n\nRow 2:\n- Game: 2\n- Date: April 20\n- Series: 1 - 1\nAgain, not relevant to game 4 or the series mentioned.\n\nRow 3:\n- Game: 3\n- Date: April 23\n- Series: 1 - 2\nStill not matching. The series here is 1-2, which isn't 1-4.\n\nRow 4:\n- Game: 4\n- Date: April 25\n- Series: 1 - 3\nAh, the game number matches (game 4), and the date is indeed April 25. However, the series status in this row is 1-3, not 1-4 as claimed.\n\nRow 5:\n- Game: 5\n- Date: April 28\n- Series: 1 - 4\nThis matches the series status (1-4), but it's for game 5 on a different date. So the claim's combination of game number, series, and date doesn't align with any single row.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The claim says \"game 4.0\" which is likely referring to game 4. In the table, game 4 has a series status of 1-3 on April 25. So the series being 1-4 would be incorrect for game 4. Instead, in row 5 (game 5), the series becomes 1-4 but that's on April 28.\n\nSo the claim incorrectly states that on April 25 (which is game 4), the series was 1-4. According to the table, game 4 ended with a series of 1-3. Therefore, the claim is false because the series status doesn't match for that date and game number.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states the series status for game 4 on April 25.\n\n**Step-by-step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Claim Components:**\n   - Game: 4\n   - Series: 1-4\n   - Date: April 25\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Data in the Table:**\n   - Look for rows where `game` is 4 and `date` is April 25.\n\n3. **Analyze Row 4 (Game 4):**\n   - Game number matches.\n   - Date matches April 25.\n   - Series status is listed as 1-3, not 1-4.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The series status in the claim does not match the table's data for game 4 on April 25.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"series\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"game 4 have a location attendance of at&t center 20491 and the series be 1 - 1.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for game 4 in the table. Scanning through the rows, row 4 corresponds to game 4.\n\nNow, checking the location attendance for game 4: The cell says \"american airlines center 20829.\" So, that's different from what the claim mentions, which is \"at&att center 20491.\"\n\nNext, I'll check the series status. In row 4, under the 'series' column, it shows \"1 - 3.\" The claim says the series should be \"1 - 1,\" so that's also incorrect.\n\nSince both parts of the claim (location attendance and series score) don't match the data in the table for game 4, the overall claim is false. The relevant cells are row 4, columns 'location attendance' and 'series'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"series\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
