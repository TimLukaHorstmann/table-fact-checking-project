I need to determine whether the claim \"edgar michalowski play men's single, 3 time at the czechoslovakian international\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asserting. The claim states that Edgar Michalowski played in the men's singles category three times at the Czechoslovakian International event. So, my task is to check if there are exactly three entries for Edgar Michalowski in the men's singles column of this specific event.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year from 1984 to 1992.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"monika cassens play women 's single , at the czechoslovakian international , 4 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim carefully. It seems a bit unclear, but from what I understand, it's stating that Monika Cassens played in the women's singles category four times at the Czechoslovakian International event.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents an international tournament with various columns like \"men's singles\", \"women's singles\", etc. The claim mentions Monika Cassens specifically in the women's singles, so I should focus on that column across all rows to see how many times she appears.\n\nStarting from row 0 (1984) up to row 20 (1992), I'll go through each year and check the \"women's singles\" column:\n\n- **Row 3 (1985)**: Women's Singles is Grethe Mogensen.\n- **Row 7 (1989)**: Women's Singles is Viktoria Pron.\n- **Row 10 (1992)**: Women's Singles is Irina Serova.\n\nWait, I might have missed some rows. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking again from row 0 to row 20:\n- Monika Cassens appears in the women's singles at row 7 (1989), but that's only once according to the data provided. There are no other entries for her in the women's singles across the years listed.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions \"Czechoslovakian International,\" but the table doesn't specify the country or name of each tournament; it just lists each year from 1984 to 1992. Without knowing which of these tournaments is the Czechoslovakian International, I can't verify the location aspect.\n\nGiven that Monika Cassens only appears once in the women's singles and there's no information about the event being held in Czechoslovakia, the claim isn't fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Monika Cassens played women's singles four times at the Czechoslovakian International. However, based on the table:\n\n- Monika Cassens is listed once in women's singles (row 7).\n- The table doesn't provide information about the event being held in Czechoslovakia.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by the data.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"women's singles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"edgar michalowski and monika cassens team up 3 years, 1975, 1980, 1981 in the mixed double category.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse each part of the claim. It mentions three specific years: 1975, 1980, and 1981. For each year, I need to check if Edgar Michalowski and Monika Cassens were partners in the mixed doubles category.\n\nI'll go through each year one by one:\n\n1. **Year 1975:**\n   - Looking at row 4 (since rows are 0-indexed), which corresponds to 1975.\n   - The relevant column is \"mixed double.\"\n   - The entry is \"erfried michalowsky petra michalowsky.\" \n   - This does not include Edgar Michalowski or Monika Cassens. So, the claim for 1975 is incorrect.\n\n2. **Year 1980:**\n   - Row 8 corresponds to 1980.\n   - The mixed doubles entry is \"erfried michalowsky petra michalowsky.\"\n   - Again, neither Edgar nor Monika are listed here.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"edgar michalowski play in 2 category , men's single and mixed double\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break down the steps.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that Edgar Michalowski participated in two categories: Men's Singles and Mixed Doubles. So, my task is to check if he indeed played in both of these categories in any year within the provided data.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a year from 1984 to 1992, with columns for Men's Singles, Women's Singles, Men's Doubles, Women's Doubles, and Mixed Doubles. My goal is to find rows where Edgar Michalowski appears in both Men's Singles and Mixed Doubles.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row for his name in the Men's Singles column. \n\n- In 1984 (Row 13), the Men's Singles player is Kim Brodersen, so no.\n- Moving to Row 15 (1986), Men's Singles is Andrey Antropov. Not him.\n- Looking at Row 17 (1988), Men's Singles is Klaus Fischer. Still not.\n- Row 14 (1985) has Poul-Erik H\u00f8yer Larsen, so nope.\n- Then I check Row 20 (1991). Robert Liljequist is there for Men's Singles.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Let me go back to earlier years. Maybe I missed some rows. \n\nLooking at the table again, Rows 4-6: 1987 has Michal Mal\u00fd in Men's Singles (Row 17), but that's for 1987? Wait no, let me clarify the row indices correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check all relevant years. Let me list out the rows where Men's Singles is Edgar Michalowski:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 4: 1985 - Poul-Erik H\u00f8yer Larsen\n- Row 6: 1987 - Michal Mal\u00fd\n- Wait, maybe I made a mistake in initial assessment. Let me go back.\n\nWait, actually, upon closer inspection, I realize that Edgar Michalowski appears in Men's Singles multiple times:\n\n- In 1984 (Row 13): Kim Brodersen\n- 1985: Poul-Erik H\u00f8yer Larsen\n- 1986: Andrey Antropov\n- 1987: Michal Mal\u00fd\n- 1988: Klaus Fischer\n- 1989: Tomasz Mendrek\n- 1990: Thomas Stuer-Lauridsen\n- 1991: Robert Liljequist\n- 1992: Tomasz Mendrek\n\nHmm, I'm not seeing Edgar Michalowski in the Men's Singles column. Did I miss something? Maybe he appears in an earlier row?\n\nWait, checking Rows 0 to 13:\n\nLooking at Row 3 (1984), Men's Singles is Kim Brodersen.\n\nRow 5: 1986, Andrey Antropov.\n\nRow 7: 1988, Klaus Fischer.\n\nI'm not finding Edgar Michalowski in the Men's Singles column. That suggests that the first part of the claim might be false.\n\nNow, checking if he played in Mixed Doubles:\n\nLooking through each row for Mixed Doubles entries where Edgar is listed.\n\n- Row 3 (1984): Erfried Michalowsky and Petra Michalowsky.\n- Row 4: Peter Buch and Hanne Adsbol.\n- Row 5: Andrey Antropov and Elena Rybkina.\n- Row 6: Thomas Mundt and Petra Michalowsky.\n- Row 7: Kai Abraham and Petra Michalowsky.\n- Row 8: Harald Koch and Helmo Goetschl? Wait, no, Mixed Doubles for 1989 is Thomas Mundt and Petra Michalowsky.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nRow 3 (1984): Mixed Doubles are Erfried Michalowsky and Petra Michalowsky. That's the first mention.\n\nThen in Row 6: 1987, Mixed Doubles are Thomas Mundt and Petra Michalowsky.\n\nRow 7: 1988, Kai Abraham and Petra Michalowsky.\n\nRow 8: 1989, Thomas Mundt and Petra Michalowsky.\n\nSo Edgar is not in any of these Mixed Doubles entries. Wait, but in Row 3, it's Erfried Michalowsky. Is that the same person? The names are similar but spelled differently. So perhaps they're different people.\n\nTherefore, based on this, I don't see Edgar Michalowski playing in either Men's Singles or Mixed Doubles in any of the provided years. This would mean the claim is false.\n\nWait, did I miss any rows where he could be in both? Maybe I need to cross-reference each year carefully.\n</think>\n\nBased on a thorough examination of the table data from 1984 to 1992, Edgar Michalowski does not appear in either the Men's Singles or Mixed Doubles categories. The entries for Mixed Doubles involve individuals with similar but different surnames (e.g., Erfried Michalowsky), which suggests they are separate individuals. Therefore, the claim that Edgar Michalowski participated in both Men's Singles and Mixed Doubles is false.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe claim is false; Edgar Michalowski did not participate in either Men's Singles or Mixed Doubles as per the provided data.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if the claim \"monika cassens have a total of 3 different partner in the women's double category\" is true or false based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that Monika Cassens has had three different partners in the women's doubles events across the years listed in the table. My task is to check each relevant cell in the table to see how many unique partners she has had.\n\nI'll start by going through each row of the table and looking at the \"women's double\" column to identify instances where Monika Cassens is mentioned as a participant. Then, I'll note her partner(s) in those instances to count how many different people she partnered with.\n\nLet me go through each year:\n\n1. **Row 3 (Year 1984):** Women's doubles are Tatyana Litvinenko and Viktoria Pron. Monika Cassens isn't here.\n2. **Row 5 (Year 1986):** Women's doubles are Lila Galjamova and Elena Rybkina. No Monika Cassens.\n3. **Row 7 (Year 1988):** Women's doubles are Monika Cassens and Petra Michalowsky.

No.\n\nWait, that's not correct. I think I made a mistake in the row indices because earlier rows might have her as well. Let me check each year properly:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- **Row 3 is 1984:** Women's doubles: Tatyana Litvinenko and Viktoria Pron.\n- **Row 5 (1986):** Lila Galjamova and Elena Rybkina.\n- **Row 7 (1988):** Monika Cassens and Petra Michalowsky. So, partner is Petra Michalowsky.\n\nMoving forward:\n\n- **Row 9 (1990):** Trine Johansson and Marlene Thomsen.\n- **Row 10 (1991):** Andrea Findhammer and Anne-Katrin Seid.\n- **Row 11 (1992):** Tanja Groves and Joanne Davies.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some rows earlier. Let me check from the beginning again:\n\nLooking at each row's women's doubles:\n\n1. Row 0: Year 1984? No, looking back, actually, the table starts with year 1973 perhaps? Wait no, the first row is Year 1973? Or maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, no, in the provided data, the rows are from 0 to 21, each representing a year. Let me make sure I correctly associate each row with its year:\n\nRow 0: Year 1973 (assuming) but looking at the data, actually the first row is Year 1973? Wait no, let's see:\n\nLooking back at the table structure, each row starts with \"Year\", so for example:\n\n- Row 0: Year 1973\n- Row 1: Year 1974\n...\nBut in the given data, rows go from 0 to 21, but the years are from 1973 to 1992.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead focus on each row's women's doubles and check when Monika Cassens is listed.\n\nLet me list all instances where \"Monika Cassens\" appears in the women's doubles:\n\n- Row 7: 1988 - Monika Cassens & Petra Michalowsky\n- Are there others?\n\nLooking through rows 0 to 21:\n\nRow 3 (Year 1984): Tatyana Litvinenko and Viktoria Pron. No.\n\nRow 5 (Year 1986): Lila Galjamova and Elena Rybkina. No.\n\nRow 7 (Year 1988): Monika Cassens & Petra Michalowsky. Partner: Petra.\n\nRow 9 (Year 1990): Trine Johansson and Marlene Thomsen. No.\n\nRow 11 (Year 1992): Tanja Groves and Joanne Davies. No.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing earlier entries. Let me check each row carefully:\n\nRow 0: Year 1973 - Women's doubles: Not listed? Or perhaps I need to see if Monika Cassens is in any other years.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she appears in multiple rows beyond row 7. Let me check each row from 0 to 21 for \"Monika Cassens\".\n\n- Row 0: Year 1973 - Women's doubles: Not mentioned.\n- Row 1: 1974 - Not mentioned.\n- ...\n- Row 5 (1986): No.\n- Row 6: Maybe not. Wait, let me list all women's doubles:\n\nLooking through each row's women's doubles:\n\nRow 0: Not listed as per the data; perhaps only certain rows have it.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the table structure, each row includes \"women's double\" participants. So I'll go through each row and check if Monika Cassens is there.\n\n- Row 0 (1973): Women's doubles: [Assuming not listed or perhaps not relevant]\n...\nActually, to save time, let me search for all occurrences of \"Monika Cassens\" in the women's doubles column across all rows.\n\nUpon checking:\n\n- Found in row 7 (Year 1988) with partner Petra Michalowsky.\n- Also found in row 15: Let me check. Wait, perhaps I should go step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps she appears only once? That would mean only one partner, which contradicts the claim of three partners. But let's make sure.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 0: Not present.\n\nRow 1: Not present.\n\n...\n\nRow 7 (Year 1988): Yes, Monika Cassens and Petra Michalowsky.\n\nIs there any other row where she appears?\n\nRow 8 (1989): Tatyana Litvinenko and Viktoria Pron. No.\n\nRow 9 (1990): Trine Johansson and Marlene Thomsen. No.\n\nRow 10 (1991): Andrea Findhammer and Anne-Katrin Seid. No.\n\nRow 11 (1992): Tanja Groves and Joanne Davies. No.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing earlier rows where she might have been a participant before 1988.\n\nLet me check row 3 (Year 1984): Tatyana Litvinenko and Viktoria Pron. No.\n\nRow 5 (1986): Lila Galjamova and Elena Rybkina. No.\n\nSo, from this, it seems Monika Cassens only appears once in the women's doubles category, partnering with Petra Michalowsky in 1988.\n\nIf that's the case, then she has only one partner, not three. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nHowever, perhaps I'm missing some rows where she might have been a participant. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking through each row from 0 to 21, focusing on the women's doubles column:\n\n- Row 3: Tatyana Litvinenko and Viktoria Pron.\n- Row 5: Lila Galjamova and Elena Rybkina.\n- Row 7: Monika Cassens & Petra Michalowsky.\n- Row 9: Trine Johansson and Marlene Thomsen.\n- Row 10: Andrea Findhammer and Anne-Katrin Seid.\n- Row 11: Tanja Groves and Joanne Davies.\n\nNo other instances of Monika Cassens found. Therefore, she only has one partner listed in the table, which contradicts the claim of three different partners.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Monika Cassens has had three different partners in women's doubles is false based on the provided data. She appears only once in the women's doubles category, partnering with Petra Michalowsky in 1988.\n\n**Answer:** False",

The claim states: \"monika cassens play women's single at the scechoslovakian internations more time than she play women's double.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's about Monika Cassens participating in two categories: Women's Singles and Women's Doubles. The claim suggests that she played in the singles category more times than in the doubles.\n\nLooking at the table, I see columns for \"women's single\" and \"women's double.\" Wait, actually, checking the column names, it might be \"women's single\" or \"women's singles,\" but perhaps a typo? Let me check each row to find entries where Monika Cassens is listed in either Women's Singles or Women's Doubles.\n\nI'll go through each year from 1986 onwards since that's when Monika Cassens starts appearing. \n\n- In 1986: The women's doubles are Lila Galjamova and Elena Rybkina, so not Monika.\n- 1987: Women's singles is Bozena Siemieniec, but women's doubles are Monika Cassens and Petra Michalowsky. So she played doubles here.\n- 1988: Women's singles is Elena Rybkina; women's doubles again have Monika and Petra. So another double for her.\n- 1989: Women's doubles are Tatyana Litvinenko and Viktoria Pron, so no Monika here.\n- 1990: Women's doubles are Trine Johansson and Marlene Thomsen, not Monika.\n- 1991: Women's doubles are Andrea Findhammer and Anne-Katrin Seid; no Monika.\n- 1992: Women's singles is Irina Serova, so she played singles here. Women's doubles are Tanja Groves and Joanne Davies; no Monika.\n\nSo let me count how many times she was in women's singles versus doubles:\n\nWomen's Singles:\n- 1987: No\n- 1988: No\n- 1989: No\n- 1990: No\n- 1991: No\n- 1992: Yes (Irina Serova is the player, so she didn't play singles herself here.

Therefore, she never played women's singles more times than doubles; in fact, she didn't play singles at all.\n\nWait, maybe I misread something. Let me check each row again for any occurrence of Monika Cassens in women's singles:\n\nLooking back, from 1986 to 1992, the women's singles players are as follows:\n- 1986: Catharina Andersson\n- 1987: Bozena Siemieniec\n- 1988: Elena Rybkina\n- 1989: Viktoria Pron\n- 1990: Camilla Martin\n- 1991: Irina Serova\n- 1992: Irina Serova\n\nMonika Cassens isn't listed in any of these women's singles entries. So she didn't play women's singles at all in the years covered by the table.\n\nTherefore, her number of appearances in women's singles is zero, while in women's doubles, she appeared twice.

So rows go from 0 (1984) to 21 (1992). Hmm, no, actually looking back, the table starts with row 0 as 1984 and ends at row 21 for 1992.\n\nWait a second, maybe I missed earlier years. Let me check rows before 13. Looking again:\n\n- Row 0 (1984): Men's Singles is Kim Brodersen.\n- Row 1 (1985): Poul-Erik H\u00f8yer Larsen.\n- Row 2 (1986): Andrey Antropov.\n- Row 3 (1987): Michal Mal\u00fd.\n- Row 4 (1988): Klaus Fischer.\n- Row 5 (1989): Tomasz Mendrek.\n- Row 6 (1990): Thomas Stuer-Lauridsen.\n- Row 7 (1991): Robert Liljequist.\n- Row 8 (1992): Tomasz Mendrek.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify the rows:\n\nLooking back, the table has 22 entries, from 1984 to 2005? Wait no, looking at the data provided, each row is a year, starting from what's shown as Row 13: 1984, then up to Row 21: 1992. So rows 0-8 correspond to years 1984-1992.\n\nWait no, perhaps the initial table starts with row 0 as 1984, but in the user's message, it shows rows from 13 onward? Or maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Edgar Michalowski appears in earlier years not shown here. Wait, looking at the data provided:\n\nThe table includes rows starting from year 1984 (Row 0) to 1992 (Row 8). But wait, checking the data again: The first row is 1984, then each subsequent row increments by one year.\n\nWait no, actually in the user's message, the table starts with \"Row 13\" as 1984. So perhaps rows are indexed from 0 to 21, but only a subset is shown here? Or maybe the data provided starts at Row 13 (1984) and goes up to Row 21 (1992). \n\nBut in any case, within the given data, I don't see Edgar Michalowski in Men's Singles or Doubles. However, I recall that earlier in the table (not shown here), Edgar might have participated.\n\nWait, looking at the initial part of the user message, before the claim, there are 21 rows listed, from year 1984 to 1992, each as separate rows. So rows 0-8 correspond to years 1984-1992.\n\nBut in those, I don't see Edgar Michalowski in any Men's Singles or Doubles entries. Therefore, based on the provided data, he did not participate in either singles or doubles during those years. \n\nHowever, wait a second: looking back at the user's message, perhaps the table includes more rows beyond what's shown? Or maybe the initial part of the table wasn't included.\n\nWait no, the user provided the entire table as per their message. So within that, Edgar isn't present in Men's Singles or Doubles.\n\nTherefore, according to this data, the claim holds true: there is no record of Edgar Michalowski participating in singles or doubles at the Czech International (assuming \"Czech\" is the event) during the years covered.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is correct based on the provided data. There is no mention of Edgar Michalowski in either Men's Singles or Doubles categories for the years listed, which range from 1984 to 1992.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, according to the given table, there is no record of Edgar Michalowski participating in singles or doubles at the Czech International during the specified years.",

The columns relevant here are \"women's doubles\" and maybe also check if she plays mixed doubles, though the claim specifies \"play double,\" which typically refers to same-gender doubles.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\nRow 2 (1984): Women's doubles - tatyana litvinenko viktoria pron.

Row 21 (1992): Tanja Groves and Joanne Davies. No Monika.\n\nWait, I think she is only in rows 5,6,7 for women's doubles. Each time, her partner is Petra Michalowsky. So every time she plays doubles, it's with the same partner.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Monika Cassens always partners with the same person in doubles at the Czechoslovakian International.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"Edgar Michalowski and Monika Cassens never partner up in mixed double\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll understand what the claim is saying. It states that these two individuals never teamed up together in the mixed doubles category across all the years listed in the table. So my task is to check each row of the table for any instance where both Edgar Michalowski and Monika Cassens are listed as partners in the \"mixed double\" column.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 21 rows, each representing a year from 1984 to 2005 (I assume based on the data). The relevant columns for this claim are \"men's singles\", \"women's singles\", and especially \"mixed doubles\". I'm focusing on the mixed doubles because that's where partnerships would be listed.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one, checking if Edgar Michalowski is in men's singles and Monika Cassens is in women's singles. If both are present, then they might have partnered in mixed doubles. Then I need to see if their names appear together in the \"mixed doubles\" column for that same year.\n\nStarting from row 0 (1984):\n- Men's singles: Kim Brodersen\n- Women's singles: Charlotte Hattens\n- Mixed doubles: Erfried Michalowski and Petra Michalowski. Neither Edgar nor Monika are here, so nothing relevant.\n\nRow 1 (1985):\n- Men's singles: Poul-Erik H\u00f8yer Larsen\n- Women's singles: Grethe Mogensen\n- Mixed doubles: Peter Buch and Hanne Adsbo\u00f6l. No match for either name.\n\nContinuing this process:\n\nRow 2 (1986):\n- Men's singles: Andrey Antropov\n- Women's singles: Catharina Andersson\n- Mixed doubles: Andrey Antropov and Elena Rybkina. Again, no match.\n\nRow 3 (1987):\n- Men's singles: Michal Mal\u00fd\n- Women's singles: Bozena Siemieniec\n- Mixed doubles: Heinz Fisher and Klaus Fisher. No relevant names here.\n\nRow 4 (1988):\n- Men's singles: Klaus Fischer\n- Women's singles: Elena Rybkina\n- Mixed doubles: Stephan Kuhl and Robert Neumann. Neither name appears.\n\nRow 5 (1989):\n- Men's singles: Tomasz Mendrek\n- Women's singles: Viktoria Pron\n- Mixed doubles: Harald Koch and Helmo Goetschl. No match.\n\nRow 6 (1990):\n- Men's singles: Thomas Stuer-Lauridsen\n- Women's singles: Camilla Martin\n- Mixed doubles: Christian Jacobsen and Marlene Thomsen. Still no relevant names.\n\nRow 7 (1991):\n- Men's singles: Robert Liljequist\n- Women's singles: Irina Serova\n- Mixed doubles: Markus Keck and Michael Helber. No match here either.\n\nRow 8 (1992):\n- Men's singles: Tomasz Mendrek\n- Women's singles: Irina Serova\n- Mixed doubles: Steffan Pandya and Anthony Busch. No names of interest.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed some rows where Edgar Michalowski is in men's singles or Monika Cassens is in women's singles. Let me go back through the table to find those instances.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 13 (1985): Men's singles: Poul-Erik H\u00f8yer Larsen; Women's singles: Grethe Mogensen. Mixed doubles: Peter Buch and Hanne Adsbo\u00f6l. No.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong rows. Let me check each row where either Edgar or Monika appears.\n\nLooking for \"Edgar Michalowski\" in men's singles:\n\n- Row 14 (1986): Men's singles: Andrey Antropov; no.\n- Row 15 (1987): Men's singles: Michal Mal\u00fd; no.\n- Row 16 (1988): Men's singles: Kim Brodersen; no.\nWait, perhaps I'm not seeing it because the names are spread out.\n\nWait, let me check all rows for \"Edgar Michalowski\" in men's singles and \"Monika Cassens\" in women's singles:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0 (1984): Men's: Kim Brodersen; Women's: Charlotte Hattens. Mixed doubles: Erfried and Petra.\n\nRow 1 (1985): Poul-Erik; Grethe. Mixed: Peter and Hanne.\n\nRow 2 (1986): Andrey; Catharina. Mixed: Andrey and Elena.\n\nRow 3 (1987): Michal Mal\u00fd; Bozena. Mixed: Heinz and Klaus.\n\nRow 4 (1988): Klaus Fischer; Elena Rybkina. Mixed: Stephan and Robert.\n\nRow 5 (1989): Tomasz Mendrek; Viktoria Pron. Mixed: Harald and Helmo.\n\nRow 6 (1990): Thomas Stuer-Lauridsen; Camilla Martin. Mixed: Christian and Marlene.\n\nRow 7 (1991): Robert Liljequist; Irina Serova. Mixed: Markus and Michael.\n\nRow 8 (1992): Tomasz Mendrek; Irina Serova. Mixed: Steffan and Anthony.\n\nWait, I don't see Edgar Michalowski in any men's singles column. Did I miss something? Let me check the table again.\n\nLooking back at the data provided by the user:\n\nThe table has rows from 1984 to 2005 (assuming based on row count). However, upon closer inspection, I realize that some rows might have different structures or names, but perhaps Edgar Michalowski isn't listed in any men's singles.\n\nWait, let me check all rows again:\n\nRow 0: Men's singles: Kim Brodersen\nRow 1: Poul-Erik H\u00f8yer Larsen\nRow 2: Andrey Antropov\nRow 3: Michal Mal\u00fd\nRow 4: Klaus Fischer\nRow 5: Tomasz Mendrek\nRow 6: Thomas Stuer-Lauridsen\nRow 7: Robert Liljequist\nRow 8: Tomasz Mendrek\n\nHmm, I don't see Edgar Michalowski in any men's singles. So if he isn't listed there, then the claim that he never partnered with Monika Cassens in mixed doubles might be trivially true because he doesn't appear in any of these rows.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing rows where he is present elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe Monika Cassens isn't in women's singles either. Let me check for her name in the women's singles column:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: Charlotte Hattens\nRow 1: Grethe Mogensen\nRow 2: Catharina Andersson\nRow 3: Bozena Siemieniec\nRow 4: Elena Rybkina\nRow 5: Viktoria Pron\nRow 6: Camilla Martin\nRow 7: Irina Serova\nRow 8: Irina Serova\n\nNo, Monika Cassens isn't listed in any women's singles either. Therefore, since neither of them appears in their respective singles categories across all rows, it's impossible for them to have partnered in mixed doubles.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake because the table might have different names or spellings. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at row 13 (assuming that's the correct numbering beyond what I initially listed), but based on the initial data provided by the user, it seems there are only 9 rows from 1984 to 2005.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\nThe user provided a table with rows starting from 1984 up to what appears to be row 20 (since counting from 0). Let me list each row's year and relevant columns.\n\nBut perhaps the key point is that neither Edgar Michalowski nor Monika Cassens appear in their respective singles categories, so they couldn't have been partners in mixed doubles. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm missing something, let me check for any possible mixed doubles entries where either of them could be involved, but given the data, it's clear that neither is present.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Edgar Michalowski and Monika Cassens never partnered in mixed doubles is supported by the provided data. Upon reviewing all rows from 1984 to 2005, neither individual appears in their respective singles categories (men's or women's), making it impossible for them to have teamed up in mixed doubles.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe claim is correct. There are no instances where Edgar Michalowski and Monika Cassens partnered in mixed doubles based on the provided data.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"edgar michalowski play all of his match in mixed double\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that Edgar Michalowski played all of his matches in the mixed doubles category. That means every time he participated in a tournament listed in the table, he was only involved in mixed doubles events and didn't participate in singles or other categories.\n\nLooking at the structure of the table, each row represents a year from 1984 to 2023 (though the provided data doesn't go that far; it stops at 1992). Each row has columns for Men's Singles, Women's Singles, Men's Doubles, Women's Doubles, and Mixed Doubles. The relevant columns here are \"Men's Singles\" and \"Mixed Doubles\" because we're checking if Edgar only played in mixed doubles.\n\nI need to find all the rows where Edgar Michalowski is listed either in the Men's Singles or the Mixed Doubles column. If he appears in any row under Men's Singles, that would mean he participated in a singles match, which would make the claim FALSE because he didn't play all his matches in mixed doubles.\n\nStarting from the top of the table:\n\n- 1984: Men's Singles is Kim Brodersen, so Edgar isn't here. Mixed Doubles has Erfried Michalowski and Petra Michalowsky. Wait, that's a different name (Erfried vs. Edgar). So no, Edgar isn't in this row.\n\nContinuing down:\n\n- 1985: Men's Singles is Poul-Erik H\u00f8yer Larsen. Not Edgar.\n- 1986: Men's Singles is Andrey Antropov. Not Edgar.\n- 1987: Men's Singles is Michal Mal\u00fd. Not Edgar.\n- 1988: Men's Singles is Klaus Fischer. Not Edgar.\n- 1989: Men's Singles is Tomasz Mendrek. Not Edgar.\n- 1990: Men's Singles is Thomas Stuer-Lauridsen. Not Edgar.\n- 1991: Men's Singles is Robert Liljequist. Not Edgar.\n- 1992: Men's Singles is Tomasz Mendrek. Not Edgar.\n\nWait a minute, I don't see Edgar Michalowski in any of the Men's Singles columns. So far, he doesn't appear there. Now, let's check if he appears in Mixed Doubles.\n\nLooking through each year:\n\n- 1984: Mixed Doubles are Erfried and Petra. Not Edgar.\n- 1985: Peter Buch and Hanne Adsbol. Not Edgar.\n- 1986: Andrey Antropov and Elena Rybkina. Not Edgar.\n- 1987: Thomas Mundt and Monika Cassens. Close, but not Edgar.\n- 1988: Kai Abraham and Petra Michalowsky. No Edgar.\n- 1989: Thomas Mundt and Petra Michalowsky again. Still no.\n- 1990: Christian Jacobsen and Marlene Thomsen. Not him.\n- 1991: Vladislav Druzchenko and Marina Yakusheva. No.\n- 1992: Hans Fischer and Irina Serova. Not Edgar.\n\nHmm, I'm not finding any instance where Edgar Michalowski is listed in the Mixed Doubles column either. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier because sometimes names can be misspelled or have variations. Let me double-check each year for both Men's Singles and Mixed Doubles.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- 1984: Erfried Michalowski in Mixed Doubles. Close to Edgar but not the same.\n- 1985: No mention of Michalowski in any column.\n- 1986: Andrey Antropov, no connection.\n- 1987: Thomas Mundt and Monika Cassens. Not related.\n- 1988: Kai Abraham and Petra. Still nothing.\n- 1989: Same as 1987 and 88.\n- 1990: Christian Jacobsen, no.\n- 1991: Vladislav and Marina.\n- 1992: Hans Fischer and Irina.\n\nWait a second, in row 16 (1987), the Men's Singles is Michal Mal\u00fd, but that doesn't relate to Edgar. The Mixed Doubles have Monika Cassens and Thomas Mundt. \n\nI'm starting to think that maybe Edgar Michalowski isn't listed in any of these rows at all. If he's not present in any row under either Men's Singles or Mixed Doubles, does that mean the claim is TRUE by default? Or perhaps the claim is about whether he played exclusively in mixed doubles when he did participate.\n\nBut since he doesn't appear anywhere, it's possible that he didn't play in these tournaments listed. However, the claim says \"all his matches,\" implying that whenever he played, it was in mixed doubles. If he never played in any of the tournaments listed here, then technically, all his matches (which are none) were in mixed doubles. But that feels a bit like a logical fallacy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed something. Let me check row 16 again: Men's Singles is Michal Mal\u00fd; Women's Singles is Monika Cassens; Men's Doubles are Thomas Mundt and someone else? Wait no, looking back:\n\nWait the columns are:\nMen's Singles\nWomen's Singles\nMen's Doubles\nWomen's Doubles\nMixed Doubles\n\nSo in 1987 (row 16), Men's Singles is Michal Mal\u00fd. Women's Singles is Monika Cassens. Men's Doubles: Thomas Mundt and someone else? Wait, no, each column has two players except for Singles.\n\nWait, looking at row 16:\n\nMen's Singles: Michal Mal\u00fd\nWomen's Singles: Monika Cassens\nMen's Doubles: Thomas Mundt & ?\nWait, actually, in the table provided, it seems like each category (except Singles) has a pair. So in Mixed Doubles for 1987: Thomas Mundt and someone else? Wait no, looking back:\n\nIn row 16 (1987), Men's Doubles are Thomas Mundt and someone else? No, actually, the columns are:\n\nMen's Singles: Michal Mal\u00fd\nWomen's Singles: Monika Cassens\nMen's Doubles: Thomas Mundt & someone?\nWait no, it seems like each row has five entries, each for a different category. So in 1987, Men's Singles is Michal Mal\u00fd; Women's Singles is Monika Cassens; Men's Doubles is Thomas Mundt and someone else? Wait, but looking back at the data provided:\n\nWait actually, the user didn't provide all years beyond 1992. Let me check again.\n\nWait no, in the initial problem statement, the table starts from 1984 to 2023, but the actual data provided stops at 1992 (row 16). So let's go back and make sure I didn't skip any rows where Edgar might appear.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check each row again for Men's Singles and Mixed Doubles:\n\n- Row 1: 1984\nMen's Singles: Kim Brodersen\nMixed Doubles: Erfried Michalowski & Petra Michalowsky\n\nNot Edgar.\n\nRow 2: 1985\nMen's Singles: Poul-Erik H\u00f8yer Larsen\nMixed Doubles: Peter Buch & Hanne Adsbol\n\nNope.\n\nRow3: 1986\nMen's Singles: Andrey Antropov\nMixed Doubles: Andrey Antropov & Elena Rybkina\n\nWait, that can't be right. Mixed Doubles would have a man and a woman. So in 1986, it's Andrey Antropov (men) and Elena Rybkina (women). That makes sense.\n\nRow4:1987\nMen's Singles: Michal Mal\u00fd\nMixed Doubles: Thomas Mundt & Monika Cassens\n\nNo Edgar.\n\nRow5:1988\nMen's Singles: Klaus Fischer\nMixed Doubles: Kai Abraham & Petra Michalowsky\n\nStill no.\n\nRow6:1989\nMen's Singles: Tomasz Mendrek\nMixed Doubles: Thomas Mundt & Petra Michalowsky\n\nNo.\n\nRow7:1990\nMen's Singles: Thomas Stuer-Lauridsen\nMixed Doubles: Christian Jacobsen & Marlene Thomsen\n\nNope.\n\nRow8:1991\nMen's Singles: Robert Liljequist\nMixed Doubles: Vladislav Druzchenko & Marina Yakusheva\n\nNo.\n\nRow9:1992\nMen's Singles: Tomasz Mendrek\nMixed Doubles: Hans Fischer & Irina Serova\n\nStill no Edgar Michalowski.\n\nWait, so in none of the rows is Edgar Michalowski listed in Men's Singles. But he isn't listed in Mixed Doubles either. So does that mean he didn't participate in any of these tournaments? If that's the case, then the claim that all his matches were in mixed doubles would be vacuously true because he didn't play in any matches listed here.\n\nHowever, maybe Edgar Michalowski did participate in some other tournaments not listed in this table. But based on the information given, we can only go by what's provided. Since he doesn't appear at all, it's unclear whether he played or not. But if we assume that these are all his matches (which is a big assumption), then yes, all of them were in mixed doubles because there are none listed.\n\nBut this seems like a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the question is implying that whenever he did play, it was in mixed doubles, but since he's not listed here, we can't confirm or deny that from this data alone.\n\nWait, no. The user says: \"You are tasked with...\" So I need to answer based on the given data. Since Edgar isn't listed anywhere, perhaps the answer is that there's no information indicating he played in any matches in singles, so all his matches (as per this table) were indeed in mixed doubles.\n\nBut actually, if he didn't play at all in these tournaments, then the claim can't be verified from this data. So maybe the answer is that we cannot confirm whether all his matches were in mixed doubles because there's no record of him playing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me re-read the problem statement:\n\n\"You are tasked with... [the rest]\"\n\nWait, the user hasn't provided a specific question yet. They just described a scenario where I have to answer a question based on some data. But in their initial message, they said: \"You are tasked with...\" but didn't provide the actual question.\n\nWait no, looking back:\n\nThe user wrote: \"You are tasked with... [rest of problem statement]\". Then below, under the hood, they provided an example query and response.\n\nBut in this case, I think the user is asking me to answer a specific question based on the data from 1984 to 2023, which was partially provided. The task seems to be about determining whether all of Edgar Michalowski's matches were in mixed doubles based on the given table.\n\nGiven that, and seeing that Edgar isn't listed anywhere except perhaps in row 1 as Erfried Michalowski? Wait, in row 1 (1984), Mixed Doubles: Erfried Michalowski & Petra Michalowsky. So is that the same person?\n\nWait, the names are slightly different: \"Erfried\" vs. \"Edgar\". Could be a typo or different spelling.\n\nIf so, then in 1984, Edgar (if that's the same person) played mixed doubles with Petra Michalowsky. In other rows, there's no mention of him. So if we consider that, perhaps he only played once in mixed doubles, and thus all his matches were indeed in mixed doubles.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to be certain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to know whether Edgar Michalowski participated exclusively in mixed doubles based on the given data. Since he's not listed elsewhere except possibly in 1984 as Erfried, which might be a misspelling, we can infer that if that's him, then yes, all his matches (just one) were in mixed doubles.\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to know how many times he played in singles versus doubles. Since he isn't listed in Men's Singles or Women's Singles, and only appears once in Mixed Doubles (if that's him), then yes, all his matches were in mixed doubles.\n\nSo putting it all together, based on the given data, Edgar Michalowski participated in Mixed Doubles in 1984 with Petra Michalowsky. There is no record of him playing in any Singles or other Doubles categories. Therefore, according to this table, all his matches were indeed in mixed doubles.\n</think>\n\nBased on the provided data from 1984 to 2023, Edgar Michalowski (possibly spelled as Erfried Michalowski) participated in Mixed Doubles in 1984 alongside Petra Michalowsky. There is no record of him participating in Singles or other Doubles categories within this dataset. Therefore, according to the information given, all his matches listed were in mixed doubles.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, based on the provided data, all of Edgar Michalowski's recorded matches were in mixed doubles.",
