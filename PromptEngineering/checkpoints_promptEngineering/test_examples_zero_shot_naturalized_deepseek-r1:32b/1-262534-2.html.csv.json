    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"institution locate in ohio have the highest average enrollment\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll identify which institutions are located in Ohio. Looking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Bluefield College is in Virginia.\nRow 2: Campbellsville University is in Kentucky.\nRow 3: Cumberland University is in Tennessee.\nRow 4: University of the Cumberlands is in Kentucky.\nRow 5: Georgetown College is in Kentucky.\nRow 6: Lindsey Wilson College is in Kentucky.\nRow 7: University of Pikeville is in Kentucky.\nRow 8: University of Rio Grande is in Ohio. So that's one institution in Ohio.\nRow 9: Shawnee State University is also in Ohio. That's the second one.\nRow 10: St. Catharine College is in Kentucky.\n\nSo, there are two institutions in Ohio: Row 8 and Row 9.\n\nNext, I need to find their enrollments. \n\nFor Row 8 (University of Rio Grande), enrollment is 1893.\nFor Row 9 (Shawnee State University), enrollment is 4300.\n\nTo find the average enrollment for Ohio institutions: (1893 + 4300) / 2 = (6193)/2 = 3096.5.\n\nNow, I need to check if this average is higher than the average enrollments of institutions in other states.\n\nLooking at the other states:\n\nKentucky has several institutions: Campbellsville U (enrollment 3318), Georgetown C (1400), Lindsey Wilson C (2677), University of Pikeville (1156), and St. Catharine C (700). \n\nWait, but I should check all states to see if any other state has a higher average than Ohio's 3096.5.\n\nLet me list out all the enrollments by state:\n\nVirginia: Bluefield College - 793.\nKentucky: multiple institutions as above.\nTennessee: Cumberland University - 1345.\nOhio: two institutions, average 3096.5.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the average for each state and compare them all.\n\nSo let's compute averages per state:\n\n- Virginia (Row1): Only Bluefield College with 793 \u2192 Average = 793.\n- Kentucky:\n  Institutions: Row2 (3318), Row4 (1743), Row5 (1400), Row6 (2677), Row7 (1156), Row10 (700).\n  Total enrollment: 3318 + 1743 = 5061; plus 1400 is 6461, plus 2677 is 9138, plus 1156 is 10294, plus 700 is 10994.\n  Number of institutions: 6. Average = 10994 / 6 \u2248 1832.33.\n\n- Tennessee (Row3): Cumberland University - 1345 \u2192 Average =1345.\n\n- Ohio: Average is 3096.5 as calculated earlier.\n\nNow, comparing the averages:\n\nOhio: ~3096.5\nKentucky: ~1832.33\nVirginia: 793\nTennessee: 1345\n\nSo, the highest average is Ohio's 3096.5, which is higher than all other states.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"institution locate in ohio have the highest average enrollment\" is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the only public institution be also the most recently founded 1.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like there are two conditions here:\n1. Identify the only public institution in the table.\n2. Check if that same institution is the most recently founded one.\n\nSo, starting with identifying the public institutions. Looking through each row, I see that most entries under \"type\" are either private or have specific affiliations like SBC, Methodist, etc. However, Row 9 mentions Shawnee State University as a public institution. That's the only one listed as public in the table.\n\nNow, for the second part: is this public institution also the most recently founded? TheFounded year for Shawnee State University is 1986. Let me check all other institutions' founding years to see if any were established after 1986.\n\nGoing through each row:\n- Bluefield College: Founded in 1922\n- Campbellsville University: 1906\n- Cumberland University: 1842\n- University of the Cumberlands: 1887\n- Georgetown College: 1829\n- Lindsey Wilson College: 1903\n- University of Pikeville: 1889\n- University of Rio Grande: 1876\n- Shawnee State University: 1986\n- St. Catharine College: 1873\n\nLooking at these, 1986 is indeed the most recent founding year among all the institutions listed. So, Shawnee State University being public and founded in 1986 satisfies both conditions of the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking that Shawnee State University is the only public institution and was founded in 1986, which is the most recent founding year among all listed institutions.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"most of the mid-south conference institution be locate in kentucky\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that most institutions in the Mid-South Conference are located in Kentucky. So, my task is to check how many of these institutions are in Kentucky and see if it's more than half.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are 10 rows, each representing an institution with various details. I need to look specifically at the \"location\" column for each row to determine where they're located.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Bluefield College is in Bluefield, Virginia.\nRow 2: Campbellsville University is in Campbellsville, Kentucky.\nRow 3: Cumberland University is in Lebanon, Tennessee.\nRow 4: University of the Cumberlands is in Williamsburg, Kentucky.\nRow 5: Georgetown College is in Georgetown, Kentucky.\nRow 6: Lindsey Wilson College is in Columbia, Kentucky.\nRow 7: University of Pikeville is in Pikeville, Kentucky.\nRow 8: University of Rio Grande is in Rio Grande, Ohio.\nRow 9: Shawnee State University is in Portsmouth, Ohio.\nRow 10: St. Catharine College is in St. Catharine, Kentucky.\n\nNow, counting the institutions in Kentucky:\n\n- Row 2: Campbellsville\n- Row 4: Williamsburg\n- Row 5: Georgetown\n- Row 6: Columbia\n- Row 7: Pikeville\n- Row 10: St. Catharine\n\nThat's a total of 6 institutions located in Kentucky.\n\nThe other locations are:\n- Virginia (Row 1)\n- Tennessee (Row 3)\n- Ohio (Rows 8 and 9)\n\nSo, out of 10 institutions, 6 are in Kentucky. To determine if \"most\" are there, I need to see if more than half are located there. Since half of 10 is 5, having 6 means it's indeed a majority.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be TRUE because more than half (6 out of 10) of the institutions are in Kentucky.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells, I need to list each row and the \"location\" column for all rows.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the number of student who be bear be greater than the number of patriot and blue raider combine\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim refers to. The claim mentions three groups: bears, patriots, and blue raiders. For each of these nicknames, I need to find the corresponding institution(s) in the table and sum their enrollments. Then, compare if the total number of bear students is greater than the combined number of patriot and blue raider students.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. **Bears**: Let's scan through the \"nickname (colors)\" column for mentions of bears.\n   - Row 7: University of Pikeville has nickname \"bears\" with enrollment 1,156.\n   - Row 9: Shawnee State University also has \"bears\" but its football is listed as no. Wait, does that affect anything? The claim doesn't mention football, just the number of students who are bears. So I think we include both.\n   - However, on closer look, the enrollment for Shawnee State is 4,300, and they have \"bears\" as their nickname. But wait, let me check each row carefully.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's go through each row:\n\nRow 1: bluefield college - rams\nRow 2: campbellsville university - tigers\nRow 3: cumberland university - bulldogs\nRow 4: university of the cumberlands - patriots\nRow 5: georgetown college - tigers\nRow 6: lindsey wilson college - blue raiders\nRow 7: university of pikeville - bears\nRow 8: university of rio grande - redstorm (football no)\nRow 9: shawnee state university - bears (public, football no)\nRow 10: st catharine college - patriots\n\nSo, the two institutions with nickname \"bears\" are Row 7 and Row 9. Their enrollments are 1,156 and 4,300 respectively.\n\nNext, **Patriots**: Checking the table:\n\n- Row 4: university of the cumberlands - patriots (enrollment 1,743)\n- Row 10: st catharine college - patriots (enrollment 700)\n\nSo total patriots are 1,743 + 700 = 2,443.\n\n**Blue Raiders**: Only Row 6 mentions blue raiders with enrollment 2,677.\n\nNow, the claim says the number of bears is greater than the sum of patriots and blue raiders. Let's calculate:\n\nTotal Bears: 1,156 (Row7) + 4,300 (Row9) = 5,456\nTotal Patriots + Blue Raiders: 2,443 (patriots) + 2,677 (blue raiders) = 5,120\n\nSo 5,456 > 5,120? Yes, that's correct. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, compiling the relevant cells:\n\n- For Bears: Row7 and Row9 under \"enrollment\"\n- For Patriots: Row4 and Row10 under \"enrollment\"\n- For Blue Raiders: Row6 under \"enrollment\"\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\nRow7: enrollment\nRow9: enrollment\nRow4: enrollment\nRow10: enrollment\nRow6: enrollment\n\nTherefore, the JSON should reflect these rows with their respective column names.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"the majority of institutions in the mid-south conference were founded in the 1800s\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The key points are:\n\n1. Institutions in the mid-south conference: From the table, all the institutions listed are likely part of the mid-south conference since that's the context given.\n2. Founded in the 1800s: So we're looking for institutions established between 1801 and 1900.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Bluefield College was founded in 1922, which is after the 1800s. So not relevant.\nRow 2: Campbellsville University was founded in 1906, which is just barely into the 20th century. Still not in the 1800s.\nRow 3: Cumberland University was founded in 1842. That's within the 1800s.\nRow 4: University of the Cumberlands was founded in 1887, which is still in the 19th century (since it's before 1900). So yes.\nRow 5: Georgetown College was founded in 1829. Definitely in the 1800s.\nRow 6: Lindsey Wilson College was founded in 1903, just after the turn of the century, so not in the 1800s.\nRow 7: University of Pikeville was founded in 1889. That's within the 1800s.\nRow 8: University of Rio Grande was founded in 1876. Yes, that's in the 1800s.\nRow 9: Shawnee State University was founded in 1986. Way after the 1800s.\nRow 10: St. Catharine College was founded in 1873. That's within the 1800s.\n\nNow, counting how many were founded in the 1800s:\n\nRows 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8. That's five institutions. The rest were founded either before or after. Wait, but wait: Row 4 is University of the Cumberlands (founded 1887), which is in the 1800s? Actually, 1887 is in the 19th century, so yes.\n\nTotal rows with institutions founded in the 1800s: Rows 3,4,5,7,8. That's five out of ten. So majority would be more than half, which is six or more. Since it's exactly five, that's not a majority. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each row:\n\n1. Bluefield College: 1922 - No\n2. Campbellsville U: 1906 - No (just after)\n3. Cumberland U: 1842 - Yes\n4. U of Cumberlands: 1887 - Yes\n5. Georgetown College: 1829 - Yes\n6. Lindsey Wilson: 1903 - No\n7. U of Pikeville: 1889 - Yes\n8. U of Rio Grande: 1876 - Yes\n9. Shawnee State: 1986 - No\n10. St. Catharine: 1873 - Yes\n\nSo that's rows 3,4,5,7,8, and 10? Wait, did I miss row 10 earlier?\n\nRow 10 is St. Catharine College founded in 1873. That adds another one, making it six institutions. So now the count is six out of ten.\n\nWait, that's a majority because six is more than half of ten (which is five). So that changes things. So six institutions were founded in the 1800s: rows 3,4,5,7,8, and 10. Therefore, the claim would be true.\n\nBut wait, let me check row 10 again. Yes, it's 1873, so that's within the 1800s. So total of six institutions were founded in the 1800s out of ten.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"2 times as many of the mid-south conference be located in Ohio than be in Kentucky.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It suggests that twice as many institutions from the Mid-South Conference are in Ohio compared to Kentucky.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an institution with details like location and whether they have football (which might relate to conference membership). The column \"football\" seems relevant because if a school has football, it's more likely to be part of a conference like Mid-South. \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Bluefield College: Located in Virginia. Football is yes.\n2. Campbellsville University: Kentucky. Yes.\n3. Cumberland University: Tennessee. Yes.\n4. University of the Cumberlands: Kentucky. Yes.\n5. Georgetown College: Kentucky. Yes.\n6. Lindsey Wilson College: Kentucky. Yes.\n7. University of Pikeville: Kentucky. Yes.\n8. University of Rio Grande: Ohio. Football is no, so maybe not in the conference?\n9. Shawnee State University: Ohio. Football no.\n10. St. Catharine College: Kentucky. Football no.\n\nSo for institutions with football (which I assume are in the conference):\n\n- Kentucky: Rows 2,4,5,6,7 \u2192 5 schools.\n- Ohio: Only Row 8 has football as 'no', so it's not included. So Ohio doesn't have any schools with football that could be part of the Mid-South Conference based on this table.\n\nWait, the claim says twice as many in Ohio than Kentucky. But according to this, Kentucky has 5 and Ohio has 0. That would mean Ohio is less, so the claim isn't true. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the 'mid-south conference' part\u2014does it only include certain types of institutions?\n\nLooking again at each row's location:\n\n- Institutions in Kentucky with football: All except rows 8,9,10 have football yes. So that's 6 schools (rows 2,4,5,6,7). Wait no, let me recount.\n\nRows with football yes and their locations:\nRow 1: Virginia\nRow2: KY - Yes\nRow3: TN - Yes\nRow4: KY - Yes\nRow5: KY - Yes\nRow6: KY - Yes\nRow7: KY - Yes\nRow8: OH - No\nRow9: OH - No\nRow10: KY - No\n\nSo the football yes schools in Kentucky are rows 2,4,5,6,7. That's five institutions.\n\nOhio only has row8 and 9, but both have football no. So zero.\n\nThus, the number of Mid-South Conference institutions in Ohio is 0, and in Kentucky it's 5. The claim says Ohio has twice as many as Kentucky, which would mean 10 in OH vs 5 in KY. But clearly not, so the claim is FALSE.\n\nSo I need to extract all rows where location is in Kentucky or Ohio and football is yes. \n\nRelevant cells are:\n\nFor each row that mentions location (Ohio or Kentucky) and has football as 'yes'.\n\nLooking at rows:\n\n- Row2: Kentucky, football yes\n- Row4: Kentucky, yes\n- Row5: Kentucky, yes\n- Row6: Kentucky, yes\n- Row7: Kentucky, yes\n\nSo these are the relevant cells.\n\nTherefore, answer is FALSE because Ohio has zero while Kentucky has five.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location (population)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"football\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location (population)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"football\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location (population)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"football\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location (population)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"football\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location (population)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"football\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"institution located in kentucky have 2 times the enrollment of ohio institution\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts: identifying institutions located in Kentucky and Ohio, and then comparing their enrollments to see if Kentucky's total enrollment is double that of Ohio's.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to list out all the institutions in each state. \n\nFor Kentucky:\n- Row 2: Campbellsville University\n- Row 4: University of the Cumberlands\n- Row 5: Georgetown College\n- Row 6: Lindsey Wilson College\n- Row 7: University of Pikeville\n\nFor Ohio:\n- Row 8: University of Rio Grande\n- Row 9: Shawnee State University\n\nNext, I'll extract their enrollments. \n\nKentucky institutions' enrollments are as follows:\n- Campbellsville University: 3,318\n- University of the Cumberlands: 1,743\n- Georgetown College: 1,400\n- Lindsey Wilson College: 2,677\n- University of Pikeville: 1,156\n\nAdding these up: 3,318 + 1,743 = 5,061; then +1,400 = 6,461; +2,677 = 9,138; +1,156 gives a total of 10,294.\n\nOhio institutions' enrollments:\n- University of Rio Grande: 1,893\n- Shawnee State University: 4,300\n\nAdding these: 1,893 + 4,300 = 6,193.\n\nNow, the claim states that Kentucky's enrollment is twice Ohio's. So, I need to check if 10,294 equals 2 times 6,193.\n\nCalculating twice Ohio's total: 6,193 * 2 = 12,386.\n\nComparing this with Kentucky's total of 10,294, it's clear that 10,294 is less than 12,386. Therefore, the claim isn't accurate; Kentucky institutions don't have twice the enrollment of Ohio's.\n\nSo, based on these calculations, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim \"the most recently found institution be a private 1\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The phrase \"most recently found\" probably refers to the institution that was founded most recently, i.e., has the latest founding year. Then, it's asking if that particular institution is a private one.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 10 institutions listed. Each row contains information about an institution, including its founding year and type (which mentions whether it's private or public).\n\nI'll start by identifying which institution was founded most recently. To do this, I need to look through each row's \"founded\" column.\n\nRow 1: Founded in 1922\nRow 2: 1906\nRow 3: 1842\nRow 4: 1887\nRow 5: 1829\nRow 6: 1903\nRow 7: 1889\nRow 8: 1876\nRow 9: 1986\nRow 10: 1873\n\nWait, row 9 is Shawnee State University, founded in 1986. That seems to be the most recent founding year compared to others like 1922 (row1), 1906 (row2), etc.\n\nNow, checking row 9's type: it's public. The claim says the most recently founded should be private. But Shawnee State University is public, so that would make the claim false.\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check in case I missed any other institution with a later founding year than 1986. Looking back:\n\nRow 1: 1922\nRow 2: 1906\nRow 3: 1842\nRow 4: 1887\nRow 5: 1829\nRow 6: 1903\nRow 7: 1889\nRow 8: 1876\nRow 9: 1986\nRow 10: 1873\n\nNo, row 9 is indeed the most recent with 1986. So it's public, meaning the claim that the most recently found institution is private is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the most recently founded institution is private. The table shows Shawnee State University was founded in 1986, which is the latest, and it's public. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says: \"the number of students who be patriot be 3 times as large as the number of student who be bear.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this means. It seems like it's saying that the total number of students at institutions with the nickname 'Patriots' is three times larger than the total number of students at institutions with the nickname 'Bears'. So I need to find all rows where the nickname is Patriots and sum their enrollments, then do the same for Bears. Then check if the Patriot total is three times the Bear total.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFor Patriotic Nicknames:\n- Row 4: University of the Cumberlands has nickname \"patriots\" with enrollment 1743.\n- Row 10: St. Catharine College also has \"patriots\" with enrollment 700.\nSo total for Patriots is 1743 + 700 = 2443.\n\nFor Bear Nicknames:\n- Row 7: University of Pikeville has nickname \"bears\" with enrollment 1156.\n- Row 9: Shawnee State University also has \"bears\" with enrollment 4300.\nSo total for Bears is 1156 + 4300 = 5456.\n\nNow, checking if 2443 is three times 5456. Let's calculate 3*5456 which is 16368. But 2443 is way less than that. So the claim is false because Patriots have fewer students compared to Bears, not three times more.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the number of students at institutions with the nickname 'Patriots' is three times larger than those with 'Bears'. Calculating enrollments shows this isn't true.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"only 1 institution in the mid-south be found in the 1800s\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It states that only one institution from the Mid-South region was founded in the 1800s. The table has information about various institutions with details like location and founding year. \n\nI should focus on two main aspects: \n1. Institutions located in the Mid-South.\n2. Those founded between 1801 and 1900 (since mid-19th century would be 1850s, but I think here it's referring to any part of the 1800s).\n\nLooking at the table, each row has an institution with its location. I need to check which are in the Mid-South states. From my knowledge, Mid-South typically includes states like Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, and others in that region.\n\nChecking each institution:\n- Row 1: Bluefield College, Virginia. Virginia is not in the Mid-South as it's more on the East Coast.\n- Row 2: Campbellsville University, Kentucky. Kentucky is part of the Mid-South.\n- Row 3: Cumberland University, Tennessee. Tennessee is Mid-South.\n- Row 4: University of the Cumberlands, Kentucky. Also Mid-South.\n- Row 5: Georgetown College, Kentucky. Mid-South.\n- Row 6: Lindsey Wilson College, Kentucky. Mid-South.\n- Row 7: University of Pikeville, Kentucky. Mid-South.\n- Row 8: University of Rio Grande, Ohio. Ohio is in the Mid-West or Mid-Atlantic but can be considered part of Mid-South depending on context.\n- Row 9: Shawnee State University, Ohio. Same as above.\n- Row 10: St. Catharine College, Kentucky. Mid-South.\n\nNow, I need to check which of these were founded in the 1800s. \n\nLooking at the 'founded' column:\n- Row 2: Founded 1906 \u2192 Not 1800s.\n- Row 3: Founded 1842 \u2192 Yes, 1800s.\n- Row 4: Founded 1887 \u2192 Yes.\n- Row 5: Founded 1829 \u2192 Yes.\n- Row 6: Founded 1903 \u2192 No.\n- Row 7: Founded 1889 \u2192 Yes.\n- Row 8: Founded 1876 \u2192 But location is Ohio, which I'm considering as Mid-South for this context. So yes, but it's football status is 'no', but that doesn't matter here.\n- Row 9: Founded 1986 \u2192 No.\n- Row 10: Founded 1873 \u2192 Yes.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"only 1 institution\". However, looking at the data:\n\nRow 3: Cumberland University, founded 1842 (Mid-South)\nRow 4: University of the Cumberlands, 1887\nRow 5: Georgetown College, 1829\nRow 7: University of Pikeville, 1889\nRow 10: St. Catharine College, 1873\n\nThat's five institutions founded in the 1800s within Mid-South states (Kentucky and Tennessee). Additionally, Row 8 is in Ohio with a founding year of 1876.\n\nWait, but perhaps I misread. The claim says \"only 1 institution in the mid-south be found in the 1800s.\" So only one should have been founded in that time period. But from the table, multiple institutions were founded in the 1800s.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would include all rows where the location is in Mid-South and founded year is in the 1800s.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there are multiple institutions founded in the 1800s in the Mid-South region.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that only one institution in the Mid-South was founded in the 1800s. However, examining the table reveals multiple institutions in Mid-South states (Kentucky and Tennessee) with founding years in the 19th century.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE  \n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Rows 3, 4, 5, 7, 10 for 'founded' column as they show multiple institutions founded in the 1800s within Mid-South locations. Additionally, Row 8 is included since it's in Ohio (Mid-South) and founded in the 19th century.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
