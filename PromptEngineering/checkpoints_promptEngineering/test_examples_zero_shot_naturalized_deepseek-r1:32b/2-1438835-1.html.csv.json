    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"sc freiburg play in the uefa europe league competition 3 times in 2013-14 all in the group h round against club sevilla, estoril, and slovan liberec.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim.\n\n1. **Competition and Season**: The competition is the UEFA Europe League (which I know is also called the UEFA Europa League) during the 2013-14 season.\n   \n   Looking at the table, rows 5, 6, and 7 are from the 2013-14 season and under the competition \"uefa europa league\". So that's a match.\n\n2. **Number of Times**: The claim states they played 3 times in the group h round. Let's check how many matches are listed for each club in group h.\n\n   - Sevilla: Row 5 shows one home game against someone else, but their away game is against Estoril (0-2). So that's two games?\n   \n   Wait, no, actually, looking at the table:\n   - Row 5: Sevilla vs. someone (home: -, away: 0-2) \u2013 maybe this is a group match.\n   - Row 6: Estoril vs. someone else, both home and away are empty, so perhaps they played multiple games but only some are listed here.\n   - Row 7: Slovan Liberec played against someone (home: 2-2), and their away game is empty.\n\n   Hmm, actually, the table shows that in group h for 2013-14, there are three clubs mentioned: Sevilla, Estoril, and Slovan Liberec. Each has a row with their results.\n\n3. **Opponents**: The claim says they played against Sevilla, Estoril, and Slovan Liberec. Checking the table, these three clubs are indeed in group h for that season.\n\n4. **Team Mentioned**: The claim is about \"sc freiburg\". Wait a minute, looking at the table, I don't see any entry where the club is SC Freiburg. All the rows mention Slavia Prague, Matador P\u00fachov, St Gallen, Feyenoord, Sevilla, Estoril, and Slovan Liberec.\n\n   So SC Freiburg isn't listed in the table at all. Therefore, there's no evidence that they played in the 2013-14 UEFA Europa League group h against those clubs as claimed.\n\nSo putting it together: The claim mentions SC Freiburg participating three times in group h against specific opponents. But since SC Freiburg isn't present in any of the rows, especially not in the 2013-14 season's group h entries, the claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says two things:\n1. When the home score was 0-1 in the 2001-02 UEFA Cup, the club was St Gallen.\n2. When the away score was 0-1 in the same competition and season, the club was Feyenoord.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim separately to see if they hold true against the table data.\n\nStarting with the first part: home score 0-1 in the 2001-02 UEFA Cup. Looking through the rows, row 3 has the season 2001-02 and competition is UEFA Cup. The club there is St Gallen, and indeed the home score is 0-1. So this part checks out.\n\nNow for the second part: away score 0-1 in the same season and competition. Checking row 4, it's also 2001-02 and UEFA Cup. The club here is Feyenoord, and the away score is listed as 0-1. That matches the claim perfectly.\n\nI don't see any other rows that would contradict these points. Both conditions are satisfied by rows 3 and 4 respectively. Therefore, the claim seems to be accurate based on the table provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly identifies St Gallen with a home score of 0-1 in row 3 and Feyenoord with an away score of 0-1 in row 4.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"club\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"club\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim has a few parts, so I'll break it down and check each against the data.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"the highest away score be 4 - 1 in the 2001 - 02 season\". So, I'm looking for the away scores in that season and see if any match 4-1. Looking at the table:\n\nRow 3 is from the 2001-02 season, competition: uefa cup, round: second round. The club is st gallen with home score 0-1 and away score 4-1. That's a 4-1 away score. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, it mentions \"the lowest away score be 0 - 0 on 2 occasions in the 1995 - 96 season and the 2001 - 02 season\". I need to find if there are two instances of a 0-0 away score in those seasons.\n\nLooking at the 1995-96 season (Row 1): club is slavia prague, away score is 0-0. That's one instance.\n\nNow for the 2001-02 season, checking all rows with that season:\n\nRow 2: matador p\u00fachov, away score 0-0.\nRow 3: st gallen, away score 4-1 (not 0-0).\nRow 4: feyenoord, away score 0-1 (also not 0-0).\n\nWait, only Row 2 has a 0-0 away score in the 2001-02 season. So that's one instance, but the claim says two occasions across both seasons. Let me count again.\n\nIn total:\n\n- 1995-96: 1 instance (Row 1)\n- 2001-02: 1 instance (Row 2)\n\nSo together, there are two instances of 0-0 away scores across the two seasons mentioned. That part is correct too.\n\nWait a second, but in Row 4 of 2001-02 season, the away score is 0-1, which isn't 0-0. So only one instance in that season. Combined with the other season, it's two instances across both seasons, as the claim says.\n\nBut wait, does the claim mean two instances in each season or a total of two across both? The wording is \"on 2 occasion in the 1995 - 96 season and the 2001 - 02 season\". So it's saying that there are two occasions where the away score was 0-0, one in each season. That seems to be correct.\n\nWait, actually, looking back: the claim says \"the lowest away score be 0 - 0 on 2 occasion in the 1995 - 96 season and the 2001 - 02 season\". So it's saying that across both seasons, there are two occasions where the away score was 0-0. Since Row 1 (1995) has one, and Row 2 (2001) has another, that makes two in total. So yes, that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the data. The highest away score is indeed 4-1 in the 2001-02 season, and there are two instances where the away score was 0-0 across both seasons.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away\"}\n   ]\n}",

Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 5: Club is Sevilla, not Estoril.\n- Row 6: Club is Estoril. The season listed is 2013 - 14, which matches the claim.\n  \nOkay, so that part checks out.\n\nNext, checking for Slavia Prague. Going through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Club is Slavia Prague.

The goal is to determine whether the claim about SC Freiburg playing in the first round of the UEFA Cup competition during the 1995-96 and 2001-02 seasons is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"SC Freiburg play in the first round on 2 occasions in the UEFA Cup competition in season 1995 - 96 and 2001 - 02.\" So, the key points to verify are:\n\n1. Are there two instances where SC Freiburg played in the first round?\n2. Did these occur in both the 1995-96 and 2001-02 seasons?\n3. Was it specifically in the UEFA Cup competition?\n\nNext, I'll examine each row of the table to see if SC Freiburg is mentioned or implied.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Season 1995-96, Competition: UEFA Cup, Round: First round, Club: Slavia Prague. There's no mention of SC Freiburg here; instead, it's about Slavia Prague facing another team.\n\nRow 2: Season 2001-02, Competition: UEFA Cup, Round: First round, Club: Matador P\u00fachov. Again, the club listed is Matador P\u00fachov, not SC Freiburg.\n\nRow 3: Season 2001-02, Competition: UEFA Cup, Round: Second round, Club: St Gallen. Still no mention of SC Freiburg.\n\nRow 4: Season 2001-02, Competition: UEFA Cup, Round: Third round, Club: Feyenoord. No Freiburg here either.\n\nRows 5, 6, and 7 are about the 2013-14 season in the UEFA Europa League, which is a different competition than the UEFA Cup mentioned in the claim. Moreover, these rows don't mention SC Freiburg either.\n\nAfter reviewing all the rows, I notice that SC Freiburg isn't listed at all in any of the competitions or rounds provided. The clubs involved are Slavia Prague, Matador P\u00fachov, St Gallen, Feyenoord, Sevilla, Estoril, and Slovan Liberec. There's no entry for SC Freiburg in either of the seasons mentioned (1995-96 and 2001-02) under the UEFA Cup.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given in the table, there is no evidence supporting that SC Freiburg participated in the first round of the UEFA Cup during those two seasons.

When the away score was 1-1 also in the 2001-02 UEFA Cup, the club was Feyenoord.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part separately.\n\nFor the first part: The claim says that when the home score is 0-1 in the 2001-02 season, the club is St Gallen. Let me check the table rows for that season and competition.\n\nLooking at Row 3: Season 2001-02, Competition UEFA Cup, Round second round, Club St Gallen, Home score 0-1, Away score 4-1. So yes, when the home score was 0-1 for St Gallen in that season and competition, it's correct.\n\nNow, the second part: When the away score is 1-1 in the same season and competition, the club should be Feyenoord. Let me check Row 4: Season 2001-02, Competition UEFA Cup, Round third round, Club Feyenoord, Home score 2-2, Away score 0-1. Wait, that's an away score of 0-1, not 1-1.\n\nHmm, is there any other row where the away score is 1-1? Let me check all rows again:\n\nRow 1: UEFA Cup 95-96, home 1-2, away 0-0.\nRow 2: UEFA Cup 01-02, home 2-1, away 0-0.\nRow 3: Home 0-1, away 4-1.\nRow 4: Away score is 0-1. No other rows with away score 1-1.\n\nSo the claim says when away score is 1-1 in that season and competition, it's Feyenoord. But looking at Row 4, the away score is 0-1, not 1-1. So there's no entry where away score is 1-1 for Feyenoord or any other club in that season.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim need to be true for it to be TRUE.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"the highest away score be 3 - 1 in the 2001 - 02 season and the lowest away score be 0 - 0 on 2 occasions in the 1995 - 96 season and the 2001 - 02 season.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim.\n\n1. **Highest away score of 3-1 in the 2001-02 season:**\n   Let's check all rows for the 2001-02 season and see what the away scores are.\n   \n   - Row 2 (2001-02): Away score is 0-0.\n   - Row 3 (2001-02): Away score is 4-1. Wait, no, actually, looking back, row 3's away score is listed as 4-1 for St Gallen? Wait, I think I might have misread. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the table provided:\n- Row 3: season 2001-02, club st gallen, home 0-1, away 4-1. So the away score is 4-1, which is a higher score than 3-1. Hmm, that suggests the claim's highest away score might be incorrect because 4-1 is higher than 3-1.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the claim. The claim says \"highest away score be 3 - 1\". But in row 3, the away score for St Gallen is 4-1. That would mean the highest away score in 2001-02 is actually 4-1, not 3-1. So this part of the claim seems to be incorrect.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the table correctly. Each row represents a match for a specific club in that season and round. The 'away' column shows the score from that club's perspective when playing away. For example, Row 3: St Gallen played at home (0-1) and away (4-1). So their away score was 4-1. That means the highest away score in 2001-02 is indeed 4-1.\n\nSo if the claim says the highest away score is 3-1, that's incorrect because there's a higher score of 4-1. Therefore, this part of the claim is false.\n\nWait, but let me check all rows for 2001-02 again:\n\nRow 2: Matador P\u00fachov, away score 0-0.\nRow 3: St Gallen, away score 4-1.\nRow 4: Feyenoord, away score 0-1.\n\nSo the highest is indeed 4-1. So the claim's first part is wrong.\n\n2. **Lowest away score of 0-0 on two occasions in 1995-96 and 2001-02 seasons:**\n   Let's check each season for away scores of 0-0.\n   \n   For 1995-96 (Row 1): Away score is 0-0. So that's one occurrence.\n\n   For 2001-02:\n   - Row 2: 0-0\n   - Are there others? Let's see other rows in 2001-02:\n     - Row 3: away 4-1\n     - Row 4: away 0-1\n   So only one occurrence of 0-0 in 2001-02 (Row 2).\n\nSo the claim says \"on 2 occasions\" across both seasons. But in 1995-96, it's once, and in 2001-02, also once. So that makes two total instances of 0-0 away scores, correct? Therefore, this part is true.\n\nBut since the first part (highest away score) is incorrect, the overall claim is false.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm if any other rows in 2001-02 have an away score of 0-0. Looking again:\n\nRow 2: Matador P\u00fachov, away 0-0.\nNo others in 2001-02 have 0-0 except that.\n\nSo yes, two occasions across the two seasons (one each), so that part is correct.\n\nBut because the first part about the highest away score being 3-1 is wrong, the entire claim is false.\n\nNow, to identify relevant cells:\n\nFor the highest away score in 2001-02:\n- Row 3: away score 4-1. So column 'away'.\n\nFor the lowest away scores of 0-0:\n- Row 1: season 1995-96, away 0-0.\n- Row 2: season 2001-02, away 0-0.\n\nSo the relevant cells are row 1 (away), row 2 (away), and row 3 (away) because we checked all of them to see if there's a higher score than 3-1. But perhaps only rows where 0-0 occurs and where the highest is found.\n\nWait, in the claim, it mentions \"highest away score be 3 - 1\". Since that's incorrect, but in row 3, we have a higher score of 4-1, so that cell (row 3, away) is relevant because it shows the actual highest. Similarly, rows where 0-0 occurs are rows 1 and 2.\n\nSo compiling all these:\n\n- Row 1: column 'away' for 0-0.\n- Row 2: column 'away' for 0-0.\n- Row 3: column 'away' for showing the higher score than claimed.\n\nThus, these are the relevant cells to assess the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the highest away score in the 2001-02 season was actually 4-1, not 3-1.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"when the club be st gallen the season be 2013 - 14 and when the club be slavia prague the season be 1995 - 96\". So, it's stating two separate conditions. The first part is about 'st gallen' being in the 2013-14 season, and the second part is about 'slavia prague' being in the 1995-96 season.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll need to check each row for these two clubs and their corresponding seasons. Let's go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Club is Slavia Prague. The season here is 1995-96. This matches the second part of the claim where Slavia Prague is in the 1995-96 season. So, that seems correct.\n\nNow, checking for St Gallen. Let's look through each row:\n\nRow 2: Matador P\u00fachov - not relevant.\nRow 3: St Gallen. The season here is 2001-02. Wait a minute, the claim says St Gallen was in the 2013-14 season, but according to this table, they were in 2001-02. That's different from what the claim states.\n\nRows 4 to 7: The other rows don't mention St Gallen at all. So, the only occurrence of St Gallen is in Row 3 with the 2001-02 season, not 2013-14 as the claim suggests.\n\nSo, breaking it down:\n- Slavia Prague (Row 1) correctly has the 1995-96 season. That part of the claim holds.\n- St Gallen (Row 3) is in the 2001-02 season, not 2013-14 as claimed. This part does not hold.\n\nSince one part of the claim is true and the other isn't, but the claim connects them with \"and\", meaning both conditions need to be true for the entire statement to be TRUE. Since St Gallen's season doesn't match, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n- For Slavia Prague: Row 1 has club as 'slavia prague' and season 1995-96.\n- For St Gallen: Row 3 shows the club 'st gallen' with a different season (2001-02), which contradicts the claim.\n\nSo, these are the relevant cells to evaluate the claim. Since one part is correct but the other isn't, the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"season\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nThe claim states: \"sc freiburg play in thesecond round on 2 occasion in the uefa cup competition in season 1995-96 and 2001-02.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down what needs to be checked:\n1. Are there two occasions where SC Freiburg played in the second round of the UEFA Cup?\n2. Do these occasions fall in the seasons 1995-96 and 2001-02?\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nRow 1: Season 1995-96, Competition UEFA Cup, Round first round. Club is Slavia Prague. So, not SC Freiburg.\n\nRow 2: Season 2001-02, Competition UEFA Cup, Round first round. Club is Matador P\u00fachov. Again, not SC Freiburg.\n\nRow 3: Season 2001-02, Competition UEFA Cup, Round second round. Club is St Gallen. Still not SC Freiburg.\n\nRow 4: Season 2001-02, Competition UEFA Cup, Round third round. Club is Feyenoord. Not relevant.\n\nRows 5,6,7: These are from the 2013-14 season and involve the UEFA Europa League, which isn't the same as the UEFA Cup. So, irrelevant for this claim.\n\nNowhere in the table do I see SC Freiburg mentioned. The clubs listed are Slavia Prague, Matador P\u00fachov, St Gallen, Feyenoord, Sevilla, Estoril, and Slovan Liberec. There's no entry for SC Freiburg in either of the seasons mentioned (1995-96 or 2001-02), nor are they listed in any round of the UEFA Cup.\n\nTherefore, since there's no evidence of SC Freiburg participating in the second round of the UEFA Cup during those seasons, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not list SC Freiburg in any relevant season or round for the claim. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
