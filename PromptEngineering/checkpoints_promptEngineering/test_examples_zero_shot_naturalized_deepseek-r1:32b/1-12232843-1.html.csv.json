    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the claim step by step and see if it holds true based on the provided table.\n\nThe claim is: \"there be 1 woman's double team consist of kerry ann sheppard and carolina harvey when jamie van hooijdonk compete in the men's single.\"\n\nFirst, I need to identify two main parts here:\n1. Identify a season where Jamie Van Hooijdonk competed in Men's Singles.\n2. In that same season, check if the Women's Doubles team was Kerry Ann Sheppard and Carolina Harvey.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 9 (season 2008) has \"jamie van hooijdonk\" listed under Men's Singles. So that's our target row for part 1.\n\nNow, in the same row (row 9), I check the Women's Doubles column. It says \"vikki jones nicole walkley.\" Neither of these names is Kerry Ann Sheppard or Carolina Harvey. \n\nTherefore, even though Jamie Van Hooijdonk was in Men's Singles in 2008, the Women's Doubles team that season doesn't include the two specified players.\n\nSo, the claim isn't supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"men's singles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"womens doubles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"the women's double team, kerry ann sheppard and caroline harvey compete in the same year as when jamie van hooijdonk competes in men's singles.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify the key pieces of information needed:\n1. The year when Jamie Van Hooijdonk competed in Men's Singles.\n2. The year when Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey were the Women's Doubles team.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- For the Men's Singles: I'll scan each row to find Jamie Van Hooijdonk. \n  - Row 10 (Season 2009) shows Jamie Van Hooijdonk in Men's Singles.\n  \n- Now, for the Women's Doubles team of Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey:\n  - I'll check each row under \"womens doubles\" to see if they are listed together.\n  - Scanning through rows, I find that Row 10 (Season 2009) lists \"kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey\" in the womens doubles column.\n\nSince both Jamie Van Hooijdonk's Men's Singles and the women's doubles team of Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey are listed in Season 2009, they competed in the same year. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n- For Jamie Van Hooijdonk: row_index 10 (assuming rows start at 0), column \"mens singles\".\nWait, actually looking back, in the provided table, Row 10 corresponds to season 2009. So the row indices are from 0 to 10? Let me recount:\n\nRows:\nRow 1: 2000\nRow 2: 2001\n...\nRow 10: 2009\n\nWait, in the initial table, Row 1 is season 2000, so row indices are from 1 to 11? Or does it start at 0? The user provided rows as Row 1, Row 2, etc., up to Row 11. But when indexing, in programming terms, they usually start at 0. However, the way the question is presented, each row is listed as Row 1 through Row 11.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the first row (Row 1) as index 0? Or maybe it's 1-based. The example given in the instructions uses \"row_0\". Wait no, looking back at the user instruction: In the example, they have row_index as 0 and 1, so probably considering rows starting from 0.\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\nThe table is presented with Row 1 to Row 11. So if we consider each \"Row x\" as index x-1 in a zero-based system.\n\nSo for Season 2009, that's Row 10 (since Row 1 is 2000, so Row 10 would be 2009). Therefore, row_index is 10 - 1 = 9? Wait no: Let me count:\n\nRow 1: 2000 \u2192 index 0\nRow 2: 2001 \u2192 index 1\n...\nRow 10: 2009 \u2192 index 9\nRow 11: 2010 \u2192 index 10\n\nSo in row 10 (index 9), we have:\n\nmens singles: jamie van hooijdonk\nwomens doubles: kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- Row index 9 (Season 2009) for both \"mens singles\" and \"womens doubles\".\n\nSo two objects in relevant_cells:\n{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"}\nand\n{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"womens doubles\"}\n\nWait, but the example shows that it's a list of each cell. So yes, both these cells are needed to confirm the claim.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- The relevant_cells include the men's singles and women's doubles from row index 9.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"womens doubles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"there be zero woman's double team that compete when jamie van hooijdonk compete\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It states that whenever Jamie Van Hooijdonk competed in the men's singles category, there were no women's doubles teams competing. So I need to check if in any row where Jamie Van Hooijdonk is listed as the men's singles champion, the women's doubles column shows zero or no entries.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a season from 2000 to 2010. The columns include Season, Men's Singles, Women's Singles, Men's Doubles, Women's Doubles, and Mixed Doubles.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- **Row 1 (2000)**: Men's Singles is Richard Vaughan. Not Jamie Van Hooijdonk. So irrelevant.\n  \n- **Row 2 (2001)**: Again, Men's Singles is Richard Vaughan. Irrelevant.\n\n- **Row 3 (2002)**: Men's Singles still Richard Vaughan. No Jamie here.\n\n- **Row 4 (2003)**: Men's Singles is Irwansyah. Not relevant.\n\n- **Row 5 (2004)**: Men's Singles is Irwansyah again. Still not the target.\n\n- **Row 6 (2005)**: Paul Le Tocq in Men's Singles. No match.\n\n- **Row 7 (2006)**: Martyn Lewis as Men's Singles champion. Not relevant.\n\n- **Row 8 (2007)**: Raj Popat is the Men's Singles player. Not Jamie.\n\n- **Row 9 (2008)**: Martyn Lewis again. Still not the target.\n\n- **Row 10 (2009)**: Here, Men's Singles is Jamie Van Hooijdonk. So this row is relevant. Now I need to check the Women's Doubles column in this row. It says \"vikki jones nicole walkley\". That means there were two women competing in doubles.\n\n- **Row 11 (2010)**: Men's Singles is Irwansyah again. Not relevant.\n\nFrom this analysis, the only time Jamie Van Hooijdonk competed was in the 2009 season (Row 10). In that same row, the Women's Doubles column shows two competitors. Therefore, there were women competing in doubles when Jamie was in Men's Singles.\n\nSince the claim says \"zero woman's double team\" during his competition, but we found a team did compete, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because in 2009, when Jamie Van Hooijdonk competed, there were women's doubles teams. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"womens doubles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
