    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"when m night shyamalan be the director, the rank be 7.\" So I need to check in the table where M Night Shyamalan is listed as a director and see what his rank was.\n\nLooking through each row of the table:\n\nRow 1: Director is Peter Jackson. Not Shyamalan.\nRow 2: Chris Columbus. Nope.\nRow 3: Sam Raimi. No.\nRow 4: George Lucas. Still not.\nRow 5: Barry Sonnenfeld. Not him either.\nRow 6: Lee Tamahori. No match.\nRow 7: M Night Shyamalan! Okay, so this is the relevant row. The rank here is 7. So according to the table, when he directed, the film was ranked 7th.\n\nI don't see any other rows where Shyamalan is listed as a director in this table. So based on this data, the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that when M Night Shyamalan is the director, his movie's rank is 7. Checking the table, row 7 has M Night Shyamalan as the director and a rank of 7.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"director(s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"george lucas be the director for star war episode ii : attack of the clone\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the table and look for the relevant information. The table has multiple rows, each with details about different movies. Each row includes columns like rank, title, studio, director(s), and worldwide gross.\n\nThe claim is about George Lucas directing \"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones.\" So my first task is to locate this specific movie in the table. I'll scan through the titles looking for something that matches.\n\nLooking at row 4: The title is \"star wars episode ii : attack of the clones\" and the director(s) listed are George Lucas. That's a direct match with what the claim states.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure there aren't any other entries for Star Wars Episode II elsewhere in the table that might have a different director. Scanning through the rest of the rows, I don't see another entry for this specific movie. So row 4 is the only one relevant here.\n\nNow, the claim says George Lucas directed it, and according to row 4, column \"director(s)\", that's exactly what's stated. Therefore, the claim aligns with the information in the table.\n\nSo, putting it together: The claim matches the director listed for Star Wars Episode II in the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table where George Lucas is listed as the director of \"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones.\"\n\n**Answer:**  \n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"director(s)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"star war episode ii : attack of the clone be develop by barry sonnenfeld for universal picture\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the key elements in the claim: the movie title, the director, and the studio. The claim states that \"Star War Episode II : Attack of the Clone\" was developed (I assume they mean directed) by Barry Sonnenfeld for Universal Picture.\n\nLooking through the table rows to find the relevant information. I'll search for the movie titled \"star wars episode ii: attack of the clones.\" Scanning through the rows, I see that Row 4 has this title. Let me check what details are provided there.\n\nRow 4 shows:\n- Rank: 4\n- Title: star wars episode ii : attack of the clones\n- Studio: 20th century fox / lucasfilm\n- Director(s): george lucas\n- Worldwide gross: 649398328\n\nFrom this, I can see that the director is listed as George Lucas, not Barry Sonnenfeld. Also, the studio is 20th Century Fox and Lucasfilm, not Universal Picture.\n\nNow, checking if Barry Sonnenfeld directed any movie in the table. Looking through the directors' names, Row 5 mentions \"barry sonnenfeld\" directing \"men in black ii.\" So Barry was involved with that film, but it's a different title and studio (Columbia Pictures).\n\nTherefore, the claim incorrectly attributes both the director and the studio to Star Wars Episode II. The correct director is George Lucas, and the studio is 20th Century Fox/Lucasfilm.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because \"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones\" was directed by George Lucas, not Barry Sonnenfeld, and produced by 20th Century Fox/Lucasfilm, not Universal Picture. The relevant cells are from Row 4.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"director(s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"studio\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
