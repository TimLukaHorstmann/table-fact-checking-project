Looking at Row 5, under 'primary conference' it says mid - hoosier.\n\nThe claim states that North Decatur does not have Ohio River Valley as their primary conference.

Therefore, the statement is TRUE.\n\nTo verify, I'll cross-check with other rows to ensure no other schools are named North Decatur or if there's any conflicting information.

The relevant column here is \"enrollment\". \n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 1: Eastern Hancock has an enrollment of 348.\n- Row 2: Indian Creek has an enrollment of 598.\n- Row 3: Knightstown has an enrollment of 397.\n- Row 4: Milan has an enrollment of 417.\n- Row 5: North Decatur has an enrollment of 397.\n- Row 6: South Decatur has an enrollment of 316.\n\nNow, I'll compare the enrollment numbers.

Scanning through the enrollments: 348, 598, 397, 417, 397, 316. The next highest is 417 (Milan), which is less than 598.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It says that Indian Creek is one of three schools located in Greensburg. So I need to check how many schools are listed as being in Greensburg and see if Indian Creek is among them, making it one out of three.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a school with various details like location, enrollment, etc. Let's go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Eastern Hancock is in Charlottesville.\nRow 2: Indian Creek is in Trafalgar.\nWait, that doesn't seem right because the claim mentions Greensburg. Did I read that correctly? Let me check again.\n\nNo, wait. The table actually says Row 2: school Indian Creek, location Trafalgar. So Indian Creek isn't in Greensburg at all according to this data. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's double-check the other rows.\n\nRow 3: Knightstown is in Knightstown.\nRow 4: Milan is in Milan.\nRow 5: North Decatur is in Greensburg.\nRow 6: South Decatur is in Greensburg.\n\nSo from Rows 5 and 6, we have two schools in Greensburg: North Decatur and South Decatur. Indian Creek is in Trafalgar, so it's not in Greensburg. Therefore, there are only two schools listed as being in Greensburg, not three. The claim says Indian Creek is one of three, but according to the table, that's incorrect.\n\nWait a second, maybe I missed another school in Greensburg. Let me go through all rows again:\n\nRow 1: Charlottesville\nRow 2: Trafalgar\nRow 3: Knightstown\nRow 4: Milan\nRow 5: Greensburg (North Decatur)\nRow 6: Greensburg (South Decatur)\n\nNo, only two schools are in Greensburg. So the claim is wrong because it mentions three schools, including Indian Creek, which isn't even located there. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells to support this conclusion:\n\n- For Indian Creek's location: Row 2, column \"location\"\n- For North Decatur's location: Row 5, column \"location\"\n- For South Decatur's location: Row 6, column \"location\"\n\nThese three cells show that only two schools are in Greensburg, and Indian Creek isn't one of them.

The table has six rows, each representing a different school with various details like location, mascot, enrollment, etc. Each row also includes the 'primary conference' which seems relevant here since the claim is about that specific detail.\n\nThe claim mentions two schools: north decatur and milan. I need to check their primary conferences.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- Row 5 is school: north decatur. Its primary conference is listed as \"mid - hoosier\".\n- Row 4 is school: milan.

Milan, on the other hand, does have ohio river valley as its primary conference.\n\nSince north decatur doesn't share that conference with milan, the claim isn't fully supported.

Comparing that to Indian Creek's 598, it's clear that South Decatur has a lower enrollment.\n\nWait, but the claim says Indian Creek has the least. Since South Decatur is lower, the claim must be false. I should also make sure there are no other schools with enrollments between 316 and 598.
