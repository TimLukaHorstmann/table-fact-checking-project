    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim about Joliette is true or false based on the given table. The claim says that \"joliette have 0.771 square mile of water, and can be find with geo id 3806741020.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the table to find the one that mentions Joliette. Scanning through rows 1 to 9, I see that row 9 is about Joliette. Okay, so Joliette is in row 9.\n\nNext, the claim mentions two specific pieces of information: the amount of water and the geo ID. So I need to check both of these against row 9.\n\nLooking at the columns for row 9, I see:\n- Township: joliette\n- County: pembina\n- Pop (2010): 67\n- Land (sqmi): 70.044\n- Water (sqmi): 0.771\n- Latitude: 48.796545\n- Longitude: -97.217227\n- Geo id: 3806741020\n- Ansi code: 1036723\n\nThe claim states that the water area is 0.771 sqmi, which matches exactly with the \"water (sqmi)\" value in row 9. That's good so far.\n\nThen, the claim mentions the geo ID as 3806741020. Looking at the \"geo id\" column in row 9, it's also 3806741020. So that matches too.\n\nI should make sure there are no other rows with Joliette to avoid confusion. Scanning through again, I don't see any other entries named Joliette except row 9. That confirms that this is the correct entry.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are accurate based on row 9's data. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"water (sqmi)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"geo id\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the geo id for janke township in logan county be 3804740620\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the claim. It states that the Geo ID for Janke Township located in Logan County should be 3804740620. My task is to verify this against the data provided in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several rows with different townships and their corresponding details. Each row includes information like township name, county, population (pop), land area, water area, latitude, longitude, Geo ID, and ANSI code.\n\nI need to find the row that corresponds to Janke Township in Logan County. Let's go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Jackson Township, Sargent County. Not relevant.\nRow 2: James Hill Township, Mountrail County. Not relevant.\nRow 3: James River Valley Township, Dickey County. No match for Janke or Logan.\nRow 4: Janke Township, Logan County. This seems to be the row we're interested in.\nRow 5 onwards: Other townships not matching Janke.\n\nSo, focusing on Row 4: It states that Janke Township is in Logan County. The Geo ID provided here is 3804740620.\n\nThe claim says exactly this: Geo ID for Janke Township in Logan County is 3804740620. Comparing the two, they match perfectly. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant to verify this claim. The key pieces of information needed are:\n\n1. The township name: \"janke\" (case-insensitive)\n2. The county: \"logan\"\n3. The Geo ID associated with that row.\n\nLooking at Row 4, the columns involved would be:\n- \"township\": to confirm it's Janke\n- \"county\": to confirm it's Logan County\n- \"geo id\": to get the specific ID\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are in row index 3 (since rows start from 0), with column names: township, county, and geo id.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at how the table is structured, each row is indexed starting from 1. But in the problem statement, the rows are given as Row 1 through Row 9. However, when considering JSON output, it's better to use 0-based indexing because that's standard in programming contexts.\n\nWait no, let me check again. The user provided the table with rows labeled as Row 1 to Row 9. So for row indices, they are likely using 1-based numbering here. But in programming, usually, we start from 0. However, in the example given by the user, the JSON response shows \"row_index\": 0 and 1, which implies that the rows are treated as starting from 0.\n\nWait no, actually, looking at the example provided:\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_ cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Employees\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nSo in this case, row indices start from 0. Therefore, Row 1 would be index 0, Row 2 as index 1, and so on.\n\nWait no, that can't be right because in the example, they have two rows: first row (index 0) and second row (index 1). So perhaps the initial table provided by the user is listed as Row 1 to Row 9, but for JSON output, it's better to map them as starting from index 0. Therefore, Janke Township in Logan County is in Row 4 of the given data, which would be row_index: 3.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me recount:\n\nThe user provided rows as \"Row 1\", \"Row 2\", up to \"Row 9\". So when referring to them in JSON, they should map directly as such. But looking at the example given by the user, it seems that row indices are treated as starting from 0.\n\nWait no, perhaps not. Let me check:\n\nIn the example, the claim was about two rows, and the relevant cells were indexed 0 and 1. So perhaps in their context, the first row is index 0.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, I'll proceed with the given data as per user's presentation.\n\nSo Janke Township is in Row 4 (as provided by the user), which would be the fourth entry after starting from Row 1. Therefore, the row index for JSON purposes should be 3 (since it starts at 0).\n\nBut to confirm, I'll list out:\n\nRow 1: Index 0\nRow 2: Index 1\nRow 3: Index 2\nRow 4: Index 3\n\nYes, so Row 4 is row_index: 3.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are in row 3 (index 3) for the columns \"township\", \"county\", and \"geo id\".\n\nWait, but does the column names exactly match? Looking back at the table, the headers are:\n\n- township\n- county\n- pop\n- land\n- water\n- latitude\n- longitude\n- geo id\n- ansi code\n\nSo yes, the exact column name is \"geo id\" with a space.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells to verify the claim would be:\n\n- row_index: 3 (since Row 4 is index 3 in 0-based)\n- column_name: \"township\"\n- column_name: \"county\"\n- column_name: \"geo id\"\n\nBut wait, the user's example only included two columns. Perhaps for brevity, but in this case, to fully verify, we need all three.\n\nWait no, actually, perhaps it's sufficient to include just the \"geo id\" cell because the claim is about that specific value. But since the claim refers to a specific township and county, I think including all three columns (township, county, geo id) from row 3 would be appropriate to show how we arrived at confirming the claim.\n\nBut in the example provided by the user, they included two cells: Revenue and Employees for rows 0 and 1. So perhaps it's about identifying which specific cells were used to confirm each part of the claim.\n\nIn this case, the claim is that \"the geo id for janke township in logan county be 3804740620\". To verify, we need to ensure:\n\n- The row has \"janke\" as the township.\n- It's located in \"logan\" county.\n- Its Geo ID is 3804740620.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\nFor Janke Township: row_index 3, column_name \"township\"\nFor Logan County: same row, column_name \"county\"\nGeo ID value: same row, column_name \"geo id\"\n\nSo in total, three relevant cells from the same row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the Geo ID for Janke Township in Logan County matches exactly with the data provided. The relevant cells are found in Row 4 (0-based index 3) under the columns \"township\", \"county\", and \"geo id\".\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_ cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"township\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"county\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"geo id\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"grand fork county have 36.199 square mile of land.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse this correctly. It seems like the claim is stating that Grand Fork County has a land area of 36.199 square miles. Now, looking at the table provided, each row represents different townships along with their respective counties and other details.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to find any mention of \"grand fork\" or \"Grand Forks.\" Let's see:\n\nRow 1: Township is Jackson in Sargent County.\nRow 2: James Hill in Mountrail County.\nRow 3: James River Valley in Dickey County.\nRow 4: Janke in Logan County.\nRow 5: Jefferson in Pierce County.\nRow 6: Jim River Valley in Stutsman County.\nRow 7: Johnson in Wells County.\nRow 8: Johnstown in Grand Forks County. Here, I see \"Grand Fork\" mentioned as the county for this row.\nRow 9: Joliette in Pembina County.\n\nSo, Row 8 is about Grand Forks County. Now, checking the land area for this row. The table shows 'land (sqmi)' as 36.199. That matches exactly with what the claim states.\n\nWait a minute, but let me make sure. The claim says \"Grand fork county,\" which might be a typo for Grand Forks County since that's how it's listed in the table. So the land area is indeed 36.199 square miles as per Row 8.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the data in the table supports it.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Grand Forks County has 36.199 sqmi of land.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"joliette township have a geo id of 3806741020\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is saying. It states that the township named Joliette has a specific Geo ID, which is 3806741020. My job is to check this against the data provided in the table and see if it's accurate.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice there are multiple rows, each representing different townships with various attributes like county, population, land area, water area, latitude, longitude, geo id, and ansi code. Each row is numbered from 1 to 9, but when accessing data in programming or structured formats, indices usually start at 0. However, the problem mentions \"row_index\" as integers, so I assume they are referring to the position starting from 1 for Row 1.\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to find the row where the township is Joliette and check its Geo ID. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Township is Jackson.\n- Row 2: James Hill.\n- Row 3: James River Valley.\n- Row 4: Janke.\n- Row 5: Jefferson.\n- Row 6: Jim River Valley.\n- Row 7: Johnson.\n- Row 8: Johnstown.\n- Row 9: Joliette.\n\nAh, here we go. The ninth row mentions the township as Joliette. Now, I need to check the Geo ID for this row. Looking at the data provided, under the Geo ID column for Joliette, it's listed as 3806741020. \n\nThat matches exactly with what the claim states. Therefore, the information in the table supports the claim.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells that were checked to arrive at this conclusion:\n\n- The township name (Joliette) was found in row 9.\n- The corresponding Geo ID for that row is also in row 9.\n\nTherefore, these are the two cells that matter for verifying the claim.

I need to determine whether the claim about James Hill Township is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"james hill township have 4.243 sqmi of water and a latitude of 48.423125.\" So, there are two parts to this claim that need verification\u2014water area and latitude.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different township. I'll scan through each row until I find \"james hill\" as the township name. Scanning Row 1: Jackson, Row 2: James Hill. Okay, so James Hill is in Row 2.\n\nNow, let's check the water area for James Hill Township. The claim states it has 4.243 sqmi of water. In the table, under 'water (sqmi)' for Row 2, I see the value 4.243. That matches exactly with the claim. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, verifying the latitude. The claim says the latitude is 48.423125. Looking at the 'latitude' column in Row 2, it's listed as 48.423125. Again, this matches precisely with what's stated in the claim.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are accurately represented in the table for James Hill Township, there doesn't seem to be any discrepancy.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"the township that have 28.597 sqmi land be that of james river valley\". \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that the township with exactly 28.597 square miles of land area is named James River Valley. So I need to check two things: does a township in the table have 28.597 sqmi of land, and if so, is its name indeed James River Valley?\n\nLooking at the table structure provided, each row represents a different township with various attributes like county, population, land area, water area, etc. The columns are: township, county, pop (2010), land (sqmi), water (sqmi), latitude, longitude, geo id, ansi code.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to find where the land area is 28.597 sqmi.\n\nRow 1: Land area is 35.809 sqmi \u2013 not matching.\nRow 2: Land area is 31.82 sqmi \u2013 nope.\nRow 3: Land area is 28.597 sqmi. Okay, this matches the claim. Now I need to check the township name here. The township for row 3 is James River Valley. That's exactly what the claim states.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me check the remaining rows in case there are any other townships with 28.597 sqmi land area.\n\nRow 4: 35.995 sqmi \u2013 no.\nRow 5: 35.069 sqmi \u2013 nope.\nRow 6: 34.134 sqmi \u2013 still not.\nRow 7: 35.299 sqmi \u2013 no match.\nRow 8: 36.199 sqmi \u2013 no.\nRow 9: 70.044 sqmi \u2013 definitely not.\n\nSo the only row with land area 28.597 is row 3, and that's for James River Valley. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells are in row 3, specifically the 'land (sqmi)' column where it's 28.597 and the 'township' column which is James River Valley.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table has information about different townships with various attributes like population, land area, water area, latitude, longitude, geo id, and ansi code.\n\nThe claim is: \"the geo id for a township with 0.717 square mile of water be 3806741020.\" \n\nHmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step. First, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that there's a township with exactly 0.717 square miles of water area, and for that particular township, the geo id should be 3806741020.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different township with its respective details. The columns are: township name, county, population (2010), land area in square miles, water area in square miles, latitude, longitude, geo id, and ansi code.\n\nSo, to verify this claim, I need to find if there's any row where the water area is exactly 0.717 sqmi, and then check if that row has a geo id of 3806741020.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Water area is 0.0 sqmi.\nRow 2: Water area is 4.243 sqmi.\nRow 3: Water area is 0.0 sqmi.\nRow 4: Water area is 0.163 sqmi.\nRow 5: Water area is 1.125 sqmi.\nRow 6: Water area is 1.746 sqmi.\nRow 7: Water area is 0.908 sqmi.\nRow 8: Water area is 0.0 sqmi.\nRow 9: Water area is 0.771 sqmi.\n\nWait a minute, none of the rows have exactly 0.717 sqmi for water area. The closest one is Row 9 with 0.771 sqmi. So, that's not matching. Therefore, there's no township in this table with exactly 0.717 square miles of water.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check the geo ids as well. Maybe I misread something. The claim mentions the geo id is 3806741020. Looking at each row's geo id:\n\nRow 1: 3808140460\nRow 2: 3806140500\nRow 3: 3802140540\nRow 4: 3804740620\nRow 5: 3806940700\nRow 6: 3809340780\nRow 7: 3810340820\nRow 8: 3803540940\nRow 9: 3806741020\n\nOh, so Row 9 does have the geo id mentioned in the claim. However, as I noted earlier, the water area for Row 9 is 0.771 sqmi, not 0.717. \n\nSo, putting it together: The claim says that a township with 0.717 sqmi of water has the geo id 3806741020. But in reality, the township with that geo id (Row 9) has 0.771 sqmi of water. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because the water area doesn't match.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if any other row has a water area close to 0.717. Let me look again:\n\n- Row 4: 0.163\n- Row 5: 1.125\n- Row 6: 1.746\n- Row 7: 0.908\n- Row 9: 0.771\n\nThe closest is Row 9, but it's still not exactly 0.717. So no row matches the exact water area specified in the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because there's no township with exactly 0.717 sqmi of water and the corresponding geo id.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because none of the townships have exactly 0.717 square miles of water. The closest match has 0.771 sqmi, which doesn't meet the condition.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"water\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"geo id\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It's stating that the geo ID corresponding to Dickey County should be 3804740620. So, my task is to check if this statement is true or false based on the given table.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row in the table to find which one mentions Dickey County.

Now, does any other row have the same geo ID as claimed?\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\n- Row 1: 3808140460\n- Row 2: 3806140500\n- Row 3: 3802140540\n- Row 4: 3804740620\n- Row 5: 3806940700\n- Row 6: 3809340780\n- Row 7: 3810340820\n- Row 8: 3803540940\n- Row 9: 3806741020\n\nAh, I see that the geo ID 3804740620 is actually present in row 4. Let me check what county that's for. Row 4 is Janke Township in Logan County.\n\nSo, the claim says Dickey County has geo ID 3804740620, but according to the table:\n\n- Dickey County (row 3) has geo ID 3802140540\n- Logan County (row 4) has geo ID 3804740620\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect. The correct geo ID for Dickey County is different from what's claimed.\n\nTo sum up:\n\n- Checked each row to find Dickey County.\n- Found it in row 3 with a different geo ID.\n- Verified that the claimed geo ID belongs to another county (Logan).\n- Concluded the claim is false.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are the ones showing the actual geo ID for Dickey County in row 3 and perhaps where the incorrect ID appears, but since the instruction says to list only the relevant cells for verifying the claim, which is row 3's county and geo ID.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"county\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"geo id\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the geo id for johnstown be 3810340820.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table to find where the township is named Johnstown.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"james hill have the least amount of land (sqmi)\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that the township named James Hill has the smallest land area in square miles among all the townships listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different township with various details including the 'land (sqmi)' column. So my main focus should be on comparing the values under this column for each township to see if James Hill indeed has the least.\n\nLet me list out the relevant information:\n\n1. **Township Names and Land Area:**\n   - Row 1: Jackson, Sargent County \u2013 Land: 35.809 sqmi\n   - Row 2: James Hill, Mountrail County \u2013 Land: 31.82 sqmi\n   - Row 3: James River Valley, Dickey County \u2013 Land: 28.597 sqmi\n   - Row 4: Janke, Logan County \u2013 Land: 35.995 sqmi\n   - Row 5: Jefferson, Pierce County \u2013 Land: 35.069 sqmi\n   - Row 6: Jim River Valley, Stutsman County \u2013 Land: 34.134 sqmi\n   - Row 7: Johnson, Wells County \u2013 Land: 35.299 sqmi\n   - Row 8: Johnstown, Grand Forks County \u2013 Land: 36.199 sqmi\n   - Row 9: Joliette, Pembina County \u2013 Land: 70.044 sqmi\n\nNow, I need to identify the smallest value in the 'land (sqmi)' column.\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n\n- The smallest land area is 28.597 sqmi for James River Valley.\n- Next comes James Hill with 31.82 sqmi.\n- Then Janke has 35.995, followed by others like Jefferson and Johnson, which are around 35 sqmi.\n\nSo, the smallest is James River Valley at 28.597, then James Hill next. Therefore, James Hill doesn't have the least; it's second to last in terms of land area.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe I should double-check all rows to make sure I didn't miss any smaller value. Let me go through each row again:\n\n- Row 1: 35.809 \u2013 no\n- Row 2: 31.82 \u2013 yes\n- Row 3: 28.597 \u2013 that's smaller than James Hill\n- The rest are higher or in the same range.\n\nSo, yes, James River Valley has less land than James Hill. Therefore, the claim that James Hill has the least is FALSE because another township (James River Valley) has a smaller land area.\n\nTo make sure I'm not making any mistake, let me list all the land areas in order:\n\n1. 28.597 (Row3: James River Valley)\n2. 31.82 (Row2: James Hill)\n3. 34.134 (Row6: Jim River Valley)\n4. 35.069 (Row5: Jefferson)\n5. 35.299 (Row7: Johnson)\n6. 35.809 (Row1: Jackson)\n7. 35.995 (Row4: Janke)\n8. 36.199 (Row8: Johnstown)\n9. 70.044 (Row9: Joliette)\n\nSo, the order from smallest to largest shows that James River Valley is indeed the smallest. Therefore, the claim about James Hill is incorrect.\n\nI think I have considered all relevant data points and cross-verified them. So my conclusion is that the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is evaluated by comparing the 'land (sqmi)' values of each township. The smallest value is found in James River Valley with 28.597 sqmi, which is less than James Hill's 31.82 sqmi. Thus, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"land (sqmi)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"land (sqmi)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this table with some data about townships and various attributes like population, land area, water area, latitude, longitude, etc. The claim is that the latitude for the township named \"janke\" is \"-97.945530\". I need to figure out if this is true or false by checking against the table.\n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table to find where the township name is \"janke\". Let me go through them one by one:\n\n- Row 1: Township is jackson. Not janke.\n- Row 2: James hill. Nope.\n- Row 3: james river valley. Still not.\n- Row 4: Janke! Okay, this is the row we need to check.\n\nNow that I've found the row for janke (Row 4), I need to look at the latitude value in that row. The claim says the latitude should be -97.945530. Let's see what the table shows for Row 4.\n\nLooking at the data: latitude is listed as 46.415512, longitude is -99.131701. Wait a minute, that doesn't match. The claim mentions \"-97.945530\", but looking back, actually, I might have made a mistake here.\n\nWait no, the latitude in Row 4 is 46.415512, not -97... So maybe I confused latitude with longitude? Let me double-check the table structure to make sure which column is which. The columns are: township, county, pop (2010), land (sqmi), water (sqmi), latitude, longitude, geo id, ansi code.\n\nSo, in Row 4, the latitude is indeed 46.415512 and the longitude is -99.131701. The claim states that the latitude for janke is \"-97.945530\". But according to the table, the latitude is 46.415512, which is a positive number around 46 degrees north. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the claim. Let me read it again: \"the latitude for the township janke be -97.945530\". That would mean the latitude is negative 97 degrees, which doesn't make sense because latitudes range from -90 to 90 degrees. But looking at Row 4's latitude, it's 46.415512, not anywhere near -97.\n\nHold on, perhaps I should check if another row has a longitude of -97.945530? Let me see:\n\n- Row 1: Longitude is -97.945530\n- So the claim might have mixed up latitude and longitude for janke?\n\nWait no, because in the table, Row 1 (jackson) has a longitude of -97.945530. The claim says that the latitude for janke is that number, which is incorrect.\n\nSo putting it all together: Janke's latitude is 46.415512, and its longitude is -99.131701. The claim incorrectly states the latitude as -97.945530, which actually belongs to Row 1's longitude. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells are:\n- For janke (Row 4), the latitude column.\n- Maybe also checking where \"-97.945530\" appears, which is in Row 1's longitude.\n\nSo I'll note that the relevant cells are the latitude from Row 4 and perhaps the longitude from Row 1 to show the confusion, but since the claim specifically mentions janke's latitude, only that cell is necessary for verifying.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the latitude for \"janke\" is \"-97.945530\". Checking the table:\n\n- In Row 4 (janke), the latitude is listed as 46.415512, not -97.945530.\n\nThus, the claim is false because it incorrectly attributes the longitude of another row to janke's latitude.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE  \n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Row 4 (janke) under \"latitude\"\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"latitude\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
