    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the brighton hotel bombing happen in brighton , uk\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find an event related to the Brighton Hotel Bombing. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Attack on Mosel Ship\n- Row 2: Los Angeles Times bombing\n- ...\n- Row 8: United Airlines Flight 629\n- ...\n- Row 14: Brighton hotel bombing\n\nAh, there it is in Row 14. Now, I need to verify the details of this event. The claim states that theBrighton Hotel Bombing happened in Brighton, UK.\n\nLooking at Row 14:\n\n- Year: 1984\n- Event: Brighton hotel bombing\n- Location: Brighton , uk\n- Perpetrator(s): IRA\n- Deaths: 5\n\nSo, the location is indeed listed as \"Brighton , uk\". That matches exactly with what's stated in the claim. The event name also matches, so there's no confusion here.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are correctly supported by the data in Row 14. There's nothing conflicting or missing that would make this claim false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately reflects the information in the table. The relevant cell is in Row 14 under 'location' which confirms the event took place in Brighton, UK.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"brighton hotel bombing happen in enniskillen , uk\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim is referring to.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two specific events: the Brighton Hotel Bombing and its location as Enniskillen, UK. I need to check these details against the table data.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 23 rows, each with information about different events including the year, event name, location, perpetrator(s), and number of deaths. My goal is to find any row that mentions both \"Brighton Hotel Bombing\" and its location as Enniskillen, UK.\n\nI'll go through the table row by row:\n\n- Row 15: Event is \"brighton hotel bombing,\" located in Brighton, UK. The perpetrators are IRA with 5 deaths.\n- Other rows mention events like \"enniskillen bombing\" but that's a different event at a different location and year (Row 16).\n\nWait, actually looking again, Row 16 is the Remembrance Day Bombing in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland, by IRA with 12 deaths. But this isn't called the \"Brighton Hotel Bombing.\" The Brighton Hotel Bombing specifically refers to an event in Brighton, not Enniskillen.\n\nSo the claim says that the Brighton Hotel Bombing happened in Enniskillen, UK. However, according to the table, the Brighton Hotel Bombing is located in Brighton, UK (Row 15), and the event in Enniskillen (Row 16) is a different bombing. Therefore, the claim mixes up two separate events.\n\nThus, the claim is incorrect because the Brighton Hotel Bombing didn't occur in Enniskillen; it happened in Brighton. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that the Brighton Hotel Bombing occurred in Enniskillen, UK. According to the table, the Brighton Hotel Bombing took place in Brighton (Row 15), while the event in Enniskillen was a separate bombing on Remembrance Day (Row 16). \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
