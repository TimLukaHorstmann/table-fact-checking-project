Since there are 5 rows (teams) in the table, we can check each team's performance across all games.\n\n2. Analyze each team's results by examining their wins, losses, draws, points difference, and total points. A team that has lost every game will have a 'lost' value greater than 0 for all four games and a 'points' value of 0.\n\n3. Examine the table row-by-row to see if any team meets this criteria:\n   - Row 1: The team has won 1 game, so they do not meet the criteria.\n   - Row 2: The team has lost 1 game and drawn one game, so they do not meet the criteria.\n   - Row 3: The team has lost 1 game, so they do not meet the criteria.\n   - Row 4: The team has lost 3 games, but it is possible for a team to win at least one game and still have no points if they lose more games or have a larger negative points difference. We'll investigate this further by checking the 'points difference.' If the total points scored against them (sum of their opponents' goals) is greater than the sum of the points they've scored themselves, then they meet the criteria for the claim. Looking at the table: 27 > 03, which means this team does not meet the criteria.\n   - Row 5: The team has lost all four games and has a 'points' value of 0, indicating that they have no points.
