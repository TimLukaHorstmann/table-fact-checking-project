Identify the task at hand: The question asks whether Heikki Riihijarvi was the last player chosen from Finland, so we need to compare the row where he is listed with the rest of the rows containing players from Finland.\n\n2. Extract relevant data: We need to know how many Finnish players were drafted before Riihijarvi and whether there are any more Finnish players after him in the table. To do this, we'll create a variable for Riihijarvi's row index (since he is listed first in the Finland section, let's assume his row_index = 147).\n\n3. Iterate through the rows: Loop through each row of the table to check if there are any more Finnish players after Riihijarvi. Start by setting a counter to keep track of how many Finnish players have been drafted before him (let's call this `finnish_count`).\n\n4. Compare cell values: For each row, check the 'Country' column (column name = 'td.country') to see if it contains Finland (i.e., 'Finland'). If it does, increment the `finnish_count`. At the end of the loop, compare the `finnish_count` with the total number of rows in the table to determine if Riihijarvi was the last Finnish player drafted.\n\n5.
