For each row, check if the score column has a value that indicates Carsten Jancker scored a goal. A score of 3 for a single player is not shown in the table, so we can't confirm that he scored exactly 3 goals at this venue. However, there are matches where he did score, and that answers our claim partially.\n\n   - Row 2 (6th June 2000): Score: 6-2, which suggests Carsten Jancker might have scored one of the goals for his team since the total is an even number, but we don't know how many he specifically scored without further information.\n\n   - Row 7 (7th June 2000): Score: 8-2, again suggesting Carsten Jancker might have scored one of the goals, but we can't confirm this without knowing which player scored which goal in this match.\n\n   - Row 9 (9th May 2002): Score: 7-0, which means Carsten Jancker did score a goal in this match since his team won with an odd number of goals.\n\n3. Since we can confirm that Carsten Jancker scored at least one goal in \"dreisamstadion, freiburg\" (from the match on 9th May 2002), our claim is partially true.
