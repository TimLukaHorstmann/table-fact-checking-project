    "resp": "Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we need to find the value for \"four aces\" in 1 credit. To do this, we look at the table and see if there's a row with the title \"four aces\".\n2. We find that the value for \"four aces\" in the 1 credit column is indeed 160.\n3. Next, we compare this value to the claim: \"four ace yield 900 for 5 credit\", and its derived value \"the result for 1 credit would be 160\".\n4. Since the obtained value from the table matches the claim, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find the value for 'four aces' in 1 credit by looking at the corresponding row and column\", \"Compare this value to the derived value from the claim (4 aces yield 900 for 5 credits => result for 1 credit would be 160)\", \"Check if both values match\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"1 credit\"}]\n}",
