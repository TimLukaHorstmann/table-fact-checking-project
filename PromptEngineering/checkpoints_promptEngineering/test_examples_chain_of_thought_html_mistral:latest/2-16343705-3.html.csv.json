Next, I compared the \"date\" column values for these two rows to determine if they are from the same year. In this case, the helicopter's date is on \"11 aug 1986\", and the piston-engined propeller-driven aircraft's date is on \"21 aug 1989\".\n\n3. Since the dates do not match (different years), I concluded that the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, here's my final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows related to helicopter and piston-engined propeller-driven aircraft.\",\n    \"Compare their corresponding 'date' column values to determine if they are from the same year.\",\n    \"Helicopter's date: 11 aug 1986, Piston-engined's date: 21 aug 1989. Dates are different years.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\" }\n  ]\n}",
