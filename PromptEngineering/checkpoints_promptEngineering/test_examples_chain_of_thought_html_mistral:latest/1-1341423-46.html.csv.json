    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is true or false:\n\n1. Identify the district whose incumbent was elected in 1982. The table provides the 'first elected' year for each incumbent, and we can see that Norman Sisisky was first elected in 1982.\n\n2. Verify if this same individual was re-elected in subsequent years after his initial election. In the table, we can see that there are multiple rows for district Virginia 4, each with the incumbent as Norman Sisisky and 'first elected' year as 1982. One of these rows also has 'results' as \"re - elected\".\n\n3. Since one of the rows for district Virginia 4 satisfies both conditions (incumbent is Norman Sisisky and results are \"re - elected\"), it can be inferred that he was re-elected.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the district whose incumbent was elected in 1982\", \"Verify if this same individual was re-elected after his initial election\", \"Check for rows that meet both conditions (incumbent is Norman Sisisky and results are 're - elected')\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"results\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"incumbent\" }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "1. Start by analyzing the question: The claim states that \"norman sisisky be re-elected after 1982\".\n\n2. Identify the relevant table data for Norman Sisisky: Find the row where the district column value is \"virginia 4\" since we know Norman Sisisky represents this district.\n\n3. Extract the relevant information from the identified row: We see that the incumbent in this row is \"norman sisisky\", which confirms it's our target person. Also, find out when he was first elected (1982) and whether he was re-elected or not (\"re - elected\" in the results column).\n\n4. Compare the extracted information with the given claim: The extracted data matches the claim since Norman Sisisky was indeed re-elected after 1982, as evidenced by \"re - elected\" in the results column and the fact that he was first elected in 1982.\n\n5.
