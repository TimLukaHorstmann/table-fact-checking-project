Next, search the table provided to find if there is any entry related to this feature.\n3. Look for rows where the column name is \"Virtualization support for agent presence\" since it seems closely related to the AMT network interface configuration.\n4. If we find that the version 3.0 has support for virtualization, then it can be inferred that some level of network interface configuration might be possible, including VLAN settings. However, since there is no direct entry for the specific feature, it's not definitive.\n5. To provide a more accurate answer, we would need to find explicit entries about VLAN settings or Intel AMT network interfaces in version 3.0 of AMT.\n6. If we cannot find any such entries, we can say that without concrete evidence, the claim cannot be confirmed as true.\n\nanswer: \"UNKNOWN\"\nrelevant_cells:\n[\n  { \"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Virtualization support for agent presence\" }\n]",

Determine if there is a row in the table indicating that a computer has the feature of VLAN setting for Intel AMT network interface and also has AMT 3.0.\n3. If such a row does not exist, it implies that having the feature of VLAN setting for Intel AMT network interface does not necessarily mean the computer does not have AMT 3.0 since there is no evidence in the table to support this claim.\n4. However, since the table is exhaustive and provides all features for each version of AMT, if a computer has VLAN settings, it must be running an earlier version of AMT (before 3.0).\n\nanswer: FALSE\nrelevant_cells: [{\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"AMT 3.0\"}, {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"VLAN setting for Intel AMT network interface\"}]",
