Instead, we focus on the \"result\" column to determine whether a game was won or lost by the home team (implied to be the Bills in this context). If the result is in the format \"w X - Y\", then it indicates a win with a score of X-Y. If the result is in the format \"l X - Y\", then it indicates a loss with a score of X-Y.\n4.
