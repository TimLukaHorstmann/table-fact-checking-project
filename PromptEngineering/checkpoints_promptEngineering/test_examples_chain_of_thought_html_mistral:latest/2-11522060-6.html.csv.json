We don't have explicit information about Karin Knapp, but based on the claim that she was only a runner-up from 31 July 2006 to 11 October 2010, we can infer that her matches during this period should be marked as 'runner-up'.\n\n2. We look for rows where the 'Outcome' (column_name: 'outcome') is 'Runner-up' and the 'Date' (column_name: 'date') falls between 31 July 2006 and 11 October 2010.\n\n3. We find three rows that meet these criteria, with row_indices 5, 9, and 12. These are the matches of Karin Knapp during the given period:\n   - Row 5: '31 Jul 2006', Outcome: Runner-up\n   - Row 9: '11 Oct 2010', Outcome: Runner-up\n\n4.
