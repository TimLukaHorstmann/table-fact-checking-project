This will give us the total number of nominations for Brandi Love in 2013, excluding any awards that she may have won.\n\n2. Then, check the row(s) where the year column equals 2013 and the result column equals 'won'. If there is a row like this, it means Brandi Love won an award in 2013, which would not be counted in step 1. Since there are no rows with 'won' as the result, we can conclude that all nominations for Brandi Love in 2013 were 'nominated'.\n\n3. Count the number of rows where the year column equals 2013 and the result column equals 'nominated'. In this table, there are 4 such rows. However, since one of these rows represents a category where she won (Nightmoves award - best cougar / milf performer), it should not be counted twice. So, we count the number of unique awards for which she was nominated in 2013. In this case, there are three unique awards: AVN award - most outrageous sex scene, Nightmoves award - best ass, and XBIZ award - web star of the year.\n\n4. Compare the count from step 3 with the total number of awards she was nominated for in 2013.
