The claim states that the player attended every major grand slam from 2006 to 2012 except the 2006 Australian Open.\n\n2. Next, we examine the table to find out where the information about the tournaments is located. The first row contains the tournament names and the following rows contain the results for each year.\n\n3. We then look for the rows that correspond to the major grand slam tournaments (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open) from 2006 to 2012. Since we know the player attended every major grand slam tournament except the 2006 Australian Open, we focus on the '2006' column for the Australian Open row.\n\n4. We find that the Australian Open row in the '2006' column shows \"grand slam tournaments\" instead of a specific result (e.g., \"a\", \"1r\", etc.). This indicates that the player did not attend the 2006 Australian Open, which matches the claim.\n\n5. We also check other major grand slam tournaments from 2006 to 2012 for the player and find that they did indeed attend those events (the '2006' column shows \"grand slam tournaments\" for the other grand slam tournaments as well, but we know this means they attended the tournament because it was listed in the first row).\n\nSince the player attended every major grand slam from 2006 to 2012 except the 2006 Australian Open, our answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Understand claim\", \"Locate relevant information in table\", \"Check '2006' column for Australian Open row\", \"Find that the player did not attend the 2006 Australian Open\", \"Confirm attendance at other major grand slam tournaments from 2006 to 2012\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2006\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2006\"}]\n}",

Next, check if there are any instances where the tournament column has a result beyond the group stage for any year. In this table, only the \"australian open\" and \"us open\" have results beyond the group stage (quarterfinals or better).\n\n3. However, since we don't know which player is participating in these tournaments, we can't definitively say whether they progressed past the group stage or not. We would need more information to confirm this claim. In this case, let's assume for argument's sake that the player in question is the one participating in the grand slam tournaments.\n\n4. If our assumption about the player is correct, then we can see that they didn't progress past the group stage in any of the grand slam tournaments, except for the \"australian open\" and \"us open\".

In our analysis, we found that uhlirova reached the semifinal only once at the US Open, which is the tournament where she goes out most frequently at this stage.\n\n4. Check whether uhlirova's overall Grand Slam record suggests a tendency to reach the semifinals more often than other rounds. To do this, we need to compare the number of times uhlirova reached the semifinal (1) with the number of times she reached other advanced rounds like quarterfinals (qf, 0), fourth round (3r, 2), third round (2r, 4), second round (2r, 6), and first round (1r, 8).
