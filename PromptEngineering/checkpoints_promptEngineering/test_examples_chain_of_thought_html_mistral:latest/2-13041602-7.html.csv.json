    "resp": "1. Examine the table to determine if any team scored no points in a game during the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season.\n\n2. Scan through the \"Team\" column to identify the teams in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season. From the data, it appears that the teams are not explicitly listed as the Milwaukee Brewers, but we can infer this from context and by looking at the teams playing against them in each game.\n\n3. Check each row to see if a team scored 0 points in a game. In order for a team to score \"no points,\" they would need to have had a game where their total runs were 0.\n\n4. Perform the scan for scores of 0 points (total runs). There are several games where both teams scored no runs, but these cases do not necessarily mean that one team scored 0 points since the table is showing the total score for both teams in each game. Therefore, we need to find instances where only one team had a score of 0.\n\n5. Upon closer inspection, it can be seen that in the table, there are several games (26 in total) where one team scored no runs. However, these games also have instances where both teams scored no runs because the \"Team\" column indicates that they were playing against each other. In this table, a game row with two identical teams' names (for example, Cardinals vs Cardinals) shows two games between the same teams on different days.\n\n6. We need to determine if there are any instances where only one team scored no runs and not both teams scored 0. To do this, we need to look for cases where:\n    - One team's name appears twice in a row (indicating two games between the same teams on different days) but their opponent's name is different in the first and second game. This would imply that in one of those games, only one team scored 0 runs.\n    - There is a game where one team has a row with no opponent listed (an empty cell under the \"Team\" column), but their opponent can be inferred by looking at adjacent rows. In this case, if the opponent's name appears twice in subsequent or previous rows, it would imply that in the game without an explicit opponent listed, only one team scored 0 runs.\n\n7. After careful examination of the table, it can be seen that:\n    - There are no instances where a team has a double appearance with different opponents, implying that both teams scored no runs in those games.\n    - In rows 26, 27, and 28, the Reds have an opponent listed as empty in row 26 but can be inferred to play against Capuano (row 27) and Milton (row 28). Since Capuano and Milton each appear twice in the table, we can infer that they were playing on separate days, meaning that the Reds played one game where only they scored 0 runs.\n\n8. Based on our analysis, it can be said that there is at least one game (row 26) during the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season where one team scored no points.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Examine the table to identify the teams in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season.\",\n    \"Check each row to see if a team scored 0 points in a game.\",\n    \"Find instances where only one team scored 0 runs, not both.\",\n    \"Look for games where the same team appears twice but their opponent is different.\"\n    \"Examine cases where one team has no opponent listed and infer their opponent based on adjacent rows.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"Team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"Team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"Team\" }\n  ]\n}",
