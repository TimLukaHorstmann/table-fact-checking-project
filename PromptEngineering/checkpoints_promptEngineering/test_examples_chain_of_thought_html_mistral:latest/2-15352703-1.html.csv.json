Find the relevant data in the table: We need to find the row(s) where the 'pick' column equals 155 and the 'college' column has a value of \"Arizona\".\n3. Check each row against the claim condition: If we find any row(s) where both conditions (pick=155 AND college=\"Arizona\") are true, then the claim is true. Otherwise, the claim is false.\n4. Apply this logic to the table: We will loop through each row in the table and check if the conditions hold true.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Find relevant data in the table\", \"Check each row against the claim condition\", \"Apply this logic to the table\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"college\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "1. Identify the column in the table that represents the college names for each player. In this case, it's the fifth column, labeled \"college\".\n2. Compare the draft picks (rows) one by one to find out which college appears last in the draft order. To do this, we need to sort the picks in ascending order and look at the bottommost row.\n3. Sort the table rows based on the 'round' column in ascending order:\n\n```\n[\n  [\"1\", \"pick\", \"player\", \"position\", \"college\"],\n  [\"2\", \"43\", \"carwell gardner\", \"running back\", \"louisville\"],\n  [\"3\", \"70\", \"glenn parker\", \"guard\", \"arizona\"],\n  [\"4\", \"101\", \"eddie fuller\", \"running back\", \"lsu\"],\n  [\"6\", \"155\", \"john nies\", \"punter\", \"arizona\"],\n  [\"7\", \"167\", \"brent griffith\", \"guard\", \"minnesota - duluth\"],\n  [\"7\", \"171\", \"brent collins\", \"linebacker\", \"carson - newman\"],\n  [\"7\", \"182\", \"fred deriggi\", \"nose tackle\", \"syracuse\"],\n  [\"8\", \"209\", \"marvcus patton\", \"middle linebacker\", \"ucla\"],\n  [\"9\", \"239\", \"clarkston hines\", \"wide receiver\", \"duke\"],\n  [\"10\", \"266\", \"mike lodish\", \"defensive tackle\", \"ucla\"]\n]\n```\n4. Now find the bottommost row (10th row) in the sorted list: [\"10\", \"266\", \"mike lodish\", \"defensive tackle\", \"ucla\"]. The college for this player is \"ucla\".\n5. Compare if \"ucla\" appears last among all colleges. To check this, we need to go through each college in the column and see if any other college comes after \"ucla\".\n6. Look at the rest of the sorted table, starting from the second row upwards: [\"2\", \"43\", \"carwell gardner\", \"running back\", \"louisville\"], [\"3\", \"70\", \"glenn parker\", \"guard\", \"arizona\"], [\"4\", \"101\", \"eddie fuller\", \"running back\", \"lsu\"], [\"6\", \"155\", \"john nies\", \"punter\", \"arizona\"], [\"7\", \"167\", \"brent griffith\", \"guard\", \"minnesota - duluth\"], [\"7\", \"171\", \"brent collins\", \"linebacker\", \"carson - newman\"], [\"7\", \"182\", \"fred deriggi\", \"nose tackle\", \"syracuse\"], [\"8\", \"209\", \"marvcus patton\", \"middle linebacker\", \"ucla\"]. In this list, there is no college after \"ucla\".\n7.
