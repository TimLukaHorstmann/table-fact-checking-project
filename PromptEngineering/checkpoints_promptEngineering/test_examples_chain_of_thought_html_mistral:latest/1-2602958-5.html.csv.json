The claim states that Amy Sherman-Palladino directed 4 episodes in 2003. To verify this claim, we need to filter the table for episodes directed by Amy Sherman-Palladino and check if there are at least 4 episodes from 2003 among them.\n\n3. We observe that the \"Director\" column lists the name of each episode's director, and the \"Year\" column shows the air date year.\n\n4. By examining the table, we can see that Amy Sherman-Palladino directed episodes with row_index 6, 81, 83, and 85.

Since there are three episodes directed by Amy Sherman-Palladino in 2003 and one episode in 2004, the total number of episodes she directed in 2003 is 3 + 0 = 3, which is less than 4 as stated in the claim.\n\n6.
