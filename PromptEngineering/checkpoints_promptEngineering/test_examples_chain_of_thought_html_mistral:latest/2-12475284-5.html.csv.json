In this table, there are no players from any other country with a total score less than 540.\n\n3.

Compare Fred Funk's row with those having the same 'place' value (t8). To do this, find all rows where the 'place' column has a value of \"t8\" and check the 'to par' values in these rows.\n5. In the table, there are four rows with 'place' = \"t8\", and their 'to par' values are '-6', '-6', '-6', and '-6'. Since Fred Funk has the same 'to par' value as the other t8 players, he is placed in the same group.\n6.
