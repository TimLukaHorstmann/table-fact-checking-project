    "resp": "Here is my reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we will check the date of the games to see if there is a game on April 22nd. The table shows that there are five games, and their dates are in the \"date\" column. We can see that one of these games has an entry of \"april 22\".\n\n2. Next, we will check who the opponents were for each game to verify if it was New Orleans. The team column indicates the teams for each game. We can see that one of these teams is \"new orleans\". Since New Orleans is the opponent in one of the games, it's possible that this could be the correct match on April 22nd.\n\n3. Now, we will check the scores to verify if the Los Angeles Lakers won with a score of 100-86. The \"score\" column shows the result of each game. We can see that one of these entries is \"w 100 - 86\", which indicates a win by the Los Angeles Lakers. However, it's important to note that this doesn't necessarily mean it was the game on April 22nd because we only know there was a game with New Orleans on that date and we haven't identified which one yet.\n\n4. To identify the specific game on April 22nd, we will check for any additional information such as the location attendance or series number to see if they match other entries. The \"location attendance\" and \"series\" columns provide supplementary details about each game. We can compare these values with the other games to find a match.\n\n5. After comparing the remaining columns, we will determine that there is only one game on April 22nd with Los Angeles Lakers as the home team (as indicated by \"staples center\" in the location attendance column), and it's the third row of the table. The series number for this game is also '2 - 1', but since we're only interested in confirming the date, opponent, and score for April 22nd, we won't factor that in our final conclusion.\n\nNow, let me present my answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify if there is a game on April 22nd by checking the 'date' column.\",\n    \"Confirm if New Orleans was one of the teams involved by checking the 'team' column.\",\n    \"Check if Los Angeles Lakers won with the score 100-86 by examining the 'score' column.\",\n    \"Identify the specific game on April 22nd by comparing supplementary details such as location attendance and series.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}",

Compare the team names mentioned in the `game` column with the known teams that played during the 2010-11 season (Los Angeles Lakers and New Orleans).\n3. The table shows a series of matches between two teams named \"new orleans\" and \"lakers\". While Los Angeles Lakers are commonly known, the name \"new orleans\" may refer to the team now known as the \"New Orleans Pelicans\", which was previously called the \"New Orleans Hornets\" during the 2010-11 season.\n4. To verify this assumption, check historical records for professional basketball teams based in New Orleans during that season. If the team is found to be the New Orleans Hornets (now Pelicans), then the matches can be considered games between Los Angeles Lakers and New Orleans during the 2010-11 season.\n5.
