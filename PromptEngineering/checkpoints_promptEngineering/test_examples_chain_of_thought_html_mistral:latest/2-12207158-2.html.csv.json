By examining the table, it can be seen that the Yankees (row index: 13) do not have their next game listed in the table, so they are no longer relevant to this claim.\n5. The remaining four teams will play against other teams in their subsequent games. However, none of these teams will be facing the Yankees as their opponent when they were at a record of 4-5.\n6. Therefore, the opponent cannot be the Yankee when the record is 4-5.\n\nanswer: \"FALSE\"\nrelevant_cells: [\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 13,\n    \"column_name\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 26,\n    \"column_name\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 47,\n    \"column_name\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 59,\n    \"column_name\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 71,\n    \"column_name\": \"\"\n  }\n]",
