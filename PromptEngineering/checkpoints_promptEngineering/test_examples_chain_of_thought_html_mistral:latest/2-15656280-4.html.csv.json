Identify the criteria given in the claim: the highest number of goals scored in play-offs among players who have scored 2 goals in the FA cup.\n2. Locate the relevant columns in the table that correspond to the given criteria: 'play - offs' and 'fa cup'. This will help us filter out the required data.\n3. Iterate through each row of the table and check if a player has scored 2 goals in the FA Cup (the 'fa cup' column).\n4. For any player who meets the first condition, compare their total play-off goals with other players that also meet the same condition to find the highest number.\n5. If no player meets the given criteria of having scored 2 goals in the FA Cup and having played in the play-offs, then there is no such case, and the claim would be false.\n6. Output the final answer as a JSON object with clear explanations for each step.\n\n   Here's the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the criteria given in the claim\", \"Locate the relevant columns for the given criteria\", \"Iterate through each row to find players who meet the condition\", \"Compare their play-off goals to find the highest score among those players\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"play - offs\"}\n    // other relevant cells as needed if the highest score is found in another row\n  ]\n}",
