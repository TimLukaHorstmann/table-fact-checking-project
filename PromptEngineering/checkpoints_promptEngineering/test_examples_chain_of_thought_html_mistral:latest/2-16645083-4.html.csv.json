    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we will examine each row in the table to find any instances where both the 'bask' score and 'indoor track' score are 0 and the 'swim' score is 5.\n2. We start with the first school, Cleveland State, which has a bask score of 2 (not 0), an indoor track score of '-', and no swim score. Therefore, it does not meet the condition.\n3. The next school, Detroit, has a bask score of 3 (not 0) and no swim score. Again, it does not meet the condition.\n4. Green Bay's bask score is 28 (not 0), its indoor track score is '-', and it has only one swim score, which is 9 (not 5). So, it also does not meet the condition.\n5. Milwaukee has a bask score of 4 (not 0), an indoor track score of 9 (not 0), no swim score, so it doesn't meet the condition either.\n6. UIC has a bask score of 0 (correct), an indoor track score of 0 (correct), and a swim score of 18 (not 5). So, UIC does not meet the condition.\n7. Valparaiso has a bask score of 0 (correct), an indoor track score of 0 (correct), and no swim score. Therefore, it doesn't meet the condition.\n8. Wright State has a bask score of 0 (correct), an indoor track score is unknown since it's '-', and it has only four swim scores, none of which are 5. So, Wright State does not meet the condition.\n9. Youngstown State has a bask score of 0 (correct), an indoor track score of 3 (not 0), and one swim score of 1 (not 5). Therefore, it doesn't meet the condition.\n\nSince none of the schools in the table meet the specified conditions (bask score = 0, indoor track score = 0, swim score = 5), the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the final JSON object:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Check if each school has a bask score of 0 and an indoor track score of 0 while also having a swim score of 5.\\n2. Examine each row in the table to find any instances that meet these conditions.\\n3.

Locate the row in the table that corresponds to \"Green Bay\" (row index 2).\n3. Check the values of the columns \"swimming\" and \"volleyball\", as specified in the claim, for the \"Green Bay\" row. In this case, we find values 9 and 1 respectively.\n4. Check if the total score is more than 35. To do this, locate the \"total\" column and check its value for the \"Green Bay\" row (column name: 'total', row index: 2). In this case, the value is 40.\n5. Compare the values obtained in steps 3 and 4 with the claim: Swim score of 9, Volleyball score of 1, Total score more than 35.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, here's the final answer as a JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify school for which we need to check scores\",\n    \"Locate row in table corresponding to specified school\",\n    \"Check values of 'swimming', 'volleyball' columns for the located row\",\n    \"Check if total score is more than 35 (locate and compare with value in 'total' column)\",\n    \"Compare obtained values with claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"swimming\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"volleyball\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
