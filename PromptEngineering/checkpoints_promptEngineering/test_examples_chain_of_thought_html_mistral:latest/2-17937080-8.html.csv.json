Determine the goal per match for this player. To find the goal per match, we divide the total goals by the number of matches played. In this case, Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano's total goals are 43 and his apps (appearances) are 43. So, Goal per match = Total Goals / Apps = 43 / 43 = 1.000.\n3. Compare the calculated goal per match with the given value of 1.237. In this case, 1.000 (Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano's goal per match) is less than 1.237.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the player on rank 11\", \"Determine the goal per match for this player\", \"Compare the calculated goal per match with the given value of 1.237\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Goal per match\"}]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the goal per match (goals/apps) column, as it contains the relevant data for comparing the goal efficiency of each player.\n2. Look through the table to find players who have a higher goal per match than 1.237 (the value in question).\n3. Check the rows where Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo appear multiple times, as they are the two most likely to have high goal efficiency due to their consistent performances over the years.\n4. Compare the goal per match for each of these players to 1.237:\n   - For Lionel Messi, in row 1 (Telmo Zarra has a lower goal per match), the goal per match is 1.278 (relevant_cells: [{row_index: 1, column_name: 'goals/apps'}]) which is higher than 1.237, so we don't need to consider any other rows for Lionel Messi.\n   - For Cristiano Ronaldo, in row 6 (Mariano Mart\u00edn has a lower goal per match), the goal per match is 1.355 (relevant_cells: [{row_index: 6, column_name: 'goals/apps'}]) which is higher than 1.237, so we don't need to consider any other rows for Cristiano Ronaldo either.\n5. Since neither Lionel Messi nor Cristiano Ronaldo appear with a rank of 11 or lower, the claim that \"11.0 be the rank that have goal per match more than 1.237\" is FALSE.\n\n   Here's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the 'goals/apps' column\",\n    \"Look for players with a higher goal per match than 1.237\",\n    \"Check rows of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo\",\n    \"Compare their goals/apps to 1.237\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": 'goals/apps' },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": 'goals/apps' }\n  ]\n}",

In this case, the player is \"lionel messi\" and the season is \"2011 / 12\".\n\n2. Next, iterate through each row of the table to find the row that matches our search criteria. We will look at the 'name' column for Messi and the 'season' column for the specific year.\n\n3. After finding a match, verify that the rank is 2.
