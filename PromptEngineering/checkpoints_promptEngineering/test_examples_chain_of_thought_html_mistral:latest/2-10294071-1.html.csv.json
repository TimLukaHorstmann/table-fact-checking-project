    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Identify the player for whom we need to check the debut year and number of ties played. The player is Dragutin Miti\u0107.\n2. Locate the row in the table that corresponds to Dragutin Miti\u0107. In this case, it's the fourth row with index 3.\n3. Extract the columns of interest: 'debut' (column_name: 'debut') and 'ties played' (column_name: 'ties played'). For Dragutin Miti\u0107, we find \"1936\" in the 'debut' column and \"29\" in the 'ties played' column.\n4. Compare the year and number of ties played found in step 3 with the claim that Dragutin Miti\u0107 has a debut year of 1936 and 29.0 ties played.\n5.
