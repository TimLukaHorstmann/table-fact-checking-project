However, since there are 5 rows and only 30 days in April, there must be some repetition of dates (as games could span more than one day).

We can see that Dell Curry did not score the highest points on any of the games except for May 2 (as per the claim). However, it's important to note that even though he didn't have the highest points in other games, the claim specifically asks if he \"lead\" the Raptors in both points and rebounds.\n\n3. Verify if Dell Curry had more rebounds than what is shown in the 'high rebounds' column for any of the games: We can check the 'high rebounds' column to see who had the highest number of rebounds for the Raptors on each game date. We can see that on May 2, Dell Curry was not listed as having the highest number of rebounds. The claim asks if he led in both points and rebounds, so even though we found out that he had the most points, we still need to confirm that he didn't have the most rebounds for the Raptors on May 2.\n\n4. Examine if there are any situations where a player scored more points but did not lead in points and/or rebounds: We can check the 'score' and 'high points' columns to see who scored the most points for the Raptors on each game date, but we also need to verify that those players had higher numbers of rebounds as well. We can see that on some games, different players had more points than Dell Curry, but they didn't have the highest number of rebounds either (e.g., Morris Peterson and Chris Childs).\n\n5. Conclude if Dell Curry led the Raptors in both points and rebounds on May 2: Based on our analysis, we can see that on May 2, Dell Curry did have the most points for the Raptors (17) but he didn't have the highest number of rebounds for the Raptors (Antonio Davis had 12).
