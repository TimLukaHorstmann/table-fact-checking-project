In this case, the relevant row is the first one with a rank of 1.\n2. Check the \"notes\" column for the identified row to determine if it matches the claim's note value (fa). In this case, the notes value in the first row is fa.\n3. Compare the country of the identified rower from step 1 with the country specified in the claim (new zealand). In this case, both are consistent because new zealand is the value in the second column of the first row.\n4.
