To find out what percentage of these registered voters are \"other\", we need to find the corresponding cell in the table for \"Other\" and \"palm desert\". This cell is not explicitly shown in the table provided, but since it represents a part of the total 100%, we can infer that it should be subtracted from the total percentage given (50.7%).\n4. Since no explicit value for \"other\" registered voters is given in the table, and the claim specifies only registered voters from Palm Desert, we cannot determine the exact percentage of other registered voters in Palm Desert without more information or context.\n5. However, since the claim does not specify a strict equality (e.g., \"exactly 7.6%\"), but rather includes the phrase \"be\", we can interpret this as asking whether any percentage of registered voters in palm desert falls into the category of \"other\". This is true because if there are any other registered voters in Palm Desert, then the claim would be correct.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find row index for 'palm desert'\",\n    \"Determine % Registered Voters for found row\",\n    \"Find relevant cell for 'Other' and 'palm desert'\",\n    \"Subtract the Other registered voters from the total Registered Voters to find the percentage of other voters\",\n    \"Compare the calculated percentage with the claim's requirement (7.6%)\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"% Registered Voters\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"Other\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
