    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to determine which teams are from Melbourne. The table lists four teams (north melbourne, melbourne, footscray, and st kilda). We know that Melbourne is a city in Australia where the Melbourne Football Club (MFC) is located. Since the table explicitly names two teams as north melbourne and south melbourne, we can infer that north melbourne is not from Melbourne.\n\n2. Now, we have one team left to consider: st kilda. To confirm whether it's also from Melbourne, we will check if there are any other teams in the table with \"Melbourne\" as their location. If so, then at least one team other than st kilda must be from Melbourne.\n\n3. However, after inspecting the entire table, no other team is listed as being from Melbourne besides melbourne (which we already know is not the same as st kilda). So, since st kilda is the only remaining team and it's located in Melbourne, it must account for the second team from Melbourne.\n\n4. Finally, we need to check if there is one more team that can be considered part of \"1 each from north and south\". In this table, there are no teams explicitly listed as being from either north or south Melbourne. However, since there are no other teams apart from st kilda (Melbourne) and melbourne, the statement doesn't require a third team to be from either north or south Melbourne.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify teams from Melbourne by checking their location.\",\n    \"Determine which teams are not from Melbourne.\",\n    \"Check if any other teams can be inferred as being from 'north' or 'south' Melbourne.\",\n    \"Analyze the total number of teams from Melbourne and their locations to determine if the claim is true.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}",

Next, we look through each row in the table to check if either the home team score or the away team score is less than 10. We can see that the scores are represented as \"score\" in the table, and they are presented as two decimal points followed by numbers (e.g., \"10.20 (80)\" for a home team score of 80).\n\n3. We then compare each score to 10, keeping track of how many scores meet the condition. For example, in the first row, neither team's score is less than 10. In the second row, Melbourne's score is greater than 10 (120), so we move on to the next row.\n\n4. We continue this process for each row until we have checked all of them.\n\n5.

Count the number of games (rows) in the table to get an overview of all the matches.\n\n3. Compare the values in the \"crowd\" column for each game. If any two games share the same crowd size, then it means that two games have a crowd size of exactly 10000.\n\n4. Look for the row(s) where the value in the \"crowd\" column is 10000.
