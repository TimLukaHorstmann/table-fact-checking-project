Determine the air date for each episode:\n   - For \"waste - part 2\", the air date is December 13, 1971 (row_index 45, column name \"airdate\").\n   - For \"trafton\", since there's no direct mention of the airdate in the provided table, I need to find a reference to when it aired.\n4. Calculate the number of days between these two dates:\n   - Since December 13, 1971 is a Monday and trafton is listed on February 7, 1972 (row_index 60, column name \"airdate\"), we can assume that there are at least 53 days between the two air dates (as there were approximately 7 days per week in this period).\n   - However, to determine the exact number of days, we would need more specific information about which week of the month each episode aired. Since such details are not provided, it's impossible to find an exact number of days between the two air dates.\n5. Conclude that while we can confirm that there were at least 53 days between the air dates of waste - part 2 and trafton, we cannot say with certainty whether trafton aired exactly 3 weeks after waste - part 2 due to the lack of specific information about which week in December waste - part 2 aired.\n\nanswer: \"TRUE\" (since there were at least 53 days between the two air dates)\nrelevant_cells:\n[\n  { \"row_index\": 45, \"column_name\": \"airdate\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 60, \"column_name\": \"airdate\" }\n]",
