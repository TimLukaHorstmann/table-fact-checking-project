To do this, we will sort the table by the \"attendance\" column in descending order.\n\n2. Next, we will look for the corresponding date from the sorted table with the maximum attendance value. In this case, it is on 20 February, 1904.\n\n3. Since the claim is about the highest attendance of the Manchester United FC season, we need to check if all other matches in the table belong to the same season as the match with the highest attendance. The first match in the table (12 December, 1903) can help us determine the season. In football history, seasons usually start in August and end in May or June, but in this case, it's reasonable to assume that since the first match is played in December, it belongs to the same season as the remaining matches (1903-1904).\n\n   If all other matches also belong to the 1903-1904 season and no other matches have a higher attendance than the one on 20 February, 1904, then the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's check the relevant cells:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Sort the table by 'attendance' column in descending order.\",\n    \"Find the corresponding date with the maximum attendance value.\",\n    \"Check if all other matches belong to the same season as the match with the highest attendance.\",\n    \"If all other matches also belong to the 1903-1904 season and no other matches have a higher attendance than the one on 20 February, 1904, then the claim is true.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" }\n  ]\n}",
