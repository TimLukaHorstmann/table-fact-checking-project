Next, we look at the number of games lost for 'corus rfc', which is 4 (from the row corresponding to 'corus rfc' in the table).\n\n3. Then, we compare this with the number of games drawn, which is also 1 for 'corus rfc'. Since the number of games lost (4) is greater than the number of games drawn (1), it means that 'corus rfc' did indeed lose more games than they drew.\n\n4. Now, we need to determine if there exists a club with more points scored against them than 'corus rfc'. To do this, we look at the \"points against\" column for all clubs in the table. We compare the value for 'corus rfc' (572) with the values of other clubs in the same column.\n\n5. After comparing all the values, we find that there are several clubs that have a greater number of points scored against them than 'corus rfc'. For instance, 'waunarlwydd rfc' has 572 points against (same as corus) but also 8 more points from try bonus and 1 less point deducted for yellow cards. So, there are clubs with more points scored against them, hence not meeting the condition that 'corus rfc' does not have the most points scored against them.\n\n6.
