Check for exceptions: To find out if there are any exceptions (i.e., players who do not have a summer transfer window), look for players whose transfer windows are labeled as something other than 'summer'. In this table, the players with winter transfer windows are Edson Ratinho, Basinas, Zorbas, and Tofas.\n6.
