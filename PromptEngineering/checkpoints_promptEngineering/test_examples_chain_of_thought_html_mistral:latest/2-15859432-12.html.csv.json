Iterate through each row in the table (excluding the header) to compare the block and spike values with those in the table.\n3. For each row, check if either the 'block' or 'spike' value matches the target values (340 or 353 respectively). If a match is found, note down the corresponding row index.\n4.

However, since there are matching rows in this table (phillip eatherton has a weight of 94 and spike of 356, which is closer to 353, and kevin barnett has a weight of 94 and spike of 353), the claim cannot be definitively labeled as false.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the target values: 340 for block, 353 for spike\",\n    \"Iterate through each row in the table (excluding header)\",\n    \"For each row, check if either the 'block' or 'spike' value matches the target values\",\n    \"If a match is found, note down the corresponding row index\",\n    \"After checking all rows, if no matching row is found for both block and spike values, the claim is false.

Next, we go through each row in the table to check if any of them have a weight value that matches either 340 or 353.\n3. We start from the first row and check the 'weight' column for the values 340 and 353. If we find a match, we will know that the claim is false.\n4.
