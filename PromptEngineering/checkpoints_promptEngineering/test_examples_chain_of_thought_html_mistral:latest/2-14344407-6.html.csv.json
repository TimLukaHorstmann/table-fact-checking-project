Locate the game numbers in the table: The game numbers are represented by the first column of the table (indexed as \"game\").\n3. Compare the game number in the claim with the game numbers in the table: Game 63 corresponds to row index 62 in the table.\n4. Check the opponent's name for that row: The opponent's name for row 62 is located in the third column of the table (indexed as \"opponent\"). In this case, it reads \"new york islanders\".\n5. Make a conclusion based on the comparison: Since the name of the opponent for game 63, as stated in the claim, matches the name of the opponent in row 62 of the table, we can conclude that the New York Islanders were indeed the opponents in game 63.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, here is the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim and locate relevant information in the table.\",\n    \"Compare the game number from the claim with the game numbers in the table.\",\n    \"Check the opponent's name for the corresponding game number.\",\n    \"Make a conclusion based on the comparison.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 62,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

In this new row, note the record value. This will be the team's record after the game.\n5. Compare the record before and after the game to check if the claim is true or false. If the difference between the two record values has a win increased by 1 and a loss increased by 1 (as expected for a loss of 4-1), then the claim is true.
