There are two rows with this year, one in the Thomas Cup and another in the European Men's Team Championships sections.

In the relevant row (which is the 7th row), check the 'outcome' column. The value in this cell is '13'.\n\n3. Since the value '13' appears in the 'outcome' cell for the row containing the date '2007', it can be deduced that the claim \"the Glasgow game report an outcome of 13 in 2007\" is TRUE.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Look for a row containing the year '2007'.
