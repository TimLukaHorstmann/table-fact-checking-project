Since week numbers start from 1, week 8 would be the 8th row in the table.\n\n2. Check the cell in this row with column name \"attendance\". This cell contains the attendance number for week 8.\n\n3. Compare the value of the attendance cell (which is located at the 8th row and \"attendance\" column) to the claim value of 61603.\n\nNow, let's put the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the row for week 8.

Determine the row index that corresponds to the Dallas Cowboys match by searching through each row of the table until we find a matching opponent (Dallas Cowboys).\n3. Once we have found the row index, identify the corresponding value in the attendance column for that row. This value will give us the number of attendees at the game versus the Dallas Cowboys.\n4.

Identify the claim's conditions: The attendance should be 62170, the opponent should be Dallas Cowboys, and the week number is not specified but we can assume it is relevant as well.\n\n2. Locate the row in the table that matches the given condition (opponent=Dallas Cowboys and attendance=62170). This will help us find the corresponding week number.\n\n3. Iterate through each row in the table, compare the opponent and attendance values with the given conditions. In case a match is found, we can get the week number from that row.\n\n4. If there's no match, then the claim is FALSE, as there's no record of the Dallas Cowboys having an attendance of 62170 in this table.\n\n5. If a match is found, check if the week number corresponds to the 10th week (as per our assumption) or any other week number.
