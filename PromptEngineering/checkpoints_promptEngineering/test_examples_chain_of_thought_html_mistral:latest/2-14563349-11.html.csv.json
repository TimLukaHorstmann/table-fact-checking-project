The game happened on nov 26, so we can find the corresponding row by looking for the date \"sun nov 12\".

I will go through each row in the table and compare the result and time columns.\n\n3. Upon examining the rows, I find that the combination \"w 34 - 14\" and \"1:00 pm\" can be found only in row 12 (week 12), where the Miami Dolphins played against the Pittsburgh Steelers. The relevant cells are as follows:\n   - Relevant cells: [{\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}, {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Time\"}]\n\n4.
