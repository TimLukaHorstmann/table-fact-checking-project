Identify the season for which we need to check the average attendance: The claim mentions the \"4th western, 5 - 10\" season.\n\n2. Locate the row in the table that corresponds to this specific season. In this table, there are no rows with \"4th western, 5 - 10\". However, we can find the closest match which is the \"4th western, 5 - 10\" season's predecessor, which is \"2009 - 2010\".\n\n3. Extract the average attendance for the identified season: In the row corresponding to \"2009 - 2010\", the value for 'avg attendance' is 942.\n\nNow, let's create the JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the season in question (4th western, 5 - 10),\" \"Locate the closest match in the table (2009-2010),\" \"Extract the average attendance for this season (942)\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"avg attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, identify the rows in the table that correspond to the given league names (misl ii and pasl - pro) as they are the ones mentioned in the claim.

Next, check the \"avg attendance\" column of these identified rows to determine if their average is 2358 or higher.
