The table provides us with multiple rows of data, one per year. We will iterate through these years and compare each team's points at that particular year with the claimed value.\n2. Start from the first row (which corresponds to the year 1979). Compare the team's points in this year with the claimed value of 190. The team \"hb - honda\" doesn't have any data for 1979, so we move on to the next year.\n3. Repeat step 2 for each subsequent row (corresponding to the years 1980, 1982, 1983, ..., 1990) until we reach the row with the year 1989. In this row, the team \"hb - honda\" has 190 points.\n4.
