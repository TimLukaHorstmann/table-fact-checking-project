Check if 'top - 25' is less than 4 for the given tournament: From the table, we see that for the 'pga championship', 'top - 25' is 4. Since 4 > 4 (the required value), the condition is not met.\n3. Check if 'wins' is 0 for the given tournament when the condition on 'top - 25' is not met: Since we have already seen that the condition on 'top - 25' is not met, we can move to the next step without checking whether 'wins' is 0.\n4. Check if 'top - 5' is greater than 0 for the given tournament: From the table, we see that for the 'pga championship', 'top - 5' is 1. Since 1 > 0 (the required value), the condition is met.\n5. Check if 'cuts made' is 6 for the given tournament when the condition on 'top - 25' is not met: From the table, we see that for the 'pga championship', 'cuts made' is 8.
