    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to compare the crowd numbers for each game listed in the table on 26 August 1967. We can see that there are six games played on this date, as indicated by the \"date\" column.\n\n2. Next, we should check if any of the crowds for these games exceeds the crowd number at Kardinya Park (34616). In our table, we find that this is indeed the lowest crowd number among all the games played on 26 August 1967.\n\n3. Since we have not found a higher crowd number among the games played on 26 August 1967, it suggests that Kardinya Park may have recorded the highest number of crowd participation during this particular day. However, to definitively answer the question, we would need to compare the crowd numbers for all games played across the entire 1967 VFL season.\n\n4. Without additional information about other games played during the 1967 VFL season, we cannot conclusively say that Kardinya Park had the highest crowd participation for the entire season.
