Compare the extracted year with the requirement of being elevated earlier than 1116: To do this, we need to convert 'circa 1116' into an exact date for comparison purposes. A reasonable assumption would be to consider 'circa 1116' as either equal to or before 1115 (the year just prior to 1116).\n\n5.
