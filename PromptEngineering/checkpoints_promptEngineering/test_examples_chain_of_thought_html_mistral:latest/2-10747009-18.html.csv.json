The home team column contains the names of the teams playing at home, while the away team column contains the names of the teams playing away.\n2. Search for the row where the home team's name is \"carlton\". This is the third row in the table.\n3. Check the away team's name in the same row to see if it matches with \"st kilda\". In this case, it does not match.\n4. If a home team plays at its own ground (which they usually do), their name should appear in the \"home team\" column, and the opponent's name should appear in the \"away team\" column. So, if we cannot find a row where the home team is Carlton and the away team is St Kilda, it means that on September 10, 1927, there was no game at Princess Park with Carlton as the home team playing against St Kilda.\n\nThe final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the home and away team columns\",\n    \"Search for the row where the home team is 'carlton'\",\n    \"Check if the away team's name in the same row matches with 'st kilda'\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
