We need to find a team that played against Miami (since the table lists all games Miami played).\n2. Examine each row of the table and look for games where one team is listed as \"Detroit\" (implicitly assuming that the other team is Miami, since it's the team the table lists data for).\n3. Find a match in the table: Row 17 shows a game against Detroit with the score 95 - 94 (not overtime), so this row doesn't fit our criteria. Rows 18-42 don't have information about Miami playing against Detroit because they list scores of games where Miami was the home team.\n4. Go back to rows 1-16: Row 3 shows a game with the score 96 - 98, but this is not overtime and doesn't fit our criteria. Row 2 shows no information about any score because it's just headers.\n5. Examine row 1 carefully: The team listed as \"Detroit\" (column 3) and the score listed in the same row for Miami (column 4) is 97 - 72, and this is overtime (indicated by \"(ot)\" at the end of the score).\n6.
