Since the table provides the player, opponent, venue, season, and rank, we can only determine the team from the opponent column.

The table provides the rank for each match, and Rod McCurdy's rank is 1 (highest), while Paul Hutchison's rank is 3.\n\n3. Compare their ranks. To check whether one player is ranked above another within a team, we simply compare their ranks.
