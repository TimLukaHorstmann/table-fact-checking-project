Check if both players were loaned out to Alianza Atl\u00e9tico in the same year: Since we know that both players are loaned out and their transfer windows are 'winter', we now need to check if they were loaned out to Alianza Atl\u00e9tico for the same year (indicated by the \"nat\" column).\n\nNow, let's examine the relevant cells:\n\n1. For player v zapata:\n   - row_index: 1\n   - column_name: type\n   - row_index: 1\n   - column_name: transfer window\n2. For player curiel:\n   - row_index: 5\n   - column_name: type\n   - row_index: 5\n   - column_name: transfer window\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1) Identify the players in question (v zapata and curiel). 2) Determine if they have been loaned out by checking their type (loaned out). 3) Find the transfer window for each player. 4) Compare the transfer window and loan status of both players. 5) Check if both players were loaned out to Alianza Atl\u00e9tico in the same year.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"transfer window\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"transfer window\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
