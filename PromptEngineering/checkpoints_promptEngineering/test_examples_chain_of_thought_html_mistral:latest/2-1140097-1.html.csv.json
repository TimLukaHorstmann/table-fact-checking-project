For 'brabham - repco', there are three distinct wins (Jack Brabham in British GP, Dutch GP, and German GP). We verify if any other constructor has more than one win. There are no other constructors with more than one win. Therefore, 'brabham - repco' only has one win vehicle.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Identify all drivers in the table. The drivers are Jim Clark, Jack Brabham, John Surtees, Lorenzo Bandini, Mike Parkes, and Richie Ginther.\n\n2. For each driver, check if they have both the fastest lap (4th column) and won the race (6th column). This means finding rows where the driver's name is in the 5th column (winning driver) and the same driver's name is either in the 3rd column (fastest lap) or a row with an empty 3rd column exists.\n\n3. After checking for each driver, compare the results to see if only Jim Clark and Richie Ginther meet this condition.\n\nThe relevant cells for each driver are:\n- For Jim Clark: [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\"}]\n- For Jack Brabham: [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\"}]\n- For John Surtees: [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\"}]\n- For Lorenzo Bandini: [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\"}]\n- For Mike Parkes: [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"}]\n- For Richie Ginther: [{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"}, {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\"}]\n\nComparing the results, only Jim Clark and Richie Ginther have both the fastest lap and won the race.
