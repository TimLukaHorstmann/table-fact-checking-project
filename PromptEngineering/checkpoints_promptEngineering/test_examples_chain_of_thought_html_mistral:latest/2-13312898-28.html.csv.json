    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process to determine whether the claim is true or false:\n\n1. First, we identify the round for which the player(s) are selected according to the given claim. In this case, it is the 2nd round since the claim states \"2 players be pick during the 2nd round of the draft\".\n\n2. Then, we look at each row in the table to find players that were picked during the 2nd round (overall = 32 + previous round picks).\n\n3. We then compare the number of rows where overall is greater than or equal to 32 with the total number of rows in the table. If the difference is 2 or more, it means there are 2 players picked during the 2nd round, and therefore the claim is true.\n\n4. To verify our findings, we look for relevant cells in the table:\n   - First player (row_index=1): overall = 5 (not relevant since it's less than 32)\n   - Second player (row_index=2): overall = 32 (relevant since it matches the required round)\n   - Third player (row_index=3): overall = 32 + previous picks = 64 (not relevant since it's greater than 32)\n   - Fourth player (row_index=4): overall = 51 (not relevant since it's less than 32)\n   - Fifth player (row_index=5): overall = 88 (not relevant since it's greater than 32)\n   - Sixth player (row_index=6): overall = 144 (not relevant since it's greater than 32)\n   - Seventh player (row_index=7): overall = 170 (not relevant since it's greater than 32)\n   - Eighth player (row_index=8): overall = 195 (not relevant since it's greater than 32)\n   - Ninth player (row_index=9): overall = 227 (not relevant since it's greater than 32)\n   - Tenth player (row_index=10): overall = 254 (not relevant since it's greater than 32)\n   - Eleventh player (row_index=11): overall = 280 (not relevant since it's greater than 32)\n   - Twelfth player (row_index=12, row_index=12): overall = 311 and 324 (relevant rows since they are both greater than or equal to 32)\n\n5.

Next, determine the highest round number for each of these running backs. In this case, it's important to note that only Curtis Dickey and Mark Bright have a 'round' value specified, while Chris Foote does not. Since there is no rule that dictates a player without a round value must be picked after the 10th round, we will consider both Curtis Dickey (picked in round 1) and Mark Bright (picked in round 9).\n\n3. Compare this highest round number to the specified 10th round.
