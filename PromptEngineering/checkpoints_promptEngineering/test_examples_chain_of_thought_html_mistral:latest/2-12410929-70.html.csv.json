Extract the dates from the table: The given dates are in the format \"dd , dd , dd , dd , dd MM yy\", where MM yy represents the month and year. In this case, we can see that the dates for the matches are: 25, 26, 27, 28 January 1997 and 1, 2, 3 February 1997.\n\n4. Identify the venue for each match: The venues for the matches in our table are Brisbane Cricket Ground, Sydney Cricket Ground, Melbourne Cricket Ground, Adelaide Oval, and WACA Ground. We will focus on the row where the date matches January 1997 (rows 2,3,4).\n\n5. Compare the extracted data with the claim: If all the matches in January have \"Adelaide Oval\" as their venue, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false. In this case, one of the matches in January took place at Adelaide Oval, and two did not (one each for Melbourne Cricket Ground and WACA Ground).

The fourth and fifth matches are in January and February respectively.\n\n2. Since the first two matches span across two calendar months (November and December) while the other three matches are in different months (January and February), it implies that the matches in November and December are not within the same venue because they belong to different months.\n\n3. To support this conclusion, check if there is a change in the venue between these two sets of matches. In the table, the first two matches took place at Brisbane Cricket Ground (BCG), Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) and again BCG while the third match was at Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).
