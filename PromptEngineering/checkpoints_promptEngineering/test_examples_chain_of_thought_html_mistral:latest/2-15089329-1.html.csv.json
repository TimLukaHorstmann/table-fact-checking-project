Next, sort the table by the \"dcsf number\" column in ascending order to make it easier to compare values.\n\n3.

In this table, the rows with index 5 (nash mills), 6 (leverstock green), 8 (st albert the great), and 10 (tudor) have DCSF numbers greater than 3000.\n\n4. Count the number of schools that have a DCSF number greater than 3000. There are 4 such schools, which matches the first condition in the claim.\n\n5. Now, look for a school with a DCSF number greater than 7000. In this table, there is no such school, as all DCSF numbers are below 7000.\n\n6.
