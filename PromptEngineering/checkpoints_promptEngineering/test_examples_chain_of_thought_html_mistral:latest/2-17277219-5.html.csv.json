    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim is that Don Whitt finishes in a tie for ninth place.\n\n2. Locate Don Whitt's row in the table based on the player column. In this case, his row index is 10 (counting from 0).\n\n3. Compare Don Whitt's score with other players' scores to see if they are tied. To do this, look for rows where the place and player columns match Don Whitt's row and the score column has the same value or a value that is one more than Don Whitt's score.\n\n4. In our table, there are two rows (10th and 11th) with the same score as Don Whitt (144). Since they also share the same place value \"t9\", it means that Don Whitt finishes in a tie for ninth place.\n\nNow let's format the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim and locate the relevant player (Don Whitt) in the table\",\n    \"Compare Don Whitt's score with other players' scores to see if they are tied\",\n    \"Check for rows where place, player, and score columns match or have values close to Don Whitt's\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"place\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"to par\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the table structure. Each row represents a player, their place (relative to other players), their name, country, score, and their position relative to par.\n\n2. The claim states that \"the place gene littler finish in be t9\". In this context, it means we are looking for whether Gene Littler's final place is tied with the 9th placed player.\n\n3. To find out Gene Littler's position, we need to look for his score and compare it with other players'. In this table, Gene Littler's score is in the row with \"player\": \"gene littler\" which has a score of 143 (69 + 74).\n\n4. We then compare Gene Littler's score (143) with other players' scores:\n   - Arnold Palmer, Bob Rosburg and Billy Maxwell have scores less than 143, so they finish before Gene Littler.\n   - Bobby Nichols, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Miller Barber, and Gene Little share the same score of 143. However, since they are listed in different positions (t4, t7, t7, t9, t9 respectively), it means they finished at these tied positions before Gene Littler.\n\n5. After comparing all scores, we find that Gene Littler's score is higher than the scores of players who finished before him, but lower or equal to the scores of players who are tied with the 9th place. This indicates that Gene Littler ties for the 9th place.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Understand the table structure\",\n    \"Identify the player and their score (Gene Littler, 143)\",\n    \"Compare Gene Littler's score with other players' scores\",\n    \"Determine Gene Littler's final place based on comparison\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}",
