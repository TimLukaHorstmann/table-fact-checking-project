For example, if there were teams in 1984 and 1985 with identical car chassis and engine but different points, it could suggest a missing entry for one of those years.\n3. Inspect the table for any potential inconsistencies:\n   - No team appears to have both 'cosworth v8' and 'bmw str - 4 t / c' engines within a single year, so there doesn't seem to be an engine change that could indicate missing entries.\n   - The only identical car chassis across different teams are 'arrows' models in 1982-84, but they all have the same points (3, 0, and 1) respectively, so no inconsistency there.\n   - No team appears to have multiple entries within a single year with different points.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that no entry for Marc Surer in 1984 or 1985 exists within this dataset.

In this table, we don't have specific data about drivers, only teams. However, we can look for teams that were active during those years to narrow down our search.\n\n2. Look through the table to find any teams that were active in 1985 or 1986. The teams \"motor racing developments ltd\" (row 12) and \"barclay arrows bmw\" (rows 13 and 14) were active in 1985 and 1986 respectively.\n\n3. Check if any of these teams had points scored for Marc Surer specifically. Since we don't have individual driver data, we can only find out if a team scored points during those years. In this table, we see that \"motor racing developments ltd\" (row 12) scored 5 points in 1985 and \"barclay arrows bmw\" (row 14) did not score any points in 1986.\n\n4. Compare the given claim with our findings from step 3. The claim states that Marc Surer scored a total of 5 points in both 1985 and 1986. Since we find that \"motor racing developments ltd\" (row 12) scored 5 points in 1985, this team could potentially be associated with Marc Surer. However, no points were scored by any team in 1986 for the given data.\n\n5. Since the claim asks about scoring a total of 5 points in both 1985 and 1986, and we found that only one year (1985) had a team associated with Marc Surer who scored 5 points, the claim is not accurate.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the teams active in 1985 and/or 1986\",\n    \"Check if any of these teams had points scored for Marc Surer specifically\",\n    \"Compare the claim with our findings from step 3\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Check each row in the table for the \"entrant\" column which contains the driver's name.

To find out if anyone else scored the same points as Marc Surer in 1981, we compare the rows where the \"year\" is 1981 and the \"points\" column has a value of 4 (as Marc Surer scored 4 points in 1981). In this table, the Theodore Racing Team and Ensign Racing both scored 4 points.\n4. Determine if those teams scored the same amount of points in both races in 1981. To do this, we check that there are exactly two rows for each team with the year column as 1981, and both rows have the same \"points\" value (4).
