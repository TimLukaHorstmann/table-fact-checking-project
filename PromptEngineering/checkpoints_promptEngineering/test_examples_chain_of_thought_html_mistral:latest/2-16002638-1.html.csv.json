First, identify the team name from the table since the claim doesn't explicitly mention it but we can assume the team playing throughout the table is the same one being discussed (in this case, \"hurricane\").\n\n2. Next, find the year in which the team won 90% of their games and got promoted to a higher division. According to the table, the only year that matches these conditions is 2007.\n\n3. To determine if the team won 90% of their games in 2007, we compare the total number of wins against the total possible games (wins + losses + ties). In this case, the Hurricane won 9 games and lost only 1 game, so they had a total of 10 games (9 + 1) during that season. Therefore, their win percentage is 9/10 = 0.9 or 90%.\n\n4. Finally, check if getting promoted to a higher division follows logically from winning 90% of the games in 2007.
