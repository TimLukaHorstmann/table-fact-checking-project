    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the row corresponding to Jessica Ennis' appearance in the table, as she was Andrew and Jack's guest for one episode. In this case, it's the third row with the \"episode\" value of \"05x03\".\n2. Find out the date of the first broadcast for that specific episode (row) by reading the \"first broadcast\" column. In this case, it's \"4 may 2012\".\n3. Compare the identified date to the target month specified in the claim (\"before May 2012\"). As \"4 May 2012\" falls within May 2012, it does not satisfy the condition of being before May 2012.\n\nFinal answer (in JSON format):\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find Jessica Ennis' appearance row\",\n    \"Identify the first broadcast date for that row\",\n    \"Compare the identified date to the target month ('before May 2012')\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"first broadcast\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"episode\" }\n  ]\n}",
