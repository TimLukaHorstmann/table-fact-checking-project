Identify the claim: The claim states that the crew of expedition Salyut 6 - eo - 1 is Yuri Romanenko and Georgi Grechko, and the crew of Salyut 6 - ep - 1 is Vladimir Dzhanibekov and Oleg Makarov.\n\n2. Extract the information: To verify the claim, we will check the table provided for each expedition's crew. Each row in the table represents an expedition, and the crew members are listed under the \"Crew\" column.\n\n3. Analyze the information: We can see that the crew of Salyut 6 - eo - 1 is indeed Yuri Romanenko and Georgi Grechko (row index 0). Similarly, we can see that the crew of Salyut 6 - ep - 1 is Vladimir Dzhanibekov and Oleg Makarov (row index 1).\n\n4.
