Check the names of provinces for electorates collingwood and cheviot (since they are the ones that may potentially belong to Nelson).\n4. If any of the provinces match Nelson, then it contradicts the claim that \"Nelson is not the province for the electorate of collingwood.\" Otherwise, if no match is found, then it supports the claim.\n5.
