Compare their scores with those in the table. In our table, we see that both players have a score of 209 (-1 to par), according to the \"score\" column.\n3. Identify the position of players based on their scores: The lowest score is considered first place, and players with equal scores are ranked by alphabetical order (last name for multiple players with the same last name, then first name). In our case, we see that there are three players (j b holmes, henrik stenson, and another player with an incomplete name) with a score of 209. As their names start with the same letter, we compare their last names: j b holmes, stenson. Since the alphabetically later player has a lower score, j b holmes is placed first among the tied players for second place.\n4. Identify the par value for second place: We see that there are multiple rows with the same \"to par\" value of -1. However, in golf tournaments, the par value changes depending on the hole. Here we have only one total score for each player, which is compared to par for the entire course. Since we don't know the exact par value for the course, we cannot directly verify if the scores are \"to par.\" But, because all players with a score of 209 have the same \"to par\" value, it doesn't affect the fact that they tie for second place.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the players in question (j b holmes and henrik stenson), compare their scores with those in the table, identify the position based on scores and alphabetical order, and find the par value for second place.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}",

Compare the country of each player with the same score as Sergio Garc\u00eda to ensure that they all come from different countries (as ties are broken by a count-back on the final round, and then by total scores of subsequent rounds, and if still tied, by positions in those rounds).

His score is 211.\n2. Check if there are any players with the same score as Sergio Garc\u00eda. In this case, there are three other players (P\u00e1draig Harrington, Charlie Wi, and a player whose name is not fully visible but has a score of 211). This means they all share the same total score.\n3. Identify the 'to par' column to check if their scores are correct with respect to par. In the table, the 'to par' column indicates how many strokes over or under par a player is. A score of '- 1' means that the player is one stroke under par.\n4. Compare the 'to par' values for each player with the same total score as Sergio Garc\u00eda. In this case, Sergio Garc\u00eda, P\u00e1draig Harrington, and Charlie Wi all have a 'to par' of '- 1'.\n5. Since all players sharing the same total score also share the same 'to par', it implies that they are tied in their final scores.\n6. Determine where they stand in terms of their placement. In this case, the top two players (Ben Curtis and J B Holmes) have a lower total score and are therefore placed ahead of Sergio Garc\u00eda, P\u00e1draig Harrington, and Charlie Wi. The rows marked as 't2' indicate that there is a tie for second place. Since our group of three players has a higher total score, they must be tied for a later position (e.g., 3rd or lower).\n7. Examine the placement of these tied players to find where \"Sergio Garc\u00eda\" and his companions belong. In this case, rows with a 't4' indicate that there is a tie for fourth place.

The claim states that \"Sergio Garc\u00eda, P\u00e1draig Harrington and charlie wi tie for third place with - 1 to par\".
