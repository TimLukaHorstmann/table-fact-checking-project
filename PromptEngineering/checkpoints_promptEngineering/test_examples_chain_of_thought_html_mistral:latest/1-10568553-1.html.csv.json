Since no such definition is provided, we will assume that any intersection or junction mentioned in the table qualifies as a \"major junction\".\n4. Check if there is any other row where 'anne street' appears and compare its milepost value with the first found one. This will ensure that we are considering the same section of 'anne street'.
