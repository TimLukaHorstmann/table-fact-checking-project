    "resp": "1. Identify the information being sought: The claim asks for the private institution that existed from 1839 to 1975 and was located in Hickory, North Carolina.\n\n2. Filter the table based on the existence dates (1839-1975) and location (Hickory, North Carolina). However, it's important to note that no institution in the table meets these criteria exactly as given. The closest match is Mars Hill University, which is near Hickory but does not fit the exact date range specified.\n\n3. Expand the search by considering institutions that might have changed their names or locations over time, but were still operational during the specified period (1839-1975). For example, Lenoir-Rhyne University was originally known as Lenoir Baptist College and later moved to Hickory in 1924.\n\n4. Research historical data outside the table to confirm whether any private institution that existed from 1839 to 1975 was located in or near Hickory, North Carolina and might fit the criteria.\n\n5. Based on the expanded search, it is plausible that Lenoir-Rhyne University could be the institution that fits the claim, but further research would be needed to confirm this due to the lack of exact match and the need to consider name changes or relocations over time.\n\nSince there isn't enough evidence from the given table to definitively confirm the claim, we cannot answer with a simple \"TRUE\" or \"FALSE.\" The claim requires additional research and context that is not provided in the table.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Filter the table based on existence dates (1839-1975) and location (Hickory, North Carolina).\",\n                       \"Expand the search by considering institutions that might have changed their names or locations over time.\",\n                       \"Research historical data outside the table to confirm whether any private institution that existed from 1839 to 1975 was located in or near Hickory, North Carolina.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"INSUFFICIENT DATA\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Location\"}\n  ]\n}",
