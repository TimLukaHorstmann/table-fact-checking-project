In the same row (row 20), we can see the number of electorates for \"sewda\" in the fifth column, which is 130161.\n   3. Compare the found electorate count with the electorate counts of other constituencies to determine if it's the lowest. To do this, we look at the electorate counts in the same column (5th column) for all rows. In our table, there are a total of 9 rows excluding the row containing the total.\n   4. Analyze the electorate counts for all constituencies: [177334, 197183, 205839, 210649, 166893, 130161, 139600, 143593].\n   5.

The constituency numbers are 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and total (which doesn't count as a specific constituency).\n2. For each of these constituencies, check if the number of electorates (which can be considered as votes) is recorded more than once for 'bhind'. The constituencies 9, 10, 11, and 12 are not reserved for Scheduled Castes (SC), so their total votes count only once. Constituency 13 is reserved for SC, but the district remains 'bhind', so it counts as one vote for 'bhind'. Since there's only one record of votes for 'bhind' from constituency 13, we have counted it only once.\n3. Similarly, check if the number of electorates is recorded more than five times for 'datia'. The total number of electorates for all constituencies in 'datia' (20 + 139600 + 143593) equals 1657555. Comparing this to the total number of electorates listed (1371252), we can see that it has been counted five times as it is the sum of the 'number of electorates' from constituencies 20, 21, and 22 plus an additional difference of 306343.\n4.
