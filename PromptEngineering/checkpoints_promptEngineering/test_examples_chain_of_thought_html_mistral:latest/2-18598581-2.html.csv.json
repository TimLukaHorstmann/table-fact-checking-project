I will go through each row (except for the header) and note down the value in the \"opponents\" column. In this case, I find Eccles, Manchester, Dalton Hall Owens Col, and Hurst.\n2. Next, I need to count how many times each opponent appears. For this step, I will compare the first appearance of each opponent with all subsequent appearances. If an opponent's name repeats, it indicates a second (or more) appearance by that opponent. In this case, Eccles appears in two rows (31 january 1885 and 14 february 1885), while the other opponents appear only once.\n3. Finally, I will compare my findings with the claim: \"eccles be the only opponent to play 2 time\".

Identify the latest round date from the table. The last row doesn't specify the round type, so let's consider the final as the latest round (row_index = 4).\n3. Convert both dates into days by breaking them down into year, month, and day components. In this case:\n   - 31 January 1885 = 1885 * 365 + 1 = 676\n   - The final date (25 April 1885) can be approximated as it doesn't have the exact month length (assuming it's the last day of the month): 1885 * 365 + 4 + (4 * 30) = 731\n\n4. Calculate the difference between the two dates in days: |731 - 676| = 55\n\n5. Compare the difference with 3 months, which is approximately 90 days (assuming an average month length of 30 days).

Next, I will examine each row in the table representing a round and check the \"result f - a\" column (fourth column) to see if it contains a '3'.\n3. For the first round (row index 0), the result is '3 - 2', so a '3' is present.\n4. For the first replay of round 1 (row index 1), the result is '3 - 0'. Again, a '3' is present.\n5. The second round does not contain a '3' (it's actually '3 - 0', but the side is not specified). However, we are looking for sides with a '3', so we can ignore this row.\n6. For the semi-finals (row index 3), the result is '4 - 3 (aet)', which does not contain a '3'. Thus, it does not meet our requirement.\n7. Finally, for the final (row index 4), the result is '0 - 3', which again does not contain a '3'.\n8. To check if the claim holds true or false, we should only consider rows where a '3' appears in the result. In this case, there are two such rows (round 1 and round 1 replay).\n9. Since both of these rounds have a '3' as part of their results, the claim is not entirely correct - it needs to specify that at least one side must have a 3, instead of all rounds ending with 3 for one side.
