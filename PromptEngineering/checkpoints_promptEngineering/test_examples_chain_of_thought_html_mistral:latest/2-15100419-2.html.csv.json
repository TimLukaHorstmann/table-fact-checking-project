    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the total number of rows in the table to get an overview of all the data. There are 9 rows in total.\n2. Look through the table to find any player that was picked as a defensive end (position column). Players' positions are linebacker, center, cornerback, wide receiver, and defensive back but not defensive end.\n3. Since no player is listed as a defensive end, I will check if there exists an overall score smaller than 2 for any row to verify the claim that there be no defensive end pick and an overall smaller than 2.\n4. Check each row's overall column for scores smaller than 2. In this table, only one player has an overall score smaller than 2: kevin hardy (row index=0).\n\nNow I will output the final answer in a valid JSON object with the specified format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify total number of rows to get an overview.\",\n    \"Look for defensive end picks in all positions.\",\n    \"Check if there exists any overall smaller than 2.\",\n    \"Examine each row's overall score for numbers less than 2.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"overall\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, the claim is FALSE because there is at least one overall score smaller than 2 (kevin hardy's score).",
