    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. First, identify the title that corresponds to '1958 miles' on Sony after 2006. This will help us narrow down the relevant entries in the table.\n\n2. Scan through the table from top to bottom and note the year and label (or catalog) for each entry where the 'issued title' is '1958 miles'.\n\n3. Find the first instance where both the year is greater than 2006 and the label or catalog matches Sony. In this case, we do not find such an entry.\n\n4. Since there is no entry in the table that matches the given condition, it can be concluded that the claim \"the name of the catalog title '1958 mile' on Sony after 2006 be 20ap 1401\" is FALSE.\n\nHere's my output in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the title that corresponds to '1958 miles' on Sony after 2006.\",\n    \"Scan through the table from top to bottom and note the year and label for each entry where the 'issued title' is '1958 miles'.\",\n    \"Find the first instance where both the year is greater than 2006 and the label or catalog matches Sony.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"label\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"label\" },\n    // ... repeat for each row with 'issued title' equal to '1958 miles', up until the last such entry.\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"label\" }\n  ]\n}",
