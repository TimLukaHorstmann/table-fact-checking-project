    "resp": "Here are the steps for reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the fastest time (ascent time) and the second fastest time from the table. The fastest time is 41:55 (row 1), and the second fastest time is 43:07 (rows 2, 3).\n\n2. Calculate the gap between the fastest and the second fastest times. To do this, subtract the time of the second fastest from the time of the fastest: 41:55 - 43:07 = -1:12. A negative value means that the second fastest time is longer than the fastest time. Since we are looking for a lower gap, the difference between the times can be considered as the gap.\n\n3. Now find the top 13 times in the table and calculate the gap between each pair of consecutive times. Starting from the first row, compare the ascent time of each subsequent row with its predecessor. In this way, we obtain a series of gaps between consecutive times: [43:24-41:55 = -1:29, 43:35-43:24 = 0:11, 43:35-43:12 = 0:23, 43:54-43:35 = 0:19, 43:57-43:54 = 0:03, 44:10-43:57 = 0:13, 44:17-44:10 = 0:07, 43:54-43:54 = 0:00 (ignored), 43:55-44:13 = -0:18, 43:57-43:55 = 0:02, 44:10-43:57 = 0:13, 44:17-44:10 = 0:07, 44:10-43:57 = 0:13].\n\n4. Compare the calculated gap between the fastest and the second fastest times with the series of gaps obtained in step 3. If all the gaps are lower than or equal to the gap between the fastest and the second fastest times, then the claim is true. Otherwise, the claim is false.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the fastest time and the second fastest time\",\n    \"Calculate the gap between them\",\n    \"Find the top 13 times in the table\",\n    \"Calculate the gap between each pair of consecutive times\",\n    \"Compare the calculated gaps with the gap between the fastest and the second fastest times\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ascent time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"ascent time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"ascent time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"ascent time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"ascent time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"ascent time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"ascent time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"ascent time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"ascent time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"ascent time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"ascent time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"ascent time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"ascent time\"}\n  ]\n}",
