    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Identify the claim, which states that when try diff is +15, tries against will be 14.\n2. Examine the table to find a row where try diff equals +15.\n3. Locate the row with team \"castres olympique\". In this row, the value for try diff is +23, which does not equal +15.\n4. Continue examining other rows in the table to see if there's a match. No further matches are found.\n5. Since we haven't found any team with a try diff of exactly +15, it means that the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Examine the table to find a row where try diff equals +15\",\n    \"Locate the row with team 'castres olympique'\",\n    \"Check if the value for try diff in this row equals +15\",\n    \"Continue examining other rows in the table to see if there's a match\",\n    \"Since we haven't found any team with a try diff of exactly +15, it means that the claim is FALSE\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"try diff\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
