    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim to be verified: The claim is that the away team score (home team opponent's score) is 16.22 (118), while the home team score is 20.20 (140).\n\n2. Find the table rows where the 'away team' column matches the team with a score of 16.22 (118): The 'away team' score of 16.22 (118) appears in the second row, where the away team is 'st kilda'.\n\n3. Check if there exists a corresponding home team score that matches the given number (20.20 or 140): In the row where the away team is 'st kilda', the home team score is 21.16 (142). So, there isn't a direct match for the given home team score (20.20 or 140).\n\n4. Consider if it might be possible that the scores are misrepresented as decimals when they should be integers: In this table, both the home and away team scores include decimal points, so it's unlikely that one of them is an integer misinterpreted as a decimal.\n\n5. Search for another row where the 'home team' has a score close to the given number (20.20 or 140), as it could represent a simple transcription error: The closest home team score is in the first row, where the home team is 'footscray' and the score is 7.8 (50). However, this score does not match the given number (20.20 or 140) within a reasonable margin of error for such sports scores.\n\nGiven that there is no row in which the home team score matches the given number (20.20 or 140), and there are no plausible explanations for transcription errors, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim to be verified\",\n    \"Find the table rows where the 'away team' column matches the team with a score of 16.22 (118)\",\n    \"Check if there exists a corresponding home team score that matches the given number (20.20 or 140)\",\n    \"Consider if it might be possible that the scores are misrepresented as decimals when they should be integers\",\n    \"Search for another row where the 'home team' has a score close to the given number (20.20 or 140)\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
