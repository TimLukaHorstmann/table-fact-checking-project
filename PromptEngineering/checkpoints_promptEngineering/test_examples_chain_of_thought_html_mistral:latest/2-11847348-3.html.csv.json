    "resp": "1. Identify the claim: The claim states that Whelan is the only player to score 3 goals in the FA cup.\n\n2. Find the relevant data for Whelan: Scroll through the table and find the row with \"whelan\" in the \"name\" column, which is the second row. In the fourth column (league cup), there is no entry, indicating that Whelan has not scored any goals in the league cup. In the third column (FA cup), there is an entry of 3, indicating that Whelan has scored 3 goals in the FA cup.\n\n3. Compare the data for other players: To check if Whelan is the only one who scored 3 goals in the FA cup, we need to compare his data with other players' data. Look through the table and find all rows where there is an entry in the third column (FA cup). Note that Bok\u0161i\u0107, N\u00e9meth, Ince, Cooper, Queudrue, Marinelli, Mustoe, Deane, Johnston, Greening, Stockdale, Festa, Windass, Southgate, Carbone, Ehiogu, and Murphy have no entry in this column. Only Cambell and the row labeled \"own goals\" have an entry in this column.\n\n4. Analyze the comparison results: The rows for Cambell and \"own goals\" have an entry of 1 in the third column (FA cup). This means that neither of them scored exactly 3 goals in the FA cup, as Whelan did. Therefore, Whelan is not the only player to score 3 goals in the FA cup because there is at least one other instance where a goal was scored in the FA cup by someone else (Cambell or \"own goals\").\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Find the relevant data for Whelan\", \"Compare the data for other players\", \"Analyze the comparison results\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"}\n  ]\n}",
