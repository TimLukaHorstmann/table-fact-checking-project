Lastly, we check if the score before 8 goals was indeed 6-0 within this specific match: We look for a previous row where the \"result\" column is smaller than 8-0 and the following row has a result of 8-0, with the same venue, date, and the difference between the last goal scored in the former row and first goal scored in the latter being 2 goals.
