    "resp": "Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the team for which we are checking the claim - Jabaquara\n2. Iterate through the table to find the row corresponding to the team \"jabaquara\" (row 11)\n3. Check the column \"lost\" in the identified row to determine how many games Jabaquara lost - If the value in this cell is equal to 14, then the claim is true; otherwise, the claim is false.\n4. Since we've already determined that the number of lost games for Jabaquara is indeed 14, we can now check if the claim about \"having 57 against\" is also true.\n5. Check the column \"against\" in the identified row to determine the number of games Jabaquara played - If the value in this cell is equal to 57, then the claim is true; otherwise, the claim is false.\n6. Since we've already determined that the number of games against for Jabaquara is indeed 57, both parts of the claim are true.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify team (jabaquara), find row corresponding to the team, check 'lost' column value, determine if it matches the claim, check 'against' column value and compare with the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"lost\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"against\" }\n  ]\n}",
