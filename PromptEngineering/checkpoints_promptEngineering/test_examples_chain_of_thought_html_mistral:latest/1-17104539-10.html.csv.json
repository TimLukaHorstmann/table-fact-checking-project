    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. First, check the date of each game from the table to find the one corresponding to July 8th. The row number (or \"game\" index) can be determined by looking for the row where the 'date' column has a value of 'july 8'. In this case, it is row 18.\n\n2. After finding the correct row, look at the 'score' column in that row to check whether the score was a loss or not. If it is less than or equal to the opponent's score (which can be found in the row of the same table where the 'date' is the game played on July 8 by the same team as the current row), then it represents a loss. In this case, the score for row 18 is 50 and the opponent's score for that day (July 2) was also 74. Therefore, a loss occurred.\n\nNow let's output the answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, find the row of the game played on July 8.
