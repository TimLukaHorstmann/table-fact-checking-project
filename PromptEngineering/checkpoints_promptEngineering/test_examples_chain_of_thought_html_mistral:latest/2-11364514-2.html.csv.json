Also, we know that the Lord of the Rings musical was nominated for 5 awards in different categories.\n\n2. Verify if the table lists any rows with the specified year (2008) and the specified award (Laurence Olivier Award). The table has five rows matching these conditions.\n\n3. Check if each of these rows indicates a nomination for 'The Lord of the Rings musical'. We can see that each row lists either 'best new musical' or various design categories, which are all associated with productions rather than specific titles. However, the table doesn't explicitly list the musical title in each row.\n\n4. If no rows explicitly mention 'The Lord of the Rings musical', we cannot confirm whether it was nominated for 5 awards in 2008 under the Laurence Olivier Award. But since there are multiple nominations for different categories and the musical itself is nominated for 'best new musical', it's reasonable to infer that other design-related awards could be associated with The Lord of the Rings musical production.\n\n5. Given the lack of explicit mention of the musical title in each row, it is not possible to definitively answer the claim based solely on this table. However, since the table does list multiple nominations for the specified year and award, it suggests that The Lord of the Rings musical may have been nominated for 5 awards, but we cannot confirm this with absolute certainty.\n\nThe final answer would be:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify claim's key elements (year, award, number of categories and nominations).\", \"Verify if table has rows matching specified year and award.\", \"Check if each row indicates nomination for 'The Lord of the Rings musical'.\", \"Infer possible association of design awards with The Lord of the Rings musical production.\", \"Acknowledge lack of explicit mention of the musical title in each row.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"UNKNOWN\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"award\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominee\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nominee\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominee\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nominee\" }\n  ]\n}",

Search through the table to find matching data: In this particular table, there are no rows that match all three criteria (i.e., nominee = Simon Baker, year = 2008, category = best set design).
