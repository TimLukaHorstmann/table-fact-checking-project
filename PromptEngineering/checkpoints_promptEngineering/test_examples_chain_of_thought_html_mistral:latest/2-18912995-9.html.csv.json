The column for nationality confirms this for every racer, and we can see he is from Greece in the 8th row as well.\n4. Note the time for each racer. In the table, times are located in the \"time\" column.\n5. Compare the times of all racers with anastasios gousis. We see that the time for anastasios gousis is 20.75 seconds in the 8th row, under the \"time\" column.\n6. Check if there are any other racers who have a slower time than anastasios gousis. Since all times listed before anastasios gousis's time (19.76 to 20.57) are faster, it means that anastasios gousis has the slowest time among the 8 racers.\n7.
