Identify the claim to be checked: The claim is that Jerry Traino won a total of 2 awards, one for the Lol award (shared with ensemble) and one for Nick UK's funniest person.\n\n2.

Check if the wins match the specified award categories: For the year 2010, Jerry Traino's work \"iCarly\" was nominated for the Big Kid Award and won the Lol Award (shared with ensemble). For the year 2011, \"iCarly\" won the Nick UK's funniest person award.\n\n5.

Determine the final answer: Since Jerry Traino won an individual award under the specified category in 2011, and he also shared a win in a different category not specified in the claim during 2010, we can't confirm that he won exactly 2 awards as claimed.
