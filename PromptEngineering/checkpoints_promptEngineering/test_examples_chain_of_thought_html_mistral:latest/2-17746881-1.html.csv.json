In this table, teams from the same division are listed together and are easily identifiable as they share the same division number in the header row. The rows for fc Mulhouse and US Orl\u00e9ans are therefore:\n   - Row 4: fc mulhouse (d1)\n   - Row 7: us orleans (d2)\n3. Extract the score for each team by looking at the \"score\" column in their respective rows. The scores are given as \"1-3\" for fc Mulhouse and \"3-3\" for US Orl\u00e9ans.\n4. Convert the scores from a string format to integers. For fc Mulhouse, 1 + 3 = 4, and for US Orl\u00e9ans, 3 + 3 = 6.\n5. Compare the scores obtained in step 4. In this case, 4 < 6, which means that the score for fc Mulhouse is less than the score for US Orl\u00e9ans.\n6.
