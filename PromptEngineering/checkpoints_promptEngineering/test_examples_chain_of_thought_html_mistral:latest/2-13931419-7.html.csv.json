    "resp": "Here is my reasoning step-by-step:\n1. Identify the team involved in the game based on the claim, which is between Blue and Penguins.\n2. Check the table to find the row that corresponds to the game between these teams. Since we know it happened on March 20, we can scan through the table looking for this date under the 'date' column.\n3. Once we find the matching date, we can verify if the home team mentioned in the claim (Penguins) is correct by comparing it with the 'home' column of the row. If they match, we proceed to check the score.\n4. Finally, compare the score of the game as given in the table with the score provided in the claim. If they match, then the claim is TRUE.\n\nBased on my reasoning and checking the table, the relevant cells are:\n[\n  { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"home\" }\n]\n\nThe score is also at the same row but in a different column.

    "resp": "Here are the steps I followed to answer the claim:\n\n1. Identify the team involved in the game mentioned in the claim, which is the Kings (home team) and Penguins (visitor team).\n2. Check if any of the games listed in the table have both teams as home and away. Since a single game can't be played at two different locations, it's necessary to find pairs where one team switches roles between rows.\n3. In this table, the required pair is found: Rows 5 (Kings) and 20 (Penguins). Both teams have their positions swapped in these rows compared to their usual roles (home vs visitor).\n4. Compare the score for the game involving the Penguins on row 20 with the claimed score of \"2 - 4\".
