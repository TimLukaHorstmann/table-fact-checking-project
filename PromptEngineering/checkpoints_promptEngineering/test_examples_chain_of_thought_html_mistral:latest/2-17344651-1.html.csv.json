Next, determine whether the table provides information about the Boston Celtics' draft picks in 1984.

To test this, we need to find the pick numbers that correspond to the 1984-85 seasons and check if their nationality is the United States.\n3. To identify the relevant years, we can assume that the 'round' number represents the year (since the first round draft picks are usually made in the same year). The table starts from round 1, so the latest pick in the table (row 10) is presumably from the most recent season. Therefore, to cover the 1984-85 seasons, we need to check picks from rows 1 to 6 (since row 6 corresponds to pick number 139).\n4. Check the 'nationality' column for these picks.
