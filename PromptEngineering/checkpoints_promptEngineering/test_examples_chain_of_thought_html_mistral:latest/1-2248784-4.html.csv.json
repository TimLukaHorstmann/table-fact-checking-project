Check the third column of this row, which contains the 'rank world' value for Iran. Convert this value to an integer, which results in 17.\n4. Identify the region for which we are checking the highest rank: Middle East.\n5. Find the first column of the table, which contains the 'rank mideast' values. The first row (index 0) has a 'rank mideast' value of 1, indicating that Iran ranks first in the Middle East.\n6. Since Iran ranks first in the Middle East and its global rank is 17, it does not have the highest rank in Asia.\n7. Check the second column of the row corresponding to Iran (column 'rank asia'). Convert this value to an integer, which results in 6.\n8. The table shows that Iran ranks sixth in Asia since the rank 6 corresponds to the row where the 'country' value is \"iran\" and the 'rank asia' value is 6.\n9.
