The score column (Column 4) contains numerical values which can be directly compared.\n2. Next, we will check if any team has more than one entry in the table, as the claim specifically mentions \"the first and second\" highest scores. From the table, it appears that all teams have only one entry except for Toronto Eagles (Row 1) and Toronto Rebels (Row 2), both with a score of 98 and 43 respectively.\n3. Since we are looking for the highest scores, the team with the score of 98 (Toronto Eagles) will be considered as having the first highest score and the team with the score of 43 (Toronto Rebels) as having the second highest score.\n4. Lastly, we will check if the \"first and second\" highest scores are by etobicoke kangaroos or toronto eagle: The team etobicoke kangaroos does not have the highest or the second highest score. However, the team toronto eagles (Row 1) has the highest score of 98, so they qualify as having the first highest score. The team with the second highest score (Toronto Rebels - Row 2) is not mentioned in the claim, but since it is a Toronto team, the claim could still hold true as long as the first highest score was by etobicoke kangaroos or toronto eagle.\n\nWith this reasoning, let's provide the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Compare scores to find the highest and second-highest scores\", \"Check if any team has more than one entry in the table\", \"Identify teams with the highest and second-highest scores\", \"Confirm if etobicoke kangaroos or toronto eagle have the first highest score\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]\n}",
