Check the 'head coach' column of the identified row to see if the coach name matches the one in the claim (Ralph Friedgen). In this case, it does.\n4. Check the 'years at school' column of the identified row to see if the number of years matches the one in the claim (10 years).

Find the column that contains the record of each team at their school - \"record at school\". This column helps us determine if a coach has been with the current team for a considerable amount of time, which could impact their ACC conference record.\n3. Since the coach for Miami, Randy Shannon, has only spent 4 years at the school (as indicated in the \"years at school\" column), it is reasonable to assume that most, if not all, of his record at Miami would have been accumulated during his time in the ACC conference.\n4. Find the column that contains the ACC record for each team - \"acc record\". This column will help us determine Miami's record in the ACC conference.\n5. Examine the row corresponding to Miami in the \"acc record\" column, which is 13 (the value in the \"acc record\" cell of the 8th row).\n6. Compare the value obtained in step 5 with the claim - \"miami have a 11 - 13 ACC conference record\".\n7.

In this case, the coach is supposed to be at NC State, but our table shows that Frank Beamer coaches Virginia Tech (the row index is 10 and column name is 'team').\n4.
