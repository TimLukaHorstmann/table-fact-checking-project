Next, I look for the corresponding difference value for 'mackenzie' in the 'difference' column of the table. The difference value for 'mackenzie' is 0, found in row index 5.\n3. Then, I go through each team in the table to find their respective difference values and compare them with the value found for 'mackenzie'.\n4. After comparing all teams, I notice that none of the other teams have a lower difference value than 'mackenzie'.\n5. Therefore, based on my comparison, I conclude that position 5 (represented by team 'mackenzie') has the lowest difference value among all positions in the table.\n\nNow, here's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1) Find the team at position 5 and its corresponding difference value, 2) Compare the difference values of each team with that found for position 5, 3) Conclude whether position 5 has the lowest difference value.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"difference\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
