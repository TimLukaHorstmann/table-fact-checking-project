Find the relevant rows in the table by looking for the date matching '7 april 1987'.

Check the opponent in the final column for the matching row: 'john mcenroe' is present as the value in this column.\n\nBased on the above steps, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the given claim: 'John McEnroe was the opponent in the final on 7 April 1987'\",\n    \"'7 april 1987' is present only once in the table, so we can find the relevant row\",\n    \"Check the opponent column for the matching row: 'john mcenroe' is present as the value\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent in final\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
