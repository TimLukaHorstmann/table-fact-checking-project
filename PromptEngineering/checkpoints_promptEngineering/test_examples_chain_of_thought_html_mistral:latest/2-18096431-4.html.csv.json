Find rows with a score of 66: Scan through the table to find rows where the score is 66. In this case, only one player (Kenny Perry) has a score of 66.\n4. Identify the places for players with a score of 66: Since Kenny Perry's place is 1 and not t2, there are no rows where \"t2\" appears as the place for a 66 score.\n5.

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The United States has a score of 67 by Greg Norman.\n2. Check for the presence of Greg Norman in the table: The table contains players from various countries, including the United States. One of the players in the United States is Greg Norman.\n3. Check if there is a row where player = \"Greg norman\" and country = \"United states\": No such row exists in the table as the country for each row is different from the United States. However, it's important to note that the table only contains scores up to place 10, and Greg Norman appears later in the table (place 23).\n4. Check if there's a discrepancy between the total number of rows and the claim: The table has 12 rows, but the claim mentions only one player (Greg Norman) from the United States. This does not account for all players in the table.\n5. Consider potential reasons for missing data or errors: It is possible that the table is incomplete, as it only contains scores up to place 10 and Greg Norman appears later in the table. Additionally, there might be a transcription error or typo in the claim.\n6. Verify if the score mentioned in the claim (67) matches any scores in the table: There are several players in the United States with a score of 67, but none of them is Greg Norman.\n7.
