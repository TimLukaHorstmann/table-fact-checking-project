Search for relevant rows in the table: Look for the rows where the 'builder nos' is between 1063 and 1065, and the 'rr class' is 'a1'. In this table, such a row is present in the 4th row (year=1914, builder nos=1063-1065, rr class=a1).\n\n3.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that before 1914, the rr number of Hudswell Clarke was 15 and 18 - 22.\n\n2. Determine the rr numbers for each builder in the table. To find the rr numbers of Hudswell Clarke, focus on the rows where the \"builder\" column is \"hudswell clarke\".\n\n3. Identify the years when Hudswell Clarke built locomotives: The first row of Hudswell Clarke data is from 1911, and there are subsequent rows in 1914, 1916, and 1918.\n\n4. Check if any rr numbers match the given claim values (15 or 18 - 22) for Hudswell Clarke before 1914: In the table, there is no row where both the year is before 1914 and the \"rr nos\" contains 15. However, there are rows with rr numbers from 18 to 22 (18 in 1911, 19 - 22 in 1916).\n\n5. Compare with the claim: The given claim states that before 1914, the rr number of Hudswell Clarke was 15 and 18 - 22. Since there is no row where the year is before 1914 and the \"rr nos\" contains exactly 15, but there are rows with rr numbers from 18 to 22 in years before 1914, the claim is not fully correct as it should mention only rr numbers from 18 to 22.\n\nThe final answer will be:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Determine the rr numbers for each builder in the table\",\n    \"Identify the years when Hudswell Clarke built locomotives\",\n    \"Check if any rr numbers match the given claim values (15 or 18 - 22) for Hudswell Clarke before 1914\",\n    \"Compare with the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"rr nos\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"rr nos\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"rr nos\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"builder\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
