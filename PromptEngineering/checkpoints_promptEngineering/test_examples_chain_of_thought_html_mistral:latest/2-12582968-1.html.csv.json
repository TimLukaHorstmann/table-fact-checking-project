Iterate through the table rows from the most recent year (2013) backwards to find the last two years of competition for Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich.\n\n3. For each row, check if the athlete's name matches \"Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich\". If it does not match, discard the row and continue with the next one.\n\n4. Once we have found two rows where the athlete's name matches Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich, record their row indices (e.g., 9 for 2013 and 8 for 2012).\n\n5. To calculate the average distance, find the 'position' column values of these two rows as they represent the years of the last 2 competitions. In this case, we have a position of 3rd in 2013 (row 9) and 6th in 2012 (row 8).\n\n6. Since positions are not distances, we need to look for the 'notes' column values which provide the actual throw distances for each competition. In this case, we have a throw distance of 79.36 m in 2013 (row 9) and 77.17 m in 2012 (row 8).\n\n7. Calculate the average distance by adding both distances and dividing by 2: (79.36 + 77.17) / 2 = 78.27 m.\n\n8.
