Check each team's result in the 'recopa 1994' column to see if they qualified or participated.\n4. Analyze the data in the table:\n   - Independiente is listed as champions, which means they won the Recopa 1994 and are therefore available.\n   - V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield is listed as runners-up, which means they lost to the champions (Independiente) in the final of the tournament. Since they reached the final, they can be considered as participating in the Recopa 1994 and are therefore available.\n   - No other teams have any mention of the Recopa 1994 in their respective rows.\n5.
