    "resp": "1. Identify the data presented: The table contains the scores from various years of a championship, with each row representing a year and each column providing information such as the name of the player who won that year's championship and their score.\n\n2. Define the question: Determine whether it is true that the lowest championship score was a tie between John Jackson and Webb Heintzelman at 205.\n\n3. Locate the relevant rows for John Jackson and Webb Heintzelman in the table, based on their last names given in the question. In this case, we can find John Jackson in row 1980 (row_index: 1980) and Webb Heintzelman in row 1988 (row_index: 1988).\n\n4. Extract the scores for both players from the relevant rows by looking at the column containing their score values. For John Jackson, the score is located in the cell with column name \"Score\" and row index 1980 (John Jackson's row), which gives us the value of 205. Similarly, for Webb Heintzelman, we find the value of 205 in the cell with column name \"Score\" and row index 1988 (Webb Heintzelman's row).\n\n5. Compare the scores found in step 4. If both players have the same score, then it is a tie. In this case, John Jackson and Webb Heintzelman both have a score of 205, making it a tie.\n\n6.
