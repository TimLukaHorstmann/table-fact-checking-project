Find the row corresponding to this driver in the table. In this table, rows are identified by the \"name\" column. Since the driver's name is \"marcus marshall\", we search for the row where the \"name\" column has this value.\n3. In the row of Marcus Marshall, find the cell containing his best time. The best time for each driver is represented in the fourth column and is labeled as \"best\".\n4.

To do this, I will iterate through each row in the table and compare the qual 2 times and best times for each driver to see if they meet the specified criteria (qual 2 <= 58 and best >= 57).\n\n3.
