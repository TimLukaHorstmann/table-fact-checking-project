Compare the percentage of popular votes for each election: To determine if 2008 was the second-highest percentage of popular votes, we need to compare the percentage values in the table for each year and find the second highest value.\n\n3. Sort the percentage values in descending order: By sorting the percentages from the highest to the lowest, it will be easier to find the second highest value.\n\n4.
