No specific conference is mentioned, so we can infer it from the table's context or check if there are any common elements among the rows that joined in 1970.\n2. Look at each row's \"year joined\" column to determine which schools joined in 1970: Chesterton, Portage, and Valparaiso.\n3. Check the \"previous conference\" column for the schools that joined in 1970. We are looking for commonalities or similarities to infer if they were part of the same conference before joining. In this case, both Chesterton and Portage mention Calumet as their previous conference.\n4. Since Valparaiso mentions \"independents\" as its previous conference, it is not directly related to the other two schools that joined in 1970. However, since there is no clear indication of a common conference for these three schools before 1970, we can still consider them to be part of the same conference if they joined at the same time (1970).\n5.
