We can see that the only player from this list who was drafted by the Flyers is Joni Pitkanen, as his position (row 1) matches with one of the picks of the Philadelphia Flyers (round 1).\n2. Check if any other players were picked before the 4th round. We can see that Joni Pitkanen was picked in the first round (row 1), which is before the 4th round.\n3. Compare the number of players drafted by Philadelphia Flyers who were picked before the 4th round with the total number of players they drafted. Since we have found only one player, Joni Pitkanen, who was drafted before the 4th round and this is the only player from the list who was drafted by Philadelphia Flyers, it means that all their picks before the 4th round are accounted for in our table.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.

However, the table provides the player's name, position, nationality, and current team (which might give a hint about their professional career timeline).\n\n3. Analyze the provided data: The table shows that Joni Pitkanen played as a defenseman for Karpat in the Liiga (Finland) at round 1. This suggests that he was likely drafted before other players listed, but we cannot determine his exact position among the 4 defensemen selected in any specific year without additional data or context.\n\n4.
