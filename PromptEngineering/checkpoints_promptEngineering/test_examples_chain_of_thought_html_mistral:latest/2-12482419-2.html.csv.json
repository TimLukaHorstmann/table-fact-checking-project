However, the table only provides win percentages and GBs are not explicitly stated. We will have to infer the GB from the number of games behind the first place team, as this is the closest approximation available in the given data.\n\n2. Find the relevant rows: Since the GB is not provided, we need to find all rows where the team is either in 1st or 2nd position (since they are most likely within GB=5 of each other). In this table, the first place teams are those with the highest wins and lowest losses. We notice that there are 6 such seasons: 1978, 1980, 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2016.\n\n3. Calculate the win percentage for each relevant season: For each of the six seasons, we find the win percentage (wins / (wins + losses)) from the given table.\n\n4. Find the average win percentage: After calculating the win percentage for each relevant season, we take their average to get the overall win percentage for a season with GB=5.\n\nThe calculation results in an average win percentage of approximately 0.62 (62%), which is different from the claimed value of 0.535 (53.5%).

To find the average win percentage of a season with a GB of 5, we need to find all seasons where the team had a Game Back (GB) of 5 and calculate their win percentages.\n2.
