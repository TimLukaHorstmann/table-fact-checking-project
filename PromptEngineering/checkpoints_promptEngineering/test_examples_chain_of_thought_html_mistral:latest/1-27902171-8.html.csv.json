Compare the count with the total games played by the team: If the number of high-assist games for N McMillan equals or exceeds the total number of games played by the SuperSonics, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the team in question (Seattle SuperSonics), Determine how many high assists by N McMillan for the team (count instances where N McMillan has 4 or more assists), Compare the count with the total games played by the team.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Assists\"},\n    ...
