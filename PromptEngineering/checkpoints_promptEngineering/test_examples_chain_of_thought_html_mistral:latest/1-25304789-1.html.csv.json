The number of viewers for \"a modest proposal\" is in the cell where the row_index is 1 and the column_name is 'viewers'. Similarly, the number of viewers for \"no strings attached\" is in the cell where the row_index is 2 and the column_name is 'viewers'.\n\n3.

After conversion, I can compare the values directly.\n\nNow, here is my final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find the number of viewers for 'a modest proposal' and 'no strings attached'.

Compare the 'order' column values for each episode mentioned in the claim (\"detour\" and \"baby got bank\") to determine their order (the one with the lower 'order' value comes first).\n2. Check if both episodes have different 'us air date'. If they share the same date, it means they aired at the same time and thus cannot follow the sequence specified in the claim.\n3. Compare the 'us air date' of \"detour\" with \"a modest proposal\". If the date of \"detour\" is later than that of \"a modest proposal\", then the episodes can be arranged according to the claim (since \"a modest proposal\" cannot be after \"detour\").\n4.
