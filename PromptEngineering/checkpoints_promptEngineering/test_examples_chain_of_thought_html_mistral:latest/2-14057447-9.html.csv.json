Identify the table data: The table contains game records between Boston Bruins and Pittsburgh Penguins from May 1 to May 11, but no information about conference or season year is provided.\n2. Check for consistency with a known conference final series: A conference final series in ice hockey typically consists of at least six games, with the team that wins three games advancing to the Stanley Cup Final. The given table only shows seven games between the two teams.\n3. Verify if any team won four games (or more): In the given data, Pittsburgh Penguins have won four games, while Boston Bruins have lost five games and one game resulted in overtime (which we can consider a loss for this analysis).\n4. Check if the winning team's record matches the requirement: The requirement is that Pittsburgh Penguins win 4 out of 6 or 7 games to win the conference final. In our case, they have won four games in seven games played.\n5. Identify inconsistencies with the claim: The given claim specifies the year as 1990/91, but there's no way to verify this information from the provided table data. However, since the number of games and the winning team's record match the conference final requirement, it is possible that this series took place in the specified year.\n6. Finalize the answer: Based on the available information, we cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim about the game results being from the 1990/91 season.

However, the table doesn't specify that these are all the games in the series, so we will proceed with our analysis based on the given data.\n3. Find the first two wins by Pittsburgh Penguins: To determine if the Penguins won the first 2 games, we need to check their victories up until the third game (May 3) since the series isn't complete in the table. If the Penguins have won more than one match before the third game, it would mean they won the first 2 games according to the information given.\n4.
