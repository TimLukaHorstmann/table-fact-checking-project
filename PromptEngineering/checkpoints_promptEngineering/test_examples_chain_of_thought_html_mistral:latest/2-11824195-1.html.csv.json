Locate the row in the table where the opponent is the Miami Dolphins. In this case, it's on row 10.\n3. Check the Attendance column (column 4) for that specific row: The value for row 10, column 4 is \"34063\".\n4. Compare the claim with the value found in step 3: The claim states that the attendance for the game against the Miami Dolphins was 34063.
