    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the player who has made 19 attempts. In this table, there is no player who has exactly 19 attempts.\n2. Since the question asks for the total number of \"long\" when there are 19 attempts, and we found that there is no such player in the given table, it means that the total number of \"long\" when there are 19 attempts should be zero (since all the rows in the table have non-zero values in their respective \"long\" column).\n3. Therefore, to confirm if our reasoning is correct, we check if there exists a row with a \"long\" value of 14 and an \"attempts\" value of 19. Since no such row exists, it confirms that the total number of \"long\" when there are 19 attempts should be zero.\n\n   Final answer:\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the player with 19 attempts, find if there is a row with 'long' = 14 and 'attempts' = 19, check if the total number of 'long' for all rows where 'attempts' = 19 should be zero\"],\n     \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       {\n         \"row_index\": 0,\n         \"column_name\": \"attempts\"\n       },\n       {\n         \"row_index\": 0,\n         \"column_name\": \"long\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }",

Extract the relevant data from the table: To determine the average, we need to calculate it for each player and compare it with 2.6. We also need to find out how many touchdowns were scored by players whose averages are less than 2.6.\n\n3. Calculate the average for each player: Average is calculated by dividing total yards by the number of attempts.\n\n4. Compare the averages with 2.6: Check if any of the averages are less than 2.6.\n\n5. Find the number of touchdowns when the averages are less than 2.6: Count the number of players whose averages are less than 2.6 and who have scored a touchdown.\n\nNow, let's find the relevant cells for each player and their respective statistics:\n\n1. stephen davis - { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"average\" }, { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"touchdowns\" }\n2. larry centers - { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"average\" }, { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"touchdowns\" }\n3. james thrash - { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"average\" }, { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"touchdowns\" }\n4. skip hicks - { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"average\" }, { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"touchdowns\" }\n5. brad johnson - { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"average\" }, { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"touchdowns\" }\n\nAfter calculating the averages and counting the touchdowns for players with averages less than 2.6, we find that there is indeed 1 player (stephen davis) who has scored a touchdown with an average less than 2.6.
