Determine Aniket Dhadphale's nationality based on the team he plays for and his location: If Aniket Dhadphale is an NHL player, then we can assume that he plays for a team in North America (either the U.S. or Canada). I will search through his row to find out if there are any clues regarding his nationality, such as team location or high school location.\n3. Check Aniket Dhadphale's country of origin based on the information provided: In this case, the table provides the specific team (San Jose Sharks) and Aniket Dhadphale's location (Northwood Prep in New York), but it does not specify his nationality. However, I can assume that since he plays for an American-based team and attends a high school in the U.S., Aniket Dhadphale is likely from the United States.\n4. Summarize my reasoning: After reviewing the information provided, I found that Aniket Dhadphale is an NHL player for the San Jose Sharks, who attended Northwood Prep in New York.
