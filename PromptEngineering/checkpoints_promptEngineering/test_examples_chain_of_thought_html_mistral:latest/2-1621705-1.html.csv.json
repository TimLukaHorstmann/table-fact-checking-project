No such row is found.\n5. Compare the given claim with the data: The highest standard for SO2 in the table, which is found in step 4, is 0.14 ppm (365 \u03bcg / m\u00b3\u00b3). The claim states that the allowable standard for SO2 should be at 35 ppm for a 1-hour time. Since the highest standard found is significantly lower than 35 ppm, it contradicts the given claim.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the pollutant (SO2), find its row in the table, check for the standard values under each row, search for any other rows with higher standards for SO2, compare the given claim with the data.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"standard\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"standard\" }\n  ]\n}",
