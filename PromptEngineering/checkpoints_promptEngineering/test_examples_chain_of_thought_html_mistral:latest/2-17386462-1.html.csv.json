The lowest number of losses indicates the least number of games won, as a goal against represents a loss. In this case, the team with 91 goals against (Netherfield) has lost the most games.\n2. To find the teams with the most game draws, look for rows where the difference between 'Goals For' and 'Goals Against' is zero. The 'Goals For' column represents the number of games won, and the 'Goals Against' column represents the number of games lost (when equal, it indicates a draw). In this table, both Southport (65 goals for, 65 goals against) and Gateshead (70 goals for, 70 goals against) have 14 draws.\n3. To determine the team with the most goals overall, add up the 'Goals For' column for each team and compare the results. In this table, the team with the highest number of goals is Bangor City, with 108 goals.\n\nanswer: TRUE\nrelevant_cells: [\n  { \"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Goals For\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Goals Against\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Goals Against\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Goals Against\" }\n]",
