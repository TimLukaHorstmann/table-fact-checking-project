    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the teams (entrant) that use Lotus chassis. From the table, we see that \"camel team lotus\" and \"braun tyrrell honda\" used Lotus chassis in 1987, 1988, and 1991. However, the chassis changes for these teams from 1987 to 1988 (Lotus 99t to Lotus 100t) and from 1988 to 1991 (Lotus 100t to Tyrrell 020).\n\n2. Count the number of times Lotus chassis is used. Since there are two different chassis models (Lotus 99t and Lotus 100t/Tyrrell 020) used by Lotus-associated teams, we can't simply count the instances to find out how many chassis were produced.\n\n3. Identify the engines (engine) associated with Honda. From the table, we see that \"camel team lotus honda\" and \"braun tyrrell honda\" used Honda engines in 1987, 1988, and 1991.\n\n4. Count the number of times Honda engines are used. In this case, we can count the instances directly since there is only one type of Honda engine (honda v6 or honda v10) used by Honda-associated teams.\n\n5. Compare the counts for Lotus chassis and Honda engines. Since we couldn't find a consistent number of Lotus chassis, we cannot definitively say whether Lotus and Honda produce the same number of chassis at 3 each (FALSE).
