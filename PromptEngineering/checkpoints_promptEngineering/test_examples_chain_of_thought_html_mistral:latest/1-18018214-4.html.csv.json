The club's row index is 7.\n\n2. Check the number of games played by the club. This value can be found in the \"games played\" column for the club's row. The value is 14.\n\n3. Calculate the total goals scored by the club during these games. The sum of the values in the \"goals scored\" column for the club's row should be added up to find this total. In this case, the total number of goals scored by mituva jurbarkas is 12 (row_index = 7, column_name = 'goals scored').\n\n4. Divide the total number of goals scored by the number of games played to get the average goal per game. In this case, the average goal per game would be calculated as follows: 12 / 14 \u2248 0.857 (rounded to two decimal places).\n\n5. Compare the calculated average with the claim's condition (\"only cones time an average of 1 goal per game played\"). The value obtained in step 4 (0.857) is not equal to 1, so it does not meet the claim's condition.\n\n6.
