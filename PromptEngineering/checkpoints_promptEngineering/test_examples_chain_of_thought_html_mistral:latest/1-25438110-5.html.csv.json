Identify the claim: The claim is that the casino labeled as '32' (washoe) has the highest earnings on road 'i - 80' for the years 2008, 2009, and 2010.\n\n2. Find the row corresponding to 'washoe' in the table: The row index of 'washoe' is 1, as it can be found in the second row of the table with a casino ID of 32.\n\n3. Compare the earnings for 2008, 2009, and 2010 for the selected row: The years 2008, 2009, and 2010 are represented by the columns 'fy08 millions', 'fy09 millions' and there is no column for 'fy10 millions'. However, we can infer that the earnings for 2010 would be less than or equal to the earnings for 2009 because the data goes in chronological order.\n\n4. Verify if the earnings of washoe are higher than other rows' earnings on road 'i - 80' for the available years: In the given table, there are no other rows with a casino on road 'i - 80'. Therefore, since there is no competition to compare against, we can't make a conclusive statement about whether the earnings of washoe are highest in 2008 and 2009.
