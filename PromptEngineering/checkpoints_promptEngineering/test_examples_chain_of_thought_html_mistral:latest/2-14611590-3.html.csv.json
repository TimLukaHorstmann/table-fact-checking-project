Compare the event count for each player: After sorting the table by events (if required), check if Billy Mayfair has more events than any other player.\n\n6. Calculate total events for Billy Mayfair: In this case, Billy Mayfair has 28 events in the provided data.\n\n7. Check if there are other players with equal or greater number of events: Check through the table to see if anyone else shares the same or higher event count as Billy Mayfair.\n\nBased on these steps and given the table provided, we cannot confirm whether the claim is true or false without knowing the specific year for this data.
