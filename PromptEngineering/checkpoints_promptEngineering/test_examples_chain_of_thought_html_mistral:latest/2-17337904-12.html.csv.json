This helps me narrow down the potential characters who could be 'xiong yan the elder' or 'xiong yong'.\n\n2. I find two rows with 'chu' as their state: one for 'xiong yan the elder' and another for 'xiong yong'.\n\n3. Next, I will compare the 'title' column in each of these two rows to determine if both have the same title. If they do, it would support the claim that \"the title be viscount for both xiong yan the elder and xiong yong\".\n\n4. Upon inspection, I find that both 'xiong yan the elder' and 'xiong yong' have a 'title' of 'viscount'.\n\n5.
