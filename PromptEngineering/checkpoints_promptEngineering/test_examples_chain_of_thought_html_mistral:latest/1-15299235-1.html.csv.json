Check for potential errors in the given data or claim: It's possible that there might be a mistake in the racer's name (Mario Simone Timelli) or the round number (9). The provided data shows only racers named Julian Simon, Hector Barbera, Marco Simoncelli, Nicolas Terol, Pol Espargaro, and Hiroshi Aoyama.\n\n4. Verify the given claim against the data: Since Mario Simone Timelli is not listed as a racer in this data, it's impossible to verify if he won round 9.\n\nWith no confirmation that Mario Simone Timelli participated in these races, I cannot definitively answer the claim.
