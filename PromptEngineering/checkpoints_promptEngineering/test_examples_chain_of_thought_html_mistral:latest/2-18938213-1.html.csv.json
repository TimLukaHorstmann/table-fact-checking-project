Examine the table column names for the relevant information: The table contains columns for year, place, gold medalist, silver medalist, and bronze medalist.\n3. Check if there's a row in the table that matches the year (1982) and the silver medalist (yuri kadenatsy).\n4. In the table, look for the row where the 'year' is 1982 and the 'silver' cell contains \"yuri kadenatsy (urs)\".\n5. If such a row exists, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's output the result in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Examine table column names for relevant info\",\n    \"Check if there's a row with the correct year and silver medalist\",\n    \"Look for the specific row in the table\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"silver\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Find the relevant rows in the table for the year 1983: Scroll through the table to find the row with \"1983\" in the \"year\" column. The relevant row is the sixth one from the top.\n   3. Check if there is a silver medal winner in the \"silver\" column for the relevant row: In the \"silver\" column of the sixth row, we find \"nikolai dedov ( urs )\".\n   4. Compare the silver medal winner with the claim: The silver medal winner in 1983, according to the table, is not yuri kadenatsy but nikolai dedov.\n   5. Draw a conclusion based on the comparison: Since the silver medal winner in 1983 is not yuri kadenatsy as stated in the claim, the claim is FALSE.\n\nOutput in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Find the relevant rows for the year 1983\",\n    \"Check if there is a silver medal winner in the 'silver' column for the relevant row\",\n    \"Compare the silver medal winner with the claim\",\n    \"Draw a conclusion based on the comparison\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"silver\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
