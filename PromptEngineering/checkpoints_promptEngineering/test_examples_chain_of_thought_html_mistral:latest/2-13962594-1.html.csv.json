The scores are presented as wins (W) or losses (L), followed by a space and then the score in numerals. For example, \"34 - 10\" indicates that the team won with a score of 34 and the opponent lost with a score of 10.\n\n2. To find the sum of points for each game, we need to convert these scores into numbers. To do this, we can split the string in each cell at the space character, and then convert both parts of the resulting array (the team's score and the opponent's score) to integers.\n\n3. After converting all the scores to numbers, we can now check if any pair of scores adds up to a value greater than 80. We start from the first row and move down through each row in the \"result\" column.\n\n4. In this table, the maximum sum of points for any game is 40 + 28 = 68 (from the game against Denver Broncos), which is less than 80.

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that \"three games have a score bigger than 85\". The score in this context can be assumed to be the sum of points for both teams, as it's the only numerical value in the 'result' column that could represent a score.\n2. Extract the scores from the table: Since we need to compare each game's score with 85, we first need to extract the values from the 'result' column and convert them into numbers. In this case, the scores are the difference between the two integers in each 'result' cell.\n3. Compare each score with 85: For each row in the table, subtract the two integers in the 'result' cell to get the score. Then compare each score with 85 to see if it is greater than or equal to that value. If a score is equal to or greater than 85, it means three games had scores higher than 85.\n4. Check for multiple instances: If we find more than three instances where the score is greater than or equal to 85, we can immediately stop our search as we have already found more than three such games.\n5. Return the final answer: Based on our analysis, return a JSON object with the appropriate format and either \"TRUE\" or \"FALSE\".\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Extract the scores from the table\", \"Compare each score with 85\", \"Check for multiple instances\", \"Return the final answer\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\" }\n  ]\n}",
