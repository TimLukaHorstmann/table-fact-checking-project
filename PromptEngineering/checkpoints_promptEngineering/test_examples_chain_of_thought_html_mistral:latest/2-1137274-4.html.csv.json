    "resp": "Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. Examine the table to determine if the episodes are named after the location where they take place.\n2. Compare the 'title' column with the 'original air date' column to see if there's a pattern of naming episodes after the locations where they are set.\n3. Check each row to see if the title matches the date's location, ignoring cases where the date's location is in the format \"Day Month, Year\" (e.g. \"January 21, 2005\").\n4. If a majority of episodes are named after their respective locations, then the claim would be TRUE. If not, then the claim would be FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Examine the table to determine if the episodes are named after the location where they take place.\",\n    \"Compare the 'title' column with the 'original air date' column to see if there's a pattern of naming episodes after the locations where they are set.\",\n    \"Check each row to see if the title matches the date's location, ignoring cases where the date's location is in the format 'Day Month, Year'\",\n    \"If a majority of episodes are named after their respective locations, then the claim would be TRUE.
