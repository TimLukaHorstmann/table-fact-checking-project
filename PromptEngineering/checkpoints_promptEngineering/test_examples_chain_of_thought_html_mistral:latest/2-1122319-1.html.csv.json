    "resp": "Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that there exists a driver who started on the grid (grid column) with 104 laps (laps column) and a time/retired of +6.18 (time/retired column).\n2. Scan through the table to find any row that matches the given criteria:\n   - Check the number of laps for each driver: The values for the laps column are either specific numbers or have a \"+\" sign followed by a number (indicating a retirement after a certain number of laps). No value in the table is 104.\n   - Check the grid positions: Each driver has a unique grid position represented by the integer in the grid column. There's no repeat of this value, so it seems that each driver started on a different grid position.\n   - The time/retired column shows either specific times or a \"+\" sign followed by a number (indicating retirement after a certain number of laps). No value is exactly \"+6.18\".\n3. Based on the above findings, there's no row in the table that matches the given claim criteria, so the answer is FALSE.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Scan through the table to find any row that matches the given criteria\", \"Check the number of laps for each driver\", \"Check the grid positions\", \"Check the time/retired column\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
