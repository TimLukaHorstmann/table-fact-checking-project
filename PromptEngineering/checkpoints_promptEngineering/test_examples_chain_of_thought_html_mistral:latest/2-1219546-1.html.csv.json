Determine if the World Series consists of more than one game: In a series, multiple games are played, so it's reasonable to assume that having games at two different stadiums indicates that the games are part of a World Series.\n3. Check for inconsistencies in the data: There are no missing dates or other anomalies that would call into question the idea that these games constitute a World Series.\n4. Confirm that the number of games played at each stadium is sufficient to support a World Series: A seven-game series requires four games at one stadium and three at another. In this case, we see four games at Dodger Stadium and three at Yankee Stadium, which aligns with the requirement for a World Series.\n5.
