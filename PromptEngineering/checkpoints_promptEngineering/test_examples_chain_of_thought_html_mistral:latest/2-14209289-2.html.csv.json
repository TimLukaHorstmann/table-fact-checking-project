    "resp": "1. First, we need to understand the given claim: The claim states that before October 15th, Montreal has not been the home team and has a record of 3-0-2.\n\n2. Next, we will iterate through the table to find any instances where Montreal is the visitor.\n\n3. We start at the first row and go through each row in the table to check if the \"visitor\" column matches \"montreal\". If it does, we will remember that date for further reference.\n\n4. In this table, Montreal appears as the visitor on October 15th.\n\n5. Now, let's see if there is any other instance before October 15th where Montreal was the home team, which would contradict the claim. To do this, we will iterate through the table again but check for instances where Montreal is in the \"home\" column instead of the \"visitor\" column.\n\n6. In this table, there are no instances where Montreal is listed as the home team before October 15th.\n\n7. Since Montreal was not the home team before October 15th and they were the visitor on that date, their record (3-0-2) meets the condition specified in the claim.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Understand the claim\",\n    \"Iterate through the table to find instances where Montreal is the visitor\",\n    \"Find out if there are any instances where Montreal is the home team before October 15th\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"home\" }\n  ]\n}",
