From the table, the only row where the 'opponent' is Bonnie Gadusek and the 'outcome' is 'runner - up' is in the 6th row (indexed from 0).\n\n2. Check the score for this match: The score should be present in the 6th row and 5th column of the table, i.e., the cell with row_index=5 and column_name='score'.\n\n3.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Check the table to find out if any tournament held at \"knokke\" has \"carpet (i)\" as its surface. This will help us determine if the tournament exists in the given date range.\n2. Identify all the rows where the 'tournament' column is \"knokke\". There is only one match that satisfies this condition.\n3. Check the surface for the row identified in step 2. If it is \"carpet (i)\", then we have found a tournament at knokke with carpet (i) surface, and we can proceed to further checks. In this case, the surface is indeed \"carpet (i)\" for the row with index 8.\n4. Now that we know the match exists, check the opponent's name for the same row. If it matches 'Elise Burgin', then the claim is true. In this case, the opponent is 'Bettina Bunge', which doesn't match Elise Burgin.\n5.
