This means we need to check if there is a row in the table where the year is 1908 and the '54 holes' column mentions a 5 shot lead.\n\n2. Scan the table: Start from the top of the table and move down, looking for the row that corresponds to the year 1908.\n\n3. Extract relevant information: Once we find the row corresponding to 1908, we need to check if the '54 holes' column mentions a 5 shot lead. In this case, the text in the '54 holes' column for the year 1908 is \"6 shot lead\".\n\n4. Compare the claim with the extracted information: The information we extracted shows that there was indeed a 6 shot lead in 1908 during the open championship, which is not what the claim states (5 shots instead of 6).

However, since the claim does not match with the year 1908, we need to investigate other rows as well.\n3. Check if there are any other rows that have 'the open championship' in the second column (championship). We find another occurrence of this title in the first row with the year 1901 and the third row with the year 1906.\n4. The claim states that the 54 hole for the open championship (4) was a 6 shot lead, so we need to check if any of these rows have a '54 holes' column indicating a 6 shot lead.\n5. In the first row, the '54 holes' column indicates a 5 shot lead, which doesn't match our claim.\n6.
