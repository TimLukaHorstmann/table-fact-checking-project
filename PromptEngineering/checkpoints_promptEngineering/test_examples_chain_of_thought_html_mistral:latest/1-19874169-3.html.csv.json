Each row represents a different radio station, with columns for branding (station name), callsign, frequency, power, and location.\n2. We then look for the row that contains the callsign \"dxyr\". In this case, it's in the fifth row.\n3. The fourth column of the fifth row shows the frequency for the callsign dxyr, which is 104.7 mhz.\n4. Now we compare this value with the claim: \"the frequency for callsign dxyr be from brand yes! fm 101.1\". We see that the frequency (104.7 mhz) doesn't match the brand (yes! fm 101.1).\n5.
