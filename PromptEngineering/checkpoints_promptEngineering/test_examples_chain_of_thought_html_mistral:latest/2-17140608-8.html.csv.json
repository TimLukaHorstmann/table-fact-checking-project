This will help us compare how many times Ray Allen scored 30 points or more in a game.\n3. Scroll through the table to quickly find instances where Ray Allen scored 30 points or more. In this case, we see that Row 60 has the score for Ray Allen as \"30\".\n4. Since there is only one instance of Ray Allen scoring 30 points or more, and it occurred in game 60 (Row 60), we conclude that in the given table, Ray Allen scored the most points over 59 games in Row 60.\n\nHere is the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the number of games in the table.\",\n    \"For each game, find the score for Ray Allen.\",\n    \"Scroll through the table to quickly find instances where Ray Allen scored 30 points or more.\",\n    \"Conclude that in the given table, Ray Allen scored the most points over 59 games in Row 60.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 60,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Check the 'game' column for the corresponding row to confirm if it matches with the game we are looking for. In this case, the value is '53', which corresponds to the game against San Antonio.\n3. Check the 'score' column for the corresponding row to find the score of the game. In this case, the score is given as 'l 99 - 105 (ot)'. To interpret this correctly, we need to recognize that 'l' stands for loss and convert the scores into a single value. So, the correct score would be 105 - 99 = 6.\n4.

Find all rows where the high points value is greater than or equal to the high points value of game 59: To answer the claim, we need to find any other games in which Rondo scored more points than his 20 points from game 59.
