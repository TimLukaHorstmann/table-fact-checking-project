It appears to be a list of golf scores from a tournament, where each row represents a player, their country (or place if it's Scotland), their score over four rounds, how many strokes they were under par (to par), and their prize money.\n\n2. To determine whether the 1st place finisher and the last place finisher are separated by only 11 points, we need to find out who the 1st and last place finishers are and calculate their scores.\n\n3. From the table, we can see that the player with the lowest score (283) is Byron Nelson, who is in 1st place (row 1). The players with the highest scores are Leonard Dodson and Jimmy Hines, who are tied for 10th place (rows 10-11), each with a score of 294.\n\n4. To find out if they are separated by only 11 points, we subtract Byron Nelson's score from the combined scores of Dodson and Hines: 294 - 283 = 11.\n\n5.

However, given that the table contains data for golf players, scores, and countries which are typical characteristics of a golf tournament, it is likely to be a golf tournament.\n\n2. Secondly, we check if each player in the table has played four rounds of the tournament.
