Narrow down the rows of the table to only those that have \"leyton house\" as the entrant team for a given year and check the engine type.\n3. For the years 1988, 1989, and 1990, the engine is Judd V8 in all cases. This means Judd V8 was used in three out of four races by Mauricio Gugelmin (1989 has two rows due to different chassis).\n4. In 1991, Mauricio Gugelmin switched to an Ilmor V10 engine as his team changed to \"leyton house\". So, Judd V8 was not the engine used in that year.\n5. In 1992, Mauricio Gugelmin did not race for Leyton House but rather for Sasol Jordan Yamaha, so this data point is irrelevant to our analysis.\n6.
