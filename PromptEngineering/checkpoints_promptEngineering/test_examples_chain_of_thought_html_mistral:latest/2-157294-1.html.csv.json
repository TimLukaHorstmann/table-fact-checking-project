Next, we look for the row in the table that corresponds to \"UEFA Super Cup\". The row index of this competition is 6 (indexes start from 0).\n\n3. Then, we find the column that contains the number of goals against for each competition. This column's header is \"goals against\" and it is the last column in the table.\n\n4. We read the value of the cell where the row index is 6 (UEFA Super Cup) and the column name is \"goals against\". In this case, the value for this cell is 3.\n\n5. With this information, we compare the goal against statistics of Nottingham Forest in the UEFA Super Cup to those of other competitions they have played in.\n\n6. To do so, we search the table for all rows (competitions) where the team is \"Nottingham Forest\". We find 4 such rows: European Cup, Uefa Cup, Inter - Cities Fairs Cup, and UEFA Super Cup.\n\n7. For each of these competitions, we look up the number of goals against in the \"goals against\" column. We obtain the following values: 12 (European Cup), 16 (Uefa Cup), 9 (Inter - Cities Fairs Cup).\n\n8.
