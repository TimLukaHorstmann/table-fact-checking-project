Once the row is found, check the \"speed\" column value in the found row to see if it matches the given speed (90.57 mph).\n4. If the value matches, the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\nThe final answer will be:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the rider whose speed needs to be checked.
