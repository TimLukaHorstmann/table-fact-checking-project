    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find all players who have more than 0 touchdowns (td 's) and more than 135 yards (yards).\n2. Inspect the table: Players with more than 0 touchdowns are rob turner, kevin ingram, and robert quiroga. Only players with more than 135 yards are kevin ingram and josh jeffries.\n3. Of these players, only two have an average (avg) recorded: kevin ingram (10.3) and josh jeffries (19.3).\n4. Compare the averages to see if any player has an average greater than 5.3. The only player with an average greater than 5.3 is josh jeffries (19.3 > 5.3).\n\n   Final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find players with more than 0 touchdowns and more than 135 yards, check their averages to see if any is greater than 5.3\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"td 's\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"yards\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"avg\"}\n  ]\n}",
