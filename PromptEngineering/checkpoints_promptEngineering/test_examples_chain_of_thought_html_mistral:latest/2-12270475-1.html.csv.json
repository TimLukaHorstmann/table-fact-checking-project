    "resp": "1. Identify the state in question: The claim mentions \"North Carolina\", so we will look for a row in the table where the \"state\" column matches \"north carolina\".\n\n2. Check the preliminaries score for North Carolina: We need to compare the claim's provided score (8.068) with the value in the \"preliminaries\" column for the identified row.\n\n3. Check the evening gown score for North Carolina: Similarly, we need to check if the claimed evening gown score (8.472) matches the value in the \"evening gown\" column for the identified row.\n\n4. Compare results with the claim: If both scores match their respective values in the table, then the claim is true. Otherwise, it is false.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the state in question\",\n    \"Check the preliminaries score for the identified state\",\n    \"Check the evening gown score for the identified state\",\n    \"Compare both scores with the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"preliminaries\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"evening gown\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
