The columns include details such as position, club name, number of games played, wins, draws, losses, points scored, points conceded, point difference, bonus points, and total points.\n  2. Identify the relevant club: To answer the given claim, we need to find the row that corresponds to Featherstone Rovers. In this table, the club name column (column 2) contains \"featherstone rovers\" in the 8th row.\n  3. Check the drawn games for the identified club: Once we have identified the relevant row, we can now check the value in the \"drawn\" column (column 4). In this case, for Featherstone Rovers, the value is 1.\n  4.

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps to answer the claim:\n\n1. Identify the team in question: The claim is about Leigh Centurions, so we need to find the row that corresponds to it in the table. In our table, the first column (position) of each row contains the position of the team. We can see that Leigh Centurions are at position 4.\n\n2. Check the number of losses for the team: The column that shows the number of losses is named \"lost\". We can see that in the fourth row, which corresponds to Leigh Centurions, the value in this column is 8.\n\n3. Check the total points scored by the team: The column that shows the total points scored by each team is named \"points\". In the fourth row, we can see that the value for Leigh Centurions is 34.\n\n4. Compare the values found in steps 2 and 3: If the number of losses (8) is equal to the total points lost (the opposite of the total points scored), then the claim would be true. In this case, the points scored by Leigh Centurions are 34, so the points lost would be 34 as well.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team in question\",\n    \"Check the number of losses for the team\",\n    \"Check the total points scored by the team\",\n    \"Compare the values found in steps 2 and 3\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"lost\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\" }\n  ]\n}",
