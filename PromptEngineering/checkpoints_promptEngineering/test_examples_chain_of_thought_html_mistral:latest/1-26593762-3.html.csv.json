From this information, we can see that Burnley's team is \"Burnley\".\n\n2. Check if the manager of Burnley (in the given time frame) left due to any reason. The relevant cell is at row 25 and column name \"Outgoing Manager\". From this information, we can see that Burnley's outgoing manager was Brian Law.\n\n3. Confirm if the departure of Brian Law caused a change in Burnley's position. The relevant cells are at row 25 and column name \"Position\" (before his departure) and row 26 and the same column name (after his departure). From this information, we can see that Burnley's position before Brian Law's departure was not specified, but after his departure, it is not given in the table. However, since there are only 40 rows in the table and all positions are listed up to row 39, we can infer that Burnley's position after Brian Law's departure is not shown in the table.\n\n4. As there is no specific information about Burnley's position after Brian Law's departure, we cannot definitively say whether or not they were still in 9th position. To find this out, we would need to know their final position in the table which is not given.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find the row for Burnley and confirm their manager at that time\", \"Check if the departure of the manager affected Burnley's position in the table, but since there is no specific information about Burnley's position after the departure, we cannot definitively say whether or not they were still in 9th position\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Outgoing Manager\"}\n  ]\n}",
