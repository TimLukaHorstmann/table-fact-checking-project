Find the relevant row: To verify this, we need to find the row in the table where the teams mentioned are Dartmouth and Princeton, as these are the only two teams associated with the Sawhorse dollar trophy.\n3. Check the number of games played: Once we have found the relevant row, we can check the \"games played\" column for the number of games played in this series. In the case of Dartmouth and Princeton, it is 90 games.\n4. Compare the claim with the table data: Comparing the claim with the table data shows that the number of games played (90) matches the claim exactly.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Find the relevant row in the table\", \"Check the number of games played\", \"Compare the claim with the table data\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"games played\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Identify the team that plays for the Sawhorse Dollar trophy from the table. In this case, it's Dartmouth and Princeton.\n2. Check if any of these teams have played more than 100 games in total. To find the number of games played, we look at the \"games played\" column for each row corresponding to Dartmouth and Princeton.\n3. Count the number of games for each team: For Dartmouth, there are 90 games as per the table, and for Princeton, there are also 90 games according to the table.\n4. Compare the total number of games played by both teams (180 games in total) with the threshold of more than 100 games: Since 180 is greater than 100, the claim is true.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify team playing for Sawhorse Dollar trophy\",\n    \"Check if total number of games played by these teams exceeds 100\",\n    \"Count number of games played by each team and compare with the threshold\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"games played\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"games played\" }\n  ]\n}",
