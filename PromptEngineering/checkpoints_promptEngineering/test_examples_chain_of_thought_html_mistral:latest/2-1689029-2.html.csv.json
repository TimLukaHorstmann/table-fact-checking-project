    "resp": "Here are the steps to analyze the claim:\n\n1. Identify the subject of the claim, which is the single release by INXS ahead of their album in 1980.\n2. Determine if there's any row in the table where the 'year' column value is 1980 and format is not \"single\". This will give us possible albums or collections (lp or mc) that were released before a single could potentially chart as the claim states.\n3. Search for rows in the table with a year of 1980, format other than 'single', and from Australia (as we're looking at their first Australian top 40 hit). This will help us find if INXS had an album release in Australia ahead of any single in 1980.\n4. If no such row is found, it means there was no album released by INXS in Australia before a single in 1980, and the claim cannot be confirmed or refuted with the provided data. However, since there are rows that match our criteria, we proceed to step 5.\n5. Check if any of the found albums have a 'top 40 hit' within the same year (in Australia). If yes, it means this could potentially be the first Australian top 40 hit for INXS in 1980, but more information is needed to confirm that it was a single ahead of the album.\n6. Check if any rows exist with the year as 1980, format as 'single', and country as Australia, before the album rows we found earlier. If yes, it means this could be their first Australian top 40 hit that came before the album release in 1980, confirming the claim.\n\nThe final answer will depend on the specific data in the table.

Among the LP entries, notice that only one row has a country as \"aus\" (Australia), which is where INXS originated from. However, there is no specific mention of \"deluxe records\" in this row. Therefore, we move on to the MC entries for Mercury Records.\n\n4. We find two MC rows: one for Europe and another for the USA. Neither of these mentions \"deluxe records.\"\n\n5.
