First, we need to understand what the claim states: The claim is that every entry in the table has a \"box score\" as its type for all games.\n\n2.

We will loop through the rows in the table and compare the values in the \"box score\" column with other columns to ensure that all games have a box score.\n\n4. If any game does not have a box score, then the claim is false; otherwise, if all games have a box score, the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's check each row:\n- Row 1: Townsville Crocodiles vs Sydney Spirit on 22 October at Townsville Entertainment Centre has a box score (103 - 101) in the table.\n- Row 2: Cairns Taipans vs New Zealand Breakers on 22 October at Cairns Convention Centre has a box score (101 - 92).\n- Row 3: Wollongong Hawks vs Gold Coast Blaze on 24 October at Win Entertainment Centre has a box score (98 - 96).\n- Row 4: Adelaide 36ers vs Perth Wildcats on 25 October at Distinctive Homes Dome has a box score (93 - 104).\n- Row 5: Gold Coast Blaze vs New Zealand Breakers on 25 October at Gold Coast Convention Centre has a box score (113 - 116).\n- Row 6: Melbourne Tigers vs Townsville Crocodiles on 25 October at State Netball and Hockey Centre has a box score (110 - 97).\n- Row 7: South Dragons vs Cairns Taipans on 25 October at Hisense Arena has a box score (94 - 65).\n- Row 8: Sydney Spirit vs Wollongong Hawks on 26 October at State Sports Centre has a box score (99 - 86).\n\nSince all games in the table have a box score, the claim is true.\n\nHere's the final answer as a JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Understand the claim\",\n    \"Examine the given table row by row\",\n    \"Check if all games have a 'box score'\",\n    \"If any game does not have a box score, then the claim is false; otherwise, if all games have a box score, the claim is true\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}",
