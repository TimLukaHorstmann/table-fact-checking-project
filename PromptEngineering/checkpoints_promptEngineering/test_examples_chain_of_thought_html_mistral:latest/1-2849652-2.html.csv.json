    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify all rows in the table that correspond to winter seasons. In our case, there are two such rows: gymnastics and swimming & diving.\n2. Check the number of divisions for each winter sport in the \"of divisions\" column. For gymnastics, it has 1 division, while swimming & diving has 2 divisions.\n3. Compare the number of divisions for each winter sport to the claim, which states that there should be one winter season with exactly 1 division.\n4. Based on our findings from steps 2 and 3, gymnastics meets the requirement for the claim as it has exactly 1 division in the winter season. However, swimming & diving does not meet the requirement as it has more than 1 division.\n5. Since there is only one row (gymnastics) that satisfies the condition for the claim, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE for this specific year (1978).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify winter seasons in the table\",\n    \"Check number of divisions for each winter sport\",\n    \"Compare the number of divisions to the claim's requirement\",\n    \"Find the relevant row(s) that meet the condition\",\n    \"Conclude based on the number of matching rows\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"winter\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"of divisions\" }\n  ]\n}",

In this case, it's Winter season and we want to find out about the state tournament location for a specific sport, but no particular sport is mentioned in the claim. However, since we have multiple entries for winter sports in the table, we can iterate through them.\n2. Loop through the rows of the table that correspond to the winter season. In this case, there are 3 such rows (gymnastics, swimming and diving, bowling).\n3. For each row, check if the year specified in the claim (2011-2012) matches with the 5th column of the table (1977 for gymnastics, swimming and diving, 2007 for bowling). Since the claim's year does not match any of the years listed, we can eliminate those sports.\n4. If no sport matches the claim's year, then the claim is FALSE as there is no winter season state tournament location for that specific year.\n5. In case a sport matches the claim's year, check if the state tournament location for that sport in the 6th column of the table (column \"2011 - 2012 state tournament location\") is \"crew stadium, columbus\".
