    "resp": "Here is the reasoning process:\n\n1. First, identify the date for which the game on May 24 is being checked. In this case, we can see that there is a row where the \"date\" column has the value \"may 24\".\n\n2. Second, check the \"home\" column for the same row to determine who the home team was. If it's \"chicago\", then the claim may be true. In this case, the \"home\" column does indeed have the value \"chicago\".\n\n3. Third, check the \"decision\" column for the same row to verify that the decider was Conklin. However, in this table, there is no \"decision\" column for the row corresponding to May 24. This means we cannot definitively say whether the decider was Conklin or not.\n\nTherefore, the claim cannot be conclusively verified as it lacks enough information.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the row for May 24.
