Each row represents a single match between two teams, and there are several columns that indicate the scores for each set.\n2. To determine if a match went to 5 sets, we need to check if a row has scores for all 5 sets (S1, S2, S3, S4, S5). If a row has scores in all 5 sets, then it means that the match went to 5 sets.\n3. We should note that any missing score or \"x\" value indicates an unplayed set or a default win for one team. A default win doesn't mean the match didn't go to 5 sets; instead, it implies one of the teams won without playing all the sets.\n4. To find the relevant cells for our analysis, we need to focus on the rows with scores in the S1-S5 columns and ignore any rows with a default win (indicated by an 'x').\n5. After examining the table, we will identify if there is at least one row where scores are provided in all 5 sets (S1-S5). If such a row exists, then the match on Jun 8 indeed went to 5 sets.
