    "resp": "1. First, identify the rows where the `place` column is 1 (since the claim states \"tie for 1st place\"). In this table, there are no such rows.\n2. Second, since the claim also specifies that all tied players come from the United States, we need to find out if any of the players in the table do indeed come from the United States. All players in the table except Arnold Palmer are from the United States (as indicated by the `country` column).\n3. Third, since there are no rows with a place of 1 and all tied players are from the United States, we cannot confirm the claim that \"4 player be tie for 1st place and all come from the united state\". However, it is important to note that the table only provides data up to place 8. There could be more players tied for 1st place beyond the rows provided in the table.\n\nHere's the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify rows where place = 1, find players from United States, and verify if all tied players are from United States\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\nThis answer indicates that the claim is FALSE because there are no rows with a place of 1 (which would indicate a tie for 1st place), and the table only provides data up to place 8. It is possible that more players tied for 1st place beyond the rows provided in the table, but since the table does not show this information, we cannot confirm the claim with certainty based on the available data.",

The relevant cells for this step are:\n    - row_index: 6 (since Arnold Palmer's row index is 6)\n    - column_name: \"player\"\n\n2. Check the score of Arnold Palmer to determine if he is even par. To calculate the score, we need to find the sum of his two-round scores which is located in the \"score\" column for each player and then compare it with 144 (even par). The relevant cells for this step are:\n    - row_index: 6\n    - column_name: \"score\"\n\n3. Compare the total score of Arnold Palmer with even par (144 in this case since par is usually 72 for 18 holes, but here it seems to be 70 for each round).
