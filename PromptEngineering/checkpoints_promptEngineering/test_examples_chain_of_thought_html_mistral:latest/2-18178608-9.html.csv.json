Examine the 'status' column for each of these rows to determine if they refer to test matches against England. Rows 5, 6, and 8 represent the first, second, and third test matches with Australia vs. England, respectively. However, row 9 represents a test match between Australia and Ireland at Twickenham, which is not relevant for this claim.\n4. For each of the test matches against England (rows 5, 6, and 8), check the 'score' column to determine the points scored by Australia. Rows 5 and 6 represent the first and second tests, respectively. In row 5, Australia scores 22 points; in row 6, Australia scores 28 points.\n5. Compare the scores obtained from step 4 to determine which test match had the highest score (second test) and the second-highest score (first test). The second test has the higher score (28), and the first test has the second-highest score (22).\n6.
