Determine if the Rockies were at 64-70 after this match: It is not specified in the table whether the Rockies are the team in question, but since we don't have enough information to identify another team named Rockies with a record of 64-70, it's reasonable to assume that the Rockies are the team in question. After Remlinger took the loss on August 27, their record would be updated as follows:\n   - Wins: 64 + (assuming they won other games between 7/31 and 8/27) = X (let's say X > 0 to ensure that the Rockies have more than 70 wins in total)\n   - Losses: 70 + 1 (the loss taken by Remlinger on 8/27) = 71\n   So, their new record would be X-71, which is not equal to 64-70.\n\nHowever, since we cannot determine the exact number of wins for the Rockies between 7/31 and 8/27, it's impossible to definitively say whether they went to 64-70 after August 27.
