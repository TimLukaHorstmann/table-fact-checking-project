I will examine each row of the table and compare the opponent column with \"Chicago bears\" and the game site column with \"soldier field\".\n3. Since rows are sorted by game date, I start from the beginning (row 10) and move downwards.\n4. On row 10, I find that the opponent was the Chicago Bears and the game site was soldier field.\n5. Finally, I compare the result column in this row with the given claim \"31 - 29\".\n6. The score in the table for that game is indeed \"31 - 29\", which matches the claim.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check the opponent and game site for each row.\",\n    \"Start from the beginning of the table (row 10) since the rows are sorted by date.\",\n    \"Find the row where the opponent is 'Chicago Bears' and the game site is 'soldier field'.\",\n    \"Compare the result in the table for that game with the given claim.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"game site\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "1. Identify the key information from the claim: The claim states that we are interested in the result of a game played at Soldier Field after week 10.\n  2. Find the row corresponding to the game played at Soldier Field: In the table, we can see that there is only one game played at Soldier Field, which is between Seattle Seahawks and Chicago Bears on November 5th (row 10).\n  3. Verify if this game was played after week 10: To check if this game was played after week 10, we need to compare the date with the weeks in the table. In our table, each row represents a game from the season, and week 10 is on November 5th (row 10). Since the game at Soldier Field was on November 5th, it was played after week 10.\n  4. Verify the result of the game: Finally, we need to check if the result of the game matches with \"w 31 - 29\". In row 10, the result is \"w 31 - 29\".\n\nNow, let's output the final answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the key information from the claim: The game played at Soldier Field after week 10.\",\n    \"Find the row corresponding to the game played at Soldier Field: The only game played at Soldier Field is in row 10.\",\n    \"Verify if this game was played after week 10: Compare the date of the game with weeks in the table.
