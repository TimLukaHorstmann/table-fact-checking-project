Next, iterate through each row in the table, starting from the first one (row_index=0) and moving down to the last row (row_index=11).\n3. For each row, parse the value in the \"televote / sms\" column to determine if it's a double-digit number. To do this, check if the integer part of the number is greater than or equal to 10 (e.g., 10.5 is considered a double-digit number).\n4. If at any point during this iteration, you find a row where the value in the \"televote / sms\" column is a double-digit number, then the claim is TRUE. If, after iterating through all rows, no such double-digit percentage is found, then the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's examine the relevant cells:\n\n1. { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\" } (2.95%)\n2. { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\" } (0.37%)\n3. { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\" } (11.74%) <-- Relevant cell for the claim\n4. { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\" } (2.39%)\n5. { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\" } (2.53%)\n6. { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\" } (2.03%)\n7. { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\" } (3.91%)\n8. { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\" } (3.20%)\n9. { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\" } (8.45%)\n10. { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\" } (2.03%)\n11. { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\" } (1.16%)\n12. { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\" } (55.52%) <-- Second relevant cell for the claim\n\nNow let's output the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Iterate through each row in the table and check if the value in the 'televote / sms' column is a double-digit number.
