Count the number of American golfers among the top 5: There are 4 American golfers out of the top 5.\n\n4. Compare the result with the claim: If the claim stated that \"2 or more\" of the top 5 golfer in the 1995 PGA Tour were not American, then the claim would be true since there are 2 non-American golfers (Greg Norman and Nick Price).

In this case, Tom Kite does have 2 more wins than Greg Norman.\n3. Compare the earnings (earnings column) for Greg Norman and Tom Kite. From the table, Greg Norman has earnings of $9,592,829 while Tom Kite has earnings of $9,337,998.\n4. Determine if Greg Norman earns almost 300,000 more than Tom Kite as stated in the claim.

Understand the data: The table provides earnings for golfers but does not specify the year. However, we can assume that this is a historical table and the players listed are from previous years, including 1995.\n\n3. Check the top 5 winners by earnings (as this is what the claim refers to as \"the top 5\"):\n   - Rank 1: Greg Norman - Earnings: 9592829 USD\n   - Rank 2: Tom Kite - Earnings: 9337998 USD\n   - Rank 3: Payne Stewart - Earnings: 7389479 USD\n   - Rank 4: Nick Price - Earnings: 7338119 USD\n   - Rank 5: Fred Couples - Earnings: 7188408 USD\n\n4. Compare the earnings of the top 5 winners with the claim's condition (over 7 million dollars):\n   - Greg Norman, Tom Kite, and Tom Kite all have earnings over 7 million dollars.\n   - Payne Stewart has earnings of 7389479 USD, which is slightly under 7 million dollars but still close.\n   - Fred Couples has earnings of 7188408 USD, which is well below 7 million dollars.\n\n5. Conclusion: Based on the data provided in the table, it can be seen that Greg Norman and Tom Kite meet the condition specified in the claim. However, Payne Stewart's earnings are very close to 7 million dollars but slightly under, while Fred Couples does not meet the condition. Since the claim refers to all top 5 winners and only two of them (Greg Norman and Tom Kite) meet the condition, the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Understand the data\", \"Check the top 5 winners by earnings\", \"Compare the earnings with the claim's condition\", \"Conclusion\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"earnings\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"earnings\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"earnings\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"earnings\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"earnings\" }\n  ]\n}",
