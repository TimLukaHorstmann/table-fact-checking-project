Determine if there are any other candidates who have both received loans and had a lower money raised, 2q:\n   - Since there is no data for Mike Gravel's money raised, 2q, it's impossible to check if someone else has a loan and less money raised, 2q.\n\n5. Consider the overall claim:\n   - The claim states that only Mike Gravel received a loan of 10000 with the least amount raised, 2q.
