The columns include match number, date, competition or tour, ground (A for home, n for neutral), opponent, and score1 which is the score of Team A in each match.\n\n2. We are asked whether any two matches took place in 2007.

Looking at the table, we can see that match 5 on 24 Apr 2007 and match 6 on 20 Jun 2007 took place in 2007.
