Compare the claim with the table contents to find the row where the 'year', 'city', and 'partner' match the values provided in the claim (2002, san diego, ai sugiyama).\n\n2. If a matching row is found, then compare the 'score' column value of that row with the score provided in the claim.\n\n3. If both conditions are met (matching row found and score matches), then the claim is true. Otherwise, it is false.\n\n   After checking the table, we find a matching row for the given values:\n\n   - The 'year' value matches: 2002\n   - The 'city' value matches: san diego\n   - The 'partner' value matches: ai sugiyama\n\n4. Compare the score provided in the table with the score provided in the claim.\n\n5.
