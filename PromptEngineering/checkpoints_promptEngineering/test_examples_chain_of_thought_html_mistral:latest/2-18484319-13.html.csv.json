    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. First, we need to find out the number of away games played by Pohang Steelers throughout the table. To do so, we look for rows where the home team is \"Pohang Steelers\" and compare it with the total number of rounds in the table (6 rounds).\n2. Next, we search for each occurrence of Pohang Steelers as an away team by looking for the rows where the home team column has a value other than Pohang Steelers. In this table, there are 4 such occurrences: Rounds 1, 3, 5, and 6.\n3. Now that we have identified all the rounds in which Pohang Steelers played as an away team, we can check if round 5 is indeed the last occurrence of them playing as an away team. Comparing our findings from step 2, Round 5 (row index 4) is followed by a row where the home team is once again Pohang Steelers (row index 5).\n4. Based on our findings in step 3, we can conclude that round 5 is not the last away game played by the Pohang Steelers.\n\nNow let's present the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find all the rounds where Pohang Steelers are an away team\", \"Check if round 5 is the last occurrence of Pohang Steelers as an away team\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
