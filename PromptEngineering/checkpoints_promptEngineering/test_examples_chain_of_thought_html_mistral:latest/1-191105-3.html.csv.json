    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the episodes related to the skeletal system from the table. From the 'subject' column, we can see that there are two episodes related to the skeletal system - \"them not - so - dry bones\" and \"interplanet janet\".\n\n2. Next, we need to find out when each of these episodes was first aired. By looking at the 'first aired' column, we can see that \"them not - so - dry bones\" was first aired in 1979 and \"interplanet janet\" was first aired in 1978.\n\n3. Finally, since our claim is about the episode related to the skeletal system being first aired in 1979, we compare the years of first airing for both episodes. The only episode among them that was first aired in 1979 is \"them not - so - dry bones\".\n\nNow, let's present the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify episodes related to skeletal system\",\n    \"Find years of first airing for each episode\",\n    \"Compare years and choose the one that matches our claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"first aired\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"first aired\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
