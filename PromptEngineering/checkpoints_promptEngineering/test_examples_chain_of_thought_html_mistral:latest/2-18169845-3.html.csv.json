Count the number of awards won by each cast member, by identifying all rows where the 'nominee' column matches the name of the cast member and the 'result' column indicates a win. In our table, Bebe Neuwirth is listed as having won an award, but Nathan Lane is not.\n5. Compare the number of awards nominated for each cast member and consider whether one cast member was nominated for more awards than any other cast member. In this case, both Nathan Lane and Bebe Neuwirth were nominated for multiple awards, so neither has been nominated for more awards than the other. However, when comparing the number of nominations for the show as a whole versus those for each individual cast member, we see that the show as a whole was nominated for more awards (distinguished production, outstanding set design, etc.) than any individual cast member.\n6. Based on the above analysis, the claim can be determined to be FALSE. The Addams Family musical's cast members were not nominated for more awards than any other cast member.\n\n   Here is my final output in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the show\",\n    \"Determine who the cast members are\",\n    \"Count the number of awards nominated for each cast member\",\n    \"Count the number of awards won by each cast member\",\n    \"Compare the number of awards nominated for each cast member\",\n    \"Consider whether one cast member was nominated for more awards than any other cast member\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominee\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nominee\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"category\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
