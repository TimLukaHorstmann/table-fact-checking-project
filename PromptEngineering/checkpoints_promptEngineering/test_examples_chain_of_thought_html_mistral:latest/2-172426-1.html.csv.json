Check the column 'name dates' for the corresponding cell (row_index=7, column_name='name dates') to confirm that it refers to Anne and the current monarch, Elizabeth II. The name dates suggest they are mother and daughter, so this step verifies that.\n3. To find out how many husbands Anne has had, we need to look at the 'husband dates' column for her row. If a person is still married, it would mean they have another husband after the currently recorded one in the table. Since there is no date beyond 1992 for Anne, it implies that she doesn't have another husband after Mark Phillips (row_index=7, column_name='husband dates').\n4. However, the claim states that Anne has \"2 husbands\". We notice another row with Anne's name and the same 'name dates', but it seems there is a typo as the 'husband dates' for this row include Sir Timothy Laurence (row_index=7, column_name='husband dates').

If there is another marriage date after the first one, it indicates remarriage and not divorce. If there is no subsequent marriage date, then this could be a possible case of divorce.\n4. Check if any princess has multiple rows, as having more than one row for a princess might also indicate divorce or a new marriage. In this case, all princesses have only one row each, so we can assume that the absence of a second marriage date indicates a lifelong union rather than a divorce and remarriage.\n5. Based on the analysis in steps 2-4, look for any instances where there is no subsequent marriage date, and only one row per princess. This would suggest a potential case of divorce if the husband's death precedes the current year (indicated by \"-\" or a future year).\n6.

Check if the person Louise got married to was Edward VII at any point in his lifetime: To do this, we can compare Edward VII's lifespan (1841 - 1910) with the date when Louise got married (1889). Since Edward VII was alive during that time, it can be concluded that he is the husband of Louise at that point.\n6.
