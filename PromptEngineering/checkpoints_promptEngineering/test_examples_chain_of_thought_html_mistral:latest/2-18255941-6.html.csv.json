The claim states that the quarter-final, semi-final, and final all have a draw date on March 18, 2011.\n\n2. Search for rows where the phase is \"quarter - finals\", \"semi - finals\", or \"final\": In the table, we see three rows with the phase column as \"quarter - finals\", \"semi - finals\", and \"final\". Their row indices are 8, 9, and 10 respectively.\n\n3. Examine the draw date for each of these rows: The draw dates for these rows are in the 3rd column (draw_date). Rows with index 8 and 9 have a draw date of \"18 march 2011\", while row 10 has the value \"18 march 2011 at wembley stadium, london\". Since the first part of the value corresponds to the required date, we can say that the values in rows 8 and 9 match the claim.\n\n4. Check if there are any discrepancies: In our analysis so far, we found that two out of three rows (8 and 9) have a draw date on March 18, 2011 as specified in the claim.

    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the phase where the draw date for August 26, 2010 occurs, as this is the key to finding the relevant rounds for comparison. In this case, it appears in the 'group stage' phase.\n\n2. Next, we need to check if there are more than 6 rows with the 'phase' set to 'group stage'. We can do this by visually scanning the table or by counting the number of rows where the 'phase' value is 'group stage'.\n\n3. In this case, there are 6 rows for the 'group stage', but we must ensure that these rounds are also associated with August 26, 2010. Since all six rows have the same draw date as our target date, they represent potential candidates for the comparison.\n\n4. To verify if any of these rows are rounds within a matchday, we should compare the 'round' values in each row with the ones that have the 'phase' set to 'qualifying' or 'knockout phase', where it's clear from the table structure that those rounds are part of a specific matchday.\n\n5. By comparing the round values, we can see that some rows share identical 'round' names (e.g., matchday 1 and matchday 2) with rows in the 'qualifying' or 'knockout phase', indicating that they could be related to the same competition stage. For example, matchday 1 from the 'group stage' shares its name with round 1 of the 'knockout phase', suggesting a possible connection between the two stages.\n\n6. Since the claim asks for more than 6 rounds associated with August 26, 2010, we should consider not only matchdays 1-6 but also any additional rows that have round names that share commonalities with other phases (e.g., round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, final).\n\n7. Upon further examination, it appears that the 'round' values in the 'knockout phase' section can be traced back to matchdays within their respective stages (e.g., round of 16 corresponds to matchday 1 for the round of 16, quarter-finals correspond to matchday 2 for the quarter-finals, and so on).\n\n8. Based on our analysis, there are more than 6 rounds associated with August 26, 2010, as we can consider multiple matches within the knockout phase (round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, final) in addition to the 6 matchdays from the 'group stage'.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the phase with the target draw date\",\n    \"Check if there are more than 6 rows for that phase\",\n    \"Compare round values to determine if they belong to the same competition stage\",\n    \"Consider additional rounds within the knockout phase\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"phase\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"phase\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"phase\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"phase\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"phase\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"phase\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"phase\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"phase\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"phase\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"phase\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"phase\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"phase\" }\n  ]\n}",

The claim states that the knockout stage has the most rounds, all of which have a draw date in August 2010 or March 2011.\n\n2. Next, we need to identify the stages from the table and count the number of rounds for each stage.\n   - Qualifying has 3 rounds (first, second, third qualifying round) and play-off has 1 round (play-off round).\n   - The group stage has 6 rounds (matchday 1 to matchday 6).\n   - The knockout phase consists of the round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and final. This makes a total of 4 rounds in the knockout phase.\n\n3. Now, we need to check if all the rounds in the knockout phase have a draw date in August 2010 or March 2011.\n   - The round of 16 has a draw date on 17 December 2010 (which is not in the specified dates). However, the first leg of this round is in February and March 2011, which falls within the specified dates.\n   - The quarter-finals have a draw date on 18 March 2011.\n   - The semi-finals also have a draw date on 18 March 2011.\n   - The final has a draw date on 18 March 2011.\n\n4. Since the first leg of the round of 16 and all other rounds in the knockout phase (quarter-finals, semi-finals, and final) have their draws in August 2010 or March 2011, the claim partially holds true. However, the claim states that all rounds in the knockout stage have a draw date in August 2010 or March 2011, which is not entirely accurate because the round of 16 has its first leg dates in February and March 2011, but not its draw date.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Understand claim: knockout stage has most rounds with a draw date in August 2010 or March 2011\", \"Count number of rounds for each stage\", \"Check if all knockout phase rounds have a draw date in specified months\", \"Analyze the results and make a conclusion\"],\n  \"answer\": \"PARTLY TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"stage\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"stage\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 57, \"column_name\": \"stage\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 68, \"column_name\": \"stage\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"draw date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"draw date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 42, \"column_name\": \"draw date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 58, \"column_name\": \"draw date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
