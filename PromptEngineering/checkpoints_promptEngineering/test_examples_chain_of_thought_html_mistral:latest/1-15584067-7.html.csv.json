The column names indicate that the table shows information about different episodes of a TV show.\n\n2. Find out who wrote each episode: Next, we look for patterns in the \"Directed by\" column to find out who wrote each episode. In this table, it appears that the column labeled \"Directed by\" represents the writer of each episode, as the directors' names match with the writers' names in several rows (e.g., Kenny Smith directed and wrote episodes 99, 102, 104, and 106).\n\n3. Check for episodes in season 11: To determine if Kenny Smith wrote everything before season 11, we need to find out which episodes are from season 11. From the table, there is no clear indication of seasons, but we can look for a pattern based on episode numbers or air dates. In this case, the episode numbers suggest that episodes 101, 103, and 105 might be in season 11 since they are consecutive and not part of any previous patterns.\n\n4. Find all episodes written by Kenny Smith: Now, we collect all the episodes written by Kenny Smith to check if he wrote everything before season 11. In this table, we find that Kenny Smith directed and wrote episodes 99 (row index 20), 102 (row index 23), 104 (row index 26), and 106 (row index 29).\n\n5. Check if all written episodes are before season 11: Finally, we compare the list of episodes written by Kenny Smith with the potential episodes in season 11. In this case, none of the episodes written by Kenny Smith are included in the possible season 11 episodes (99, 102, 104, and 106), which means that he did write everything before season 11.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify episodes in table\", \"Find who wrote each episode based on 'Directed by' column\", \"Check for episodes in season 11\", \"Find all episodes written by Kenny Smith\", \"Compare the list of written episodes with the potential season 11 episodes\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"}\n  ]\n}",
