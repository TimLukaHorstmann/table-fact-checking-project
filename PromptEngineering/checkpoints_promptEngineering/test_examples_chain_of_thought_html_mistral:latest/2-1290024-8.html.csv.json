In this case, since all the matching rows have the same withdrawal duration (\"1958 - 1963\"), we don't need to determine which one is the longest, as they are all equal.\n\n5. Finally, compare these durations with other locomotives in the table.

Compare the duration of time spent in service for each locomotive of this class. In our example, both locomotives were withdrawn from 1910 to 1960.
