    "resp": "1. Identify the player who played in Nalchik with 4 (a team event) and check their classification. In the table, we see that Ruslan Ponomariov participated in Nalchik with a team but there's no individual classification provided for him.\n2. Since we cannot find Ruslan's individual classification directly from the given information, we need to determine if his Jermuk classification (a qualification event) is less than 140.\n3. Check Ruslan Ponomariov's Jermuk classification by searching for his row in the table and looking at the \"Jermuk\" column. Unfortunately, Ruslan does not have a Jermuk classification as he did not participate in that specific event.\n4. Since we cannot compare Ruslan's Jermuk score to 140, we need to find another player who participated both in Nalchik with 4 and the qualification event (Jermuk) and compare their scores.\n5. Looking at the table, we can see that Magnus Carlsen participated in both events but withdrew from Jermuk before the competition started.\n6. Since we cannot compare a withdrawn score with a specific value, we should find another player who participated in both Nalchik and Jermuk and has scores available for comparison.\n7. We find Ian Cheparinov who also played in both events but his Jermuk score (10) is greater than 140. No other players meet the criteria of participating in both events with available scores.\n8. Since we cannot find a player who participated in both events and has a Jermuk score less than 140, it is not possible to verify the claim that \"the Nalchik with 4 played , a rl qual , and 100 jermuk be less than 140\".\n\nIn summary:\n- We cannot find a player who participated in both events (Nalchik and Jermuk) and has scores available for comparison.\n- Therefore, we cannot verify the claim that \"the Nalchik with 4 played , a rl qual , and 100 jermuk be less than 140\".\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify player who participated in Nalchik with 4, check individual classification. \\nFind the Jermuk score of the identified player. \\nCompare the Jermuk score to 140. \\nIf not possible, find another player who played both events and compare their scores.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"UNKNOWN\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 37, \"column_name\": \"Nalchik\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Jermuk\"}\n  ]\n}",
