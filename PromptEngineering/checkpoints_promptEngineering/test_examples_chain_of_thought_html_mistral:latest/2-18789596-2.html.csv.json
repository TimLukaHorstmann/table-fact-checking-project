Find the relevant rows: To answer the claim, we need to find the rows corresponding to Russia (russia) and Spain (spain).\n\n3. Compare the scores: For each pair of athletes from Russia and Spain, compare their total points (which is a sum of technical and free points).

Compare their scores to determine which one is lower: In this case, Japan's total score (97.167) is higher than China's total score (96.334).\n\n4.
