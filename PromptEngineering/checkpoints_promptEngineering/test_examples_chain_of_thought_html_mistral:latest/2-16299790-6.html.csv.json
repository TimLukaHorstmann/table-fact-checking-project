    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the player we are interested in, which is Tiger Woods.\n2. Find Tiger Wood's row in the table to get his place, country, score, and to par values.\n3. Tiger Woods' score is 205 (calculated as 67 + 68 + 70).\n4. Check if there are any players with a lower score than Tiger Woods.\n5. Scan the table from top to bottom, comparing scores and finding no player with a lower score.\n6. Since no one has a lower score, we know that Tiger Woods' score places him 1st because he has the lowest score in the table.\n7. However, the claim asks for the placement of Tiger Woods as being 5th, which is incorrect according to our analysis so far.\n8. We must now consider the \"to par\" column as part of the scoring system to determine if Tiger's actual placement was lower than first due to better performance relative to par.\n9. In this tournament, players are playing four rounds and aiming for a score that is under par (below 280) to perform well.\n10. A score of \"-5\" means Tiger Woods finished the tournament at 4 shots under par (276), which is an excellent performance.\n11. Since Tiger Woods has the lowest score and is under par, his placement must be lower than first in the table to account for his superior play relative to par.\n12. We go back to our initial scan of the table and observe that there are ties at 3rd place with scores of 210. The \"to par\" values for these players are \"e\", which means they finished the tournament at even par (280).\n13. Tiger Woods' score is lower than the tied 3rd-place players, and his superior play relative to par (-5) makes him outperform those players.\n14. Therefore, Tiger Woods' placement in this tournament is between 1st and 3rd place, but closer to 1st due to his excellent performance relative to par, making the claim \"tiger woods score a 211 placing 5th\" FALSE.\n\nThe final answer will be:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the player we are interested in\",\n    \"Find Tiger Wood's row in the table to get his place, country, score, and to par values\",\n    \"Tiger Woods' score is 205 (calculated as 67 + 68 + 70)\",\n    \"Scan the table from top to bottom, comparing scores and finding no player with a lower score\",\n    \"Since no one has a lower score, we know that Tiger Woods' score places him 1st\",\n    \"Check if there are any players who have better performance relative to par than Tiger Woods\",\n    \"Consider the 'to par' column as part of the scoring system to determine if Tiger's actual placement was lower than first due to better performance relative to par\",\n    \"Scan the table again and observe that there are ties at 3rd place with scores of 210, but their 'to par' values are 'e'\",\n    \"Tiger Woods' score is lower than the tied 3rd-place players, and his superior performance relative to par (-5) makes him outperform those players\",\n    \"Therefore, Tiger Woods' placement in this tournament is between 1st and 3rd place, but closer to 1st due to his excellent performance relative to par\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"Player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"Score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"Score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"to par\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
