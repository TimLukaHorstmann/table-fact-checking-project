In this case, there are 7 different sports: m golf, volleyball, w soccer, football, m cross country, w cross country, w basketball, w swimming, m basketball, wrestling, w gymnastics, w gymnastics, softball.\n\n2. Sort the sports by their earliest date of occurrence. To do this, we need to find the row with the smallest 'date' value for each sport and record its date (and the fact that it is indeed the earliest date for that sport). In this table, volleyball was played on September 8, 2007.\n\n3. Compare the sorted dates of all sports to find the second earliest date. In our case, there are multiple dates tied for the second earliest: September 4, 2007 (m golf) and December 5, 2007 (w basketball). However, the claim asks for the \"second earliest date for volleyball,\" so we only need to consider the earliest date for other sports after volleyball.\n\n4. Check if any sport had an earlier date than September 8, 2007, which is the date of the first occurrence of volleyball. In this table, there are no such instances, meaning that volleyball indeed has the second earliest date among all sports in the table.\n\nFinally, the output will be:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"List the sports present in the table.\",\n    \"Sort the sports by their earliest occurrence date.\",\n    \"Find the earliest and second earliest dates for each sport.\",\n    \"Compare the sorted dates to determine if volleyball has the second earliest date\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\" }\n  ]\n}",
