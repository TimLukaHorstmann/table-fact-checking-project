Check for a row with \"year\" equal to 1998 as it is the year immediately preceding the claimed year (1999). This will help us determine if there are any players who might have been the runner-up in the previous year.\n3. Examine the 'champion' and 'runner - up' columns for the row with \"year\" equal to 1998. If either of these matches the claimed runner-up (karina hab\u0161udov\u00e1), then the claim is FALSE, as she was the runner-up in that year.\n4. Check for a row with \"year\" equal to 1999. Examine the 'runner - up' column for this row. If the value matches 'karina hab\u0161udov\u00e1', then the claim is TRUE.\n5.
