From the table, there is only one row that matches this condition, and it is the fourth row (year 1960).\n3. Identify the number of stages for the year where the distance was exactly 1648 km: In the identified row, look at the \"stages\" column to find the number of stages. In this case, it is 9.\n4. Compare the claim with the result from step 3: Since the number of stages (9) does not match the claim (12), we cannot conclude that a distance of 1648 km takes 12 stages to achieve.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Determine which rows correspond to the years where the distance was exactly 1648 km\",\n    \"Identify the number of stages for the year where the distance was exactly 1648 km\",\n    \"Compare the claim with the result from step 3\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"distance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"stages\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Find the relevant data: In the table, we are looking for the row(s) where the stages column is equal to 8 and the year column is 1967 or any other year.\n\n3. Analyze the results: If we find a row where both conditions are met (stages = 8 and year = 1967), it means that stage 8 was indeed only reached in the year 1967, thus making the claim TRUE. If we find a row where stages = 8 in any other year than 1967, it would mean that the claim is FALSE.\n\n4. Examine the table: After examining the table, we find that there is only one row where the stages column equals 8 and the year column equals 1967.
