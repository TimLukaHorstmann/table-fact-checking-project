Identify the two matches we need to compare: one between Bate Borisov and Anderlecht, and the other between Bate Borisov and Levski Sofia.\n2. Find the rows in the table that correspond to these matches. The row for the match against Anderlecht is at row index 7 (since the first row is a header), and the row for the match against Levski Sofia is at row index 10.\n3. Check the relevant columns in each row. For the match against Anderlecht, we need to look at the column named \"team 2\" as this is the team that Bate Borisov played against, and the column named \"agg\". For the match against Levski Sofia, we need to look at the same two columns, but for a different row.\n4. Compare the values in these cells. The value in the \"team 2\" column for Anderlecht is \"anderlecht\", and the corresponding value for Levski Sofia is \"levski sofia\". The value in the \"agg\" column for Anderlecht is \"3 - 4\", and the corresponding value for Levski Sofia is \"1 - 2\".\n5. Determine whether Bate Borisov scored 2 goals more against Anderlecht compared to Levski Sofia. To do this, we convert the scores into integers by ignoring the \"-\" symbols and spaces, then compare these numbers. The score for Anderlecht is \"34\", and the score for Levski Sofia is \"12\". Since 34 > 12, Bate Borisov scored more goals against Anderlecht than against Levski Sofia.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the two matches to compare, find the rows in the table that correspond to these matches, check the relevant columns for each match and compare the values\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}, {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"}, {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}]\n}",

Compare the goals scored by the identified team (Shakhtyor Soligorsk): To check if Shakhtyor Soligorsk scored 5 goals in total, we look at both legs of their match. In the first leg, they scored 1 goal and in the second leg they conceded 3 goals without scoring any. Therefore, Shakhtyor Soligorsk scored a total of 1 + 0 = 1 goal.\n\n5. Compare the highest goal tally in the identified round: We need to look at other teams' goal tallies from the first round.
