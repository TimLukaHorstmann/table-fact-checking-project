Next, I look for a row in the table that matches the required venue, which is 'karachi'.\n3. From the table, I find the row with index 4 that corresponds to the venue 'karachi'.\n4. In this row, I check if the battling partners match the ones mentioned in the claim (mahela jayawardene and thilan samaraweera). The batting partners listed are indeed mahela jayawardene and thilan samaraweera.\n5. Finally, I verify that the runs given in the row match the runs mentioned in the claim.

    "resp": "Here is my reasoning process:\n1. First, I identify the claim to be checked, which is \"mahela jayawardene and thilan samaraweera have 195 runs together, in karachi\".\n2. Next, I scan the table to find rows where the batting partners match the given pair (mahela jayawardene and thilan samaraweera). The relevant row is the 4th row.\n3. In the column \"runs\" of this row, there is a value of 437 runs which is not equal to the claimed value of 195 runs.\n4. I then check if both players have batted together in any other venues (by checking all the rows in the table where one of the batting partners is mahela jayawardene or thilan samaraweera). The only match I find is the row with mahela jayawardene and prasanna jayawardene, but this row does not have \"karachi\" as the venue.\n5. Finally, since the claimed value of runs (195) is not found for the given pair in any of the rows, and no other match is found between the two players in any venue, I conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim to be checked.\",\n    \"Scan the table to find relevant rows.\",\n    \"Check if runs column matches the claimed value for the given pair in the found row.\",\n    \"Check if both players have batted together in any other venues.\",\n    \"Conclude based on findings.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"runs\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is true or false:\n\n1. First, identify the row in the table that corresponds to the year 1997 according to the 'season' column. In our case, it is the second row with 'season': '1997'.\n2. Next, check the 'battling partners' column for this row. If the values of the 'battling partners' column for the 1997 row are distinct individuals, then the claim that \"in 1997, roshan mahanama and sanath jayasuira do not battle\" would be true because they did not bat together in the same match.\n3. Inspect the 'battling partners' column for the 1997 row: The values are \"roshan mahanama\" and \"sanath jayasuriya\". These two names appear to belong to different individuals, so they do not battle in this case.\n\nNow let us provide our final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row corresponding to '1997' based on the 'season' column\",\n    \"Check the 'battling partners' column for the 1997 row\",\n    \"Determine if the batting partners in the 1997 row are distinct individuals\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"battling partners\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
