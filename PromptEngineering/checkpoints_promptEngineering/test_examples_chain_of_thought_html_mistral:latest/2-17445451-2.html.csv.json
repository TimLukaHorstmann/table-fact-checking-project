    "resp": "1. Identify the claim: The claim states that there is a match where the opponent's name is \"cleber luciano\" and the time is last (implying it is the latest recorded event).\n\n2. Locate the relevant rows: Search through the table for rows where the 'opponent' column matches \"cleber luciano\".\n\n3. Compare times: Once we have found a row with the opponent named \"cleber luciano\", compare its time to other records. Since the claim implies that it is the latest recorded event, it should be the row with the greatest value in the 'time' column.\n\n4. Verify consistency: Ensure that there are no other rows where the 'opponent' and 'time' values meet or exceed the ones from step 3, as this would contradict the claim of it being the latest event.\n\n5. Final answer: If all steps above are followed correctly, and we find a row where the opponent is \"cleber luciano\" and its time is greater than any other times in the table, then output the following JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim\",\n    \"Locate relevant rows based on opponent's name\",\n    \"Compare times of those rows\",\n    \"Verify consistency across all records\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"time\" }\n  ]\n}\n\nIf we are unable to find a row that satisfies the conditions, then output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim\",\n    \"Locate relevant rows based on opponent's name\",\n    \"Compare times of those rows\",\n    \"Verify consistency across all records\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
