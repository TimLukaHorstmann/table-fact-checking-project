The series name can be found by examining the header row of the table, where each episode's information is labeled. In this case, the series name is \"TV Series.\"\n\n2. Determine the episode number to check against the 56th episode. The 56th episode can be calculated as half the total number of episodes. As there are no headers for the row numbers in the table, we need to count the rows manually. From the table provided, the first row is a header row and does not represent an episode. So, counting from the second row, we have 65 episodes (the last one being the 65th). Half of that number is 32.5, but since episodes are numbered whole numbers, we can round up to 33 and subtract one to get the index for the 56th episode (i.e., 32 - 1 = 31st episode).\n\n3.
