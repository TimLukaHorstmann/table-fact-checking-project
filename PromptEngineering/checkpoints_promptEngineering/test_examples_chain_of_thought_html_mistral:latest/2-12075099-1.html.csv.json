Check each row in the table to see if the opponent column matches with \"rattlers\".\n3. Compare the home/away column for each \"rattlers\" match to check if it says \"away\". This is because the claim states that we are looking for a game where \"rattler\" is the away team.\n4. If both conditions (opponent = \"rattlers\" and home/away = \"away\") are met, then the corresponding field will be different from \"villanova stadium\".
