However, their name appears as \"claudia koch / peter sch\u00fcbl\" in the table.\n\n2. Iterate through the rows of the table, comparing the names (ignoring case since they match after converting to lowercase) with the given pair.\n\n3. If a match is found, compare the 'places' column value with 81st place. In this table, each row represents a different ranking from 1st to 20th. So, if the 'places' value matches 81 (or greater), then the claim is true.\n\n4. If no match is found in steps 2 and 3, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's check the table:\n\n- The pair \"claudia koch / peter sch\u00fcbl\" can be found in the row with index 20.\n- The 'places' column value for that row is 174. Since this number is greater than 81, the claim is true.\n\nHere is the output in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify skaters from given pair (ignoring case); Match rows with given pair; Compare places column value to 81st place\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"places\"}]\n}\n```",
