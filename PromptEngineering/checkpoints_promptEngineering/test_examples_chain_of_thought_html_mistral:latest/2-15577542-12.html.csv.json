We need to find the row where \"authors\" field contains \"frey buchy stinnesbeck gonzalez stefano\".\n\n3. Search for relevant data: In the table, we see that only one row (5th row) has authors as \"frey buchy stinnesbeck gonzalez stefano\".\n\n4. Check the location of the author: The same row also provides the location which is \"mexico\".\n\n5.

Evaluate the claim based on the matching data found: Since China (row 3) is the location of the Jiufotang formation and there is no association between the Jiufotang formation and Froebisch Fr\u00f6bisch, we have a partial match.
