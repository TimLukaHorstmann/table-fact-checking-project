According to the table, he managed 2 matches.\n\n3. Count the number of losses during Steve Corica's tenure. In his 2 matches, he lost all 2 matches (as indicated in the table).\n\n4. Compare the count of losses with the claim. The claim states that \"2 matches will be lost during the period from 12 November 2012 to 27 November 2012\".

    "resp": "Here are the steps for solving the problem:\n\n1. Understand the claim: No match will be lost when the number of matches managed is over 2 during the period from May 2012 - November 11, 2012. This means we only need to focus on the row of \"ian crook\".\n\n2. Find the relevant data for \"ian crook\": From the table, the row index for \"ian crook\" is 5 and the column names are \"name\", \"period\", \"managed\", \"drawn\", \"lost\". The relevant period (period from May 2012 - November 11, 2012) should be checked.\n\n3. Check if the number of matches managed is over 2: For \"ian crook\", the value in the \"managed\" column is 6. Since this is not greater than 2, we have a potential match for the claim.\n\n4. Check if any lost matches were recorded during the period: To find this, we need to look at the \"lost\" column. For \"ian crook\", the value in the \"lost\" column is 4.\n\n5. Compare the results with the claim: Since there are 4 lost matches and the number of managed matches (6) is not over 2, it means that the claim is FALSE as losses occurred during the specified period.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Understand the claim\", \"Find relevant data\", \"Check if number of managed matches is over 2\", \"Check for lost matches during the given period\", \"Compare results with the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"managed\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}]\n}",
