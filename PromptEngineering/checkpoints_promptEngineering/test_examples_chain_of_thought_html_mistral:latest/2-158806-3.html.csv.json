Locate the row in the table that corresponds to the value specified in the claim (1 \u20a7). Since the table has columns 'value' and 'equiv', we should focus on the 'value' column, where the currency symbol is present, as this indicates the value being referred to in the claim.\n\n3. Compare the found row with the required dimensions:\n   - Check if the diameter matches: The value of 1 \u20a7 has a diameter of 14 mm (row 0, column 'diameter'). This is correct as per the table data.\n   - Check if the weight matches: The value of 1 \u20a7 weighs 0.55 g (row 0, column 'weight'). This is also correct as per the table data.\n\n4.

In the table, this corresponds to the row with the \"value\" of \"100 \u20a7\".\n\n2. Find the column for the diameter: We are asked to find the diameter, so we look for the corresponding column in the table, which is labeled as \"diameter\".\n\n3. Compare the given value and the value from the table: According to the claim, the equiv (equivalent weight) of the 100 \u20a7 coin is 0.60. We need to check if this matches with any row in the table. In the table, there is a row where the equiv is indeed 0.60.\n\n4. Verify that the diameter is 24.5 mm: Finally, we look at the \"diameter\" value for the row where the equiv was matched (row 7).
