This will help me understand the distribution of releases across different regions.\n\n2. Next, I will look for any rows where the 'country' column has the value \"canada\".\n\n3. Since the claim states that there is \"1 release date in canada\", I will then check if there exists a row with both the country as \"canada\" and the release date being the same (ignoring the specific year for now).\n\n4. If I find such a row, it means that the claim is true.
