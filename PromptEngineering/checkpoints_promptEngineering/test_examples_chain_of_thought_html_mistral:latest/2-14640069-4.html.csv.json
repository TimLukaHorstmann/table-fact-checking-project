Check the table's structure: There are five players listed, ranked from 1 to 5, with columns for rank, player name, country, earnings, and wins.\n   3. Compare the claim's conditions:\n       a. Find the player(s) ranked higher than 3rd (rows with a rank less than or equal to 3). In this case, it's Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson, and Tom Kite.\n       b. Check their earnings (earnings column): If a player has earnings of 3315502, only Lee Trevino satisfies this condition.\n   4. Verify the wins for the identified player: In the wins column, Lee Trevino has 29 wins.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim's conditions\", \"Find players ranked higher than 3rd\", \"Check earnings of these players\", \"Verify wins for the identified player with matching earnings\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"earnings\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"wins\" }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that Lee Trevino's rank is lower than Tom Kite's with 3315502 earnings and 29 wins.\n\n2. Compare ranks based on earnings: In the table, ranks are determined by earnings (highest to lowest). We will compare the earnings of Lee Trevino and Tom Kite. If Lee Trevino's earnings are lower than Tom Kite's, then his rank would be higher (since lower rank indicates higher earnings).\n\n3. Compare earnings: In the table, Lee Trevino has earnings of 3315502 and Tom Kite has earnings of 3445007. Therefore, Tom Kite has higher earnings than Lee Trevino.\n\n4. Determine rank based on earnings comparison: Since Tom Kite has higher earnings than Lee Trevino, their ranks would be in reverse order. That is, if Tom Kite's rank is 3, then Lee Trevino's rank should be greater than 3.\n\n5. Conclusion: The claim \"Lee Trevino rank lower than tom kite with 3315502 earnings and 29 win\" is FALSE because Lee Trevino has a higher rank (or equal to) than Tom Kite based on the provided table data.\n\nHere's the final JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Compare ranks based on earnings\", \"Compare earnings\", \"Determine rank based on earnings comparison\", \"Conclusion\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"earnings\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"earnings\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
