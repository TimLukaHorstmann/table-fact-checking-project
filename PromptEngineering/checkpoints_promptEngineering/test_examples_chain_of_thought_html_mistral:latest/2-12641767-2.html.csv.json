    "resp": "Here are the steps in my reasoning:\n1. Identify the specific date mentioned in the claim: October 25, 2009\n2. Iterate through the table to find the row(s) that match the specified date\n3. For each matching row, check if the outcome column (which contains either \"winner\" or \"runner - up\") matches the condition mentioned in the claim (\"achieved\" is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred as equivalent to \"was the outcome\").\n4. If a matching row is found where the outcome corresponds to \"runner - up\", then find the corresponding score column and check if it matches the score given in the claim (1-6 6-1 3-6).\n\nWith this reasoning, we can examine the table and find that the 9th row has a date of October 25, 2009 and the outcome is \"runner - up\". The corresponding score column for this row is [1, 6, 1, 3, 6], which matches the score given in the claim.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify date from claim, Find rows that match specified date, Check if outcome matches 'runner - up', If yes, check if score matches given score\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"outcome\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}",
