Locate the row corresponding to the identified programme in the table: In the given table, \"art attack\" can be found in the second row with the index 1.\n3. Check the fourth column (date of original removal) for the identified programme: For the given programme, the date of original removal is mentioned as \"13 july 2007\".\n4. Compare the identified date with the channel mentioned in the third column (original channel (s)): In this case, the original channel is \"citv\". However, it's important to note that a programme can have multiple channels, so checking only one isn't conclusive. Unfortunately, the table does not provide any information about whether \"art attack\" had additional original channels beyond \"citv\".\n5. Since there isn't enough information in the given table to confirm or refute the claim with absolute certainty due to the potential existence of multiple original channels, it is recommended to seek more comprehensive data before making a definitive conclusion.\n\nHowever, for this specific table and the available data, we cannot confidently determine whether \"art attack be originally broadcast on citv\".\n\nIn JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify programme of interest\",\n    \"Locate row corresponding to identified programme\",\n    \"Check date of original removal for the identified programme\",\n    \"Compare the identified date with channel mentioned in the third column (original channel)\",\n    \"Consider potential existence of multiple original channels\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"INSUFFICIENT DATA\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"programme\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date (s) of original removal\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original channel (s)\" }\n  ]\n}",

Locate all rows in the table that correspond to \"big brother\" (based on the 'programme' column). There are two such rows because there are two instances of \"big brother\" in the table.\n3. For each row corresponding to \"big brother\", check the date of return (column 'date of return'). The relevant dates for these rows are '9 september 2011' and also '9 september 2011'.\n4.
