In this case, it's 2005 since that is the year with multiple champions listed.\n\n2. Check the rows for the year 2005 in the table to determine the order of finish for the teams mentioned in the claim (Clemson, Champion, and Runner-up).\n\n3. In the second row of the table (which corresponds to the year 2005), we find that Elon is the champion (row_index=1, column_name=\"champion\"), Clemson is the runner-up (row_index=1, column_name=\"runner - up\"), and Miami is not listed in the top two positions.\n\n4. However, upon further examination of the semi-finalist 1 and semi-finalist 2 columns, we find that Longwood is the semifinalist 2 (row_index=2, column_name=\"semi - finalist 2\") for the Miami team in the same year (2005).\n\n5. Since Clemson appears before Miami in terms of their positions, and there are no additional information suggesting that the order changed in the semi-finals or finals, it is reasonable to assume that Clemson placed third (behind the champion Elon and runner-up Clemson).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the year for which we need to check the claim\", \"Check the rows for the specified year\", \"Determine the order of finish for the teams mentioned in the claim\", \"Examine the semi-finalist columns for additional information\", \"Assess if Clemson placed third (behind the champion and runner-up) based on the given data\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\":\"champion\"}, {\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\":\"runner - up\"}, {\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\":\"semi - finalist 2\"}]\n}",
