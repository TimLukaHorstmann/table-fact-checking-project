    "resp": "Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n1. Identify the number of games played at Boston Garden by counting the number of rows where the 'location / attendance' column contains \"Boston garden\". In this table, there are 8 such rows (games with row indices 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16).\n2. Next, check if all the games at Boston Garden took place before December 17 by comparing the 'date' column of each game played at Boston Garden to the date \"December 17\". In this table, all the dates for games played at Boston Garden are earlier than December 17 (from row indices 2 to 14).\n3. Since all the games at Boston Garden took place before December 17, and there were 8 such games, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe final answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Count number of games played at Boston Garden by checking 'location / attendance' column.\\nCompare the 'date' column for each game played at Boston Garden to December 17.\\nCheck if all the dates are earlier than December 17.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}",
