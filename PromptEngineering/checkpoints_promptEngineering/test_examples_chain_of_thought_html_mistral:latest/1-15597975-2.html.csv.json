To do this, scan through the 'locale' column to find the row where the value matches 'nova scotia'. In this case, it is the 11th row.\n\n2. Now that we have found the correct row, check the 'pf' (percentage of stones placed in the house) column for the corresponding player: Brian Rafuse. The value for this cell is 60 as expected.\n\n3.
