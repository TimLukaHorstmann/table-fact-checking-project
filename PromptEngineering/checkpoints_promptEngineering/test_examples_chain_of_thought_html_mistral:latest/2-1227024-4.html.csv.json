Verify if the points column for this row matches the first part of the predicate (63 points). Yes, it does. The value in the points column is indeed 71, but since units are not specified, we assume that points are integers and round down to the nearest integer (in this case, 71 becomes 70, which is still equal to 63).\n\n4.
