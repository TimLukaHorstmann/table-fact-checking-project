The table does not contain any information about the teams' names, but it provides the score of each game.\n2. To find the highest scoring game, we compare all the scores in the table and choose the one with the greatest number in the \"Score\" column.\n3. After comparing all the scores, we find that the game between \"Taunton Town (1)\" and \"Crystal Palace\" has the highest score (6-0). No other game in the table has a higher score.\n4. Since this is the highest scoring game from the given data, and there's no indication of any other games in the 1930-31 FA Cup not included in the table, we can conclude that \"Taunton Town (1)\" vs. \"Crystal Palace\" has the highest scoring game within the 1930-31 FA Cup.\n\nanswer: TRUE\nrelevant_cells: [{\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}]",

To check if they won the replay game, we need to look at the result of the replay games for these teams.\n5. For gateshead, we can see that the result of the replay game is not provided in the table. So, we cannot definitively say whether they won or lost the replay game.\n6. For newport county, the result of their replay game shows a score of 4-1 in favor of newport county.\n7.
