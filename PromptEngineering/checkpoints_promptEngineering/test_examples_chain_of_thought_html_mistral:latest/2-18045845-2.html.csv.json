    "resp": "Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. First, I need to determine the competition for the given dates. The table provided only goes up to 2013, so we can't find information about the competitions on 23 January 2010 and 22 August 2012. However, if there were no competitions scheduled for those dates in the specified timeframe (2010-2013), it is likely that the matches did not take place.\n\n2. If a match did not take place, then both results for those dates would be considered as \"not played\" or \"no result\". In this case, \"draw\" could also be used as synonymous to \"no result\", but since the actual data is missing, we cannot definitively say that both matches were draws.\n\n3. Without sufficient evidence, I can't confidently conclude whether the results for the competition on 23 January 2010 and 22 August 2012 be both d (draw).\n\nHere is the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Check for the competition details for given dates, find that no data is available beyond 2013.
