Find the row(s) where the fleet numbers are 428 - 430: Start scanning the rows looking for the specified fleet numbers. The first instance of a fleet number matching 428 or 430 is at row index 8, and the other match is at row index 9.\n4. Check if the manufacturer (make) appears exactly thrice for each of these fleet numbers: In row 8, the manufacturer is \"alco - schenectady\". Counting instances of this value in row 8 reveals that it appears 3 times. In row 9, the manufacturer is also \"alco - schenectady\", and counting instances of this value in row 9 shows that it also appears 3 times.\n5.
