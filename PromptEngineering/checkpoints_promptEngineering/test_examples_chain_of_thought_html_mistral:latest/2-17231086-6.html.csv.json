    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n   1. First, we need to find all the players from Wales. In the given table, only one player, Ian Woosnam, is from Wales.\n   2. Next, we need to check their money column (column 5). The amount of money for Ian Woosnam is mentioned in row 3 and column 5: 67823.\n   3. Lastly, we compare the found amount of money with the claimed most amount that can be won by someone from Wales: 46823. We find that the money won by Ian Woosnam (67823) is greater than the claimed maximum amount (46823).\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find all players from Wales\",\n    \"Check their money column and find out the amount of money won by Ian Woosnam\",\n    \"Compare it with the claimed maximum amount that can be won by someone from Wales\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"money\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
