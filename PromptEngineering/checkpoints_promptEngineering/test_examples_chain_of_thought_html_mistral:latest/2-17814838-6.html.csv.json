From the table, there are ties marked as \"replay\" which indicate a replay or second match between the same teams, so we will consider these matches as part of the same tie.\n\n2. Examine each such tie to find the highest total goal score by both teams in a single tie:\n   - For tie 1 (liverpool vs everton): Liverpool scored 1 and Everton scored 1 in the first match, Everton scored 1 and Liverpool scored 0 in the replay. So, the total goal score for this tie is 2 + 1 = 3.\n   - For tie 5 (hartlepool united vs west ham united): Hartlepool United scored 0 and West Ham United scored 2. No replay was recorded for this tie.\n   - For tie 7 (cardiff city vs Arsenal): Cardiff City scored 0 and Arsenal scored 4 in the first match, Arsenal scored 3 and Cardiff City scored 1 in the replay.

So, the total goal score for this tie is 4 + 2 = 6 (as of the end of first matches). Since there's no record of a third match, it seems that the highest total goal score for this tie remains at 6.\n   - For tie 15 (derby county vs nottingham forest): Derby County scored 1 and Nottingham Forest scored 1 in the first match, Nottingham Forest scored 2 and Derby County scored 3 in the replay. So, the total goal score for this tie is 4 + 3 = 7.\n   - For tie 16 (wolverhampton wanderers vs middlesbrough), no goal information was provided, so we can't determine if both teams scored more than 0 goals in this tie.\n\n3.
