In the table, the opponent's name is listed in the 'opponent' column and the date of the game can be determined from the 'date' column. However, since the dates are not provided in a format that allows easy sorting or filtering, I would need to manually search for the Cleveland Browns match and confirm its corresponding week number (week 17).\n\n2. Next, I will check if there is an attendance value listed for the row where the opponent is Cleveland Browns and the week number is 17. The attendance values are found in the 'attendance' column and the week numbers are in the 'week' column. If there is a match between these two conditions, it means that the game did have an attendance.\n\n3. Finally, I will compare the attendance value with the given claim of 73528. If the obtained attendance value from step 2 matches the claimed attendance (73528), then the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, if the obtained attendance value does not match or there is no attendance value for that row, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe JSON output will be:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the week and opponent of the game against Cleveland Browns\", \"Check if there's an attendance value for the identified game\", \"Compare the obtained attendance with the claimed attendance (73528)\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE/FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": \"\",\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
