Compare the given table with the claim: Go through each row of the table to check if any opponent named \"Michigan\" played a game at \"Memorial Stadium, Minneapolis, MN\".\n3. Find relevant cells: If the opponent is Michigan and the site is Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis, then the claim is true.\n4.
