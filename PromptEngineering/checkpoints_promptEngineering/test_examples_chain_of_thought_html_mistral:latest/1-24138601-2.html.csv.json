Since we are looking at the score that was given up by Argonaut, we only consider rows where the first number is greater than or equal to 44.\n3. Inspect each of these rows one-by-one to check whether they correspond to games played against the Argonaut. In the table provided, there are no such rows where the opponent's score is exactly 44 points. However, we find two rows where the team scored 44 points but the order of the scores suggests that Argonaut was the opposing team in both instances (e.g., 'l 44 - 7').\n4. To confirm that these games were played against the Argonaut, we need to look at the 'opponent' column and ensure that it mentions a team called \"Argonaut\" or a similar name.

Identify the data structure: The data provided is a table with 7 columns (week, date, opponent, location, final score, attendance, record) and 12 rows. Each row represents a game played by an unspecified team.\n\n2. Understand the claim: The claim states that the \"Argonaut\" (which isn't mentioned in the table) gave up 44 points only once in the season.\n\n3. Find relevant data: In order to evaluate this claim, we need to identify and count instances where the \"final score\" column shows a value with 44 points or more for the team on the receiving end of the score. Since the table doesn't specify which team is the Argonaut, I will assume that they are the team with the lowest row index (first game) based on the sequence of dates.\n\n4. Extract data:\n   - Find the first row index by counting rows in the table where the \"date\" column is less than or equal to the date of the first game (August 19). In this case, it would be row index 0 since all the dates are sorted.\n   - Find the \"final score\" cell for the team that received 44 points in the game. In our example, we are looking at the team with the higher score in each game; if the final score shows more than 44 points, it means the other team gave up 44 or fewer points.\n\n5. Evaluate claim: After examining all the games in the table (10 in total), count the number of instances where the \"final score\" cell for the receiving team is 44 or more. In this case, we find one instance where this occurs (the first game with a final score of l 44 - 7).\n\n6.
