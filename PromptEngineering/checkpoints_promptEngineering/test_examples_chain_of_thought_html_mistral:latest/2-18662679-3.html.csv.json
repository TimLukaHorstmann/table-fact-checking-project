Determine the rowing time for Italy in the 2008 summer olympics: The time is given as \"5:36.42\" in row 2, column 'time'.\n\n3. Compare the rowing time of Italy with other countries:\n   - First, we compare with Australia (row 1). Their rowing time is \"5:36.20\", which is less than Italy's time, so they have a faster rowing time.\n   - Then, we compare with Russia (row 3). Their rowing time is \"5:39.18\", which is greater than Italy's time, so Italy has a faster rowing time.\n   - Lastly, we compare with the remaining countries (Estonia and Czech Republic), but their times are not provided for this specific event in the given table. However, since we have already found that Italy's time is less than that of two participating nations (Australia and Russia), it can be concluded that even if the times for other countries were compared, they would still not have a faster rowing time than Italy.\n\n4.
