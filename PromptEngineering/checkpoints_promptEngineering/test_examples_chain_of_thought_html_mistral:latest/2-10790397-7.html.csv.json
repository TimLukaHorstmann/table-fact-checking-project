In this case, there are six different venues: Corio Oval, Brunswick Street Oval, Windy Hill, Arden Street Oval, MCG, and Junction Oval.\n\n2. For each venue, count the number of matches played at that venue during the 1933 VFL season (as per the date in the table).

To find the venue with the highest crowd participation, we need to compare the 'crowd' column for each venue and select the one with the maximum value. In this case:\n   - The maximum number of people participating in a game at Corio Oval was 14000.\n   - The maximum number of people participating in a game at Brunswick Street Oval was 29500.\n   - The maximum number of people participating in a game at Windy Hill (the venue of interest) was not provided, but we know it has a value of either 9000 or less.\n   - The maximum number of people participating in a game at Arden Street Oval was 20000.\n   - The maximum number of people participating in a game at MCG was 18020.\n   - The maximum number of people participating in a game at Junction Oval was 21000.\n\n4.
