    "resp": "1. Identify the column names from the table, in this case: [\"Player\", \"Total 180\", \"Legs\", \"Total Points\"]\n2. Determine the number of legs for the player with 45 legs (Total Points) by finding the row corresponding to 45 in the \"Total Points\" column and identifying the value in the \"Legs\" column. In this case, the relevant cell would be: {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Legs\"}\n3. Observe that the value found in step 2 is 45. This means the player with 45 total points has played 45 legs.\n4. Recall that a leg is a set of three darts thrown in sequence to score the maximum possible score on each dart, which is 30 (a double bullseye or a triple 20). In order for this player to have scored more than 18 180s (triple 20), he would need to have thrown at least 20 legs (since 20*3=60, and 60-45=15, which exceeds 18).\n5. Since a leg is composed of three darts, we now calculate the number of single dart 180s required for each leg by multiplying the number of legs by 3: 20*3 = 60\n6. Observe that in the table there's no direct column indicating the number of single 180s thrown per player, so we cannot confirm or deny the claim without additional information.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to definitively say whether the player with 45 legs has more than 18 180s, our answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify column names\", \"Determine leg count for player with 45 total points\", \"Recall that a leg consists of 3 darts\", \"Calculate single dart 180s required\", \"Observe that we lack information on the number of single 180s thrown\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Legs\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the claim, which states that all players who have won 5 legs (matches) have a 3-dart average of 95.39.\n2. Check if there's any consistent pattern in the table that can help us identify the players who have won 5 legs. In this case, the \"Legs\" column helps us find these players as it lists the number of legs won by each player.\n3. From the table, we find the following players who have won 5 legs: [ {\"row_index\": 0}, {\"row_index\": 1}, {\"row_index\": 2}, ..., {\"row_index\": 9} ] (There are 10 players with 5 wins.)\n4. To verify if all these players have a 3-dart average of 95.39, we need to check the \"Average\" column for each of them. The \"Average\" column represents the 3-dart average for each player.\n5. Examine the values in the \"Average\" column for the identified players: [ {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Average\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Average\"}, ..., {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Average\"} ]\n6. Compare each of these values with the target average (95.39). If all the values are equal to or very close to 95.39 (to account for potential rounding errors), then the claim is true.\n7. In this case, not all players who have won 5 legs have a 3-dart average of exactly 95.39. Some of them are slightly above and some below that value. However, it seems there might be an error in the provided data as the averages appear to vary significantly for players with similar leg count (5).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Find players who have won 5 legs\",\n    \"Check if all these players have a 3-dart average of 95.39\",\n    \"Compare the 'Average' column values for the identified players with 95.39\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Legs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Average\"},\n    ...,\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Average\"}\n  ]\n}",
