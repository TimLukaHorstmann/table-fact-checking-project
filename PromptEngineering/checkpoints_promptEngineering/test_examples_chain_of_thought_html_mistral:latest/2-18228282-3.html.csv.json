    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to answer the claim:\n\n1. First, identify all players from the table who have a current club (`current club` column) as `gran canaria`. In our table, there's only one player meeting this condition, which is 'carl english'.\n\n2. Next, check if the position of 'carl english' is `c`. According to the table, his position is indeed `c`.\n\n3. Finally, verify if 'carl english' has a height less than 2.04 meters (since all heights are in decimal format, we can consider this as < 2.04). In our table, 'carl english' has a height of 1.95, which is less than 2.04, so it satisfies the condition.\n\nThe JSON answer would be:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find all players with current club as gran canaria\",\n    \"Check if any player among them has position 'c'\",\n    \"Verify if the player with position 'c' has height less than 2.04\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"current club\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"height\" }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to check the claim:\n\n1. Identify the player whose birthday we are trying to verify, which is Rowan Barrett from the table.\n2. Look for the row corresponding to this player by finding its row index (let's say it's \"row_index\").\n3. Check the fourth column of the identified row (since the year of birth is in this column), as this column contains the date of birth and age of each player.\n4. Extract the actual date of birth from the cell in the fourth column corresponding to the identified row (let's call it \"date_of_birth\").\n5. Compare the extracted date with the claim date, February 21st, 1984.\n6. If both dates are equal, then the claim is TRUE.
