Find the row that corresponds to 'gallop' in the table, which is row 7 (since 'gallop' is in the first column and the rows are numbered starting from 0).\n3. Check the third column of this row, which contains the information about the external weapon. In this case, it says 'pole mace'.\n4. Since the external weapon listed for gallop is not 'two shortswords', the claim does not hold true based on this condition.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the knight in question (gallop).\", \"Find the row corresponding to 'gallop' (row 7)\", \"Check the third column of the identified row for external weapon information.\", \"Compare the found value with the required value ('two shortswords').\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"external weapon\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
