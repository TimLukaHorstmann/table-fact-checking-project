So there are 5 wins in total.\n\n2. Next, we count the number of losses (games where the result is not 'w'). Since the table only includes games where the result is 'w', we cannot find any losses directly from this data. However, a loss is usually indicated by an opposite result such as 'l'. In the final match on row 7, the result is 'l' and thus represents one loss.\n\n3. To determine if there are additional losses that were not explicitly listed in the table, we look at the context given in the question which refers to \"this season.\" Since the given data goes up until May (the final match of the season), it implies that all games played during the season are included in the table. Therefore, the loss on row 7 is the only loss for the team during this season.\n\n4. Finally, we compare the number of wins and losses.
