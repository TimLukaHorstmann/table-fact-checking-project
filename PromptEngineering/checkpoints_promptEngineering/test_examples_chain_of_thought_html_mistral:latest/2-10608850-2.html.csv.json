To determine if a name (in this case, \"squadron\") is more popular than any other, we need to find all instances of the name \"squadron\" and compare their count with the counts of all other unique names in the table.\n2.

Next, identify all unique names (column \"Name\" or any other column that contains a unique identifier for each squadron).\n5. For each unique name, count the number of times it appears in the table.\n6. Compare the count of instances of \"squadron\" with the counts of all other unique names.

Next, scan the provided table for any patterns or useful information that could help answer the question.
