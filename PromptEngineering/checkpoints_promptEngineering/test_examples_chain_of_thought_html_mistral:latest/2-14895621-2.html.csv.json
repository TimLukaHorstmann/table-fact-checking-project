In the table, we see that Kang Haeng-Suk participated and won 3 times at the \"world championships\" event (since the outcome is always \"world championships\"). However, there are only two instances where he participated with a partner, one in 1985 (row 2) and another in an unspecified year (not provided in the table).\n\n3. Now, for the claim: \"hwang sun partnered with kang haeng 3 time at tournament\".

Next, we search for any rows in the table where 'kang haeng' appears as a partner. This helps us find instances of 'kang haeng' participating in different events and years.\n3. We then look for instances where 'kang haeng' participated in the world championships, since that is the specific event mentioned in the claim. In this table, we only have one instance of 'kang haeng' participating in a world championship: in 1985. However, there is no partner listed for him in that row.\n4. Lastly, we check if the venue matches Calgary, Canada in any of the instances where 'kang haeng' participated with his partner. Since this information doesn't appear to be present in the table, we cannot confirm if it matches Calgary.\n5. The claim states that 'hwang sun' first partnered with 'kang haeng' at the 1985 world championship in Calgary, Canada, but there is no instance in the table where 'hwang sun' appears as a partner for any event, including the 1985 world championship.\n6.

Identify the key information in the claim: The claim mentions a partner named 'hwang sun', an event named '1985 india open', and a specific outcome (finishing first).\n\n2.

Assess whether there is any information that can help determine if 'hwang sun' participated at the '1985 india open': Since I couldn't find any information about 'hwang sun', I check if there are any instances where another partner (kang haeng in this case) competed at the '1985 india open'.\n\n4. Investigate if kang haeng participated at the '1985 india open': I look for rows where the year matches 1985 and the event name is either equal to or contains \"india open\". The table shows that there was an entry for kang haeng in 1985 with the event being the India Open.\n\n5. Check if kang haeng won at the '1985 india open': I look for the outcome of the row where kang haeng participated at the '1985 india open'. The table shows that kang haeng finished first (with a value of 1 in the table).\n\n6. Determine if there is any information about whether kang haeng won an Asian game: I scan through the table for rows where the event name matches \"asian games\" and look for instances where kang haeng was the partner. The table shows that kang haeng participated at the 1982 Asian Games and won (with a value of 1 in the table).\n\n7. Assess if the year after the Asian games win is 1985: The Asian Games took place in 1982, so the year immediately following would be 1983. Since we are looking for the year 1985, I consider this as a non-match.\n\n8. Conclude that the claim is FALSE: The claim states that \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng at the 1985 india open finish first, 2 years after winning the Asian games\". However, I couldn't find any evidence in the table that supports this statement as hwang sun wasn't a partner with kang haeng at any event, and even if we consider kang haeng's win at the 1985 India Open, it was not two years after winning the Asian Games.\n\nHere is the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify key information\",\n    \"Check for hwang sun entries\",\n    \"Investigate kang haeng's participation at the '1985 india open'\",\n    \"Check if kang haeng won at the '1985 india open'\",\n    \"Assess kang haeng's win at Asian Games\",\n    \"Determine if it was 2 years after winning the Asian games\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"event\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"outcome\" }\n  ]\n}",

Next, I searched for rows in the table where the 'partner' column matches the partner specified in the claim (i.e., kang haeng). The row indices that satisfy this condition are 2 and 4.\n\n3. Then, I checked if there are multiple entries for these two indices within the given timeframe (1982-1985). In row 2, the year is 1982, which falls outside of the specified timeframe, so we can disregard this entry. In row 4, the year is 1985, which falls within the specified timeframe.\n\n4. After finding one entry within the given timeframe for the partner and the relevant years, I checked if there were more than one venue mentioned in those entries. In row 4, the venue is \"india open,\" which appears only once among the rows that match the partner and the timeframe.\n\n5. Since we found only one venue (\"india open\") for the specified partner and timeframe, I concluded that the claim is not entirely accurate because they did not finish in the top 3 at 3 different venues from 1982 to 1985.

Determine the events in which Kang Haeng participated: From the table, we see that there are three main types of events - world championships, Asian games, and other open tournaments.\n\n3.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the person of interest: In this case, the person of interest is \"hwang sun\". However, the table does not contain information about \"hwang sun\" directly. But, we know that her partner is \"kang haeng - suk\", so we focus on the rows where the partner's name appears.\n\n2. Check for the partner: We need to find the rows where the 'partner' column contains \"kang haeng - suk\". There are three such rows (1982, 1985 Asian Games and 1985 India Open).\n\n3. Check for the outcome: In each of these three rows, we need to check if the 'outcome' column shows that they finished first (i.e., a number 1 in this column). For the 1982 Asian Games and 1985 India Open, they did finish first (the 'outcome' is 1). However, for the 1985 Asian Games, the 'outcome' is not provided, so we cannot confirm whether they finished first in that event.\n\n4. Check for different venues: To determine if they finished first at 3 different venues, we need to see if these three events happened at 3 different venues. In this case, the 1982 Asian Games took place in New Delhi, India; the 1985 Asian Games venue is not provided but it seems to be a different event from the 1982 one as it has a different 'year'; and the 1985 India Open took place in India. These are three distinct locations, so they indeed finished first at 3 different venues.\n\nFinal answer (in JSON format):\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the person of interest: hwang sun\",\n    \"Check for the partner: Find rows where the 'partner' column contains kang haeng - suk\",\n    \"Check for the outcome: For these rows, check if the 'outcome' column shows they finished first (number 1)\",\n    \"Check for different venues: See if these three events happened at 3 different venues\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"partner\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"outcome\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"outcome\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\" }\n  ]\n}",
