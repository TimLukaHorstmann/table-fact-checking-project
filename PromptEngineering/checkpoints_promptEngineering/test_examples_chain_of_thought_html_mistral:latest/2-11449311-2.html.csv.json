Observe that the table contains a column named \"Wins\" (column_name: \"W\") and a row numbering system (row_index).\n3. Check the value of each row in the \"W\" column, as this represents the number of wins for the Buccaneers in each game.\n4.

Count the number of rows where the value in the \"W\" column is 1 (i.e., a win), and note that two such rows exist.\n6. Check the position of these winning rows within the table; they are located at row_index: 10 and 12.\n7. Since there are 16 total games, and 2 wins, it follows that the Buccaneers must have lost the remaining games (i.e., 14 losses).\n8. The number of losses for a team in a season can be calculated by subtracting the number of wins from the total number of games played, which is 16 - 2 = 14.\n9.
