Compare their scores against each other for all matches involving both teams (using the \"visitor\" and \"home\" columns)\n3. If there is a match where the score is higher for Washington against Ottawa, then the claim is TRUE\n4. Else, if there is no such match or the score is higher for Washington against Atlanta, then the claim is FALSE\n\nTo find the relevant rows in the table:\n- Row 5 and row 8 have \"washington\" as the visitor (column 2) which means they are playing away games. So we look at the home team column to see who they are playing against.\n- In row 5, the home team is Ottawa (column 4), and in row 8, the home team is Ottawa as well. This gives us two data points to compare: Washington's score against Ottawa on November 8 and Washington's score against Ottawa on November 30.\n- We need to find Washington's score against Atlanta as a comparison. To do this, we look for rows where \"washington\" is the visitor (column 2) and the home team is Atlanta (column 4). The only matching row is row 6, where Washington lost 1-3 on November 21.\n\nAfter comparing these data points, it can be observed that Washington scored more points against Ottawa on both November 8 (5 points) and November 30 (3 points), while they scored only 1 point against Atlanta on November 21.
