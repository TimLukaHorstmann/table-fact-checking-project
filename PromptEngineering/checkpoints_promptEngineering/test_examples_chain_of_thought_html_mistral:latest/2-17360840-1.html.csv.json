One is against New York Rangers on September 25 and the other one is not specified in terms of the opponent. Since the claim only mentions New York Rangers playing at Madison Square Garden, we need to filter out the row without a specific opponent.\n3. After filtering out the irrelevant rows, we are left with one row where the 'opponent' column matches 'New York Rangers' and the 'location' column matches 'Madison Square Garden'. This means the Lightning did play in Madison Square Garden.\n4. The final step is to verify if this matches the claim. The claim states \"the lightning play in madison square garden 2 times\". We found one occurrence where the Lightning played in Madison Square Garden, so we don't have a second occurrence as specified in the claim.
