Next, we need to find the row that corresponds to the \"Charles Schwab Cup Championship\". In this case, it's the 9th row with the date \"nov 3 , 2013\".\n\n3. We then examine the 'runner (s) - up' column of this row. It shows \"bernhard langer , mark o'meara , peter senior\", indicating there were multiple runner-ups for this tournament.\n\n4. To confirm whether this is the only tournament with multiple runner-ups, we need to check other rows in the table. We compare the 'runner (s) - up' columns of each row to see if any other tournament has more than one runner-up.\n\n5.

This will help me determine if the claim that \"there be 4 tournament in 2010\" is true or false.\n\n3. Next, since the claim also mentions that one of these tournaments was won by Tommy Armour III, I will identify the row where Tommy Armour III won a tournament by looking for his name in the 'runner (s) - up' column and finding the corresponding row index.\n\n4. If there are exactly 4 rows with dates from 2010, and one of them has Tommy Armour III as the runner-up (which indicates he was the winner), then the claim is true.
