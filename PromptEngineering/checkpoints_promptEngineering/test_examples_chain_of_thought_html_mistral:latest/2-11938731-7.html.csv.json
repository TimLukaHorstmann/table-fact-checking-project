    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify all players who have at least 1 sack to check if there's a pattern for touchdowns (td 's) among them.\n2. Filter the table to only include rows where the 'sack' column is greater than or equal to 1.\n3. Examine the 'td 's' values in the resulting filtered rows.\n4. Check if there's a consistent number of touchdowns (td 's) among those players who have at least 1 sack.\n5.
