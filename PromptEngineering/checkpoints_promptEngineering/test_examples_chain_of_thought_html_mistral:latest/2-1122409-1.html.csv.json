Find the relevant data for silvio moser in the table: To check if silvio moser is in the table, we need to look at the 'driver' column and find a row with the value \"silvio moser\". In this case, the row with index 12 has the driver as \"silvio moser\".\n3. Find the relevant data for the grid position: To check if silvio moser started from grid position 13, we need to look at the 'grid' column in the row where we found silvio moser. In this case, the grid position for silvio moser is 13 (row index 12 and column name 'grid').\n4. Compare the findings: The driver \"silvio moser\" started from the grid position 13, which matches the claim.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Find the relevant data for silvio moser\",\n    \"Find the relevant data for the grid position\",\n    \"Compare the findings\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": 'driver' },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": 'grid' }\n  ]\n}",

Look at each row of the table to find the one with the \"driver\" cell equal to \"John Miles\".\n3. Check the \"constructor\" column of the identified row to see if it matches \"brm\", as per the claim.\n4. Verify that the value in the \"time / retired\" or any other column related to completion status does not have a positive number, indicating retirement. If there is a positive number, it means the driver did not retire but was classified with a time.\n5. Check the number of laps completed by counting the number in the \"laps\" column for the identified row and verify that it equals 3 as per the claim.\n6.

Compare the given claim with the information obtained from steps 1-5: The claim states that Silvio Moser retired after 9 laps due to an oil leak in grid 13, but according to the table, he retired due to a fuel leak (not oil leak).
