    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the average calculation, which requires finding the sum of a set of numbers and dividing it by the count of those numbers. In this case, we are looking for the average of results that are 28 or 17.\n\n2. Search through the table to find rows where the result column matches either \"28\" or \"17\". For each match, store the row index and the result value for future use.\n\n3. Sum up all the found values corresponding to the results (28 or 17).\n\n4.
