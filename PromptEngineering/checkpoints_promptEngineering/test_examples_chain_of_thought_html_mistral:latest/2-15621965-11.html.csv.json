Identify the claim to be verified: The claim is that there are 2 players from Nebraska, and they are Tyronn Lue with years in Orlando as 2003-2004 and 2009.\n2. Examine the table column by column:\n    - In the \"player\" column, we find multiple entries, but we are looking for players from Nebraska.\n    - In the \"nationality\" column, all entries are US citizens, which is not helpful in this context.\n    - In the \"position\" and \"years in orlando\" columns, these details are specific to individual players and do not help in identifying players from Nebraska.\n    - The crucial information lies in the \"school / club team\" column since it contains the colleges that the players attended.\n3. Search for rows where the \"school / club team\" is Nebraska:\n    - There are two rows with \"nebraska\" as the value in the \"school / club team\" column.\n4. Check the player names from the rows identified in step 3:\n    - The players are Tyronn Lue (two entries)\n5. Verify the years in Orlando for each player found in step 4:\n    - The first row of Tyronn Lue has a range of years \"2003-2004\" in the \"years in orlando\" column.\n    - The second row of Tyronn Lue has a single year \"2009\" in the \"years in orlando\" column.\n6.
