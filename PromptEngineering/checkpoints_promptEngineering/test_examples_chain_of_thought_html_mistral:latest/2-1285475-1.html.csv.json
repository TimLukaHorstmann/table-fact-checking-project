Check if there is a row that matches the m47d20 engine and has a power rating of 100 kw (134hp) at 4000 rpm: There is no such row in the table for the m47d20 engine. The first row has a power rating of 85 kw (114hp) and the second row has a power rating of 100 kw (134hp), but neither is at 4000 rpm.\n\n6.
