    "resp": "chain_of_thought:\n1. The claim states that the seasons with a score of 0:1 are 2006 clausura, 2008 apertura, and 2006 clausura.\n2. To verify this claim, we need to check if there are indeed three matches in the table where the score is 0:1.\n3. We observe that the table contains multiple seasons with a score of 0:1; however, the claim only mentions three specific seasons (2006 clausura, 2008 apertura, and another 2006 clausura).\n4. To determine if these matches are correct, we need to look for rows in the table where the season column matches one of the mentioned years, and the score column has a value of 0:1.\n5. Upon checking the table, we find that there is indeed a match for the year 2006 (clausura) with a score of 0:1, which corresponds to the first two seasons specified in the claim. However, we cannot confirm whether the third season specified in the claim also matches a row with a score of 0:1 because there is no other occurrence of the year 2006 (apertura).\n6. Since the claim only specifies three instances and we can only verify two of them, we cannot definitively say whether the claim is true or false based on this information alone.\n\nanswer: \"UNKNOWN\"\nrelevant_cells: [{\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"season\"}, {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]",
