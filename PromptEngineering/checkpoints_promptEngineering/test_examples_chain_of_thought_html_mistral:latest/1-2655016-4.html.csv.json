    "resp": "1. Identify the column names for easier reference:\n   - season: the column number for the season number\n   - original air date: the column number for the air date of each episode\n\n2. Iterate through each row to find the rows corresponding to seasons 2 and 10. Let's store their indexes for easy access later.\n   - season 2: row_index = 2, where the value at that row and the \"season\" column is '2'.\n   - season 10: row_index = 10, where the value at that row and the \"season\" column is '10'.\n\n3. Extract the original air dates for seasons 2 and 10 from their respective rows:\n   - original air date of season 2: January 25, 1997 (from the cell in row_index = 2, column \"original air date\")\n   - original air date of season 10: January 11, 1997 (from the cell in row_index = 10, column \"original air date\")\n\n4. Calculate the difference between the two dates to check if they are almost exactly a year apart:\n   - Convert the given dates into date objects (JavaScript's Date object) for accurate comparison\n   - Get the difference in milliseconds between the two dates (using JavaScript's Date difference function)\n   - Divide the result by 1000 to get the number of days and then multiply by 365.25 (to account for leap years) to find the approximate number of years apart.\n   - Compare this value with 1 to check if they are almost exactly a year apart.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify column names\",\n    \"Find rows for season 2 and 10\",\n    \"Extract original air dates for seasons 2 and 10\",\n    \"Calculate the difference between the two dates to check if they are almost exactly a year apart\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"original air date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"original air date\" }\n  ]\n}",
