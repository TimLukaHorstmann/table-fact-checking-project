The claim states it was after game 4, so we look for rows where the 'game' column value is 4 or less.\n\n2. Determine the team's record at that point based on the 'record' column. The 'record' in row 4 (game 4) is \"4 - 0\".\n\n3. Compare the team's recorded wins and losses up to game 4 with the claim. If it matches, the claim is true; if not, the claim is false.
