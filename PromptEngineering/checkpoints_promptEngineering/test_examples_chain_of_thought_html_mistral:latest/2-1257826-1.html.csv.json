Each row contains information about a match: goal number, date, score, result, and competition.\n2. Iterate through each row to find the one(s) where the 'goal' column equals 3 (as per the claim). Only one row satisfies this condition, row 4 with a goal of 3 on 15 march 2001.\n3. Since no other rows satisfy the condition that the goal is 3, and since there is only one row where the goal is 3, the date of this match must be the date specified in the claim if there is a match with the claimed goal on that specific date.\n4. However, upon checking the date in row 4 (15 march 2001), it does not match the claimed date of 20 january 2001. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify each row in the table representing different matches\", \"Iterate through each row to find the one(s) where the 'goal' column equals 3 (as per the claim)\", \"Since only one row satisfies this condition, check the date of that match\", \"Compare the date of the match with the claimed date\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goal\"}]\n}",
