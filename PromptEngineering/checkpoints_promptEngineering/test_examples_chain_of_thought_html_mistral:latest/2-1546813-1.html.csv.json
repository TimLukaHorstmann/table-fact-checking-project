Check if the 'venue' column for these rows shows a location within the USA (by looking for rows where 'venue' contains the string \"usa\").\n4. Count the number of rows where both conditions (year from claim and venue in USA) are met.\n5. Compare the count with the total number of times the Solheim cup was hosted in the USA (from 1990 to 2013).\n\nNow, let's analyze the data based on these steps:\n\n- Identify the years given in the claim (from 1990 to 2013)\n- Iterate through each row in the table where 'year' column matches the years given in the claim.\n  - Row index 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 14 meet this condition.\n\n- Check if the 'venue' column for these rows shows a location within the USA (by looking for rows where 'venue' contains the string \"usa\").\n  - Rows 7, 9, 10, and 14 meet this condition.\n\n- Count the number of rows where both conditions (year from claim and venue in USA) are met.\n  - There are 4 such rows (7, 9, 10, and 14).\n\n- Compare the count with the total number of times the Solheim cup was hosted in the USA (from 1990 to 2013).\n  - From the data provided, it appears that the Solheim cup was hosted in the USA 6 times from 1990 to 2013.\n\nThe count of 4 matches the total number of times the Solheim cup was hosted in the USA during the specified time frame. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify years from claim (1990-2013), Iterate through each row where 'year' matches these years, Check if 'venue' contains the string 'usa', Count rows where both conditions are met, Compare count with total number of times Solheim cup was hosted in USA\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}",
