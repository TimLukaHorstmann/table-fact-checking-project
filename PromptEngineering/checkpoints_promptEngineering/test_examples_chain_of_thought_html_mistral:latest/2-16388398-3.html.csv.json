Find the match with the correct date: We need to find the row where the 'date' column equals \"sunday , 30 january\". In this table, there is only one such row (row index = 0).\n\n3. Identify the away team: In the identified row, the team playing as the away team is specified in the third column (column name = 'away team'). In this case, it's \"melbourne\" (row_index = 0, column_name = 'away team').\n\n4. Find the score of the away team: Now, we need to find the score of the identified team (i.e., Melbourne). The scores are given in the fourth column (column name = 'away team score'). In this case, the score for Melbourne on 30 January is \"19.11\" (row_index = 0, column_name = 'away team score').\n\n5. Check if the score matches the claim: Convert the claimed score (\"17.5\") to a format that can be compared with the table data.
