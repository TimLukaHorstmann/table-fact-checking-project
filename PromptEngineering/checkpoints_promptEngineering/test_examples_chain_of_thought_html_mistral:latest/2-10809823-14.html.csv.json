Look for the row with the venue named \"mcg\", as that's the venue we need to check if it had the highest crowd participation.\n4.

Compare this number with the crowds from other matches played at different venues on the same date (i.e., compare with the remaining rows in the table).\n6. If the crowd at the mcg is greater than or equal to any of the other venue's crowd numbers, then it is possible that the mcg had the highest crowd participation during the 1980 VFL season.\n7. In this case, we can see that the crowd number for the row with \"mcg\" (64054) is indeed greater than any other crowd number in the table, so it's possible that the mcg had the highest crowd participation during the 1980 VFL season.
