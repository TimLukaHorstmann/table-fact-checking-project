    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the competition for which the score is 3 - 0. In this table, there is only one row where the competition column indicates \"euro 2000 qualifying\" and the score column shows \"3 - 0\".\n\n2. Check if the competition for that specific match is indeed \"euro 2000 qualifying\". The row with the index 0 has the competition as \"euro 2000 qualifying\", which matches the requirement in the claim.\n\n3. Verify that the score for this particular match is indeed 3 - 0. In the same row, the score column shows \"3 - 0\", which also matches the requirement in the claim.\n\n4. Since all the conditions mentioned in the claim have been met (competition = \"euro 2000 qualifying\" and score = \"3 - 0\"), we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row where the competition column shows 'euro 2000 qualifying' and the score column shows '3 - 0'.\",\n    \"Verify that the competition for this specific match is indeed 'euro 2000 qualifying'.\",\n    \"Confirm that the score for this particular match is indeed '3 - 0'.\",\n    \"Since all the conditions mentioned in the claim have been met, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
