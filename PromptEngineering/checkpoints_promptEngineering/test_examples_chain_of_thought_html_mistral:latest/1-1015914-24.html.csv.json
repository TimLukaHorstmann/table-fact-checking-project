Find the corresponding cells for the subjects and objects in the table:\n    - For \"we two\", the relevant cells are nom-acc-inst (\"ngalbe\"), gen (\"ngalben\"), dat (\"ngalbelpa\"), abl (\"ngalbelngu\"), loc (\"ngalbeniya\").\n    - For \"them two (the two)\", the relevant cells are nominative plural (\"palai (boigu pale)\") for the subject case, but there's no direct match for dative plural \"palamulpa (boigu palemulpa)\" as it is not listed in the table.\n3. Compare the subjects and objects found: In this case, we are comparing the subject of the claim (\"them two\") with \"ngalbelpa\" which corresponds to the dataive plural form. Since there's no direct match for \"palamulpa (boigu palemulpa)\", we cannot make a comparison.\n4. Find an indirect way to compare the subjects and objects:\n    - To find out if \"palamulpa (boigu palemulpa)\" can be related to any of the subject forms, we need to understand the pattern between different cases in the table.\n    - Looking at the table, we can see that for each subject, there's a corresponding verb form that ends with \"-pa\". This suggests that the pattern might be consistent across all subject-verb pairs.\n5. Apply the found pattern to find a related form of \"them two\": Since the pattern seems to be consistent, we can try to find a related form for \"palamulpa (boigu palemulpa)\". If this related form ends with \"-pa\", then we have a match.\n    - For nominative plural, the subject is \"palai (boigu pale)\", so if we add \"-pa\" at the end, it becomes \"palapai (boigupalepa)\" which doesn't seem to correspond to any of the given verb forms. This suggests that the pattern may not be consistent in this case.\n6.

Identify the claim: The claim states that when 'we two' (ngalbelpa) is present, 'them two or the two' (palamulpa or boigu palemuniya) should also be present.\n\n2. Examine the table for the relevant cells: The table shows various forms of words in different cases and suffixes. We need to find where 'we two', 'them two or the two', and their respective cases are listed.\n\n3. Locate the rows corresponding to 'we two' (ngalbelpa) and 'them two or the two' (palamulpa, boigu palemuniya): The row containing 'we two' is at index 2 in the table (first row doesn't contain any data for these specific words). There's no direct row for 'them two or the two', but we can deduce it from the rows with singular forms since the claim also mentions a possible singular form.\n\n4. Find the case for 'we two': The case for 'we two' (ngalbelpa) in the given table is Dat.\n\n5. Deduce the corresponding case for 'them two or the two': As the claim suggests, if 'we two' is in the Dat case, then 'them two or the two' should be in a similar case like Dat, Locative (as no Ablative or Genitive forms are given for plural). In our table, we can see that 'them two or the two' (palamulpa) is indeed present in the Locative case.\n\n6. Confirm whether the given singular form corresponds to the possible singular form mentioned in the claim: The cell for the possible singular form of 'them two or the two' in the table mentions \"(as for singular)\", suggesting that there's no specific singular form for this word in this table. However, since our claim doesn't require an exact match for the singular form but rather a possibility, we can still consider it as valid.\n\n7.

Identify the subject and object of the claim: The subject is \"when we two be ngalbeniya\" and the object is \"them two (the two) be palamulpa (boigu palemulpa)\"\n   2. Find the relevant cells for the given subjects and objects in the table:\n      - For \"we two\", we look at the row that contains \"nom-acc-inst\" and find \"ngalbe\" which is the subject pronoun for 'we two' in the nominative case.\n      - For \"them two (the two)\", we note that there is no direct translation for \"the two\" provided, but there is an entry \"palai (boigu pale)\" in the table under \"who-two\". This seems to be a possible candidate for \"the two\" in the given context.\n   3. Determine if the subject and object cells are related: The subject cell for \"we two\" (ngalbe) is not directly related to the object cell for \"the two\" (palai or palamun). However, the table provides additional information about location, and in the locative case, both subjects correspond to the same forms: ngalbeniya and palamuniya.\n   4. Check if the relationship between the subject and object holds for the given locations: The claim states that \"when we two be ngalbeniya , them two (the two) be palamulpa (boigu palemulpa)\". In the locative case, \"we two\" is \"ngalbeniya\" and \"the two\" is either \"palai\" or \"palamun\". Since there is no direct translation for \"palamulpa\" provided in the table, we cannot confirm whether it corresponds to \"palai\" or not. However, since both subjects correspond to the same forms in the locative case, we can infer that if one holds true, so does the other.\n   5. Final answer: Since we cannot confirm whether \"palamulpa\" corresponds to \"the two\", we cannot definitively say that the claim is TRUE or FALSE. It seems plausible based on the provided information, but more context is needed to make a conclusive determination.\n\nFinal JSON output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the subject and object of the claim\", \"Find the relevant cells for the given subjects and objects in the table\", \"Determine if the subject and object cells are related\", \"Check if the relationship between the subject and object holds for the given locations\", \"Final answer\"],\n  \"answer\": \"INSUFFICIENT_INFO\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"we two\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"who-two\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"loc\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "Here is my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the cells that contain the words \"we two\" (nom - acc - inst: ngalbe) and \"you two\" (gen: ngipen). The relevant cells for \"we two\" are row 1, column 3 and for \"you two\" are row 2, column 5.\n\n2. Check if the form of \"ngalben\" in the table can be derived from the given form \"ngalbe\". In this case, adding an \"n\" to the end of \"ngalbe\" results in \"ngalben\", which is the same as the form provided in the table for gen (row 2, column 1).\n\n3. Check if there is any other relevant information or patterns that might contradict the claim. In this case, there seems to be no such contradiction.\n\n4. Combine the words \"ngalben\" and \"be\" (the subject-verb agreement in English) to form \"ngalben be\". The resulting phrase should correspond to the you two in the table.\n\n5. Since we have already identified that \"you two\" corresponds to ngipen, compare \"ngalben be\" with \"ngipen\". In this case, \"ngalben be\" can be rearranged as \"be ngalben\", which does not correspond to \"ngipen\". However, the claim is asking for \"ngalben be\" to represent \"we two\" in relation to \"you two\" (ngipeniya).\n\n6. The question asks if \"ngalben be\" represents \"we two\" in relation to \"you two\" ngipeniya. Since we have determined that the form of \"we two\" (ngalbe) is correctly represented as \"ngalben\" and that there seems to be no contradiction, we can conclude that the claim does not hold true with the given information.\n\n   Final answer:\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\n       \"Identify the relevant cells for 'we two' (ngalbe) and 'you two' (ngipen).\",\n       \"Check if 'ngalben' is derived from 'ngalbe'.\",\n       \"Look for any contradictory information in the table.\",\n       \"Compare 'ngalben be' with 'ngipen'.\",\n       \"Determine if 'ngalben be' represents 'we two' in relation to 'you two'.\",\n       \"Conclude based on the comparison and lack of contradiction.\"\n     ],\n     \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"we two\" },\n       { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"you two\" }\n     ]\n   }",
