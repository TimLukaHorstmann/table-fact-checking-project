    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that \"Selkirk - Interlake\" is the riding for the candidate \"Patricia Cordner\", who gained 9506 votes.\n2. Find the candidate's row in the table: We need to find a row where the candidate's name matches \"Patricia Cordner\". In this case, it can be found in the second-to-last row.\n3. Check the riding for the candidate: In the identified row, we can see that the \"riding\" column value is \"Selkirk - Interlake\".\n4. Check the number of votes for the candidate: In the identified row, we can also see that the \"votes\" column value is 9506.\n\nSince all three conditions (riding, candidate name, and vote count) match with the information given in the table, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the final JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Find the candidate's row in the table\",\n    \"Check the riding for the candidate\",\n    \"Check the number of votes for the candidate\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"riding\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"candidate\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"votes\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
