    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the claim: The claim states that if there is no competition in the men's doubles and the men's singles, then there will be no competition in the women's doubles as well, for the same year.\n\n2. Next, we observe the structure of the table: The table lists various years in the first column. Subsequent columns list the winners for different categories (men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles). Some rows span multiple years where there are no winners listed.\n\n3. We then check if there are any instances in the table where there is no competition in both the men's doubles and the men's singles for a given year:\n   - Rows 2 and 5 (1992-1996, 1999-2000): There are no entries in either the men's doubles or the men's singles column.\n   - Row 6 (2001): Although there is an entry for the men's singles winner, there is no entry for the men's doubles.\n\n4. Now we check if there is also no competition in the women's doubles for these years:\n   - Rows 2 and 5 (1992-1996, 1999-2000): There are entries in both the women's singles and the women's doubles columns. This contradicts the claim as there was competition in the women's doubles while there was no competition in the men's doubles and the men's singles for these years.\n   - Row 6 (2001): Although there is an entry in the women's singles column, there is no entry for the women's doubles. This aligns with the claim as there was no competition in the women's doubles while there was no competition in the men's doubles and the men's singles for this year.\n   - Row 3 (1997, 1998): There is no entry in the women's doubles column in both years but there is an entry in the men's doubles column during 1997 and 1998. This does not align with the claim as there was competition in the women's doubles for years before (and after) this period where there was no competition in the men's doubles and the men's singles.\n\n5. We find that only one instance (Row 6, 2001) in the table supports the claim. However, we cannot ignore the inconsistency in other years where no competition in the men's doubles and the men's singles does not necessarily mean no competition in the women's doubles.\n\nIn conclusion, since there are multiple contradictions to the claim in various instances in the table, it is not a consistent rule that can be applied across all rows in the table.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Understand the claim\",\n    \"Observe the structure of the table\",\n    \"Check for instances where there's no competition in both men's doubles and men's singles\",\n    \"Check if there is also no competition in women's doubles for those years\",\n    \"Analyze the consistency of the claim across all rows\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"women's doubles\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"women's doubles\" }\n  ]\n}",
