Check opponents' surfaces: Since we do not know which tournaments Galina Voskoboeva participated in, we cannot definitively say whether she has ever played a match on clay. However, by looking at her opponents' surfaces, we can see if any of them have clay matches. In this table, only one opponent (Alice Canepa) played on clay.\n\n4.

Identify the data type of the 'score' column: The score column appears to contain a description of match results, specifically sets won (first number) and sets lost (second number), separated by commas. This suggests that the scores are not numerical values but rather text strings.\n\n2. Determine if it is possible to extract points from the given data structure: Since the scores are represented as sets won and sets lost, we cannot directly extract an average number of points per match from this data. However, since each set is won by a fixed number of points (6), it might be possible to infer some information about the average number of games or sets Galina Voskoboeva wins or loses in her matches.\n\n3. Identify the relevant rows for Galina Voskoboeva: In this table, we do not have specific information about the player who competed in these matches. However, since the claim refers to \"Galina Voskoboeva,\" we can assume that the matches she played as a runner-up should be counted towards the average number of games/sets she loses. The relevant rows are:\n   - Row index 1: runner-up (28 january 2003)\n   - Row index 3: runner-up (3 october 2003)\n   - Row index 5: runner-up (8 november 2005)\n\n4. Extract the number of games lost in those matches: In each of the relevant rows, the score for Galina Voskoboeva is given as two sets lost (e.g., 4 - 6, 4 - 6). This means that in these matches, she lost a total of 2*3=6 games.\n\n5. Determine if the claim can be confirmed: Since we cannot extract an average number of points from this data structure, we cannot strictly confirm or disprove the claim \"on average, Galina Voskoboeva loses with only 4 points.\" However, based on the matches provided in the table, it is not true that she loses with only 4 points per game.
