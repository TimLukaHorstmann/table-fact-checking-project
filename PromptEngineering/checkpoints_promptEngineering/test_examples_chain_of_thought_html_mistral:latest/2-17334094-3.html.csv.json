Determine the location(s) specified in the claim: The claim states Arizona, Mexico, and Utah. Since the table does not provide separate columns for Mexico or specific cities within the United States, we can only consider data related to Arizona and Utah from the given table.\n3. Locate the row corresponding to the reservation in question: In this case, the first row since \"navajo indian reservation\" is the first listed in the table.\n4. Find the column for the specified year (1979): This is the third column from the right as it is the third year listed in the table's header.\n5. Compare the value at the identified cell with the given threshold (54.2): The value at the intersection of row 1 and column 3 (the cell with \"navajo indian reservation\" and 1979) is 47.3, which is lower than 54.2.\n6.

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine the truthfulness of the claim:\n\n1. Identify the reservation mentioned in the claim: The claim mentions \"arizona, new mexico, and south dakota\" which corresponds to the \"location\" column for the row with the \"reservation\" value of \"navajo indian reservation\".\n2. Check the year specified in the claim (2000) against the table: The table has data from 1969 up until 2000, so we can assume that the values for the year 2000 should be present and accurate for this table.\n3. Compare the given locations with the location data in the table: To find out if the specified locations (arizona, new mexico, and south dakota) match any row in the table, we need to consider that these regions are part of the \"location\" listed for the \"navajo indian reservation\".\n4. Check if the value at the intersection of the identified row and the year 2000 matches the claim: In this case, the value for the year 2000 for the \"navajo indian reservation\" is 46.5 which coincides with the number given in the claim.\n\nNow that we have followed these steps, let's present our final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the reservation mentioned in the claim\",\n    \"Check the year specified in the claim against the table\",\n    \"Compare the given locations with the location data in the table\",\n    \"Check if the value at the intersection of the identified row and the year 2000 matches the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"2000\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
