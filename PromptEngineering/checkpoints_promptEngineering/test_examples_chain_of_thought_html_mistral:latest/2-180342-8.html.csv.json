Find the years when it was the tallest structure, as per the \"years as tallest\" column.\n3. Check the starting year (1666) and compare with other structures to see if any had a longer duration of being the tallest structure.\n4. To determine if \"just under 3 centuries\" passed before another building was taller, we need to find the end year when it was the tallest structure and check the duration between that year and 1666 (the start year).\n5. Calculate the number of years between these two dates. Since the table does not provide specific information on the months or days, we will use centuries as our unit of measurement, noting that a century is approximately 100 years (365.25 x 100 = 36525 days).\n6. Compare the calculated number of centuries with the claim \"just under 3 centuries\".\n7.
