Determine who the best known prop player from Leicester is: To do this, we need to find the most well-known or prominent prop players in the table.\n3. Compare the given name with the identified list of players: If \"Steve Borthwick\" is among the props playing for Leicester and has a higher recognition than others at the same position, then he could be considered the best known player in that position for Leicester.\n4.
