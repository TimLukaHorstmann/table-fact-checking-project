Find the row corresponding to the condition: In the table, we need to find the row where the 'average % of vote per candidate' is 3.29%. However, there's no exact match for this value in the table. The closest match is the year 2005 with a 1.04% average.\n\n3. Check if the difference between the given percentage (3.29%) and the closest found percentage (1.04%) is significant: A difference of 2.25% might suggest that the condition is not met, as there seems to be no row with a closer match to 3.29%.\n\n4. However, it's important to note that averages can be calculated from data points other than whole rows in a table. For example, if two candidates shared a total of 1416 votes and had an average vote percentage of 3.29%, it would satisfy the condition even though there's no specific row in this table that meets the exact requirement.\n\n5.
