Identify the claim: The claim states that there is no team in the division with less than 13 teams and a position less than 8 for the seasons from 2003 to 2012.\n\n2. Understand the table structure: We have a table with five columns (season, division, tms, pos, fa cup) and 11 rows representing data from 2003 to 2012. The 'tms' column represents the number of teams, and the 'pos' column represents the position of the team within their division.\n\n3. Verify if there are any rows that meet the condition (less than 13 tms or pos less than 8): By examining each row in the table, we can see that the number of teams (tms) and positions (pos) for all seasons from 2003 to 2012 are greater than or equal to 13 and 8 respectively.\n\n4. Draw a conclusion: Since there is no row that meets the condition (less than 13 tms or pos less than 8), the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe final answer in JSON format would be:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Understand the table structure\",\n    \"Verify if there are any rows that meet the condition (less than 13 tms or pos less than 8)\",\n    \"Draw a conclusion\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
