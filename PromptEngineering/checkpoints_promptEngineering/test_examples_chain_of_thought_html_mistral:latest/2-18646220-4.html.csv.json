    "resp": "Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Compare the names of the athletes to check if Mikhail Yemelyanov is listed anywhere in the table. If not, then the claim is FALSE because there is no such athlete in the table.\n2. If Mikhail Yemelyanov is in the table, find his row index and note it down (let's call it 'Mikhail_row').\n3. Find Vadim Menkov's row index (let's call it 'Vadim_row'). The first athlete in the table is Vadim Menkov, so Mikhail_row > Vadim_row because the rows are sorted by rank and the lower the rank, the higher the row number.\n4. Compare the countries of Mikhail Yemelyanov and Vadim Menkov to check if they belong to the same country (kazakhstan and uzbekistan respectively). If not, then the claim is FALSE because the difference in time cannot be calculated for athletes from different countries due to the lack of direct comparison.\n5. If they are from the same country, find their times. Let 'Mikhail_time' be Mikhail Yemelyanov's time and 'Vadim_time' be Vadim Menkov's time.\n6. Calculate the difference in seconds between their times: (|Mikhail_time| - |Vadim_time|) * 60 (since times are given in minutes). This will give us the absolute difference in seconds.\n7. Compare the calculated difference with 22.534 to check if it's close enough (within a reasonable margin of error, e.g., 0.1 seconds) to the claimed difference between their times.
