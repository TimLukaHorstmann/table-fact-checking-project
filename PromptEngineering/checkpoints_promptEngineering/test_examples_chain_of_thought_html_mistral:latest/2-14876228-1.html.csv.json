In this case, the team is \"olimpia\" and its position is 10.\n2. Loop through each row of the table to find the row that corresponds to the given team and position. The relevant row will have a \"team\" value equal to \"olimpia\" and a \"position\" value equal to 10.\n3. Extract the value in the \"wins\" column from the found row, as this is the information needed to verify the claim.\n4. Compare the extracted value with the expected number of wins (2) according to the claim.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify team and position from the claim\", \"Loop through each row of the table\", \"Find the relevant row by matching 'team' and 'position'\", \"Extract the value in the 'wins' column\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}]\n}",
